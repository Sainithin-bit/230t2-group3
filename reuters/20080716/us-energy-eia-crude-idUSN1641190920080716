 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil inventories rose unexpectedly last week amid an uptick in imports and continued soft fuel demand in the world's top consuming nation, according to a government report Wednesday. 

 U.S. crude oil futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell more than $5 after the report to around $133 a barrel, the second big daily loss, pulling them about $14 below last week's all-time record. "The EIA builds across the board are the most bearish inventory data we've seen in a long while," said John Kilduff, senior vice president at MF Global in New York. Commercial crude inventories rose 3.0 million barrels to 296.9 million barrels, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration's weekly report, countering expectations for a 2.1 million barrel drop. The jump in stockpiles came as imports rose by 1.24 million barrels per day to 10.79 million bpd. "Imports bounced up big and psychologically, this indicates more willingness on the part of refiners to take possession of more crude," said Phil Flynn, analyst at Alaron Trading in Chicago. "They've been reluctant in the recent weeks to store more crude because of the high price of crude." Stockpiles of gasoline and distillates also rose as refiners boosted production slightly and demand remained weak, according to the EIA. Gasoline supplies rose 2.4 million barrels to 214.2 million and distillate stocks rose 3.2 million barrels to 125.7 million barrels, according to the report. Both gasoline and distillates, which include diesel and heating oil, are in the upper end of the average range for this time of year, said the EIA, the statistical arm of the Energy Department. The uptick came as refinery utilization rates rose 0.3 percentage point to 89.5 percent of capacity and demand remained well below year-ago levels. Gasoline demand over the past four weeks averaged 9.35 million bpd, down 2.1 percent from a year ago. Overall product demand over the same period was running at 20.30 million bpd, down 2.0 percent from a year ago, according to the data. U.S. drivers have been hitting the brakes on road travel due to soaring costs at the pumps. (Reporting by  Richard Valdmanis ; Editing by John Picinich)
