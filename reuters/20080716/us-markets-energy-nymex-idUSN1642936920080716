 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil futures fell sharply for the second straight session Wednesday, weighed down by weekly government inventory data showing surprise increases in crude and gasoline stocks last week. 

 The dollar extended gains against the euro and yen, keeping crude futures under pressure. On the New York Mercantile Exchange at 11:15 a.m. EDT (1515 GMT), August crude was down $5.11 or 3.68 percent at $133.63 a barrel, trading from $132 which was the lowest since June 25 to $139.30. NYMEX crude hit a record $147.27 last Friday. On Tuesday, the contract fell $6.44 which marked the biggest fall in dollar terms since prices dropped $10.56 on January 17, 1991. "The (EIA) numbers looked bearish across the board with both crude and product stocks increasing much more than expected," said Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch & Associates in Galena, Illinois. In London on Wednesday, expiring August Brent crude was down $4.30 or 3.1 percent at $13445 a barrel, trading $132.50 to $139.26. The U.S. Energy Information Administration said that for the week to July 11, crude oil stocks rose 3.0 million barrels to 296.9 million barrels after two consecutive weeks of drawdowns. Analysts in a Reuters poll had predicted a 2.1 million barrel drawdown, on average. Imports rose sharply, by 1.2 million barrels per day to 10.8 million bpd while refinery utilization was up slightly. Gasoline stocks gained 2.4 million barrels to 214.2 million barrels, against the forecast for a 400,000 barrel decline. As expected, distillate stocks rose, but at a greater 3.2 million barrels to 125.7 million barrels, increasing for the 10th consecutive week. Forecasts had on average been for a 2.0 million barrel build. Demand for gasoline was flat at 9.3 million bpd while demand for distillates slipped to 4.1 million bpd from 4.3 million bpd the week before. August RBOB slumped 12.55 cents or 3.71 percent to $3.2593 a gallon, trading from $3.2158 to $3.3995. RBOB hit a NYMEX record $3.6310 on Friday. August heating oil was down 10.42 cents or 2.66 percent at $3.8148 a gallon, trading from $3.7603 to $3.9491. It likewise hit a record $4.1586 on Friday. The heating oil crack spread was at $26.59 after ending Tuesday at $25.85. The RBOB crack spread was at $3.36 after ending Tuesday at $3.42. The dollar extended gains on Wednesday against the euro and yen after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke told a House of Representatives panel that currency intervention may be warranted under certain conditions. On Tuesday, Bernanke had sparked a sharp fall in U.S. equities and energy markets sold off after he spelled out economic risks facing the United States. Meanwhile, Iran's highest authority said Tehran would retain its disputed nuclear work, speaking ahead of a meeting of world powers to be attended by the U.S., in a policy shift.
