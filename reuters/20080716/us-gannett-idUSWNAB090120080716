 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Gannett Co Inc ( GCI.N ), the largest U.S. newspaper publisher, posted a 36 percent drop in quarterly profit on Wednesday because of a decline in print advertising sales, and said it plans to take a non-cash writedown that could be as high as $2.9 billion. 

 Its shares tumbled 15 percent in early trading. Gannett also reported a 16 percent drop in publishing advertising revenue for the month of June, with classified ad sales down 21.6 percent. "The June numbers were really terrible, and that suggests maybe a bad start to the third quarter," said Benchmark Co analyst Edward Atorino. Gannett is the first of the publicly traded U.S. newspaper companies to report financial results this quarter. The decline in print advertising sales is likely to show up in other publishers such as Media General Inc ( MEG.N ), which is expected to report its results on Thursday. The story for most publishers is the same: Print revenue, which accounts for most of the money they make, is waning as advertisers chase readers online. Newsprint and other costs are rising, and larger economic woes sap advertising budgets in states hit by the real estate bust. Classified ads, meanwhile, show up for free on sites like Craigslist.org. Gannett, which publishes USA Today, the largest U.S. newspaper by circulation, said second-quarter preliminary net income fell to $232.7 million, or $1.02 a share, from $365.7 million, or $1.56 a share, a year earlier. Not counting severance expenses and other items, Gannett's profit was $1.01 a share, a penny short of analysts' average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters Estimates. Revenue fell 10 percent to $1.72 billion. The non-cash writedown for its newspapers and other assets could range from $2.6 billion to $2.9 billion before taxes, and from $2.4 billion to $2.7 billion after taxes. "The weakening economy had a dramatic impact on our results," Gannett Chief Executive Craig Dubow said in a statement. "The impairment charges reflect, in part, these challenging economic conditions and pressure on our stock price, but do not affect our ability to manage our businesses or make strategic acquisitions." Advertising revenue at its publishing division fell 13 percent to $1.11 billion. Retail ad revenue fell 8.3 percent, and classified ad revenue fell 18.7 percent. At USA Today, ad revenue fell 16.6 percent, and the number of paid advertising pages fell 20 percent. U.S. ad revenue fell 13.6 percent, while British ad revenue fell 12.5 percent in pounds sterling. Broadcasting revenue fell 6 percent to $192.6 million. Gannett's shares have lost more than two-thirds of their value in the past year as investors flee the newspaper business because of declining revenue and the migration of readers to the Internet, an area that publishers are touting for its growth potential. The problem is that publishers have not been able to rely on their Internet operations to compensate for what they have lost in print. Gannett shares were down $1.64 to $15.71 on the New York Stock Exchange after falling as low as $14.62 earlier. (Editing by John Wallace)
