 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Online auctioneer eBay Inc ( EBAY.O ) on Wednesday posted a 22 percent rise in quarterly profit, edging above Wall Street estimates, helped by a surge in new listings and share repurchases by the company. 

 The company gave a third-quarter outlook that was slightly below what analysts have been expecting, but said its full-year forecast would be within the range of Wall Street's forecasts. Second-quarter net income rose to $460 million, or 35 cents per share, from $376 million, or 27 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 20 percent to $2.2 billion. The company said it bought back 19 million eBay shares worth $566 million in the quarter, helping to boost reported earnings. Excluding stock option expenses and merger-related costs, eBay posted earnings of 43 cents per share, 2 cents above what analysts, on average, had expected, according to Reuters Estimates. Wall Street had been expecting revenue of $2.17 billion. (Reporting by  Alexandria Sage ; Editing by  Braden Reddall )
