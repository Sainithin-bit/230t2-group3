 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co ( WFC.N ) expects to add market share and pursue small acquisitions as a soft housing market and tight credit environment weigh down weakened rivals, Chief Financial Officer Howard Atkins said on Wednesday. 

 "We're really kind of standing out from the pack in terms of not only being able to grow this organization, but to take advantage of opportunities being created by the credit crisis itself," Atkins said in a telephone interview. "The credit crisis is giving us plenty of opportunities." Atkins said the bank is adding market share in such areas as retail mortgages, middle-market commercial lending and mutual funds and other asset management. He downplayed speculation the nation's fifth-largest bank and second-largest mortgage lender might acquire a large rival whose share price is beaten down. Atkins declined comment on whether San Francisco-based Wells Fargo might buy Wachovia Corp WB.N, the fourth-largest bank. Earlier on Wednesday, Wells Fargo said second-quarter profit declined 23 percent to $1.75 billion, or 53 cents per share, topping the average analyst forecast of 49 cents per share. The bank said revenue rose 16 percent to $11.5 billion, topping the average $10.7 billion forecast, while noninterest expense rose just 2 percent as incentive pay declined and the bank cut travel and entertainment expenses. It also raised its dividend 10 percent. Wells Fargo has avoided the hefty capital raises and dividend cuts plaguing many rivals, including Wachovia, Citigroup Inc ( C.N ) and Washington Mutual Inc ( WM.N ). Atkins said Wells Fargo is still interested in pursuing smaller acquisitions in its "footprint," largely the western two-thirds of the United States, where the bank can generate a 15 percent annual rate of return. He cited as an example the bank's acquisition this year of United Bancorp of Wyoming Inc, making Wells Fargo the largest bank in that state. "When you start getting into bigger, more complex, troubled organizations, prices may look very low, but the risks of doing those transactions are very high, so you have to be careful," Atkins said. He called out-of-market acquisitions "not high on the priority list of what we want to do." ADDING DEPOSITS Atkins also said Wells Fargo will likely pick up depositors who move cash out of the failed Pasadena, California lender IndyMac Bancorp Inc IDMC.PK. He said "it probably doesn't make a lot of sense" for the bank to buy IndyMac's loan portfolio, which includes many types of home loans that Wells Fargo rarely or does not offer. Wachovia stumbled with a $24.2 billion acquisition in 2006 of Golden West Financial Corp, an Oakland, California-based specialist in option adjustable-rate mortgages. Defaults have soared and Wachovia has discontinued the option ARM product. Atkins defended Wells Fargo's new policy of writing off home equity loans where payments were more than 180 days late, rather than 120. The bank said this resulted in the deferring of $265 million of charge-offs in the quarter. "It gave us and our customers a little more time to work with each other to keep customers in their homes," he said. "We felt that 120 days was just too tight a time frame." While declining to say when the housing market will bottom out, Atkins said there will be more downward pressure, although some markets such as Texas are relatively stable. "Housing has not bottomed yet, but is a lot closer to the bottom than it was nine months ago," he said. "The best assumption is, we're probably going to remain soft and probably go down for a period of time." (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn and  Andre Grenon )
