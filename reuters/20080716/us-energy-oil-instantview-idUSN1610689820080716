 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks of crude oil and refined products rose last week, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. 

 Crude stocks rose 3.0 million barrels last week, against analyst expectations of a 2.1 million barrel draw. Gasoline stocks rose unexpectedly by 2.4 million barrels while distillate stocks by 3.2 million barrels, much more than the 2 million barrels analysts forecasts. Oil futures prices fell sharply after the report. HIGHLIGHTS FROM EIA REPORT (In million barrels): - Crude +3.0 (forecast -2.1) - Distillate +3.2 (forecast +2.0) - Gasoline +2.4 (forecast -0.4) ANALYST COMMENTS: JOHN KILDUFF, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, MF GLOBAL, NEW YORK: "The EIA builds across the board are the most bearish inventory data we've seen in a long while." PHIL FLYNN, ANALYST, ALARON TRADING, CHICAGO: "Imports bounced up big and psychologically, this indicates more willingness on the part of refiners to take possession of more crude. They've been reluctant in the recent weeks to store more crude because of the high price of crude. With the higher imports, this takes away some concerns over supply." ROB KURZATKOWSKI, OPTIONSEXPRESS, CHICAGO, ILL "Refineries ran at a higher pace. Gasoline was up 2.4 million barrels and demand was still weak. Some of the diesel exports slowed a bit. The only positive bulls can draw on is the half million barrel decrease at Cushing. Every other component is pretty bearish." JIM RITTERBUSCH, PRESIDENT, RITTERBUSCH & ASSOCIATES,  GALENA, ILLINOIS "The numbers looked bearish across the board with both crude and product stocks increasing much more than expected. "Refinery activity also increased as recent margin deterioration is not yet translating to broad based run cuts. The fact that the west coast region accounted for less than 10 percent of the crude stock increase is also a bearish consideration to this report. "Although Cushing crude stocks dropped by 500,000 barrels back to below the pivotal 20 million barrel level, impact on the crude curve will be dampened by today's heavy selling. Demand numbers still look bearish with both gasoline and total product supplied off about 2 percent on a 4-week average basis." RACHEL ZIEMBA, ANALYST FOR RGE MONITOR IN NEW YORK "This is the first week in a while we've seen crude rise. But the more interesting side is the products -- we're seeing a significant drop in demand for both jet and gasoline. Gasoline stocks are starting to build. We're starting to see some of the demand destruction that people have been anticipating." AMANDA KURZENDOERFER, COMMODITIES ANALYST, SUMMIT ENERGY,  LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY "Nice build, so we're just seeing follow-through from that. Gasoline up more than anticipated, distillate up as well, ...An all around bearish report. "As far as percent changes, gasoline is down the most. That makes sense because gasoline is the most well-supplied market right now. "Crude inventories are low right now so we're going to need to see some more building from crude for the market to get comfortable with the inventory level... $130 (per barrel) is going to be a key level."
