 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares in Time Warner Inc ( TWX.N ) rose 4.7 percent on Wednesday after Reuters reported that talks to sell its AOL Internet unit to Yahoo Inc ( YHOO.O ) or Microsoft Corp ( MSFT.O ) have heated up ahead of Yahoo's August 1 shareholders meeting. 

 Time Warner shares increased 67 cents to $14.59 on the New York Stock Exchange, while Yahoo was up 95 cents to $22.49, and Microsoft jumped 99 cents to $27.14, both on Nasdaq. Though a structure of any potential deal is not immediately clear, sources told Reuters earlier that a deal with Yahoo would likely involve merging AOL with Yahoo, with Time Warner taking a minority stake in the combined company. The sources told Reuters that a deal with Microsoft would likely involve a sale of AOL. Time Warner's talks come after Microsoft's buyout talks with Yahoo fell apart, with Microsoft withdrawing its $47.5 billion bid in May. (Reporting by  Yinka Adegoke ; editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)
