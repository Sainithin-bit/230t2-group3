 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - CIT Group Inc ( CIT.N ) is in talks with overseas banks to find a steady stream of cheap funding to finance its core lending business, the Wall Street Journal said in its Monday edition, citing a person familiar with the matter. 

 Last week, the New York-based commercial finance company tapped an entire $7.3 billion credit line in an emergency action to help continue day-to-day operations and pay off debt. CIT executives said the company should have enough cash to operate for the rest of the year, but planned more asset sales. CIT did not immediately return a call seeking comment. The company is one of many finance companies to struggle in the deepening U.S. credit crunch. Chief Executive Jeffrey Peek has been scaling back CIT's exposure to consumer lending businesses. The company has about $90 billion of assets, more than $9 billion of which is in subprime mortgages. Shares of CIT closed Thursday at $9.63 on the New York Stock Exchange. They fell 37 percent last week, and are down 60 percent this year. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel; Editing by  Tomasz Janowski )
