 DHAKA  (Reuters) - Bangladesh's privately-owned GMG Airlines expects to complete a deal with plane maker Boeing ( BA.N ) to buy six new aircraft worth more than $900 million in the next few months, GMG's chairman said on Monday. 

 Boeing had offered to supply three 777-300ER and three 787-9 Dreamliners to GMG, from 2012 to 2017. "We have decided to accept the offer and hope a final agreement will be signed by the end of June or early July," Abdus Sattar, chairman of GMG Airlines, told Reuters. Boeing also recently won a $1.265 billion deal to supply eight aircraft to the national carrier Biman Bangladesh Airlines Ltd, GMG Airlines started its international operations in 2004 and currently flies from Dhaka to Kolkata, Delhi, Kathmandu, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur and Dubai with a fleet of seven aircraft. It started domestic operations in 1998 and is one of five Bangladeshi carriers competing for an increasing number of domestic and regional travelers. Bangladesh and India have recently agreed to increase flight frequencies between the two countries. (Reporting by Masud Karim, Writing by Nizam Ahmed; Editing by  Lincoln Feast )
