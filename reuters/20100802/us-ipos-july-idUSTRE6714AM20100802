 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Proceeds from initial public offerings in July soared on a global basis, hitting their highest level since before the 2008 financial meltdown, according to Thomson Reuters data. 

 The $30.5 billion that new issues raised globally in July was the most since November 2007 and exceeded the amount raised by follow-on issues for the month. Follow-ons, which were led by Mizuho Financial Group Inc ( 8411.T ) and INPEX Corp ( 1605.T ) in Japan, raised a total of $30.4 billion in July. That was a turnaround from 2009, when IPOs for the most part were dwarfed by secondary offerings, many of them by banks under pressure from regulators to raise capital. Year-to-date fees from the new issues, buoyed by Agricultural Bank of China's ( 1288.HK ) $20.8 billion IPO and the UK's $1.04 billion Vallar Plc VAAR.L IPO, reached $3.7 billion. That is more than five times the $706 million of fees banks reaped in the first seven months of 2009. Including IPOs, follow-ons and convertibles, the No. 1 ranked underwriting bank, year to date on a global basis, is JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ). JPMorgan has underwritten 185 deals worth $35.32 billion. Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ) is in the No. 2 position with 128 deals worth $31.03 billion, and Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) is No. 3, with 143 deals worth $25.49 billion.
