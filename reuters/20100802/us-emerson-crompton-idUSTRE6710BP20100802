 NEW DELHI  (Reuters) - Indian power equipment maker Crompton Greaves ( CROM.BO ) has offered $400 million for the transformer division of U.S.-based Emerson Electric Company ( EMR.N ), India's Business Standard reported, citing three unnamed investment bankers familiar with the development. 

 If successful, the acquisition would be Crompton's second in the United States after the Indian firm acquired MSE Power System for $16 million in 2008, the newspaper reported. The paper said Crompton did not respond to an email seeking a comment. (For the newspaper story, see  www.business-standard.com ) (Reporting by  Devidutta Tripathy ; Editing by Dhara Ranasinghe)
