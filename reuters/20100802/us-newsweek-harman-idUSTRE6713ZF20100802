 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Washington Post Co will sell Newsweek to audio equipment magnate Sidney Harman, nearly 50 years after the publisher bought the well-known U.S. weekly news magazine. 

 Sidney Harman, the 91-year-old founder of Harman International Industries Inc, won the money-losing newsweekly after an auction that included bidders Fred Drasner, the former publisher of the New York Daily News, and OpenGate Capital, owner of TV Guide. "In seeking a buyer for Newsweek, we wanted someone who feels as strongly as we do about the importance of quality journalism," Donald Graham, chief executive of the Washington Post Co, said in a statement on Monday. Terms of the deal were not disclosed but the Washington Post Co said it is retaining the pension assets, liabilities and certain employee obligations. Harman has pledged to keep most of Newsweek staff and plans to reshape the magazine into one with deep investigative and enterprise reporting, according to a source close to Harman. When the Washington Post put Newsweek up for auction, it said that any employee in good standing dismissed by the new owner would receive four months of severance pay. Newsweek has about 300 employees, representing almost $29 million in costs last year. The Washington Post Co put Newsweek on the block in May after sustaining several years of losses from the publication. Newsweek lost close to $11 million during the first quarter. The Post's decision to shed the venerable, but unprofitable, magazine is part of a course that Graham has pursued for several years. Best known for The Washington Post, its namesake newspaper, the company has been redefining itself as a media and education company, reflecting the contribution of its Kaplan educational test preparation services unit. Kaplan provides about 60 percent of the Post's revenue. Shares of Washington Post closed up 3.2 percent at $433.89 on the New York Stock Exchange.
