 TOKYO  (Reuters) - The dollar hit a three-month low against a basket of currencies on Monday, hurt by concerns that the recovery in the U.S. economy is slowing. 

 The dollar index, which measures the greenback's value against a basket of six major currencies, fell as low as 81.433 .DXY, its lowest since late April. (Reporting by Rika Otsuka)
