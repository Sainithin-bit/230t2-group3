 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Humana Inc ( HUM.N ) posted a 21 percent increase in quarterly profit on Monday, helped by growth in its Medicare plans for seniors, and the health insurer raised its full-year forecast. 

 One of the largest Medicare players, Humana also reported stronger performance in its commercial plans for employers. Humana's shares, which had been up as much as 4.5 percent earlier, gave back some of that gain by midday to trade at $48.44 up 3.0 percent. It was slightly outpacing shares of other large health insurers and a broad upswing in the market. U.S. health insurers have raised their outlooks after posting higher-than-expected profits during this reporting season, helped by generally lower use of medical services. But the market's reaction has been tempered by uncertainty over the fallout from the new U.S. healthcare reform law and questions about whether the companies could sustain their 2010 performance into next year. Like rivals, Humana did not provide a profit forecast for 2011, but the quarterly report showed that the "quality metrics look solid across the board," Collins Stewart analyst Brian Wright said. "There was some debate on the Street about earnings quality for some of the others," Wright said. Investors also have warmed to Humana as its dependence on Medicare, the U.S. government's health insurance for the elderly, has become more relatively appealing compared to those companies more exposed to the traditional commercial health insurance business. Humana's quarterly net income rose to $340.1 million, or $2.00 per share, compared with $281.8 million, or $1.67 per share, a year earlier. The company wrote down $147.5 million, or 55 cents per share, related to its assessment of its individual policy business in the wake of the new U.S. healthcare reform law, which is expected to bring substantial change to that business. Humana reported earnings of $2.11 per share excluding the write-down and excluding benefits from releasing claims reserves from prior periods. Analysts on average expected $1.67 per share, but it was not immediately clear if that figure was directly comparable to the results, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. But several analysts said the results amounted to a significant beat. "There are many moving pieces here, but this was a solid quarter, and underlying guidance is moving much higher," Citigroup analyst Carl McDonald said in a research note. Revenue rose 9.5 percent to $8.65 billion. Analysts had looked for about $8.61 billion. Humana's Medicare Advantage membership grew 17 percent to 1.76 million as of the end of June. Humana is one of the two biggest Medicare players, along with UnitedHealth Group Inc ( UNH.N ). Profit in Humana's commercial segment, excluding items, more than tripled to $115.2 million, as the company cited lower use of medical services, administrative cost savings and disciplined pricing for its plans. Humana projected a full-year profit of $5.65 to $5.75 per share, up from its prior range of $5.55 to $5.65. Analysts have been looking for $5.71. Excluding the write-down and other charges, Humana's operating earnings forecast is about $6.40 per share, McDonald said. Through Friday, Humana shares had risen about 7 percent this year, against a roughly 7 percent decline for the S&P Managed Healthcare index .GSPHMO.
