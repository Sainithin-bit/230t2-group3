 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc ( CSCO.O ) reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit and outlook on Tuesday citing strong demand from telecoms carriers for advanced network equipment, sending its shares up 5 percent. 

 Cisco, which makes routers, switches and other network equipment, also raised its target for long-term revenue growth, citing growing demand for online video and other services that require faster Internet speeds. Chief Executive John Chambers dismissed market concerns that Cisco could be hurt by slower U.S. economic growth. "I know there have been a number of mixed views about the strength of the U.S. IT spending, especially in large accounts. I am very pleased to share with you not only that our U.S. business was very strong, but the balance was good across all customer segments," he told analysts on a conference call. Cisco's fiscal fourth-quarter profit rose to $1.9 billion, or 31 cents per share, from $1.5 billion, or 25 cents per share, in the same period a year earlier. Earnings excluding items were 36 cents a share, beating the average analyst estimate by a penny, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue also topped market expectations. Cisco shares rose 5.8 percent in after-hours trading to $31.40, after closing at $29.69 on the Nasdaq. The stock has risen by more than 70 percent from a year earlier despite concerns about the U.S. economy, as both communications service providers upgraded their networks to handle growing Internet traffic. "When things are going well, as they are right now, they have enough flexibility that they can beat on a regular basis," said J.P. Morgan Securities analyst Ehud Gelblum. "Gross margin was 65 percent. The guidance is usually 64 to 65 percent. It's certainly on the good side." Quarterly revenue rose 18 percent to $9.4 billion, topping both the average Wall Street forecast of $9.275 billion and Chambers' own estimate in May of revenue growth in a range of 15 percent to 16 percent. On the conference call, Chambers gave first-quarter and full-year revenue forecasts that beat market expectations. He saw first-quarter revenue growing about 16 percent year-on-year to $9.45 billion to $9.55 billion, and forecast full-year growth of 13 percent to 16 percent. Analysts were looking for first-quarter revenue of $9.38 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. They had also forecast fiscal 2008 revenue at $39.7 billion, or 13.6 percent growth. Chambers also raised Cisco's long-term revenue growth target to between 12 percent and 17 percent year-on-year, from a previous range of 10 percent to 15 percent. THE NEXT WAVE Cisco said routing revenue in the fourth quarter rose 14 percent year-on-year, while switching revenue grew 18 percent. "Video continues to drive network demand and is potentially the killer application," Chambers said. He also said Cisco's growth was based on its expansion into newer businesses, as well as a broader geographic reach. The company has particularly focused on "unified communications," which are systems that integrate various services including wired and wireless phones, Web-based phone services, e-mail, instant messaging and Web conferencing. That falls into Cisco's advanced technology business category, which also includes network security and storage. Revenues in this category rose 24 percent, the company said. Cisco has also been expanding into consumer entertainment, as seen in its acquisition last year of cable set-top box maker Scientific-Atlanta. Quarterly revenue from Scientific-Atlanta grew by more than 30 percent from a year earlier, it said. Cisco said orders growth in emerging markets approached 50 percent in the fourth quarter. Orders from Japan, however, were flat, and Chambers said there appeared to be a delay in an expected build-out of a next-generation network. Analysts have said the planned project could bring Cisco more business. U.S. order growth was in the upper teens, with service provider orders up nearly 30 percent year-on-year. Orders from its enterprise, or corporate, segment rose 12 percent. Greg Woodard, portfolio strategist at Manning & Napier Advisors Inc., said enterprise appeared to be Cisco's only weakness. "This is the key to driving top-line and bottom-line growth going forward," he said. (Additional reporting by Cal Mankowski,  Gina Keating  in Los Angeles and  Duncan Martell  in San Francisco)
