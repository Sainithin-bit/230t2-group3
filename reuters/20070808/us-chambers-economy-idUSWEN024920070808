 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc. ( CSCO.O ) Chief Executive Officer John Chambers said the global economy is the strongest he's seen, even as he expects bumps in the U.S. economy in the next few quarters during a CNBC television interview. 

 "It's the strongest global economy I've seen in my career," said Chambers, citing Asia, emerging markets and Europe, with growth in 23 of Cisco's top 30 countries above 15 percent. Asked about the U.S. economy, Chambers said he expects some bumps in the next few quarters. "We plan three to five years out. I view the next quarter or two as maybe a little bumpy, but the long term outlook from our customers is very solid," he said. (Reporting by  Sinead Carew )
