 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President George W. Bush said on Wednesday that, despite the problems in the mortgage lending market, there was no need for new laws and that current laws should be enforced. 

 "I think we ought to crack down on predatory lending. I don't think we need new law, we ought to enforce the law on the books," Bush said in an interview with Fox News Channel. "And then I think we ought to let the market work." (Reporting by  Tabassum Zakaria )
