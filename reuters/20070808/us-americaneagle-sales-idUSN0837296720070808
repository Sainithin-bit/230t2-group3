 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - American Eagle Outfitters Inc. ( AEO.N ) posted a surprising 6 percent decline in July sales at stores open at least a year on Wednesday, but reaffirmed its second-quarter profit outlook. 

 Analysts, on average, had expected the teen clothing retailer to post a same-store sales increase of 3 percent, according to Reuters Estimates, though estimates ranged from a drop of 1 percent to a gain of 8 percent. Total sales for the seller of casual preppy fashions rose 19 percent to $233.9 million. American Eagle said later back-to-school starting dates around the United States, as well as Florida and Texas shifting tax-free sales days from July to August hurt store traffic. But customers have been responding well to its fall back-to-school collection, the company said in a statement. August and September are more crucial months for teen retailers than July, as more students beef up their wardrobes during these two months. Also on Wednesday, smaller rival Hot Topic Inc HOTT.O said the shift in tax-free sales days to August hurt its results. Same-store sales at Hot Topic fell 7.4 percent during July, with 3 percent of that decline attributed to the tax-free days shift, the company said. But the seller of rock 'n' roll inspired apparel and accessories made no mention of any negative influence from later back-to-school start dates. OUTLOOK INTACT American Eagle's same-store monthly sales decline marked the second one this year for the high-flying teen retailer. April same-store sales fell 10 percent, due to more Easter shopping occurring in March. But despite the missed result, the company was able to match the high end of its first-quarter earnings outlook when it reported earnings in May. The retailer forecast second-quarter earnings per share of 35 cents to 36 cents. Analysts, on average, are expecting American Eagle to post second-quarter earnings of 36 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Shares of American Eagle closed down 46 cents at $23.84 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by  Alexandria Sage , editing by Andre Grenon/Jeffrey Benkoe)
