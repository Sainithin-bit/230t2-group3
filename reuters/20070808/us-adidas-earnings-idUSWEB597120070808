 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Second-quarter net income rose sharply at Adidas ADSG.DE, Europe's biggest sports-goods maker, as the integration of its Reebok division helped cut costs and increase margins despite nearly flat sales growth. 

 Sales fell in North America but grew in all other markets in the first half, Adidas said on Wednesday, adding the European soccer championship and Olympic Games in 2008 would boost revenue and earnings this year and next. Shares of Adidas rose as much as 4.8 percent and by 1124 GMT were up 1.7 percent at 43.83 euros, outperforming a 0.6 percent increase on Germany's blue-chip DAX index  .GDAXI . Adidas said second-quarter net income rose 27 percent to 104 million euros ($144 million), above the average forecast of 96 million euros in a Reuters poll of 15 analysts. In euro terms, sales fell 1 percent to 2.4 billion euros, narrowly beating an average forecast of 2.377 billion euros. The company credited its higher margins -- gross margin increased 2.8 percentage points to 47.4 percent -- to cost cuts and synergies from integrating Reebok, which it bought in 2005. On a currency-adjusted basis, sales rose 3 percent, despite tough comparisons with the prior year when sales were high because of the soccer World Cup in Germany. The company's Adidas and Reebok footwear brands have lost shelf space at U.S. mall-based retail chains and have lost market share in the top five European footwear markets, primarily to rival Nike ( NKE.N ), analysts say. Adidas, known for its three-stripes logo, said the order backlog -- a key indication of retailers' future sales -- for the Adidas brand rose 6 percent on a euro currency basis. At Reebok the order backlog expressed in euros fell 3 percent year-on-year at the end of June. On a currency-neutral basis, Reebok's order backlog was flat. Reebok footwear has come under pressure in the United States for the past few quarters because of problems at retailer Foot Locker Inc ( FL.N ), which is shutting hundreds of shops and is not ordering many new goods. Adidas Chief Financial Officer Robin Stalker said he sees the pressures in the United States continuing for the next two to three quarters, adding that without the problems at Foot Locker, Reebok's order backlog in the United States would have been positive at the end of the second quarter. Herbert Hainer, the chief executive of Adidas, said: "Reebok is making progress and becoming stronger." Some analysts agree. "In light of the bunch of profit warnings we got in U.S. retail, Reebok's flat orders should be a relief," said Joerg Frey at Sal Oppenheim. However, Merck Finck said in a report that order backlogs at Adidas "showed a mixed picture...adidas could not match Nike's performance. Orders in Europe and Asia were good (at Adidas) but below Nike's shown growth rate." Nike's total order backlog stood 11 percent higher at the end of June, Merck Finck said. Adidas bought Reebok to complement its strength in classic sportswear and its strong position in Europe with Reebok's focus on the U.S. market and lifestyle fashion, a segment tapped successfully by German rival Puma ( PUMG.DE ). Signs that Reebok's integration is paying off emerged in the first quarter, when order backlog rose 3 percent on a currency neutral basis, the first rise since the takeover. Adidas reiterated that it expects currency-neutral sales to grow by a mid-single-digit percentage in 2007 and the rise in net income to approach about 15 percent.
