 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - Dutch financial services group ING Groep NV reported a 27 percent rise in quarterly net profit on Wednesday, helped by a gain on the sale of shares in ABN AMRO and strong insurance results. 

 Net income in the second quarter rose to 2.56 billion euros ($3.53 billion) from 2 billion euros a year earlier. Underlying net profit rose 8.2 percent to 2.17 billion euros, excluding a 573 million-euro gain on the sale of part of ING's stake in ABN AMRO and a charge of 188 million euros for integrating its Postbank operations with ING Bank in the Netherlands, ING said. On that basis, the average forecast of 10 analysts for quarterly net profit was 1.89 billion euros. "The underlying net profit was better than expected and it is clear that all its growth drivers are back to growth again," said Rabo Securities analyst Cor Kluis in a client note. ING shares jumped at the start of trade and were among the highest gainers in Amsterdam, trading up 4.55 percent at 32.16 euros at 0715 GMT. Asked why ING sold ABN AMRO shares, ING Chief Executive Michel Tilmant told reporters: "We had a large position on ABN AMRO and felt there were a number of uncertainties ... viewed in the overall context of the portfolio, we decided to sell." ABN is facing competing multi-billion-euro bids from Barclays and a consortium led by Royal Bank of Scotland. ING, which had held discussions about a potential merger with ABN, owned more than 5 percent of its Dutch rival and regulatory filings indicate ING still owns about 2 percent. Tilmant ruled out that ING would re-enter merger discussions with ABN. SOLID UNDERLYING BUSINESSES Even adjusting for one-off gains and charges, ING posted solid returns in banking and insurance. The banking division's underlying profit before tax fell 0.5 percent to 1.33 billion euros, as tighter interest rate margins and higher provisions for bad loans offset mortgage sales and deposit growth. Insurance performed well, boosted by strong sales in Europe and the United States, as well as gains from equity and real estate, and underlying profit before tax rose 49.8 percent to 1.97 billion euros. Tilmant said while credit markets have "recently become more turbulent," he expected no significant impact on ING's earnings for 2007. ING said it had 3.2 billion euros in exposure to subprime mortgages through asset-backed securities, or 0.25 percent of ING's total assets. ING said it wrote down these assets at the end of July by 58 million euros. ING has been buying back shares and made two acquisitions recently, Turkey's Oyak Bank and Santander's Latin American pension operations, but its share price has lagged its closest rivals in Europe. Although ING's model of relying on a diversified stream of income from insurance and banking has helped it post solid earnings growth, analysts say opportunities for faster growth are limited unless it embarks on a major merger or expansion effort. Its shares have fallen 8.2 percent in the past 12 months, while the DJ Stoxx insurance index is up 8 percent. The sector trades at about 9 times projected 2007 earnings, while ING is at a slight discount at 8.7 times.
