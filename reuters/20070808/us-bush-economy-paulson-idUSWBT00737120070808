 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. economic fundamentals are sound, although it will take time to work through a housing market correction, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said on Wednesday. 

 "The fundamentals of the economy are very solid," Paulson said in an interview with CNBC. "The markets have been unsettled ... largely because of disruptions in the subprime space. Risk is being re-priced." Paulson, who met with President George W. Bush and his team of economic advisers earlier on Wednesday, said the United States had been through "periods of excess" and it would take time to work through that, but the underlying economy was quite healthy. Paulson also said China would like to increase its investment in the United States, and dismissed a report that China had considered liquidating its vast U.S. Treasury holdings if Washington imposed trade sanctions. "I think it's absurd, frankly," Paulson said, pointing out that he had just returned from a visit to China, where he met with top-level government officials. "They're focused on the same thing any investor is focused on: the best risk-adjusted rate of return," he said. "The Chinese are the second-largest holder of U.S. Treasuries but what the Chinese hold in Treasuries is less than one day's trading volume in Treasuries. We have a broad, liquid market. If you've got a hundred things to worry about, I'd worry about that last."
