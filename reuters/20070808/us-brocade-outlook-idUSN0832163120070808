 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Data storage equipment maker Brocade Communications Systems Inc ( BRCD.O ) trimmed its revenue outlook but raised the lower bracket of its operating earnings forecast on Wednesday, sending its shares sharply higher. 

 Brocade's revised forecast comes a day after former chief executive Gregory Reyes was convicted on criminal charges relating to the backdating of stock options. It also comes after rival Network Appliance Inc. ( NTAP.O ) said last week its revenue fell more than its previous pessimistic forecast amid slower spending by large customers in the United States and Europe. Network Appliance's stock fell some 20 percent after the sales warning. "Given the negative sentiment on Brocade, and the overall storage space ... over the past several weeks, we believe Brocade's announcement that July '07 revenue would fall modestly below the company's prior guidance range while gross and operating margin remained intact, could actually support modest upside to the shares in the near term," AG Edwards analyst Aaron Rakers wrote in a Wednesday note to clients. Shares of Brocade were up 76 cents, or 12.3 percent, to $6.95 in afternoon trading on Nasdaq after trading as high as $7.09 earlier in the session. Reyes was convicted on Tuesday on all 10 counts in the government's first criminal trial involving stock options backdating, including conspiracy to commit securities fraud; mail fraud; falsifying books, records and accounts; and making false statements. The 44-year-old could face decades in jail and millions of dollars in fines. Legal experts said that the conviction could embolden prosecutors and regulators in their pursuit of similar cases. More than 170 U.S. companies have been touched by the scandal. In May, Brocade agreed to pay a $7 million penalty to settle charges of fraudulent stock option backdating. VALUE INVESTORS COULD STEP UP For the third quarter, Brocade, which makes switches and software that connect server computers and data storage gear, said it now sees a profit before items of 11 to 12 cents per share, compared with its earlier forecast of 10 to 12 cents. "Brocade's shares have already come down by 24.6 percent this year," wrote Goldman Sachs analyst Laura Conigliaro, noting that they have underperformed the Goldman Sachs Technology Index by 24 percent. That stock price decline has "already discounted its more difficult competitive position" relative to data networking kingpin Cisco Systems Inc. ( CSCO.O ), which has beefed up its storage offerings in recent years, said Conigliaro. "A revenue re-set could be just the catalyst to get more value-oriented investors to step up," she wrote. Analysts on average currently expect Brocade to post a profit of 11 cents per share, excluding items, on revenue of $337.0 million, according to Reuters Estimates. Brocade cut its revenue forecast to $325 million to $327 million, compared with an earlier view of $330 million to $340 million. Brocade said it expects third-quarter net earnings of 2 to 3 cents per share. million. The company had earlier forecast net earnings of 3 to 5 cents a share. It said it plans to report full financial results for its fiscal third quarter on August 23, after the close of trading. Brocade Chief Executive Michael Klayko said in a statement he believes the company maintained its competitive position across its product lines and is optimistic as the San Jose, California-based company enters a seasonally stronger quarter than the one it just completed. Rakers wrote that Brocade has been targeting an operating profit margin before items of 15 to 20 percent; and according to his estimates, Brocade had an operating profit margin before items of about 17 percent in the quarter ended in July.
