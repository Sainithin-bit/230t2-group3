 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. inflation has been well contained since the late 1980s and the public understands the benefits of this achievement, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis President Gary Stern said on Wednesday. 

 In a speech on the benefits of education, Stern made no reference to the current economy or outlook for monetary policy. "Inflation has now been reasonably well contained for roughly two decades or so, and the consensus in favor of price stability has been sustained," he said. Stern is not a voter this year on the Federal Reserve's policy-setting committee, which on Tuesday voted to hold interest rates steady at 5.25 percent. In the statement that accompanied the decision, the U.S. central bank acknowledged that financial markets had suffered recent turmoil and credit had tightened for some businesses and households. "I regret to note that today we are again witnessing some painful and belated learning, by policy-makers and consumers alike, in our consumer financial markets," Stern said, in an oblique reference to problems in the subprime mortgage market for borrowers with risky credit. "This is not the time to go into details of how the Federal Reserve and the other financial regulators are responding," he said. The Fed also said in its Tuesday statement that inflation remained a top concern, and Stern said there was broad support for this position. "The public continues to understand the long-term benefits of low inflation and thus to support the Federal Reserve's pursuit of this objective," he said.
