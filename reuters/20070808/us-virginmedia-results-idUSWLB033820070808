 LONDON  (Reuters) - British cable operator Virgin Media said an ongoing channel pricing row with BSkyB has cost it 40,000 customers, many of them higher-paying viewers taking combined broadband, phone and cable services. 

 The company said on Wednesday it lost a net 70,300 customers, reducing its total to 4.7 million, in the three months to the end of June. It lost a net 46,900 customers in the first quarter. The results come a day after Virgin Media extended the deadline for its self-auction due to debt market turbulence. The firm said on Tuesday suitors continued to show interest. Around 40,000 of the latest fall in subscribers came from customers leaving after BSkyB removed its basic Sky channels from Virgin's platform in March. Fixed-line telephone subscriber losses made up the rest. Second-quarter group revenue slipped to 995 million pounds ($2.02 billion) from 1.021 billion in the first quarter, but was higher than the 884 million pounds posted a year ago. Churn, or the percentage of customers who left the cable service, rose to 1.8 percent from 1.6 percent in the first quarter, while second-quarter gross disconnections jumped 31,000 to 262,200. The spat with Sky also saw average revenue per user slip to 42.16 pounds from 42.75 pence in the first quarter amid a fall in telephony usage and retention discounts. That latter figure was down from 42.82 pounds in the previous quarter. Had it not been for the Sky row, churn would have remained at 1.6 percent, Virgin Media said, adding it expected the fallout from the row to be "largely contained" in the second quarter. In a conference call with reporters Chief Operating Officer Neil Berkett said although the legal wrangle with Sky was ongoing, he was confident the business had stemmed the customer losses. "We have absolutely weathered that storm," he said. Berkett said he "would love to have Sky back" on the Virgin platform. However, as that wasn't likely any time soon, the business was pushing into new content offerings such as the sports packages delivered via the likes of Irish broadcaster Setanta to show football, golf, rugby, racing and motor sport. Virgin Media and Sky are locked in a legal wrangle, in which Virgin has accused Sky of abusing its dominant position in the market. Virgin stopped carrying several Sky channels after the two sides failed to agree on the fees Sky would pay. Citigroup analysts said in note that the fundamentals of the Virgin Media business remained challenging given the pressure seen in the customer base, revenue generated per user and average revenue per user during the second quarter. "However, with confirmed private equity interest, and the stock around 20 percent off its recent LBO-inspired highs, it remains a hold," Citigroup said. Virgin Media said its broadband customer numbers rose by 51,000 in the second quarter to 3.5 million and that its outlook for the rest of the year remained strong. The growth was down on the 87,900 net broadband subscribers added in the first quarter. The group, launched this year from the merger of NTL, Telewest and Virgin's mobile phone division, said on Wednesday it had 2,200 net new second-quarter additions to its TV service, while Virgin Mobile contract customers rose 53,000 to 299,000. Operating income before depreciation, amortization and other charges rose to 315.3 million pounds ($639.1 million) from 305.7 million last year. Shares in Virgin Media, which are listed on the Nasdaq in New York, closed down on Tuesday at $23.48, below where they were before the company put itself up for auction.
