 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Spectrum Brands Inc SPC.N is likely to sell its pet business, which makes products such as Tetra fish food, analysts said after the company disclosed it plans to sell a strategic asset by the end of 2007. 

 On Tuesday, Chief Executive Kent Hussey said Spectrum would bring "an attractive strategic asset" to market after the September 3 Labor Day holiday and did not say which asset it might be. "Although not outright stated, (Spectrum) discussed its decision to put the pet business up for sale in the next couple of weeks," SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Bill Chappell said in a research note. A spokeswoman for Spectrum declined on Wednesday to say what asset would be put up for sale. On Tuesday, Hussey said the company has enough liquidity to operate normally for the foreseeable future even without such a sale and its shares soared. Deutsche Bank analyst Bill Schmitz, in a note entitled "Gone Fishin'" also said the pet business is the one "likely on the auction block." He rates the company's shares "hold." Chappell said the pet category is an attractive one and that the business could fetch a $1 billion price tag. Spectrum, formerly known as Rayovac Corp. and well known for its Rayovac batteries, established itself in the aquatics market in 2005 when it bought Germany's Tetra Holding GmbH and a smaller company, Jungle Labs. Its other pet-related products include Dingo treats for dogs and Nature's Miracle stain and odor removal kits. Chappell, who rates Spectrum "buy," also said the company could now decide to keep the home and garden business it had been trying to sell since last year. Spectrum is still treating its home and garden unit as a business held for sale, as it has for months, but said on Tuesday it had not yet determined when that sale may occur. DEBT LOAD In July 2006, Spectrum said it hired Goldman Sachs to help it evaluate asset sales designed to sharpen its focus on growth businesses and reduce debt. The company had $2.65 billion in total debt at the end of the fiscal third quarter ended July 1, 2007, up from $2.28 billion a year earlier. AG Edwards analyst Jason Gere also expects the pet business will be the one up for sale in a few weeks. "Selling your fastest growth business is tough to swallow but it could fetch a much higher multiple today than Home & Garden could, and help reduce (Spectrum's) huge debt burden," Gere wrote. He rates the shares "hold." The aquatic category has faced some pressure since Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) stopped selling live fish at a few hundred U.S. stores earlier this year. But on Tuesday Hussey said Spectrum made a proposal to Wal-Mart to keep live fish in other stores. He said the retailer has a test planned based on that proposal, which addresses the operational issues of maintaining live fish. For now, he said, Wal-Mart has stopped taking live fish out of any additional stores. In the fiscal third quarter, pet unit sales inched up to $135 million from $132.3 million. Sales of products for companion animals such as dogs grew 9 percent and aquatics sales were flat. Profitability in the unit fell 18.6 percent to $14.4 million, due largely to transportation and warehousing costs as Spectrum worked on a business realignment. Shares of Spectrum were up 4.8 percent at $5.24 in late morning trading on Wednesday. The shares have rebounded from a low of $3.77 hit on Monday, a day before the quarterly results and sale plans were announced, but are still far from the high of $46.11 hit in 2005.
