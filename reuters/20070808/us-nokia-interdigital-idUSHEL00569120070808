 HELSINKI  (Reuters) - Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ), the world's top cell phone maker, said on Wednesday it would defend itself and its products against complaints Interdigital ( IDCC.O ) has filed in courts in the United States. 

 "Nokia intends to vigorously defend itself, its products, and its integrity in this matter and ensure that its rights are protected," Nokia spokeswoman said, adding that the company would not offer additional comments on the case yet, because it has not received copies of the complaints.
