 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Bankrupt auto parts maker Delphi Corp. DPHIQ.PK posted a narrower quarterly net loss on Wednesday amid charges for its reorganization and lawsuits stemming from financial restatements. 

 Delphi also said it was in talks to settle the lawsuits, which were filed after Delphi restated 1999 to 2004 financial results from its spin-off from General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) The cases were consolidated as multi-district litigation in federal court in Michigan. Delphi, which filed for bankruptcy in October 2005, has said it expects to file a reorganization plan in the third quarter and exit bankruptcy protection by the end of 2007. The net loss narrowed to $821 million, or $1.46 per share, in the second quarter, from $2.3 billion, or $4.05 per share, a year earlier, when it took charges for retirements and buyouts for U.S. hourly workers. Delphi took a $332 million charge in the second quarter for its current estimate of the company's liability from actions filed on behalf of employees whose pension plans invested in company stock. Insurance may cover some of the cost. The Troy, Michigan-based auto-parts maker also reported $301 million of restructuring costs, about two-thirds of that for exiting a manufacturing plant in Spain, and $39 million of asset impairment charges. Revenue was flat at $7 billion for the quarter, Delphi said. Revenue from customers other than GM, its biggest, rose 5 percent to $4.1 billion due to favorable foreign exchange rates.
