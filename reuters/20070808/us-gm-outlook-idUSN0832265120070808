 TRAVERSE CITY, Michigan  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) on Wednesday lowered its forecast for industry-wide U.S. sales in 2007 and said it would be "challenging" to achieve its target of selling 3 million vehicles at showrooms. 

 In a presentation prepared for securities analysts, GM Chief Financial Officer Fritz Henderson said the No. 1 U.S. automaker was now forecasting lower industry-wide sales after initially forecasting a flat year for the U.S. market. Henderson said in the prepared slides released on GM's Web site that the automaker remained on track to achieve its targeted $9-billion reduction in operating costs. (Reporting by  Kevin Krolicki )
