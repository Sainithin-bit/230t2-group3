 LONDON  (Reuters) - Senior management at music group Chrysalis CHS.L are keen to pursue a sale, but a major issue yet to be resolved is what direction founder, chairman and key stakeholder Chris Wright wants to take the business, sources familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. 

 Interest in Chrysalis has intensified in the wake of private equity firm Terra Firma's 2.4 billion pound ($4.87 billion) bid for EMI EMI.L, the world's third-largest music firm. Warner Music WMG.N is also considering the possibility of going private, according to a New York Post report on Wednesday that sent the company's shares up nearly 15 percent. The going-private discussion at Warner Music, home to artists such as Madonna and Kid Rock, "is understood to be in its infancy," that report said. Now the recent disposal by Chrysalis of its radio assets for 170 million pounds has analysts asking how much longer the considerably smaller British rival to EMI can stay independent. "Chrysalis Music is well placed to build upon and exploit its position as a leading international independent music business and that is our focus," Chrysalis Music CEO Jeremy Lascelles said on Wednesday. That independence could come via an appropriately structured bid or with Wright taking the business private, analysts said. "The balance of probability is edging more towards private rather than public status," said Bridgewell Securities analyst Patrick Yau. BUYERS IN THE WINGS Dresdner Kleinwort's Richard Menzies-Gow upgraded Chrysalis to buy from hold on Tuesday, saying there was little logic for Chrysalis' music business to stay public. "We believe there are numerous interested suitors ready to offer an attractive price for the business, more than is currently implied in the share price," said Menzies-Gow. Potential bidders cited by analysts include Sony/ATV, a joint venture between Sony ( 6758.T ) and Michael Jackson, Publicis ( PUBP.PA ) unit Universal Music -- the world's biggest music firm and private equity vehicles that focus on music publishing. However, with a 26 percent stake, Wright can influence any decision but his intentions remain unclear, Menzies-Gow said. Music industry sources said all major music publishers would be interested in looking at Chrysalis, but so far there were no signs that the company was seeking to solicit any offers. Chrysalis shares ended 9.3 percent higher at 127-1/2 pence, the second-best performance among London media stocks. The shares have risen 13 percent since July 30, the day shareholders approved the sale of the company's radio assets. With Wednesday's gains, Chrysalis has a market value of just over 210 million pounds. RICH ASSET POOL Analysts say the jewel in Chrysalis' crown is its music publishing assets. The company's catalogue has around 65,000 publishing copyrights and spans decades and genres. Blondie, Billy Idol, David Bowie and Jethro Tull feature among its singer/songwriters while current chart acts include Feeder, OutKast and Ray LaMontagne. Michael Jackson, Mariah Carey and Madonna rank among artists who have recorded material from Chrysalis songwriters. The company, whose artists also include Damon Albarn, owns classic masters by Tom Jones and Engelbert Humperdinck plus Beatles' producer royalties. Analysts think the music publishing business of Chrysalis alone could fetch around 180-200 million pounds following the sale of its radio assets to Global Radio, the private equity firm chaired by former ITV Chief Executive Charles Allen. "It seems clear to us that the remaining businesses are themselves prime take-private or consolidation candidates, a suspicion underlined by the scaling back of the corporate overhead over the next year and a half," said Bridgewell's Yau. Phil Riley, CEO of Chrysalis Radio, is expected to resign from the board once the radio disposal is completed. Group CEO Richard Huntingford and Finance Director Michael Connole are due to step down by the end of the year. Investor relations and a number of group functions are also going. Menzies-Gow thinks that with Lascelles and Finance Director Neil Fenton expected to step into respective group positions, it is unlikely there will be a sale of Chrysalis in the short term. Dresdner thinks and exit is more likely to be over the next two to four years, particularly as the company has paid down its group debt to just 20 million pounds.
