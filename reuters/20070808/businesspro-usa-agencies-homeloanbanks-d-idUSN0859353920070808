 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Federal Home Loan Banks of 
Chicago and Dallas announced on Wednesday that they have begun 
preliminary talks about a possible merger as both banks face 
challenges turning a profit. 

  "Our focus is on identifying whether and how a combination 
would produce advantageous results and improved value for 
members of both organizations and the affordable housing needs 
of their communities," said Terry Smith, president and CEO of 
Dallas, and Mike Thomas, president and CEO of Chicago.  The Federal Home Loan banks are government-sponsored 
enterprises that use private capital to finance U.S. housing 
and community development. The regional banks are held 
cooperatively by more than 8,000 lending institutions and enjoy 
a favored position in the capital markets because of their 
implied government backing.  In recent years, increased regulatory scrutiny and 
consolidation has squeezed Home Loan bank profits. In May 2006, 
for instance, the Dallas bank faced the loss of its largest 
member to a merger with Wachovia. The Chicago bank was forced 
to take costly remediation steps recently after a failed home 
loan program.  Ronald Rosenfeld, chairman of the regulatory Federal 
Housing Finance Board, had no comment Wednesday about the 
merger talks but has in the past supported the idea that some 
of the twelve regional banks could merge.  "Quite frankly, I'm not sure why you need six banks between 
Pittsburg and Topeka," Rosenfeld told a Congressional panel in 
September.
