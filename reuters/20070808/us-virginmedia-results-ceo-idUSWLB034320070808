 LONDON  (Reuters) - British cable operator Virgin Media VMED.O Chief Executive Steve Burch said on Wednesday he was confident the business had stemmed customer losses caused by a dispute with British satellite broadcaster BSkyB. 

 "We have absolutely weathered the storm," Burch told reporters in a conference call following the company's second-quarter results. Virgin Media said a decline of 40,000 cable customers was due to Sky's ( BSY.L ) having removed its basic channels from the Virgin platform on March 1. "Clearly, that is 40,000 customers I would have preferred not to have lost," Burch said, adding that the figure was well below the 100,000-plus drop a number of analysts had forecast. Burch also said that the decline in average revenue per user to 42.16 pounds from 42.75 pounds over the quarter was due to the loss of higher-paying triple-play customers during the row. Virgin Media and Sky remain locked in a legal wrangle, in which Virgin has accused Sky of abusing its dominant position in the market.
