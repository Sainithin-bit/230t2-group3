 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - McDonald's Corp. ( MCD.N ) on Wednesday said sales at restaurants open at least 13 months rose a better-than-expected 6.5 percent in July, helped by breakfast sales in both the United States and Asia. 

 Wall Street analysts, on average, had been expecting a rise of 4 percent, according to research notes. Same-store sales rose 4.3 percent in the United States, 7.7 percent in Europe and 9.9 percent in the company's Asia, Middle East and Africa unit. Breakfast "is more than 25 percent of U.S. sales and is the most profitable day part," said McDonald's spokeswoman Heidi Barker. Breakfast has also been a strong seller in China, where Western-style offerings have done well for the company in recent months. Extended restaurant hours also boosted sales in McDonald's Asia unit, with Japan, Australia and China showing particular strength. Sales in Europe were helped by a Mediterranean menu in Germany including an olive-topped burger and a shrimp-lemon burger, Barker said. Results in France and the United Kingdom were also strong, McDonald's said. "We continue to be impressed with the European turnaround, which should help drive (earnings) upside over the next year," UBS analyst David Palmer said in a client note. Palmer added that an upcoming investor trip to see McDonald's business in China, an update on the company's dividend and share buyback programs, and a November analyst day should help drive the company's stock up this fall. For the month, system-wide sales rose 11.7 percent. McDonald's shares were up 42 cents, or 0.9 percent, at $50.15 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock is up 12.9 percent so far this year, compared with a 9.1 percent increase for the Dow Jones Industrial Average  .DJI , of which McDonald's is a component. McDonald's shares traded at about 16.5 times next year's estimated earnings, compared with a multiple of 13.9 for the Dow. (Reporting by  Nichola Groom  and  Brad Dorfman )
