 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Best Buy Co Inc's ( BBY.N ) former Chairman Richard Schulze is not expected to present a buyout or other proposal to the company's board anytime soon, a person familiar with the situation said. 
 Media reports said Schulze was close to presenting an offer for the consumer electronics chain. Discussions around a leveraged buyout of the company are still in the early stages, the person said. A representative for Schulze and Best Buy declined to comment. (Reporting By  Nadia Damouni ; Editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
