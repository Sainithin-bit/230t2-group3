 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - General Motors ( GM.N ) on Monday said it would transfer the lions share of its logistics business in Europe to Gefco a unit run by French auto maker Peugeot ( PEUP.PA ) effective 2013. 
 Late last month week Opel Chief Executive Karl-Friedrich Stracke said the alliance between Opel's parent company General Motors ( GM.N ) and Peugeot would now also include a cooperation between Opel and Gefco, Peugeot's car delivery group. It is part of a broader alliance struck between GM and Peugeot in February, which the two companies hope will lead to at least $2 billion in annual savings from shared purchasing, logistics and the joint development and production of vehicles and parts.
