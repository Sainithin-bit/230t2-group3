 ABU DHABI  (Reuters) - U.S. defense major Raytheon ( RTN.N ) has won a $42.8 million contract to train Afghan air force pilots in the Middle East, its first such contract in the region, Raytheon's regional chief said on Sunday. 

 Kevin Massengill, Raytheon's vice president for Middle East and North Africa, said the company is also in discussions with Pakistan to train pilots. "We have signed the contract and will do the training in an Arab Gulf country," he told Reuters at a defense exhibition. He declined to name the country where the training will be held. The training program will be an "ongoing enterprise" and will go on for a couple of months, he said. (Reporting by Stanley Carvalho; Editing by Andrew Marshall)
