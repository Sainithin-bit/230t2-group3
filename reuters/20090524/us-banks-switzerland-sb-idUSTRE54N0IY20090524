 GENEVA  (Reuters) - Switzerland's banking authority has subjected banks in the country to a stress test to assess how they would withstand a shock to their loan books, Swiss weekly NZZ am Sonntag reported on Sunday. 

 It said the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority Finma had asked banks active in credit and mortgage business what would happen if 4 percent of their credits turned sour. The test also checked whether banks were matching maturities appropriately -- using short-term deposits only to fund short-term lending, it said. The paper estimated that if 4 percent of credits were lost, Swiss banks would have to build loan loss reserves of 50 billion Swiss francs ($46 billion). "Conducting crisis scenarios, or so-called stress tests, is one of the classic functions of a supervisory authority," it quoted Finma spokesman Alain Bichsel as saying. It said bankers expect the test will lead Finma to impose tougher capital requirements on banks. (Reporting by  Jonathan Lynn ; Editing by Dan Lalor) ($1 = 1.084 Swiss francs)
