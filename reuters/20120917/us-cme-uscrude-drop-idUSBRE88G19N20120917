 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - CME Group Inc ( CME.O ), the parent company of the New York Mercantile Exchange, was not immediately aware of any technical issues that might have triggered a sharp sell-off in U.S. crude oil futures on Monday afternoon, a CME spokesman said. 
 The entire crude complex on CME Globex including crude oil, RBOB, gasoline and heating oil, "saw a coordinated sell-off of a prolonged duration of 30-minutes" from around 1:50 p.m. EDT to around 2:20 p.m. EDT on Monday, the spokesman said. NYMEX crude oil futures suddenly began to fall around $4 per barrel during mid-afternoon trading to a low of $94.65, after trading at a session high of $99.52.
