 NEW DELHI  (Reuters) - India would be lucky to meet a target to keep the country's fiscal deficit at 5.1 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP), Finance Minister P. Chidambaram said on Monday. 
 The government last week raised diesel prices, a politically controversial move aimed at reining in a widening fiscal deficit and reviving investor sentiment. The government projects a fiscal deficit of 5.1 percent of gross domestic product in India's nearly $1.8 trillion economy in the current fiscal year ending in March, while many private economists predict it to reach 6 percent or more.
