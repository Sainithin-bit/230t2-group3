 MOSCOW  (Reuters) - The order book for a 7.6 percent stake in Sberbank ( SBER.MM ), being sold by the Russian state in a $5 billion-plus secondary offering, is fully subscribed, market sources said on Monday. 
 Russia launched the long-awaited stake sale to reduce its stake to 50 percent plus one voting share, setting a minimum price for the 1.7 billion shares on offer at 91 roubles - a 6 percent discount to Friday's close of 97.05 roubles.
