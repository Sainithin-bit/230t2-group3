 LONDON  (Reuters) - Britain's fraud-busting agency on Friday said it had agreed to investigate the Libor interest rate-rigging scandal, which on Tuesday led to the departure of Barclays ( BARC.L ) chief executive Bob Diamond. 
 "The SFO Director David Green QC has today decided formally to accept the Libor matter for investigation," the Serious Fraud Office said in a brief statement. The SFO said Monday it would decide within a month whether to press criminal charges over the Libor affair, amid concerns banks understated their borrowing costs to make it appear they were in better financial health than they were.
