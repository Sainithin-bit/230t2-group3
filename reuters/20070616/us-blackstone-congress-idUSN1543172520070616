 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress could move as early as July toward passage of a bill to raise taxes on Blackstone Group LP BG.UL and other private equity firms that go public, congressional staffers said on Friday. 

 Backers of the bill were expected to spend the immediate future weighing reaction to it, with an eye on the narrowing window for legislation ahead of a scheduled August recess and the 2008 election campaigns kicking into high gear. An aide to Montana Democratic Sen. Max Baucus, one of the bill's co-authors, said, "There's no immediate timetable for action, but we'll move forward as appropriate." The financial world was stunned on Thursday when the bill was introduced by Baucus, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and its senior Republican, Iowa's Charles Grassley. The bill is aimed at closing what some lawmakers see as a tax loophole that would allow private equity firms and hedge funds to become publicly traded companies without having to pay the same taxes paid by corporations. It has the potential to more than double the effective tax rate on publicly traded partnerships to as much as 35 percent from the 15 percent now paid by partners. Blackstone, one of the nation's largest private equity firms, said on Friday that if the bill becomes law it could lower the company's profits and its overall value. Blackstone is planning to go public later this month in an offering valued at roughly $4 billion. On another front, House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank on Friday asked the Securities and Exchange Commission for its views on the Blackstone IPO. In a letter made available to Reuters, Frank asked the investor protection agency for its perspective on "concerns about the nature, structure, and effects of the proposed IPO" that had already been raised by the AFL-CIO. The labor federation on May 16 asked the SEC to force changes to the stock offering, specifically by requiring Blackstone to register with the SEC as an investment company and follow the same regulations governing mutual funds. BIPARTISAN CLOUT SEEN Baucus and Grassley together may have enough clout to propel their bipartisan bill ahead without co-sponsors, and possibly without a public hearing, as part of any of a number of tax measures already moving through the Senate, aides said. The so-called Blackstone bill was attracting support from at least one other Senate Democrat on Friday. A spokesman for Illinois Sen. Barack Obama, a presidential candidate, said, "We are inclined to support it, based on what we've seen so far." But tax legislation must originate in the House of Representatives and the outlook there was less clear. New York Democrat Charles Rangel, chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, has praised the bill and said private equity firms should be "on notice" that Congress may act. A spokesman for the Ways and Means panel said its top Republican, Jim McCrery of Louisiana, has discussed the Baucus/Grassley bill with Rangel and views it as a matter worth examining and possibly holding a public hearing on. The Bush administration struck a cautious note. "We are reviewing their proposal," White House spokesman Scott Stanzel said, referring to the Senate bill. U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Robert Kimmitt said his department has been "looking at the question" of tax rates on private equity funds going public. "We believe in a tax code that is simple, that is fair, (and) that has the lowest rates that are appropriate," Kimmitt told CNBC television. Experts off Capitol Hill gave mixed opinions. "Congress can't be stopped. Nothing unites Democrats and Republicans like the chance to stomp on a very successful tax shelter because it makes them a hero to their constituents," said Columbia University Law School Professor John Coffee. But an investment analyst report from Deutsche Bank said the bill "has little chance of passing." It said conservative Senate Republicans "will likely link with (New York Democratic) Senator (Charles) Schumer ... to stop this proposal. Chances of passage are very low." Schumer, along with Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, has expressed concern about excessive regulation and litigation making American capital markets less competitive internationally. Paulson led the giant Wall Street firm Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) before he joined the Bush administration last July.
