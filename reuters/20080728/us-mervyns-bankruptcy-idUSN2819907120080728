 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Privately-owned department store chain Mervyns LLC will file for bankruptcy protection within the next few days barring a last minute cash infusion, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday on its website, citing people familiar with the situation. 

 Mervyns did not immediately return a call seeking comment. The lower-cost chain, which Target Corp ( TGT.N ) sold in 2004 to a private investment group that included Sun Capital Partners, Cerberus Capital Management, Lubert-Adler and Klaff Partners LP, operates some 175 stores in seven states. Mervyns, which relies heavily on promotions and discounts on its clothing and home goods, has struggled of late due in large part to its exposure to the California and Arizona markets, where the housing market has bottomed out. Department stores in general have suffered during the U.S. economic downturn, as consumers cut back trips to the mall and instead turn to discounters such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ), where they can buy food, clothing, home supplies and gasoline. The Journal reported previously that Mervyns private-equity buyers would not lose much from a liquidation of the company due to the way the deal was structured. Trendy apparel retailer Steve & Barry's LLC filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection earlier this month, coming on the heels of home goods retailer Linens 'n Things, which filed for protection in May.
