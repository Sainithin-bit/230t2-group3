 PARIS  (Reuters) - Proposals currently under discussion at global trade talks are not acceptable to France as they stand, government spokesman Luc Chatel said on Monday after a meeting of the French cabinet. 

 "(The) Cabinet considers that the project currently on the table is not acceptable as it stands as it contains no advance on absolutely essential elements," Chatel said. He said measures to protect standards on indicating the geographical origin of products and to defend European industrial interests in the face of emerging countries were not sufficient.
