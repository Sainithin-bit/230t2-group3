 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Amgen Inc ( AMGN.O ) reported a lower but better-than-expected second-quarter profit on Monday due to declining sales of its anemia drugs, which have been hurt by safety concerns and reimbursement restrictions. 

 But positive news about its most important experimental medicine, the osteoporosis drug denosumab, have helped its share price recover dramatically. The world's largest biotechnology company by sales said its net profit fell to $941 million, or 87 cents per share, from $1.02 billion, or 90 cents per share, a year ago. Excluding items, the Thousand Oaks, California-based company earned $1.14 per share. Analysts, on average, expected $1.03 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Amgen shares, under assault for most of 2007, have been recovering, rising some 30 percent this year as positive denosumab data has drowned out the steady drum beat of bad news involving its once top-selling anemia drugs.
