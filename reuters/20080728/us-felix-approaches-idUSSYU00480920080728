 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Felix Resources Ltd FLX.AX, an Australian coal miner with a A$3.5 billion ($3.3 billion) market value, said it had received takeover approaches, though no formal bid had yet emerged, sending its shares up as much as 13 percent. 

 Felix is the latest Australian coal miner to become a target, with major foreign steelmakers in particular keen to increase their exposure given surging prices for their key feedstock, metallurgical coal. The Australian Financial Review paper reported on Monday that Felix had allowed several parties to start due diligence, but did not name any of the potential buyers. Felix said in a statement that the interest it had received was "preliminary, incomplete, non-binding and conditional." It has appointed Citigroup and Wilson HTM as advisers. In May, ArcelorMittal ( ISPA.AS ), the world's No. 1 steelmaker, bought a 15 percent stake in Macarthur Coal Ltd MCC.AX for $604 million and began talks on a possible deal, though the talks ended without an agreement being reached. ArcelorMittal has since lifted its stake in Macarthur to 19.9 percent, while South Korean steelmaker POSCO ( 005490.KS ) holds 10 percent. Thermal coal prices struck a record high of $201 a tonne on July 1, but have since retreated in line with oil prices. Metallurgical coal prices have more than doubled in the past year, driven by strong demand from China's growing steel-making industry. Felix shares were up 11 percent at A$19.53 by 0037 GMT, off an earlier high of A$19.87, while Macarthur coal was up 6 percent at A$14.33.
