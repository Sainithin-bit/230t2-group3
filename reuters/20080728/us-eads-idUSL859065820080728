 HAMBURG, Germany  (Reuters) - Dubai-based airline Emirates EMAIR.UL on Monday signed a letter of intent for 60 additional Airbus ( EAD.PA ) aircraft in a deal worth $13 billion at list prices. 

 Emirates, which was also taking delivery of the first of 58 Airbus A380 superjumbo jets, was firming up 30 options for A350 XWB aircrafts after it signed a deal for 70 A350s with options for 50 more at the Dubai air show last year. It also plans to buy 30 additional A330-300 jets. Airbus said the 60 orders would be firmed up and put in its order books in the coming months. This would take firm orders for its A350, designed to take on Boeing's ( BA.N ) delayed 787 Dreamliner, to 500. EADS shares were down 1.9 percent at 12.52 euros by 5:08 a.m. EDT, off a session low at 12.26. (Reporting by  James Regan ; Editing by Erica Billingham)
