 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Stocks fell sharply on Monday, following a fall in Europe, as fear of more credit losses slammed the banking sector and spurred a new flight to safety through purchases of U.S. government debt. 

 The failure of two small U.S. banks late on Friday renewed jitters about financial stocks, the were the biggest drag on the Dow, the S&P 500. In Europe, the leading stock index was also pulled down by disappointing corporate results. The dollar eased as persistent credit worries cast a pall over the health of the U.S. economy despite somewhat upbeat housing and consumer sentiment data on Friday. Concern over the battered U.S. financial sector came to the fore after Merrill Lynch MER.N said Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEH.N may post a loss in the third quarter and take a further $2.5 billion write-down on home loans. Then shares of Merrill Lynch itself fell more than 11 percent to $24.33 Lehman shares dropped 10.4 percent to $15.27. Among otheother banks that took big hits, Citigroup ( C.N ) fell more than 7 percent to $17.43 and Bank of America ( BAC.N ) was off more than 5 percent at $28.06. "People are just very skittish here... you still have all the worries about the financial sector," said Richard Lee, managing director of fixed income at brokerage Wall Street Access in New York. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp seized two small U.S. banks, First National Bank of Nevada and First Heritage Bank NA of California, and sold them to the Mutual Omaha Bank. In a semiannual report on global financial stability, the International Monetary Fund underlined that the worst of the credit crisis may not be over. Global markets remain under strain from the U.S. housing crisis and fragile financial markets has made it more difficult for central banks to hike rates to fight inflation, the IMF said. "People are still afraid of the bad news from the financial sector," said Victor Pugliese, director of listed equity trading at Broadpoint Securities in San Francisco. "Any time you see a bank failing, whether it's a big bank or a small bank, it's going to be a problem because it says financials are not out of the woods." Among other banks that took big hits, Citigroup ( C.N ) fell more than 7 percent and Bank of America ( BAC.N ) was off more than 4 percent. Banks also fell in Europe, where Citigroup cut its stance on banks to "underweight" from "neutral." UBS ( UBSN.VX ) fell 5.5 percent, Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ) dropped 4.1 percent and Barclays ( BARC.L ) lost 5 percent. "There is a deep-seated problem with many of these banks," said David Buik of Cantor Index in London. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  fell 239.61 points, or 2.11 percent, at 11,131.08. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  slid 23.39 points, or 1.86 percent, at 1,234.37. TheNasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  declined 46.31 points, or 2.00 percent, at 2,264.22. Government debt prices rose in light trade as many investors hesitated to make decisions before a monthly reading of nonfarm U.S. payrolls on Friday, often a key catalyst for the bond market. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose 22/32 to yield 4.02 percent. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond added 34/32 to yield 4.62 percent. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index closed down 0.9 percent at 1,158.86 points, falling for a third session in a row. But the European market's fall was cushioned by buoyant mining shares, helped by gains in metal prices. Energy stocks rose ahead of key quarterly results in the sector expected this week and as oil recovered from a recent sharp drop. Royal Dutch Shell ( RDSa.L ), BP ( BP.L ) and Total ( TOTF.PA ) rose slightly as crude oil edged higher. Oil prices rose more than $1 after militant attacks slashed Nigerian oil production and Iran stirred geopolitical tensions by suggesting it was rapidly expanding its nuclear program. Gains were limited by fresh evidence high prices were shrinking U.S. demand, a trend that has contributed to a record sell-off in oil prices since a peak in mid-July. U.S. crude gained $1.47 to settle at $124.73 a barrel, down from the July 11 record over $147. London Brent rose $1.32 to $125.84 a barrel. Gold ended slightly higher as the metal's alternative investment appeal received a boost from worries about the financial sector. A sagging dollar and a rise in crude prices also lifted gold's appeal. Gold rose to $928.45/929.65 by New York's last quote. The euro rose 0.20 percent at $1.574. The dollar fell against major currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index .DXY off 0.19 percent at 72.683. Against the yen, the dollar  JPY=  fell 0.39 percent at 107.43. Asian stocks were mixed as financial sector uncertainty lingered ahead of a slew of company earnings. Japan's Nikkei share average  .N225  edged up 0.1 percent after U.S. economic data from Friday spurred hopes for the country's weakened export sector. Outside Japan, shares in Asia-Pacific were down 0.2 percent, according to an MSCI index.
