 PHILADELPHIA  (Reuters) - Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co KKR.UL, one of the world's biggest private equity firms, said it would buy its publicly listed Amsterdam investment fund and relist the new company on the New York Stock Exchange.

The information below provides details on KKR, and its plans for the proposed transaction, according to KKR's presentation for investors. -- KKR, founded in 1976, has $61 billion in assets under management.
