 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oil prices rose more than $1 on Monday after militant attacks slashed Nigerian oil production and Iran stirred geopolitical tensions by suggesting it was rapidly expanding its nuclear program. 

 The gains were limited somewhat by fresh evidence that high prices were shrinking demand in the United States -- a trend that has contributed to a record sell-off in oil prices since the mid-July peak. U.S. crude gained $1.47 to settle at $124.73 a barrel, down from the July 11 record above $147. London Brent rose $1.32 to $125.84 a barrel. The main militant group in Nigeria's Delta region said Monday it attacked two Royal Dutch Shell ( RDSa.L ) pipelines. Shell said it halted some production due to the incident but declined to say how much.  The incident in Africa's biggest oil exporter followed the kidnapping of eight foreign oil workers last week. Developments in Iran also provided some support. The country has more than 5,000 active centrifuges for enriching uranium, its president said, suggesting a rapid expansion of nuclear work.  President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's announcement was likely to annoy major powers which have offered Iran a package of economic and other incentives to suspend its enrichment activities. Oil's gains were trimmed somewhat after fresh evidence that surging oil prices and an economic slowdown in the United States were cutting into demand from the world's biggest consumer nation. The U.S. Transportation Department said in a report the number of miles driven on U.S. highways in May fell by a record 3.7 percent from last year -- the biggest drop ever for the month which usually sees increased traffic due to Memorial Day vacations and the beginning of summer. The data reinforced concerns that oil prices had become unsustainably high after a six-year, 600 percent rally driven partly by an economic boom in China. Data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission released on Friday showed that speculative funds were shifting to a net short position -- a bet on falling prices -- for the first time in 17 months.  Traders will have their next glimpse at U.S. oil stockpiles on Wednesday, when the U.S. Energy Information Administration issues its weekly report.  Analysts polled by Reuters on Monday expected the report to show a decrease in inventories of crude oil after Hurricane Dolly delayed some imports along the Gulf Coast last week.
