 GENEVA  (Reuters) - Talks to revive a world trade deal are "close to closure" but some big issues remain on the table, World Trade Organization chief Pascal Lamy said on Monday, according to his spokesman. 

 "We're close to closure on what is a very substantive achievement. Let's go that short distance to the summit," Keith Rockwell quoted Lamy as telling ministers on the eighth day of talks to settle core elements of the WTO's Doha talks. (Reporting by  William Schomberg  and  Robin Pomeroy )
