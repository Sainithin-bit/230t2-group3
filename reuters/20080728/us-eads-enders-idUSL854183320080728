 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - The chief executive of EADS ( EAD.PA ) aircraft business Airbus has not yet given the all-clear to production hassles that have beset the Airbus A380 jumbo jet, a German newspaper reported. 

 "Assembly problems are over only when we have reached stable serial production. We have a lot of work ahead of us until then," Thomas Enders was quoted as saying by the Hamburg Abendblatt newspaper in a report on Monday. "This year we will produce around one A380 a month. That is a start. We want to boost the rate significantly in 2009 and 2010," he said. He said the delivery of the first A380 to Emirates airline EMAIR.UL on Monday was a milestone.
