 LONDON  (Reuters) - Investors face something of a new landscape in financial markets this week after tumbling oil and food prices eased immediate concerns about inflation, potentially freeing central banks to fight slow economic growth. 

 The focus, however, will also be on some old stalwarts -- a continuing stream of corporate earnings reports and the monthly U.S. jobs report for July, a bellwether for the health of the dominant U.S. economy. The past two weeks have seen major falls on commodity markets, which until recently were booming. They had provided investors with gains but also headaches because of the impact of high prices on companies and economies. That has now turned around. Since hitting a record peak above $147 a barrel on July 11, oil has fallen around 15 percent. Food prices have seen similar moves. Wheat is down around 18 percent in the past month while corn has lost around 25 percent. From a broad investor perspective, this can be good news, assuming it continues. Falling prices take away the worry of inflation combining with slow global economic growth to create stagflation, one of the hardest climates in which to invest. "If oil was to fall more, then you would have a rise in risk appetite. That would make the investment climate a better one," said Michael O'Sullivan, head of UK research and global asset allocation at Credit Suisse's private bank. Stocks would also benefit from lower projected costs for transportation, energy and basic resources. Bonds could also concentrate on fundamentals rather than worrying about inflation eating into their returns. But the impact of lower oil and commodity prices will not be uniform. Goldman Sachs noted last week, for example, that the decline in agriculture commodity and oil prices had changed the "skews of risk" for emerging market assets. Inflationary pressures on energy-importing countries should ease but commodity exporters would not find business as lucrative as it has been recently. At the same time, there have already been signs of sector shifts within developed stock markets. Investors have been switching from soaring energy sector stocks into beaten down financials, reversing the previous trend. "The fates of these asset combinations remain tightly bound together at present even if the direction has reversed brutally," Goldman said. SHORT OR LONG The question for investors is whether the slump in oil and commodity prices is set to last or whether it is simply a temporary clawback brought on by overstretched rises. There is some evidence, for example, that the fall in oil began when hedge funds started to take short positions based on a technical relationship with other prices. Others argue that the fundamentals that have been pushing oil higher -- the industrialization of major emerging markets, limits on supply -- have not gone away. "We ... expect the oil price to moderate over the coming months before strengthening in late 2009 and early 2010 as supply/demand fundamentals tighten again," Investec Asset Management said in its latest energy outlook. Commerzbank, by contrast, is expecting growth in China and other vibrant emerging market economies to follow developed markets into slowdown and stifle demand. It sees oil averaging $100 a barrel next year compared to a forecast $115 this year. Easing price pressures could help central banks out of the dilemma of weighing the need for higher interest rates to combat inflation against the desire for lower ones to stimulate faltering economic growth. "The pullback in oil -- particularly if it extends -- potentially represents a meaningful shift in the near-term trading landscape," Goldman said. "Not only could it continue to force people out of favored sector trades," it said, "but by improving the growth-inflation trade-off and the policy dilemma for central banks, it is a more favorable dynamic for broader equity risk." EARNINGS AND JOBS Investors, meanwhile, will have more on their mind this week than just the commodity markets, important though they are to the trading environment. The corporate earnings season is in full swing in both the United States and Europe, and a number of major firms still have to report, mainly in Europe. Among those due to make announcements are Siemens ( SIEGn.DE ), Bayer BAYG.DE and BASF BASF.DE plus financial firms Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ), Santander ( SAN.MC ), BBVA ( BBVA.MC ), UniCredit ( CRDI.MI ), HBOS HBOS.L and Lloyds TSB ( LLOY.L ). With about 10 percent of the DJ STOXX 600 .STOXX index of European firms having reported by the end of last Thursday, the number of firms which have beaten expectations outstripped disappointments by 33 to 28, based on Thomson Reuters data. The U.S. season is further along, with about 50 percent of the S&P 500  .SPX  having reported. Results have been generally good, with 68 percent beating expectations. The week will culminate with the release of U.S. payrolls data on Friday. Markets will be on the usual tenterhooks, looking to see to what extent the U.S. economic slowdown is destroying jobs and thus threatening all-important consumer spending.
