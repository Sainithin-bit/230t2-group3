 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wall Street earnings are "unlikely" to recover in the second half of this year meaning New York City's fiscal deficits could soar above the mayor's forecasts, the state comptroller warned on Monday. 

 The securities industry, the New York's economic heart, lost 40,800 jobs in the last recession, but Mayor Michael Bloomberg's budget assumes it will only lose 25,000 jobs this time around, Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli said in a report. That would only be a 13.4 percent decline from the sector's most recent peak in employment of around 188,000 employees working in banks and brokerages in September 2007. DiNapoli was one of three monitors who issued reports on the city's budget on Monday at the annual meeting of the state Financial Control Board, which was set up to rescue the city from a debt crisis in the mid-1970s. The Democratic state comptroller and the Financial Control Board both forecast much bigger deficits than Mayor Bloomberg, whose second and final term ends in January 2010. DiNapoli said the city faces a $4 billion shortfall next year, up sharply from Bloomberg's $2.3 billion estimate. DiNapoli said deficits will average $7.4 billion in each of the next two years, adding Bloomberg had only projected a $5.2 billion gap in 2011, and then a $5.1 billion deficit. Similar forecasts were issued by the Financial Control Board. It projected next year's shortfall at about $4 billion, and deficits of $7.5 billion in each of the next two years. The mayor, an independent, who attended the meeting, said city property tax owners will find out over the next few months whether they will get a 7.0 percent property tax cut for the second year in a row. Bloomberg tried but failed to persuade the Democratic-led City Council to reverse that property tax cut in the new budget that started on July 1. He and the Council agreed they might have to address that issue again in the coming months. "Even if a miracle were to occur and the economic downturn didn't hurt our city and state, fiscal prudence is not a bad (policy)," said Bloomberg, who has enacted budget cuts. "And I think everybody thinks we will have problems," he added. Though the city's latest budget only boosts the spending it controls by 1.6 percent, many of its programs are set by the state and federal government. DiNapoli calculated that total spending will shoot up 21 percent in the next three years. City Comptroller William Thompson, a possible Democratic mayoral candidate, was the most optimistic of the three monitors. Saying the city was "well-positioned" to ride out a downturn, his budget gap estimates were only slightly bigger than the mayor's at $2.05 billion next year, $5.7 billion in 2011, and $5.4 billion in 2012. Thompson said revenues from the property, personal income and sales taxes should outperform Bloomberg's estimates. Gov. David Paterson, who chaired the meeting, said on Monday he might recall the legislature to fix the state's deepening budget problems, saying an immediate attack was the best way to confront the problem. Paterson also supported Bloomberg's criticisms of state government. The mayor noted the state siphoned off $12 billion a year in tax revenues and criticized it for enacting ever more costly benefits for city workers. "The mayor was pretty accurate by my point of view," Paterson said. Public employees might need to rethink their positions, Paterson said: "I do sense that perhaps public servants are not perhaps understanding the circumstances and the need to address it in the city."
