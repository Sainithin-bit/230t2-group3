 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Loews Corp ( L.N ) posted a second-quarter profit of $4.96 billion on Monday, reflecting the split-off of its Lorillard Inc cigarette unit. 

 Profit from continuing operations, excluding the split-off, rose 21 percent to $511 million, or $1.00 per share, as improved results at oil drilling and pipeline units offset lower premiums and higher storm losses at commercial insurer CNA Financial Corp ( CNA.N ), Loews' largest unit. Loews, a New York-based conglomerate run by the billionaire Tisch family, said it ended June with $4 billion of cash and investments. Chief Executive James Tisch said on a conference call that "we are in no hurry to spend our cash," despite the perception that "opportunities abound to buy cheap assets." The $4.96 billion profit was up from $654 million a year earlier. It reflected a tax-free, non-cash gain of $4.29 billion from the disposal in June of Loews' stake in Lorillard ( LO.N ), whose cigarette brands include Newport and True. Tisch has said the tobacco business was not a key focus and that the split-off would improve Loews' risk profile. Profit attributable to Loews shareholders rose to $4.86 billion, or $9.54 per share, from $513 million, or 95 cents, a year earlier. Earnings excluding Lorillard and investments was $575 million. Revenue rose 12 percent to $3.92 billion. Loews' businesses include financial, energy and hotel companies. The company changed its stock symbol to "L" from "LTR" last month. INSURANCE DOWN; ENERGY, DRILLING UP Quarterly profit at Chicago-based CNA, the seventh-largest U.S. commercial insurer, fell 17 percent to $181 million, or 67 cents per share. Operating profit, excluding investments, fell 21 percent to $250 million, or 93 cents per share. On that basis, analysts' average forecast was 96 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Loews owns 90 percent of CNA. "Rates continue to drop slowly but persistently," CNA Chief Executive Stephen Lilienthal said on a conference call. "Terms and conditions are likewise eroding. We expect these conditions to continue through '08 and into '09." Houston-based Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc ( DO.N ), in which Loews has a 51 percent stake, said last week quarterly profit rose 65 percent to $416.3 million, or $2.99 per share, as tight supply and high demand lifted rates for its rigs. Boardwalk Pipeline Partners LP ( BWP.N ), an Owensboro, Kentucky, natural gas transportation and storage company in which Loews has a 70 percent stake, on Monday said quarterly profit rose 83 percent to $64.7 million. HighMount Exploration & Production LLC, a natural gas unit that Loews wholly owns, posted quarterly profit of $48 million. Profit rose 36 percent at Loews Hotels to $19 million. In midday trading, shares of Loews rose $1.24 to $43.16, CNA added 18 cents to $25.15, and Boardwalk rose 96 cents to $24.00. (Editing by John Wallace)
