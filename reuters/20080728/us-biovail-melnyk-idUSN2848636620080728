 TORONTO  (Reuters) - Eugene Melnyk may have withdrawn from the messy battle for control of Biovail Corp BVF.TO BVF.N, but the Canadian drug company's controversial founder seems to have no intention of fading away. 

 Less than a year after tearily announcing retirement plans to spend more time with his family, his stable of expensive racehorses and his hockey team, the Ottawa Senators of the National Hockey League, Melnyk returned to the spotlight with an acrimonious battle for control of Biovail, a company he developed from a medical trade magazine in his parent's Toronto garage almost 20 years ago. The battle took an odd turn on Monday when the 49-year-old billionaire abandoned his plan to oust the Canadian drugmaker's board of directors and elect his own team at a shareholders' meeting next month. Instead, Melnyk, Biovail's biggest shareholder with about 12 percent of the outstanding shares, said he would proceed with alternate plans to develop his own private drug company. While his plans for control of the boardroom were dropped, Melnyk vowed he would keep an eye on the company's every action. "I will continue to monitor the actions and progress of the Biovail board and will take such action as I feel is appropriate in the interests of myself and the remaining Biovail shareholders," Melnyk said in a statement on Monday. Melnyk, who owns a luxurious home in Barbados and commutes regularly aboard his private jet to most of his team's games, is no stranger to the bright glow of the spotlight. Nor is he afraid to step into the ring in search of a good fight. He has been the subject of a string of regulatory and legal wranglings including accusations of fraud by U.S. and Canadian securities regulators. The Toronto-born businessman also took on some of the biggest U.S. research firms and hedge funds after they issued negative views on Biovail's stock, which he claimed conspired to drive down the share price. The company, which sued several firms and funds, eventually settled with Banc of America Securities and a former analyst in 2007. He even attempted to scotch the company's annual general meeting last month by yanking his shares from the board of directors' vote minutes before the meeting was to begin. But, in an equally crafty move, the company dropped its requirements for a quorum from 51 percent to 25 percent to push the vote through. An Ontario judge recently ordered the company to reconvene its annual shareholders meeting held on June 25. Biovail's slate won the overwhelming support of shareholders who voted, but the judge ruled that the vote was taken improperly. A reconvened meeting will be held August 8 in Toronto. Melnyk said he had lost confidence in the board and was keen to see it replaced after Biovail's current management said it would shut manufacturing operations in Puerto Rico and shift the company's focus to new treatments for disorders of the central nervous system. Despite stepping down as chairman at the company's annual meeting last year, no one expects Melnyk to ride off quietly into the sunset. "I don't think that he is out of the picture by any stretch. He is still the largest shareholder and he still has vested interest in where this company goes," said Scotia Capital analyst John Maletic. "I don't think that we have seen the last of him."
