 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Amgen Inc ( AMGN.O ) reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on a surprising rebound in sales of its anemia drug Aranesp from the preceding quarter, and the company raised its 2008 forecast. 

 Shares of the world's largest biotechnology company by sales rose 2 percent in extended trade on Monday on top of the day's 12 percent gain that was driven by positive news about Amgen's most important experimental medicine, the osteoporosis drug denosumab. Aranesp, which has been dogged by safety concerns and reimbursement restrictions for the last year and a half, saw a slowing of its recent steep decline, and sales far exceeded expectations for the quarter. Second-quarter net profit fell to $941 million, or 87 cents per share, from $1.02 billion, or 90 cents per share, a year ago. Excluding items, Amgen earned $1.14 per share, blowing past analysts' average expectation by 11 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. "Our overall financial performance is stronger than we expected and our new revenue and earnings guidance range suggests a strong possibility we will actually grow this year compared to 2007," Amgen Chief Executive Kevin Sharer said during a conference call with analysts and investors. Amgen raised its full-year forecast to earnings of $4.25 to $4.45 per share from its prior view of $4.00 to $4.30 per share. Analysts had been forecasting $4.19 for the year. The Thousand Oaks, California-based company now expects 2008 revenue of $14.6 billion to $14.9 billion, up from $14.2 billion to $14.6 billion. "Everything looks very encouraging," Cowen and Co analyst Eric Schmidt said. "They upped both the bottom-line and the top-line guidance. That ought to give investors confidence that second-quarter trends will continue." Schmidt noted that investors have been concerned about Amgen's ability to hit earnings targets. "If this is as bad as it gets for Amgen I think this company is in pretty darn good shape," he said. The erosion of the anemia franchise slowed considerably in the quarter as worldwide sales of red blood cell booster Aranesp, long considered Amgen's most important product, fell 13 percent from a year ago to $825 million. But that was an increase on previous-quarter sales of $761 million and crushed Wall Street's diminished expectations of $727 million. Sales of the older Epogen, which is used primarily in kidney dialysis patients and has been hit with similar safety concerns, fell slightly to $622 million from $624 million and topped expectations of $583 million. The strength in Aranesp sales "just shows that it's hard to kill a good drug," said Rodman & Renshaw analyst Mike King. He said Amgen's higher guidance indicates the company is confident that upcoming U.S. Food and Drug Administration label restrictions will not be "too deleterious." The results and forecast followed Friday's report that denosumab met primary and all secondary goals in a pivotal fracture study. Treatment with the drug resulted in a statistically significant reduction in new vertebral fractures compared to placebo. "I have to say I'm extremely excited about the results of this study, which frankly exceeded my expectations," said Roger Perlmutter, head of Amgen's research and development. Full results of the denosumab trial are due to be reported at a mid-September medical meeting. Second-quarter sales of Enbrel, a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis and the skin condition psoriasis, rose 2 percent to $841 million, shy of analyst estimates of $855 million. Combined global sales of Neulasta and Neupogen, used to boost white blood cells, rose 15 percent to $1.20 billion, edging past Wall Street estimates of $1.13 billion. Revenue for the quarter rose slightly to $3.76 billion from $3.73 billion and also topped expectations of $3.58 billion. Amgen shares, under assault for most of 2007, have been recovering, rising some 30 percent this year as positive denosumab data have drowned out the steady drumbeat of bad news involving its once-top-selling anemia drugs. Miller Tabak & Co analyst Les Funtleyder said if denosumab does get approved, "we can start talking about growth again." Amgen shares rose to $61.80 in extended trading after rising 12 percent to a Nasdaq close at $60.48. (Additional reporting by Deena Beasley in Los Angeles) (Editing by  Braden Reddall )
