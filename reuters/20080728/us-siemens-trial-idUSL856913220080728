 MUNICH  (Reuters) - A German court gave a former Siemens executive a fine of nearly $170,000 and a two-year suspended prison sentence for his role in setting up slush funds used to win contracts for the German engineering group. 

 Reinhard Siekaczek, 57, was found guilty on 49 counts of breach of trust on Monday in the first trial arising from a sweeping investigation into suspected corruption and bribery that has deeply bruised Siemens's ( SIEGn.DE ) reputation. Siemens has been grappling for more than a year with allegations that it bribed its way into contracts around the world to the tune of at least 1.3 billion euros ($2 billion), according to its own tally of suspect payments booked as fees. Siekaczek, a former sales manager at Siemens' telecoms division, had admitted to building a system of hidden funds. He told the court he later tried to stop the systematic bribery but top managers failed to act. "The defendant channeled money into a network of bogus companies...," presiding judge Peter Noll said in court, adding employees tapped an uncontrolled system of slush funds when they needed to grease palms for business. The judge said Siemens' efforts to fight corruption were incomplete and that Siekaczek was only a cog in a wheel. "One can assume that Mr. Siekazcek was part of a system of organized irresponsibility that was implicitly condoned" and that he had acted at the behest of his superiors, Noll said. The judge also said it was still not clear whether former top executives were involved but it was evident that the company's organization encouraged slush funds and corruption. "Basically all control systems and the entire organization was geared to make such behavior possible," Noll said. NO WAY TO PUT OUT A FIRE The judge said the responsibilities of Siemens' former head of compliance, Albrecht Schaefer, were too narrowly defined. "It's as if you were to equip the fire department with a toothbrush cup to extinguish fires," he said. Schaefer had testified earlier this month that former top management turned a deaf ear to repeated warnings about suspicious payments. The trial of Siekaczek is the result of a years-long investigation by Munich prosecutors, one of several bodies worldwide that are probing activities at Siemens. The affair has already cost the jobs of Siemens' ex-Chief Executive Klaus Kleinfeld and ex-CEO and Chairman Heinrich von Pierer, though they are not accused of criminal wrongdoing, and has led to an upheaval in corporate culture and structures. Von Pierer refused to testify in June, invoking his right not to take the stand on the grounds that he could incriminate himself. According to media reports Siemens will decide on Tuesday whether it will sue 10 former board members, including its former chairman and chief executive, for damages. Siemens shares slipped 1.3 percent to 72.56 euros by 1024 GMT, lagging the German blue-chip DAX index  .GDAXI , which was down 0.9 percent. Siemens' own and other investigations into a suspected organized bribery system at its former telecoms unit have widened from the telecoms unit to include the transportation and power units, among others. They may result in Europe's biggest engineering group's being banned from bidding for certain U.S. contracts. (Additional reporting by  Nicola Leske  in Frankfurt)
