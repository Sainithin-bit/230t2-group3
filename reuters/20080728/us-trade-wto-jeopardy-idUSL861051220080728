 GENEVA  (Reuters) - Resistance by India and China to opening up their markets to more imports has thrown global trade talks into their "gravest jeopardy" since their launch in 2001, a senior U.S. trade official said on Monday. 

 "Their actions have thrown the entire Doha Round -- the Doha Development Round -- into the gravest jeopardy of its nearly seven-year life," the official told ministers from WTO countries, according to a statement. (Reporting by  Doug Palmer ; editing by Sami Aboudi)
