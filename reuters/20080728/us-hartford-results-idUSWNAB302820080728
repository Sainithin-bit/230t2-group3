 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Hartford Financial Services Group Inc ( HIG.N ) earnings fell in the second quarter, hurt by higher catastrophe claims and lower investment returns, but the results still beat Wall Street expectations. 

 Hartford, a large life and property-casualty insurer, said on Monday that operating earnings fell 9 percent to $696 million, or $2.22 a share. On that basis, analysts on average expected the company to earn $2.10 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. The company's shares jumped nearly 4.5 percent to $60.80 a share in post-market trading after closing down 3.86 percent at $58.26 in the New York Stock Exchange's regular session. Hartford's second-quarter net income was 13 percent lower at $543 million, or $1.73 a share, compared with $627 million, or $1.96 a share in the year-ago period. The Hartford, Connecticut-based insurer said catastrophe losses in the period were $171 million, a marked rise from $52 million in the same period a year ago, largely as a result of losses from tornadoes and thunderstorms that ripped through Mid-Western and South-Eastern parts of the United States earlier this year. Net investment income fell 8 percent to $1.2 billion and investments in alternatives such as hedge funds and private equity was less than a quarter of the prior-year period at $25 million. Net realized capital losses were $156 million, compared with $148 million in the second quarter of 2007. (Reporting by  Lilla Zuill ; Editing by  Andre Grenon )
