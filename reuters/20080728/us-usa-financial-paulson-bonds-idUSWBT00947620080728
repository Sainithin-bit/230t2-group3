 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said on Monday that improving the availability of mortgage finance was crucial to boosting the U.S. economy as he unveiled plans to kick start the market for covered bonds. 

 "It is clear to us that the key to the U.S. economy making a major improvement will be turning the corner on housing finance and on the housing correction," he said. "We're not going to be able to do that unless we have availability of mortgage financing, and this is an attractive resource for mortgage financing," he told a news conference to announce that the four biggest U.S. banks were ready to start covered bond issuance "very soon."
