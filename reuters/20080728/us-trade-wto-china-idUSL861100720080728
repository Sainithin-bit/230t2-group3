 GENEVA  (Reuters) - China said on Monday it opposed efforts by rich nations to push developing countries into special deals on individual industrial sectors and reserved the right to protect its sensitive farm products. 

 Such efforts on sectoral deals go far beyond the scope of global farm talks agreed in Hong Kong in 2005, said Lu Xiankun, press counselor at China's World Trade Organization mission. "Priority sectors highlighted by them include machinery, chemicals and automobiles, in which they enjoy substantial export advantage. Naturally, such attempts led to strong and firm reservation by developing members," Lu told Reuters. Rich and poor countries have expressed concern at talks at the WTO to free up world trade that China may seek to limit any opening of its market, which promises some of the biggest potential gains in any deal.
