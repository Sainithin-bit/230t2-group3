 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Top U.S. meat producer Tyson Foods Inc ( TSN.N ) posted lower-than-expected quarterly profit on Monday as high feed prices produced a $44 million loss in its chicken unit, and hedging and forward pricing losses pared profits in its beef business. 

 The company, whose shares fell more than 5 percent, said it paid $140 million more for grain during the quarter to feed its chickens than it did a year ago and it expects grain costs to be up $550 million this fiscal year. Tyson raises the chickens it processes into meat, but buys the cattle and hogs for its beef and pork operations. Springdale, Arkansas-based Tyson reported a third-quarter profit of $9 million, or 3 cents per share, compared with $111 million, or 31 cents, a year earlier. The results included $13 million, or 2 cents per share, in charges for flood damage at a Wisconsin prepared foods plant and impairment of unimproved property in Tennessee. Analysts on average expected net earnings of 12 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. While the earnings missed trade estimates, Wachovia analyst Jonathan Feeney said the results were not particularly bad, since some of the negative news was due to the hedging-forward pricing losses in beef. "We believe Tyson is a solid risk/reward on the coming protein recovery," he said in a note to clients. However, during a conference call with Wall Street analysts, Tyson Chief Executive Richard Bond said the chicken unit may post an even bigger loss in the current quarter. "Our chicken segment will not be positive in Q4 and its losses likely will be greater than Q3," Bond said. "Input costs, especially corn and soybean meal, are a serious concern." Tyson has been raising meat prices, but those increases have not completely offset the higher cost of grain. Corn soared past $7 a bushel this year amid strong demand from livestock producers, exporters, and makers of the biofuel ethanol. In addition, widespread rain and flooding this spring in key growing areas pushed corn prices higher. Tyson shares fell 77 cents, or 4.7 percent, to $15.46 in midday New York Stock Exchange trading. Revenue for the fiscal quarter ended June 28, was $6.85 billion, compared with $6.62 billion a year earlier. In addition to higher feed prices, Tyson and other chicken companies have been hurt by breast meat prices this summer lagging seasonal norms, said Paul Aho, economist with Poultry Perspective. On average, breast meat is selling wholesale at about $1.05 per pound, while chicken companies need $1.50 or more to break even, he said. "Breast meat has not behaved well," said Aho, who speculated the reasons may be too much beef, pork, and chicken on the market and that consumers are cutting back in reaction to higher food and fuel prices. Tyson's beef unit, its largest, earned $3 million versus $36 million a year ago. The decline was largely due to $75 million in losses on cattle hedging activity and forward beef sales. During the call, Bond said Tyson had begun shipping beef to South Korea and that more shipments are due. South Korea was once a key export market for U.S. beef, but only recently started buying again after largely banning it because of mad cow disease concerns. "The outlook for the beef business is good," said Bond. "The (cattle) herd is getting smaller, but in the fall and into our first quarter, there should be ample cattle available for our plants to be able to run efficiently." Early this year, Tyson ended cattle slaughter at its Emporia, Kansas, beef plant in part because the industry had too much slaughter capacity. The pork unit earned $54 million, up from $37 million a year earlier, due in part to lower hog prices, higher pork sale prices, and exports. "Pork exports are very strong, especially to Japan and Mexico," said Bond. Tyson prepared foods unit earned $6 million, down from $26 million a year ago, due in part to higher costs for such inputs as wheat, dairy products and cooking ingredients. Costs related to flood damage at a Wisconsin plant also impacted earnings.
