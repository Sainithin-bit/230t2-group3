 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - All issues with hand-held device access for New York Stock Exchange floor brokers have been revolved, the NYSE said in a statement on Tuesday. 

 Before the market open, the NYSE issued a statement saying some floor brokers at the exchange and NYSE Amex cash equities markets were unable to log in to hand-held devices and that customers should contact their floor brokers to verify connectivity. (Editing by  James Dalgleish )
