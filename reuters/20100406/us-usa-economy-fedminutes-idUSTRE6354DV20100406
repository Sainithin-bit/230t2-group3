 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve could keep interest rates ultra-low for even longer than investors anticipate if the outlook worsens or inflation drops, minutes from the central bank's last meeting suggested. 

 KEY POINTS: * The minutes released on Tuesday showed lingering concern about the U.S. economy's prospects, with policymakers indicating they were in no hurry to raise interest rates. * Officials believed their promise to keep rates low for "an extended period" would not unduly constrain the central bank if it felt the need to tighten monetary conditions. * "The duration of the extended period prior to policy firming might last for quite some time and could even increase if the economic outlook worsened appreciably or if trend inflation appeared to be declining further," the minutes said. * "Such forward guidance would not limit the (policy-setting) committee's ability to commence monetary policy tightening promptly," they said. COMMENTS: DANA SAPORTA, ECONOMIST, STONE & MCCARTHY RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, PRINCETON, NEW JERSEY: "There are a few interesting things, although nothing too surprising. What caught my attention off the bat was that the Fed staff made a presentation to the FOMC about potential approaches for tightening the link between interest rates and the market and interest that is being paid on reserves, and that is very key because right now the Fed is paying 0.25 percent on reserves and yet the fed funds rate continues to trade below that. "What the Fed would like to see is a tighter link between the two so it can feel confident going forward that if they raised the interest on reserves it would raise the fed funds rate as well. That is a key component of their exit strategy -- if that fails it would be concerning because it might mean that they would have to sell off some of their assets perhaps at a faster pace than would be prudent for the market." DOUG ROBERTS, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CHANNEL CAPITAL RESEARCH.COM, SHREWSBURY, NEW JERSEY. "Basically no surprises, if you had to have one statement, we are still in the sweet spot and it is pretty evident we will be there for awhile. There is still enough uncertainty and enough high unemployment that the Fed looks like they will have loose monetary policy for an extended period of time. "Right now what the market is doing is, they are focusing on no surprises, no new additional information. There was some speculation about the discount rate. But even if they did raise the discount rate at this point, they have said specifically that is not the beginning of new monetary policy, it would be a withdrawal of quantitative easing." SUBODH KUMAR, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, SUBODH KUMAR & ASSOCIATES, TORONTO: "Nothing really surprising, It's consistent with what the Fed has been saying. I expected a little more commentary about when or how rates could change, but that isn't a big deal right now. However, it is something the Fed has to address eventually. The Fed should never surprise the market, they need to give some indication of when and how they're going to move things. If they do it suddenly, and say it will happen in the next couple of months, that won't be good for the market." KEVIN FLANAGAN, CHIEF FIXED INCOME STRATEGIST, MORGAN STANLEY SMITH BARNEY, PURCHASE, NEW YORK: "On the surface maybe the minutes are a little bit more dovish than you would have anticipated, given the economic data we have been getting. "It shows the Fed will be very deliberative with rate increases. I still feel they are going to raise rates in the second half this year, but there is no urgency to raise rates for now." KATHY LIEN, DIRECTOR OF CURRENCY RESEARCH, GFT, NEW YORK: "The Federal Reserve is still relatively cautious because they are worried about foreclosures in the housing market and the sustainability of jobs growth. They have grown slightly more optimistic by acknowledging the recovery but they are cautious because they did say the recovery was curbed by unemployment. They do think the economy is moving in the right direction." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stock indexes rose modestly BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices were little changed. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar was slightly weaker against the euro and yen
