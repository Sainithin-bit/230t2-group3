 MELBOURNE  (Reuters) - Top U.S. coal miner Peabody Energy ( BTU.N ) and Hong Kong-based commodities firm Noble Group ( NOBG.SI ) turned up the heat on Tuesday in a battle for control over Australian miner Macarthur Coal MCC.AX. 

 What's next in what could be a long-running saga? MACARTHUR REJECTS BID, BUT AGREES TO POSTPONE GLOUCESTER VOTE Partly bowing to Peabody, Macarthur could reject the new offer but agree to suspend the shareholder vote on its rival deal to take over Gloucester Coal GCL.AX at a board meeting on Wednesday. This appears to be the most likely outcome, given that the Macarthur board did not reject the new offer straight away, the way it did last week. Peabody's offer is contingent on the Gloucester deal not going ahead. If the vote were postponed, it would give Peabody more time to negotiate with Macarthur's board and woo its top shareholders -- China's CITIC Resources Holdings ( 1205.HK ) and steel giants ArcelorMittal SA ( ISPA.AS ) and South Korea's POSCO ( 005490.KS ) -- who together own 47.3 percent of Macarthur. Peabody raised its offer on Tuesday to at least get a hearing with Macarthur, the U.S. company's spokeswoman in Australia said. "We want to remove any sticking point, and the price seems to be a sticking point. So we have improved that offer to encourage the Macarthur board to engage with us so we can further progress the bid," Jennifer Morgans said. Peabody would need to raise its offer again by at least a dollar to A$15 a share, or A$3.8 billion, to get anywhere with minor shareholders. Anything less than A$20 a share would crystallize a loss for ArcelorMittal and POSCO, who bought in at the peak of the market in 2008, so those two are unlikely to sell out anytime soon. MACARTHUR SPURNS PEABODY, PUSHES AHEAD WITH GLOUCESTER VOTE Macarthur could decide to reject Peabody's new offer and confirm that it plans to go ahead with a vote on Monday, April 12, on a deal to take over Gloucester Coal GCL.AX. The rival deal would give Gloucester's key shareholder, Noble Group ( NOBG.SI ), a near one-quarter stake in Macarthur. The market is clearly expecting Macarthur to reject the higher offer, with investors pushing Macarthur shares up 1.6 percent to A$15.10, an 8 percent premium to the new offer after it was announced. "The current shareholders will want a fair bit more," said Tom Elliott, managing director of hedge fund MM&E Capital. CITIC Resources, a founding shareholder in Macarthur, has not revealed its hand, declining to comment on Peabody's offer. POSCO is committed to remaining a long-term shareholder in Macarthur, a POSCO source said on Tuesday. The company had no official comment. "POSCO won't be affected by this M&A talk," the source, who declined to be named, told Reuters. ArcelorMittal so far has declined to comment. TOP SHAREHOLDERS BACK PEABODY BID FOR MACARTHUR Peabody will be in the box seat if Macarthur's major shareholders back its plan. The key factor that could work in Peabody's favor is that Macarthur's bid for Gloucester is not the ideal alternative for Macarthur's top three stakeholders. An independent expert declared the Gloucester deal reasonable but not fair in February, saying the 24.6 percent stake Noble would get in Macarthur was worth more than the assets Macarthur was acquiring. That could make Macarthur's top owners balk at having their stakes diluted by Noble. Noble appeared to be resigned to the deal falling through, saying on Tuesday that if Macarthur's bid for Gloucester did not go ahead, it was prepared to buy out the 12.3 percent of Gloucester Coal it does not already own. That might not be all bad for Noble, with Australian coal assets in the spotlight. "The Peabody bid highlights some undervaluation in Australian coal assets, which is positive for Noble," said Chiu Yen Neo, an analyst at ABN AMRO Private Bank in Singapore, who has a buy recommendation on Noble with a target price of S$3.60. She said the three coal assets Noble owns are worth around A$800 million on a standalone basis. (Additional reporting by Saeed Azhar and  Kevin Lim  in SINGAPORE; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)
