 (Reuters) - In less than 70 years, Toyota Motor went from being a tiny spin-off of a textile loom maker to the world's biggest automaker, guided by a culture of "kaizen", or continuous improvement and a tireless effort to eliminate waste. 

 As the Japanese automaker grows, top managers face the challenge of preventing what it calls "big-company disease", characterized by complacency and murky responsibilities as its workforce of 310,000 expands. Following are some quotes from past and current leaders at Toyota, and the "Toyoda Precepts": five guiding principles drafted in the 1930s by those close to founder Sakichi Toyoda, who started out as a maker of textile looms. KIICHIRO TOYODA, son of Sakichi and second president of Toyota Motor, after design plans for a loom were stolen from his father's firm: "The thieves may be able to follow the design plans and produce a loom. But we are modifying and improving our looms every day ... They do not have the expertise gained from the failures it took to produce the original... We need not be concerned. We need only continue as always, making our improvements." EIJI TOYODA, fifth president and nephew of group founder Sakichi Toyoda, at a 1984 news conference with General Motors Corp to announce a joint venture factory in California: "We consider GM our primary competitor and hope to work hard in healthy competition with the company as the best of rivals." HIROSHI OKUDA, senior adviser and eighth president, 1997: "We wish to make Toyota not only strong but a universally admired company, winning the trust and respect of the world. We must be a company that is accepted wholeheartedly by people around the world, who would think it natural if Toyota became No.1 in size, since we provide attractive products that excel in environmental protection and in safety." KATSUAKI WATANABE, current president, likes to quote Japanese proverbs. On the elusive nature of long-lasting success: "The pitcher goes so often to the well that it is broken at last." Another proverb often heard from Watanabe as a warning against complacency: "Even the sturdiest of dikes is destroyed by an ant-hole". THE TOYODA PRECEPTS 1. Be contributive to the development and welfare of the country by working together, regardless of position, in faithfully fulfilling your duties. 2. Be ahead of the times through endless creativity, inquisitiveness and pursuit of improvement. 3. Be practical and avoid frivolity. 4. Be kind and generous; strive to create a warm, homelike atmosphere. 5. Be reverent, and show gratitude for things great and small in thought and deed.
