 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Ericsson wants to continue its mobile joint venture with Japan's Sony even after the Swedish company bought the wireless assets of Nortel Networks, Ericsson's chief financial officer told a German newspaper on Sunday. 

 "There are no discussions about an end to the partnership," Hans Vestberg said in a prerelease of his interview with Handelsblatt's Monday edition. If the joint venture needs financial support from its parents, "then it would get it from us", he added. Handelsblatt said there had been speculation that Ericsson would soon part ways with Sony on the cell phone business. Ericsson on Friday won an auction for the wireless assets of bankrupt Nortel for $1.13 billion. (Reporting by Marilyn Gerlach, editing by Will Waterman)
