 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - MasterCard ( MA.N ) shares might be a better bargain than Visa Inc ( V.N ), according to a report in Barron's. 

 The weekly newspaper said that while Visa bests MasterCard in debit-card transactions and card swipes, MasterCard's shares are less expensive than Visa's and may be a better play on an economic recovery. MasterCard trades at 15 times its anticipated earnings, but if it begins trading at 16 times earnings, its shares could soar above $200, Barron's said. MasterCard shares closed Friday at $185.87. Visa ended the week at $67.29. "Recovery or no, the payment-processing industry's year-over-year comparisons will start looking better in the December quarter," Barron's said. "The underdog MasterCard should have its day." (Reporting by  Steve Eder ; Editing by  Christian Wiessner )
