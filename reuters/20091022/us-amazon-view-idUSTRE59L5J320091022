 LOS ANGELES/SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Amazon Inc posted quarterly profit that handily beat Wall Street estimates and said holiday sales could come in far above expectations, sending shares of the world's largest online retailer up 8 percent. 

 COMMENTARY: DAN GEIMAN, ANALYST, MCADAMS WRIGHT RAGEN "Numbers look really solid. The stock's trading up considerably in after-hours, so I think they were pretty solid across the board in terms of revenues. "They're just getting better terms from vendors--that's something that's been going on for the past couple of quarters or so. "Consensus estimates for revenue for the next quarter is $8.1 billion, which is the low end of their guidance range, so it looks to be pretty positive. "The Kindle is a good story, but in terms of impact on revenues in any way, it's pretty small. It's got a bigger impact on margins. "I would expect that Amazon is so huge -- doing $5.5 billion in sales -- that it's going to take quite a bit for any single product to have a meaningful impact. "By all indications, it's been a hugely successful product for them, but it's still a pretty small percentage of their revenues." COLIN GILLIS, ANALYST, BRIGANTINE ADVISORS "It's a strong September quarter. I think everyone was expecting a strong result but it came in better than everyone was expecting. They beat on the top and they beat on the bottom. "I have no particular quibble with the September numbers. But then you turn to the guidance and the problem with the guidance is, it is so wide you could drive a truck through it. They historically do that. "Broadly speaking, investors are going to be heartened that consumers are still spending and retail is showing growth and rebounding."
