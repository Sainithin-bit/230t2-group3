 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. pay czar on Thursday ordered compensation be slashed for top earners at financial firms and auto companies that received billions of dollars in federal bailouts. 

 Kenneth Feinberg's rulings are designed to quell public outrage that firms propped up by taxpayers are still issuing eye-popping paychecks at a time the general population grapples with rising unemployment and a sluggish economic recovery. The Obama administration appointed Feinberg in June, and charged him with approving or renegotiating the pay contracts for the 25 highest-paid employees at seven firms receiving "exceptional assistance" under the Troubled Asset Relief Program. In all cases, Feinberg capped base cash salaries at $500,000 and ordered that the remainder of salaries be paid in company stock that must be held for the long-term. Below are key details of his rulings for individual firms: AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP: Cash salaries for the top 25 earners for 2009 will be cut by 91 percent from 2008 levels. Total direct compensation will fall 58 percent from 2008 levels. BANK OF AMERICA: Cash salaries for the top 25 earners for 2009 will be cut 94 percent, total direct compensation will fall 62 percent. CHRYSLER GROUP LLC: No specific percentage cuts were listed. Base salary should not exceed $500,000 per year, except in appropriate cases for good cause shown. CHRYSLER FINANCIAL: Cash salaries for the top 25 earners will be will fall 30 percent; total direct compensation will fall 56 percent CITIGROUP: Cash salaries for the top 25 earners will be cut 96 percent, total direct compensation will be cut 70 percent; GENERAL MOTORS: Cash salaries for the top 25 earners will be cut 31 percent, total direct compensation will fall 20.4 percent.
