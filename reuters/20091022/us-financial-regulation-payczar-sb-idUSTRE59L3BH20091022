 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. pay czar Kenneth Feinberg is scheduled to testify before a House oversight panel on Wednesday, the committee said in a statement. 

 The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee will testify on his report on the pay proposals of the 25 highest-paid employees at seven companies that have received exceptional taxpayer bailouts. That report is expected to be released shortly. Feinberg is expected to order sweeping pay cuts at those companies, which are: AIG, Bank of America, Citigroup, General Motors, Chrysler, GMAC and Chrysler Financial.
