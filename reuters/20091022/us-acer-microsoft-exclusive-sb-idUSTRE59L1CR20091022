 TAIPEI  (Reuters) - Microsoft is working on a new operating system that will be targeted at corporate customers, Acer's chairman said on Thursday, as the software giant launches its next-generation Windows 7. 

 "The tides are turning and it's time for most customers to consider switching to the new system," J.T. Wang told Reuters in an interview. "I don't know when the new corporate-focused system will be launched, but they're looking at designing one now." Microsoft launched Windows 7 on Thursday in one of its most important software releases in more than a decade, aiming to win back customers after its much-maligned introduction of Vista about three years ago.
