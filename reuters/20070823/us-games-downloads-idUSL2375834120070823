 LEIPZIG, Germany  (Reuters) - Sony ( 6758.T ) is in talks to expand a planned video download service for its handheld PlayStation Portable games console from Britain and Ireland to other countries, an executive said on Thursday. 

 Sony and Britain's Sky ( BSY.L ) are due to launch a service early next year that will allow PSP owners to download sports programs, movies and other TV shows to their handheld games console and watch it on the go. David Reeves, head of Sony's European games unit, told Reuters that the company was currently in talks to expand the service to four other countries. He did not say which countries, but named a number which had "content aggregators" of a similar caliber as Sky. "There are other content aggregators ... certainly in Germany, in France, also in Italy, Russia even, Scandinavia certainly and the Netherlands," he said.
