 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Limited Brands Inc ( LTD.N ) said on Thursday it is bringing out products such as a reversible bra and more colorful basics at the Victoria's Secret chain in an effort to pique consumers' interest amid economic woes. 

 The company, which also operates the Bath & Body Works chain, expects the retail environment to remain uncertain this fall, Chief Financial Officer Martyn Redgrave said during a conference call. Redgrave's comments echo similar thoughts from other retailers who have issued cautious forecasts about the second half of the fiscal year due to issues such as higher fuel and food costs and the weak housing market. Despite such pressures, Limited said late on Wednesday that it is comfortable with analysts' consensus earnings estimates for the third and fourth quarters. Shares of Limited were up $1.13, or 5 percent, at $23.38 after rising as high as $24.06 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The company's executives made their comments during a conference call a day after Limited posted higher second-quarter net profit, helped by a gain from the sale of its Express apparel business. During the call, Limited said it expects third-quarter sales at stores open at least a year to be flat, while total sales should fall in a low-single-digit percentage range. The company did not give specific goals for fourth-quarter sales but said it is planning for "sales growth conservatively, consistent with the third quarter." Same-store sales rose 2 percent during the second quarter, while total sales rose 7 percent to $2.62 billion. Second-quarter same-store sales rose 4 percent at Victoria's Secret and fell 4 percent at Bath & Body Works, the company said on Thursday. Bath & Body Works is paring down offerings in a test at 50 stores after realizing that it may now offer too many brands and different sizes of products. Redgrave also said Limited plans to expand its test of selling Victoria's Secret beauty products to La Senza stores in Canada this fall. The company is also aggressively looking at international opportunities for Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works but has not made any specific decisions, Redgrave said. Limited said it now expects $765 million to $790 million of capital expenditures this year, down $25 million from a prior forecast. The decline relates to budgeted capital expenditures for the apparel businesses for the fall. (See  here  for "Shop Talk" -- Reuters' retail and consumer blog) (Reporting by  Jessica Wohl )
