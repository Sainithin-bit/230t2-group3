 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Hormel Foods Corp., the maker of Spam luncheon meat and Dinty Moore canned stew, posted lower quarterly profit on Thursday, hurt by higher pork, beef, chicken and grain costs. 

 Hormel also said it had acquired privately held Burke Corp., which makes pizza toppings and other fully cooked meat products, for about $110 million. Burke has annual sales of $125 million. The acquisition will bolster its position in the pizza-topping industry and add to earnings in fiscal 2008, Hormel said. Net income in the fiscal third quarter, ended July 29, was $57.4 million, or 41 cents a share, down from $59.6 million, or 43 cents a share, a year earlier. The results were in line with analysts' expectations, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 8 percent to $1.52 billion. Sales rose 9 percent in its refrigerated foods segment, which makes up 54 percent of net revenue, boosted by strong sales of flavored meat products and frozen entrees. The company said its specialty food segment benefited from higher sales of nutritional and ready-to-drink products and higher prices, while its international business was helped by sales of its Spam products and Stagg chili. But price increases put in place for grocery products at the beginning of the quarter failed to offset higher commodity costs, Hormel said. The company, which has pointed to rising costs in the past, said it managed to offset all but $5 million of those costs in the latest quarter through such price increases, a better product mix and value-added sales. "The gap on costs vs. pricing is starting to narrow and the 4Q will continue to improve," wrote D.A. Davidson & Co. analyst Timothy Ramey, who raised his Hormel share price target from $35 to $38. Hormel's current quarter earnings are expected to be flat with the year-ago period. HOG SHORTAGE Hormel said its China operations suffered because of a live hog shortage caused by disease issues there. Chief Executive Jeffrey Ettinger said he expects input costs to continue climbing in the current quarter, but stood by a previous earnings forecast of 62 cents to 68 cents a share for the period. Analysts' average forecast is 64 cents a share. Hormel's Jennie-O Turkey Store business, which accounts for 19 percent of total sales, was also offsetting the higher price of grain, used in animal feed, by raising prices, Ettinger said. Higher costs would put pressure on its grocery products margin and specialty products business, he said. For the full year, the company expects to earn between $2.06 and $2.12 per share. Analysts, on average, expect $2.08 per share. But "Hormel will likely need to show some EPS momentum, which we expect in the January quarter," Ramey wrote. Hormel shares were up 30 cents to $34.70 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. (See  here  -- Reuters' retail and consumer blog) (Reporting by Aarthi Sivaraman)
