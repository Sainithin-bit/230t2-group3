 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Social networking Website Facebook is 
working on an advertising system to allow marketers to target 
users with ads based on the information people reveal about 
themselves on the site, the Wall Street Journal reported in its 
online edition early on Thursday. 

  The advertising plan is the company's top priority, the 
Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter. The 
company plans to unveil a basic version late this fall, 
although the plan is at an early stage, according to the 
report.  A Facebook spokeswoman acknowledged to the Journal that the 
company is working on an advertising system, but declined to 
provide details. A Facebook spokesperson declined to comment to 
Reuters.  According to the Journal, people familiar with the plan say 
Facebook is seeking to do what Google Inc ( GOOG.O ) did with 
AdWords, which allows anyone to place ads next to search 
results by buying "keywords" online.  (Reporting by  Lewis Krauskopf )
