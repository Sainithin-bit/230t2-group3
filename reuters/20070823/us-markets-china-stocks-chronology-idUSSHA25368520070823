 SHANGHAI  (Reuters) - The benchmark Shanghai Composite Stock Index  .SSEC  climbed for the first time above the 5,000-point level on Thursday, more than quadrupling since the start of last year. 

 Here are key events in one of the world's biggest equities bull markets. 1990 December 19 - The Shanghai Stock Exchange begins operating and launches the benchmark Shanghai composite index at a base of 100 points. The index hits its all-time low of 90.79 on that day. 1992 May 21 - The index posts its biggest single-day rise of 105 percent in response to the government's pledge to continue the "experiment" in stocks. 1993 February 16 - The index hits a record high of 1,558.95. It will not return to that level for more than six years, mainly because of disagreement within the Communist government over how to treat the stock market. 1996 December 16 - The Communist Party newspaper, the People's Daily, runs an editorial warning against "excessive speculation" after the index had jumped 145 percent over the past 11 months. A two-and-a-half-year bear market begins. 1999 May 19 - The market begins to revive as the government's attitude becomes more benign, rising 68 percent from May 19 to June 30, when it hits a fresh record high.

But a four-year bear market then begins as authorities try to sell non-traded government holdings of shares in listed firms at prices unacceptable to the public. 2005 May - Regulators announce new proposals to remove the $200 billion overhang of non-traded shares, allowing listed companies to compensate the public. 2006 May 8 - Regulators say state share reform is proving successful and they will now encourage large, high-quality companies to list domestically. June - Bank of China ( 601988.SS )( 3988.HK ), the first large initial public equity offer since May's announcement, raises $2.6 billion in China's biggest domestic IPO to date. Oct 27 - Industrial and Commercial Bank of China ( 601398.SS )( 1398.HK ), the country's biggest bank, becomes the first company to list simultaneously in Shanghai and Hong Kong.
