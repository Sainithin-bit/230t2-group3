 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of Countrywide Financial Corp CFC.N trimmed some of their gains after the mortgage lender's Chief Executive Angelo Mozilo told CNBC the market environment is "certainly not getting better" and that he doesn't know when the housing cycle will turn.  

 Countrywide shares were up 5.4 percent at $23 on the New York Stock Exchange, down from a 6.5 percent gain before the interview began.
