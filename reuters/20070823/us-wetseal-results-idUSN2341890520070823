 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Teen clothing and accessories retailer Wet Seal Inc. WTSLA.O on Thursday reported second-quarter profit that edged past Wall Street estimates, but its third-quarter outlook fell below expectations, and its shares dropped more than 6 percent. 

 The company, which operates the Wet Seal and Arden B. chains, said second-quarter net profit rose to $6.8 million, or 7 cents per share, from $4.4 million, or 4 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts, on average, expected 6 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. "Increasing product margins, a positive contribution from new stores and tight cost management" boosted profit, Chief Executive Joel Waller said in a statement. Sales rose to $143.3 million from $129.5 million in the year-ago quarter. The Foothill Ranch, California-based company said it expects same-store sales in August to range between a decrease of 2 percent to an increase of 2 percent. Waller said Wet Seal would plan its third quarter "assuming the recent difficult traffic trends in the specialty retail sector will continue." The company would "tightly control" inventory levels and costs, Waller said. For the third quarter, Wet Seal forecast earnings between 7 cents and 10 cents a share. Sales are expected between $157 million and $161 million. Analysts expected 11 cents a share on $167.6 million in sales. Same-store sales would range between a decrease of 1 percent and an increase of 3 percent in the quarter, Wet Seal said. The company plans to open 32 new stores -- 29 namesake and three Arden B. stores in the current quarter. It said its board authorized a stock buyback of up to 406,300 shares. Wet Seal shares were down 6.1 percent at $4.15 on the Nasdaq.
