 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Countrywide Financial Corp CFC.N led shares of many financial companies higher on Thursday after a $2 billion infusion from Bank of America Corp eased fears the largest U.S. mortgage lender could go bankrupt, and boosted optimism the sector can weather a credit shortage. 

 Wednesday's investment was announced hours after Bank of America ( BAC.N ), Citigroup Inc ( C.N ), JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ) and Wachovia Corp WB.N said they each borrowed $500 million from the U.S. Federal Reserve, an unnecessary but symbolic move to reassure markets that credit is available, if not always for the asking. Analysts said the actions should support shares of financial companies, which have lagged broader market indexes as homeowner delinquencies rose and credit markets tightened, leaving dozens of lenders struggling to borrow. "We view both moves as attempts to 'prime the pump' to get liquidity flowing again," Lehman Brothers Inc. analyst Jason Goldberg wrote. "Since mid-July, the shares of First Horizon National Corp ( FHN.N ) and National City Corp NCC.N have been the hardest hit in our coverage amid mortgage concerns. This news could provide some relief to them and the group." In morning trading, Countrywide shares rose $1.72, or 7.9 percent, to $23.54. They remain far below 2006's year-end level of $42.45, and the $34.06 hit on July 23, the day before the company announced it slashed its full-year earnings outlook. Bank of America shares were little changed in early trading. The Standard & Poor's Financials Index .GSPF rose 0.3 percent. The Amex Securities Broker-Dealer Index .XBD, which includes many Wall Street banks, rose 0.7 percent. CAPITALISM AT WORK Analysts said Bank of America's purchase of 7.25 percent preferred stock convertible into Countrywide shares could make it the latter's preferred lender. If converted, the shares would give the bank about a one-sixth stake in Calabasas, California-based Countrywide. The investment would boost Bank of America's exposure to mortgages, where it ranks fifth in market share, according to the newsletter Inside Mortgage Finance. Kenneth Lewis, the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank's chief executive, called the investment "a step toward a return to a more normal liquidity in the mortgage markets." It also continues Lewis' recent practice of buying strategic stakes in companies such as student lender SLM Corp SLM.N, China Construction Bank ( 0939.HK ) and Brazil's Banco Itau ITAU4.SA ITU.N. "This is capitalism at work," said Richard Sichel, chief investment officer at Philadelphia Trust Co. "Obviously, Bank of America sees value. It's the continuation of money moving and that is a positive for the market and investor confidence. It shows that Countrywide at this price is a viable company." Moody's Investors Service said it may still downgrade Countrywide's "Baa3" senior debt to "junk" status, saying mortgage market "dislocations" could worsen, and hurt loan volume and earnings. It said it might affirm the rating with a "stable" outlook if Countrywide stabilizes its business and reduces its reliance on capital markets for funding. WALL STREET BANKS Improved market liquidity may also help the Wall Street investment banks such as Bear Stearns Cos BSC.N, Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ), Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEH.N, Merrill Lynch & Co MER.N and Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ). Market volatility, sparked in large part by concern over soured mortgages, has caused mounting losses at a variety of hedge funds, including some at Bear Stearns and Goldman. Meanwhile, the resistance among investors to funding riskier transactions has slowed merger activity, especially involving private equity firms, and left investment banks holding acquisition-related loans. "With the Federal Reserve providing liquidity, we believe the investment 'boycott' of fixed income portfolio managers simply won't continue," wrote Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. "August 2007 will ultimately be viewed as a unique investment opportunity -- like Lehman in the September 1998 Russian (debt default) crisis." Hintz recommends Merrill and Morgan Stanley over Bear Stearns, Goldman and Lehman. (Additional reporting by  Chris Sanders )
