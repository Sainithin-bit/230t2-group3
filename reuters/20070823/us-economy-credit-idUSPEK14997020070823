 NEW YORK/LONDON  (Reuters) - The two leading central banks continued to take steps on Thursday to shore up wobbly credit markets, where confidence is returning in baby steps after a full-blown crisis earlier this month. 

 The U.S. Federal Reserve injected $17.25 billion into the banking system and the European Central Bank was inundated with demand for fresh cash in a money-market tender. Late on Thursday a report showed that Friday's move to slash the discount rate, charged for loans directly from the Fed, had won considerable support from the banking community. Average borrowing from the discount window was the most since the week ended September 19, 2001. Earlier, the Bank of Japan balked at an interest rate increase that had been considered a near-certainty as recently as last month, warning that global financial turmoil would take time to settle. The head of the biggest U.S. mortgage lender, however, complained that the Fed's actions had yet to relieve a logjam in credit markets and said the housing market slump was likely to cause a U.S. recession. "We still have a tremendous liquidity problem," Angelo Mozilo, chief executive of Countrywide Financial Corp, said in an interview on CNBC television. Mozilo's comments followed news late Wednesday that Bank of America Corp had invested $2 billion in Countrywide, a move aimed at restoring confidence in the both the besieged mortgage lender and the broader market. While the deal initially unleashed a tide of relief among investors, lifting equity markets in Asia and Europe, it faded quickly on the heels of Mozilo's remarks. Benchmark U.S. stock indexes ended fractionally lower, while short-dated U.S. Treasury yields were higher for a second day as investors unwound recent flight-to-safety bids. Futures dealers continued to trim the chances for the Fed to cut lending rates by 50 basis points in September -- a move seen as a near certainty two days ago. The implied prospects for a half-point rate cut fell to 36 percent. The Fed said the U.S. commercial paper market, a $2 trillion conduit for financing the daily operations of companies, had shrunk by more than 8 percent over the past two weeks as investors balked at putting money anywhere outside of the safest short-term government securities. "Certain portions of the commercial paper market will probably never come back," Bill Gross, manager of the giant PIMCO bond fund, said on CNBC. FED BRINGS MORE CASH In a larger-than-normal series of operations, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York added fresh funds to the U.S. financial system, bringing to $26.5 billion the amount of money it has added to the system since Monday. The bank also redeemed $5 billion of Treasury bill holdings, a move seen as helping it fund anticipated loans directly to banks. The four biggest U.S. banks made a splashy announcement on Wednesday that they had borrowed a total of $2 billion from the discount window, a move seen as encouraging others to do the same to keep credit flowing freely in the economy. Weekly reserve figures showed that primary credit borrowing via the discount window averaged $1.2 billion for the week through Wednesday against just $11 million the previous week. Even apart from the highly publicized $500 million each borrowed by JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America, Citigroup and Wachovia Corp. , the figures showed quite an appetite. "It appears that some of these banks initiated their borrowings before (Wednesday), or that other banks were borrowing at the window prior to Wednesday," said strategists at Action Economics. BOJ ON HOLD In Japan, the BOJ left its benchmark lending rate unchanged for the sixth straight month. Until global markets went into a tailspin on fears of a liquidity crisis, investors had expected the BOJ to lift the rate by a quarter point, to 0.75 percent. BOJ Governor Toshihiko Fukui told reporters adjustments in financial markets would take time and he would closely watch the subprime mortgage crisis for any impact on U.S. growth. "I think it will take some time. Repricing of risk will probably lead to realization of losses. The process could be painful," he said. In Europe, the ECB added 40 billion euros in three-month funds to the euro interbank money market but failed to bring much relief to a market still beset by credit worries. Some 145 banks bid at the first-ever injection of three-month funds outside the ECB's normal monthly schedule, asking for a total of 125.8 billion euros in funding. After data showed German economic growth slowed to 0.3 percent in the second quarter, Economy Minister Michael Glos said it would pick up, but only when market tremors settle. "It's important that the impact of the turbulence in the financial sector remains under control and that markets regain confidence again," he said. STILL NERVOUS But investors were still feeling fragile, on the lookout for fresh fallout from the U.S. home loan debacle and any signs of wider economic damage. The frank comments from Countrywide's Mozilo did little to help improve investor confidence. Asked if he believed the housing slump would lead to a recession, Mozilo answered: "I think so. "I can't believe that when you're having this level of delinquencies, equity is gone, the tide has gone out, that this doesn't have material effect on the psyche of the American people and eventually on their wallet," Mozilo said. Markets continued to be rife with speculation that the Fed would cut the Fed funds rate, its key monetary policy tool. There was also talk that a second discount rate cut could be made. But for now, central bank's efforts to deal with the worst liquidity and credit squeeze in a decade seem to have given the Fed some breathing room. The ECB is still expected to raise rates next month after it said in a statement on Wednesday that its monetary policy was as laid out by President Jean-Claude Trichet on August 2.
