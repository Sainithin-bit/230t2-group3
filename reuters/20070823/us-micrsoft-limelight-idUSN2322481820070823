 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Limelight Networks Inc and Microsoft Corp said on Thursday that they had entered into a technology agreement in which the Web content delivery company will help improve the reliability of the software maker's online services, such as video, music and games. 

 Limelight will provide media streaming and content delivery services to Microsoft under a multiyear deal. The two companies also agreed to cross-license their technologies. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. Limelight competes with Akamai Technologies Inc to help companies deliver graphics, video and music to online users more reliably by finding less congested routes over the Internet. Its customers include DreamWorks, Facebook, and News Corp's MySpace. (Reporting by  Ritsuko Ando )
