 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Whole Foods Market Inc WFMI.O urged a federal appeals court to reject the Federal Trade Commission's antitrust objections to its $565 million acquisition of Wild Oats Markets Inc OATS.O and let the deal proceed. 

 In a redacted copy of a court filing released on Thursday, Whole Foods argued the appeals court for the District of Columbia should reject the FTC's request for an injunction temporarily stopping the merger. "The FTC is merely disappointed that its meager evidence was not convincing," said Whole Foods in the brief. Most of the brief is a reiteration of Whole Foods' contention it competes against larger supermarket chains such as Safeway Inc ( SWY.N ) and not just small, premium stores as the FTC contends. But the tone showed some frustration, with Whole Foods at one point calling an FTC assertion "inaccurate, and unfairly so." "I think we're going to hear from the court of appeals as soon as tomorrow (Friday), obviously no later than the 30th or 31th," said Wild Oats lawyer Cliff Aronson in a telephone interview. One expert put his money on Whole Foods. "I think it looks pretty bad really (for the FTC)," said Keith Hylton, who teaches antitrust classes at the Boston University School of Law. Hylton believed the appeals court would uphold U.S. District Court Judge Paul Friedman's 93-page opinion, which ignored Whole Foods' CEO John Mackey's e-mails expressing a desire to crush the smaller company. "I guess I'd be surprised if the appellate court found reason to overturn his opinion," Hylton said in a telephone interview from Boston. SIDING WITH FTC But an antitrust group and consumer organization said in a brief filed on Thursday that the merger would hurt grocery shoppers and that allowing it to go forward would violate antitrust law. The American Anti-Trust Institute, a Washington think tank, the Consumer Federation of America, made up of groups with 50 million members, and other organizations said the appeals court should grant an injunction stopping the merger. "This acquisition will lead to higher prices, less service and diminished consumer choice," the groups said in their friend of the court brief. Austin, Texas-based Whole Foods operates nearly 200 stores in the United States and Britain, while Wild Oats of Boulder, Colorado, runs about 110.
