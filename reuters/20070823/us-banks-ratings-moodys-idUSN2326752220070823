 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Ratings on Thursday said global banks will be able to shoulder any losses related to the emergency credit lines they provide to issuers of asset-backed commercial paper. 

 Asset-backed commercial paper, or ABCP, is a type of short-term debt that companies and banks issue to raise funds for operations and investments. Most issuing vehicles are required to obtain an emergency credit line or "liquidity backstop" from a bank, often the vehicle's own sponsor. The backstop repays debt investors if the vehicle is suddenly unable to raise enough cash to pay investors itself. With fears about risky U.S. mortgages infecting usually safe short-term debt markets in recent weeks, traditional buyers of commercial paper have shunned the market, preventing many vehicles from raising cash and prompting worries about the impact on banks providing credit lines. But both Moody's and Fitch said during teleconferences on Thursday that they believed banks are prepared for the task. "These institutions will be able to absorb losses," said Reynold Leegerstee, team managing director at Moody's Investors Service. U.S. banks provide more than $300 billion in liquidity to ABCP programs as of March 31, while a conservative estimate of European bank exposure is $891 billion, according to Fitch Ratings. "This is not an unmanageable problem for (the) global banking industry," said Fitch managing director James Moss. Banks provide a "100 percent" liquidity backstop for ABCP vehicles and much smaller credit lines -- between 10 and 20 percent -- for riskier and more leveraged conduits called structured investment vehicles, or SIVs. Given "well-diversified franchises, strong liquidity positions, adequate capital structures and strong earnings power, we maintain our view that the large commercial banks providing liquidity facilities to ABCP conduits and SIVs should be able to honor their commitments," Moody's Leegerstee said. Ian Linnell, a Fitch managing director, said the rating agency "sees no need to take any further rating action on any bank as a result of their conduit exposures," referring to European, Middle Eastern and African banks. Fitch also said it is largely comfortable with the ratings it has assigned on ABCP conduits, but is engaged in an ongoing review that will yield results in the next few days.
