 (Reuters) - Big tech companies are filling the void left by banks and specialty lenders that are retrenching and making financing more difficult for smaller tech firms, the Wall Street Journal said. 

 Companies such as International Business Machines Corp ( IBM.N ), Oracle Corp ORCL.O and Cisco Systems Inc ( CSCO.O ) are lending more of their own money to customers and taking on new risks, according to the paper. Defaults on tech financings, loans that allow companies to purchase computers, software and other products, have spiked this year, the paper said.
