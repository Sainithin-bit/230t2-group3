 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Belgian banking and insurance group KBC received 3.5 billion euros ($4.4 billion) from the government to boost its capital on Monday in the fourth financial sector injection by Belgium in as many weeks. 

 The transaction, via securities issued to the government, will boost KBC's core tier 1 ratio for banking to above 8 percent from close to 7 percent, and its insurance solvency margin to 280 percent, KBC and the government said on Monday. The transaction, almost an exact mirror of last week's Dutch deal with ING, would not dilute existing shareholdings. KBC shares were extremely volatile at the opening and were down 8.2 percent at 24.50 euros at 7:10 a.m. EDT, while the DJ Stoxx European banking index was off 7.1 percent. Ivan Lathouders, analyst at Bank Degroof, said the measures should put capital concerns to rest and should support the shares, particularly because of the limited dilutive impact. KBC said it had decided not to pay a dividend for 2008, which would also mean no coupon paid on the newly issued securities. It also scrapped all executive bonuses this year. Chief Financial Officer Herman Agneessens told a conference call that KBC, or its predecessor Kredietbank, had always paid a dividend since setting up in 1935 and would prefer to continue doing so even if it would also therefore have to pay the coupon. NOT A RESCUE Both Finance Minister Didier Reynders and KBC Chief Executive Andre Bergen insisted at a news conference that KBC was not being rescued, unlike the other Belgian-based financial institutions bailed out. "It's the fourth operation in a few weeks, but here it's not about liquidity or solvency," Reynders said, adding the federal government had now set aside 19.9 billion euros for financial groups. Bergen said KBC's solvency position was very solid. But what had changed was market sentiment, particularly in the past week after ING got 10 billion euros from the Dutch government and French banks were offered state loans. "We are back again among the groups with the best capitalizations in Europe," Bergen said. The securities would be issued at 29.50 euros, likely by the end of November. The coupon would be the higher of 2.51 euros reflecting an 8.51 percent interest rate, or 110 percent of the 2009 dividend and 115 percent of the dividend from 2010. KBC can buy them back at 150 percent of the issue price. Agneessens said the state taking a stake in KBC was a "remote possibility," notably because it could use payments as revenue in a budget, but capital gains only to pay down debt. As part of the deal, the state has the right to nominate two members for KBC group's board of directors. KBC had said on Friday, when its shares crashed to a 12-year low, it would consider seeking state guarantees for its borrowing, but Bergen said it would not need to do so now. Earlier this month, KBC said it expected a third-quarter loss of up to 930 million euros after taking a 1.6 billion euro charge on credit assets. Banks operating in Belgium -- Fortis, Dexia, ING and new arrival BNP Paribas -- have all received some form of government support in the last few weeks. Belgian insurer Ethias, a Dexia shareholder, also received a 1.5 billion state rescue.
