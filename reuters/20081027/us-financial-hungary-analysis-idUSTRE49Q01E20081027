 BUDAPEST  (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund (IMF) says it has reached broad agreement on an economic rescue package for Hungary. 

 Analysts said the deal could boost sentiment in the short-term and may force the Hungarian government to implement further fiscal tightening and some structural measures to contain state spending. Hungary turned to the IMF for help in order to help shore up its falling currency and financial markets and shield the country from the global financial crisis. WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE DEAL? * The IMF and the Hungarian authorities, in close consultation with the European Union, have reached broad agreement on a set of policies to bolster the Hungarian economy's near-term stability and improve its long-term growth potential. The program will ensure fiscal sustainability and strengthen the financial sector, the IMF said. * A "substantial financing package" to support these policies will be announced when the program is finalized in the next few days, IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn said. * Participants will include the IMF, the EU and some individual European governments, together with regional and other multilateral institutions. * The IMF's assistance, in the form of a stand-by arrangement, will be considered by the IMF's executive board for approval. The IMF said the policies Hungary envisages justify "an exceptional level of access to Fund resources." * The size of the IMF package is not known yet. IS THE DEAL GOOD NEWS? * Analysts said the deal could boost market sentiment in the short term, and may help prevent further capital outflow. Istvan Zsoldos, analyst at Goldman Sachs in London: "Potentially this (package) could be on the large side, considering the Ukraine deal. It would probably boost sentiment in the short term." "There is a potential self-fulfilling element in all of these crises, because sentiment deteriorates, which induces further capital outflow, making financing even more difficult." "The IMF package would be an important tool to combat this self-fulfilling spiral." JPMorgan's Nora Szentivanyi in a note dated October 24: "The IMF has also agreed to provide help if needed, and we estimate that Hungary could borrow up to $12 billion from the fund under the supplementary reserve facility. Those funds, coupled with FX reserves of $23 billion, would be more than sufficient to cover Hungary's short-term external debt." WHY DOES HUNGARY NEED HELP? * Hungary is seen as one of the most vulnerable countries in eastern Europe to the global credit crunch due to its large debt, reliance on external financing and large-scale foreign exchange borrowing in the past few years, though analysts say its situation is in many aspects different from that of Iceland. * Earlier this month ratings agency Fitch cut Hungary's outlook to negative from stable, citing downside credit risks, shortly after Standard & Poor's put the country's credit ratings on review for a possible downgrade. * After a foreign currency lending boom, over half of bank lending to the private sector is in foreign currencies, and nearly 90 percent of all new household loans are in foreign currencies, mainly in Swiss francs and euros. Western European parent banks will likely reduce FX lending to their subsidiaries and several banks have already restricted or suspended FX lending as banks have difficulties in hedging these exposures in international money markets. * While the debt management agency has stressed the state's financing is secure for the rest of the year, Hungary will need to keep financing its large external debt and its deficit next year. * Excessive forint weakening would increase the loan repayments of households and may increase the risk of more Hungarians having difficulties with repayments. WHAT KEY MEASURES HAS HUNGARY TAKEN SO FAR? * The central bank hiked the benchmark base rate by 300 bps to 11.50 percent as of October 22 and made it clear that it was prepared to defend the forint * The central bank has signed a 5 billion euro FX swap line with the European Central Bank (ECB) * It has also launched auctions where it buys government bonds in order to boost the bond market * The government has announced additional fiscal tightening for 2008 and 2009 and said it had agreed with commercial banks about measures to shield FX borrowers from excessive forint weakening.
