 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp on Monday declined to comment on possible U.S. government aid for a merger between the No.1 U.S. automaker and smaller rival Chrysler LLC. 

 A spokeswoman said the automaker was looking at all options. The U.S. Treasury Department is considering how to best provide financial assistance to facilitate a possible merger between GM and Chrysler, a source familiar with the government's thinking told Reuters on Monday.
