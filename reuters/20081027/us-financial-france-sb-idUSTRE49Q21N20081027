 PARIS  (Reuters) - France will take more steps if the economic situation worsens, a close aide to President Nicolas Sarkozy was on Monday quoted as saying, adding that timely action would avert any repeat of past mistakes. 

 The comments by Henri Guaino for Les Echos newspaper came as global stock markets sank anew, with European indexes down around 5 percent and Japan's Nikkei average closing at its lowest in 26 years amid worries over banks and growth. "If the situation worsens, we will act," Guaino, one of Sarkozy's closest advisers said, without giving details. "The slowdown in activity is already there, it is being felt around the world because of economic and financial globalization," he said. "What we know is that by reacting quickly and strongly to the problem of bank liquidity, we avoided a depression of the type seen in the 1930s." Guaino pointed to Japan as a model to avoid given its tardy reaction to economic problems in the early 1990s which then spurred more than a decade of economic stagnation. "It is essential not to reproduce this error," he said. The return of confidence would be slow and would require profound changes in the world financial system, he added, saying that the upcoming G20 summit in Washington on November 15 - at which financial reforms will be discussed -- would be crucial.
