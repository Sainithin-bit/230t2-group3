 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Shares in blue-chip heavyweight HSBC ( 0005.HK ) plunged more than 10 percent to a six-year low on Monday, joining a global equities sell-off on fears of the impact of a global recession on corporate profits. 

 The stock fell HK$9 to HK$79. "It was a nightmare for HSBC to plunge below HK$80," said Francis Lun, general manager from Fulbright Securities. "A dive in Japanese and the mainland stocks triggered the sell-off in local stocks," he added. The blue-chip Hang Seng Index  .HSI  fell 8.6 percent in afternoon trade.
