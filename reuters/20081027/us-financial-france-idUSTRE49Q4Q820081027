 PARIS  (Reuters) - The Group of Seven is not planning to intervene to sell the yen after warning against the currency's excessive volatility, French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde said on Monday. 

 In an interview with Bloomberg News in Montpellier, France, Lagarde said: "The yen has over the past 48 hours seen brutal trading that reflects a great volatility that's linked to current market moves. "We wished to support this possible intervention of Japanese authorities knowing this would be about a purely Japanese intervention," she said of the statement. Asked specifically if the G7 would intervene to sell the yen, she said "no." (Writing by Anna Willard, editing by Mike Peacock)
