 (Reuters) - Fifteen U.S. banks have signed up for the government's offer of a cash injection, in addition to the nine that joined the program initially. The injections are a bid to revive the sector, which has suffered since lending has dried up and many loans have gone bad. 

 The U.S. Treasury Department plans to provide funds for 20 to 22 lenders in the current round of a $250 billion bank recapitalization program. Nine of the largest U.S. banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ) and Citigroup ( C.N ), received the first $125 billion of capital infusions two weeks ago. A list of the additional 15 banks that have announced they will use the government funds follows: PNC Financial Services Group Inc ( PNC.N ) $7.7 billion Capital One Financial Corp ( COF.N ) $3.55 billion Regions Financial Corp ( RF.N ) $3.5 billion SunTrust Banks Inc ( STI.N ) $3.5 billion KeyCorp ( KEY.N ) $2.5 billion Comerica ( CMA.N ) $2.25 billion State Street Corp ( STT.N ) $2.0 billion Northern Trust Corp ( NTRS.O ) $1.5 billion Huntington Bancshares ( HBAN.O ) $1.4 billion First Horizon National Corp ( FHN.N ) $866 million City National Corp ( CYN.N ) $395 million Valley National Bancorp ( VLY.N ) $330 million UCBH Holdings Inc UCBH.O $298 million Washington Federal WFSL.O $200 million First Niagara Financial Group ( FNFG.O ) $186 million NOTE: West Bancorp ( WTBA.O ) said on Friday it was seeking shareholder approval to raise between $12 million and $36 million under the Treasury program. Fifth Third Bancorp ( FITB.O ) said on Sunday it expected to receive Treasury approval for $3.4 billion. (Reporting by  Elinor Comlay ; editing by John Wallace)
