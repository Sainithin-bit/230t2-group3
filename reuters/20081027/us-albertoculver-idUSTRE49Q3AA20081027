 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Alberto Culver Co ACV.N said quarterly profit from continuing operations fell as its TRESemme hair care products sold well but results were weaker for the Nexxus and St. Ives brands. 

 Fiscal fourth-quarter profit from continuing operations was $20.2 million, or 20 cents per share, compared with $29.4 million, or 29 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding certain items, Alberto earned 31 cents per share, up from 26 cents a year earlier and in line with analysts' average forecast, according to Reuters Estimates. Analysts were focused on continuing operations since the company sold its Cederroth International business to Nordic private equity firm CapMan. Sales rose 7.3 percent to $386 million, topping analysts' average view of $379.25 million. Alberto Culver makes the less expensive Alberto VO5 line as well as higher-end products such as Nexxus. The company began selling Nexxus products at warehouse clubs in the prior year's fourth-quarter, so Nexxus faced a tough comparison in the most recent quarter. Alberto shares have fallen just 11.7 percent this year through Friday's close, outperforming the Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX , which has fallen nearly 40.3 percent.
