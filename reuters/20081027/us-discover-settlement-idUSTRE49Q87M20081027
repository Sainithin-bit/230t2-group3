 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Credit card companies MasterCard Inc ( MA.N ) and Visa Inc ( V.N ) said on Monday they have reached a $2.75 billion settlement in a lawsuit brought by Discover Financial Services ( DFS.N ) over allegations of anti- competitive practices. 

 Under the settlement agreement, Visa will pay $1.89 billion and MasterCard $862.5 million, the companies said in a statement. Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ), Discover's former parent company, will repay MasterCard $35 million and repay Visa $65 million, the companies said. MasterCard said it will make the payments in November and receive the payment from Morgan Stanley in the same month. MasterCard will take a net after-tax charge of $515.5 million in the third quarter of 2008, it said. MasterCard settled a similar lawsuit brought by American Express Co ( AXP.N ) in June for $1.8 billion. Visa settled that suit in November 2007 for about $2.1 billion.
