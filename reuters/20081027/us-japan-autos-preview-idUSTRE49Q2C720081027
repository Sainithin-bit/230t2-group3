 TOKYO  (Reuters) - With the yen soaring to historic heights and car demand crumbling under the threat of a global recession, Japanese carmakers will likely slash their profit forecasts for what had already shaped up as a weak year when they report interim results from this week. 

 In a matter of days, the market's latest projections for Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ), Honda Motor Co ( 7267.T ) and others have become outdated as the yen on Friday touched a 13-year high of 90.87 yen against the dollar, a six-year peak against the euro of 113.79 yen and unprecedented highs against other currencies. That compares with top automakers' exchange rate assumptions ranging from 100-105 yen for the dollar and 150-162 yen for the euro for the business year ending on March 31. Sensitivity to forex swings varies from company to company, but Toyota says its operating profit fluctuates 40 billion yen ($426.1 million) for every one-yen change in the dollar, swelling its potential forex losses to many billions of dollars. Even before the yen's latest run, local media had warned that operating profit would fall up to 50 percent at Toyota and Honda, Japan's top two automakers, this business year. An average forecast of 17 brokerages surveyed after September 1 put Toyota's 2008/09 operating profit at 1.34 trillion yen, far short of the company's projection of 1.6 trillion yen. Deepening economic woes have further clouded the outlook for car sales all over the world, including hitherto healthy markets such as China, India and Russia. "Right now, the sector is in a state of asphyxiation," UBS auto analyst Tatsuo Yoshida said. "You've got the credit crunch, which is hitting consumer sentiment and reducing showroom traffic. And the slowdown in Europe has only just begun." Honda will be the sector's first to report on Tuesday, but analysts expect Japan's No.2 automaker to be relatively unscathed thanks to resilient sales of its fuel-efficient cars, failing to set the tone for more pain expected at Toyota, Nissan Motor Co ( 7201.T ) and Suzuki Motor Corp ( 7269.T ). "We see Honda as the only company with a significant buffer to leave guidance unchanged, while we anticipate sizeable downward revisions at Toyota and Nissan," Deutsche Securities analyst Kurt Sanger wrote in a report last week. The fast-changing macroeconomy has turned investors' focus away from July-September results. The bleaker outlook for the full year -- now a foregone conclusion as credit woes spread from the United States to Europe, India and beyond -- has prompted short-term investors to flee Japanese car stocks in the past few months. Fears of prolonged yen strength further hammered auto stocks to multiyear lows on Monday, pushing the transport sector subindex .ITEQP.T down 9.1 percent. Toyota shed 8.1 percent to dip below 3,000 yen for the first time in five years. PAIN TO PERSIST IN 2009 With little chance of an economic recovery next year, many expect vehicle sales in the big U.S. and European markets to keep falling in 2009 and badger automakers' profits. "Given the severity of current economic conditions, we see (Japanese automakers') earnings falling 10 to 30 percent in 2009/10," Goldman Sachs analyst Kota Yuzawa wrote earlier this month. His calculations were based on a dollar rate of 100 yen and euro of 135 yen. PwC Automotive Institute last week projected U.S. industrywide vehicle sales at 13.1 million units in 2009, down almost 20 percent from last year. On the other hand, an economic slowdown has dragged down raw materials prices from their lofty heights, helping shave costs. But for this year, the declines will not matter much because companies have long-term contracts with steelmakers and hold an inventory of precious metals, analysts said. With no silver lining visible, a few analysts said Nissan, Japan's No.3 automaker, may retract its dividend targets. "Management has been clear that unless there are extreme conditions it intends to honor the dividend pledge," Deutsche's Sanger said, adding: "We see projected 2009 global GDP growth of 1.2 percent, a 100-yen dollar and tighter, more expensive credit markets as extreme conditions." He noted that the 44 yen dividend that Nissan has earmarked for 2009/10 would signify a payout ratio of 83 percent against his earnings-per-share forecast -- a level he said was "hard to justify" as being in the long-term interest of Nissan's shareholders. JPMorgan Securities analyst Takaki Nakanishi also called into question the 42 yen Nissan had promised for this year, forecasting 40 yen instead each for 2008/09 and 2009/10.
