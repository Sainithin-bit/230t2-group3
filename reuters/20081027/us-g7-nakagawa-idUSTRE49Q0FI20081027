 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japanese Finance Minister Shoichi Nakagawa said finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of Seven said in a joint statement on Monday they were concerned about excessive volatility in the yen and the possible adverse implications for economic and financial stability. 

 "We reaffirm a shared interest in a strong and stable international financial system," Nakagawa, reading from the G7 statement, told a news conference. "We continue to monitor markets closely and cooperate as appropriate," the statement said. Nakagawa said he was instructed by Prime Minister Taro Aso at a meeting earlier to take every possible step to stabilize markets and ensure smooth functioning of the financial system.
