 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Two activist investors in Dillard's Inc ( DDS.N ) are seeking the ouster of its family-led management, including Chief Executive William Dillard II, over the department store operator's consistently poor results. 

 Dillard's shares surged 31 percent in Monday morning trading. In an October 24 letter to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission released on Monday, hedge funds Barington Capital Group LP and Clinton Group Inc ask Dillard's to immediately search for a new CEO and replace other Dillard family members, saying they are "on the company's payroll regardless of their performance." "In our opinion, a management team with a comparable record of poor performance at any other company would have been fired long ago," the letter states. The hedge funds said most of the Dillard family members that work for the company are "overpaid and under-qualified for the positions they hold and can be readily replaced with more talented retailers." Dillard's has seen its financial results steadily weaken. Monthly same-store sales have fallen for much of the year. Dillard's September same-store sales of $568.5 million were down 12 percent, 3 percent of which it attributed to hurricane disruptions. The demands follow a warning from Moody's Investors Service on Friday that it may cut the struggling company's credit ratings further into junk territory, saying Dillard's weak performance is putting its financial profile at risk. Dillard's shares were up $1.04 to $4.38 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has shed nearly 80 percent of its value in the last year. OVERPAID? The hedge funds cite a May 2008 report by advisory firm Proxy Governance that says William Dillard II's average three-year compensation is 54 percent above the median paid to CEOs at peer companies. The average three-year compensation of the company's other executive officers is 185 percent above the median, according to the report. The report cites the average pay over the past three years for CEO William Dillard II as $5.3 million, President Alex Dillard as $4.9 million, and $2.9 million for executive vice president Mike Dillard. Barington and Clinton declined to comment on the letter. Dillard's did not immediately return calls for comment. Dillard's, which sells everything from clothes to Cuisinart appliances, avoided a proxy fight with the two funds in April by agreeing to nominate four candidates to the board of directors. All the candidates had retail experience. In September, the hedge funds asked Dillard's to scrap a dual-class share structure that entrenches control of the company with the Dillard family, which founded the company. The hedge funds, which together own 5.67 percent of Dillard's class A stock, say they were recently informed that the Dillard family told its board it has no intention of selling its class B shares. The hedge funds said in their letter to Dillard's that the decision not to sell the stock shouldn't be made "on the belief that their long-standing control of the Class B shares will continue to provide them with the ability to have all interested family members remain on the Company's payroll regardless of their performance." In 1969, when the company went public, founder William Dillard established two classes of stock to ensure that the family remained in control. The dual-share structure creates a strong defense against a takeover, but also keeps its stock from being widely traded. Barington Capital has been calling on the Little Rock, Arkansas, retailer to take steps to improve financial results and governance practices since at least June 2007. On October 23, Dillard's Chief Financial Officer James Freeman purchased 200,000 Class A shares at a price of $3.8976 each and President Alex Dillard purchased 100,000 Class A shares at $3.93 each, according to a filing.
