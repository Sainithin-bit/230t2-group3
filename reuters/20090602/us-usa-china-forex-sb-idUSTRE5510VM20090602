 BEIJING  (Reuters) - China is playing a constructive role in the global economy and is committed to moving toward a market-driven, flexible foreign exchange policy, U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said on Tuesday. 

 In an interview with CNBC, Geithner also said that China supported increased funding for the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Geithner, on the second day of a two-day visit, declined to comment on the level of China's yuan. He added that market fears of global deflation were easing.
