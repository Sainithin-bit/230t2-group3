 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - World stocks faltered and the U.S. dollar fell on Tuesday to its lowest level this year versus the euro and other currencies after a report showing a jump in U.S. pending home sales bolstered the belief the global economy is on the mend. 

 U.S. and European shares pared gains to trade flat in a sell-off of financial shares, while U.S. Treasury bond prices see-sawed in line with stocks. Oil prices fell on profit-taking a day after jumping to a fresh seven-month high, while world equity markets struggled to hold onto their 2009 high seen on Monday. "At some stage the market has got to consolidate and pull back. We had a very big run-up yesterday," said David Morrison, market strategist at GFT Global Markets in London. U.S. pending home sales, based on contracts signed in April, rose 6.7 percent in the latest data that buttressed views the U.S. recession is easing. Analysts had forecast a 0.5 percent rise. The National Association of Realtors said its Pending Home Sales Index rose to 90.3 from 84.6 in March, taking the index 3.2 percent above its year-ago level. "The collapse of the housing market was the catalyst for the financial crisis, so this stronger number will add to the increased optimism that is flowing through the stock markets at the moment," Morrison said. Shares of home builders rose on the data, with the Dow Jones U.S. Home Construction index .DJUSHB adding 2.3 percent and the SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF ( XHB.P ) gaining 2.8 percent. But declining financial shares limited gains on Wall Street, after several companies, including Dow components JP Morgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ) and American Express Co ( AXP.N ), said they will sell new stock as they attempt to raise capital to repay money received under the government's bailout plan. JPMorgan fell 3.4 percent and AmEx fell 5.2 percent. The equity offerings would be dilutive to shareholders, decreasing their percentage ownership stake in the company. At 1 p.m. (1700 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was up 6.19 points, or 0.07 percent, at 8,727.63. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was up 0.31 points, or 0.03 percent, at 943.18. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was up 3.74 points, or 0.20 percent, at 1,832.42. In Europe stronger auto shares struggled to negate the impact of weaker banks, which were led lower by Barclays after Abu Dhabi sold more than 11 percent of the lender's shares. The FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of top European shares closed down 0.39 points at 885.88. The index has jumped 37 percent since hitting a lifetime low in early March. Barclays ( BARC.L ) slipped 13.5 percent after Abu Dhabi's International Petroleum Investment Co sold a stake in the bank, reaping a $2.5 billion profit in just seven months. "There is some profit taking, but equally there are pockets in the market where you have got fairly sharp appreciation going on," said Jonathan Lawlor, head of European research at Fox-Pitt, Kelton. In the oil markets investors also sold contracts to lock in profits from Monday's price jump, but prices creeped higher in early afternoon trade. "There was a huge jump in prices in the past couple of days so we are seeing profit-taking now. There are some technical indices showing the market has been overbought," said Andy Sommer, an oil analyst with EGL AG in Switzerland. Oil has moved up steeply from lows below $33 in December. U.S. light sweet crude oil was up 8 cents to $68.66 a barrel. Gold also edged higher as the dollar fell to 5-1/2 month lows. Spot gold prices rose $6.45 to $980.65 an ounce. The dollar recovered some of Monday's losses earlier in the global trading day, but those gains later eroded. The dollar was down against a basket of major currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index .DXY down 0.78 percent at 78.56. The euro rose 0.87 percent at $1.4287, and against the yen, the dollar was down 0.81 percent at 95.78. U.S. Treasury debt fell. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was down 3/32 in price to yield 3.69 percent. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond was down 2/32 in price to yield 4.54 percent. Improving global manufacturing data lifted Asian shares overnight near levels before the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September, but the pace of gains slowed as investors pondered how much longer a heady three-month rally will last. Japan's Nikkei stock average  .N225  closed up 0.3 percent, and MSCI's index of Asian stocks outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS rose 0.5 percent.
