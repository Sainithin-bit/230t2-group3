 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Diversified U.S. manufacturer Honeywell International Inc ( HON.N ) said on Tuesday it had landed a contract worth up to $700 million over 10 years to provide logistical services to the U.S. Marine Corps. 

 The Morristown, New Jersey-based company's Honeywell Technology Solutions Inc unit will handle maintenance and supplies for 14 ships that serve 15,000 Marines. Honeywell, which is the world's largest maker of cockpit electronics and also produces heating and cooling systems for large buildings, last year earned $2.79 billion on $36.56 billion in revenue. Analysts expect its profit to fall about 24 percent this year as the recession takes a toll on its sales in the United States and Europe. The company has said longer term service contracts will be key to sustaining its business at a time when customers are cutting back spending on new aircraft and in the commercial construction market. Honeywell shares are down about 41 percent over the past year, roughly in line with the 43 percent decline of the Standard & Poor's capital goods industry index .GSPIC.
