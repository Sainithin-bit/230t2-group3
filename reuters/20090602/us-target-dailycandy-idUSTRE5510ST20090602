 (Reuters) - Target Corp, the No. 2 U.S. discount retailer, plans to announce a partnership with Comcast Corp's free daily e-mail newsletter and website DailyCandy.com on Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal reported. 

 The partnership, named Red Hot Shop, will feature products from up and coming designers selected by DailyCandy editors, along with articles and artwork by the DailyCandy team, the paper said. The venture is a part of a broader ad deal in which Target is paying to advertise with DailyCandy and neither side disclosed the value of the deal, the paper added. DailyCandy's "unique and quirky writing style is something they are known for, and we want Red Hot Shop to have a larger focus on editorial, compared to the rest of Target.com," Kelly Basgen, a Target spokeswoman, told the paper. Target was not immediately available for comment to Reuters outside regular business hours. (Reporting by  Esha Dey  in Bangalore; Editing by  Anshuman Daga )
