 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Clinton-era Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Arthur Levitt has signed on as an advisor to Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ), the Wall Street firm announced on Tuesday. 

 Levitt will provide Goldman with strategic advice in a number of areas, namely public policy, the company announced. Levitt was the longest-serving chairman of the SEC, having led the commission from 1993 until 2001. The appointment adds to a history of ties between Goldman and the upper echelons of the U.S. government. Former U.S. Treasury Secretaries Hank Paulson and Robert Rubin were both Goldman alumni as was Assistant Treasury Secretary Neel Kashkari, who oversaw the Troubled Asset Relief Program devised by Paulson.
