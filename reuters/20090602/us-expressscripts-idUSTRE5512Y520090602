 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Express Scripts Inc ( ESRX.O ) launched a public offering of 23 million shares on Tuesday as it moves to pay WellPoint Inc ( WLP.N ) entirely in cash for its acquisition of the health insurer's drug benefits unit. 

 The large U.S. pharmacy benefit manager, which announced its deal with WellPoint in April, had the option to use stock to fund $1.4 billion of the $4.68 billion acquisition. But Express Scripts said on Tuesday it intends to use the proceeds of the equity offering to pay that portion in cash. Express Scripts estimated proceeds from the offering would be $1.4 billion, or $1.6 billion if underwriters fully exercise their over-allotment option. The 23 million shares represent more than 9 percent of the company's shares outstanding as of the end of March. "We think it gives us better control of our distribution," Express Scripts spokeswoman Alison Fetsch said in explaining the decision to pursue a public offering. Fetsch said the company will now start a road show to draw potential long-term investors. Jefferies & Co analyst Arthur Henderson said the offering was a better option for Express Scripts than selling the stock all to WellPoint. "It's just a more orderly market," Henderson said. "I would much rather have my stock in a bunch of different hands rather than in one hand." With WellPoint's NextRx business, Express Scripts stands to become the No. 2 U.S. pharmacy benefit manager, gaining clout in driving down drug prices. The deal is expected to close late in the third quarter or in the fourth quarter, after the St. Louis-based company said last week it cleared an antitrust hurdle. J.P. Morgan Securities Inc, Credit Suisse Securities LLC and Citigroup Global Markets Inc are acting as bookrunning managers for the stock offering. Express Scripts said it also intends to offer senior notes "of a benchmark size" in the near term to help pay for the deal. Express Scripts shares fell 44 cents, or 0.68 percent, to $64.01 in late morning trading on the Nasdaq. Through Monday, the shares had risen 17 percent this year.
