 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Walgreen Co ( WAG.N ) said on Tuesday that sales at stores open at least a year rose 1 percent, missing analysts expectations, with weaker-than-expected sales at its pharmacy counters. 

 May same-store sales rose 1 percent, while analysts had expected a 2.2 percent rise, according to an average forecast compiled by Thomson Reuters. Pharmacy same-store sales rose just 1.5 percent, feeling the impact of lower-priced generic drug introductions and one fewer weekday for consumers to fill prescriptions. Analysts, on average, had expected a 3.5 percent rise. Same-store sales of general merchandise rose 0.2 percent, topping analysts' expectations for a 0.2 percent decline. Total May sales rose 6.1 percent to $5.37 billion. Walgreen said it had 6,857 drugstores as of May 31, 605 more than a year before. (Reporting by  Jessica Wohl , editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
