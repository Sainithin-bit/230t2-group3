 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Wireless technology firm InterDigital ( IDCC.O ) and the world's top cellphone maker Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ) wrapped up hearings on Tuesday at the International Trade Commission in a battle over four patents, said InterDigital spokesman Jack Indekeu. 

 InterDigital filed the suit in 2007, accusing Nokia of infringing four patents for 3G mobile handsets. Three of the patents relate to power management while a fourth helps wireless devices route data. The ITC judge hearing the case is expected to rule on or before August 14. "InterDigital remains very confident that we had an opportunity to present our position, which reflects the strength and the validity of the 3G patent portfolio," said Indekeu. "We're looking forward to the court's decision and securing appropriate relief." Indekeu declined to say how much monetary relief InterDigital was seeking. Lawyers for Nokia did not immediately return telephone calls. Pennsylvania-based Interdigital had filed a similar lawsuit at the ITC with Samsung, which was settled for $400 million in November 2008. Interdigital is seeking to have Nokia cellular telephones with the patented technology barred from importation into the United States. The ITC is a popular venue for patent disputes because it can prohibit infringing devices from entering the United States. (Reporting by Diane Bartz; Editing Bernard Orr)
