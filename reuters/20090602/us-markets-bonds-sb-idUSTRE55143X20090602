 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury debt prices turned negative on Tuesday, paring early gains after data showed a larger-than-expected rise in April pending home sales. 

 Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes were trading 9/32 lower in price for a yield of 3.70 percent, up from 3.68 percent late on Monday, while the 30-year bond was trading 10/32 lower in price for a yield of 4.54 percent from 4.54 percent. (Reporting by  Chris Reese ; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
