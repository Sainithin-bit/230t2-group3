 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan Airlines Co Ltd President Yoshihiro Ueki said on Monday that Boeing's 787 Dreamliner, which has been grounded worldwide after two battery incidents, should stay at the centre of its fleet strategy. 
 "It's a shame about the battery, but it is a wonderful aircraft," Ueki said. (Reporting by Tim Kelly; Editing by  Michael Urquhart )
