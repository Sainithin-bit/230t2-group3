 BARI  (Reuters) - Italian prosecutors in the town of Trani are investigating five foreign banks for possible manipulation of Euribor, the euro-priced counterpart of scandal-hit Libor bank-to-bank lending rates, court sources said on Monday. 
 The banks are Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ), Barclays ( BARC.L ), Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ), HSBC and Societe Generale ( SOGN.PA ), the court sources said. The probe was opened in July after complaints from consumer groups. It was not immediately possible to reach the banks for comment.
