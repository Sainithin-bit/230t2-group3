 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers agreed on Thursday to give the Securities and Exchange Commission authority to impose fiduciary duties on broker-dealers who provide financial advice. 

 Lawmakers hashing out a financial regulation bill said the SEC would get this authority after conducting a six-month study on the issue. The House and Senate hope to merge their bills this week so they can send a final version of the regulatory overhaul to President Barack Obama to sign into law by early July.
