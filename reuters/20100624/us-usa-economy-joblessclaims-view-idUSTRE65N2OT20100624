 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The number of U.S. workers filing new applications for unemployment insurance fell slightly more than expected last week, offering hope the fragile economic recovery remained intact 

 New orders for long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods fell for the first time in six months in May but the drop was less than expected, a government report showed on Thursday. KEY POINTS: JOBLESS CLAIMS: * Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 19,000 to a seasonally adjusted 457,000 in the week ended June 19, the Labor Department said on Thursday. * The decline in claims was the largest since the week ended April 17. * Analysts polled by Reuters had expected claims to fall to 460,000 from the previously reported 472,000, which was revised up to 476,000 in Thursday's report. * The four-week moving average of new claims, considered a better measure of underlying labor market trends, fell 1,500 to 462,750. * The number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid fell 45,000 to 4.55 million in the week ended June 12, the Labor Department said. * The level was in line with market expectations for 4.56 million. DURABLE GOODS: * Durable goods orders fell 1.1 percent, the sharpest drop since August 2009, the Commerce Department said. * Analysts were expecting a 1.4 percent decline after a 3 percent gain in April COMMENTS: JUSTIN HOOGENDOORN, FIXED INCOME STRATEGIST, BMO CAPITAL MARKETS, CHICAGO: "The jobless claims and durable goods data came in a little better than expected, but they are really non-events. I think these numbers pale in comparison to the new home sales number yesterday. "People are trying to find the positives. They are looking for reasons that we can grow out of this and trying to move money out of fixed-income into higher returning equities." PETER BOOCKVAR, EQUITY STRATEGIST, MILLER TABAK & CO, NEW YORK: "May Durable Goods fell 1.1 percent, a touch better than the expected drop of 1.4 percent but excluding transports were a touch light, as it rose 0.9 percent versus the forecast of 1 percent. Bottom line, notwithstanding the headline numbers where a 30 percent drop in aircraft sent it lower, capital spending still remains pretty good and manufacturing has been the beneficiary. We should be thankful for the strong balance sheets of corporate America and hope they continue to invest." MATTHEW STRAUSS, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, TORONTO: "Durable goods data is largely in line with expectations and given the volatility of the month-on-month data, it's actually amazing that it's so close to expectations. Initial jobless claims came in slightly better than expected. Overall, the data is not providing any direction to the market." SCOTT BROWN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, RAYMOND JAMES & ASSOCIATES, ST PETERSBURG, FLORIDA: "The (claims and durables) numbers were pretty close to expectations. We are still seeing jobless claims running at a moderately high level at this point. Normally we would expect to see them dropping down as the economy recovers. "The durable orders figures tend to jump around a lot. "Most of the other data we are seeing suggests that the pace of growth has slowed somewhat. It is still unlikely we will see a double dip recession, but the downside risks to the economy have increased versus a couple of months ago." STEVE GOLDMAN, MARKET STRATEGIST, WEEDEN & CO., GREENWICH CONNECTICUT: "The margin's slightly better than expected, it takes away some concern at the margin. "The market was vastly oversold, and over the past two weeks we really have retraced half those losses, but the numbers may still add up to a listless environment. "It's not likely to put any further pressures on what we've seen. We don't have a catalyst to move higher just yet, we're still in a fragile economy, but this probably isn't evidence of a double-dip recession." ALAN RUSKIN, CHIEF INTERNATIONAL STRATEGIST, RBS SECURITIES, STAMFORD, CONNECTICUT: "It puts paid to the idea that the claims data is deteriorating. It looks to me something like a sideways trend. The claims in general tend to understate improvements in non-farm payrolls anyway, so it negates some of the concerns. On durable goods, the focus is really just on the capital goods non-defense, which is still decent and consistent in my mind with relatively robust investment and manufacturing. All in all, positive for risk, but only mildly so." TOM PORCELLI, SENIOR MARKET ECONOMIST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, NEW YORK: DURABLE GOODS: "My first reaction was this number was shockingly in line with expectations. This number is so volatile it's always a surprise when consensus nails it. "The increase basically just unwinds some of the decline for the previous month. "Manufacturing activity continues to move along but without any continued improvement in final sales it's going to be difficult to maintain this level of factory activity. JOBLESS CLAIMS: "There's a disconnect between the fact that we've seen private payrolls post gains for the last five months and the fact that continuing claims remain stubbornly high. We expect that that disconnect has to at some point be resolved." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stock index futures pare losses after jobless claims fall in latest week. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices trim gains. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar pares gains versus euro.
