 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - New orders for long-lasting manufactured goods fell for the first time in six months in May but the drop was less than expected, a government report showed on Thursday. 

 Durable goods orders fell 1.1 percent, the sharpest drop since August 2009, the Commerce Department said. Analysts were expecting a 1.4 percent decline after a 3 percent gain in April. (Reporting by  Mark Felsenthal ; Editing by  Padraic Cassidy )
