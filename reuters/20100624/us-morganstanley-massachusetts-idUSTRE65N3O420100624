 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) has agreed to pay $102 million to settle an investigation in Massachusetts into the investment bank's subprime lending practices, a source familiar with the matter said on Thursday. 

 Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley's office will announce details about the settlement at a news conference at 1 p.m. Coakley has aggressively pursued Wall Street firms for their lending practices in the state. Earlier this year, the state was part of a group that won a $310 million settlement against State Street ( STT.N ). A year ago, Massachusetts settled with Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) for $60 million.
