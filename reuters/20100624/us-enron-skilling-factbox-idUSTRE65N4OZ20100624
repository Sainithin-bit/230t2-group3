 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday sent former Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling's criminal case back to an appellate court to argue a critical point that could win him a new trial or set him free from prison. 

 Here are five facts about Skilling: * Skilling, 56, was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and grew up in a middle-class home in suburban Chicago, the son of a valve salesman. A graduate of Southern Methodist University, he told a Harvard Business School interviewer who asked him if he was smart that he was (expletive) smart. He was accepted into Harvard's masters of business administration program. * After Harvard, Skilling joined consultancy McKinsey & Co., where he quickly rose to partner in its chemical and energy practice. Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay, an early proponent of natural gas deregulation, was impressed with Skilling's ideas about creating a "gas bank" where Enron would match natural gas buyers and sellers and lock in profits as the middleman handling the trades. Lay recruited Skilling to Enron in 1990 to put that idea to work. * Skilling ran several divisions at Enron throughout the 1990s, pushing to expand Enron's trading operation into the largest natural gas and electricity wholesaler in the United States. He became chief operating officer in 1997, succeeded Lay as CEO in early 2001, and abruptly quit the company in August that year, less than four months before Enron collapsed. * Skilling was pudgy in his early days at Enron, but slimmed down and developed a liking for extreme sports. But he acknowledged that he never lost his liking for junk food -- Arby's roast beef sandwiches in particular. * Skilling had little tolerance for questions about Enron's murky accounting and financial disclosures. In April 2001 he called an analyst an "asshole" on a quarterly earnings conference call when the analyst complained that Enron didn't release financial statements with earnings.
