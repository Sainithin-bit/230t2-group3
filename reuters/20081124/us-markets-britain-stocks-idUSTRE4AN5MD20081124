 LONDON  (Reuters) - Britain's top share index posted its biggest-ever one-day percentage rise on Monday, surging 9.8 percent, led by rallies in commodities and banks, and helped by a tax give-away UK pre-budget report. The FTSE 100 index ended 372 points higher at 4,152.96, the day's peak, having bounced from a low of 3,780.96. 

 "At current levels, global markets have rallied between 5 and 10 percent since the lows on Thursday," said David Evans, market analyst at BetOnMarkets.com. "Although welcome, traders are not holding their breath that this marks the start of a rally from the recent lows," he said. "A 5 percent move could be erased within the space of a few hours if markets continue their record volatility streak." Banks were among the standout FTSE gainers in London, with Royal Bank of Scotland up 7.2 percent and HSBC ahead 3.8 percent, after the U.S. government agreed to inject $20 billion into Citigroup to avoid a collapse that could have wrought financial havoc around the globe. Citigroup shares leapt nearly 60 percent higher on the news, erasing last week's plunge, with U.S. blue chips jumping 3.5 percent higher in response, extending Friday's leap. "Had Citigroup gone under, that would have knocked Lehmans into a cocked hat," said Jeremy Batstone-Carr, head of private client research at Charles Stanley. In the UK, Barclays rose 10 percent as its investors voted in favor of the bank's controversial 7 billion pounds fundraising, its chairman Marcus Agius said at a meeting called to vote on the plan. Lloyds TSB gained 18.4 percent and HBOS rose 17.3 percent. Lloyds has started to look for potential buyers for HBOS's equity stakes in a range of British businesses from coffee shops to gyms, the Daily Telegraph reported. Standard Chartered missed out on the sector rally, shedding 4.5 percent after it announced a 1.8 billion pounds ($2.69 billion) rights issue it said would strengthen its balance sheet and give it the flexibility to take advantage of opportunities in the turbulent markets. Among other financial issues, insurers also recovered after recent hefty falls as equity valuations rose, with Prudential up 20.4 percent, Aviva ahead 9.1 percent, and Legal & General up 9.5 percent. MINERS, OILS PROVIDE BOOST Miners forged higher, with Kazakhmys, ENRC, Xstrata, and BHP Billiton adding between 22.9 percent and 27.8 percent, reflecting a recovery by commodity prices. Energy shares also rebounded, with BP, Royal Dutch Shell, and BG Group up between 7.4 percent and 11 percent as crude rallied 8.5 percent to more than $54 a barrel. Retailers got a boost from confirmation in the pre-budget report of a temporary cut in Value Added Tax to 15 percent, with Marks & Spencer, Kingfisher, and Next up between 6.8-9.9 percent, while supermarket chains Tesco and J.Sainsbury added 4.9 percent and 7.8 percent respectively. Airline issues also got a pre-budget report lift from planned air passenger duty changes, with British Airways up 8.1 percent and easyJet ahead 3.9 percent. "We have entered the Alistair in Wonderland arena of public finances," said Felix Riley, Head of Binaries at ChoiceOdds. "We are in unchartered waters with about as much security as an oil tanker off the Horn of Africa." (Additional reporting by  Rebekah Curtis ; Editing by Andrew Macdonald)
