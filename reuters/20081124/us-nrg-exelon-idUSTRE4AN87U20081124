 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - NRG Energy Inc ( NRG.N ) rejected Exelon Corp's ( EXC.N ) $6 billion-plus takeover bid for the second time on Monday, saying the offer is too low. 

 The company also recommended that shareholders not tender their shares to Exelon. The rejection by NRG Energy's board of directors came nearly two weeks after Exelon took its offer directly to NRG Energy shareholders by launching an exchange offer for all the company's outstanding shares. "The board of directors is unanimous in its belief that the Exelon offer is inadequate, dilutive, significantly undervalues NRG and does not fully reflect the fundamental value of NRG's assets, operations and strategic plan," NRG Chairman Howard Cosgrove said in a statement. Princeton, New Jersey-based NRG Energy first rebuffed Exelon on November 9, two days before Exelon launched its exchange offer. Exelon is offering 0.485 of its shares for each NRG share. NRG shares rose 10.5 percent to close at $21 on the New York Stock Exchange. Exelon's stock rose 6.2 percent to close at $53.11, also on the NYSE.
