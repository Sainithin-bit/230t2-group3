 LONDON  (Reuters) - The cost of protecting Citigroup Inc's debt with credit default swaps fell on Monday after the U.S. government agreed a bailout plan for the bank. 

 Five-year CDS on Citigroup tightened by 19 basis points to 481.75 basis points, or $481,750 a year to protect $10 million of debt, according to data from CMA DataVision. Under the deal the U.S. government will shoulder most of Citi's potential losses on $306 billion of high-risk assets, inject $20 billion of new capital on top of $25 billion it just put into the bank, and receive preferred shares with an 8 percent dividend.
