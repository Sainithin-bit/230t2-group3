 BOSTON  (Reuters) - King Pharmaceuticals Inc KG.N said on Monday it has agreed to acquire Alpharma Inc ALO.N for about $1.6 billion, ending a fractious takeover tussle and expanding King's presence in the market for pain drugs. 

 King's offer of $37 a share has been accepted by Alpharma's board and represents a premium of 10.4 percent over Alpharma's closing share price on Friday of $33.50. Alpharma shares jumped 7.28 percent, while King rose 9.05 percent late Monday afternoon. The agreement, if approved by shareholders, will give King Alpharma's pain drug Kadian and pain patch Flector, in addition to drugs to treat animals. It also gives King Alpharma's experimental pain drug Embeda, which, together with its own experimental pain drug Remoxy, could boost its competitiveness in the race to discover painkillers that cannot be abused. "We believe this deal is a no-brainer for King, as it not only provides increased revenue diversification with the animal health cash-cow, but more importantly positions King to be the leading company in the promising abuse-deterrent opioid market," said Corey Davis, an analyst at Natixis Bleichroeder. DRUG DEALS GETTING DONE The deal comes as drugmakers try to take advantage of the credit crunch and the declining values of many smaller companies -- particularly biotechnology companies. Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ.N ) announced on Monday it has agreed to acquire Israel's Omrix Biopharmaceuticals OMRI.O for about $438 million in cash to expand its line of products used to control bleeding during surgery. The $25-per-share deal represents a 18.1 percent premium to Omrix' Friday close of $21.16 on the New York Stock Exchange. "The Omrix acquisition is small ... but could signal a more aggressive JNJ on the acquisition front, particularly as valuations continue to contract in this market environment," Leerink Swann analyst Rick Wise said in a note to clients. Alpharma's morphine-based Embeda is somewhat less attractive to drug abusers, a potential marketing boon if the agency allows the company to include such a claim on its label, an advisory panel to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said earlier this month. The FDA is also weighing whether to approve Remoxy, a similar product from King and partner Pain Therapeutics Inc ( PTIE.O ). The advisory panel said Remoxy also appeared less susceptible to abuse than other similar drugs such as Purdue Pharma's Oxycontin. Bristol, Tennessee-based King, which makes the blood pressure drug Altace and muscle relaxant Skelaxin, originally offered $33 a share for Alpharma, but later sweetened the bid after Alpharma resisted. The $37 a share offer represents a premium of 54 percent over Alpharma's closing price of $24.04 the day before King's first offer on August 22. King generated revenue of $2.7 billion last year, while Alpharma, based in Bridgewater, New Jersey, had revenue of $722 million. King has more than $1.2 billion in cash, while Alpharma has $600 million in cash and $300 million in debt. King said it expects earnings per share, excluding one-time items, to increase in the second full year after the transaction closes. It expects the deal to be completed by the end of this year. King estimated cost savings of $50 million to $70 million over the same period, mainly derived from general and administrative cost cuts and research and development savings achieved by avoiding the expense of new sales representatives for the launch of their new pain drug. Credit Suisse and Wachovia Securities are acting as financial advisers to King. Banc of America Securities LLC is advising Alpharma. On the New York Stock Exchange, Alpharma rose $2.44, or 7.28 percent, to $35.94 late Monday afternoon, while King rose 78 cents, or 9.05 percent, to $9.40, off an earlier high of $9.61. Omrix makes protein-based products used in bleeding control, or hemostasis, and other treatments for immune deficiencies and infectious diseases. Oppenheimer analysts have estimated the fast-growing market for hemostasis products could reach $1 billion by 2010. Shares of Omrix rose $3.58, or 16.92 percent, to $24.74 on Nasdaq. J&J shares rose 36 cents, or 0.62 percent, to $58.71 on the NYSE. (Reporting by Toni Clarke, Susan Kelly, editing by Dave Zimmerman,  Matthew Lewis ,  Richard Chang )
