 LONDON  (Reuters) - European shares raced higher on Monday, as Washington's move to rescue banking giant Citigroup and the UK government's measures to help the economy boosted sentiment and lifted commodities and banking stocks. 

 The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares bounced back to provisionally close 8.6 percent higher at 826.69 points. It lost 11.5 percent last week to finish at its lowest level in 5-1/2 years. The benchmark has fallen about 45 percent this year, hurt by the financial sector crisis and the prospect of a deep global recession. "The rescue of Citigroup, which provided a huge amount of uncertainty last week, hopes that Barack Obama can put the right team together to deal with the economic turmoil and expectations of a stimulus package from the UK are helping the markets to bounce back," said Barclays Stockbrokers strategist Henk Potts. "In the short term, equities are still expected to remain volatile. The reality is economic growth is slowing down and corporate profitability is under pressure." Miners tracked higher metals prices. BHP Billiton, Anglo American, Vedanta Resources, Lonmin, Kazakhmys, Xstrata, Antofagasta and Rio Tinto spiked between 13 and 28 percent. A 7.7 percent jump in crude prices helped energy stocks. BP, Royal Dutch Shell, gas producer BG Group and Tullow Oil added between 7.4 and 13.5 percent. Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100, Germany's DAX and France's CAC-40 were up between 9.8 percent and 10.5 percent.
