 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) shareholders are set to vote on Tuesday on proposals concerned with how investors vote for board members and how executives are paid when financial results are restated. 

 The proposals are both non-binding, but their authors bet that winning support from shareholders at the annual meeting on Tuesday will send a message of investor unrest to management as GM continues to fight for market share. The automaker is undergoing a massive restructuring to cut costs amid stepped up competition from Asian rivals. One proposal would allow investors to multiply the number of shares they own by the number of board candidates, and cast that greater number of votes for just one person. Last year, when it was put forth by shareholder John Chevedden, the proposal received 54 percent of votes in favor. "We would like more of a say on who gets on that board," John Lauve, a GM shareholder from Holly, Michigan, said in an interview. A second proposal would call for management bonuses to be recouped when financial results are restated downwards. Lauve said GM currently only recalled the bonus of the person responsible for the restatement. "But we want a policy that recoups bonuses from everyone who was awarded one because of the inflated results," he said. GM, which pledged to tighten its financial controls after twice restating results and delaying its fourth-quarter report, said last month U.S. securities regulators were reviewing its accounting for foreign exchange and commodity derivatives and that a similar hedge-related probe into its former finance arm could force it to restate results again. GM filed its annual report in March after a six-week delay, which it blamed on recurring accounting problems, and said its internal controls on financial reporting had been ineffective. Another proposal, from the Connecticut State Treasurer's office and more than a dozen members of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility -- an association of 275 faith-based institutional investors, calls for GM to set greenhouse gas reduction goals for its operations and vehicles, and report back by September 30 on plans for achieving the goals. The proposal comes as GM launches an advertising campaign against legislative proposals to raise fuel economy standards. KERKORIAN EFFECT Last February, GM cut its dividend by half due to pressure from Jerry York, aide to billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian, then GM's top shareholder. York was also given a board seat. "We would certainly like to see more of a dividend," said Lauve, 66, who worked at GM for 30 years and retired in 1999. Kerkorian subsequently sold all his GM shares and York stepped down from the board after failing in an effort to forge an alliance between GM and Nissan-Renault ( 7201.T ) ( RENA.PA ). GM's shares, which lost half their value in 2005, rose 58 percent last year, the most of any company in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. They are down about 2 percent this year. The automaker, which is in the middle of a restructuring that includes slashing more than 34,000 jobs and closing 12 plants, cut $9 billion of its structural costs in 2006.
