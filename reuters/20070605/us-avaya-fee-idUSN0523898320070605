 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Telecommunications equipment company Avaya Inc. ( AV.N ) agreed to pay either $80 million or $250 million if it backs out of an agreement to be bought by private equity firms TPG Capital and Silver Lake, according to a regulatory filing on Tuesday. 

 The $8.2 billion deal, announced on Monday, is expected to be completed in the fall of 2007, subject to approval by shareholders and regulators. The break-up fee is $80 million if Avaya decides to accept a superior proposal that is submitted by another party in the next 50 days. Otherwise, the fee is $250 million, Avaya said in a filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Under the terms of the agreement, Ayaya cannot solicit proposals from additional third parties after July 24, though it can continue to discussions with any party that submits a written takeover proposal within the 50 days. Media reports have previously mentioned Canadian rival Nortel Networks Corp. NT.TO as another suitor. Avaya's small size compared with rivals like Cisco Systems Inc. ( CSCO.O ) has long made the company a subject of takeover speculation. Such talk intensified late last month after Avaya postponed an investor conference. Its shares rose 2.3 percent to $17.10 in premarket trading on Tuesday, from their close of $16.72 on the New York Stock Exchange Monday. TPG and Silver Lake agreed to pay $17.50 per share for Avaya.
