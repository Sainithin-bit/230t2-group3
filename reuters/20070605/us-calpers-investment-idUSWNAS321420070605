 BOSTON  (Reuters) - The California Public Employees' Retirement System said on Tuesday it will invest $700 million to help drive down the price of health-care coverage. 

 Calpers, the largest U.S. pension fund and third-largest U.S. purchaser of health care, said it has earmarked up to $500 million for coinvestments and direct investments in health-care companies and up to $200 million for health care-focused private equity funds. "This initiative represents a significant opportunity to leverage our twin roles as a leading health benefits purchaser and investor to bolster our market returns while addressing severe inefficiencies in the healthcare sector," Rob Feckner, Calpers Board President, said in a statement.
