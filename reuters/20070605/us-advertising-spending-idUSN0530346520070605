 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co. ( PG.N ), AT&T Inc. ( T.N ) and General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ), three of the largest U.S. marketers, cut their advertising budgets in the first quarter, part of an overall decline in ad spending during the period, a report showed on Tuesday. 

 TNS Media Intelligence, which tracks ad expenditures, reported that the top 10 advertisers in the first quarter spent a combined $4.36 billion, an 8 percent drop from the same period a year ago. Other big advertisers cutting budgets included Time Warner Inc. ( TWX.N ) and Walt Disney Co. ( DIS.N ), as both spent less to market new movies, the report said. Steven Fredericks, chief executive of TNS Media Intelligence, blamed part of the broad spending decline on tough comparisons, since the Olympics helped pump up spending in the first quarter of 2006. "However, after factoring out the incremental contribution of special events, it is apparent that core growth rates have slowed further from last year's lackluster levels," he said in a statement. Some of the reasons for cutbacks were also company specific. At AT&T, for instance, spending fell 19.2 percent to $512 million, but much of the drop reflects an inflated budget a year ago when it underwent a big rebranding campaign. GM's drop, meanwhile, marked the fourth straight quarter when its spending has fallen by at least 25 percent, as the troubled carmaker has slashed its marketing budget even as it has closed factories and cut jobs. Its marketing spending in the first quarter of 2007 fell to $480.9 million, down almost 31 percent. Spending on network television commercials was hard hit by budget cuts and the absence of the Olympics, dropping 7.2 percent to $6.05 billion.
