 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Avaya Inc. ( AV.N ) on Monday said it agreed to be acquired by private equity firms TPG Capital and Silver Lake for $8.2 billion, the latest in a string of mergers in the telecommunications-equipment industry. 

 Under the terms of the agreement, Avaya shareholders will receive $17.50 in cash for each company share, a premium of about 28 percent to its closing share price on May 25, 2007, when reports about a possible deal began to circulate. Avaya's small size compared with rivals like Cisco Systems Inc. ( CSCO.O ) has long made the company a subject of takeover speculation. Such talk intensified last week after Avaya postponed an investor conference.
