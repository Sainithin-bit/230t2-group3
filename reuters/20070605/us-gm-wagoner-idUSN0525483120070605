 WILMINGTON, Delaware  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp.'s ( GM.N ) priorities for this year include concluding a deal to allow its former parts subsidiary Delphi Corp DPHIQ.PK to emerge from bankruptcy and cutting its own health care costs, the automaker's chief executive said on Tuesday. 

 "We'll continue to drive for cost-effective agreements to resolve the Delphi restructuring and to further reduce our still unsustainable health care bill, which was a staggering $4.8 billion in 2006," GM Chief Executive Rick Wagoner told shareholders in a statement at the start of the company's annual meeting. Separately, Wagoner said GM had awarded two advanced battery development contracts for work on its electric-driven Chevrolet Volt vehicle. Those contracts for development on the next-generation lithium-ion batteries of the Volt concept were awarded to a division of Germany's Continental AG ( CONG.DE ) and to Compact Power Inc., a unit of South Korea-based LG Chem Ltd. ( 051910.KS ), Wagoner said.
