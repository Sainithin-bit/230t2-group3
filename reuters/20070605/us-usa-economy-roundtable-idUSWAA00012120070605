 BOSTON  (Reuters) - U.S. chief executives' outlook on the economy dimmed in the second quarter, although they still expect growth, according to a quarterly survey by the Business Roundtable released on Tuesday. 

 The group said its CEO Economic Outlook Index dropped to 81.9 in May from 84.9 in March, matching its December reading. Any number above 50 indicates growth. Their forecast of U.S. gross domestic product growth this year also declined. The group said its CEO members, who manage 160 companies with $4.5 trillion in combined revenues, now expect 2.6 percent GDP growth, compared with a forecast of 2.9 percent in March. High energy prices and the slowing U.S. housing market are the main economic worries CEOs are currently facing, said Harold McGraw 3d, the group's chairman, on a conference call with reporters. "The index suggests some minor flattening of some of the economic momentum," said McGraw, who is also chairman and chief executive of The McGraw-Hill Cos. Inc. MHP.N "Obviously, some sectors of the economy are facing challenging conditions, for example housing, construction -- and really there we're talking about residential construction -- and sectors directly effected by higher energy costs." HOUSING A WORRY The findings came on the same day that Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke warned investors that the slowing U.S. housing market may weigh on the economy for some time. "The adjustment in the housing sector is still ongoing, and the slowdown in residential construction now appears likely to remain a drag on economic growth for somewhat longer than previously expected," Bernanke told a monetary policy conference in Cape town, South Africa, by satellite. <ID:nN05484991> After several years of strong growth, supported by aggressive lending practices at some banks, the U.S. housing market is slowing. Data released on Monday showed that in the first quarter American home prices rose 2.8 percent, their lowest year-over-year increase since 1993. Investors fear that, with a flattening in house prices, U.S. consumers won't be able to spend as freely as they did in recent years, when many took advantage of second mortgages that were available to them because of rising prices. "While the survey does suggest that the economy is settling into a softer consolidation phase, as long as consumers keep spending, the economy can continue to move ahead," McGraw said. STAYING FLEXIBLE The majority of CEOs polled -- 66 percent -- expected their companies' sales to rise over the next six months. That's down from the 73 percent of CEOs who predicted higher sales in March. The findings showed that the CEO's were more likely to invest in staff than equipment over the next six months, signaling that they want to remain flexible to react to any possible slowdown. Some 34 percent said they expected to raise their U.S. capital spending over the next six months, down from the 44 percent who predicted that in March. But 42 percent said they were likely to raise their U.S. staffing, up from 33 percent. "What you're seeing is that there is a cautiousness that if sales might have a little bit of doubt in them, then we ought to be a little bit more cautious on the equipment spending," McGraw said. The poll of CEOs of the group's member companies was conducted from May 11 through May 23.
