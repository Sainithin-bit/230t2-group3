 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - All 12 regional Federal Reserve banks asked the central bank's board to hold the cost of emergency Fed loans steady in April and May, with most bank directors expecting the U.S. economy to resume a moderate expansion over the rest of the year. 

 The minutes of meetings of the Washington-based Fed Board of Governors, which must approve changes in the discount rate governing Fed lending to commercial banks, showed that Fed regional bank directors agreed with the current stance of steady monetary policy with a close eye on incoming economic data. The board approved their requests to keep the discount rate steady at 6.25 percent on April 23 and on May 7. The Fed's policy setting Federal Open Market Committee maintained the more important federal funds rate on May 9 at 5.25 percent. "Although directors noted rather weak GDP growth in the first quarter, most expected the overall economy to resume moderate expansion over the balance of the year as the contraction of the housing activity abated," minutes of the May 7 meeting said. "Several directors considered tight conditions in the labor market to represent an upside risk to expectations that core inflation would drift down over the remainder of the year. Others viewed risks to growth and inflation to be about evenly balanced," the Fed minutes said. The directors generally agreed that the best course was to maintain the current stance of monetary policy for now while keeping a close watch on incoming data to determine areas with the greatest potential risks, according to the minutes. The Fed has left its key federal funds rate at 5.25 percent since June 2006 after raising it from an ultra-low 1 percent over two years. Directors of the 12 regional Fed banks are independent business people, but their interest rate preferences can shed light on the internal thinking of their respective branches and bank presidents, several of whom sit on the FOMC.
