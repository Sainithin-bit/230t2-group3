 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Asian energy stocks such as Japan's INPEX rose on Tuesday following a jump in oil prices to above $70 a barrel, but concerns about weakness in mainland Chinese shares kept regional markets subdued. 

 The Shanghai market  .SSEC  tumbled 8.3 percent on Monday in its second biggest one-day percentage drop this decade following last week's hike in a share-trading tax to cool a market that had nearly tripled in value over the past year. At 0023 GMT, Tokyo's Nikkei average  .N225  had edged up 0.1 percent, led by gains of about 1 percent for both electronics components maker TDK ( 6762.T ) and industrial robot maker Fanuc ( 6954.T ). "Today's market may move little as investors are likely to take profits once the Nikkei climbs to the 18,000 level on some technical concerns that it has risen too high," said Hiroichi Nishi, general manager of equity marketing at Nikko Cordial Securities. Oil explorer INPEX Holdings ( 1605.T ) climbed 0.9 percent, outpacing the broader market after London Brent crude LCOc1 jumped $1.33 to $70.40 on Monday. News that a cyclone was headed towards the oil-producing Arabian peninsula raised worries about potential disruption to shipping and output. In Australia, oil and gas producer Woodside Petroleum ( WPL.AX ) added 0.4 percent while Santos ( STO.AX ) hit a record high before reversing direction as the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index .AXJO eased 0.2 percent, taking a breather a day after reaching a record high. Recent gainers such as mining giant BHP Billiton ( BHP.AX ) eased and Metcash ( MTS.AX ) slid 7 percent after the top grocery wholesaler said it expected earnings growth in the high-single digit range for the current year. South Korea's key KOSPI  .KS11  was little changed after setting a fresh record high as modest gains in Samsung Electronics ( 005930.KS ) were offset by declines in steel maker POSCO ( 005490.KS ) and top lender Kookmin Bank 060000.KS. "The falls in Chinese markets are not causing a worldwide sell-off, but still, (domestic) markets have gained quite a bit and there's going to be some resistance," warned Kim Hak-kyun, an analyst at Korea Investment Securities. MSCI's measure of Asia Pacific stocks excluding Japan .MSCIAPJ edged 0.1 percent higher, adding to Monday's 0.9 percent rise. On Wall Street, both the blue-chip Dow and wider S&P 500 index  .SPX  eked out closing records on Monday thanks to gains in energy shares.
