 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission confirmed on Tuesday that it would file suit to block Whole Foods Market Inc.'s WFMI.O proposed acquisition of rival Wild Oats Markets Inc. OATS.O 

 The FTC's five commissioners voted unanimously to challenge the deal, saying the combination of the two chains would eliminate competition between two "uniquely close competitors."
