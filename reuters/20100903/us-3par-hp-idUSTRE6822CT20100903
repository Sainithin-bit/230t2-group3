 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Data storage provider 3PAR Inc ( PAR.N ) said on Friday that shareholders owning about a third of its shares have agreed to accept Hewlett-Packard Co's( HPQ.N ) proposal to buy the company for $2.4 billion. 

 HP won a bidding war for 3PAR as Dell Inc DELL.O bowed out on Thursday when HP raised its cash offer by $3 to $33 per share to trump Dell's $32-a-share offer. 3PAR had traded mostly around $10 this year, until Dell announced a $18 per share bid in mid-August. Its shares were down 3 cents at $32.85 in premarket trade after closing at $33.88 on New York Stock Exchange Thursday. The storage company competes with bigger rival EMC Corp ( EMC.N ) in a key part of "cloud computing" -- an increasingly popular technology that lets computer users access data and software over the Internet, allowing companies to cut costs.
