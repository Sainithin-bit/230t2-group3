 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - GAP Inc said on Sunday it launched an investigation after it was told earlier this week about an allegation of child labor at a factory in India that was working on one product for GapKids. 

 The company said a very small portion of a particular order placed with one of its vendors was given to an unauthorized subcontractor without its knowledge, which violated its agreement with the vendor. The company said it stopped the work order as soon as it was alerted and prevented product from being sold in stores. It said it strictly prohibits the use of child labor.
