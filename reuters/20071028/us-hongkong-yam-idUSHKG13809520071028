 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Joseph Yam will step down as chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the territory's de-facto central bank, in 2009, government sources said on Sunday. 

 Yam has headed the HKMA since 1993 and was involved in the introduction of Hong Kong's currency peg to the U.S. dollar in 1983. He has been a staunch defender of the peg and has been a key player in negotiating with China to introduce Chinese currency business in Hong Kong in recent years. A government spokesman said Yam will be 60 next year, the Civil Service retirement age. However, Yam had been expected to continue in the post beyond retirement age. The spokesman said it was too early to say who would replace Yam, but Norman Chan, a close ally of Chief Executive Donald Tsang, is seen a likely choice. Chan worked with Yam at the HKMA until 2005 and now runs Donald Tsang's office. The HKMA declined comment.
