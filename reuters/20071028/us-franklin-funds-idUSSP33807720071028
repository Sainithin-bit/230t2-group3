 SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - Fund manager Franklin Templeton launched 38 new funds in Singapore on Sunday, more than doubling its fund offerings in the city-state as it seeks to tap growing wealth management opportunities in Asia. 

 The new funds include its Asian Flex Cap Fund, a Mutual European Fund that seeks opportunities in merger arbitrage and distressed debt situations in Europe, and a Natural Resources Fund. The new offerings take the total number of funds in Singapore at Franklin Templeton, part of the largest publicly traded U.S. asset manager Franklin Resources Inc ( BEN.N ), to 58. Stephen Grundlingh, the Singapore country head for Frank Templeton Investments, said the wealth management industry in Asia is estimated to grow by $350 billion over the next ten years. The firm said Singapore's retail fund market has grown at a rate of 23 percent year-on-year from 2001 to 2006. California-based Franklin Templeton Investments manages over $645 billion on behalf of institutional and retail investors.
