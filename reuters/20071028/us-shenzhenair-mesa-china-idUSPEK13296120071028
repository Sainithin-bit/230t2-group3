 BEIJING  (Reuters) - Kunpeng Airlines, a venture between China's Shenzhen Airlines Ltd and U.S.-based Mesa Air Group Inc MESA.O has begun operating in China's northwest Shaanxi Province, Xinhua said late on Saturday. 

 The new airline is the first such venture by a U.S. carrier in the growing Chinese market, and hopes to expand rapidly before next year's Beijing Olympic Games. The airline gives Mesa a foothold in one of the world's fastest growing economies at a time when expansion for regional carriers in the United States is slowing. Kunpeng Airlines, in which the Chinese partner has a controlling stake, has three 50-seat Bombardier ( BBDb.TO ) CRJ-200 jets, said Xinhua. The airline plans to expand its fleet to six aircraft by the year-end and to 20 before next August's Olympics. Mesa flies regional routes for several U.S. carriers, including US Airways Group Inc ( LCC.N ) and Delta Air Lines Inc DALRQ.PK. It also runs an inter-island service in Hawaii. Shenzhen Airlines, with a fleet of 45 aircraft, flies 100 routes in China and Southeast Asia. (US$=7.50 yuan)
