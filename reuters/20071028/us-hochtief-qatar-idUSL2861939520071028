 DUBAI  (Reuters) - German construction firm Hochtief ( HOTG.DE ) has won a contract for commercial and residential development from Qatar's Barwa Real Estate Co BRES.QA, the Middle East Economic Digest reported. 

 Hochtief will build shops and office and residential buildings along an 8.6 km (5.3 mile) avenue in the Barwa City development in the Qatari capital, Doha, the London-based weekly said, without giving the value of the deal. Another German firm, Bilfinger Berger ( GBFG.DE ), said in May it had won a 1 billion euro ($1.44 billion) contract to build part of a residential complex in Barwa City. Hochtief was also selected as part of a consortium to build the estimated $2 billion, 45 km- (27.96 mile-) long causeway linking Qatar to the island kingdom of Bahrain, the MEED said. Government-owned Qatari Diar Real Estate & Investment Co, which bought London's Chelsea Barracks in April, owns 45 percent of Barwa.
