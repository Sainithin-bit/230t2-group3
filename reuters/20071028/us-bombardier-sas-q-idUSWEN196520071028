 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bombardier Inc. ( BBDb.TO ) said on Sunday it was disappointed with a decision by Scandinavian airline SAS ( SAS.ST ) to permanently discontinue flight operations with Bombardier Q400 aircraft. 

 SAS said it would stop using Dash 8 Q400 aircraft after a series of crash landings, the latest on Saturday in Copenhagen. Bombardier said the landing incident was still under investigation by Danish authorities. The company also said that it did not identify a systemic landing gear issue in an assessment that it did.
