 ZURICH  (Reuters) - Swiss pharmaceuticals group Novartis ( NOVN.VX ) has concluded a $500 million, 7-year global infrastructure contract with British telecoms group BT ( BT.L ), a Novartis spokesman said on Sunday. 

 The spokesman said less than 200 jobs at Novartis would be affected by the deal and that many positions would be transferred to external vendors. The deal was one of a number of productivity initiatives that Novartis is currently examining. "Part of the savings can be invested back in the business," said the spokesman.
