 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Apple Inc's quarterly profit and revenue blew past Wall Street expectations on strong sales of iPhones and iPods, sending its shares up 2 percent in after-hours trading. 

 The company gave an outlook for the current quarter that was typically conservative. COMMENTARY: SHAW WU, ANALYST, KAUFMAN BROTHERS "It was a very strong quarter. Apple came in above on both the top and bottom lines. Gross margin really drove the EPS upside. It came at 36.4 percent versus its 32.5 percent guidance." "In terms of the business units, Macs were a little light of the higher end of expectations, iPods and iPhones both above expectations." "Guidance was conservative as it usually is. They guided below consensus, which is something investors are accustomed to." ANDY HARGREAVES, ANALYST, PACIFIC CREST SECURITIES: "It's a great number. Gross margins stood out. The strength in the iPod and iPhones continued. There is going to be concern in this quarter due to purchasing delays in front of new June product releases, but outside of that, it's really clean." ERIC KUBY, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, NORTHSTAR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT CORP, CHICAGO "Apple has been one of a few companies where business has been pretty strong throughout this economic downturn. I think if a company that was maybe more cyclical came out with an earnings beat that might help the overall tone better." "People know Apple's business is generally pretty strong. So I think it's good for Apple, but not necessarily good for the whole market. It's good news. Any positive earnings surprise is good news. It's good to see that the iPod and the iPhone are humming along." BARRY JARUZELSKI, PARTNER, BOOZ & COMPANY "What's the upside of going out on a limb (with a stronger outlook) with where the overall economy is going? Being circumspect is not exactly out of order given the times we live in. "They continue to do relatively well even though Mac volumes are down only a little. With only a 3 percent decline they have gained market share...because the overall PC market is down more than that. Their competitive stance has improved." "You could have argued whether it be in smartphone or computer they are at the higher end of price point...their customers for the average consumer. They are a fairly large purchase. The fact that they held up this well shows the strength of the brand, the overall value of the design, and the value placed on ease of use." "The results themselves are pretty respectable on an absolute basis." On CEO Steve Jobs: "Apple is a $30 billion company. It's an institution and clearly Jobs has been an iconic leader but ....there is a deep bench of talented people there at all levels. It's fun to try to make it all one person but it's an institution that has been highly successful over the years." SHANNON CROSS, ANALYST, CROSS RESEARCH "Momentum remains strong. The company always guides conservatively. IPod's were very strong. Macs were relatively in line." "This quarter shows Apple's resiliency in the face of very weak economic conditions. In addition, it shows the popularity of the iPhone worldwide." "IPhone was well above the Street's 3.3 million estimate. Gross margin was very strong at 36.4 percent in the quarter. The company likely benefited from low component costs and strong ASPs (average selling prices) for their products."
