 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Boeing Co ( BA.N ) said on Wednesday it saw some risks, but also opportunities, in Defense Secretary Robert Gates' proposed overhaul of the fiscal 2010 defense budget, which analysts say hit the No. 2 Pentagon supplier harder than most of its competitors. 

 "We're in the process now of understanding precisely what the impacts to us and the customer are, and also understanding what the opportunities are for us," Jim Albaugh, head of Boeing's Integrated Defense Systems (IDS), told Reuters. He said Boeing was well-positioned in the cybersecurity, special operations, rotorcraft and unmanned vehicle markets, several key areas that he said should expand as Gates realigned defense spending to better address unconventional threats. International sales should also help offset any decline in U.S. defense spending, Albaugh told Reuters in an interview. "We've been repositioning the company into areas that we think will grow faster than the Department of Defense budget as a whole," he said. "There's also more opportunity than I've ever seen in my career." He said Boeing had made six key acquisitions in the cybersecurity, unmanned vehicles, and logistics areas last year, and was always looking for more targeted takeovers. Boeing Chief Executive James McNerney acknowledged in a call with analysts that some Boeing programs were clearly affected by Gates' proposed changes, but said it was too soon to predict the impact on Boeing's defense business, given that any budget changes needed to be approved by Congress. Gates called for cancellation of $87 billion in ground vehicles being developed for the Army's Future Combat Systems modernization program, a $1.4 billion cut in funding for missile defense, both programs led by Boeing, as well as a halt in production of the Lockheed Martin Corp ( LMT.N ) F-22 fighter jet, one-third of which is built by Boeing. Gates also called for an end to production of Boeing's C-17 transport plane, canceled a competition for new search and rescue helicopters in which Boeing was competing, and scrapped the advanced Transformational Communications satellite competition, in which Boeing was competing against Lockheed. McNerney predicted a "healthy and rigorous" discussion between Congress and the Pentagon over some of those programs over the next seven to eight months. "While it will be some time before we know the final impact of these discussions, we continue to believe IDS is well-positioned in a large, addressable market," McNerney said. Boeing officials told analysts the company was also looking to international sales to help offset any declines in U.S. defense spending and said it had a "pretty rich backlog." International deals on hand included four C-17 transport planes on order by the United Arab Emirates, F-15 and F-18 fighter jets, helicopters, and a maritime surveillance plane being built for India, company officials said. Albaugh said the C-17 transport plane, kept alive in recent years by funding added to the defense budget by Congress, still enjoyed strong support from lawmakers, but it was too soon to say what would happen in pending budget negotiations. He said Boeing had anticipated Gates' move on the Combat Search and Rescue helicopter competition, but hoped to bid a variant of its CH-47 Chinook helicopter and the V-22 tilt-rotor aircraft in any future competition. In the satellite area, he said, Boeing expected to receive orders for three more Wideband Global System satellites, in addition to the six already ordered. He said Boeing could benefit from a 5 percent proposed increase in funding for U.S. Special Operations Command, which could translate into additional rotorcraft orders, and the acceleration of certain elements of the Army's FCS program. Boeing shares were up $1.16 or 3.2 percent at $37.81 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday afternoon. (Reporting by Andrea Shalal-Esa; Editing by  Tim Dobbyn  and  Matthew Lewis )
