 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Continental Airlines CAL.N posted its fifth straight quarterly loss on Wednesday on weaker travel demand, particularly among business travelers, echoing a trend seen among most major airlines this earnings season. 

 The Houston-based company posted a net loss of $136 million, or $1.10 cents per share. A year earlier, the Houston-based company reported a smaller net loss of $80 million, or 81 cents per share. Excluding $4 million of aircraft-related charges, the carrier saw a net loss of $132 million or $1.07 per share. Like other airlines, Continental has cut capacity and fares in an bid to fight wilting demand. Still, the company's mainline load factor-- a measure of how full the plane is-- was 75.8, off 3 points from a year ago. Revenue fell 17 percent to $3 billion.
