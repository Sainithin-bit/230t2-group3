 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc ( QCOM.O ) said it was in advanced settlement talks with Broadcom Corp ( BRCM.O ) over their legal disputes and that its quarterly results would meet or beat estimates, sending both companies shares up. 

 Qualcomm also rescheduled its quarterly earnings announcement to April 27 at the last minute on Wednesday saying that if the companies did reach a global settlement it would impact results for its second fiscal quarter ended in March. Broadcom did not return requests for comment. The companies have been involved in legal battles, spanning several years and three continents, related to allegations of technology patent infringement and anti-competitive behavior. While Broadcom has won many of the recent court battles, analysts have long expected both sides to reach an agreement. Shares of Qualcomm rose 4 percent after the news and Broadcom shares rose 7 percent. "The market likes the removal of uncertainty even in the absence of knowing what the settlement might be," said JMP analyst Alex Gauna who expects the pair to sign an agreement to license each others technologies. Qualcomm, which would not comment further on the talks, said that there was no assurance it would be able to reach a final agreement with Broadcom over their disputes. After Broadcom's earnings report on Tuesday, its Chief Executive Scott McGregor had told Reuters that he was still interested in reaching an agreement with Qualcomm but that there was no news suggesting they were any closer to a deal. "I've said all along that our hope is to eventually find a way to settle with Qualcomm. Some day I hope that happens, but I certainly don't have any news that would suggest we're closer," McGregor said. Broadcom had said on Tuesday that it was filing a lawsuit against Emulex ( ELX.N ), a company for which it made an unsolicited acquisition bid. Legal battles between Qualcomm and Broadcom include cases brought before US trade regulators, European regulators and Korean regulators as well as the California courts. Last year Qualcomm settled a long-standing dispute with the world's biggest mobile phone maker, Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ), after they reached an agreement about patent royalties. Gauna said that while Qualcomm has suffered along with its rivals from weak chip demand because of the recession, the company had been widely expected to meet quarterly targets. On average, analysts had been expecting Qualcomm to report a second-quarter earnings per share of 41 cents on revenue of $2.35 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Gauna said investors would be most anxious to hear details of the settlement and outlook for 2009 when it does report. Qualcomm shares were up 4 percent at $41.88 in late trade after closing at $40.12 on Nasdaq. Broadcom shares were up 4 percent to $24.05 in late trade after closing up 10 percent at $22.61 also on Nasdaq. (Reporting by  Sinead Carew ; Editing by  Richard Chang ,  Leslie Gevirtz )
