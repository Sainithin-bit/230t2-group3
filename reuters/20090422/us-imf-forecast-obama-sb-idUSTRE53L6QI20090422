 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - An International Monetary Fund report projecting an even deeper global recession was a "sobering" reminder of economic challenges facing the world, the White House said on Wednesday. 

 "It is another sobering statistic in the problem that we face globally," White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters traveling with President Barack Obama back to Washington from Iowa. (Reporting by  Ross Colvin  and  Caren Bohan ; editing by  Todd Eastham )
