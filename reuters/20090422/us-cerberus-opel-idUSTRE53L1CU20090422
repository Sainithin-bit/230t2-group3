 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - U.S. financial investor Cerberus CBS.UL has no interest in taking a stake in General Motors' ( GM.N ) Opel business, a source close to the situation told Reuters on Wednesday. 

 Speculation of this was unfounded, the source said, also denying German newspaper reports that officials from Cerberus -- majority owner of U.S. carmaker Chrysler -- had started talks with the German government about this. Cerberus declined comment. (Reporting by  Philipp Halstrick ; Writing by  Michael Shields )
