 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said on Wednesday he had no idea whether the apparent suicide of a senior official at Freddie Mac was related to investigations of the troubled mortgage giant. 

 "It's obviously tragic but I don't know anything more than what I've read," Holder told reporters at an Earth Day event when asked about the death of Freddie Mac's acting chief financial officer, David Kellermann. Holder answered "no idea" when asked if Kellermann's death might be related to any probe of Freddie Mac. (Reporting by  Randall Mikkelsen ; Editing by  Doina Chiacu )
