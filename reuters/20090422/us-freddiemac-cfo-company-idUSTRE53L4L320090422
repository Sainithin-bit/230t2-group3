 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The death of a top financial executive at mortgage finance giant Freddie Mac was not linked to federal investigations into the company's business, a spokesman said on Tuesday. 

 "Freddie Mac knows of no connections between this terrible personal tragedy and the ongoing regulatory inquiries discussed in our SEC filings," said David Palombi, the executive communications officer for the mortgage finance company. In March, Freddie Mac said that it was cooperating with the Securities and Exchange Commission in an investigation and that employees have been interviewed by investigators.
