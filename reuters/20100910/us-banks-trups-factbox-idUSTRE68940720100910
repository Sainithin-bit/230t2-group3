 (Reuters) -The proposed Basel III capital rules for banks are unlikely to force U.S. lenders to raise billions in additional capital, unlike like their European counterparts. 

 But the new rules -- along with the financial industry reforms recently passed by the U.S. Congress -- will force many U.S. regional banks to replace portions of their capital funded by hybrid securities, like trust preferred securities, with common equity. First introduced in 1993, trust preferred securities have become a key core capital source for many U.S. banks, particularly regional lenders. But under the new Basel and U.S. rules, they will be largely excluded when measuring a bank's capital position. Trust preferred securities, issued by a bank holding company's trust subsidiary, contain characteristics of both debt and equity. The securities typically have long payment periods (up to 30 years) and pay out interest on a quarterly or semi-annual basis. Under the proposed Basel rules, hybrid securities cannot make up more than 15 percent of a bank's core capital. The new U.S. rules require most U.S. banks to wind down such holdings completely in the coming years. Many banks with major trust preferred securities holdings will be required to raise new capital to comply with the new rules. The following are major U.S. regional banks with trust preferred securities holdings above 15 percent of their common equity: Bank Trust preferred/Common equity ratio Total trust preferred Fifth Third Bancorp 27.4% $2.7 billion KeyCorp 22.2% $1.8 billion BB&T Corp 19.6% $3.3 billion Wells Fargo & Co 17.2% $19.2 billion M&T Bank Corp 16% $1.2 billion Huntington Bancshares Inc 15.9% $593 million US Bancorp 15.2% $4 billion (Reporting by Joe Rauch)
