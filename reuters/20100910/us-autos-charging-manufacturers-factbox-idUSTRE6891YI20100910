 LONDON  (Reuters) - Several countries are embracing electric vehicles by offering incentives to drivers, and rewards for the companies developing them. 

 Electric vehicles are seen as a part of the fight against climate change because they emit less carbon dioxide than petrol or diesel-powered cars. But takeup is likely to be slow because of the lack of recharging infrastructure to guarantee adequate driving ranges. Listed below are some of the main infrastructure providers: * AEROVIRONMENT California-based company supplying charging systems for electric forklift trucks, and for electric vehicle charging at shopping malls and business parks, home garages and car parks. * BETTER PLACE Building an ambitious global network of charge spots and "switch-stations," petrol station-like outlets where drivers can swap their almost-drained batteries for fully charged ones. Raised $350 million in fresh equity in January. * CARBATT SYSTEMS Norwegian company with its own exchangeable battery system. The exchange takes about a minute, with stations located at petrol stations and other points around Norway. * CAR CHARGING INC Installs electric car charging stations -- manufactured by Coulomb Technologies -- in North America. * CIRCONTROL Spanish manufacturer of recharging stations. Aims to supply 10,000 recharging points before the end of 2011. Supplies its 'CirCarLife' recharging points to more than 15 countries worldwide. * COULOMB TECHNOLOGIES Says it will provide 5,000 free home and public 'ChargePoint' network charging stations for electric vehicles in nine regions of the United States. The program will cost $37 million and aims to install more than 1,000 by December 2010. * ECOTALITY ECOtality North America claims its "Minit Charger" line can charge an electric vehicle in 15 minutes. Partnered with Nissan North America. The two companies were given a $114.8 million grant from the U.S. department of energy to deploy up to 8,300 EVs along with 15,085 charging systems in six U.S. states by the end of 2012. * EDF Electricite de France and Toyota launched a 3-year plug-in hybrid electric vehicle demonstration in April. The trial, in the city of Strasbourg, involves 100 plug-in hybrids with a charging infrastructure. EDF wants to get feedback from users on different options for the infrastructure for future commercialization. * ELECTRIC TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING CORP (eTec) Based in Arizona, eTec was awarded almost $100 million by the U.S. government to deploy 12,500 220 volt charging systems and 250 fast-charge systems to support Nissan LEAF electric cars. * ELEKTROMOTIVE Founded in 2003, this UK company designs and installs recharging systems for on-street or multi-story car parks in Europe and the United States. In 2008, its 'Elektrobay' recharging infrastructure was rolled out in 21 locations across London. * ENDESA/TELEFONICA Endesa and Telefonica unveiled first EV telephone booth recharging station in Valencia, Spain, in May. The pilot scheme will run until the end of this year, using a prepaid card or coins of one euro per recharge. * EPYON Netherlands-based company unveiled a 400-volt charging system in May which allows several vehicles to be charged at once. Claims it can recharge the Nissan LEAF up to 80 percent in 30 minutes. * EV-CHARGE AMERICA Provides charging stations with smart grid software that helps utilities and municipalities manage their grid loads as the number of electric vehicles increases. Has also developed stations capable of charging four vehicles at the same time. * EV CHARGING NETWORK Provides UK listings of charge points available for electric vehicles. * NISSAN/GENERAL ELECTRIC Announced a 3-year partnership to develop EV charging infrastructure in April. * PARK & CHARGE Installed 120 recharging stations in Switzerland. Lists 500 more potential locations in Switzerland, Germany and Austria. * 350GREEN Early-stage EV startup looking for $35 million in funding for charging station network. * ZECO SYSTEMS Singaporean clean technology company has launched 10 charging stations in Singapore.
