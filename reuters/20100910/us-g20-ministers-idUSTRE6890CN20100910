 SEOUL  (Reuters) - Finance ministers from the Group of 20 developed and leading emerging economies are not likely to meet on the sidelines of the IMF/World Bank Group annual gatherings in Washington early next month, sources said. 

 Instead, deputy ministers would hold a meeting on the sidelines of the annual gathering from October 8-10, sources with knowledge of the matter said. But the sources said finance ministers from the five steering group members, Britain, Canada, France, South Korea and the United States, would probably meet. Finance ministers and central bank chiefs from the 20 economies are due to meet in the South Korean city of Gyeongju in late October to fine tune the agenda for the November 11-12 leaders' summit in Seoul. Officials at the South Korean committee preparing for the summit could not confirm details, but its website ( www.seoulsummit.kr ) showed a deputies' meeting was scheduled in Washington. When the IMF and the World Bank held spring meetings in Washington in April, finance and central bank chiefs from G20 economies also held a meeting.
