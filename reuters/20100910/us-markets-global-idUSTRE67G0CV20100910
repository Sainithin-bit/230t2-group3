 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rose on Friday after strong import data from China bolstered rising optimism about global growth, while stocks edged higher, buoyed by the economic outlook and a 3 percent gain in oil prices. 

 Chinese imports jumped in August, helping lift equity markets and commodity prices while diminishing the safe-haven appeal of the Japanese yen and Swiss franc. China's imports rose 35.2 percent in August from a year earlier, which easily beat market forecasts and suggested potential stronger domestic demand in an economy that is a major driver of global growth. The dollar was up 0.43 percent at 84.16 yen. But it remained near 15-year lows, keeping the prospect for yen intervention alive. "Risk aversion has subsided a little bit as a result of the positive import data out of China overnight," said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington. "That has revived a little bit of hope that China can in fact contribute more sustainably to a global recovery." Global stocks reversed early losses to trade higher as the Dow and S&P 500 posted their seventh gain in eight sessions. The benchmark S&P 500 is now up 5.7 percent in September, while MSCI's all-country world equity index .MIWD00000PUS, which added 0.2 percent on Friday, has gained 5.2 percent for the month. Energy shares advanced as crude futures rose above $76 per barrel after an outage forced the biggest pipeline to supply Canadian oil to refineries in the U.S. Midwest and to a key storage hub in Oklahoma to shut down. The PHLX oil services sector index .OSX gained 2.4 percent. "There's been a resurgence in optimism about the economy, and that's directly linked to oil demand," said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois. Worries in August that the U.S. economy was poised to slip back into recession have waned as economic data, while still sluggish, has beat consensus forecasts since September began. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  closed up 47.53 points, or 0.46 percent, at 10,462.77. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  added 5.37 points, or 0.49 percent, at 1,109.55. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  rose 6.28 points, or 0.28 percent, at 2,242.48. Trading was light. The combined volume of stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange and Nasdaq was 5.68 billion shares, almost half last year's daily average of 9.65 billion. The week was shortened by the U.S. Labor Day holiday on Monday and trading desks were reduced because of Jewish new year celebrations on Thursday and Friday. While the U.S. crude contract for delivery in October rose as much as $76.59 a barrel, the highest since mid-August, a leading forecaster said demand would remain tepid. The International Energy Agency said global oil demand growth was expected to increase a little this year but slip in 2011 and that fuel consumption could be much weaker if the world economy slows. The front-month U.S. contract settled up $2.20 at $76.45. In London, Brent crude oil was up just 69 cents a barrel at $78.11 as concerns about global demand still weighed. The U.S. Dollar Index .DXY was up 0.24 percent at 82.873, while the euro was up 0.11 percent at $1.2708. U.S. Treasuries fell for the third consecutive day and logged their worst week since March as loads of government and corporate supply weighed on a market that many still see as over-priced. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was down 10/32 in price to yield 2.79 percent. Gold steadied at moderately lower levels below $1,250 an ounce as the yen slid against the dollar and investors continued to unwind safe-haven plays taken out earlier this week. U.S. December gold futures eased $4.40 to end at $1,246.50 an ounce in New York. Copper slipped, suffering its first weekly decline in four weeks, as investors weighed mixed indicators of demand in China -- potential monetary tightening versus strong import data. News that Beijing had moved the release of key economic data for August to Saturday from Monday sparked concerns about a possible surge in China's consumer price index. Copper for December delivery in New York fell 3.70 cents to end at $3.4065 a pound. Earlier in Asia, stocks rose to a four-month high. The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan edged up 0.2 percent .MIAPJ0000PUS, while Tokyo's Nikkei share average closed 1.6 percent  .N225  higher.
