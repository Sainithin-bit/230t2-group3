 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Wholesale inventories surged the most in two years in July, adding to signs that economic growth in the third quarter of the year may prove a bit stronger than many forecasters had expected. 

 Inventories jumped 1.3 percent, the steepest gain since July 2008, the Commerce Department said on Friday. Analysts had expected a rise of just 0.4 percent. The broad-based gains in July led some analysts to bump up their forecasts for third-quarter Gross Domestic Product slightly. Financial markets, however, paid little attention to the report. A restocking of inventories has helped drive the economy's recovery. But some analysts have said slowing demand has likely left businesses with ample stocks and they expect the boost from inventories to fade in the second half of the year. "While it is early in the quarter and only one sector of the economy, today's report suggests that inventory accumulation will continue to support GDP growth in Q3," Peter Newland of Barclays Capital in New York said in a note to clients. A quickened pace of inventory accumulation had accounted for 0.6 percentage point of the economy's 1.6 percent annual growth rate during the second quarter. A Reuters poll on Wednesday showed analysts had scaled back their forecasts for third-quarter growth to an annualized 1.8 percent from 2.4 percent in an August poll. While the economy still seems stuck in a slow-growth path, data in recent days has suggested a bit more economic vigor than forecasters had expected. Private sector job growth in August surprised to the upside, and reports on Thursday showed a narrower-than-expected trade gap in July and a bigger drop in claims for jobless benefits last week than forecast. Friday's report showed wholesale sales rose by a larger-than-expected 0.6 percent in July. However, the sales increase followed declines in June and May, suggesting a portion of July's inventory gains may have been unintended. Some analysts said sales would need to stay strong to support continued inventory building. "In general there has been an increase in inventories at a time when the economy is slowing down," said Brian Bethune, an economist with IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Massachusetts. "Something's gotta give here. Either the economy picks up or production has to be cut." The inventory-to-sales ratio, which measures how long it would take to clear shelves at the current sales pace, edged up to 1.16 months' worth. It was the highest since February, but was down from 1.27 months' worth a year ago. (Editing by Dan Grebler)
