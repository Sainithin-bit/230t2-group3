 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ), Germany's top lender, is planning a share issue of up to 9 billion euros ($11.42 billion), sources told Reuters late on Thursday, in a move to bolster its balance sheet and war chest. 

 Here are some of the views from analysts and brokerages: MATTHIAS DUERR, ANALYST AT DZ BANK, FRANKFURT: "The news will be burden (Deutsche Bank's) share price. We recommend being cautious ... until more details of a capital hike are released. The fair value of (Deutsche Bank) is under review." HEINO RULAND, STRATEGIST AT RULAND RESEARCH, FRANKFURT: "It is hawked that (Basel III) capital requirement can reach a maximum of 16.0 percent of tier 1. Tier 1 capital reached 34.4 billion euros at the end of last year. In case of fulfilling rumored requests (Deutsche Bank) would need an additional 9.3 billion euros. Deutsche Postbank ( DPBGn.DE ) is probably less of an issue as (Deutsche Bank) recently mentioned that it has all time in the world to raise its stake." CLOSE BROTHERS SEYDLER RESEARCH, FRANKFURT: "Deutsche Bank may use the proceeds received from selling new stock to increase its stake in Deutsche Postbank AG and to meet rising regulatory capital requirements. This reinforces worries about the health of European financial institutes." (Compiled by Christoph Steitz)
