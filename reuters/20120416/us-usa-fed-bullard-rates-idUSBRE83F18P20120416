 LOGAN, Utah  (Reuters) - St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said on Monday he still expects the Fed to raise interest rates later next year, adding the U.S. economic recovery is on track despite a "mediocre" March jobs report. 
 "We haven't done our (St. Louis Fed) forecast that's coming next week but I don't see a lot of change in our forecast," Bullard told reporters. "The data has come our way." (Reporting by Debbie Hummel in Logan; Writing by  Jonathan Spicer  in New York; Editing by Andrew Hay)
