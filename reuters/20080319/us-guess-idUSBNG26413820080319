 (Reuters) - Clothes and accessories retailer Guess Inc ( GES.N ) posted fourth-quarter profit above market estimates driven by strong sales in Europe and Asia, and backed its outlook for fiscal year 2009. 

 For the fourth quarter, the company posted net income of $55.2 million, or 59 cents a share, compared with $45.9 million, or 49 cents a share, a year earlier.

Analysts on average expected earnings of 57 cents a share, before items, on revenue of $467.4 million, according to Reuters Estimates.
