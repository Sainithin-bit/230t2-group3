 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Profits of Japanese automakers will take a hit in the next business year if the yen remains strong, but the government will not be asked to intervene in the currency markets to lessen the blow, the head of an auto industry group said on Wednesday. 

 Fujio Cho, chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association (JAMA), said industry profits would not be affected greatly in the current business year, which for most companies ends this month, as currency contracts have already been set. "But if the yen stays at current levels the impact will especially be felt from around the second half of the next business year," Cho, who is also chairman of Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ), told reporters. Cho's comments come after the dollar tumbled to a 13-year low of 95.77 yen on Monday on electronic trading platform EBS. The U.S. currency has since regained some ground and was fetching about 99.2 yen in afternoon trade on Wednesday.  Cho added, however, that the earnings of Japanese automakers are more resilient than they were a decade ago to yen strength against the dollar, partly because they now do more business in other currencies. He said there would not be calls for the government to step into the market to help weaken the yen. "We have no intention of calling on the government to intervene," he said. Japanese auto executives have generally forecast U.S. demand for light vehicles at 15.5 to 16 million vehicles this year, down slightly from 16.15 million in 2007 but buoyed by demand for fuel efficient models, which plays to the Japanese makers' strengths. "I won't drop the outlook for demand to come in a bit below 16 million but I am watching the situation carefully," he said. Toyota and others have already been taking measures, however, to cope with signs that demand is slowing in the U.S. Toyota said last week that it would trim U.S. production of its full-size Tundra pickup trucks, while Nissan Motor Co ( 7201.T ) said on Wednesday that it would halt operations at an assembly plant in Smyrna, Tennessee from March 28 to 31. "We will adjust inventory in step with a slowdown in the North American economy," said a Nissan spokeswoman. Japan's top auto firms also face a weak home market. JAMA said it expected demand for cars, trucks and buses to fall 0.6 percent to 5,306,100 vehicles in the next business year from April 2008, depressed in part by the high price of gasoline.
