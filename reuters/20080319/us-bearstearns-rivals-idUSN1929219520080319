 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bear Stearns Cos Inc BSC.N Chairman James Cayne and top shareholder Joe Lewis are quietly searching for a bidder that would top the offer from JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ), the New York Post reported on Wednesday. 

 Cayne and Lewis have contacted private equity firms, including J.C. Flowers and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co KKR.UL, as well as overseas banks Barclays ( BARC.L ), HSBC ( HSBA.L ), Credit Suisse ( CSGN.VX ), and Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ), the paper said, citing sources familiar with the matter. Cayne and Lewis combined hold nearly 15 percent of the stock of cash-strapped Bear Stearns. The all-stock offer from JP Morgan values Bear Stearns at about $280 million, compared to its valuation of $7.7 billion a week ago. Bear Stearns was not immediately available to comment. JPMorgan declined to comment. Bear Stearns shares, which have been trading above the offer of about $2.40 at current stock prices, were down 7.1 percent at $5.49 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
