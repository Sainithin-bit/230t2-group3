 TOKYO  (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan is likely to cut interest rates by the end of April due to growing downside risks for the economy, a sharp tightening in financial conditions and expectations of more Federal Reserve rate cuts, Goldman Sachs said in a report on Wednesday. 

 A political standoff over who will head the BOJ after Governor Toshihiko Fukui steps down on Wednesday is unlikely to prevent the central bank from cutting rates 25 basis points to 0.25 percent, said Goldman's chief Japan economist Tetsufumi Yamakawa.  "The turbulence surrounding the BOJ leadership changeover need not impede policy change," Yamakawa said in the report. Japanese interest rates at 0.5 percent are already near rock bottom, but Goldman said it looked as if the country had been in recession since the last quarter of last year, with U.S. weakness and abrupt rises in the yen added spurs for a rate cut. Most market players currently expect the BOJ to keep interest rates on hold for the rest of this year. Although the yen has surged as much as 30 percent against the dollar since the middle of last year, Yamakawa said authorities in Japan, a major exporter, were unlikely to intervene to hold back the currency's rise. A stronger yen makes Japanese goods less competitive in overseas markets and cuts into profits earned abroad when repatriated to Japan. But Yamakawa said the yen was still low by the measure of effective exchange rates, while intervention would draw criticism from China and elsewhere in Asia. Intervening in the market would be more costly following Japan's large-scale interventions in 2003 and early 2004, he added. (Reporting by  Hugh Lawson ; editing by Gary Crosse)
