 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Chrysler LLC expects to post a "big" decline in March U.S. sales compared with a year earlier, reflecting the automaker's decision to pull back from less profitable deals for car rental agencies, Chrysler sales chief Jim Press said on Wednesday. 

 Press was speaking to reporters at an event with other senior Chrysler executives on the sidelines of the New York auto show. Now controlled by Cerberus Capital Management CBS.UL, Chrysler has posted a 13 percent drop in U.S. sales in January and February. Separately, Tom LaSorda, who oversees the automaker's production activities, said he was "optimistic" Chrysler could meet its target for cutting U.S. factory workers through a program of buyouts and early retirement offers. Chrysler has said it aims to reduce by 8,000 to 10,000 its 44,000 U.S. blue-collar work force represented by the United Auto Workers union as part of its restructuring efforts.
