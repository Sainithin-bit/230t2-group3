 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Office furniture maker Herman Miller Inc ( MLHR.O ) on Wednesday posted higher quarterly earnings, citing cost cuts and a share buyback which reduced the number of shares outstanding. 

 Third-quarter net income rose to $38.3 million, or 65 cents a share, from $32.3 million, or 50 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected the Zeeland, Michigan-based company to post profits of 59 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. (Reporting by  Helen Chernikoff )
