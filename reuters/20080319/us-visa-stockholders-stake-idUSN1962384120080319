 (Reuters) - Following is a list of Visa Inc's ( V.N ) largest shareholders and the estimated value of their remaining equity interest in the company after each sold part of their stakes in Visa's IPO. 

 Visa staged its market debut on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday after an IPO that raised a record $17.9 billion. The San Francisco-based credit card network saw the value of its shares close up 28.4 percent to $56.50. Visa stockholders are subject to a lock-up period that restricts the immediate sale of their entire holdings, and the conversion of their Class B stock to Class A shares. The estimated value of each bank's remaining stakes at Wednesday's closing price is: * JP Morgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ) -- $2.5 billion. It garnered about $1.3 billion from the sale of shares in Visa's IPO. * Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) -- $1.2 billion. It garnered about $626 million from the sale of shares in Visa's IPO. * National City Corp NCC.N -- $868 million. It garnered about $436 million from the sale of shares in Visa's IPO. * Citigroup Inc ( C.N ) -- $598 million. It garnered about $300 million from the sale of shares in Visa's IPO. * U.S. Bancorp ( USB.N ) -- $551 million. It garnered about $277 million from the sale of shares in Visa's IPO. * Wells Fargo & Co ( WFC.N ) -- $544 million. It garnered about $273 million from the sale of shares in Visa's IPO. ** Source: Visa Inc amended registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
