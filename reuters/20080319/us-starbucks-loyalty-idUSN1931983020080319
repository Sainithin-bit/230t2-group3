 SEATTLE  (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp ( SBUX.O ) said on Wednesday it is rolling out a customer loyalty program that gives customers free coffee refills as well as free add-ons such as soy milk or flavored syrups. 

 The program will hit stores in the United States and in Canada in April, and be available to users of Starbucks prepaid cards or credit cards who register online. The refills cover drip coffee, the company said. Users will also receive a free small beverage of their choice with each pound of coffee purchased, Chief Executive Howard Schultz said.
