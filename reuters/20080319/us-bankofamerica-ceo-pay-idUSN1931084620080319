 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp( BAC.N ), the second-largest U.S. bank, said on Wednesday that Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis was awarded about $20.4 million of compensation in 2007, an 11 percent decline from a year earlier, as mortgage-related write-downs caused profit to fall. 

 According to a proxy filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the 60-year-old Lewis was awarded a $1.5 million salary, $11.07 million of restricted stock, $3.38 million worth of stock options, $4.25 million of non-equity incentives and $212,211 of other compensation. The latter included $127,643 related to personal use of corporate aircraft, and several other items. Lewis's reported compensation was about $22.85 million in the prior year. Compensation is based on salary, bonus, the value of stock options and other awards granted during the year, and incentives and perks. The values of the restricted stock and stock options were taken as of the date they were granted. Lewis also realized $14.17 million in 2007 from the vesting of 263,770 restricted shares, the filing shows. Profit at Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America fell 29 percent last year to $14.98 billion, or $3.30 per share, hurt by write-downs for collateralized debt obligations and rising credit losses. Lewis called the market environment the "toughest" since he took over in April 2001. The bank said its compensation and benefits committee concluded that 2007 performance "significantly missed" internal goals, especially in corporate and investment banking. Bank of America shares fell 23 percent last year, compared with a 25 percent drop in the Philadelphia KBW Bank Index .BKX. Other banks are also reporting lower compensation for their chief executives. For example, Charlotte-based Wachovia Corp WB.N, the fourth-largest U.S. bank, said Chief Executive Ken Thompson's compensation fell 14 percent to $15.65 million. Lewis has since October announced plans to cut more than 3,600 jobs, or about 2 percent of Bank of America's work force. In January, he announced plans to buy Countrywide Financial Corp CFC.N, the largest U.S. mortgage lender, for $4 billion. The same month, Bank of America sold $12.9 billion of preferred stock to bolster capital and help it absorb acquisitions. According to the proxy filing, compensation for other bank executives in 2007 included about $11.55 million for consumer banking chief Liam McGee; $9.59 million for technology and operations chief Barbara Desoer; $8.62 million for corporate and investment banking chief Brian Moynihan; $8.38 million for risk chief Amy Woods Brinkley; $5.78 million for Chief Financial Officer Joe Price; and $11.91 million for former vice chairman and Moynihan predecessor Eugene Taylor, who retired. Some of the executives' awards related to periods prior to 2007, the bank said. Bank of America also said its board urged the rejection at its April 23 annual meeting of three shareholder proposals related to executive compensation, including one that would give shareholders an advisory vote in setting pay.
