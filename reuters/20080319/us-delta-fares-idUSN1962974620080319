 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc ( DAL.N ) said on Wednesday it added another $10 to U.S. domestic round-trip fares to offset soaring jet fuel prices. 

 A spokeswoman for Delta, the No. 3 U.S. airline, said the $10 is an increase to the fuel surcharge. The hike comes on the heels of one from last week, when major carriers, including Delta, increased their fuel surcharges by as much as $50 round-trip. The increase reflects the pain that airlines are feeling as jet fuel prices, which rise with the price of oil, soar to record levels, and the U.S. economy weakens. A barrel of crude CLc1 touched a record high of $111.80 on Monday. On Tuesday, Delta unveiled plans to cut 2,000 jobs and scale back flights as it led efforts by U.S. carriers to cut costs. Delta, which has been unable to seal a merger with rival Northwest Airlines Corp NWA.N, will offer voluntary retirement and buyout packages to 30,000 employees. It is aiming to cut 1,300 rank-and-file jobs and 700 administrative and management jobs, or more than 3 percent of its work force overall. Delta shares were trading up about 2 percent at $10.30 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday morning. (Reporting by  Mark McSherry , editing by Gerald E. McCormick and Dave Zimmerman)
