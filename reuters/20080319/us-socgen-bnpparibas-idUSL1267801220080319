 PARIS  (Reuters) - French bank BNP Paribas ( BNPP.PA ) has walked away from a possible bid for rival Societe Generale ( SOGN.PA ), which is fighting to remain independent after suffering the world's biggest rogue trading scandal. 

 "Given the persistent rumors, BNP Paribas clarifies that it has ceased to consider a potential tie-up with Societe Generale," France's biggest listed bank said on Wednesday. The news punctured bid rumors that have swirled in the wake of 4.9 billion euros of trading losses that the bank blames on a lone junior trader, Jerome Kerviel. "If a French bank that knows the market doesn't want it, then it's unlikely that anyone else will," said Ion-Marc Valahu, head of trading at Amas Bank in Switzerland. SocGen shares fell as much as 8.2 percent, flicking away the speculative froth built into prices since SocGen announced the shock trading loss on January 24. The bank's stock fell at one point to its lowest intraday level since August 2004. BNP Paribas shares rose sharply as investors expressed relief that it would avoid stretching its resources in the midst of global financial market turmoil, analysts said. SocGen closed down 7.1 percent at 62.44 euros. The bank has a market capitalization of some 36 billion euros, including the effects of SocGen's recently completed capital increase. BNP closed up 4.7 percent to 60.76 euros, on another volatile day in a week which has seen Wall Street bank Bear Stearns BSC.N rescued from collapse. BNP has a stock market value of around 55 billion euros. "It's obviously bad news for SocGen shareholders. Nevertheless, it was expected and we had anticipated it since BNP would not have taken that much time if it really wanted to make a bid," said Iris Finance fund manager Michael Sellam, who holds SocGen shares. A source close to the matter said BNP Paribas came to its decision because of SocGen's opposition to any tie-up and as BNP would not make a hostile bid. In January BNP, which narrowly failed to buy SocGen in 1999, said it was looking at its rival. The source said uncertainty in financial markets over the credit crisis and the investigation into Kerviel also contributed to BNP's decision. "Trying to sell a deal like this in the current market environment is impossible," said the source. BNP said the conditions were not right for a deal to take place. It added it was well-placed to continue growing its business and would focus on its existing retail banking, investment banking and asset management services. SOCGEN NOT OUT OF WOODS Members of French President Nicolas Sarkozy's centre-right government have said they want SocGen to remain in French ownership, implying that BNP Paribas would have had an advantage over any foreign bank that might be interested in SocGen. In February, a source familiar with the matter said BNP Paribas executives had sounded out the French government over its possible bid for SocGen. Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers have been working with BNP. Goldman advised BNP in 1999 on its failed SocGen bid. Earlier this month French bank Credit Agricole ( CAGR.PA ) also said that although it was not planning any major takeovers this year, it would monitor the situation regarding SocGen. Some analysts have speculated over a break-up of SocGen between BNP Paribas and Agricole, with BNP getting SocGen's retail bank and Agricole the investment banking division. Despite calls from Sarkozy to resign, SocGen Chairman Daniel Bouton has remained in charge and last month he told Reuters he would continue with SocGen's standalone strategy. Although there has been no direct contact between SocGen and BNP, France's central bank has played a crucial role in stabilizing the situation and has been in touch with both sides. That, according to one source, gave SocGen Chairman Daniel Bouton ample opportunity to ensure Bank of France Governor Christian Noyer carried a clear message back to BNP: no deal. Bank mergers routinely need the blessing of central banks. SocGen this month completed a 5.5 billion euro rights issue to strengthen its balance sheet after the trading losses. However, some analysts said BNP might revisit SocGen later in the year and that the French bank would look to see whether SocGen posts poor first- and second-quarter results. "It makes sense for them to wait for SocGen to announce disappointing results," said an analyst at a U.S. investment bank who declined to be named. (Editing by David Cowell/Elaine Hardcastle)
