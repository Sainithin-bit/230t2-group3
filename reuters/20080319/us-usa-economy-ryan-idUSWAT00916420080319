 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury is confident that capital markets will recover from their current turbulence and emerge stronger with enhancements such as improved credit ratings, better disclosure and increased risk managment, a senior Treasury official said on Wednesday. 

 Anthony Ryan, Treasury assistant secretary for financial markets, said the markets were experiencing "a great deal of deleveraging" which has hurt liquidity and markets' ability to facilitate economic activities. "I have confidence in the resilience of our markets and that collectively, we will work through this period of stress, and make our markets even stronger," Ryan said in prepared remarks to the Exchequer Club in Washington.
