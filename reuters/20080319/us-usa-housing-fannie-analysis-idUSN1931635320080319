 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the top providers of funding for U.S. residential mortgages, got a free pass from the government to grow their businesses on Wednesday. 

 Shares of the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) have both jumped about 40 percent since last Friday, recovering some of their steep declines after reporting record losses in recent quarters. The about-face by investors in Fannie and Freddie resulted from the companies' regulator reducing the capital they must hold against assets, boosting their purchasing power by an estimated $200 billion. For the GSEs' basic businesses, the move was a gift. The companies investment portfolios that provide most of their profit have been locked around $1.4 trillion for three years. Fannie Mae's current portfolio balance is down 20 percent from 2004 when capital issues forced it to pare its balance sheet. "With less capital, the more they can grow," said Ed Walczak, a portfolio manager at New York-based Vontobel Asset Management, which owns a quarter-million shares of each GSE. GSE purchases may also have an indirect benefit on the ailing U.S. housing market, he said. Increasing portfolios may add up to 80 cents a share in earnings annually for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac if they don't have to raise more capital, according to Paul Miller, an analyst at Friedman, Billings Ramsey in Arlington, Virginia. But growth also makes the companies riskier, said Miller, who isn't budging on his "underperform" ratings. Miller and other critics are wary of how Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will deploy newfound capital in a housing market that by most estimates won't improve until 2009. This has sparked worry since the companies reported record losses in recent quarters even when they were restricted from playing a larger role in housing. "We believe credit losses will exceed the companies' guidance in 2008 and 2009, eroding capital" that has been won, UBS Securities' Eric Wasserstrom said on a research note. Write-downs and losses related to assets in the portfolios and guarantee obligations led to a $2.1 billion, or $2.63 per share, loss for Fannie Mae in 2007. Freddie Mac's loss totaled $3.1 billion, or $5.37 a share. Their earnings have a long way to go before matching the $4 billion-plus annual profit enjoyed during the rapid refinancing and low credit-loss period of the housing boom. The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight amended its capital rules since the companies have completed, or nearly completed improvements to accounting and risk reporting that led to accounting scandals in 2003 and 2004. The move appears to be a shift for the Bush administration that for years has cried that massive portfolios are a greater risk to the financial system than a help to the housing market. NOT NECESSARILY MORE RISK But the assumption that the GSEs will take on more risk may be short-sighted, analysts said. They may be focused on buying higher-quality assets, such as their own guaranteed mortgage bonds, that have been tainted by the credit crunch, they said. The GSEs will use the extra capital to try and "grow their way out of their problems" by buying high-quality mortgage assets via their guarantee programs versus the riskier loans responsible for the clamp-down on consumer lending, said Josh Rosner, a managing director at Graham Fisher in New York. New business for the companies promises higher profit since they have been increasing fees to compensate for credit risk. Freddie Mac said its guarantee fees will rise to the mid-30 basis point range this year from the high-teens in 2007. But with fewer capital restrictions, the GSEs have opened themselves up to Congress' demands to put themselves at risk as subprime mortgage defaults continue to undermine the U.S. housing market, he said. The GSEs "were in a position where they were hiding behind their regulator," Rosner said. "Now they can't do that with their handcuffs off." Freddie Mac Chief Executive Officer Richard Syron pledged to invest the money in the securities issued by the GSEs and so-called private-label MBS, which were issued on a ratings system via Wall Street banks such as Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and Bear Stearns Cos. Inc. The capital will also be used to develop programs that help people "most affected" by the housing slump, he said. Some of the rise in the two companies' stocks rise over the past week have been investors unwinding bearish bets, instead of outright buying, said Miller, who expects the rally is overdone. A less tangible but no less valuable result of OFHEO's capital ruling is the implicit support of the government whose policies have been hindering profit, he said. The notion that both Republicans and Democrats are leaning on the GSEs has strengthened their ties to the government, reducing the risk premiums investors recently demanded on their debt. There "is more to the thinking that the government will bail them out if they get into trouble," Miller said. (Additional reporting by  Mark Felsenthal ; editing by  Clive McKeef )
