 (Reuters) - General Motors Co ( GM.N ) will recall 249,260 midsize sport utility vehicles to correct a potential fire hazard, a U.S. government safety agency said. 
 GM, in a filing with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said the recall affected 2006-2007 Chevrolet Trailblazer and GMC Envoy SUVs, as well as certain 2007 Buick Rainier, Saab 9-7X and Isuzu Ascender SUVs. GM said a possible electrical short could affect power windows and door locks, and in some cases could cause a fire. (Reporting by Paul Lienert in Detroit; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
