 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Venezuela's state oil company 
PDVSA has suspended oil exports to Exxon Mobil ( XOM.N ) in 
retaliation for the U.S. oil company's legal action which 
resulted in temporary court rulings freezing billions of 
dollars of Venezuelan assets.  

 PDVSA said it will honor existing contracts relating to 
shared overseas investments with Exxon. The two share a 
refinery in Chalmette, Louisiana. Following is a list of crude oil imports by Exxon Mobil for 
November 2007, based on data from the U.S. government. All figures in 1,000s of barrels per day.
