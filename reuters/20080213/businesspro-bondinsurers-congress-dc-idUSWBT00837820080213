 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer and New 
York State Insurance Superintendent Eric Dinallo will testify 
Thursday at a House Financial Services subcommittee hearing on 
bond insurer problems, the panel said on Wednesday. 

  Also scheduled to testify at the hearing, which begins at 
11:30 a.m., are senior executives of Pershing Square Capital 
Management, Fitch Ratings, Ambac Financial Group ABK.N and 
MBIA Inc ( MBI.N ), the subcommittee said in a statement.  U.S. bond insurers, which guarantee more than $2.4 trillion 
of debt, have been hit with losses after insuring repackaged 
subprime mortgage securities.  (Reporting by  Julie Vorman , editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
