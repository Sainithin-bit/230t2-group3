 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co ( KO.N ), the world's largest maker of soft drinks, expects moderating impacts from currency fluctuations and commodity costs this year, a senior executive said on Wednesday. 

 Coke Chief Financial Officer Gary Fayard said currency fluctuations should have a "minimal impact" on operating income in 2008, while commodity costs should be flat for the company, but up slightly for the whole Coca-Cola system, which includes bottlers such as Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc ( CCE.N ). Fayard also said Coke plans $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion of capital expenditures in 2008 and plans to spend $1.5 billion to $2 billion buying back shares.
