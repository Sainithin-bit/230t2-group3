 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc ( DAL.N ) Chief Executive Officer Richard Anderson has told the airline's board he will waive compensation in the event of a merger. 

 A company spokesman said in a statement on Wednesday Anderson will "waive any accelerated compensation that he would otherwise be entitled to in the event of a merger." "The personnel and compensation committee of Delta's board of director has accepted his offer." News of Anderson's offer to the board was first reported in the Wall Street Journal which said he would have been  entitled to "millions of dollars" after a merger. Delta has been in discussions with Northwest Airlines Corp NWA.N according to people briefed on the situation who told Reuters a deal to combine the two airlines could be announced within weeks. On Tuesday, industry sources told Reuters talks between pilots at Northwest and Delta to reach an equity and seniority agreement ahead of any merger bid were said to be moving slowly. Anderson took over as chief executive of Delta on September 1 2007. Though he joined from UnitedHealth Group Inc ( UNH.N ) he had previously been chief executive of Northwest.
