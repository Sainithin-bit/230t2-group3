 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. financial industry slashed 52,500 jobs from July to December 2007, revealing how badly the subprime mortgage debacle has hurt the sector -- but New York-based companies hired 1,900 people at the same time, a report said on Wednesday. 

 However, the securities industry, which is concentrated in New York, is just one part of the overall financial sector that employs more than 6.1 million people and includes mortgage brokers and real estate credit companies. Mortgage and real estate lenders tend to be located outside New York. This explains why financial companies in the city were still adding staffers while around the nation these employers were cutting almost 1 percent of their workers, New York City Comptroller William Thompson explained in a quarterly economic report. Still, many of New York's securities companies have taken multibillion-dollar write-downs from sinking subprime mortgage investments and sliced 3,700 jobs in just the last three months of last year, Thompson said. New York City monitors Wall Street's fortunes because it supplies such a large share of its tax revenues, and city and state politicians are eager not to lose any more business to London and other global capitals. Financial employees make up about 11 percent of the city's total payroll employment, Thompson estimated. The city's hometown industry accounts for almost 35 percent of all salaries and wages -- an extraordinarily high figure that demonstrates just how well the average financial employee is paid. Many bankers and brokers earn a base salary of $200,000 or more and, in addition, get much bigger bonuses. "Our economy and employment rate rests heavily on the shoulders of Wall Street," Thompson said. "The subprime crisis has not yet affected unemployment levels in New York as dramatically as it has in other cities and states," he added, "but if its reach extends to the stock market this year, our financial future will become increasingly uncertain." Just how Wall Street fares depends greatly on the Federal Reserve, Thompson said, explaining that the U.S. central bank's policies only shielded the city from one out of the last three financial crises. New York was blistered by the 1987 stock market crash, the comptroller noted, because financial companies immediately began shrinking staffs. That trend lasted through the 1990 recession; some 85,000 jobs were lost by 1993. In contrast, the 1998 Asian debt crisis and the near-collapse of Long Term Capital Management had little lasting impact on the city's economy because the Fed stitched together a bailout for the hedge fund, he said. But the end of the technology bubble in 2000, coupled with rising interest rates, sent the nation into a recession, he said. The city had lost 9,600 jobs by August 2001 -- just a few weeks before the deadly September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center in the financial district. "The long-term combined loss of jobs from the attacks and recession stands at roughly 40,000," Thompson said. (Reporting by Joan Gralla; Editing by  Jonathan Oatis )
