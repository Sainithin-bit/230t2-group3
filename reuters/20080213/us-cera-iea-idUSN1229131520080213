 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - The head of the International Energy Agency said on Tuesday that OPEC should maintain current crude output levels in order to build up global oil stockpiles in the second quarter. 

 Nobuo Tanaka, speaking to reporters at the CERA energy conference in Houston, also said that agency will probably cut its forecast for world oil demand growth in 2008.
