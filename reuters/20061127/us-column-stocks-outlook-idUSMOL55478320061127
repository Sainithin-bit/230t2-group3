 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks could start the week lower after Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ), a key barometer of the U.S. retail sector, forecast a decline in monthly sales, signaling caution about the holiday shopping season. 

 Weakness in the dollar that sparked a sell-off on Friday could also cut demand for U.S. stocks. A full slate of economic data will influence the market this week as investors review reports on economic growth, inflation and consumer confidence. The week will wrap up with the latest sales figures from the struggling U.S. auto sector. The Wal-Mart forecast could put a damper on some retail shares, even though analysts and stores reported heavy traffic over the Thanksgiving weekend, the traditional start of the U.S. holiday shopping season, analysts said. Wal-Mart, the world's biggest retailer, estimated that November sales fell 0.1 percent at U.S. stores open at least a year. This would mark Wal-Mart's first monthly same-store sales decline since April 1996.  "Because of what Wal-Mart said, discount retailers are probably going to hurt a little bit come Monday morning. The ones that'll do well are the high-end and electronics retailers," said Marc Pado, U.S. market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in San Francisco. On Friday, U.S. stocks fell, retreating from highs earlier in the week, on concern that U.S. shares became less attractive to foreigners after a steep drop in the dollar. Last week, the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  fell 0.51 percent to end Friday at 12,280.17, while the Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  dipped 0.02 percent for the week and finished Friday's shortened trading session at 1,400.95. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  also declined modestly, closing at 2,460.26. But for the week, the Nasdaq advanced 0.59 percent. "We may be entering a period of trouble for stocks, and a sharp drop in the dollar may provide more excuses to sell," said Michael Metz, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Co. in New York. The dollar sank against the euro  EUR=  on Friday, propelling Europe's single currency up to around $1.31 for the first time since April 2005. Yet the three major U.S. stock indexes are up year to date. The Dow industrials index is up 14.58 percent for 2006 so far, while the S&P 500 has added 12.23 percent, and the Nasdaq has gained 11.56 percent. U.S. crude oil futures rose to almost $60 a barrel in thin electronic trading in London on Friday. The New York Mercantile Exchange was closed Thursday and Friday for the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday. On Wednesday, NYMEX January crude CLF7 settled at $59.24 a barrel -- up from $58.97 a week ago. RETAILERS GAIN ON BLACK FRIDAY Some major retail stocks rose on Friday, and those gains could be extended after positive reports of shopping activity on Saturday and Sunday. But analysts noted that retail shares have already bounced back from mid-July lows and are up more than 10 percent year to day. The Friday after Thanksgiving is known as "Black Friday" because retailers rang up enough sales to shift into "the black," or turned a profit for the year. It is considered to be the start of the Christmas shopping season. The Thanksgiving weekend accounts for 9 percent to 10 percent of holiday sales, according to data compiled by the Telsey Group, an independent research firm. The Standard & Poor's retail group expects a 4.5 percent increase in holiday retail sales for the traditional November-through-December period. <ID:nN24333041> In Friday's shortened trading session, shares of Federated Department Stores Inc. FD.N, which operates Macy's and Bloomingdale's, rose 4 cents to $43.11. Preppy clothing retailer J. Crew Group Inc. JCG.N turned in one of the best performances in the retail sector on Friday, when its stock shot up 6.8 percent, or $2.76, to $43.28. Staples Inc. ( SPLS.O ), the No. 1 office supplies retailer, on Sunday said traffic and sales exceeded expectations, helped by deeper inventory and efforts to make shopping easy. On Friday, Staples shares fell 1.1 percent to close at $25.62 on Nasdaq. DURABLE GOODS, HOMES AND GDP Reports on October durable goods orders and existing home sales for October as well as November consumer confidence will come out Tuesday, kicking off the week's heavy calendar of economic data. Economists polled by Reuters expect that durable goods orders fell 4.6 percent in October after an 8.3 percent jump in September. The pace of existing home sales is expected to slip in October to 6.15 million units on an annualized basis from September's 6.18 million. Economists see the Conference Board's November consumer confidence index at 106.0, up from October's 105.4. On Wednesday, the U.S. government will report preliminary third-quarter GDP figures, which include an inflation gauge called the core PCE index, widely followed by the Federal Reserve's policymakers. The forecasts, according to the Reuters poll, are that preliminary third-quarter GDP growth may be revised to an annual gain of 1.8 percent, up from 1.6 percent reported previously. The reading on core personal consumption expenditure prices, or core PCE prices, excluding food and energy, is expected to be a gain of 2.3 percent in the third quarter, matching the rate previously reported. New home sales for October, due Wednesday, are forecast to dip to an annual pace of 1.044 million units from September's 1.075 million. On Thursday, the government will release a monthly reading on the core PCE price index as part of the October data on personal income and personal consumption. Economists polled by Reuters expect the core PCE price index to rise 0.1 percent in October after a 0.2 percent gain in September. November domestic car and truck sales on Friday will conclude the week's data blitz. Domestic car sales are expected to rise to a pace of 5.30 million units in November from October's 5.10 million. Domestic truck sales are likely to increase to 7.30 million units in November from October's rate of 7.20 million.
