 MEXICO CITY  (Reuters) - A plan by Wal-Mart's Mexican unit to open a bank will help make the country's financial industry more competitive, the International Monetary Fund's chief economist said on Monday. 

 Wal-Mart de Mexico ( WALMEXV.MX ), controlled by Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ), said last week it expects to launch a bank next year, Wal-Mart's first banking operation anywhere. "I was heartened the other day to see that Wal-Mart has now been allowed to offer loans," IMF chief economist Raghuram Rajan said at an event in Mexico City. In the United States, Wal-Mart has run into problems trying to open a consumer lending operation over fears the mammoth retailer could muscle out one-branch banks in small towns. But Mexico's banking market has plenty of room for new players, the government says. After a wave of buyouts in recent years, it is dominated by a handful of large foreign banks like BBVA ( BBVA.MC ), Citigroup ( C.N ), Santander ( SAN.MC ) and HSBC ( HSBA.L ). While foreign-owned banks have breathed new life into Mexico's financial system after an economic crisis in 1995, critics complain they should be more competitive. The central bank accuses them of charging unreasonably high fees and interest rates, and the country's anti-trust watchdog has warned it is closely watching the sector. The government hopes banks run by Wal-Mart Mexico and its competitors will focus on low-income consumers, a sector the big banks have largely ignored. Greater competition in the financial sector would be a step toward reducing the vast gap between Mexico's rich and poor, Rajan said. "It seems to me that creating different entities to compete is part of the answer," he said. Critics have warned that fast growth of retail banks in Mexico could lead to problems, such as retailers dipping into their banks for cash. "In the process of allowing more competition you also have to have the supervisory sector have a handle on how things are growing, which means more efforts there," Rajan said.
