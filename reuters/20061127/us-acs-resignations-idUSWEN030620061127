 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Affiliated Computer Services Inc. ( ACS.N ) said on Monday its chief executive and chief financial officer had resigned as it completed an internal investigation into its stock option practices. 

 ACS, a business process outsourcing and information technology company, said it expects a non-cash compensation expense related to incorrect accounting measurement dates of approximately $51 million, plus additional tax-related expenses. The investigation was initiated in response to an informal inquiry by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and a subpoena from a grand jury in the Southern District of New York, the company said. The probe reviewed ACS's stock option practices from 1994 through 2005. ACS said the investigation concluded that "certain conduct" of CEO Mark King and CFO Warren Edwards "violated the company's code of ethics for senior financial officers." Both resigned, effective November 26, the statement said, and have entered into separation agreements with the company. A call to the company seeking comment from the two executives was not immediately returned. The Wall Street Journal reported on its Web site that in a statement, King's lawyer Karen Seymour said her client voluntarily resigned as CEO and "cooperated fully" with the investigation. She added: "He acted at all times in good faith and did not engage in any intentional misconduct," the paper said. The paper reported that Gary Naftalis, a lawyer for Edwards, said his client cooperated "fully and forthrightly" with the probe and helped find and guide the investigators to relevant documents. Naftalis noted that Edwards did not become chief financial officer until 2001, years after the problems apparently started. "He engaged in no intentional misconduct and acted in good faith at all times in connection with the company's longstanding and historic options granting practices," Naftalis said, according to the paper. The two lawyers were not immediately available for comment. More than 150 companies have launched internal investigations or are the subject of probes by the Securities and Exchange Commission to determine if the dates of stock options were manipulated. NEW EXECUTIVES ACS said its board had appointed its Chief Operating Officer Lynn Blodgett as President and CEO, and its Executive Vice President of Corporate Development, John Rexford, as CFO, effective immediately. It said it was continuing to review the results of the investigation to determine the accounting consequences of the use of incorrect measurement dates during 1994 through 2005. The non-cash expense of $51 million "may increase or decrease when finalized", it said. It added that it had not yet determined the impact of the accounting adjustments on its financial statements "nor whether it will be required to restate its consolidated financial statements as a result of these adjustments". It said it had informed the SEC and U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York of the results and would "continue to cooperate with these governmental entities and their investigations".
