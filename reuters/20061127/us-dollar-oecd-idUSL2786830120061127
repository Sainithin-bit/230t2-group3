 MADRID  (Reuters) - Excessive weakening of the U.S. dollar could lead to interest rate hikes in the United States, Europe and Japan and hurt global economic growth, OECD Secretary General Angel Gurria said on Monday. 

 The imbalance between a huge current account deficit in the United States and surpluses in Asian countries and oil exporting states is prompting investors to move out of the dollar, Gurria said. "What is happening now is a manifestation of this process," Gurria told reporters in Madrid after meeting Spain's Foreign Minister in Madrid. "If the dollar falls in a disorderly or excessive fashion, it will trigger rate hikes in the United States and this could be reflected by rate hikes in Europe and/or Japan, and growth could slow," he added. Earlier, the dollar hit a 20-month low before strengthening back to $1.3116 to the euro. Gurria said the United States was not doing enough to lower its current account deficit, even though strong U.S. growth had allowed the country to cut its fiscal deficit. "You've got to ask the question whether anyone is worried or not, if the issue is being resolved," said Gurria. "The current account deficit continues." The Paris-based OECD is due to publish its twice-yearly world economic outlook on Tuesday. Gurria added that a stronger euro -- against both the U.S. dollar and Asian currencies -- posed risks for Europe. "It's a very important challenge in terms of competitiveness and productivity (for Europe) in terms of maintaining its position in international markets," Gurria said.
