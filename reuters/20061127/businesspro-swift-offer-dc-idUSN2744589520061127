 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Trucking company Swift Transportation 
Co. Inc. SWFT.O said on Monday it rejected a $2.2 billion 
buyout proposal from former Chief Executive Jerry Moyes, but 
added it is willing to discuss higher bids. 

  Swift shares rose more than 3 percent after the 
announcement as analysts said it could lead to a better offer 
from Moyes, who is also the company's largest shareholder.  In a statement the Phoenix-based company described the 
all-cash offer of $29 per share offer made Nov 6 as 
"inadequate."  The truckload carrier said a special committee set up to 
analyze the offer would continue to explore alternatives, 
including discussions with other possible buyers, and would try 
to convince Moyes to raise his bid.  After Moyes' bid the stock rose to $29.80 in early 
November. It has since fallen back and closed on Friday at 
$27.61 on Nasdaq.  Analysts said at the time that the bid might undervalue the 
company, which operates a fleet of 18,000 tractors and 52,000 
trailers, because trucking company stocks had been hurt in 
recent months by fears of an economic slowdown.  Moyes has already said he could be persuaded to pay more 
than $29 per share and consider any factors the company might 
believe would support a higher price.  Swift said on Monday that the special committee, which is 
being advised by Goldman Sachs, would begin discussions with 
Moyes to see if he will raise his bid. In addition, the company 
said it began discussions with other potential bidders.  The company gave no timetable for discussions or any 
decision on a possible takeover.  In a research note, UBS transportation analyst Rick 
Paterson said that Swift's announcement "leaves the door open" 
for a higher offer.  Shares were up 67 cents at $28.28, down from a high for the 
day of $28.50.
