 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Holiday shoppers rushed the doors of apparel retailers including Aeropostal Inc. over the U.S. Thanksgiving weekend, anxious to snag some of the best deals of the year. But while traffic rose, the sharp discounts could actually hurt the companies' bottom lines. 

 Brean Murray Carret & Co analyst Eric Beder cut his rating on teen clothing retailer Aeropostal to "sell" from "hold" saying the company's 50-percent-off-everything holiday discounts suggested the company relies too heavily on sales to drive traffic and may hurt its brand image. "We also believe the discounts will materially limit any potential gross margin expansion in the fourth quarter, especially if the current (promotions) are carried out throughout the holidays," wrote Beder in a research note. An Aeropostal representative was not immediately available to comment. In contrast, less-promotional companies won kudos from the Bear Stearns analyst team, which said that slim discounts at companies such as Abercrombie & Fitch Co. and American Eagle Outfitters Inc. would maintain strong margins. Companies such as Limited Brands Inc. that offered a gift with purchase, rather than a steep discount, also won applause. "We believe Limited Brands was one of the strongest performers on Black Friday as consumers responded to the gift with purchase events at Victoria's Secret, Bath & Body Works, Express and Limited," wrote Bear Stearns analyst Randal Konik, in a note. Black Friday refers to the Friday after Thanksgiving. The day, considered the kickoff to the holiday spending period, was once the period most retailers would turn a profit for the year. Savvy merchandising and inventory changes have made it less important, but it's still considered one of the most-important selling days of the year. And there were some apparel companies for whom promotions of any level likely didn't reverse their overall strength or weakness. Gap Inc., for one, offered less-aggressive markdowns, which could protect its profit margins, but analysts and investors still weren't impressed. The company, which operates the Banana Republic, Old Navy and namesake Gap stores, cut 30 percent from the price of any item off $50 or more, for early shoppers. But in his trips to malls, Todd Slater of Lazard Capital Markets noted that Gap's "Black Friday weekend was likely below plan for the brand, with inconsistent traffic and conversion rates." Slater made his comments in a note to clients. The company told Reuters it could not comment on revenue or traffic trends, noting it will announce November sales results on Thursday, November 30. Gap Inc. representative Greg Rossiter said only that Banana Republic dresses were a popular holiday item and that the Old Navy Sherpa line of winter wear was also in demand. The company declined to comment on the highly promoted hoodies at the Gap chain. And AnnTaylor Stores Corp. failed to draw in many more customers, despite a sale on cashmere at its Ann Taylor and Loft stores, according to Banc of America Securities analyst Dana Cohen. An AnnTaylor representative was not immediately available to comment. "You already know it's a high traffic day," said Laura Richardson, a consumer analyst at BB&T Capital Markets, in an interview on Saturday. "What I'm looking at is traffic relative to what I'm use to seeing and the promotional efforts retailers are making. A lot of companies I follow are cutting (prices) more than last year and not getting great traffic. That's not a great sign for sales or profits." Representatives for Aeropostal and AnnTaylor were not immediately available for comment. The Dow Jones U.S. retail and apparel index was down 0.5 percent in early trading on Monday.
