 LONDON  (Reuters) - Shares on Wall Street looked set to open flat on Monday following last weeks dollar weakness that raised questions about the continued attractiveness of U.S. equities to foreign buyers. 

 By 1000 GMT, U.S. stock futures SPc1 DJc1 NDc1 were barely changed, suggesting a mediocre start. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  closed 0.38 percent lower on Friday, while the broad S&P Index  .SPX  dropped 0.37 percent. It came as the dollar fell sharply against major currencies. Angus Campbell, market strategist at Finspreads in London, suggested in a note that investors may reckon the stock price drop "simply presents a buying opportunity". But Wall Street investors face a challenging week with a raft of economic data ahead, starting with October durable goods orders and existing home sales for October plus November consumer confidence on Tuesday.
