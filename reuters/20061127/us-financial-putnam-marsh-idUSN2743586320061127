 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Marsh & McLennan Cos. Inc. ( MMC.N ) could be in a good position to get an impressive price for its Putnam Investments money management arm, despite some recent troubles at the unit, the Wall Street Journal reported on its Web site on Monday. 

 Bids were expected last week from at least three firms, including fund manager Amvescap Plc. AVZ.L, Italian bank Unicredit ( CRDI.MI ) and Power Corp of Canada ( POW.TO ), the paper said. The final decision as to which, if any, bid to accept could take several weeks more, it reported, adding that spokespeople for Marsh & McLennan, Unicredit, Power Corp. and Amvescap had declined to comment on their plans. Marsh's Chief Executive Michael Cherkasky said earlier this month that Putnam had positive flows in October for the first time in three years. Cherkasky has said he expects more investment into the Boston-based fund unit by the end of the year, following a long decline in investment after a scandal hurt the company before he took charge. The WSJ said the company is considered likely to garner a higher premium than the 2 percent of assets sometimes called a benchmark price for asset managers. The paper said C. Meyrick Payne, a senior partner with Management Practice Inc., called a Putnam deal unusual in that "such a star name doesn't become available very often," and said that despite the company's recent difficulties, its name recognition would help it draw a better price. He said a likely premium could range from around 2 percent, with an "upper limit" of around 6 percent. A 2 percent premium on Putnam's $187 billion in assets would put the price at around $3.74 billion.
