 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - IAC/InterActiveCorp. ( IACI.O ) Chief 
Executive Barry Diller said on Monday the company's HSN home 
shopping network is poised to close the gap with rival Liberty 
Media's ( LINTA.O ) QVC over the next 18 months. 

  "What I would say is that HSN, which has been growing over 
these 10 years, but has never been particularly competitive 
with QVC (shopping network), is at a stage now where I would 
say it might be more competitive to its far larger player," 
Diller told the Reuters Media Summit in New York.  "That tale will be told in the next 18 months," Diller 
said, talking about a move to stronger growth. "While I think 
we have great new leadership ... it's not yet in evidence.  IAC is reshaping its HSN retail segment, and also aims to 
keep costs down for its LendingTree.com mortgage business amid 
a weak U.S. real estate market.  Diller's Internet media conglomerate has seen profits grow 
with strong revenue from its Ticketmaster ticketing service 
business and online dating service Match.com.  IAC's search and media business includes Ask.com and 
Citysearch, which compete with industry leaders Google Inc. 
( GOOG.O ) and Yahoo Inc. ( YHOO.O ).  IAC is slated to join the S&P 500 Index  .SPX  after the 
close of trading on November 30, joining a list of stocks 
watched by many portfolio managers who try to track the index.  The company's share has outperformed that index since the 
beginning of the year, with a 25 percent increase compared with 
a 12 percent gain for the S&P 500.
