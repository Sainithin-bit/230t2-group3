 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Affiliates controlled by billionaire Carl Icahn and real estate magnate Harry Macklowe together own more than 5 percent of Reckson Associates Realty Corp.RA.N, the New York office building owner the two are vying to buy, according to a Monday regulatory filing. 

 In a letter to Reckson dated November 26, a representative of Rome Acquisition L.P., the unit set up by Macklowe and Icahn to buy Reckson, stated the ownership, which investors had speculated about since the two made their bid known on November 16.
