 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - With Black Friday in the rear-view mirror -- complete with eye-popping bargains and frenzied shoppers lining up overnight to buy that "must-have" 42-inch plasma television -- Wall Street now looks to Thursday to find out whether heavy markdowns took a toll on sales and profits. 

 Many major retailers will report November sales at stores open at least a year, a closely watched retail measure known as same-store sales, on that day. Investors will also be looking for any change in fourth-quarter profit forecasts. The weekend following Thanksgiving Day represents about 10 percent of retail sales for the entire holiday season, according to Lehman Brothers. But for apparel retailers, most of the sales in the fourth quarter, which runs from November to January, come in December, so any comments on how trends look for the upcoming month will be closely watched. Analysts said that consumer electronics were the brisk sellers over the weekend. But the top chains, such as Best Buy Co Inc. and Circuit City Stores Inc., won't be reporting their results on Thursday. Despite deep discounts on popular items like flat-panel televisions, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world's largest retailer, posted a 0.1 percent decline in November same-store sales when it released preliminary figures on Saturday. It will issue its final monthly report on Thursday. "We believe many retailers' strong sales trends over the Thanksgiving weekend can be attributed to aggressive discounting and promotions," said Bear Stearns analyst Christine Augustine. She expects November same-store sales growth in the low- to mid-single-digits at department stores and discounters, except for Wal-Mart. "While the holiday shopping season appears to be off to a strong start for most retailers, it is still early," Credit Suisse analyst Gary Balter wrote in a note to clients. Christmas falls on a Monday this year, so consumers looking for last-minute deals have a final weekend to shop. In recent years, the Saturday before Christmas has become the biggest shopping day of the year, supplanting the Friday after Thanksgiving, known as Black Friday. Balter said that many retailers' shares have risen nicely since July, "leaving less upside even in a good season," and "even with lower oil prices, consumers may get higher home heating bills." The S&P Retail Index, which does not include Wal-Mart, has risen 18.3 percent in the past three months. The index slipped 0.4 percent in midday trading on Monday. Shares of Wal-Mart fell 1.8 percent to $47.04. NIGHT OWLS, EARLY BIRDS More retailers decided to open their doors at midnight on Thanksgiving night or even earlier to capture eager shoppers. Wal-Mart started its heavy discounting weeks before Thanksgiving, while other retailers beefed up their promotions just ahead of Black Friday. Goldman Sachs analyst Adrianne Shapira said the competitive landscape suggests that Wal-Mart "pulled back the pace of its promotions to preserve profits" going into the key weekend after getting consumers' attention with early advertisements. Or, the "rest of the world caught up in promotions when it mattered and margins were hit across the board." She said investors will have to wait to see fourth-quarter results to judge how Wal-Mart's strategy played out. Shapira found that customer traffic was up strongly at Target Corp. stores, which could help it reach its goal of 4 percent to 7 percent same-store sales growth in November. Malls were also more crowded, with Federated Department Stores Inc.'s Macy's chain posting a 17 percent rise in customer traffic, according to Goldman Sachs. J.C. Penney Co. Inc. issued a statement on Saturday saying that "the holiday season is off to a good start" with "brisk traffic" in its stores. Analysts said that sharp discounts on apparel could hurt bottom lines. Brean Murray analyst Eric Beder cut his rating on teen clothing retailer Aeropostale Inc. to "sell" from "hold," saying a 50-percent-off-everything discount suggested it was relying too heavily on sales to drive traffic. Gap Inc. offered less aggressive markdowns. The company, which operates Gap, Banana Republic, Old Navy and Forth & Towne stores, cut 30 percent off any item priced $50 or more for early shoppers at its namesake Gap chain.
