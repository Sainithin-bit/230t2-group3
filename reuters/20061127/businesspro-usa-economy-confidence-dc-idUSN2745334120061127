 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Investor confidence in the U.S. 
economy surged to its highest level in 10 months, buoyed by a 
stock market rally and fading worries over energy prices, a 
survey showed on Monday. 

  The UBS/Gallup Index of Investor Optimism jumped 14 points 
to 93, its highest reading since January, when it also reached 
93. The index, which has risen 40 points during the past three 
months, was 79 in October.  "The recent stabilization in gasoline prices has clearly 
impacted investors' outlook on the economy as more money has 
been kept in investors' pockets," said Mike Ryan, Head of UBS 
Wealth Management Research Americas.  Energy price concerns fell to 54 percent, the lowest level 
since measurement started in March 2004. In August, 78 percent 
of the respondents believed that energy prices were hurting the 
economy.  Investors' perception of the economy also improved in 
November, with 46 percent of the respondents saying they were 
experiencing a "recovery" or an "economic expansion," compared 
to 43 percent in October.  About 41 percent of respondents believe the economy is in a 
"slowdown." This compares to 44 percent in October. Only one in 
10 investors believes the economy is in recession.  "The continued stock market rally is also fueling investor 
optimism, offsetting worries about other sectors, especially 
the housing market," said Ryan.  The survey showed that investors remained concerned about 
situation in the residential real estate market, with many 
convinced that conditions will continue to worsen before 
improving.  The UBS/Gallup survey covers about 800 households from 
around the U.S. with investments of $10,000 or more. Nearly 40 
percent of American Households have at least this amount of 
savings and investments.
