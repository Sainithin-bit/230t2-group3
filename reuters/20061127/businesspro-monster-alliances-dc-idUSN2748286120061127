 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Monster Worldwide Inc. ( MNST.O ), 
parent of jobs Web site Monster.com, has signed several 
partnership deals with newspapers covering help-wanted 
advertising in local markets, Monster said on Monday. 

  New partners include privately held Freedom Communications 
Inc., North Jersey Media Group, the Wilkes-Barre Times Leader 
serving northern Pennsylvania, and the Honolulu Star-Bulletin, 
Monster said.  Monster will provide recruitment services to Freedom's 
newspaper and television properties, including the Orange 
County Register in California, and eight TV stations. It will 
also launch co-branded Internet sites as part of the alliances.  Monster said the partnerships are part of a strategy of 
media alliances in local markets, targeting small and 
medium-sized businesses.  Its media alliances now include 43 daily newspapers and 
eight television properties, the company said. Monster earlier 
this year struck similar deals in Philadelphia and in Akron, 
Ohio, and said Monday that the Philadelphia deal has increased 
page views on the philly.com careers page by 25 percent.  Monster's announcements come a week after Yahoo Inc. 
( YHOO.O ) struck a deal with publishers of 176 newspapers to let 
them use its technology to sell help-wanted advertising. 
Yahoo's HotJobs services competes with Monster.com and with 
CareerBuilder.com, which is owned by Gannett Co. Inc. ( GCI.N ), 
Tribune Co. TRB.N and McClatchy Co. ( MNI.N ) .  Monster shares were down $1.29, or 2.9 percent, at $43.34 
in afternoon trading on the Nasdaq.
