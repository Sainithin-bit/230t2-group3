 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Heavy discounts and "door-buster" promotions sent more than 140 million U.S. shoppers to stores during the three-day kickoff to holiday shopping, but overall customer traffic was seen falling from last year, a retail trade group said on Sunday. 

 Despite the drop-off, the National Retail Federation (NRF) estimated the average shopper spent 19 percent more than last year -- or $360.15 versus $302.81. Although long lines outside malls started on Thursday for coveted items such as high-definition televisions, Mattel Inc.'s T.M.X. Elmo toy and hot game consoles from Nintendo Co. Ltd. and Sony Corp., analysts were unimpressed by overall traffic levels. "I didn't really notice the very impressive traffic numbers that one would hope for," said Morgan Keegan analyst Brad Stephens, who tracked malls in Atlanta on Saturday and Sunday. "I think it kind of slowed as the weekend went on." Analyst Liz Pierce of Roth Capital Partners said she "didn't see people shopping with total abandon." NRF spokeswoman Kathy Grannis said shoppers concentrated their mall shopping trips this year versus 2005, when some 145 million shoppers took to the malls over the three-day weekend. "This year the weather was so great we think people stayed (away) during the weekend and hit the stores on Friday as opposed to the rest of the weekend," Grannis said. The rise in spending may be due to the popularity of big-ticket electronics items, such as gaming systems, plasma televisions and digital cameras. Visa USA said the average ticket for electronics rose nearly 9 percent on "Black Friday," the day after Thanksgiving and one of retail's busiest days. Visa estimated total holiday spending, including gas and restaurant sales but excluding auto sales, will rise 7.5 percent in November and December. Demand for electronics was fed by retailers like Best Buy Co. Inc. and Comp USA, which opened their doors to a crush of early-bird shoppers. Creative Strategies analyst Tim Bajarin said his weekend checks to malls showed strong sales of Apple Computer Inc.'s iPod, which could bode well for Apple's quarterly results. WAL-MART SEES SALES DECLINE But retailers may face investor skepticism in light of disappointing November same-store sales estimates from Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world's largest retailer. Wal-Mart said it expected a 0.1 percent drop in sales at established stores, which would mark its first monthly same-store sales decline since April 1996. "It may make investors nervous on the (retail) space," said Pacific Growth Equities analyst Christine Chen. The NRF, which expects holiday sales to increase 5 percent this year to $457.4 billion, said while discounters like Wal-Mart were the most visited by consumers this holiday weekend, traffic was down from the prior year. Nearly 50 percent of shoppers visited discount stores during the weekend, compared with nearly 61 percent last year, the NRF survey found. While apparel, books, CDs, DVDs and video games were the most popular, 33 percent of shoppers picked up consumer electronics or computer-related accessories, the NRF said. Staples, whose specials included a Canon Powershot A540 6-megapixel camera with a photo printer for $199, said traffic and sales exceeded expectations. "Online and in-store traffic and dollar spend were very strong, right out of the chute," Dave Perron, Staples' executive vice president of merchandising and supply chain, said Sunday. "There were strong increases in both from last year." (Additional reporting by  Martinne Geller )
