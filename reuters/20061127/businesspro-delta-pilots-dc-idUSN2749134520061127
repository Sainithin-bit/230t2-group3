 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bankrupt Delta Air Lines Inc. 
DALRQ.PK said on Monday its creditors agreed to allow the 
carrier to give retired pilots an additional $719 million in 
pre-petition claims to help them recoup lost pension benefits. 

  The announcement comes as Delta, the No. 3 U.S. carrier, 
faces an unsolicited $8.7 billion takeover bid by US Airways 
Group ( LCC.N ).  In all, retired Delta pilots will now have a total of about 
$800 million in allowed claims, the airline said in a 
statement. The agreement with Delta's official committee of 
unsecured creditors is subject to bankruptcy court approval.  The Atlanta-based airline, which has been operating under 
bankruptcy protection since September 2005, expects to end its 
pilots' defined benefit pension plan effective September 2, 
2006.  The unsecured claim, which could take the form of equity or 
some other kind of security in a reorganized airline, would 
help the retirees recoup some of the loss, the airline said.  "Our retired pilots will recover through the claim process 
a significant portion of their unpaid non-qualified benefits," 
Delta Chief Financial Officer Edward Bastian said in a 
statement.
