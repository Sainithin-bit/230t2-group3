 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Palm Inc. PALM.O cut 
second-quarter profit and revenue forecasts on Monday, blaming 
a delay in shipping its new Treo 750 smartphone in the United 
States. 

  The company's shares fell as much as 10 percent in extended 
trading following the announcement, after closing down 3.4 
percent at $15.37 in regular-session trading on Nasdaq, giving 
it a market value of about $1.6 billion.  Palm now expects to start shipping the Treo 750 in the 
United States in the fiscal third quarter instead of the 
current quarter when it expected the device would help boost 
sales.  It blamed the lower forecasts mainly on a delay by a U.S. 
cellphone carrier in ensuring the Treo 750 is compatible with 
the carrier's network. It declined to name the carrier.  But the company said the launch of a version of the device 
in Europe "is doing quite well" and forecast international 
revenue in the second quarter should be strong.  The Treo 750 runs on Microsoft Corp.'s ( MSFT.O ) operating 
system, while another new model, the Treo 680, uses Palm's 
operating system.  Palm now expects to report net income for its fiscal second 
quarter of 10 cents to 11 cents per share -- down from an 
earlier forecast of 15 cents to 18 cents per share.  Earnings before certain items are seen at 15 cents to 16 
cents per share, compared with a September forecast of 20 cents 
to 23 cents per share, Palm said. Analysts, on average, were 
expecting earnings per share before items of 22 cents, 
according to Reuters Estimates.  Palm said it expects to report revenue of $390 million to 
$395 million, down from its earlier forecast of $430 million to 
$450 million and below Wall Street's view of $442.3 million.  Palm spokeswoman Marlene Somsak declined to identify the 
carrier responsible for the delay.  "There are many, many steps and myriad attributes about the 
certification process," Somsak said. "The phones have to be 
super well-tuned to the network."  Sunnyvale, California-based Palm expects to report detailed 
quarterly results on December 19.  Palm shares were down 4.9 percent at $14.62 in extended 
trading after falling as low as $13.90.
