 PARIS  (Reuters) - Euronext's ENXT.PA $15 billion merger plan with NYSE Group NYX.N has been "sensibly modified" but discussions between the two exchanges must continue, French Finance Minister Thierry Breton said on Monday. 

 Breton did not elaborate. He made the comments at a Euromoney conference in Paris. Euronext and NYSE announced last week that their combined board would contain an equal number of Americans and Europeans. This followed calls by Breton and powerful French financial lobby Europlace for a fairer merger.
