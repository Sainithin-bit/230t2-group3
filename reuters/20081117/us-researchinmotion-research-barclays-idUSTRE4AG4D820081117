 (Reuters) - Barclays Capital cut its price target on BlackBerry maker Research In Motion's RIM.TO RIMM.O stock to $60 from $90, and said it expects a 5 percent decline in global handset units sales from prior forecasts of 3 percent growth in 2009. 

 Barclays cut its smartphone growth estimate to 25 percent from 40 percent amid a rapidly deteriorating retail climate and Nokia Oyj's ( NOK1V.HE ) reduced forecast. Last week, Nokia said 1.24 billion phones would be sold worldwide this year, down from a previous estimate of 1.26 billion, and said handset market volumes and the overall telecommunications equipment market was expected to fall next year. [ Barclays analyst Jeff Kvaal cut his estimates on Research In Motion, citing the slowing demand for smartphones, offset partially by the company's third-quarter phone launches. "RIM's four new device launches should partially balance the weak market," Kvaal wrote in a note to clients. Shares of Research In Motion were trading up 80 cents at $40.80 early Monday morning on Nasdaq. (Reporting by Shrutika Verma in Bangalore; Editing by  Pratish Narayanan )
