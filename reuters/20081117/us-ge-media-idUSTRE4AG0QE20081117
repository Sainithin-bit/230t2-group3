 (Reuters) - General Electric Co ( GE.N ) has the resources to capitalize on bargains in media and other sectors as it wades through the economic downturn, chief executive Jeffrey Immelt told the Financial Times in an interview. 

 "There are going to be some opportunities in media consolidation, in infrastructure, oil and gas, aviation," Immelt told the paper. "And my hope is that we can play in some of those as time goes on." GE, owner of NBC Universal Inc, has restructured itself substantially over Immelt's seven years at the helm but its shares slumped to their lowest level since 1996 earlier this month as the global credit crisis hit its finance arm.
