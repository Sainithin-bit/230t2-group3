 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil inventories rose sharply last week while gasoline stocks showed an unexpected build, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration released on Wednesday. 

 Distillate stocks fell more than expected in the week to September 26. HIGHLIGHTS FROM EIA REPORT (In million barrels): - Crude +4.3 (forecast +2.4) - Distillate -2.3 (forecast -1.2) - Gasoline +0.9 (forecast -1.6) ANALYST COMMENTS CHRIS JARVIS, SENIOR ANALYST, CAPROCK RISK MANAGEMENT, NEW HAMPSHIRE: "Strong imports and sluggish demand resulting from cash price spikes and an ailing economy more than offset the shut-ins resulting from hurricanes Gustav and Ike." "Overall the only bullish component of today's data was the distillates number, which showed a bigger-than-expected drop. The spike in imports should keep the bears somewhat in check as inventory levels in gasoline remain at historic lows." "On a macro front, all eyes will remain on the $700 billion package going to vote in the Senate tonight and possibly back in the House the second half of the week. Failure to pass would put pressure across the board, while passing of the package would likely create a relief rally." TIM EVANS, ENERGY ANALYST, CITI FUTURES PERSPECTIVE, NEW YORK: "The overall tenor of the EIA report was bearish relative to expectations, with a larger-than-expected 4.3 million barrels build in crude stocks on a big 1.8 million barrels per day jump in imports. The build in gasoline stocks was also a surprise, with production reported up 736,000 bpd from the prior week versus demand that was 11,000 bpd lower. The distillates draw was larger than expected, but not a full offset to the other data." MARK WAGGONER, PRESIDENT, EXCEL FUTURES, HUNTINGTON BEACH, CALIFORNIA: "The EIA numbers are not too far from what the market forecast and so people will still be looking at developments in Congress about the financial rescue package. The market is on a wait-and-see attitude in this regard and we might see crude prices fall toward $90, if not today, tomorrow perhaps. I still see the financial bailout passing Congress, but the House of Representatives' approving it is the tough part. The markets are still keyed on all that's happening in Washington." AMANDA KURZENDOERFER, COMMODITIES ANALYST, SUMMIT ENERGY,  LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY "Crude and gasoline inventories built, so that was bearish for the market overall. Distillates fell -- distillate inventories usually begin to decline at this time of year. "Distillate inventories are at the bottom of the five-year range, but they usually begin to drop (around this time of year), so it is not as concerning as it might have been a few weeks ago. Demand is pretty weak, I think that is what is keeping it from being supportive." MARK KELLSTROM, ANALYST, STRATEGIC ENERGY RESEARCH, SUMMIT, NJ "The numbers look bearish. Recent EIA data about U.S. demand has also been negative. This probably continues to weigh on crude prices. But we would say that inventories are still relatively low compared to five-year averages. Gasoline stocks are near 40-year lows. On crude prices, we're gonna find out ... whether demand fears can be overcome by federal fiscal bailouts and central bank inflation."
