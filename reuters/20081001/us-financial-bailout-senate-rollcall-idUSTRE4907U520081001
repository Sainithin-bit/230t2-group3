 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - When the U.S. Senate votes on Wednesday night on a $700 billion rescue plan for the reeling financial sector, decorum will rule and those following the results will have to listen carefully. 

 Unlike the sometimes raucous 435-member House of Representatives, where votes are cast electronically and a running tally is plastered on C-SPAN television, the 100-member Senate follows a more arcane process. Senators in the chamber hear their name called aloud and vote by catching the eye of the clerk who tallies the result by hand. "They usually say 'aye' or 'nay' or sometimes give a thumbs up or thumbs down," said Donald Ritchie, associate Senate historian. "The clerk reads it back." One senator who was ill during a vote some time ago even pointed to his eye to vote yes, Ritchie said. The Senate voting process is televised live on C-SPAN, a public service television outlet, and the fate of a measure is followed by listening to the clerk after each member votes. Once voting is gaveled to a close, the clerk records and then reads aloud the tally. Senate leaders do not say how long a vote will take but most last about 15 to 20 minutes. Unlike in the House, controversial bills in the Senate usually require a 60-vote majority to first end debate before proceeding to the actual measure. A simple majority of senators voting is usually required for final passage but Senate leaders agreed the bailout will need 60 votes to be approved.
