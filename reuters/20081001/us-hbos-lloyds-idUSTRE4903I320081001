 LONDON  (Reuters) - Standard Life Investments, a top investor in Lloyds TSB ( LLOY.L ) and HBOS HBOS.L, supports the planned takeover of HBOS by Lloyds under the terms originally announced, a person close to the investment firm said. 

 The news pushed HBOS shares higher, narrowing the discount they trade at relative to Lloyds' offer, in a sign that investors believe SLI's support makes the deal more likely to succeed. By 9:47 a.m. EDT, HBOS shares were up 20 percent at 147 pence, making them the top riser in the FTSE 100 share index, and putting them at a 31 percent discount to Lloyds' offer price. Lloyds TSB shares were up 13.7 percent at 257 pence, giving its bid a value of 213.3 pence. Under the agreed deal, HBOS investors get 0.83 Lloyds shares for every HBOS share they hold. On Tuesday, the discount rose as high as 35 percent as HBOS shares slumped on talk shareholders could reject the takeover, or that Lloyds could try to reduce its bid. A second investor in both HBOS and Lloyds on Wednesday also expressed support for the agreement as it stands. "I think the key thing is to get the deal done. I won't particularly argue for repricing," the investor told Reuters. POLITICAL PRESSURE In a note to clients, Credit Suisse analyst Jonathan Pierce said Lloyds and HBOS had several large shareholders in common who were likely to back the deal, boosting its chances of success. "Will the deal go ahead? We think the answer is probably yes. Not only is there considerable regulatory and political pressure to get this deal done, but there are considerable cross shareholdings between the banks," he wrote in a note. Twenty-five percent of Lloyds' 20 biggest shareholders have equally big holdings in Lloyds TSB, Pierce said. The Lloyds-HBOS tie-up, announced on Sept 18, was facilitated by the UK government, which exempted the deal from competition rules after a steep slump in HBOS' share price stirred fears the bank might fall victim to the credit crunch. Earlier on Wednesday, a spokesman for UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown said the government was in contact with both Lloyds and HBOS, while on Tuesday, Brown said he was confident the deal would go ahead. "I'm confident from talking to people involved that this merger is going ahead," Brown said in a interview with Sky News. Another analyst said Lloyds would be reluctant to abandon the HBOS takeover, as to do so could undermine its chances of completing subsequent acquisitions. "Whatever you think about the deal, Lloyds TSB has strategic ambitions, and if it were to back away from this it'd be hard to see how it would have credibility for another one," said Derek Chambers, an analyst at Standard & Poor's Equity Research. Standard Life holds about 3 percent of HBOS shares and about 1.5 percent of Lloyds, making it the fourth biggest HBOS investor and eighth biggest in Lloyds, according to Thomson Reuters data. Credit Suisse's Pierce added that the discount between HBOS shares and the Lloyds offer price exaggerated the true risk of the deal failing because of HBOS' vulnerability if it were to remain independent. "The potential downside in HBOS shares in the event the transaction doesn't proceed might be very significant. And so a relatively small risk of failure translates to a large discount," he wrote.
