 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The most serious financial crisis in decades has caused business executives around the world to rein in their expectations for short- and long-term growth and warn investors that business volatility will be around for some time to come. 

 In a series of interviews with Reuters reporters, these executives -- from industries as varied as software, chemicals and leisure -- spoke of the widening global credit crisis and their many concerns. Most said they were keeping a close eye on Washington, to see if U.S. lawmakers pass a $700 billion bailout package designed to halt the crisis. The following are excerpts and highlights from interviews with executives in the past week: MICROSOFT CORP ( MSFT.O ) CEO STEVE BALLMER: Ballmer said the global crisis will sap consumer and business spending, affecting all companies, including his own. "Financial issues are going to affect both business spending and consumer spending, and particularly ... spending by the financial services industry," Ballmer told reporters at a news conference in Oslo. "We have a lot of business with the corporate sector as well as with the consumer sector, and whatever happens economically will certainly effect itself on Microsoft," he told Reuters. "I think one has to anticipate that no company is immune to these issues," he said, but declined to be more specific. Ballmer said he believed the U.S. Congress would soon help stabilize the situation. "I trust that before the end of the week we have some resolution, at least in the U.S. Congress, that will help to stabilize the situation. We need that. I hope we get that," he said. INTEL CORP ( INTC.O ) CHAIRMAN CRAIG BARRETT: Intel will continue to invest in products and technologies even though it sees that a U.S. financial meltdown is likely to affect the emerging markets that are crucial for its growth, Barrett said. "I think you'd have to be prudent and assume that if the financial marketplace melts down there's going to be some impact. But nobody's predicting that, nobody knows how big it's going to be," he said. "The only thing we can do is look at that part of our future destiny that we can control, and that's our investment in the future, in the products we create and the technologies we create," he said. "We've always had the attitude that you have to make that investment in good times and bad," he said. "It's R&D, capital, marketing-intensive, and we're just like a blind greyhound, we just continue to race down the track." Of its 2007 revenue of $38.3 billion, the world's biggest chipmaker spent $5.8 billion on research and development and $5 billion on capital items such as property, plants and equipment. "You can't save your way out of a recession, you have to invest your way out, and so we've always kept a rainy day plan to accommodate that," Barrett said, adding that Intel had a financial cash cushion of $10 billion for that purpose. NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORP ( NOC.N ) CEO RON SUGAR: Northrop is "about as isolated as you can be" from the turmoil in U.S. and global financial markets, Sugar told Reuters. He said Northrop had dramatically improved its balance sheet over the past five to six years after being highly leveraged following several large acquisitions. It also had committed credit facilities, did not borrow much money, had good cash flow due to its heavy reliance on government orders, and had secure orders through multiyear contracts. "Nobody is totally immune from the craziness, (but) our industry and our company are about as isolated as you can be," Sugar said. "I don't want to sound like a Pollyanna, but ... we're not in the same place as many other financial and commercial institutions." DOW CHEMICAL ( DOW.N ) CEO ANDREW LIVERIS: The U.S. economy could go into a deep slump lasting as much as two years if lawmakers do not rush through a bailout package to thaw the credit markets, Liveris warned. "I'm in favor of a fix. And frankly, I'm in favor of a fix that works now," he said. "Unless there is a fix here in the next little while, I don't think we'll (see a light at the end of the tunnel). We're talking about a deep correction that could take 18 to 24 months," he said. Liveris said he has never experienced a financial crisis as serious as this during his 32-year career with Dow. "There's nothing that parallels what's going on right now ... And I haven't found anyone who's lived through this sort of financial crisis," he said. BULGARI BULG.MI CEO FRANCESCO TRAPANI: The Italian jeweler's chief said the financial crisis was impacting trading and forecast Christmas sales would be poorer this year. Bulgari, the world's No. 3 jewelry maker behind Tiffany ( TIF.N ) and Cartier, part of Geneva-based Richemont ( CFR.VX ), does not expect any major improvement before 2010. "The environment is particularly difficult because of the U.S. financial crisis... and I expect that September, October and Christmas will be more difficult," he said. "We will not see any major improvement before 2010; I think the world will need another year before we see light at the end of the tunnel." YOIGO CEO JOHAN ANDSJO: Spanish mobile operator Yoigo, controlled by Sweden's TeliaSonera ( TLSN.ST ), said it was on target to reach 1 million customers by the end of the year. Andsjo told Reuters the operator's number of clients continues to rise and it is on track to hold a 2 percent share of the market by end-2008. "In September, sales are growing day by day," Andsjo said. "Compared to our campaign in July, sales are up by 20 percent." He said the company's strategy of low mobile prices could help it attract more customers as Spaniards look to tighten their belts in the face of a sharp economic downturn. LAS VEGAS SANDS ( LVS.N ) MAJORITY OWNER SHELDON ADELSON: Adelson said his family has invested $475 million in the casino operator so it could pay down debt and maintain leverage ratios. But the company is still seeking financing for its Macau projects. "Had the availability of money been more plentiful, we would have gone out and borrowed," said Adelson, who is also the company's chairman and chief executive. "This way, I am minimizing the dilution to shareholders."
