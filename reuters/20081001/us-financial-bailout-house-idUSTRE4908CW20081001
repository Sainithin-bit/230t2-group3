 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The House of Representatives likely will consider the $700 billion financial industry bailout on Friday if the package gets bipartisan majority support in the Senate, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said on Wednesday. 

 "Members of the House leadership on both sides of the aisle are talking to our colleagues, and if there is bipartisan, majority support for the Senate package we will likely bring it to the Floor on Friday," Hoyer, of Maryland, said in a statement. The Senate is to vote on the package on Wednesday evening. (Reporting by  Vicki Allen , Editing by Sandra Maler)
