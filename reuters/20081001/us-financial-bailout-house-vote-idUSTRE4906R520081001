 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The House of Representatives is "likely" to vote on Friday on a new version of a $700 billion Wall Street bailout bill, a senior House Democratic aide said on Wednesday. 

 The Senate is hoping to pass the bill late on Wednesday and then send it to the House for a vote. (Reporting by  Richard Cowan , Editing by Sandra Maler)
