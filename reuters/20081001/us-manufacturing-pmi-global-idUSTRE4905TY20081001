 LONDON  (Reuters) - Global manufacturing activity contracted for the fourth consecutive month in September, falling to its weakest in almost seven years, a survey showed on Wednesday. 

 The JP Morgan Global Manufacturing PMI, compiled with research and supply management organizations, fell to 44.2 in September, its lowest since November 2001, from 48.6 in August. That was the fourth month in a row the index was below the 50.0 mark dividing growth from contraction. "The deepening of the downturn in global manufacturing during September was greater than anticipated. The widespread nature of the contraction ... further reinforces the far reaching effects of the turmoil manufacturers are facing," said David Hensley, a director at JP Morgan. Data released earlier on Wednesday showed manufacturing activity in the UK shrank at the fastest rate since records began almost 17 years ago, while activity in both the euro zone and the United States fell to levels not seen since the 2001 September terror attacks in the U.S. One bright spot in the report showed input price inflation fell to a 19-month low of 61.1 in September from 73.0 in August -- its greatest month-on-month decline in the ten-year series history. The index combines data from countries including the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, China and Russia. (Reporting by  Jonathan Cable ; Editing by Ron Askew)
