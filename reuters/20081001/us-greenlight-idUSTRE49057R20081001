 (Reuters) - David Einhorn-controlled Greenlight Capital Re Ltd ( GLRE.O ) forecast a third-quarter loss, hurt by negative returns on its investment portfolio, sending shares down as much as 30 percent to an all-time low. 

 "While our underwriting portfolio continues to perform well, this has been an extraordinarily difficult investment period," Einhorn, chairman of the company said. Greenlight Re's investment portfolio is managed by DME Advisors, a company controlled by Einhorn. The Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands-based reinsurer said it expects a third-quarter loss of between $3.30 and $3.45 per share. Two analysts expect the company to report earnings of 77 cents a share, excluding special items, according to Reuters Estimates. Greenlight Re, said investment return for the quarter was negative 15.9 percent. For the month of September, the investment return was negative 11.5 percent, the company said. The company said it does not have any material exposure to securities issued by American International Group, Fannie Mae, Freddy Mac, Lehman Brothers Holdings, Wachovia Corp or Washington Mutual. Greenlight Re had raised almost $200 million in a listing on Nasdaq in May 2007. At the time of its offering the company said it employs a higher-risk -- and potentially more lucrative -- investment strategy than most other reinsurers. Shares of the company fell $6.74 to $16.25 in early trade on the Nasdaq. They earlier touched a low of $15.00. (Reporting by Amiteshwar Singh in Bangalore, Editing by Dinesh Nair)
