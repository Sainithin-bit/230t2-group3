 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives is likely to vote by midday Friday on a $700 billion Wall Street bailout bill that is expected to be approved by the Senate on Wednesday, House Democratic leader Steny Hoyer told reporters on Wednesday. 

 While Hoyer said there had been discussions about holding the vote on Thursday, he added, "My plan is to vote ... late morning or early afternoon" on Friday. (Reporting by  Richard Cowan  and  Donna Smith , Editing by Sandra Maler)
