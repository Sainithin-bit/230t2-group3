 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The White House on Wednesday said the U.S. financial industry would recover and rebuild in the aftermath of the current crisis. 

 "I think we will be able to recover, and they will return with the great talent that still exists there, and still a great deal of expertise, and we will be able to rebuild from what we have had," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said. Asked whether foreign investors should invest in the United States, Fratto replied: "Investors should make their own decisions." (Reporting by  Tabassum Zakaria ; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
