 PARIS  (Reuters) - French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde denied on Wednesday that France was planning a 300 billion euro ($424.4 billion) EU bank rescue package. 

 Earlier on Wednesday, a European Union government source told Reuters that France was planning to propose an EU rescue package for banks worth 300 billion euros. Asked about the report, Lagarde told reporters: "There is no such thing. There is nothing of the sort." She also called for international cooperation in working on a reaction to the financial markets crisis. "I think we all need to close ranks together and work out the best proposal that will be workable, efficient, feasible for the financial sector and for the financial crisis to be addressed properly on a global basis. But don't quote me on any numbers because I don't have any numbers available," she added. (Reporting by  Crispian Balmer ; writing by Francois Murphy)
