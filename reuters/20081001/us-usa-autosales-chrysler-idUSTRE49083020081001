 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Chrysler LLC said on Wednesday its U.S. sales fell 33 percent in September to 107,349 vehicles because of a highly volatile economic environment and reduced fleet and lease volume. 

 "The economy is going through a difficult restructuring, resulting in great uncertainty among consumers," Jim Press, Chrysler Vice Chairman and President, said in a statement. Chrysler's car sales declined 29 percent, while its truck sales declined 34 percent. Chrysler also announced a new consumer incentive program, featuring cash rebates and low-cost loans, on 2008 model-year vehicles. Chrysler's numbers were not adjusted for the extra selling day in September 2007. (Reporting by  Poornima Gupta ; Editing by  Andre Grenon )
