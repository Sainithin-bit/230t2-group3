 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. factory activity contracted for a second month in September, while inflation pressures tumbled and employment in the sector fell, according to an industry report released on Wednesday. 

 The Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity fell to 43.5 in September from 49.9 in August. The level of 50 separates contraction from expansion. Economists had expected a reading of 49.5, according to the median of their forecasts in a Reuters poll. The 81 forecasts ranged from 47.0 to 51.1.
