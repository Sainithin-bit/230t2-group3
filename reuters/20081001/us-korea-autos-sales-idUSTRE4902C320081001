 SEOUL  (Reuters) - Combined sales of South Korea's 

 automakers dipped 0.7 percent from a year ago, data from companies showed on Wednesday, hit by partial strikes at Hyundai Motor Co and weaker domestic demand amid credit crisis worries. Hyundai and the country's four other auto companies sold 387,272 vehicles in September, compared to 389,834 a year earlier and up 5.8 percent from 365,874 in August. Local sales fell 14.7 percent to 77,635 vehicles in September from 90,957 a year ago, while overseas sales rose 3.6 percent to 309,637 vehicles in September from 298,877 a year earlier. Auto exports, which account for 10 percent of all South Korean exports, fell an estimated 18.4 percent in value from a year ago, data from the Ministry of Knowledge Economy showed earlier. Sales of Hyundai edged up 0.6 percent from a year ago, but its local sales dropped 35.3 percent as unionized workers at the country's top carmaker staged partial strikes for four times in September costing the company 15,926 units in lost output. Shares in Hyundai ended up 0.14 percent at 73,600 won with its affiliate Kia falling 2.39 percent to 14,300 won, compared with a 0.58 percent loss in the wider market. Ssangyong Motor Co declined 1.39 percent to 2,485 won.
