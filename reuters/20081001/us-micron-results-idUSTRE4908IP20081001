 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Micron Technology Inc MU.N said on Wednesday its quarterly loss doubled and was worse than expected, as sales slowed and prices fell in the face of a memory chip supply glut. 

 The company said it planned to slash capital spending on new production capacity by 55 to 66 percent to between $1 billion and $1.3 billion in fiscal 2009. For fiscal 2008 ending in August, Micron had spent $2.9 billion on capex, also sharply down from $4.1 billion in 2007. To further reduce costs, Micron said it has cut the salaries of its senior executive team by 20 percent. "The global memory market continues to experience severe oversupply and price degradation, and it remains a challenging period for all of us competing in the industry," Chairman and Chief Executive Steve Appleton said in a statement. "It looks like it is going to be a softer holiday than initially hoped," a Micron executive later told investors on a conference call held to discuss its fourth-quarter results. He said demand among major product makers and retailers for so-called flash memory chips used in digital cameras and mobile phones is weakening heading into the year-end holidays -- the biggest selling season of the year for its products. Company officials said they were hopeful that slower production growth industrywide will help improve pricing and profitability beginning in 2009. Shares of Micron gained 6 percent, or 25 cents, to end at $4.30 on the New York Stock Exchange. Following the results, which came after the close of regular trading, the stock fell back 3 percent, or 12 cents, to $4.18. Micron shares have dropped more than 40 percent so far this year. Another Micron executive said demand is mixed for computer memory chips, which make up the biggest segment of its business. "While PC desktop systems have shown some signs of weakening demand going into the holidays, the notebook segment continues to be strong," said Mark Adams, Micron's vice president of sales, said on the conference call. For the fourth quarter ended August 28, Micron said it took charges of $4 million for employee severance and $33 million for related costs and to write down facilities and relocation and retention bonuses. During fiscal 2008, Micron incurred restructuring costs of $52 million. The Boise, Idaho company reduced its work force by 3 percent to 23,509 employees, with heavier cuts of 15 percent in corporate functions such as sales and administration. Micron's fourth-quarter net loss of $344 million, or 45 cents per diluted share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $158 million, or 21 cents per diluted share. The latest results included a noncash write-down of $205 million, or 27 cents a share, and a gain of $70 million, or 9 cents a share, for price adjustments on flash memory products from other suppliers. Excluding one-time items, Micron reported a loss of $209 million, or 27 cents per diluted share. Net sales inched up 0.8 percent to $1.45 billion. Analysts had expected an adjusted loss, on average, of 23 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Wall Street had expected net sales, on average of $1.54 billion. Forecasts ranged from $1.40 billion to $1.75 billion. Profitability fell as sales of computer memory chips known as DRAM decreased while average selling prices of flash memory typically used in consumer electronics fell faster than Micron's ability to reduce costs. Only Micron's smaller image sensor business enjoyed higher sales, it said. Micron estimated sufficient cash flow from operations to cover its projected capital spending plans in 2009. The company generated $243 million in cash flow during the fourth quarter and $1 billion during 2008, it said. Micron said it has $1.4 billion in cash and investments, insulating it from the growing corporate credit crunch. (Editing by  Tim Dobbyn ,  Bernard Orr ,  Richard Chang )
