 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp said on Wednesday that U.S. light vehicle sales fell 16 percent in September to 282,806 units, pressured by the sharp downturn in demand for light trucks. 

 Overall, GM sales of light trucks fell 19.3 percent in August, while sales of cars fell 9.8 percent. GM estimated its share of the U.S. market in September at 27 percent. During September, the automaker offered most of its vehicles at prices its employees pay in an effort to boost sales. GM said it had 717,000 vehicles in inventory at the end of September, down about 179,000 vehicles compared with the same month last year. The inventory included about 275,000 cars and 442,000 trucks. The automaker reiterated that it plans to produce 875,000 vehicles in the fourth quarter, down about 16 percent compared with a year ago. (Reporting by  Poornima Gupta , editing by Richard Chang)
