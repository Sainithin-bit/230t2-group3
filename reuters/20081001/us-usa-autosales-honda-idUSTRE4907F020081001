 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co Ltd said on Wednesday that U.S. auto sales declined 21 percent to 96,626 units in September. 

 "This September was an incredibly volatile month for Wall Street," said Dick Colliver, executive vice president of sales for American Honda, in a statement. "Obviously, no one is immune to market shifts as dramatic as we have been seeing." Honda division sales fell 20 percent while Acura sales declined 28 percent last month.
