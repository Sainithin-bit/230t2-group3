 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - US Bancorp ( USB.N ) on Wednesday posted a stronger-than-expected third-quarter profit, helped by higher revenues from its fee-based businesses and lower credit losses. 

 Minneapolis-based US Bancorp said profit climbed more than 50 percent to $908 million, or 45 cents a share, from $603 million, or 30 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts on average expected earnings of 43 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "We have reached the inflection point in credit quality," Chief Executive Richard Davis said in a statement. But he added, "We are mindful of the need to continue to protect our fortress balance sheet." Even as credit losses slowed, the company added more to its cushion against future losses. Davis said that while total loans were down slightly from a year earlier, the bank's loan book grew from the second quarter and in particular there was a pick-up in commercial loans in the third quarter. That signals that U.S. companies are starting to borrow more. The bank said it was the first quarterly increase in commercial loans since the fourth quarter of 2008. US Bancorp has large fee-based businesses such as debit and credit card payment processing and these powered third-quarter revenue. The bank's revenue rose almost 8 percent to $4.6 billion in the quarter. (Reporting by Elinor Comlay; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn and Steve Orlofsky)
