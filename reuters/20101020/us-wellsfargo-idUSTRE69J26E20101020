 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co ( WFC.N ) reported on Wednesday that third-quarter profit rose, as lower loan losses helped counter a drop in revenue. 

 The company, the fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets, reported that earnings increased to $3.34 billion from $3.24 billion a year earlier. Earnings per share rose to 60 cents from 56 cents in the year-earlier period. San Francisco-based Wells Fargo said revenue fell 7 percent to $20.9 billion. Wells Fargo shares rose 1 percent in pre-market trade to at $24.82. (Reporting by  Elinor Comlay ; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)
