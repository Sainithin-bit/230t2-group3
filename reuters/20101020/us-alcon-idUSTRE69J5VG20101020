 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Eye care products maker Alcon Inc ACL.N, which Swiss drugmaker Novartis ( NOVN.VX ) is buying, reported a 13 percent drop in quarterly profit as merger costs offset sales growth in product areas such as implanted lenses and glaucoma drugs. 

 Alcon posted a third-quarter net profit of $446 million, or $1.47 a share, down from $515 million, or $1.71 a share, a year earlier. Excluding the change of control costs, the company earned $1.84 a share, which beat the average analyst estimate of $1.75 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Quarterly sales rose 9 percent to $1.76 billion. The company raised its 2010 earnings forecast to $7.58 to $7.68 a share, from a previous range of $7.45 to $7.62 a share, and said it still expects organic sales growth in the high single digits. For the third quarter, sales rose 13.5 percent for intraocular lenses, and 10.5 percent for glaucoma pharmaceutics. Profit margins widened to 76 percent from 75.3 percent in the 2009 third quarter. The planned Novartis acquisition has been contentious because the drugmaker's offer to Alcon's minority shareholders is substantially below what it agreed to pay Swiss conglomerate Nestle ( NESN.VX ) for its majority stake in the eye care company. Basel-based Novartis wrapped up its $38.7 billion purchase of Nestle's 77 percent stake this summer and a recent rise in its share price means that its stock offer for the remaining 23 percent is now looking more attractive. Shares of Alcon, which closed at $168.76 on the New York Stock Exchange, held steady in after-hours trading. (Reporting by Deena Beasley; Editing by  Robert MacMillan  and  Richard Chang )
