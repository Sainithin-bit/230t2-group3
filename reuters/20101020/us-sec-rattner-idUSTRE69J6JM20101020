 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is to vote on Thursday on a settlement with Steven Rattner, the former head of the U.S. auto task force, over his role in a pay-to-play scheme, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing a person familiar with the matter. 

 An SEC representative declined to comment. Five SEC commissioners are expected to vote on a potential $6 million deal that would bar Rattner from the securities industry for two years. A vote had been scheduled for last Thursday but was pulled from the calendar, a source told Reuters last week. New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo is probing Rattner's role in a kickback scheme when Rattner was still at private equity firm Quadrangle Group LLC. Cuomo's office declined to comment.
