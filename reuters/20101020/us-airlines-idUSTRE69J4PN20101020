 ATLANTA/WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Major U.S. airlines accelerated their recovery in the summer travel season and reported strong profits on impressive revenues on Wednesday, sending the sector's shares soaring on optimism for the remainder of the year. 

 Delta Air Lines Inc ( DAL.N ) and US Airways Group Inc ( LCC.N ) beat Wall Street forecasts and American Airlines parent AMR Corp AMR.N delivered its first profit since the third quarter of 2007, excluding items. "The industry has continued to rebound as business travel has continued to improve over the past year," said Matthew Jacob, an analyst with Majestic Research. "Many of the airlines have done a good job of streamlining their costs and improving their margins." US Airways' $240 million profit was a record for the airline in the July-to-September period, traditionally the industry's busiest. Airlines responded to higher fuel prices in the quarter with fare increases that helped them post double-digit revenue gains, despite a sluggish U.S. economy. Delta shares shot up nearly 11 percent. AMR rose 10 percent and US Airways was up 8.7 percent. The shares of United Continental Holdings Inc ( UAL.N ), the new industry leader, gained 7.2 percent. Southwest Airlines Co ( LUV.N ) rose 4 percent. United Continental, formed in the merger of United parent UAL Corp and Continental, will report its results along with Southwest on Thursday. The outlook for the sector is positive amid rebounding travel demand and tight capacity, which allows carriers to charge more for tickets. Analysts expect airlines overall to further cement their turnaround, although fuel prices and an uncertain U.S. economy could soften bottom lines. Gains associated with increased international travel could weaken somewhat because of costlier fuel. "We think improved profitability will drive expanded valuations for (Delta) and other U.S. legacy airlines," said Standard & Poor's analyst Jim Corridore. The air traffic recovery is also giving a boost to plane manufacturers such as Boeing Co ( BA.N ), which also topped Wall Street profit views on Wednesday. OVERSEAS FLYING, BAG FEES American and Delta benefited from strong international results. Most carriers also tapped a geyser of revenue from bag fees and other ancillary passenger charges in recording profits for the second straight quarter. Airlines do not break out luggage fees separately, but a sampling of data collected by the government shows carriers made about $275 million in bag fees in September alone. Delta, the No. 2 airline, said demand should continue into the holiday season and added its global network is generating revenue gains that should help produce its first profitable fourth quarter in a decade. Since buying Northwest Airlines in 2008, Delta has focused on cutting debt, boosting passenger amenities and expanding service to higher-growth markets. Delta commentary suggested "there's some more upside to be seen in the fourth quarter," Jacob said. Atlanta-based Delta had net income of $363 million, or 43 cents a share, for the third quarter, compared with a year-earlier net loss of $161 million, or 19 cents a share. Excluding items, Delta earned $1.10 a share, above the 94 cents expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total passenger revenue was up 19 percent at $7.7 billion, while fuel costs were up 3 percent. Excluding special items, US Airways' third-quarter profit was $1.23 per share, beating Wall Street's forecast by 6 cents. The carrier's revenue rose 16.9 percent and CEO Doug Parker promised in a statement to continue aggressive cost management. Business travel on US Airways was up 23 percent, making up for less robust revenue from leisure customers. Fuel costs rose 15 percent. US Airways did not give profit guidance for the fourth quarter, but forecast significant year-over-year revenue growth. Parker, a proponent of consolidation, does not envision near-term merger prospects for the airline. But told analysts in a conference call there was "a lot of room" for investors to benefit without additional industry consolidation. Although American's labor costs are high and fuel costs were up 11 percent, the No. 3 U.S. airline by traffic posted a quarterly profit of $143 million, or 39 cents per share. Wall Street had expected earnings of 32 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. American's revenue was up 14 percent at $5.8 billion, which was in line with expectations. American said it would increase daily departures from Los Angeles by 28 percent to 153 flights a day. It is planning new routes to Asia, including service to Shanghai, and nine new domestic markets in spring 2011. Questions persist about American's strategic direction. American had fallen behind rivals in traffic and has trailed major rivals, which have been making money now for the past six months. Industry experts say American needs a partner, although the airline has long maintained it does not need a merger mate to compete, saying it can offer corporate clients access to markets that are important to them. For instance, American and Japan Airlines Corp JALFQ.PK received U.S. government approval earlier this month for closer cooperation on transpacific routes. Earlier this year, American won clearance for a similar deal with British Airways Plc BAY.L over the Atlantic. (Editing by Gerald E. McCormick, Lisa Von Ahn and  Andre Grenon )
