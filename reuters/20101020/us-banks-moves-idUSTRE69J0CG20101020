 HONG KONG/SHANGHAI  (Reuters) - Hong Kong-listed shares of major Chinese banks fell on Wednesday after a surprise interest rate increase unsettled investors and raised questions about the central bank's next move to cool the Chinese economy. 

 Market reaction was swift, with the world's biggest lender by market value Industrial and Commercial Bank of China ( 1398.HK ) falling 1.7 percent, Bank of Communications ( 3328.HK ) down 1.9 percent, Bank of China ( 3988.HK ) off 2.2 percent, and recently listed Agricultural Bank of China ( 1288.HK ) easing 0.7 percent. China's central bank jolted global markets late Tuesday evening with a 25-basis-point hike in one-year deposit and lending rates, a move that could mark the start of a more aggressive phase of monetary tightening. "We think the market should see the rate hike as a speed bump on the road, as it also reflects the government's confidence in the strength of economic activity," said UBS economist Tao Wang. Chinese banks have underperformed the benchmark Hong Kong share index  .HSI  this year on concerns that a heavy lending over the past two years could have deteriorated the asset quality. A spate of capital raisings this year also contributed to the underperformance. By 0235 GMT, the banking sub-index  .HSNF  was down 1.3 percent, while the benchmark index was off 1.6 percent. Despite the initial reaction, analysts said the interest rate rise will boost lenders' net interest margin, though uncertainty about future moves could offset any benefits it could have on earnings. "We estimate the current interest rate change will positively impact 2011 earnings by 2-3 percent, though future asymmetric rate adjustments remain likely in our view. As a result, we are not changing our 2011 EPS estimates," Mike Werner, senior analyst with Sanford Bernstein said. In asymmetric rate adjustment, deposit rates rise faster than lending rates. Werner mentioned CCB, China Merchant Bank Co Ltd ( 3968.HK ) and ICBC as his preferred picks saying the three lenders had good exposure to fast growing fee-based income and generate the highest level of deposit from demand deposits.
