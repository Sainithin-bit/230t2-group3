 BOSTON/NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Three major U.S. industrial companies raised their profit forecasts for the rest of the year on Wednesday, saying they were finding pockets of growth in the still-uncertain U.S. economy. 

 But shares of Textron Inc ( TXT.N ) fell as much as 4.8 percent as investors worried about the long slump in demand for corporate jets. Sales were down 35 percent at its Cessna unit, with businesses still skittish about making purchases after private aircraft became a symbol of corporate excess during the recent brutal recession. Meanwhile, shares of United Technologies Corp ( UTX.N ), which makes engines and electronic components for large jets, rose. The company saw a surge in service activity as major airlines, which cut their maintenance budgets last year, needed to bring more planes in for major overhauls as business and leisure travelers return to the air. Both companies, as well as Eaton Corp ( ETN.N ), a maker of electric and hydraulic controls, posted revenue that topped Wall Street's expectations -- an important indicator of the sustainability of their growth following a year of heavy cost cutting. Investors were still uncertain how soon Cessna demand at Providence, Rhode Island-based Textron would turn the corner. "Bottom line, the Cessna market has to turn around," said Perry Adams, vice president at Huntington Private Financial Group in Traverse City, Michigan, who holds Textron shares in the portfolios he manages. "You can only do so much through cost saves." Textron Chief Executive Scott Donnelly has laid off about a quarter of the company's staff since the recession began, most recently kicking off a round of 700 job cuts at Cessna due to the uncertain direction of the jet market. The company reported a net loss for the quarter after taking heavy charges related to its cutback of its finance arm. Operating profit met Wall Street's expectations, helped by strong demand for Bell helicopters and industrial equipment. "We think our results again demonstrate the earnings power of the company, despite the continued weakness in the business jet market," Donnelly told investors on a conference call. He added that he expects Cessna to return to profitability in the fourth quarter. MAINTENANCE BOOSTS UNITED TECH Hartford, Connecticut-based United Tech, meanwhile, was boosted by a resurgence of commercial airline activity. As businesses and vacationers cut back on travel last year, major airlines parked many idle aircraft. That move allowed them to save money on maintenance by cannibalizing parts from the unused planes when they needed to maintain the ones that were flying. Delta Air Lines ( DAL.N ) and US Airways Group ( LCC.N ) posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue on Wednesday. Now, with more passengers taking to the wing, those airlines need to replenish their supplies of spare parts. United Tech expects its Pratt & Whitney jet engine unit to benefit more from this trend than its Hamilton Sundstrand aircraft electronics arm, executives said. "As those planes come out of the desert and the heavy maintenance comes back to us, I think you're going to see more of a pop at Pratt than Hamilton," said Greg Hayes, United Tech's chief financial officer. United Technologies, a component of the widely watched Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI , notched 13 percent profit growth and raised its full-year earnings target to the top end of its forecast range. That marked the third time this year it increased its outlook.

"Commercial construction markets remain weak except for emerging markets," Hayes said. "Given the unevenness of the global economic recovery, we're going to continue to aggressively take out structural costs." EMERGING MARKETS KEY Eaton, which makes hydraulics, electrical control systems and truck transmissions, posted results that topped Wall Street forecasts and raised its outlook for the rest of the year. It said that emerging market demand had offset continued weakness at home. The rebound in aircraft maintenance should also boost Eaton's results next year, an executive said. "We're seeing aftermarket increasing consistently, so we're pretty comfortable 2011 will be a bigger year than 2010," Eaton CEO Sandy Cutler said in an interview. Eaton shares were up 3.6 percent at $86.43 on Wednesday afternoon amid a broad rally in U.S. stocks. Textron was down about 2 percent at $20.54, off an earlier low at $19.93, while United Tech shares were up 0.8 percent at $74.17. Investors will get a broader look into the health of the industrial sector later this week, when companies including Caterpillar Inc ( CAT.N ) and Honeywell International Inc ( HON.N ) report on their third-quarter performance. Terex Corp ( TEX.N ) reports later on Wednesday. (Reporting by Scott Malone; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn and  Matthew Lewis )
