 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Textron Inc ( TXT.N ) reported quarterly results on Wednesday that met analysts' expectations and raised its forecast for the rest of the year, saying the restructuring of its finance arm is proceeding smoothly. 

 But large special charges related to the downsizing of its finance business pushed the diversified U.S. manufacturer to record a net loss in the quarter. The world's largest maker of business jets reported a net loss of $48 million or 17 cents per share, compared with net profit of $4 million, or 1 cent per share, a year earlier. The net loss included 30 cents per share of special charges related to the finance arm, which weighed on profits during the financial crisis. Factoring out one-time items, it recorded a profit of 8 cents per share, meeting analysts' expectations, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue came to $2.48 billion, down 2.7 percent, driven by a sharp decline in sales at small plane maker Cessna, which overshadowed growth at its Bell helicopter and industrial equipment arms. Textron raised its full-year profit target, saying it expects full-year earnings of 70 to 75 cents per share, up from its prior target of 55 to 65 cents. Demand for corporate jets fell sharply during the credit crunch and recession, hit by a double-whammy effect in which companies both looked for ways to cut their costs and shied away from any outlays that could be seen as excessively lavish. Honeywell International Inc ( HON.N ), which supplies cockpit electronics and other control systems for light planes, on Sunday said it does not expect deliveries of business jets to grow until 2012, a year later than it had previously forecast. Shares of Textron, which also makes EZ-Go golf carts, are up about 13 percent so far this year, trailing the 14 percent rise of the Standard & Poor's capital goods industry index. .GSPIC Textron's rivals include the Gulfstream unit of General Dynamics Corp ( GD.N ) and Canada's Bombardier Inc ( BBDb.TO ) in corporate jets, and United Technologies Corp ( UTX.N ) in helicopters.
