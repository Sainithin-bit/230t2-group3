 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Controversial projects in the huge U.S. economic stimulus package could be valuable bargaining chips in winning over skeptical Republicans -- getting rid of them could help the Democrats push it across the finish line. 

 With a price tag approaching $900 billion, Republicans blasted the package for including such programs as $335 million to prevent sexually transmitted diseases and $25 million to rehabilitate trails for all-terrain vehicles. Democrats "are going to use some of these things as bargaining chips," said Larry Sabato, a political science professor at the University of Virginia. "But the vast majority (of Republicans) will vote no on the final package." President Barack Obama and his fellow Democrats have already cut two provisions in the bill passed by the House of Representatives on Wednesday without a single Republican vote -- $200 million to fix up the National Mall and millions for family planning that Republicans said would fund contraceptives. "I think the president is trying to come up with something that would be palatable, but the members of Congress seem to be a few steps ahead of him," said Tom Schatz, president of the watchdog organization Citizens Against Government Waste. "They've got the votes, they know that he's not going to veto whatever they give him," he said, referring to Democratic leaders in the House and Senate. Schatz said many of the projects in the bill would modernize government facilities, but not create long-term, private-sector jobs. Republicans have been poring over the 647-page, $819 billion bill passed in the House and the $887 billion measure in the Senate to expose spending they say will do little to create jobs and spur economic growth. Instead they want more tax cuts. In addition to the National Mall projects, they have highlighted programs like $34 million to remodel the Commerce Department's headquarters and up to $150 million to help producers of livestock, honey bees and farm-raised fish. 'HUGE SPENDING PACKAGE' The stimulus was originally crafted to have about $275 billion in tax breaks and some $550 billion in spending. Obama's administration has indicated a willingness to make modifications to the package. "I hope that at some point the White House will exercise adult supervision here ... right now it's nothing but a huge spending package," said Senator Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican. The Democrats have a majority in the Senate, but Obama would like some Senate Republicans to vote for the plan as a way of expressing bipartisan unity on the need for the massive program, aimed at stopping the slide in the U.S. economy after 13 months of recession. Relenting on some of the extras could help Democrats get the overall program passed and keep the main structure of the legislation: spending on priorities like upgrades to transportation infrastructure and the aging energy grid as well as expanding broadband access. Republicans have tried to club Democrats with a report by Congressional Budget Office Director Douglas Elmendorf, who said direct payments to individuals and cutting federal taxes would have the fastest impact on the economy. In the past, there has been a "noticeable lag" between big funding increases and spending, Elmendorf said. This week, Republicans in the Senate will likely have an opportunity to try to strip out some of the provisions they object to and try to shift the emphasis to tax cuts. There are some prospects on getting more tax cuts. Senators John Ensign, a Nevada Republican, and Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat, are working on language to slash taxes on companies that bring back profits from overseas from the current 35 percent rate. "We have a good chance," Ensign said, noting that a similar tax break a few years ago won a large majority of support. However, Senator Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat, said he and his colleagues believed the tax package was near the top of what they would accept. "I think the level of tax cuts is about as high as it ought to go," he said. (Editing by  Patricia Zengerle  and  Mohammad Zargham )
