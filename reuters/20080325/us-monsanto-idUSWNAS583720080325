 KANSAS CITY, Missouri  (Reuters) - Agricultural biotech company Monsanto Co ( MON.N ) raised its second-quarter and fiscal 2008 earnings forecasts on Tuesday, citing strong demand for corn seed and glyphosate-based herbicides, sending its shares up 9 percent. 

 Monsanto and its peers have been reaping the benefits of a boom in the agricultural sector, fueled in part by rising demand for corn-based ethanol and the increased purchasing power of developing nations. Monsanto also received a recent boost worth about 23 cents a share from the settlement of claims in conjunction with the emergence from bankruptcy last month of Solutia Inc., a troubled Monsanto chemicals affiliate. St Louis-based Monsanto said it now expects full-year earnings from continuing operations of $3.15 to $3.25 a share, compared with a prior forecast of $2.70 to $2.80. It forecast net earnings of $3.38 to $3.48 a share. Monsanto rival DuPont Co ( DD.N ) also recently raised its first-quarter outlook due to strong demand for its agricultural products. Monsanto forecast fiscal second-quarter earnings from continuing operations of $1.75 a share, and net earnings of $1.98. The average Wall Street forecast is $1.36 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Monsanto said the combination of its strong seed and traits business, the performance of its Roundup and other glyphosate-based herbicides business, and the Solutia resolution translated to free cash flow of $1.4 billion for the fiscal year, up from prior guidance of $900 million to $1 billion. It said it expects net cash provided by operating activities of about $2.45 billion, and net cash required by investing activities of about $1.05 billion for fiscal 2008. Monsanto shares were up $9.44 to $113.70 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by  Carey Gillam ; editing by John Wallace)
