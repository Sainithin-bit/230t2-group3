 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Bank of Japan (BOJ) Deputy Governor Kiyohiko Nishimura said on Tuesday that investors' risk aversion continues amid fears of losses at financial institutions ensuing from the U.S. subprime loan woes and their impact on the real economy. 

 Nishimura also told the lower house of parliament's financial affairs committee that movements in stock prices could affect Japan's real economy in various ways. Nishimura was a policy board member at the central bank before being appointed a deputy governor last week. It was his first appearance before a parliamentary committee since then.
