 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Bank of China ( 3988.HK ), the country's flagship foreign exchange lender, posted a 31 percent rise in 2007 profit amid a booming mainland economy, but it booked a $1.3 billion allowance to cover potential losses on its U.S. subprime-related securities. 

 The state-run lender said it held about US$4.99 billion worth of subprime-related asset-backed securities (ABS) at the end of 2007. The Beijing-based bank ( 601988.SS ), in which Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ) is a large shareholder, posted 2007 net profit of 56.25 billion yuan ($7.98 billion), compared with 42.83 billion yuan in 2006. On average, 26 analysts were expecting a net profit of 53.46 billion yuan for last year, with an 8 billion yuan profit seen for the fourth quarter, according to Reuters Estimates. Bank of China's Hong Kong-listed shares had lost 20 percent so far this year through last week, compared with a 24 percent drop in the benchmark Hang Seng Index  .HSI , amid a rout in global equities sparked by fears of a U.S. recession and growing troubles in credit markets. The shares rose 7.28 percent on Tuesday before the results report, compared with a 6.43 percent gain in the broader index.
