 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Video rental chain Blockbuster Inc BBI.N said on Tuesday its board has adopted a non-binding shareholder vote on executive pay beginning in 2009. 

 The "say on pay" provision allows shareholders a voice in the compensation of top executives, including Blockbuster Chief Executive Jim Keyes and Chief Financial Officer Thomas Casey. (Reporting by  Michele Gershberg ; editing by John Wallace)
