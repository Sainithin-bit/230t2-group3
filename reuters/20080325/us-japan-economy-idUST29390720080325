 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Acting Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said on Tuesday downside risks for the economy were growing and the outlook was uncertain, underscoring concern that the world's second-largest economy may follow the United States into a recession. 

 Shirakawa, the BOJ's first temporary governor in more than 80 years, repeated the central bank's mantra that interest rates need to be raised from the current low 0.5 percent if the economy looks like staying on track for sustained growth. But he stressed the importance of looking at various risks threatening the short-term economic outlook such as jittery financial markets, a global economic slowdown and rising raw material costs that are hurting smaller firms' revenues. "The outlook for the economy is always uncertain, and uncertainty is particularly high now," Shirakawa told the lower house of parliament's financial affairs committee. "What I always tell myself is that we should not have any preconceptions and should act flexibly by examining risks and the feasibility of our economic forecast." Former BOJ Governor Toshihiko Fukui picked Shirakawa, approved by parliament as new deputy BOJ governor, to head the central bank until parliament can agree on a permanent successor to Fukui himself. Kiyohiko Nishimura, a BOJ board member promoted to deputy governor last week, told the committee that downside economic risks were heightening and that the BOJ would need to act flexibly if the risks materialize. The two, however, did not mention the possibility of a rate cut and reiterated that despite mounting risks, the Japanese economy was still expected to expand moderately as a trend. "Shirakawa, as a career central banker, stuck to the BOJ's stance of raising rates back to normal levels in the medium term," said Hirokata Kusaba, a senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute. "Still, it was confirmed that the BOJ will keep rates on hold over the coming year as neither Shirakawa nor Nishimura touched on the possibility of a rate cut despite growing uncertainties over the economy," he said. Financial markets did not react much to the pair's remarks as they did little to alter dominant market views that the BOJ would keep rates on hold, at least until a new governor is selected to fill a policy vacuum created by political wrangling. Investors have priced in around a 30 percent chance of a BOJ rate cut by June, and Goldman Sachs said a cut may come as early as Shirakawa's first rate review on April 8-9.  But other economists, noting Japanese rates are already at rock bottom, are not so sure the BOJ will cut its main policy rate. Analysts have called for a quick decision on a permanent head for the central bank amid mounting economic woes, but Japanese media say an appointment may not be made until early April. The failure to find a new permanent leader for the central bank in the world's No.2 economy has raised new doubts about the leadership of Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda, whose popularity was already sliding because of policy deadlocks in parliament. Japan's economy, driven by solid exports, grew 0.9 percent in the last three months of 2007, despite economists' expectations for much slower growth. But economists say deepening financial market problems could spell trouble for global economic growth, which Japan relies on heavily. Domestic consumption has been tepid as wages have been kept in check, while rising food and energy costs have hurt business and consumer sentiment. Although many economists expect Japan to narrowly avoid a recession, some say its economy is already in recession and the BOJ may have to cut interest rates later this year. Economists expect the BOJ's closely watched tankan survey due out on April 1 will show a broad slide in the business mood and lackluster capital spending plans.
