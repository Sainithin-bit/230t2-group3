 MUMBAI  (Reuters) - India's Tata Motors Ltd ( TAMO.BO )( TTM.N ) had closed a deal to buy Ford Motor Co's ( F.N ) Jaguar and Land Rover brands for $2.65 billion, news channel NDTV Profit said on Tuesday, citing unnamed sources. 

 The television channel said the deal would be signed in London later on Tuesday. However, a Tata Group spokesman said discussions were still going on and the company had no guidance to give on the deal. "We have nothing to tell you now," he said. Tata Motors, India's top vehicle maker, received union backing for the deal and was named the front-runner in January by Ford, which is seeking to shore up its balance sheet and reduce debt.
