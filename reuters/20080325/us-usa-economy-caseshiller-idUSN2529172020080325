 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Prices of existing U.S. single-family homes slumped in January, with 16 of the 20 regions measured posting record annual declines, according to the Standard & Poor's/Case Shiller national home price index reported on Tuesday. 

  KEY POINTS: * The composite month-over-month index of 20 metropolitan areas fell 2.4 percent to 180.65 in January from December, bringing the measure down 10.7 percent from a year earlier. * S&P said its composite month-over-month index of 10 metropolitan areas declined 2.3 percent in January to 196.06, for an 11.4 percent year-over-year drop.  COMMENTS:  JOSEPH LAVORGNA, SENIOR ECONOMIST, DEUTSCHE BANK, NEW YORK: "It's very weak. I think the breadth of the declines is important... No region was completely immune from the housing crisis, only Charlotte reported year-over-year gain, and half the regions reported double-digit declines. "It is pretty soft across the board and even in places that had been relatively immune to this point, like Portland and Seattle, they even posted declines. So the breadth is pretty large and pretty troubling, and while this is going to clear out inventories and long-term this is a positive, because this is what we needed to see happen, there will be negative near-term implications on consumer spending."  ANDREW RICHMAN, MANAGING DIRECTOR, SUNTRUST PERSONAL ASSET  MANAGEMENT DIVISION, WEST PALM BEACH, FLORIDA: "We knew home prices had to come down. The data shows they fell 10.7 percent in January (from January the year before)... a little steeper than expected. Inventories are still high and home prices have to come down."  PIERRE ELLIS, SENIOR ECONOMIST, DECISION ECONOMICS, NEW YORK: "Prices fell faster in January than they did in December and by more. Price declines are accelerating at the national level. But regional performances differed. Every region had a bigger decline than last time last month, but the degree of acceleration for each region was not the same. The regions that never saw the big boom are falling more slowly and may stabilize. The rate of decline in the New York slowed. Meanwhile, declines in the Los Angeles accelerated quite markedly. The outright decline was 16.5 percent in Los Angeles and the degree to which it worsened from last time was substantially greater. The New York region is almost 20 percent of the country's housing market and Los Angeles area is almost 15 percent. That's how they are weighted in the index which is supposed to give the proportional representation of the national stock."  MICHELLE MEYER, ECONOMIST, LEHMAN BROTHERS, NEW YORK "It shows that the housing correction is still underway. The weakness is not contained to the bubble areas. It has spread to the rest of the nation. Only one metro area Charlotte is showing home price increase but even that has slowed considerably. "We are starting to see mortgage rates come down slightly. But there is still quite a spread between that and the fed funds rate. The steps by the government has only targeted one part of the mortgage market. The non-agency part of the market is still quite stuck and borrowing cost is still quite high. These steps by the government on the GSEs will limit the downside but it's not going to fix the problem."  MARKET REACTION: * BONDS: U.S. Treasuries hold steady at higher levels * CURRENCIES: The dollar holds losses * STOCKS: U.S. equity index futures initially dip after data
