 LONDON  (Reuters) - India's Tata Motors Ltd ( TAMO.BO ) ( TTM.N ) will pay Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) quite a bit less for Jaguar and Land Rover than a media report of $2.65 billon, a source close to the deal said on Tuesday. 

 "That figure of $2.65 billion is highly unlikely," the source said. "You have to come south from that by quite a bit." Earlier, Indian news channel NDTV Profit said Tata Motors had signed a deal to buy the Jaguar and Land Rover brands for $2.65 billion. (Reporting by  Pete Harrison , writing by Dan Lalor)
