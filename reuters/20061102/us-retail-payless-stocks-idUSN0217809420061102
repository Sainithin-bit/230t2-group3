 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of shoe company Payless ShoeSource Inc. PSS.N rose as much as 7 percent on Wednesday after the retailer said third-quarter same-store sales rose 5.2 percent. 

 Payless, which mostly sells its own brands at its 4,574 stores, said total sales for the third-quarter rose to $703.4 million from $666.5 million a year ago, helped by strong footwear sales in its women's and children's categories. The Topeka, Kansas-based company also benefited from the higher prices it placed on the trendier items it has been selling for the last year, said Susquehanna Financial analyst Chris Svezia, who has a "neutral" rating on Payless stock. "There's been some change in the type of consumer they've been getting in the store, who's buying this type of product," Svezia said. "But at the same time, the overall units going out the door has declined ... Given the fact that Payless is more of a discounter, or mass merchandiser in terms of the product they sell, we would like to see unit growth, not just increases in the average selling prices." Payless stock, which trades at 17.79 times estimated earnings for 2006, is more than fairly priced compared to its peers, Svezia added. Based on its sales results, Payless said it expects third-quarter earnings to be 43 cents to 46 cents a share. Analysts, on average are expecting Payless to earn 41 cents a share for the third quarter, according to Reuters Estimates. The company said its estimate includes a tax benefit of 2 cents to 3 cents a share, as well as $2 million in exit costs resulting from its suspension of retail operations in Japan, where it had one test location. Payless, which is scheduled to release third-quarter results November 21, also said it will no longer be issuing a quarterly sales release. Shares of Payless rose 5.54 percent to $27.60 in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
