 PUTRAJAYA, Malaysia  (Reuters) - British aero-engine maker Rolls-Royce ( RR.L ) painted a rosy outlook for the sector on Thursday and said the company's turnover would not be affected by its suspension of work on engines for the Airbus 

  A380. Rolls-Royce said last month it had halted work on Trent 900 engines for the Airbus ( EAD.PA ) superjumbo for about 12 months because of Airbus's own delays in manufacturing the A380. "Our deliveries for the next two years are completely unaffected by the orders in the short term," Rolls-Royce Chief Executive John Rose told reporters in Malaysia's administrative capital. "What we are seeing is continued high level of activities in the airlines that will materialize in the deliveries a long time in the future." "For the most part, air freight companies are sold out for the next two years, so there will be a backlog in orders," he added at the launch of a tantalum processing and research and development facility in which Roll-Royce is a partner. Tantalum is a metal used to make strong, heat-tolerant alloys which are in turn used to make jet-engine parts. Rose said the Trent 900 made up a small part of Rolls-Royce's annual turnover, which includes production and support for engines for several models of planes from Airbus, Boeing ( BA.N ) and other manufacturers. Rolls-Royce also makes engines for military aircraft and ships and manufactures turbines for power producers. Asked if there would be any change in the firm's financial guidance for 2007, Rose said: "We have not given financial guidance for next year. We give guidance on an annual basis."
