 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. business productivity stalled unexpectedly in the third quarter, government data showed on Thursday, while unit labor costs rose at a pace that may vex the inflation-wary Federal Reserve. 

 Weekly jobless claims also increased by more than expected last week, while planned layoffs declined in October and September factory orders jumped on demand for aircraft. But the labor cost news dominated the financial markets, with U.S. Treasury note prices falling from fear of what the U.S. central bank might make of the implied wage pressures, after it warned the economy had little slack despite slowing growth. "The unit labor costs number is a bit unsettling for the Fed," said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James & Associates in St Petersburg, Florida. Fed officials worry rising labor costs may hinder a decline in inflation from levels which they have said are too high. "So many people have focused on commodity prices, but the Fed's real fear is always the labor market and the possibility of inflationary pressures developing there," he said. Interest rate futures slightly trimmed their implied chances for a Fed rate cut early next year. Forecasts for nonfarm business productivity had already been colored by a weak advance reading for U.S. economic output in the third quarter. Analysts had expected productivity to mount by 1.3 percent, versus a 1.2 percent gain in the second quarter. This was revised down from 1.6 percent rise previously reported. Compensation per hour grew 3.7 percent, almost half the pace in the second quarter, helping trim unit labor cost growth to 3.8 percent in the third quarter. 24-YEAR PEAK This was higher than the 3.4 percent gain forecast by Wall Street, but was an improvement on an upwardly revised 5.4 percent reading in the April to July period, in a series watched closely by the U.S. central bank. Unit labor costs are a gauge of inflation and profit pressures and they have grown 5.3 percent since the third quarter in 2005. That was the biggest gain on a quarter from the year-ago quarter since the fourth quarter of 1982, when the increase was 5.8 percent. "The Fed has said they like to see productivity keep pace with core PCE, so to have productivity come in unchanged is a big negative," said Marc Pado, U.S. market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald & Co, referring to the personal consumption expenditures price index favored by the Fed. "I think that is going to throw some real caution to the market," he said. The Fed in August halted a two-year campaign of lifting borrowing costs in gradual quarter percentage point steps and has since kept its overnight fed funds rate steady at 5.25 percent, while warning that risks of inflation remain. Also, its statement following the last policy meeting on October 24-25 specifically noted that "the high level of resource utilization has the potential to sustain inflation pressures." This is despite a slowdown in third quarter economic growth to an annualized 1.6 percent thanks to a collapse in housing investment, because policymakers expect the fourth quarter to show a rebound in activity. WAL-MART Some economists think weakness in the housing market has already spread and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) provided more ammunition for this view. The world's largest retailer on Thursday forecast flat November sales, in a pessimistic prognosis at the start of the vital holiday shopping season. Nonetheless, Fed policymakers think the U.S. is already operating near to, or even beneath, full employment -- the level at which further job growth will add to wage costs. Economists expect October's employment report, due out on Friday, to show unemployment remained steady at 4.6 percent, while 125,000 new jobs were created, compared with a mere 51,000 in September. Last week's jobless claims, also out on Thursday, were gathered too late to impact October's jobs report. The Labor Department said the number of U.S. workers applying for jobless benefits rose 18,000 to 327,000. This was the highest level of weekly claims since the July 8 week, when they were 334,000. Wall Street expected a 310,000 reading. The four-week moving average -- regarded as a more representative gauge of underlying employment trends -- rose to 311,250 from 305,500 the week before. Offering better news for the jobs outlook, planned U.S. layoffs fell 31 percent in October from the previous month, with the biggest cuts in the automotive and retail industries. Announced layoffs totaled 69,177 in October, down from 100,315 in September, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc., an employment consulting firm. In a separate release, Commerce Department data showed that new orders at U.S. factories rose 2.1 percent in September as strength in durable goods, particularly transportation, more than offset weakness in nondurable items.
