 LONDON  (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures pointed to a slightly stronger start on Wall Street on Thursday, with the focus on results but as economic growth concerns linger after a report showed manufacturing growth slowed to a near standstill. 

 Computer Sciences Corp ( CSC.N ), International Paper Co. ( IP.N ) and JDS Uniphase Corp JDSUD.O are among companies due to report results on Thursday. By 1055 GMT, Dow DJc1, S&P SPc1 and Nasdaq NDc1 futures were all up about 0.15 percent. Thursday sees the release of weekly U.S. jobless claims at 1330 GMT and factory orders for September at 1500 GMT, before the key non-farm payrolls report on Friday. Biomet BMET.O is also in focus after UK medical devices firm Smith & Nephew Plc ( SN.L ) said it had held "very preliminary talks" over a possible tie-up with the company, confirming a report in the Financial Times newspaper. On the results front, Electronic Data Systems Corp. EDS.N reported third-quarter net income of $125 million, or 24 cents a share, compared with $8 million, or 2 cents a share, a year earlier. EDS was expected to report earnings of 20 cents per share on revenue of $5.32 billion, according to the average forecasts of analysts polled by Reuters Estimates. U.S. blue chips fell for a fourth day on Wednesday and the Nasdaq slid more than 1 percent after a report showed manufacturing growth slowed to a near standstill, raising concerns the economy will not expand at a pace strong enough to support robust corporate profits. The Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity fell to 51.2 in October. A reading above 50 indicates growth. The ISM data followed a weaker-than-expected survey on Midwest business activity, released on Tuesday, and last Friday's lower-than-forecast growth in gross domestic product. On Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  fell 0.4 percent to end at 12,031.0 and the Nasdaq  .IXIC  slid 1.4 percent to 2,334.3.
