 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Costco Wholesale Corp. ( COST.O ) on Thursday said October sales rose 4 percent at its stores open at least a year, less than Wall Street had expected, hurt by falling prices for gasoline sold at its filling stations. 

 Analysts, on average, expected a 4.7 percent increase, according to estimates gathered by Reuters. Same-store sales rose just 2 percent at its U.S. stores, while the international business reported an 11 percent jump, with particular strength in Korea, Taiwan, Japan and Britain. Net sales rose 8 percent to $4.59 billion for the four weeks ended October 29, 2006. On a recorded message detailing its October sales performance, Costco said falling gasoline prices shaved 1.5 percentage points off of its same-store sales total. The average price per gallon of gasoline it sold in the October period was $2.25, well below last year's $2.63. Falling gasoline prices tend to hurt Costco's sales but boost profitability. The strongest categories included fresh food and "majors" such as televisions and kitchen appliances. (Additional reporting by  Michael Flaherty )
