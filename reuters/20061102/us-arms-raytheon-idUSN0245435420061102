 Corrects 6th paragraph to refer to Hawk missile instead of Tomahawk missile. 

 By  Andrea Shalal-Esa WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. defense company Raytheon Co. ( RTN.N ) is targeting Europe, the Middle East and Asia to capture a bigger share of growing worldwide demand for missile defense and homeland defense, a top company official told Reuters on Wednesday. International sales have accounted for about 18 percent of Raytheon annual revenues. "We're looking to grow that to over 25 percent ... over the next five years," said Torkel Patterson, a former Bush administration diplomat and national security official. He became president of Raytheon International in 2005. Waltham, Massachusetts-based Raytheon last week reported a 7-percent increase in third-quarter revenue to $5.69 billion. Taiwan, Turkey, Singapore and India are among the many countries where Raytheon hopes to boost its business, Patterson said. North Korean and Iranian nuclear programs are fueling concern worldwide about border controls and missile defense. "There is a lot of uncertainty in the world," he said, noting that with offices in 20 countries and product sales in over 70, Raytheon was well-positioned to grow internationally. The company's Hawk, Standard and Patriot missiles have already given it a presence in Saudi Arabia and other countries trying to expand homeland security and missile defense. "We are actively working our relationships. The environment in the world, terrorism and people's concerns about protecting their borders, is such that there is a market," he said. Excluding China and Russia, all other foreign defense markets amounted to about the same size as the U.S. market, he said. "So 25 percent is not an unrealistic effort," he said. India, newly opened to U.S. defense contractors, is a promising market eyeing an integrated air defense system and networked command and control systems. Raytheon was the first U.S. company to win a military sale to India after Washington lifted sanctions against the country in 2001, he said. Elsewhere in the region, Raytheon recently won deals to sell SM-2 Standard missiles to South Korea and SM-3 missile interceptors to Japan. Patterson is traveling this month to Singapore and Taiwan, where Raytheon is building a $752-million early warning radar system for Taiwan's air force to detect tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and other targets. In Europe, Patterson said he would explore opportunities in Turkey during an upcoming visit. Turkey plans a missile defense competition in which Raytheon will bid its Patriot system, which uses Lockheed Martin Corp. ( LMT.N ) PAC-3 missiles. Loren Thompson of the Virginia-based Lexington Institute, said Raytheon was hedging its bets as American sales were likely to slow after several years of strong growth. Raytheon has struggled to win a bigger share of the U.S. market but remains better known as a key subcontractor after losing several recent big systems integration contracts, said analyst Phil Finnegan of the Teal Group. Still, he said it had a good shot at expanding foreign sales, noting: "What they sell is the sort of thing that you keep replenishing."
