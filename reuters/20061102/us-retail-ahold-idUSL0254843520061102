 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - Dutch retailer Ahold NV posted a marginal rise in third-quarter sales on Thursday, but investors focused on the performance at its U.S. Foodservice business amid expectations of its imminent sale. 

 Ahold, the world's fourth-biggest food retail and food service group by sales, will present a long-anticipated retail review on Monday, with analysts expecting the sale of underperforming assets and cost cuts. "We expect the intention to sell U.S. Foodservice and (U.S. retail chain) Tops as well as possibly the stake in (Nordic retailer) ICA. Today's sales numbers ... bode well for their potential value," Kempen analyst Erwin Dut wrote in a note. Ahold, which generates about 74 percent of its turnover in the United States, is struggling to get back on track after an accounting scandal in 2003 centred on U.S. Foodservice, its catering supplies business. Barclays Capital told investors in a call last week that the most likely outcome of the review would be for Ahold to sell U.S. Foodservice and central European operations and return money to shareholders. JP Morgan said in a note it also expected Ahold to state its U.S. Foodservice was non-core, while Fortis Bank saw Ahold focusing on the sale of its central European business. The U.S. unit, valued by analysts at between 3.8 billion euros ($4.9 billion) and 5.2 billion, is seen as having few synergies with Ahold's core retail activities, while the central European business remains loss making. In the credit derivatives market, the cost of insuring Ahold's debt against default fell, with traders saying debt investors were also anticipating news of asset sales. MERGER POSSIBILITY U.S. private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice is interested in Ahold, a person familiar with the matter said, while cautioning it was not in talks with the retailer. The Financial Times earlier reported talks were underway. Ahold declined comment on the report. U.S. Foodservice had a turnover of 3.57 billion euros in the third quarter, up 0.8 percent. Hedge funds Centaurus Capital and Paulson, which together hold a 6.4 percent stake in Ahold, have urged the company to sell its U.S. activities to unlock value. Analysts said a slimmed-down Ahold could pave the way for a merger or alliance with smaller Belgian rival Delhaize, but this would take some time. "Ahold will become much smaller, and then we could see a merger on the basis of equals. The probability is increasing of this. It also makes sense geographically," said one Brussels-based trader. Ahold said third-quarter revenues rose 0.7 percent to 10.3 billion euros, compared with an average forecast of 10.18 billion in a Reuters poll of 13 analysts, as rising competition in the U.S. hurt margins, offsetting its robust Dutch unit. "Overall sales were slightly better than consensus, mainly thanks to Albert Heijn in the Netherlands. The U.S. retail business remains weak, and U.S. Foodservice was only marginally better," said Petercam analyst Stefaan Genoe. Subsidiary Albert Heijn, the Netherlands' biggest supermarket chain and one of Ahold's most lucrative businesses, increased sales by 10.3 percent to 1.6 billion euros. Ahold shares were up 0.2 percent at 8.35 euros by 1210 GMT, erasing earlier gains but slightly underperforming a 0.3 percent rise in the DJ Stoxx European retail index. Delhaize was 0.32 percent lower. Buoyed by merger speculation, Ahold is trading at 40 times estimated 2006 earnings against 17 times for the DJ Stoxx index of European retailers, according to Reuters Estimates. Five-year credit default swaps on Ahold fell 8 basis points to 105 basis points, a high-yield trader in London said, meaning it costs 105,000 euros a year to insure 10 million euros of its debt against default.
