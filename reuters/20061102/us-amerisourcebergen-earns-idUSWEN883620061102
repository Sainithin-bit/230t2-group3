 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - AmerisourceBergen Corp. ( ABC.N ) said on Thursday its quarterly net profit rose on gains in its drug distribution business and higher interest income. 

 Net profit for its fourth fiscal quarter ending September 30 was to $121.98 million, or 61 cents per share. In the year-ago quarter, when the company recorded items for early retirement of debt, employee severance and other costs, net profit was $19.50 million, or 9 cents. Analysts on average expected a profit of 56 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. In the latest quarter, net interest income was $808,000 compared with $9.4 million in interest expense in the year-ago quarter. Looking ahead, AmerisourceBergen forecast fiscal 2007 earnings to be in the range of $2.40 to $2.55 per diluted share, assuming operating revenue grows between 7 and 9 percent. The company anticipates capital expenditures of $100 million to $125 million and expects to spend $450 million to $500 million to repurchase its common shares during fiscal year 2007. AmerisourceBergen last month signed a definitive agreement with Kindred Healthcare Inc.( KND.N ) to combine their institutional pharmacy businesses into a new publicly traded company. Valley Forge, Pennsylvania AmerisourceBergen has said it expects to save $30 million in costs from the venture, which is expected to have revenue of $1.9 billion and operate in 41 states. Its shares closed on Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange at $47.14, just off the all-time peak at $48.96, set on April 3, 2006.
