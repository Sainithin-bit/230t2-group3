 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. blue-chip stocks fell for a fifth day on Thursday in the Dow's longest losing streak in more than a year, after Wal-Mart Stores Inc. gave a disappointing sales forecast and data on productivity and labor costs raised concerns about inflation and slow growth. 

 Wal-Mart ( WMT.N ), the world's largest retailer, forecast flat November sales at U.S. stores open at least a year. Its shares fell 1.2 percent, or 56 cents, to $48.29 on the New York Stock Exchange and were among the top drags on both the blue-chip Dow and the broad Standard & Poor's 500. Government data showing that labor costs grew more than expected in the third quarter while productivity was unchanged raised worries about inflation and higher interest rates, which could hurt the outlook for profits. A brokerage upgrade of computer maker Dell Inc. DELL.O helped limit the Nasdaq's decline. "A weak forecast by Wal-Mart, a multi-month high in the weekly jobless claims number along with rising unit labor costs have all helped contribute to a weaker trading session," said Michael Sheldon, chief market strategist at New York brokerage Spencer Clarke in New York. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  slipped 12.48 points, or 0.10 percent, to end at 12,018.54, in its longest losing streak since June 2005. The Dow is still near its all-time intraday high of 12,167.02. For the year, the blue-chip Dow average is up 12.1 percent. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  ended down just 0.47 of a point, or 0.03 percent, at 1,367.34. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  dipped a mere 0.33 of a point, or 0.01 percent, to close at 2,334.02. After the closing bell, shares of Whole Foods Market Inc. WFMI.O sank 15.2 percent to $51.00 in composite trading after the largest natural and organic grocer's CEO indicated total sales growth would be affected in fiscal 2007. The stock closed on Nasdaq at $60.12, down $3.04, or nearly 5 percent. BOEING FALLS, BUT J&J GAINS Earlier in the day, Target Corp. ( TGT.N ) reported weaker-than-expected same-store sales in October. The drop in Target sales suggested that Wal-Mart's problems may be broader than first thought. Target shares fell 1.3 percent, or 74 cents, to $56.96 on the NYSE. Among the Dow's biggest decliners were other blue-chip names whose fortunes are linked to economic cycles, such as Boeing Co. ( BA.N ), the big U.S. jet manufacturer, and conglomerate Honeywell International Inc. ( HON.N ). Boeing, the biggest drag on the Dow, slid 1.1 percent, or 86 cents, to $79.20. Honeywell dropped 0.8 percent, or 33 cents, to $41.87. General Electric Co. ( GE.N ), another conglomerate whose businesses range from making jet engines and light bulbs to providing news and entertainment, fell 0.5 percent, or 19 cents, to $34.71. But some investors snapped up stocks of companies that benefit from a slowing economy, including Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ.N ), which rose 1.1 percent, or 72 cents, to $67.90. J&J contributed the most to curbing the Dow's decline. INTEL DROPS AFTER DOWNGRADE Dell shares rose 3.3 percent, or 78 cents, to $24.80 and ranked among the biggest advancers in the Nasdaq 100 .NDX. Analysts at Goldman Sachs & Co. raised the rating on the personal computer maker's stock to "neutral" from "sell."  Meanwhile, Intel Corp. ( INTC.O ) fell 1.6 percent, or 34 cents, to $20.68 on Nasdaq after Merrill Lynch lowered its rating on the stock to "neutral" from "buy". Intel was the heaviest weight on both the Nasdaq 100 and the S&P 500. It also dragged on the blue-chip Dow. Trading volume was heavy on the NYSE, where about 1.68 billion shares changed hands, above last year's daily average of 1.61 billion. On the Nasdaq, about 2.00 billion shares traded, above last year's daily average of 1.80 billion. Decliners outpaced advancers on the Big Board by a ratio of about 5 to 4. On the Nasdaq, seven stocks fell for every five that rose. (Additional reporting by  Caroline Valetkevitch )
