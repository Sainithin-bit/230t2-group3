 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Aon Corp. AOC.N, the second-largest insurance brokerage company, said on Wednesday that earnings fell in the third quarter as it added $102 million to its property and casualty reserves. 

 Chicago-based Aon said net income fell to $106 million or 32 cents a share, from $122 million or 36 cents a share in the year earlier quarter. However, the company said that earnings from continuing operations, excluding certain items including an ongoing restructuring and the reserve adjustments, increased 33 percent to 44 cents a share, close to analyst expectations of 46 cents a share, as polled by Reuters. Chief Executive Greg Case said the improvement reflected progress in profit margins in both Aon's brokerage and consulting segments, Property and casualty reserves were boosted because of negative developments and additional claim information relating to programs that Aon had said it will dispose of by selling them or allowing policies to run out. Aon's three-year restructuring plan is expected to result in total pretax charges of about $300 million, the company said, with total annual cost savings of $210 million by 2008. In a separate statement, Aon proposed changes to its U.S. and U.K. defined benefit pension plans to keep them competitive, it said. Aon said it would calculate the pensions on a "career average pay" formula instead of a "final average pay." The change will affect 11,000 employees covered by the U.S. plan. U.K. plan changes would affect 1,700 employees, Aon said. Aon's shares closed down 9 cents to $34.70 on Wednesday. Its shares are trading about flat with their price at the start of the year, compared with a 3.5 percent gain in the Standard & Poor's insurance index .GSPINSC .
