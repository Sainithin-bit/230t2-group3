 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Two senior bond traders at Swiss bank UBS AG ( UBSN.VX ) are negotiating the terms of their departure amid a U.S. regulatory probe of possible manipulation of U.S. Treasury debt prices, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday. 

 The traders, who focus on the repurchase agreement, or repo market, are no longer working at the bank, the newspaper reported on its Web site, citing unnamed sources. A spokesman for UBS declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal did not name the traders, but it said that one of them has been at the bank for nine years and the other for six years. A spokesman for UBS on Monday said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into whether UBS was involved in improper manipulation of Treasury securities prices. A bond trader at UBS' rival Credit Suisse ( CSGN.VX ) recently resigned, according to a regulatory filing. The Journal previously reported the departure came amid scrutiny of the bank in the matter, but the newspaper said it was not clear which agency was involved.
