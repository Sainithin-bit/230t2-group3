 PHILADELPHIA  (Reuters) - Financial-software provider Sungard Data Systems Inc., which was taken private last year, said on Thursday revenues in the third quarter rose 9 percent, due, in part, to increased demand for consulting services. 

 Quarterly revenues totaled $1.1 billion, an increase of 9 percent over the year-ago quarter. The year-ago results exclude $12 million reduction in revenue related to accounting adjustments in the company's takeover. Adjusted income from operations was $253 million, up from $219 million a year ago, the company said.
