 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - New orders at U.S. factories rose a less-than-expected 2.1 percent in September as strength in durable goods, particularly transportation, more than offset weakness in nondurable items, a government report said on Thursday. 

 Durable goods orders gained a revised 8.3 percent in September, previously reported up 7.8 percent, the Commerce Department said. Transportation equipment jumped 28.6 percent in September after a 3.6 percent advance in August. Wall Street economists polled by Reuters had predicted a 4 percent gain in factory orders. Orders in August fell a revised 0.3 percent, previously reported as unchanged. Orders for nondurable goods, such as food and apparel, fell 4.6 percent in September after a 0.6 percent decline in August. Factory orders excluding transportation fell 2.4 percent in September while orders excluding defense-related goods gained 1.2 percent. Unfilled factory orders, a barometer of future activity, grew 3.9 percent in September, which was the 16th gain out of the last 17 months. Orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft, a gauge of underlying business capital spending, rose 2 percent after a 1.1 percent gain the prior month. Shipments at U.S. factories were down 3.5 percent in September, which was the biggest monthly decline since January 1996.
