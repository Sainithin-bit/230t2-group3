 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - New Century Financial Corp. NEW.N, one of the largest U.S. subprime mortgage lenders, on Wednesday said third-quarter profit dropped, hurt by a decline in loan production. 

 Net income for the Irvine, California-based company, which is organized as a real estate investment trust, fell to $63.5 million, or $1.12 per share, from $117.5 million, or $2.04, a year earlier.
