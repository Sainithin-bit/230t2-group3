 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. specialty apparel retailers, including Gap Inc. ( GPS.N ) and Chico's FAS Inc. ( CHS.N ), posted surprisingly weak October sales on Thursday as a lack of fresh merchandise kept consumers from buying after they loaded up on fall fashions in September. 

 Analysts and investors, who had anticipated that cold weather would drive shoppers into malls, were disappointed when companies missed their sales forecasts; shares of many retailers tumbled in early Thursday trading. "(Investors) had been piling in, and now they're probably going to pile out," said Morgan Keegan analyst Brad Stephens. "Even if weather drove people into stores, there was nothing new there to buy." Analysts also noted that companies hurt demand by offering less clearance merchandise. Shares of Gap sank 7.1 percent after the owner of the Banana Republic, Old Navy and Gap clothing chains said sales at stores open at least a year dropped 7 percent, even after a heavily promoted line of new skinny-leg jeans and its RED campaign for socially-responsible apparel manufacturing had drummed up interest. Analysts, on average, had been expecting the San Francisco-based company to post a same-store sales decrease of 2.3 percent, according to a Reuters survey. Of 27 apparel retailers tracked by Retail Metrics, 15 reported same-store sales that missed forecasts, the research firm said. Gap competitor Limited Brands Inc. ( LTD.N ) bucked the negative trend with October sales that rose more than analysts expected on soaring demand for its Victoria's Secret intimate apparel and Pink casual clothing line. The company also gave a third-quarter profit forecast ahead of Wall Street's expectations, sending shares up 2 percent. But Chico's sagged 8 percent after the company, known for clothes designed for women age 35 and over, posted a surprising decline in same-store sales. The company called its results "disappointing" and cut its third-quarter earnings estimate. AnnTaylor Stores Corp. ( ANN.N ) also posted a surprising same-store sales decline for the month after customers rejected its sweater offerings. PRICED FOR PERFECTION? The Dow Jones U.S. retail and apparel index .DJUSRA had climbed almost 16 percent this year through Wednesday, and rose 7 percent in September alone. Many investors jumped into battered retail stocks after energy prices fell, betting that consumer spending would pick up. While spending had been strong, the companies' profits likely can't justify a soaring stock price, Stephens said. "The shares got ahead of themselves," he said. "A lot of companies were priced for perfection and it's not going to be perfection." On Wednesday, Gap was selling for 16.5 times next year's expected earnings. In June, the stock sold for 12.3 times its forecasted profit. Teen retailers fared slightly better in October, though their results also missed many expectations. American Eagle Outfitters Inc. AEOS.O late on Wednesday raised its third-quarter profit forecast after October sales exceeded the company's expectations. But the same-store sales gain still missed Wall Street expectations, as did that of trendy apparel retailer Abercrombie & Fitch Co. ( ANF.N ). "They have had great comps, but you can't count on that forever," said Morningstar analyst Brady Lemos. "Whenever they stumble, they'll get hit really hard (by investors)." The stock had been up 21 percent for the year on October 30. Guess Inc. ( GES.N ), however, pleasantly surprised, posting higher October sales and forecasting fourth-quarter profit that will meet or beat Wall Street's view. The company raised its same-store sales outlook based on recent trends and its plans for holidays.
