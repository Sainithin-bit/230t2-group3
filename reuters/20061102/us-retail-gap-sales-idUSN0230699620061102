 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Gap Inc. ( GPS.N ) on Thursday said sales at stores open at least a year fell a greater-than-expected 7 percent in October as revamped stores and merchandise failed to attract shoppers. 

 Investment bank Citigroup cut its rating on the stock to "hold" from "buy," saying it was concerned that weakness at the Old Navy chain would likely continue into 2008 after a slew of management changes. Gap Inc. has lost its footing as discount department stores such as Target Corp ( TGT.N ) have stolen away shoppers with lower clothing prices. Also, Gap's shift to more fashionable offerings, away from jeans and T-shirt basics, has confused previously loyal customers. Though the operator of the Banana Republic, Old Navy and Gap chains has rolled out aggressive ad campaigns, brought in a slew of new designers and streamlined its inventory systems, sales have continued to slide. "The Oprah bounce was not enough," Lazard Capital Markets analyst Todd Slater wrote in a research note, referring to an Oprah Winfrey talk show that featured the company's Red apparel line and drove some traffic to Gap stores. Gap shares were down $1.14, or 5.4 percent, to $19.50 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange. SALES DISAPPOINT Analysts, on average, had expected the San Francisco-based clothing retailer to post a same-stores sales decrease of 2.3 percent for October, according to a Reuters survey. During October 2005, same-store sales fell 5 percent. Gap said total sales for the four weeks ended October 28 declined 3 percent to $1.25 billion. In North America, same-store sales fell 4 percent at Gap, rose 2 percent at Banana Republic, and dropped 11 percent at Old Navy. Sales at international stores declined 8 percent. For the third quarter, which also ended October 28, total net sales were flat at $3.86 billion. Analysts had expected $3.84 billion. Gap said it expects third-quarter earnings of 21 cents to 23 cents per share, including a benefit of 1 cent from a tax rate adjustment. Analysts were expecting 23 cents per share. Total merchandise margins rose from a year earlier, Gap said, without elaborating. Analysts scrutinize margin trends to help determine how much the company is selling at full price. "Although increased advertising expenditures did not materially lift traffic and (comparisons with a year earlier), we continue to see evidence of progress at Gap brand and Banana Republic," Slater wrote. "Margins were up in each of the three months, and when product was right, sales improved." The company has highlighted skinny-legged black pants in a TV commercial featuring actress Audrey Hepburn, and has heavily promoted its Red line of clothing. A portion of the proceeds from Red sales goes to a fund to fight AIDS in Africa. Gap shares rose throughout September and October as investors bet on a company revival. The stock jumped 11 percent in October alone. But that optimism may have come too early, Citigroup analyst Kimberly Greenberger said. "The 25 percent increase in the stock over the past two months has discounted much of the improvement...," she wrote in a note to clients. "We remain skeptical that new leadership at Old Navy will be able to impact the business before the first half of 2008." Gap shares are selling for 16.6 times estimated 2007 earnings, in line with an average multiple of 17 for companies in the Dow Jones retail index .DJUSRA.
