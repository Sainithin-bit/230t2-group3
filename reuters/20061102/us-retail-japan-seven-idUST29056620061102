 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Seven & I Holdings Co. ( 3382.T ), Japan's biggest retail group, said on Thursday its 7-Eleven convenience stores will introduce low-priced bottled drinks, a move which could spark a soft drink price war. 

 Japanese convenience stores once attracted shoppers even without discounts but are recently facing tougher competition from drug stores, discount stores, and supermarkets that tend to offer cheaper products and open long hours. Seven-Eleven Japan will offer privately branded 98-yen ($0.85) tea drinks in 500 milliliter plastic bottles from November 21, against just below 150 yen for national brand products. The move had little impact on shares in Seven & I, but rival bottled tea makers such as Ito En Ltd. ( 2593.T ) and Asahi Soft Drinks 2598.T took a hit. Minoru Matsumoto, a spokesman at Seven & I, parent of Seven-Eleven Japan, said it will choose outlets to offer the tea drinks depending on store locations and customers. He estimated the new products will contribute to around 1-2 percent of soft drink sales at each store, which make up about 10 percent of overall sales. Lawson Inc. ( 2651.T ), Japan's second-biggest convenience store chain, said it has not yet decided whether it would also introduce cheaper bottled drinks, while third-ranked FamilyMart ( 8028.T ) said it does not immediately plan to follow suit. Japanese convenience stores continuously logged a fall in same-store sales since August 2004 except last June when strong tobacco demand ahead of a July tax hike boosted sales. Shares in Seven & I were unchanged at 3,690 yen as of 0149 GMT. Ito En was down 2.7 percent at 3,580 yen, while Asahi Soft Drinks was down 2 percent at 1,634 yen. Lawson was up 0.5 percent at 3,990 yen and FamilyMart was up 2.9 percent at 3,200 yen. The Nikkei average  .N225  was down 0.67 percent. ($1=117.04 Yen)
