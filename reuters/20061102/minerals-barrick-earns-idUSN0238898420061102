 TORONTO  Nov 2 (Reuters) - Barrick Gold Corp. ( ABX.TO ) said
on Thursday its third-quarter profit almost quadrupled on
higher gold prices and a boost in production from its takeover
of Placer Dome.  But even after snapping up Placer Dome earlier this year to
become the world's biggest gold producer, Barrick continues to
look for ways to pad its portfolio.  The company entered into a preliminary agreement with
Russia's Highland Gold Mining ( HGM.L ) and increased its
ownership to 34 percent. Barrick is still after NovaGold
Resources ( NG.TO ) to consolidate assets in British Columbia and
nab NovaGold's stake in the Donlin Creek project in Alaska.  "I think they haven't finished with their acquisitions.
NovaGold, I think, is just a tidbit. I think there are bigger
ones," said analyst John Ing, president of Maison Placements.   For the three months ended Sept. 30, Barrick earned $405
million, or 46 cents a share, up from $113 million, or 21 cents
a share, in the year-earlier period.  Barrick said special items cut earnings by $45 million, or
5 cents a share. Excluding those items, the company earned 51
cents a share, which beat analysts forecasts of 48 cents a
share, according to Reuters Estimates.  "I thought they were pretty good. They were in line with
what I expected," said Ing.  Operating cash flow was a record $805 million, or 92 cents
a share, up from $232 million, or 43 cents a share.  Barrick produced 2.2 million ounces of gold in the quarter
at total cash costs of $281 an ounce. That compared with 1.5
million ounces at $210 an ounce a year earlier.  The jump in production was due to its recent acquisition of
gold miner Placer Dome.  Barrick said it expects to meet its original 2006 gold
production and cost outlook of about 8.6 million ounces of gold
at total cash costs of about $285 an ounce.  Barrick said it realized $581 an ounce on its gold sales in
the quarter, during which it sold all its gold production at
spot prices. It incurred a $79 million charge against gold
sales for the impact of the previously announced Placer Dome
hedge book close-out.  The miner said it plans to sell its interests in the South
Deep mine and the Paddington operations in Australia.  It said production at Nevada's Goldstrike mine is expected
to be about 15 percent lower in 2007 as the site will be
processing lower-grade ore stockpiles for about eight months
due to waste stripping in the open pit.  Shares of Barrick eased 20 Canadian cents to C$35 on the
Toronto Stock Exchange. On the New York Stock Exchange, the
stock was off 17 cents at $30.82.  ($1=$1.14 Canadian)
