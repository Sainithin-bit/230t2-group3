 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Energizer Holdings Inc. ( ENR.N ), the No. 2 U.S. battery and razor maker, posted a 24.5 percent drop in quarterly profit on Thursday as it grappled with soaring prices for zinc, a key battery component, and took charges, sending its shares down 7 percent. 

 The company also said it has initiated another round of price increases, including a U.S. hike set for January, since its previously price increases will not be enough to offset the higher zinc prices in the current quarter. Profit dropped to $39.1 million, or 66 cents per share, in the fiscal fourth quarter ended September 30, from $51.8 million, or 72 cents per share, a year earlier. St. Louis-based Energizer took charges of 23 cents per share related to its restructuring in Europe, and a charge of 6 cents per share to record foreign pension costs. Energizer said that during the current quarter it discovered that one of its international subsidiaries failed to adjust its statutory pension accounting to principles generally accepted in the United States. That led to an understatement in pretax earnings and pension liability. The company said the error was not material to previous financial statements. The charges were partially offset by 13 cents in tax benefits and adjustments. Energizer said the costs of key metals it uses to make batteries, primarily zinc, have increased significantly. Zinc prices are still rising from historic highs in 2006. At current prices, zinc costs for 2007 will be more than double 2006 rates, Energizer said. The company said if products sold during 2006 had been produced at costs expected for 2007, product expenses would have been $60 million to $65 million higher. Sales rose 5 percent to $830.1 million, driven by sales of batteries. Razor sales were essentially flat at $255 million. Shares of Energizer were down $5.48 at $72.17 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange after falling to $72.05.
