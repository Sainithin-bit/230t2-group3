 LONDON  (Reuters) - A global indicator based on national surveys of manufacturers fell in October to its lowest level since August 2005, a report showed on Thursday. 

 The indicator, produced by JP Morgan with research and supply management organizations, fell to 53.9 in October from 54.7. The fall in the global factory PMI comes a day after the U.S. Institute for Supply Management said its factory index slipped to 51.2 last month from 52.9 in September, below Wall Street forecasts and its lowest level since June 2003. The index combines survey data from countries including the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, China and Russia.
