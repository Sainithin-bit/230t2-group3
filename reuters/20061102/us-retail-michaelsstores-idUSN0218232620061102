 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Arts and crafts retailer Michaels Stores Inc. ( MIK.N ), which was sold to affiliates of Bain Capital Partners, LLC and The Blackstone Group for $6 billion, on Thursday said third-quarter same-store sales rose 3.3 percent. 

 The Irving, Texas-based company said total sales during the third-quarter rose to $896.1 million, from $839.7 million a year ago, helped by higher sales in its general crafts division. As a result of the sale of the company, which was completed Tuesday, Michaels said it will no longer issue quarterly same-store sales releases and said its future sales results will be incorporated into required public filings.
