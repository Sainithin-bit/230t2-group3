 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. retailers posted disappointing October sales on Thursday, and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) forecast flat November sales at U.S. stores open at least a year, raising fears about the critical holiday shopping season. 

 But analysts said the lackluster October results may have stemmed from consumers taking a breather after spending heavily for back-to-school merchandise in September, and might not signal weak holiday trends. "It's possible that September was so strong that it pulled in some sales from October," said Sarah Henry, investment analyst with Sovereign Asset Management, which holds Wal-Mart and Target shares. Wall Street was expecting retailers to post solid October sales on the heels of lower gasoline prices and cooler temperatures. Early wintry weather descended on the Midwestern and Eastern United States, making last month the third-coldest October in 10 years, according Planalytics. Fuel prices also remained low, with the average price for a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline at $2.22, close to the lowest level since last December, according to the most recent weekly report from the Energy Information Administration. But 61 percent of U.S. retailers reported October sales below expectations, according to Retail Metrics. In a bright spot, department store operators Federated Department Stores Inc. FD.N, J.C. Penney Co. Inc. ( JCP.N ) and Nordstrom Inc. ( JWN.N ), which have focused on increasing their selection of fashionable merchandise, posted strong gains. But many retailers have struggled with fall fashions, and specialty apparel retailers like Chico's FAS Inc. ( CHS.N ), Gap Inc. ( GPS.N ) and American Eagle Outfitters AEOS.O reported sales below Wall Street expectations. BROADER SLOWDOWN? Wal-Mart earlier disappointed investors with preliminary October sales growth of just 0.5 percent at U.S. stores open at least a year, its smallest gain in more than two years and below company expectations. Since the report on October 28, investors have been trying to determine whether Wal-Mart's problems are its own or a sign of a broader spending slowdown. Wal-Mart, which is looked at as a bellwether for the sector, is struggling with selling trendy merchandise and remodeling its stores, which has hurt sales. On Thursday, Wal-Mart was joined by Costco Wholesale Corp. ( COST.O ) and Target Corp. ( TGT.N ) in reporting lower-than-expected October sales, with all three facing tough comparisons from strong monthly sales a year ago. Pat Conroy, vice chairman of Deloitte & Touche USA's consumer business practice, said October sales likely got squeezed by the awkward time period between back-to-school shopping and the holiday gift-giving season. He now expects retailers to promote heavily to drive sales this holiday season to convince consumers to spend holiday cash sooner rather than later. "What we think they really need to focus on this year is to make sure that they convert the shoppers," he said. "Shoppers again this year will be visiting less stores and so once you've got them in that store, you've really better have a good customer experience to convert them into a buyer." Wal-Mart has already slashed prices on more than 100 toys and games, setting the stage for a competitive holiday season. (Additional reporting by  Emily Kaiser  in Chicago)
