 LONDON  (Reuters) - Advertising giant WPP and U.S. private equity firm Hellman & Friedman plan to launch a joint bid worth 800 million to 1 billion euros ($1.02 billion to $1.28 billion) for agency Sportfive, a newspaper said on Thursday. 

 Mediapro, an associate company of WPP ( WPP.L ), was working with Hellman & Friedman, the Daily Telegraph reported, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter. The consortium was due to make a second-round bid for the agency, which holds TV rights to the European football cup in 2008, by the end of this week, it said. WPP, the world's second-largest advertising and marketing company, was not immediately available for comment. Sources familiar with the situation told Reuters in July that the owners of Sportfive planned to sell the company in a deal worth up to 1 billion euros. U.S. private investor Advent has a controlling stake in Sportfive, while broadcaster RTL AUDK.LU owns 25 percent and Sportfive's management 10 percent, with a small stake in the hands of U.S. bank Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ). As well as the European TV rights for Euro 2008 in Austria and Switzerland, Sportfive holds the rights to market the top football leagues in Italy and Spain and the home games of the English national team.
