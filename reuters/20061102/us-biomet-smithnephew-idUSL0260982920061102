 LONDON  (Reuters) - Europe's biggest medical devices maker Smith & Nephew Plc ( SN.L ) has held "very preliminary talks" over a tie-up with U.S. rival Biomet Inc BMET.O, S&N said on Thursday as it met forecasts for third-quarter earnings. 

 Combining Smith & Nephew and Biomet would help the two firms close the gap on the market leaders for joint implants, U.S. groups Stryker Corp ( SYK.N ), Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ.N ) and Zimmer Holdings Inc ( ZMH.N ). Analysts said a tie-up would most likely take the form of an offer by S&N for Biomet pitched at between $10.5 billion and $12 billion, although a deal was not certain, since the U.S. firm was also likely to attract private-equity interest. Biomet later issued a statement confirming preliminary talks with S&N but said it had not decided if it was in its interest to strike a deal with any third party. Biomet stock rose 3.8 percent to $38.83 by 1715 GMT on Nasdaq, while S&N closed 4.2 percent down at 487-3/4 pence on speculation any deal would be part funded by new shares, diluting earnings for existing shareholders in the short term. "Biomet is an innovator in the orthopaedics space," S&N Chief Executive Chris O'Donnell told reporters. "We are interested in innovative companies, large or small." But O'Donnell reiterated his view that it is difficult to strike successful merger and acquisition deals among big orthopaedics companies, because there are few synergies in such firms' biggest cost area -- their sales forces. "We've always said this is a challenging thing to do for a prudent company like Smith & Nephew," he told a conference call. S&N has long been tipped as a bidder for Biomet, which hired investment bank Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) in April to consider its strategic options. A source close to the matter has told Reuters the two firms held talks this summer, but no offer was made. ING Financial Markets analyst Max Herrmann said it was no surprise S&N was talking to Biomet, but was skeptical of a deal. "This is not the case of a company with a very low multiple like Centerpulse that was recovering," he said, referring to S&N's failed attempts to buy Swiss medical firm Centerpulse in 2003. S&N dropped that bid after being trumped by Zimmer. Biomet shares have risen as much as 18 percent in the past month amid speculation it could attract a bid. The Financial Times said the U.S. group was also believed to have held talks with the private equity arm of JP Morgan ( JPM.N ). DEAL OR NO DEAL "They would be lucky to get away with a 20 percent premium," Nomura Code analyst Michael King said of any offer by S&N for Biomet. Biomet has a market value of about $9.3 billion compared with S&N's 4.8 billion pounds ($9.2 billion). S&N shares trade at about 21 times forecast earnings, compared with 20 times for Biomet, according to Reuters Estimates. King said S&N was likely to fund any deal with about $4 billion of debt and would pay for the rest either with shares or via a rights issue. Analysts also said S&N could sell Biomet's dental business, which they said was worth about $2 billion. S&N reported a 6 percent rise in earnings per share before goodwill to 10.3 U.S. cents in the three months to September 30, on a 10 percent rise in revenues to $679 million, and kept its forecast for 2006 underlying earnings growth of 3 to 5 percent. Third-quarter earnings estimates ranged from 10.0 cents to 10.9 cents and revenue forecasts from $664 million to $677 million, according to a Reuters poll of six analysts. O'Donnell said S&N's sales of orthopaedic reconstruction devices, such as replacement hips and knees, rose 13 percent in the third quarter, boosted by new launches such as Journey and Legion knees and Birmingham hips. This significantly outperformed a market growing about 7 percent, he said, adding S&N's track record of outperforming rivals showed it did not need to do a deal to get bigger. "There may be an opportunity (to do a deal), but it's certainly not a problem (if S&N does not)," he said. Goldman Sachs analysts said S&N and Biomet together would have 14 percent of the global orthopaedics market, level with Zimmer and behind Stryker and Johnson & Johnson on 15 percent. S&N said it was also reviewing all of its businesses in a bid to drive down costs and improve profit margins. O'Donnell declined to say if this would involve job cuts or by how much the firm hoped to lift margins. But he noted S&N generally trailed the "best-in-class" margins in its different businesses by between 300 and 500 basis points. (Additional reporting by Deborah Haynes and  Ben Hirschler )
