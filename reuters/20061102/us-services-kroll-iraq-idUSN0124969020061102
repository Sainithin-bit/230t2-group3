 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - U.S. security company Kroll has not pulled its staff from Iraq or Afghanistan but is looking to sell a UK-based subsidiary that operates in the two countries, Kroll's chief executive said on Wednesday. 

 The company, a division of insurance broker Marsh & McLennan Companies Inc. ( MMC.N ), said it was considering the sale of Kroll Security International to focus on consulting and training for corporations and wealthy individuals. "We haven't pulled anybody out of Iraq or Afghanistan," Kroll Chief Executive Simon Freakley said in a phone interview. "We are focused on our staff and our clients there." His comments came after Marsh & McLennan Chief Executive Michael Cherkasky was quoted in media reports on Wednesday as saying Kroll had already withdrawn its teams from Iraq and Afghanistan. Freakley said even if Kroll sells the unit, it could have a presence in the two countries should clients require it. Kroll Security International, which works mainly with aid and governmental organizations, now has 350 employees in Iraq and 50 in Afghanistan. Two of its workers were killed in Iraq in January 2005, while a Kroll employee died in December 2005, the company said. News of the possible sale by Kroll comes after the San Francisco Chronicle reported that privately held Bechtel Corp. would leave Iraq after three years following the expiration of the engineering company's last government contract there.
