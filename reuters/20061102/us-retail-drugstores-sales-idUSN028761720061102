 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - The top three U.S. drugstore chains on Thursday reported October sales that beat expectations, nudging shares higher a day after investors fled the stocks on the heels of CVS Corp.'s ( CVS.N ) plan to buy Caremark Rx Inc. CMX.N. 

 Solid growth in sales at drugstores open at least a year -- a key retail measure known as same-store sales -- was one of the few bright spots in otherwise bleak day for retailers. According to research firm Retail Metrics, 61 percent of retailers missed analysts' sales expectations. Drugstores and department stores were the only two sectors to come in ahead of same-store sales forecasts, the firm said. The results also put to rest initial fears that Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s ( WMT.N ) $4 generic drug plan would crimp sales at the traditional drugstore chains. CVS Chief Financial Officer David Rickard said his company has seen little impact so far from Wal-Mart's plan, which debuted in Florida in September and was rolled out to more states in October. Walgreen Co. ( WAG.N ), the No. 1 U.S. drugstore chain in terms of revenue, said same-store sales rose 11.4 percent, and total sales were up 18.2 percent to $4.31 billion. Analysts, on average, expected Deerfield, Illinois-based Walgreen's same-store sales to rise 9.5 percent, according to Retail Metrics. CVS said same-store sales gained 9.3 percent in October, while analysts expected a rise of 8.2 percent, according to Retail Metrics. Total revenue at CVS jumped 24.4 percent to $3.5 billion for the four weeks ended October 28. At Rite Aid Corp. ( RAD.N ), the No. 3 U.S. chain, same-store sales advanced 4 percent, ahead of the average analyst view of 3.3 percent, according to Retail Metrics. Rite Aid's total drugstore sales rose 4.2 percent to $1.32 billion for the four weeks ended October 28. CVS KEEPS VIEW CVS said its same-store sales should rise 6 percent to 8 percent in the current quarter, and 7.5 percent to 8 percent for the full year. The company expects to earn 41 cents to 43 cents per share in the fourth quarter, bringing full-year earnings to $1.52 to $1.54 per share. Analysts, on average, had been expecting CVS to earn 43 cents per share in the fourth quarter, and $1.54 per share this year, according to Reuters Estimates. Walgreen rose 32 cents at $42.43, while Rite Aid added 8 cents, or 1.8 percent, at $4.60, and CVS stock was up 1 cent at $29.04 after rising to $29.50 in early trading, all on the New York Stock Exchange. CVS had 6,172 stores as of October 28, while Walgreen had 5,515 stores as of October 31. Rite Aid trailed with 3,317 stores as of October 28. But the Camp Hill, Pennsylvania-based company plans to buy the U.S. Eckerd and Brooks chains from Canada's Jean Coutu Group (PJC) Inc. ( PJCa.TO ). If that deal closes as expected, Rite Aid would have about 5,177 stores. None of the chains have matched Wal-Mart's $4 drug plan.
