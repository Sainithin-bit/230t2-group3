  By  Sinead Carew NEW YORK  Nov 2 (Reuters) - Wireless technology and chip
supplier Qualcomm Inc. ( QCOM.O ) said on Thursday its quarterly
profit rose 14 percent as revenue climbed on strong demand for
its cell phone chips.  Earnings were slightly better than analysts' estimates for
the fiscal fourth quarter. But investors may be disappointed by
Qualcomm's first-quarter revenue forecast, which indicated it
may fall short of Wall Street expectations, analysts said.  "The stock might be a little bit weak because the top end
of the guidance for the December period just reaches what the
street was expecting," said Charter Equity Research analyst Ed
Snyder.  Qualcomm said net profit for its fiscal fourth quarter
ended Sept. 24 rose to $614 million, or 36 cents per share,
from $538 million, or 32 cents per share, a year ago. Revenue
rose 28 percent to $2 billion.  Excluding its investment arm and other items, Qualcomm said
it earned 42 cents per share, edging analysts' average
expectations of 41 cents per share and revenue of $1.97
billion, according to Reuters Estimates.  Qualcomm expects fiscal first-quarter earnings of 42 cents
to 44 cents per share, excluding items. It forecast revenue of
$1.98 billion to $2.08 billion for the quarter. Analysts on
average are looking for 44 cents per share on revenue of $2.07
billion for the first quarter.  Qualcomm forecast 2007 earnings of $1.76 to $1.81 per
share, excluding items, on revenue of $8.1 billion to $8.6
billion.  NOKIA DEAL DEADLINE  Qualcomm is working to renegotiate a licensing pact with
phone maker Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ) ahead of an April 9 deadline. It
said it is "not optimistic" they  will reach an agreement in
time because of the current slow progress of the talks.  If they fail to reach a deal by then and Nokia does not pay
technology royalties as a result, Qualcomm said this could
shave 4 cents to 6 cents per share off its earnings for the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2007.  It said that risk was not reflected its 2007 forecast.  Analysts called the estimate of the potential financial hit
"reasonable," and Snyder said Qualcomm's openness about the
risk should cheer investors.  "That's a good idea on their part to quantify the potential
impact," he said.  Qualcomm stock has fallen by about 30 percent in the last 6
months, partly on uncertainty created by legal disputes with
Nokia and other companies.  Nokia is one of several major technology companies that
have complained to European regulators about Qualcomm's
competitive practices.  Qualcomm dominates the market for chips based on CDMA --
the most widely used mobile phone technology in the United
States -- and also sells technology licenses and chips for
phones based on W-CDMA, a high-speed wireless technology
popular in Europe and other parts of the world.  The company said the mid-point of its estimated range for
WCDMA phone shipments in calendar year 2007 is 175 million
compared with its estimate for 98 million in 2006. The mid-point for its forecast for CDMA handsets was 203
million for 2007 up from its 196 million estimate for 2006.  Qualcomm shares dipped slightly in extended electronic
trading to $36.20 from their Nasdaq close at $36.36.
