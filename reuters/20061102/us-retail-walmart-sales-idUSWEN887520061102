 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) on Thursday forecast flat November sales at U.S. stores open at least a year, sounding a sour note for the start of the vital holiday shopping season and sending its stock lower in early electronic trading. 

 The world's biggest retailer also said October U.S. same-store sales rose a paltry 0.5 percent, its smallest gain in more than two years and below its lowered expectations. Total sales rose 11.7 percent to $25.71 billion for the four-week period ended October 27. Wal-Mart has struggled with tepid demand for its trendy clothing, and acknowledged that styles such as skinny jeans did not resonate with its core customers. "We're continuing to work longer-term to improve the balance between fashion and core essentials in our stores," Chief Financial Officer Tom Schoewe said in a statement. Remodeling projects at hundreds of its stores also hurt sales, although Wal-Mart said it would wrap up those efforts in the next two weeks so stores would not be disrupted during the holiday shopping season. Wal-Mart has vowed to aggressively cut prices during the holiday season, and started last month by lowering prices on more than 100 toys and games. Schoewe said price cuts boosted sales volume, and Wal-Mart was pressing ahead with plans for similar holiday season specials on key electronics. "We have expanded our (electronics) brand offerings, improved our product presentations in the store, reinforced our value pricing and doubled the assortment of accessories," he said. Wal-Mart's stock was down 1.5 percent to $48.11 in early electronic trading, from Wednesday's New York Stock Exchange closing price of $48.85.
