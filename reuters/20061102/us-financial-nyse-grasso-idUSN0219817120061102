 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, in a state court filing on Thursday, said former New York Stock Exchange Chairman Richard Grasso should return $112.2 million in compensation to the Big Board. 

 According to the filing, Spitzer's office concluded Grasso must return $81.5 million in pension payments made to him in September 2003, $12.35 million interest on two loans extended to Grasso and $18.32 million of unvested funds paid to Grasso from his supplemental executive savings plan in September 2003. Excluding interest on the loans, this amount "represents slightly more than half" of the $187.5 million package paid to Grasso for heading the NYSE. "We think the motion speaks for itself," said a spokesman for the Attorney General. Lawyers for the NYSE declined to comment and Grasso's lawyers were not immediately available for comment. Last month New York Supreme Court Judge Charles Ramos handed down a partial summary judgment that concluded Grasso violated his fiduciary duties by not keeping the Big Board's directors fully informed about the compensation he had accrued over the years under various plans. Ramos ruled Grasso should return much of the $187.5 million compensation he received as the NYSE's head and dismissed Grasso's motions to dismiss certain claims. As part of the ruling, Ramos asked for a full accounting of the amounts that should be repaid, as supported by Grasso's contracts and other NYSE documents. Spitzer, who filed suit against Grasso in 2004, last month estimated Grasso would have to repay about $100 million of his previously granted salary, bonus and retirement pay. Spitzer, who seeks election as New York governor next week, said Grasso's pay was unreasonably high and violated the state's laws for nonprofit organizations. Grasso was forced out of the NYSE in 2003 amid the public uproar caused by the disclosure of his pay package. On October 27 Grasso filed a motion with the state's appellate division challenging the judge's decision. The motion accuses Ramos of ignoring certain evidence and of "numerous errors of law and fact."
