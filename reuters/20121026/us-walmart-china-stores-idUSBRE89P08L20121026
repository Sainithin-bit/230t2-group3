 SHANGHAI  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ) plans to open 100 more stores in China and create 18,000 jobs there over the next three years, it said on Friday, in a bid to boost its presence in China's booming but highly competitive hypermarket sector. 
 Wal-Mart, which has 370 stores and over 100,000 employees in China, was a pioneer in the market, but now faces much greater competition from Britain's Tesco Plc ( TSCO.L ), Germany's Metro AG ( MEOG.DE ), France's Carrefour ( CARR.PA ) and domestic firms, as well as a slowing economy. China's hypermarket sector, in which retail sales reached 506.9 billion yuan ($81 billion) last year according to Euromonitor, includes the world's three largest retailers in Wal-Mart, Carrefour and Tesco, and domestic brands led by Sun Art Retail Group ( 6808.HK ).
