 CALGARY, Alberta  (Reuters) - EnCana Corp ( ECA.TO ) said on Sunday that it expects its independent natural gas business to grow at a 7 to 9 percent annual clip while its oil sands operations will have annual growth in a 4 to 6 percent range after the two are spun into new firms. 

 EnCana chief executive Randy Eresman told reporters that he expects the natural gas business to be worth two-thirds of the company's market capitalization, now around $65 billion, once the split is complete next year, with the oil sands spin off accounting for the remainder. The oil sands business also expects to divest about $100 million in assets a year. (Reporting by  Scott Haggett ; editing by Renato Andrade)
