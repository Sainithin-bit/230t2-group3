 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. ( AMTD.O ) has been talking to rival online brokers about potential deals, its CEO said the day after the company disclosed two hedge funds had pushed it to pursue a merger. 

 Chief Executive Joe Moglia told CNBC television on Wednesday that TD Ameritrade would continue to talk to others, but he said the company needed to be "very thoughtful and deliberate," given the risks any deal would involve. TD Ameritrade shares rose more than 4 percent, while the shares of rival E*Trade Financial Corp. ( ETFC.O ), gained nearly 6 percent in afternoon trading. Hedge funds JANA Partners and S.A.C. Capital Advisors, which control about 8.4 percent of TD Ameritrade, have told the company it should merge with either of its rivals, E*Trade Financial or Charles Schwab Corp. SCHW.O to boost shareholder value. Schwab, which said on Tuesday that it was not interested in taking over TD Ameritrade, has a market value of $27 billion. E*Trade has a market cap of $10 billion, about $2 billion less than TD Ameritrade. The two funds have also sought regulatory approval to acquire more TD Ameritrade shares, the company reported in a regulatory filing on Tuesday. Representatives of Toronto-Dominion Bank ( TD.TO ) on TD Ameritrade's board "may be standing in the way of this result for shareholders," the funds said. A Toronto-Dominion spokesman disagreed on Tuesday, but said the bank, which has a 40 percent stake in TD Ameritrade, supported the brokerage's organic growth strategy. ANALYSTS SUPPORT MERGER Deutsche Bank analysts Matthew Fischer and Mike Mayo said there were several merits to such a merger. "We recommend E*Trade and Charles Schwab on fundamentals and a merger involving E*Trade would be a bonus," they wrote in a research note. The analysts said a merger with E*Trade would combine TD Ameritrade's larger branch office network with E*Trade's international exposure and integrated bank/broker model. Jonathan Woodley, a portfolio manager at Munder Capital Management, agreed E*Trade might be the more viable candidate due to complementary areas of expertise. "We'd be in favor of it as things stand right now and it's good these talks are happening," he said. Consolidation in the industry would remove redundancies and extraneous costs and drive long-term revenues, he said. Birmingham, Michigan-based Munder Capital owns nearly 3.6 million shares of TD Ameritrade and 841,184 shares of E*Trade. Woodley said all the merger talk might bring other smaller brokerages or the online brokerage divisions of larger firms into play as well. "For instance, there's been some talk of optionsXpress OXPS.O," he said. In April, many analysts and executives forecast another round of mergers in the industry after several discount brokerages lowered full-year forecasts due to lower trade volumes, as retail investors exited the stock market. TD Ameritrade said in its filing that it continually reviewed its business plan and stand-alone strategy, as well as potential strategic combinations with rivals. The brokerage has also publicly stated it was interested in growing through a merger if the time was right and it could reach an agreement for the right strategic fit. It also said it formed a standing mergers and acquisitions committee to evaluate and review strategic investments and mergers. TD Ameritrade shares were up 79 cents, or 4 percent, at $20.74 in afternoon trading on Nasdaq, while E*Trade rose $1.37, or 5.7 percent, to $25.23, and Schwab fell about 1 percent, or 21 cents, to $21.83.
