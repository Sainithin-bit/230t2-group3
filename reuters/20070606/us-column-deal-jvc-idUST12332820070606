 TOKYO  (Reuters) - U.S. private equity firm Texas Pacific Group's TPG.UL bid for Japanese consumer electronics maker JVC 6792.T is struggling to win backing from lenders, putting the roughly $560 million deal in jeopardy, sources familiar with the matter say. 

 If TPG does not come up with a creative way to fund the deal soon then the bidding may be reopened to other suitors, with buyout house Cerberus CBS.UL and rival electronics maker Kenwood Corp. 6765.T seen as potential candidates. Private equity firms fund their acquisitions with a mixture of debt and a smaller amount of equity. They generally call on banks to provide the debt and put up the equity themselves. However, banks have resisted funding the acquisition of JVC, whose official name is Victor Co. of Japan Ltd., because they are unconvinced that TPG could turn around a company heading for its fourth straight annual loss. "The business plan was not outlandish for a profitable company, but for a company that is losing money like JVC, it seemed too ambitious," a banking source said. Private equity firms have struggled to make their mark in Japan despite the presence of some of the largest firms in the business such as Kohlberg Kravis Roberts KKR.UL and Permira  PERM.UL. Many Japanese executives are wary of selling assets to private equity firms because some funds made spectacular profits turning around risky investments while Japan was recovering from the bursting of an asset price bubble in the late nineties. TPG has managed to ink a few Japanese deals, the most recent being a purchase in March of a 14 percent stake in toy maker Tomy Co. Ltd ( 7867.T ), worth about $93 million at current levels. TROUBLESOME CHILD Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Ltd. ( 6752.T ), the world's largest consumer electronics maker, has been trying to sell its 52.4 percent stake in JVC because its losses have been weighing on its consolidated performance. Matsushita chose TPG's Asian buyout arm, TPG Newbridge, as its preferred bidder back in March, because it offered a higher price than rival private equity suitors Cerberus and Permira. But TPG and Matsushita continued to haggle over the final price and the amount of capital TPG would inject. "Both sides kept breaking deadlines," said another source. Other sources said TPG would not buy JVC at the valuation suggested by its share price, and Matsushita could not convince its key shareholders to accept a below-market price. Shares in JVC closed 1.74 percent lower on Wednesday at 509 yen, valuing the 52.4 percent of shares owned by Matsushita at about 68 billion yen ($561 million). JVC has been struggling to compete with larger rivals such as Sony Corp. ( 6758.T ) and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. ( 005930.KS ) in the global flat TV market, which has unnerved the Japanese and foreign banks asked to finance the acquisition. DEJA VU TPG's first proposal was to create a holding company to acquire JVC shares, but that fell on stony ground. Next, TPG asked banks to refinance JVC's existing debt, but again struggled to find backers. For JVC, the whole scenario provokes a sense of deja vu. "Matsushita has tried to sell JVC several times in the past and it has failed because the banks are unwilling to fund the sale," said one of the sources. Cerberus tabled a lower bid than TPG, with the support of JVC's management and less-restrictive terms and conditions. If TPG's bid lapses then Cerberus may be willing to step in with the support of JVC's management. Japanese audio equipment maker Kenwood is another potential candidate for the shares. Kenwood's interest in JVC was mentioned in the preliminary stages of the auction. A spokesman for Kenwood said that consolidation within the car electronics industry was needed. JVC's product line includes DVD players and audio speakers. A spokesman for TPG declined to comment. A Matsushita spokesman said no decision had been made on its JVC holding.
