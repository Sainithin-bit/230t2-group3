 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Worker productivity grew at a slower pace than initially estimated in the first quarter, driving up labor costs and reinforcing concerns about inflation. 

 The Labor Department reported on Wednesday that nonfarm productivity, a measure of how much any given worker can produce in an hour, advanced at a 1 percent annualized pace in the quarter, driving up unit labor costs by 1.8 percent. Economists were expecting the Labor Department report to show weaker productivity and higher labor costs after the government reported gross domestic product grew at just a 0.6 percent annual rate during the first quarter. "It indicates growth was not so great in the first quarter and that went straight into productivity," said Nigel Gault, chief U.S. economist at Global Insight in Waltham, Massachusetts. "As far as the Fed is concerned, they are not going to be surprised, but this reminds them that wage pressure is still the number one inflation risk, at least domestically," he added. U.S. stocks fell sharply for a second day on Wednesday as the data fueled concerns that inflation and rising interest rates will hurt corporate profits. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  closed down 129.8 points, or nearly 1 percent. U.S. Treasuries rose moderately amid the stock losses. The productivity data, however, was considered backward-looking and barely caused a ripple in the government bond market. Economists believe the first quarter marked a low point for the U.S. economy and now look for economic growth to quicken, which means productivity growth should pick up a bit as well. The first-quarter productivity figure, revised from the government's 1.7 percent estimate a month ago, was followed by the Bush administration's downgraded assessment of the economy for this year. In a forecast, the White House Council of Economic Advisers, Treasury Department and Office of Management and Budget revised down a forecast for 2007 GDP growth to 2.3 percent this year from 2.9 percent. But administration officials expect stronger growth later this year. "A variety of indicators signal a faster-growing U.S. economy for the rest of this year," said Edward Lazear, chairman of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers. "Unemployment remains remarkably low, business inventories are lean compared with sales and now industrial production is on the rise." PLANNED JOB CUTS RISE FROM YEAR AGO On the labor front, U.S. employers announced plans in May to eliminate 71,115 jobs, up 32 percent from May 2006 when job cuts totaled 53,716. It was the second consecutive month in which job cuts increased from the year earlier period, according to the monthly job-cut report released on Wednesday by global outplacement consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas, Inc. Still, year to date, the pace of job cutting remains below last year's level, but the gap is rapidly closing. Downsizing in the computer industry dominated the May job cuts. "Heavy job cutting in the computer industry reflects a slowdown in business spending on new technology. We may continue to see heavy cuts in the months ahead with spending expected to remain soft in the near future," said John A. Challenger, chief executive officer at the Chicago-based firm. A separate report showed rising mortgage rates dampened demand for home loans last week, with an increase in applications for loans to purchase homes overshadowed by a drop in refinancings. The Mortgage Bankers Association's mortgage application index slipped 1.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted 625.3 in the week ended June 1 as long-term interest rates hit their highest level since October.
