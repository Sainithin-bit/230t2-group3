 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - American Eagle Outfitters Inc. ( AEO.N ) on Wednesday said May sales at stores open at least a year rose 5 percent, slightly missing Wall Street targets, but the teen clothing retailer reiterated its second-quarter earnings forecast. 

 Analysts, on average, had expected American Eagle to post a monthly sales increase of 5.7 percent, according to a Reuters survey. The company said total sales rose 18 percent to $199.2 million for the four weeks ended June 2, from $168.8 million in the comparable period a year earlier. American Eagle said that May same-store sales showed "meaningful improvement" compared with April, adding that customers responded well to its summer merchandise offerings, such as shorts and dresses. For the second quarter, American Eagle said it still expects earnings of 34 to 36 cents per share, compared with analyst expectations of 36 cents per share. The company's stock, which rose as high as $27.65 a share, closed trading on the New York Stock Exchange at $27.01, up 38 cents.
