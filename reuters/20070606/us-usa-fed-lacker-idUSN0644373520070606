 FREDERICK, Maryland  (Reuters) - Richmond Federal Reserve Bank President Jeffrey Lacker said on Wednesday that figures on inflation excluding food and energy prices have fluctuated, and it is hard to say if 'core' inflation is on a downward path. 

 "Given the repeated swings we've seen, it is difficult to pick out a definite trend, and in fact no statistically significant moderating trend has emerged yet," Lacker told an audience at Frederick Community College. Lacker, who does not have a vote this year on the Fed's interest-rate setting panel, said that the rise in unit labor costs -- a gauge of the labor costs associated with any given unit of production -- had been consistent with the rise in inflation seen recently. He said that if labor costs continued to rise at recent rates, either inflation will keep pace or those costs will be taken out of company profits. However, if profit margins remains high, inflation is unlikely to recede much, the Richmond Fed chief said. "If the markup remains relatively high and unit labor costs continue to advance at or above 2 percent, then we are likely to see inflation continue at about 2 percent," Lacker said. Unit labor costs rose 1.8 percent on an annualized basis in the first three months of this year, revised figures released by the Labor Department showed on Wednesday. Productivity rose at an annualized 1.0 percent in the first quarter. FED SEEN ON HOLD Lacker's comments come three weeks ahead of the Fed's next meeting on interest rates. The central bank is widely expected to hold benchmark overnight borrowing costs steady at 5.25 percent, where they have been since June 2006. Fed officials say keeping borrowing costs at that level is the best way to bring down core inflation, where volatile food and energy costs are stripped out, without tipping the economy into recession. "The central question ... regarding the outlook for inflation is whether core inflation will 'moderate' to an acceptable rate in coming quarters," Lacker said. He said that if investors continue to believe Fed policy-makers are on track to bring inflation down, core inflation should ease to around 2 percent. "As long as policy actions appear to be plausibly consistent with movement toward 2 percent inflation and nothing else acts to alter inflation expectations, that's likely to be the best forecast for where inflation is headed," he said. Any reduction in inflation below 2 percent would be "temporary and hard to sustain" unless there is also a drop in inflation expectations, he added. U.S. stocks slid sharply on Wednesday after the government data showed higher-than-expected unit labor costs and a deceleration in productivity growth in the first quarter, fueling inflation worries. Lacker said the slowdown in productivity growth was to be expected given the economy's weak performance in the first three months of the year. "I'm wary of putting too much pressure, weight, on the last year or two's productivity numbers," he said. However, he said the productivity deceleration was puzzling. "I don't fully understand the productivity slowdown we've seen because business heads ... I talk to have a steady diet planned of technology upgrades and refreshes and it looks like there's plenty of opportunities there to keep driving productivity gains," he added. Lacker said he expects economic growth to be sluggish for the first half of the year but return to trend growth rates by the end of 2007. It is difficult to say whether the downturn in housing markets has reached bottom, Lacker said. But hefty inventories of unsold homes are likely to hold construction spending down for several months to come, he added. Meanwhile, tight job markets are a sign employers are confident economic growth will pick up, Lacker said. "Employment growth has held up quite well and is consistent with a labor market where we're pretty fully utilized in the resources we've got," he said. "There may be some hoarding going on, some labor hoarding. If so, that's an indicator of confidence," he added.
