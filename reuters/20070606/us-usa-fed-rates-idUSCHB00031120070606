 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - A series of stronger-than-expected economic reports has shaken Wall Street's confidence that the Federal Reserve will cut benchmark overnight interest rates in the second half of 2007. 

 A poll of 18 primary dealers on Wednesday showed a median forecast for no change in Fed policy through 2007, starting with the next Federal Open Market Committee on June 28. In a June 1 Reuters survey the median forecast was for a cut in the federal funds rate to 5 percent by year-end from the current 5.25 percent. At this point, though, of the 15 dealers with a directional forecast for Fed rates, 10 still called for the Fed's next move to be a rate cut while only five forecast a hike. For most of the year dealers have braced for the Fed, the U.S. central bank, to cut rates in the second half of 2007, possibly quite aggressively, in anticipation of a significant economic slowdown. But the economy seems to be perking up, and Fed officials have kept up their rhetoric about the need to bring inflation down further with moderately restrictive monetary policy. The Fed, led by Chairman Ben Bernanke, has also played down the potential for a broader spillover to the economy from severe problems in the subprime mortgage sector, where loans are extended to borrowers with spotty credit history. In the past week, the Institute for Supply Management's May reports on the factory and services sectors, respectively, have both outshone Wall Street's expectations. April's durable goods orders and the May non-farm payrolls growth have also been strong. The reports "caused market participants to believe that the economy is returning to trend sooner than what had been expected, thereby mitigating the need for a Fed-engineered return to trend growth via interest rate cuts," said economists at Deutsche Bank. Two high-profile banks, Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch, this week abandoned their calls for lower rates. Each now expects the Fed to stand pat. Goldman's forecast calls for the Fed to hold steady through the end of 2008, although economist Ed McKelvey said the firm "continues to believe that the risks tilt toward easing rather than tightening" over that timeframe. A number of economists have said a meaningful rise in the jobless rate is a prerequisite to rate cuts, because it would give the Fed more confidence that inflation is waning. May's jobless rate was steady at 4.5 percent, low enough to suggest the economy is at or near full employment and that wage inflation could still flare up. "The absence of any tangible evidence of rising unemployment makes it unlikely that Fed officials will cut the funds rate target," Goldman economists said. Barclays Capital is among the firms forecasting rate hikes before year-end as sub-par growth gives way to a smarter-looking economy. "The turnup in growth and improvement in the labor market are playing out as we expect," said economist Dean Maki at Barclays. Still, enough dangers lurk in the economy -- including the still-shaky housing market and the potential for a stock market downturn -- to keep others confident in calls for a rate cut. In short-term interest rate futures, Wednesday's slide in major U.S. stock indexes helped push the implied chances of a Fed ease this year back above 20 percent from as low as 6 percent. Primary dealers are banks and securities brokers designated by the Fed to deal with it in trading U.S. government securities.
