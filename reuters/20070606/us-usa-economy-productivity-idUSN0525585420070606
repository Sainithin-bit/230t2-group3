 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Worker productivity grew at a slower than first estimated 1.0 percent annualized pace during the first quarter as the economy just inched ahead, driving up labor costs by 1.8 percent and backing fears inflation remains a concern, a government report on Wednesday showed. 

 Economists polled ahead of the Labor Department report revised down their forecasts for productivity, expecting non-farm productivity to advance by 1.1 percent and unit labor costs to rise by a bigger 1.2 percent after the government reported scant gross domestic product growth of just 0.6 percent during the first quarter. The Labor Department's earlier estimate for first-quarter productivity showed productivity rising at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.7 percent and unit labor costs increasing 0.6 percent. In Wednesday's report, hourly compensation rose by 2.8 percent in the first quarter, up from the prior quarterly estimate of 2.3 percent.
