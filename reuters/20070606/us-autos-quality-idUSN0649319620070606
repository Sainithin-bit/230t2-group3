 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co. took the top ranking among mass-market automakers in a closely watched annual survey of vehicle quality released on Wednesday, while Toyota Motor Corp.'s flagship brand slipped to sixth place. 

 The J.D. Power and Associates Initial Quality Study also showed strong gains for Ford Motor Co. as the struggling U.S. automaker seeks to build momentum for a turnaround effort that hinges on bringing new buyers into its showrooms. Ford's Lincoln brand claimed the No. 3 spot in the J.D. Power brand rankings, shooting up from No. 12 a year earlier, to trail No. 1 Porsche AG and Toyota's luxury Lexus brand at No. 2. Porsche and Lexus repeated in claiming the top two spots in the quality rankings, which are used heavily in automotive marketing and seen as influential in shaping consumer perceptions. Honda, meanwhile, eclipsed its faster-growing and larger rival Toyota to place as the highest-ranking mainstream brand with strong showings for its Civic sedan and CR-V sport-utility vehicle. Three other brands showed sharp improvements: DaimlerChrsyler AG's Mercedes brand jumped to the No. 5 spot from No. 25, while Saab and Land Rover both also sharply reduced reported vehicle defects, J.D. Power said. FORD RECOVERS GROUND Even after the improvement, however, Ford's Land Rover remained the lowest-ranked brand with an average of 170 reported problems per 100 vehicles, sharply higher than the 91 recorded for industry-leader Porsche. In addition to their marketing value for automakers fighting for a share of a declining U.S. vehicle market, the J.D. Power quality rankings also influence resale values and are read by analysts as a proxy for warranty costs. American automakers, including Ford, have long argued that consumer perception of their quality has lagged real improvements in their engineering and production work. On that question, the J.D. Power report provided some vindication for Ford, which has been overtaken by Toyota as the No. 2 automaker in the U.S. market. A majority of Ford's brands, including Jaguar, Mercury and the namesake Ford brand itself, ranked above industry average, the J.D. Power survey showed. In addition, the Ford brand, which includes the company's best-selling vehicles, rose to the ninth position from 15th spot last year. "Ford had some excellent launches," said Neal Oddes, J.D. Power's director of product research. Oddes cited recently introduced vehicles such as the Ford's Edge crossover and the Lincoln Navigator SUVs as examples of the gains Ford had made in reducing problems in new vehicles, typically the most defect-prone category. "Lincoln Navigator improved dramatically over its predecessor," said Oddes. J.D. Power based its study on responses from 97,000 respondents who bought 2007 model cars and trucks.
