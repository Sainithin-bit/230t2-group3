 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Diversified manufacturer Ingersoll-Rand Co Ltd. ( IR.N ) said on Wednesday that shareholders approved a motion calling for an annual shareholder vote to ratify the pay packages awarded to its top officers. 

 The motion, which the Ingersoll board had recommended shareholders vote against, passed with 54.6 percent of the votes supporting it and 41.7 percent opposing it. The vote was held at Ingersoll's annual meeting in Woodcliff Lake, New Jersey. The company said its next step would be to hold a meeting with its top 20 shareholders, who hold about half its outstanding shares to see how they wanted to proceed. "We recognize that this issue has gained greater attention, particularly as a result of legislative activity in Congress," said Herb Henkel, chairman and chief executive, in a statement. He said the company welcomes "direct communication with shareholders about their specific concerns and suggestions." The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees submitted the proposal. Ingersoll shares were down $1.20, or 2.3 percent, at $50.45 on the New York Stock Exchange.
