 CODY, Wy.  (Reuters) - The U.S. economy will pick up steam this year as inflation fades and current interest rates are not obstructing this recovery, Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank President Thomas Hoenig said on Wednesday. 

 His remarks backed views in financial markets that the U.S. central bank will keep monetary policy on hold in the coming months as it watches how the housing slowdown plays out and whether business investment picks up as expected. "Right now, our policy rate, called the federal funds rate, is at 5-1/4 percent. And in my judgment that is modestly restrictive, not severely, but modestly so," Hoenig told a group of bankers and businessmen in the hometown of Wild Bill Cody and the self-styled rodeo capital of the world. "And that allows for the economy to continue to grow...and slowly, hopefully, bring down the inflation rates for CPI (the consumer price index), the core CPI, to levels even closer to 2 percent as we move forward," Hoenig said. Other Fed policymakers speaking on Wednesday noted that U.S. inflation had been buoyed by soaring energy and commodity prices. These forces should fade, but the U.S. central bank would remain vigilant to make sure they behave as expected. "My Federal Reserve colleagues and I have been clear about our belief that the impact of these influences will dissipate over time," Cleveland Fed President Sandra Pianalto said in a speech in Frankfurt. "But until our beliefs are validated by the data, there is a risk that the public's trust could erode and inflation expectations could move higher," she said. Richmond Federal Reserve President Jeffrey Lacker was also in a hawkish mood when he spoke to an audience in Frederick, Maryland. "No statistically significant moderating trend has emerged yet," said Lacker, referring to core inflation which excludes food and energy. Hoenig said housing would ease as a drag on growth over the year, while business investment seemed to be picking up and earnings from exports had been helped by a weaker dollar and strong growth in the rest of the world. "We are going to see a pretty good bounce back from the first quarter ... and then over the course of this year we'll see the economy more systematically move back toward its long-run potential in the neighborhood of 3 percent," he said. U.S. growth slowed to a mere 0.6 percent annualized pace in the opening 3 months of the year from 2.5 percent in the closing three months of 2006. The interplay between productive economic capacity, with U.S. unemployment rates down at 4.5 percent, and inflation was the key factor in determining this outcome, he said. Government data out earlier on Wednesday revised U.S. first quarter productivity growth down to 1.0 percent from the 1.7 percent initially thought, while unit labor costs were lifted to 1.8 percent from a more modest 0.6 preliminary reading. Hoenig, who is a voting member this year on the Fed's policy-setting committee, said during a question and answer session that he saw this as a temporary blip, reflecting cyclical factors that would fade. "I think you will see those productivity numbers bounce back as the economy itself improves in the second quarter and as we move through the rest of this year. "That will also hopefully, I think, mitigate some of the unit labor cost numbers that we saw as well. And we will see further slowing, slowly ... of the inflation and building of our economy back to the 3 percent of that real GDP number," he said.
