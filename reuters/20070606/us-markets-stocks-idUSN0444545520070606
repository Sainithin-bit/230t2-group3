 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Stocks fell sharply for a second day on Wednesday after data showing higher-than-expected labor costs stoked worries about inflation and interest rates. 

 Energy stocks such as Exxon Mobil Corp. ( XOM.N ) fell and the sector was among the heaviest drags on the S&P 500 after government data showed gasoline stockpiles rose more than analysts had forecast. Rate-sensitive sectors such as utilities and banks also pulled the major indexes lower after an interest-rate hike by the European Central Bank underscored the trend of rising rates. The two-day sell-off in stocks comes just days after the S&P 500 had completed its best two months in nearly four years, leading investors to question whether this could be the start of a long-anticipated pullback. "People are a little skittish," said Chip Hanlon, president of Delta Global Advisors, Inc. in Huntington Beach, California. "The notion that the Fed is not cutting rates, and long- term interest rates going up, is going to send the market down in the short-term -- we've come a long way and it's a good reason for a pullback." The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  slid 129.79 points, or 0.95 percent, to end at 13,465.67.The Dow is now down 226.33 points from its lifetime high of 13,692.00 set during the session on June 1. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  tumbled 13.57 points, or 0.89 percent, to 1,517.38, posting its biggest two-day drop since March. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  skidded 24.05 points, or 0.92 percent, to close at 2,587.18. A government report showed U.S. worker productivity grew more slowly than first estimated in the first quarter, driving up labor costs and reinforcing concerns about inflation. Unit labor costs rose a higher-than-expected 1.8 percent. On the New York Stock Exchange, the drop was broad-based, with decliners outnumbering advancers by a ratio of more than 4 to 1. On Nasdaq the ratio was 2 to 1. BYE BYE, SMALL CAPS The small-cap Russell 2000 index .RUT was down 0.83 percent. The small-company index was lagging major indexes on a year-to-date basis after a long time in the No. 1 spot as investors turned to large-capitalization stocks. Large caps can benefit from their exposure to global markets, which can mean a steadier flow of profits as U.S. economic growth moderates. "Small caps are toast," said Jack Ablin, chief investment strategist at Harris Private Bank in Chicago. "They're expensive, and the earnings expectations are irrational." Investors also kept a close eye on U.S. Treasury bond yields, which continued to hover around 5 percent. The yield of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note US10YT=RR rose to within a whisker of the psychologically important 5 percent level, retreating slightly on Wednesday to 4.97 percent. Higher bond yields raise corporate borrowing costs, and make bonds more competitive with stocks. BAD DAY FOR BUILDERS AND IBM Home-building stocks fell after a leading trade association predicted the pace of U.S. home sales and prices will fall further in 2007 than originally expected. The National Association of Realtors trimmed its sales forecast for the fourth straight month and expanded the speed at which sales prices would drop. The Dow Jones U.S. Home Construction Index .DJUSHB slid 2.3 percent. IBM ( IBM.N ) was the biggest drag on both the Dow and the S&P 500, falling 3.2 percent to $102.41, retreating after an 8.7 percent run higher in the past three months. Traders said the move was due to an index readjustment of IBM's shares, prompting some portfolio managers to sell out of Big Blue's stock. Whole Foods Market Inc.'s stock WFMI.O fell a day after antitrust authorities said they would file a lawsuit to block the organic grocer's takeover of rival Wild Oats Markets Inc. OATS.O. Whole Foods stock fell 3 percent to $39.25, weighing on the Nasdaq. Shares of utility Exelon Corp. ( EXC.N ) tumbled 2.3 percent to $72.60 on the New York Stock Exchange. FPL Group Inc. FPL.N lost 1.6 percent to $59.93 despite Citigroup's increase in its price target on the stock. The S&P utilities index .GSPU fell 1.4 percent. Shares of investment bank Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) lost 0.9 percent to $227.35, while the stock of rival JPMorgan Chase & Co. ( JPM.N ) slid 1.3 percent to $50.56. Exxon Mobil's shares fell 0.8 percent to $83.62. Trading was moderate on the NYSE, with about 1.55 billion shares changing hands, below last year's estimated daily average of 1.84 billion. On the Nasdaq, about 2.16 billion shares traded, above last year's daily average of 2.02 billion.
