 MUMBAI  (Reuters) - There are some signs of cyclical overheating in India's economy, but the recent rise in the rupee has dampened inflation, a government economic adviser said on Wednesday. 

 India also needed to be very careful about trying to moderate the large capital inflows into the economy, although some types could be discouraged, C. Rangarajan, who heads the prime minister's economic advisory panel, told reporters at a financial conference. "Cyclical overheating in an economy occurs when the existing capacities are being fully utilized and demand pressures are still there. Yes there is, to some extent, cyclical overheating," he said India, Asia's third-largest economy, has grown at an average of 8.6 percent over the past 4 fiscal years. That has put pressure on the country's inadequate infrastructure, and added to inflationary pressures in the economy. The central bank has raised rates five times since last June and increased banks' reserve requirements three times since December to rein in inflation and credit growth. Annual wholesale inflation hit 6.7 percent in late January, its highest in more than 2 years, and has since moderated to 5.06 percent in mid-May. Rangarajan said the rise in the rupee  -- it hit a nine-year high against the dollar last week -- had helped dampen inflation, but the big capital inflows that had powered its rise had complicated monetary policy and currency management. "Capital flows far exceed our current account deficit. We have to be very careful about how to moderate capital flows. We should not send out wrong signals, but at the same time some kinds of capital inflows could be discouraged," he said.
