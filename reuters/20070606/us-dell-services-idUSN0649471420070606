 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Dell Inc. DELL.O will use partnerships and acquisitions to become more services-oriented, the Financial Times reported in its online edition on Wednesday, citing an interview with Chief Executive Michael Dell. 

 Dell's services business is growing faster than sales of computer equipment and represents a "huge opportunity," CEO Dell told the FT. "I think you will see some more acquisitions to add capability to our services team," he said. Dell did not immediately return a call seeking comment. Michael Dell has previously stated that the company was looking to make acquisitions to bolster its $6 billion services unit, which provides customer support and technical assistance. Dell is known for a direct sales business model that cuts out middlemen and allows the company to deal directly with customers. Dell, which for three years had been the world's top seller of personal computers, last year lost that ranking to Hewlett-Packard Co. ( HPQ.N ) as HP Chief Executive Mark Hurd cut prices and boosted sales of consumer PCs. Dell gets about 85 percent of its revenue from corporate customers, a slower-growing segment than individuals.
