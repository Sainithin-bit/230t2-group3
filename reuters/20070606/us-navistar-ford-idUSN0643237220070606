 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Navistar International Corp. NAVZ.PK said on Wednesday it filed a lawsuit against Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) for breaching a diesel engine contract covering F-150 pickup trucks, marking an escalation of a legal battle between the two. 

 The Illinois-based truck and engine maker said the suit, filed in Cook County, Illinois, seeks "at least hundreds of millions of dollars" in damages. Navistar, the exclusive supplier of diesel engines to Ford's Super Duty pickups since 1979, said Ford plans to develop a new diesel engine designed by International Truck and Engine Corp., Navistar's principal operating company. According to the lawsuit, Ford is planning to make a 4.4 liter diesel engine for the F-150 by late 2009 or 2010 and that would violate the automaker's contract with Navistar. The lawsuit says International spent millions of dollars to develop a next-generation diesel engine for vehicles, including the F-150 pickups, for which Ford previously had not offered diesel engines. Navistar said Ford had agreed International would make the new engines for Ford in North America. Ford was not immediately available for comment. The lawsuit is the latest twist in a contract dispute that began in January, when Ford sued Navistar over warranty costs and engine prices related to the contract for the F-Series, the most popular vehicles in their class. That prompted Navistar to briefly cut off diesel engine shipments to Ford, although a judge later ordered the company to resume shipments while the case proceeds. Navistar also said the lawsuit, filed on June 4, is separate from previous litigation. The two in March agreed to try to resolve the contract dispute and also agreed to a court order that required Navistar to continue to ship the engines and Ford to keep paying for the engines without deductions. Navistar's brief halt of diesel engine shipments threatened to disrupt production of the Super Duty, one of Ford's most profitable vehicles, and a key launch this year as Ford tries to recover after losing more than $12 billion in 2006.
