 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - CVS Caremark Corp. ( CVS.N ) on Wednesday said its contract to provide retail pharmacy and clinical benefit services for Blue Cross and Blue Shield's federal employee program was extended for three years through 2010. 

 Beginning in 2008, however, Blue Cross and Blue Shield elected to outsource the mail fulfillment portion of the program to a third party. FEP currently covers about 4.7 million federal employees, CVS Caremark said. "We remain confident that we will achieve significant earnings growth in 2008 even without FEP's mail service program," CVS Caremark Chief Executive Tom Ryan said in a statement. In a statement, CVS Caremark said the retail and clinical portion of the program generates about $4 billion of revenue each year. Caremark has been administering FEP's retail pharmacy benefit program since 1993. The current contract to administer the mail fulfillment part of the program will last through the end of 2007. Drugstore chain CVS bought Caremark, a pharmaceutical services company, earlier this year. Ryan said he was "disappointed in the decision to outsource the mail fulfillment." CVS Caremark shares fell 0.7 percent to $37 in after-hours trading after closing at $37.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.
