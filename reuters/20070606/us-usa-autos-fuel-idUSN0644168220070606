 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Chief executives of U.S.- based automakers were told bluntly by Democratic leaders on Wednesday to expect higher fuel standards, but the industry lobbied hard to avoid sharply higher mileage targets. 

 Rick Wagoner of General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ), Alan Mulally of Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) and Tom LaSorda of Chrysler Group DCX.N met key House of Representatives and Senate leaders to discuss how changes in trade, health care and especially energy policy would affect their businesses. It was their first face-to-face meeting with congressional leaders and key players in the energy debate since the Senate Commerce Committee passed legislation last month to mandate a 4 percent annual increase in fuel economy beginning in 2011. Legislative proponents on Capitol Hill and environmentalists agree that making cars go much further on a gallon of gasoline is the quickest and most effective way to lower energy consumption and reduce oil imports. Under current rules, light trucks, the bread and butter of domestic manufacturers, must achieve 24 mpg by 2011. There are no changes planned for sedans, compacts and wagons, which have had to achieve 27.5 mpg for the past 17 years. Auto manufacturers fiercely oppose the Senate plan, saying it would cost them billions and further erode their competitive position at a time when they can least afford it. "We are willing to participate and continue to improve fuel economy," said Wagoner in comments to reporters after a Democratic-sponsored summit on the state of U.S. manufacturing. But Wagoner, speaking for his Ford and Chrysler colleagues, said it is time for government to move beyond Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) as the primary tool for achieving fuel savings. He noted the 30-year-old program has failed to meet expectations. "It has become increasingly clear that, of anything we can do over the next decade, bio-fuels have by far the greatest potential to actually reduce U.S. oil consumption, reduce oil imports and reduce carbon gas emissions," Wagoner said. Nevertheless, lawmakers, including Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, said making automakers produce cars that go further on a gallon of gasoline was crucial. "We need to have CAFE standards," Reid told the Detroit- executives in remarks at the summit. "Whether it's enough, we'll find out." Other Democrats at the summit, where Republicans were not invited, were much more strident in their criticism of Detroit's failure to make more efficient vehicles. "I think your position is yesterday forever," said Sen. Byron Dorgan of North Dakota. Many Senate lawmakers have coalesced around the Commerce proposal, which would make vehicles average 35 miles per gallon by 2020. Debate by the full Senate could start as early as next week. Some Capitol Hill allies of the Detroit automakers are trying to gain support for a substitute Senate plan that would lower the mileage target -- 32 mpg -- and push out the time frame by several years. The plan would also offer incentives for development of gasoline alternatives. Democratic Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan said the substitute mileage targets may not be palatable to Detroit. But, he agreed that research and development of alternative fuels was crucial to energy security. "We hope this is responsible," Levin said of any mileage increase approved by Congress. The House is working on a separate proposal that would raise mileage targets to 36 mpg for cars and 30 mpg for light trucks more than 15 years down the road. That proposal would also block states from imposing their own limits on carbon emissions.
