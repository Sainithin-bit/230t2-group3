 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - ADC Telecommunications Inc. ADCT.O posted a sharp increase in quarterly profit on Wednesday, beating expectations, and gave a forecast that topped current estimates, sending shares 3 percent higher. 

 Second-quarter sales and earnings were "stronger than expected," Chief Executive Robert Switz said in a statement, noting it boosted profitability through gains in manufacturing efficiencies, while cutting total operating expenses. Net income from continuing operations jumped to $96.5 million, or 73 cents per share, for its fiscal second quarter ended May 4, from $25.1 million, or 21 cents per share, a year ago. Net sales fell to $349.4 million from $358.1 million, while analysts expected $333 million, on average, based on Reuters Estimates. Earnings were 35 cents per share, excluding a gain from the sale of stock and restructuring and acquisition charges and stock compensation expenses, versus the average analyst estimate of 23 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. For its full fiscal year, ADC sees net income from continuing operations of $1.06 per share to $1.11 per share, on revenue of $1.28 billion to $1.29 billion. Analysts currently expect a per-share profit of 86 cents on revenue of $1.29 billion. ADC Telecommunications expects results in the second half of fiscal 2007 to be "relatively flat to down modestly" from a year ago. At the same time, it does "not expect that the quarterly pattern of results in fiscal 2007 will fluctuate as sharply as in fiscal 2006." Shares of ADC Telecommunications rose 19 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $17.29 on Nasdaq. In extended trade, the stock climbed to $17.95.
