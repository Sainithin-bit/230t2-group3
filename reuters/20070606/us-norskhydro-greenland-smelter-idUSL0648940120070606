 OSLO  (Reuters) - Norwegian industrial group Norsk Hydro ( NHY.OL ) acknowledged on Wednesday it had lost out to U.S. rival Alcoa ( AA.N ) to build a large aluminum smelter and related hydropower capacity in Greenland. 

 Norwegian national broadcaster NRK said the roughly $3 billion project would be the biggest industrial development in Greenland ever and would be about twice the north Atlantic island nation's gross domestic product. "Greenland could have been an interesting opportunity," Norsk Hydro's spokesman for its aluminum business Thomas Knutzen told NRK. Knutzen said Greenland would have been an interesting location to produce aluminum because it could have supplied the key North American and European markets from a relatively short distance. Alcoa had said last month that it had signed a memorandum of understanding with Greenland's Home Rule Cabinet to carry out a feasibility study to build a 340,000-tonnes-per-year smelter, a hydropower system and related infrastructure. "If the viability of the project is proved, ground breaking for the hydroelectric power system would be expected in 2010, and for the smelter in 2012," Alcoa said in a May 23 statement. "The smelter could then commence operation by the end of 2014." That statement signaled that Greenland had chosen to continue cooperating with Alcoa rather than Norsk Hydro. Norsk Hydro, which is selling its oil and gas business to Norway's Statoil ( STL.OL ) in a $30 billion deal to become a focused aluminum company, has sought expansion opportunities around the world in locations where cheap energy is available. Hydro had said in January that it had agreed with Greenland's home rule government to study the feasibility of building an aluminum plant with annual capacity of up to 300,000 tonnes and power generation capacity of 500 megawatts. Norsk Hydro has been mentioned as a possible counterbidder for Canadian aluminum Alcan AL.TO after Alcoa last month launched an unsolicited $28 billion offer for the company to create a giant aluminum producer.
