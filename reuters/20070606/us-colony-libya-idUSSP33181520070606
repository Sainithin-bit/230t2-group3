 LONDON/NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Private investment firm Colony Capital LLC has agreed to buy a controlling stake in Libyan state-owned Tamoil in a deal that valued the Italy-based refiner at 4 billion euros ($5.4 billion) -- double earlier estimates. 

 Los Angeles-based Colony said in a statement on Wednesday that the sale also included Tamoil holding company Oilinvest and that the Libyan government would retain a 35 percent stake in the ongoing group. The statement did not say what price Colony paid for its stake and a spokesman declined to give further detail. The conclusion of a sale process that even bidders found opaque represents the second major foray by private equity into the European refining sector in recent years, as oil majors like BP Plc ( BP.L ) and Exxon Mobil ( XOM.N ) exit the industry. In 2005, funds managed by Carlyle Group CYL.UL and Riverstone Holdings bought Dutch-based Petroplus PPHN.S and last year floated the independent refiner in Switzerland, making a substantial profit. Some industry players and bankers had expected an Italian refiner to buy Tamoil, tipping ERG ( ERG.MI ) in particular. However, ERG said in late March it was not even sure if the Libyans still wanted to sell. Dario Scaffardi, general manager of rival Italian refiner Saras said on Wednesday that his company had also looked at Tamoil but decided not to bid. Saras valued Tamoil at around 2 billion euros -- a level analysts believed reflected current industry valuations. Tamoil owns and operates more than 3,000 service stations in Europe, concentrated in Italy, and has oil refineries in Italy, Switzerland, Spain and Germany, Colony said. Colony, founded in 1991 by Thomas Barrack, focuses on real estate-related assets, securities, and operating companies. Earlier this year, it bought a stake in French retailer Carrefour ( CARR.PA ) with French billionaire Bernard Arnault, and it joined the founding family of Station Casinos Inc. ( STN.N ) in a $5.5 billion bid to take the gaming company private. Scaffardi said the high sale price could boost expectations among the sellers of northern Italian refiner IES. Saras is one of the shortlisted bidders for IES, which operates a 57,000 barrel per day refiner.
