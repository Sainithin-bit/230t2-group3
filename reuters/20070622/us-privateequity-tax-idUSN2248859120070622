 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives introduced a bill on Friday that would more than double taxes on the pay of managers of private equity funds, hedge funds and other investment partnerships. 

 Throwing down a challenge to some of the nation's savviest and richest financiers, the bill would set a higher tax rate for "carried interest." That is the 20-percent cut of profits beyond targeted returns typically kept by senior managers of private equity firms and other firms on major transactions. The bill, introduced with the backing of two senior Democratic committee chairmen, ratcheted up a confrontation between Congress and the booming private equity sector, a driving force behind a global surge in corporate buyouts. Under present law, carried interest is taxed at the 15-percent capital gains tax rate, not the income tax rate of up to  35 percent. The low tax rate makes carried interest a key source of vast fortunes for private equity's top ranks. "Congress must ensure that our tax code is fair," said Michigan Democrat Sander Levin, one of the 14 lawmakers who introduced the bill. "We have to be sure that the lower capital gains tax rate is not being inappropriately substituted for the tax rate on wages and earnings," Levin said in a statement. Joining Levin in introducing the bill were Ways and Means Committee Chairman Charles Rangel of New York, and Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank of Massachusetts. The Private Equity Council, a lobbying group for the industry, criticized the bill. "The net effect of this legislation would be to substantially undermine the private equity industry, which has strengthened and made more competitive hundreds of companies and returned more than $430 billion in profits to pension funds, endowments, foundations and other investors," it said. The private equity sector came into sharp focus this week with Thursday's $4.13-billion initial public offering of Blackstone Group LP. The IPO debuted amid pleas for a delay by some lawmakers and the introduction of a Senate bill to raise taxes on private equity firms that go public. Shares of Blackstone, the largest private equity firm to float, began trading on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange. They closed up 13 percent at $35.06. The Senate Finance Committee is also studying carried interest taxation. Sen. Jim Webb said he was disappointed that federal regulators did not move to delay the Blackstone IPO as he requested on Wednesday. In a letter to regulators, the Virginia Democrat said he is concerned about national security concerns posed by Blackstone's deal last month to sell a $3 billion stake to the Chinese government. "Blackstone Group owns companies that provide software and applications for use by the military and in satellite technology," Webb wrote in his latest letter. Under the House Democrats' tax bill, Levin said, the managers of investment partnerships who receive a carried interest as compensation will pay regular income tax rates rather than capital gains rates on that compensation. "The capital gains rate will continue to apply to the extent that the managers' income represents a reasonable return on capital they have actually invested in the partnership," Levin said. Rangel's tax-writing Ways and Means Committee plans to hold hearings after the July 4 congressional recess on taxation of private equity firms and related issues. Citing concerns about the Blackstone IPO, Senate Finance Committee leaders last week introduced a bill they say would close a loophole that allows private equity firms to float as publicly traded partnerships without paying corporation taxes. The bill was co-authored by Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus and senior Republican Charles Grassley. It would require publicly traded partnerships deriving income from investment adviser and asset management services to pay the corporation tax rate instead of the capital gains rate. In Britain, taxes are part of a wide-ranging investigation of private equity that is also looking into leverage and secrecy. Private equity firms borrow against pools of money from large institutional investors to buy control of companies, shape them up and then sell them on for a profit. The firms last year raised $430 billion globally. Prime Minister Tony Blair told Parliament this week that "real issues" over the level of tax paid by private equity firms had been raised "right across the political spectrum."
