 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Deutsche Boerse's DB1Gbn.DE focus is on organic growth, cost discipline and capital management, the German stock exchange operator said on Friday, staying silent on the takeover situation at Borsa Italiana. 

 Presentation slides prepared for Boerse's investor day and posted on the company's Web site made no mention of the Italian stock exchange. The London Stock Exchange ( LSE.L ) has said it is in merger discussions with Borsa Italiana, and NYSE Euronext NYX.N NYX.PA has also submitted a preliminary bid, according to the Wall Street Journal. Some analysts have said that Boerse may want to join the fray while industry sources have said such a move from Frankfurt is unlikely, partly due to opposition from some shareholders to its recent agreed takeover of U.S. options market International Securities Exchange (ISE) ISE.N. "At the moment, the only offer under discussion is the one from the LSE," a Borsa spokeswoman told Reuters on Friday. Borsa said after Thursday's meeting ended there were no other offers. The only reference to exchange industry consolidation in Boerse's investor day group strategy slides was its intention to complete the $2.8 billion ISE transaction and integrate ISE. The investor day is closed to the media. "Our focus is on organic growth, cost discipline and capital management," Boerse said. Its shares eased 0.6 percent to 84.36 euros by 0938 GMT. NYSE Euronext shares were down 0.2 percent while LSE's shares were up 1.5 percent. SHARE BUY-BACK Boerse reiterated its expectation to be able to resume share buybacks in the second half of 2008 and its outlook for another record result in 2007. Under a two-year capital management program launched in May 2005, Boerse has returned some 1.9 billion euros ($2.55 billion) to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. Infuriating some shareholders, it put the program on hold due to the need to finance the ISE acquisition, but said in Friday's slides: "Share buy-backs are only temporarily suspended ... (and) expected to resume in the second half of 2008." Boerse reported record sales and earnings in the first quarter and said in its investor day slides that the "promising start to full-year 2007 strengthens our expectations for another record year". Growing trading volumes for both cash equities and derivatives have prompted analysts to upgrade their expectations for Boerse's 2007 revenues to on average 2.06 billion euros from 2.01 billion euros at the start of the year, according to Reuters EcoWin. Full-year 2007 earnings per share (EPS) forecasts have risen to 3.89 euros now from 3.61 euros at the start of 2007. In 2006, Boerse's revenues were 1.85 billion euros and EPS 3.36 euros. The 2007 mean net profit forecast for Boerse, according to Reuters Estimates, suggests an increase of 17.4 percent year-on-year compared with a projected net profit rise of 19.6 percent for LSE. ** For related story "NYSE Euronext rivals LSE for Italy bourse-report" please double click on <ID:nL2234978>.
