 NAGOYA, Japan  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp. ( 7203.T ) is bullish on the U.S. market and will keep adding manufacturing capacity in the region as demand grows, a top executive said, shooting down a newspaper report that the automaker was changing course to slow down expansion there. 

 The Wall Street Journal reported this week that Japan's top automaker would intentionally scale back new plant construction in North America in a shift of strategy to save costs and avoid the risk of overcapacity. Toyota was also mindful of the bigger profits it could reap by exporting from Japan in light of the soft yen, the paper said. Over the last few years, Toyota has been adding car factories in North America at a pace of about one a year to meet a spike in demand for its fuel-efficient fleet of cars and to conquer segments in which it has a small presence. It is also trying to reduce imports from Japan to preempt a political backlash amid the yen's persistent weakness and the company's ever-growing share of the U.S. market that has helped it topple General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) as the world's biggest automaker. Between a factory in Texas that began building the Tundra pickup truck last November and its eighth North American car plant slated for a 2010 start in Mississippi, Toyota is adding 600,000 units of annual output capacity in the region. "That is pretty good evidence of our confidence in the market, and we will continue to build our vehicles where we sell them," Jim Press, president of Toyota Motor North America, told a small group of reporters. "There has been no change in our plans for our growth strategy," he added, dismissing the report as "idle speculation". Despite widespread worries about the U.S. economy, weak vehicle sales and increasing competition, Press said the United States remained one of the world's most dynamic auto markets due partly to its booming youth and immigrant populations. "In America we have more cars per household than drivers. It's a great country to be in the car business," he said. "So the outlook in my mind is very positive for continued growth. And as that ocean rises, all the boats will rise with it." After falling 2.2 percent last year, total U.S. vehicle sales are down 2 percent in the first five months of 2007. But Press, who on Friday became Toyota's first non-Japanese board member upon his promotion to senior managing director, characterized the sales results so far as solid in view of a decline in profit-eroding incentives and less-profitable sales to fleet customers. The sales fall has largely been limited to Detroit's GM, Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) and Chrysler DCXGn.DE, with Toyota clocking a 7.6 percent rise in adjusted sales in the year to date. YEN NOT AN ISSUE Press stopped short of discussing specific expansion plans beyond 2010 in North America, saying Toyota would first need to absorb the planned increase in capacity. "We want to digest the 600,000 units and get it up and running ... before we start speculating on what's next." But Press, a 37-year veteran at Toyota, stressed the automaker remained committed to building cars locally, regardless of what currency rates did. Citing unnamed senior executives and board members, the Wall Street Journal said former presidents Hiroshi Okuda and Shoichiro Toyoda -- two influential members of Toyota's board -- had inquired during discussions over the planned $1.3 billion factory in Mississippi whether it would make more sense to export cars from Japan instead, given the favorable yen rate. "I think executives at Toyota know that currencies move both ways," Press said. "We don't make decisions based on the currencies of where we build plants." Press, a competitive swimmer and a licensed pilot, said Toyota was in fact placing more importance than ever on the North American market -- one sign of which was his election to the board of directors. "For me, it's a recognition of the great job that the North American people have done," he said. "It also shows the importance Toyota is placing on the North American market and recognizing that we need to improve the level of communication and the flow of information from the local market into headquarters as decisions are made."
