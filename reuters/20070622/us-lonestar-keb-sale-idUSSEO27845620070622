 SEOUL  (Reuters) - U.S. private equity house Lone Star said on Friday it sold a stake in Korea Exchange Bank as well as two domestic firms for a total of $2.3 billion, speeding up disposals of controversial South Korean investments. 

 The Dallas-based fund has faced public outcry over the size of expected profits from its deals in South Korea, which some have described as a litmus test of how far the country is willing to accept foreign investment. Lone Star Chairman John Grayken said the fund had sold a 13.6 percent stake in key investment Korea Exchange Bank (KEB) to pay down debt, and added it plans to sell its remaining 51 percent in South Korea's fifth-biggest lender to a strategic investor. "We are actively looking for a strategic investor who can take KEB to the next level," Grayken said in a statement. "Lone Star is still committed to South Korea and retains several other significant assets in the country," the fund said in a separate statement. Lone Star's LS.UL sale of KEB 004940.KS shares came after it scrapped a $7.3 billion deal last year to sell the lender to Kookmin Bank 060000.KS amid a legal dispute with regulators over its $1.2 billion purchase of a majority of KEB in 2003. The fund said it sold 87.7 million shares in KEB at 13,600 won each -- a 6.8 percent discount to Thursday's s closing share price -- to raise 1.2 trillion won ($1.3 billion), confirming information a source had earlier provided to Reuters. Merrill Lynch estimates that Lone Star paid 4,245 won per share when it bought KEB in 2003, less than a third the price at which it sold the shares overnight. The offer was expanded from an earlier planned 73.1 million shares, as the sale was five times covered, the source said. Analysts said that by cutting back its stake, Lone Star may be acknowledging that selling all of KEB may take longer than expected and is seeking profits from its investment, making it likely the fund will continue extracting dividends from KEB. KEB paid the private equity firm $444.5 million earlier this year -- its first dividend in a decade. "We still believe that the sale of KEB will take place in 2008 as the court proceedings are likely to drag on," JPMorgan analysts said in a note to clients on Friday. Shares in KEB closed down 3.42 percent at 14,100 won, compared with a 1.3 percent fall in the main KOSPI  .KS11 . Credit Suisse ( CSGN.VX ) was the sole bookrunner for the deal. Besides KEB, Lone Star is cashing in on some of its other investments in South Korea, selling 98 percent of builder Kukdong Engineering and Construction on Friday to a local business group for $712 million. The sale of Kukdong to Woongjin Holdings Co. Ltd. ( 016880.KS ) fetched around $300 million-$400 million more than local media had projected. Lone Star also announced separately it had sold local leasing firm STARLease to Hyosung Corp. ( 004800.KS ) for $326 million, up from expectations of around $200 million. ABN AMRO AAH.AS advised Lone Star on both deals. LOOKING AHEAD Among Lone Star's holdings, KEB has sparked the most interest as it is considered one of the few remaining targets for foreign investors seeking growth in South Korea's banking sector. But analysts say local lenders such as Kookmin and Hana Financial Group ( 086790.KS ) will likely move only after the legal issues surrounding the bank are cleared by the Supreme Court. Prosecutors said in December that the KEB sale to Lone Star was illegal, accusing the fund of colluding with the lender's management to pay less for a controlling stake than it was worth. Lone Star has denied any wrongdoing in the transaction and said it was being unfairly targeted by prosecutors. Hana Financial, one of the bidders for KEB in 2006, said on Friday it had participated in the overnight block trade to buy KEB shares, bidding for less than a 1 percent stake. Neither Singapore's DBS Group Holdings ( DBSM.SI ), which pulled out of buyout talks for KEB earlier this month, nor Kookmin subscribed to KEB shares. KEB shares are up 9.7 percent this year as of Friday's close, less than the benchmark KOSPI's  .KS11  23.5 percent gain. ($1=927.2 Won)
