 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wendy's International Inc. WEN.N said on Friday that it will roll out its new breakfast menu to more than 75 additional restaurants this month and expects to offer breakfast in more than 650 restaurants by the end of August. 

 The hamburger chain, seeking to boost sales, had been testing the breakfast menu in about 160 restaurants in five markets and said the move marks the first expansion beyond those test markets. Last year, Wendy's said it would add a breakfast menu as part of a wider plan to revive profits in the face of stiff competition from McDonald's Corp. ( MCD.N ) and Burger King Holdings Inc. BKC.N. It said that if breakfast was introduced nationwide, it could add between $75 million and $95 million to annual operating profit. Earlier this week, the company cut its 2007 earnings forecast and said it would explore a sale of the company instead of restructuring options. Wendy's shares were up 39 cents, or 1 percent, at $36.95 in late morning New York Stock Exchange trading. McDonald's shares were down 91 cents, or almost 2 percent, at $50.16, while Burger King shares declined 31 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $25.71. (Reporting by  Nicole Maestri )
