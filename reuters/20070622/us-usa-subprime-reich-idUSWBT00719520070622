 VIENNA, Virginia  (Reuters) - The head of the U.S. Office of Thrift Supervision told Reuters on Friday that federal regulators will issue by the end of next week a final version of subprime lending standards for borrowers with weak credit. 

 "I think it will be very similar to the (original) proposal," OTS Director John Reich said. "I think the final statement certainly will reflect a high percentage of the original statement." Reich spoke on the sidelines of an anti-money laundering event at the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network headquarters in suburban Washington. (Reporting by  John Poirier )
