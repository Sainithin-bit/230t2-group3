 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Hasbro Inc. HAS.N is banking on its "Transformers" product license being golden enough to sell a $495 transforming jacket, and Mattel Inc. MAT.N disclosed plans for girls to tee it up with Barbie golf clubs this week at the 2007 International Licensing Show in New York. 

 Meanwhile, video game maker Nintendo Co. 7974.OS hopes the Super Mario Brothers franchise still carries enough cache from its 1980s heyday to sell sneakers and candy. And NASCAR looks to have its fans buzzing with bottled wine bearing its name, which stands for the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing. More than 23,000 retailers, brand owners and manufactures invaded the Jacob K. Javits Center in search of the next big thing in an event tailor-made for deal closings that will bring licensed product to market in 2008 and beyond. And to ensure their brands are properly represented, intellectual property owners often make sure they have full autonomy over any product bearing their name. According the International Licensing Industry Merchandisers Association, 86 percent of all licensing deals this year were initiated at the 3-day event. During the show, Warner Bros. named Mattel as the master toy licensee for potential 2008 summer movie blockbusters "The Dark Knight," the next chapter in the "Batman" saga; and "Speed Racer," the latest film by Larry and Andy Wachowski in their first directorial outing since completing the "Matrix" trilogy in 2003. But as the dealings heated up, analysts couldn't stop gushing about three of 2007's hottest properties, all based on films or TV shows. These include "Transformers," a DreamWorks/Paramount movie which opens in U.S. theaters on July 3, based on the popular 1980s TV cartoon about warring robots that transform into vehicles. The other shows are Walt Disney Co.'s ( DIS.N ) "Hannah Montana," about a teenage girl living a double life as an average student and pop singer; and "High School Musical," a television musical about overachieving high schoolers. "You see the power of Disney," said independent toy industry consultant Christopher Byrne. "They're doing a brilliant strategic job. You can do worse than having your kids emulate 'High School Musical.'" Jim Silver, editor-in-chief of Toy Wishes magazine, said products bearing the Hannah Montana name should be hot sellers as well. And while Hannah's hot, Transformers is simply scorching, Silver added. "Transformers product is blowing out of the stores. It's the hottest thing at retail today." A CHANGING GLOBAL VISION While brand holders have long cast their eye on doing business globally, the growth of markets like Latin America, India and China have many companies changing the way they do business overseas. Rather than creating a concept with an American audience in mind first and then figuring out how to take it abroad, brand holders are thinking globally from the ground up. "Dora the Explorer" is an example of this new line of thinking, said Leigh Anne Brodsky, Nickelodeon's president of consumer products. "Dora" is a popular show on Nickelodeon, a unit of Viacom Inc. VIA.N, based on a 7-year-old Latina girl who solves problems and uses both Spanish and English to communicate with friends. The character has exploded across the world because she corresponds to every country she's in, Brodsky said. In Japan for example, she's Japanese and speaks both English and Japanese. "It's less foreign now," Brodsky said of the licensing business. "My whole planning team, we now think globally. It's not an after-thought anymore."
