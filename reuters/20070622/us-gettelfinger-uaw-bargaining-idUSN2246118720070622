 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - United Auto Workers President Ron Gettelfinger and Vice President Cal Rapson said on Friday that a strike is one possible option during the upcoming national negotiations with U.S.-based automakers. 

 Gettelfinger and Rapson gave the one word response "yes" to a questioner asking whether striking was an option during an online chat with UAW members. The union begins contract talks with General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ), Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) and Chrysler Group, which DaimlerChrysler AG DCX.NDCXGn.DE AG is selling this summer.
