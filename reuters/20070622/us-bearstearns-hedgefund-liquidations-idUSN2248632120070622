 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bear Stearns Cos. Inc. BSC.N said on Friday it is confident that the value of the collateral for its up to $3.2 billion loan to a hedge fund is greater than the value of the loan. 

 That means the investment bank's exposure to the fund that it manages, the Bear Stearns High-Grade Structured Credit Fund, is relatively low. Bear Stearns is still trying to restructure the Bear Stearns High Grade Structured Credit Enhanced Leveraged Fund, and that could take several months, said Bear Chief Financial Officer Sam Molinaro. But so far, all parties that have threatened to sell assets seized from the fund have not done so, Molinaro said. There are not additional Bear Stearns managed funds with similar market exposure, he added.
