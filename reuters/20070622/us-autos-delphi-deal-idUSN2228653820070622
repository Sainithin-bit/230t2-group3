 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) and bankrupt parts supplier Delphi Corp. DPHIQ.PK are ready to announce a labor deal with the United Auto Workers union on Friday, a person involved in the negotiations said. 

 UAW officials met with presidents of union chapters on Friday in Detroit to brief the local union presidents on progress toward a settlement of the long-running talks. The person involved in the negotiations attended that meeting and said an announcement would come Friday. A tentative deal between GM, Delphi and the UAW would clear a major hurdle for the parts supplier to emerge from bankruptcy and remove a major operational risk for GM.
