 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Investor Carl Icahn on Friday said he has no plans to raise his $36-per-share offer for auto parts maker Lear Corp. ( LEA.N ), saying the price is "fair." 

 "I think it's a very fair bid and we have no intention of raising it," said Icahn in an interview. "Let the shareholders decide. We're paying double what the price was back in September. And the risks are certainly still there." Icahn's offer for Lear has faced criticism from some shareholders who have said the price was too low. Lear shares were recently trading unchanged at $36.45 on the New York Stock Exchange.
