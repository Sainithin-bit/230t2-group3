 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Financing for leveraged buyouts turned more precarious on Friday as Thomson Learning was forced to retool terms on $5.3 billion of loans and bonds after meeting resistance from investors. 

 The financing package, part of a record debt-raising spree by takeover firms, was sweetened with stricter terms on both the loans and bonds after being downsized earlier this week, market sources said. Thomson Learning is selling debt to pay for its buyout from Thomson Corp. TOC.TO by private equity investors Apax Partners and OMERS Capital Partners. The debt sale has struggled for days amid concerns that the company is taking on too much leverage, while a downturn in the high-yield market added to investor jitters, strategists said. "The structure was built for a strong market," said Charles Ullerich, high-yield portfolio manager for ABN Amro in Chicago. "We don't have a strong market, so the bondholders are going to push back." Concerns about the bond sale also centered on its "pay-in-kind" notes, which would allow the issuer to pay interest in added notes instead of cash. MARKET CONDITIONS WORSEN If a company has to exercise that feature, "it's a declaration they don't have the cash flow to service their debt," said Kingman Penniman, president of high-yield research firm KDP Investment Advisors. In response to investor concerns, Thomson on Thursday eliminated a $540 million "pay-in-kind" floating rate note from the bond sale, trimming its total size to $1.6 billion from $2.14 billion. A spokesman for Thomson Learning could not be reached for comment. The deal underwent more revisions on Friday. The loan portion was sweetened with covenants that restrict senior secured debt to no more than 8.25 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, according to Reuters Loan Pricing Corp. Covenants were also added to the bond sale, according to  KDP. Financial markets have been skittish as Wall Street banks unwound positions this week in two Bear Stearns Cos. BSC.N hedge funds heavily invested in subprime home loans, fueling concerns that other investment banks may face losses. In the high-yield market, the subprime fears added to losses from earlier this month when inflation worries sparked concerns of global interest rate increases. LOSING MONTH FOR JUNK BONDS "It's the liquidity that has made the high-yield market and equity market strong since June of last year, so what happens if some of that global liquidity starts to dissipate?" said KDP's Penniman. Month-to-date, junk bonds have posted a loss of 1.33 percent, the worst performance of any major class of U.S. bonds, according to Merrill Lynch data. With the markets weaker, bond investors are able to push back against terms that were accommodated in stronger markets, Penniman said. Ahold's ( AHLN.AS ) U.S. Foodservice also trimmed a bond sale on Friday to $1.1 billion from $1.55 billion and revised the structure to provide more cash-pay notes, according to KDP. Bear Stearns has estimated that funding needs for leveraged buyouts total about $301 billion, including about $89 billion of bonds and $212 billion of loans. Issuers have been trying to get many bond deals completed before the July 4th Independence Day holiday, when the market tends to slow for the summer, said KDP's market analyst Justin Monteith. "It seems like everyone is going to push back on all of these deals," Monteith said. Thomson Corp. announced in May that it was selling its education assets for about $7.75 billion to pursue other opportunities. The Canadian publisher has agreed to buy London-based Reuters Group Plc RTR.L RTRSY.O for about $17.2 billion.
