 MILAN/NEW YORK  (Reuters) - NYSE Euronext Inc. NYX.N NYX.PA, one of the world's biggest stock market operators, has stepped into the bidding for Italy's bourse, the Wall Street Journal said, squaring up against the London Stock Exchange. 

 NYSE Euronext's preliminary offer is around 1.5 billion euros ($2.01 billion), the Journal said in its online edition, quoting people familiar with the matter. The LSE's offer is worth about the same, according to a person familiar with the situation. Italy's Borsa Italiana will discuss the LSE's offer again at a board meeting on Friday. It spent hours discussing the LSE's complex offer on Thursday. "At the moment, the only offer under discussion is the one from the LSE," a Borsa spokeswoman said on Friday. Borsa said after Thursday's meeting ended there were no other offers. A Paris-based NYSE Euronext spokeswoman declined to comment on the WSJ report. Stock exchanges are consolidating globally as they search for cost savings in an increasingly competitive trading environment. Both the LSE and Borsa Italiana have come under the spotlight and the United States' Nasdaq Stock Market ( NDAQ.O ) is already the LSE's biggest shareholder with a 30 percent stake. Nasdaq, which is in the process of buying Nordic and Baltics market operator OMX, has indicated it would not make another European buyout until it felt comfortable with progress on this deal. Market watchers are expecting Deutsche Boerse AG ( DB1Gn.DE ), which runs the Frankfurt stock market, to come up with its own counterbid for Borsa Italiana. But in a presentation slides prepared for Deutsche Boerse's investor day and posted on the company's website, the exchange said it was focusing on organic growth and did not mention the current takeover situation at Borsa Italiana. NYSE Euronext was formed by the merger of the largest U.S. stock exchange with Paris-based Euronext. The LSE offer could only take the form of a holding company comprising the two, Borsa Italiana board member Alessandro Pansa said on Thursday. The NYSE Euronext offer is at a preliminary stage and could be restructured, according to the WSJ report. NYSE Euronext is the parent of the New York Stock Exchange. LSE shares were up 0.52 percent at 1360 pence at 0730 GMT. NYSE Euronext shares in Paris were flat at 57.40 euros. (Additional reporting by Raoul Sachs and Nick Antonovics in Paris)
