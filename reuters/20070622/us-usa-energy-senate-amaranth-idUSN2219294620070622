 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A former energy trader for collapsed hedge fund Amaranth Advisors LLC will testify next week at a U.S. Senate hearing on the role of speculation in natural gas markets, according to a witness list published on Friday. 

 Greenwich, Connecticut-based Amaranth collapsed after sustaining $6.4 billion in losses in September on a series of bad bets in the natural gas market, the biggest-ever hedge fund meltdown. Shane Lee, a former Amaranth natural gas trader, will testify at the hearing, along with big industrial natural gas consumers and academic experts, the committee said in a notice. After Amaranth, Lee joined a team of commodities traders that founded Calgary-based Solengo Capital, which is headed by Brian Hunter, whose team made the bets that caused the formerly $9.3 billion Amaranth fund group to implode. Lee could not be reached for comment. It is unclear how much money Solengo has raised, but marketing documents said the fund "is structured to become a multi-billion dollar commodity investment vehicle." The panel, chaired by Democrat Carl Levin of Michigan, has scheduled a June 25 hearing on "Excessive Speculation In The Natural Gas Market." "Excessive speculation by a single hedge fund, Amaranth LLC, dominated the natural gas market and distorted natural gas futures prices," according to the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. A July 9 hearing is expected to include officials from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the IntercontinentalExchange Inc. ( ICE.N ) and the New York Mercantile Exchange NMX.N, the panel said. The Congress for years has weighed whether it needs to assert more authority over hedge funds. Senate Democrats have introduced legislation that would require more regulation of over-the-counter exchanges like the IntercontinentalExchange. Democrats in the House of Representatives have similar proposals. (Reporting by  Chris Baltimore  in Washington and  Dane Hamilton  in New York)
