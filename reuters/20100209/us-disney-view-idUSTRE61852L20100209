 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co beat expectations on quarterly earnings as a recovering advertising market boosted its media operations and offset flat revenues at its parks and studio divisions. 

 COMMENTARY: RICK MUNARRIZ, ANALYST, MOTLEY FOOL "I liked how the operating margins increased everywhere expect the parks, which are obviously going to be laggards as far as attendance goes. "It's a solid report from a company that's supposed to be pretty steady because it does have recession-resistant aspects to it. "If you look at the theme parks, to me that's impressive, because that's a good sign that the economy is bottoming out and people are coming back to Disney, or at least not leaving in droves as they were earlier this year." JAMES MARSH, ANALYST, PIPER JAFFRAY "There was strength across the board. Media networks were inline but the rest of the segments looked better than expected. "I would point to the resiliency of their media networks business. You get consistent revenue growth out of there, consistent operating income growth, and I think that's something people forget about. "They are always so focused on the park and resorts and studio entertainment, and they forget how powerful a franchise they have within that media networks business, largely driven by ESPN, which is a juggernaut." JASON HELFSTEIN, ANALYST, OPPENHEIMER & CO "It was a stronger than expected quarter, primarily driven by cost initiatives at the studio. "The material thing is the studio was much better than we thought. Basically, everything was better than the Street, but for us the big surprise was the studio. The most bullish people were at 40 to 42 cents, and they did 44." (Reporting by  Gabriel Madway ,  Paul Thomasch  and  Ian Sherr )
