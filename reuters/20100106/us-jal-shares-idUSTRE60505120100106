 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Shares of Japan Airlines 9205.T fell more than 5 percent on Wednesday after the Nikkei business daily reported the Development Bank of Japan (DBJ) and the Ministry of Finance are seeking court-led bankruptcy proceedings. 

 The state-owned DBJ, JAL's largest creditor, favors a prepackaged-bankruptcy option, which is also preferred by the government-backed Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corp of Japan, the paper said. JAL, Asia's largest carrier by revenue, is seeking its fourth state bailout since 2001 as it grapples with $16 billion in debt, a massive pension deficit and dozens of unprofitable flight routes. Shares of JAL were down 5.6 percent at 85 yen at 0021 GMT, underperforming a 0.2 percent gain in the benchmark Nikkei average  .N225 . (Reporting by  Taiga Uranaka ; Editing by  Chris Gallagher )
