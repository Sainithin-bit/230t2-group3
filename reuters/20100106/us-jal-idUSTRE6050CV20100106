 TOKYO  (Reuters) - A turnaround fund backed by the Japanese government is considering investing about 300 billion yen ($3.3 billion) in Japan Airlines 9205.T in a rescue plan that will also include the carrier filing for bankruptcy, a source familiar with the matter said. 

 The fund, called the Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corp of Japan (ETIC), has asked JAL's creditors to forgive about 350 billion yen ($3.8 billion) in debts as part of the restructuring plan, three sources familiar with the matter said. The sources declined to be named because the discussions between the ETIC and banks are not public. The ETIC declined to comment. ($1=92.04 yen) (Editing by Greg Mahlich)
