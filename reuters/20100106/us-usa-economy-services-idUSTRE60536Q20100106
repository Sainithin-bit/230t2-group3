 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. services sector grew in December but at a very marginal pace, according to an industry report released on Wednesday. 

 The Institute for Supply Management said its services index rose to 50.1 in December from 48.7 in November. That was slightly below the 50.5 median forecast of 53 economists surveyed by Reuters. November was originally reported at 48.7. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector. (Reporting by  Chris Reese ; editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)
