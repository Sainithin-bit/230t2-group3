 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Global stocks eked out slight gains on Wednesday after U.S. services sector data supported a slow but steady recovery and lifted the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen. 

 Trading across most asset classes remained thin, however, as traders refrained from taking fresh positions before a Friday report on the U.S. labor market. Employment is seen the keystone to the  economic recovery story that since March has helped drive world stocks up to 15-month highs. The U.S. Institute for Supply Management said its index of service sector activity index rose to 50.1 from 48.7 in November. The reading by the private U.S. industry group was below economists' expectations of 50.5, but indicated expansion. "The trend is our friend," said Torsten Slok, a senior economist at Deutsche Bank in New York. "The sign that the service sector is improving is a sign that the things are moving in the right direction." Global shares held firm after the U.S. ADP Employer Services report showed a bigger-than-expected slowdown in job losses in December. The ADP data is a precursor to the closely watched government non-farm payrolls report, where economists expect a loss of 8,000 jobs for the month. World stocks as measured by MSCI .MIWO00000PUS inched up 0.17 percent to 1,194.91, their highest level since the darkest days of the financial crisis in September 2008. Earlier in the session, this index hit a fresh 52-week high at 1,196.42, Reuters data showed. Earlier in the session, two of the three major U.S. stock indexes hit fresh 52-week highs. The S&P 500 climbed as high as 1,139.19, while the Nasdaq rose as high as 2,314.07. But Wall Street traded flat at the close in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average  .DJI  rose 1.66 points, or 0.02 percent, to 10,573.68. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  rose just 0.62 point, or 0.05 percent, to 1,137.14 and the Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  dropped 7.62 points, or 0.33 percent, to 2,301.09. European shares rebounded from losses. The FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  rose 0.06 percent to 1,061.01. Earlier, Japan's Nikkei gained 0.46 percent to 10,731.45, a 15-month closing high. The U.S. dollar rose against the yen on Wednesday, after the yen weakened in the wake of the resignation of Japanese Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii. Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama said Deputy Prime Minister Naoto Kan will become finance minister, with Fujii -- one of the few experienced members of the novice Democratic Party-led government -- resigning due to ill health. At 4:16 p.m. in New York, the dollar rose 0.64 percent to 92.31 yen. The euro took a brief battering on Wednesday on worries the European Union would not rescue fiscally struggling Greece. European Central Bank officials were to visit Athens over the next few days to discuss Greece's financial difficulties, but foreign exchange markets were stirred up by a media report quoting ECB executive board member Juergen Stark as saying Greece would not be bailed out. Stark's reported comments flew in the face of what EU leaders have suggested, however, and the euro recovered most of its poise. The euro rose 0.32 percent to $1.4414. The dollar slipped against a basket of trading-partner currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index .DXY off 0.21 percent at 77.454. Overshadowing markets was the investor apathy ahead of more confirmation that the world economy, and particularly the United States, is recovering in a sustainable manner. As a result, much of the focus this week is on the monthly U.S. jobs data due on Friday. "The U.S. jobs data on Friday will be important, but the feedback you are getting shows that the trend is clearly improving," said Bernard McAlinden, investment strategist at NCB Stockbrokers in Dublin. U.S. Treasuries prices fell on Wednesday, ending a two-day recovery as investors grew nervous before the jobs report, which according to some economists may show the first month of jobs growth since December 2007. The yield of the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note climbed 0.06 percentage point to 3.82 percent. Its price was down 16/32 point to 96-10/32. A return to job growth could challenge bond investors' assumption that weak consumer activity will keep inflation in check and allow the Federal Reserve to hold its target interest rate low for some time to come. In energy and commodities prices, U.S. light sweet crude oil rose $1.38, or 1.69 percent, to $83.15 per barrel,, and spot gold prices rose $19.80, or 1.77 percent, to $1138.40.
