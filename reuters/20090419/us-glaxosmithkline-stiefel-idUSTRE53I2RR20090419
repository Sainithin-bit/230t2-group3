 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline PLC ( GSK.L ) is close to a deal to buy U.S. skincare specialist Stiefel Laboratories for about $3 billion, the Wall Street Journal said on its website on Sunday, citing unnamed sources. 

 The deal for Stiefel, which is partly owned by private equity firm Blackstone Group ( BX.N ), is expected to be announced on Monday, the report said, adding there is still a chance it could fall apart. A person familiar with the matter told Reuters a month ago that Stiefel was considering selling itself and had asked Blackstone to seek offers for the business. Stiefel is the world's largest independent dermatology company and is viewed as a potentially attractive asset for major drugmakers, industry experts have said. The source had told Reuters that Blackstone and the company's family owners were seeking a speedy sale. The Wall Street Journal, which had first reported news of the possible sale last month, said the business had drawn interest from a number of major drug companies, including Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ.N ) and Novartis AG ( NOVN.VX ).
