 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wall Street's workforce shed 1,200 jobs in March, the third month in a row of pink slips, with the latest headcount sliding to its lowest since October 1993, a state labor market analyst said on Thursday. 

 Total employment in New York City's most important industry fell to 156,000 positions in March from February, James Brown, the analyst, said by telephone. The latest total was 100 fewer positions than in November 1993, he said. (Reporting by  Joan Gralla ; Editing by  Chizu Nomiyama )
