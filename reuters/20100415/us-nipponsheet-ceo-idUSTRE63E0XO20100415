 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Nippon Sheet Glass Co Ltd ( 5202.T ) named former DuPont ( DD.N ) executive Craig Naylor as its new president and CEO on Thursday, making him the second non-Japanese to head the Tokyo-based glass maker. 

 Nippon Sheet Glass had been searching for a new chief executive since Stuart Chambers, a British national, stepped down late last year to spend more time with his family. Naylor, 61, a U.S. citizen, will join the company on May 1 and assume the responsibilities of president and CEO on June 29, Nippon Sheet said in a statement. Foreign CEO's are rare among Japanese firms. Among the handful atop large companies are Nissan Motor Co's ( 7201.T ) Carlos Ghosn and Howard Stringer of Sony Corp ( 6758.T ). Naylor joined DuPont in 1970 and steadily rose up the ranks of the chemicals giant. He most recently served as group vice president of U.S.-based DuPont Electronic & Communication Technologies from June 2004 to December 2006. Naylor was also a non-executive director at Delphi Corp from February 2005 to September 2009, Nippon Sheet said in a release.
