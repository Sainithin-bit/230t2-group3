 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - The European Central Bank's decision to keep its liquidity taps open for the first quarter of next year will keep money markets bloated with cash and ensure it remains in full control of borrowing costs as it nurtures the fledgling economic recovery. 

 INDEXING UPCOMING 12-MONTH REFI TO TRACK POLICY RATE HIKES * It keeps open the option of raising interest rates at some point next year, which would push up the final interest payment for banks on the 12-month funds. * At the same time, it does not send such a clear signal on a future rate move as adding a spread to the cost of borrowing, another option considered by policymakers. * Knowledge that the cost of borrowing at the ECB's last handout of one-year loans could suddenly rise is likely to temper enthusiasm for the funds among some banks. Those who saw it as an opportunistic last chance to grab cheap funds will think twice, while banks that really need the cash will see it as an acceptable trade-off for funding security. * Manageable demand would make it easier for the ECB to raise interest rates next year if they thought it was necessary. If demand is huge, markets would be oversupplied with excess liquidity until the end of next year, meaning hikes would probably have little impact on market rates. KEEPING FULL ALLOTMENT AT OPERATIONS AT LEAST UNTIL END Q1 * Keeping the option in place to lend banks as much as they want will guarantee that at least a certain amount of excess liquidity is likely to remain in money markets. * It will maintain the current downward pressure on rates and keep the ECB in control of them allowing it to continue nurturing the fledgling euro zone economic recovery. * The last six-month operation, to be conducted in late March, will give banks a chance to take out as much funding as they need to tide them over until the fourth quarter. CUTTING NUMBER OF 3-MONTH REFIS, ENDING 6 AND 12 MONTH OPS * It should have little real impact on banks. The ECB is keeping plenty of options open to grab funds, meaning that banks that need funds can just switch into shorter-term loans, which they can them roll over when the time comes. BANK PROFITS * Keeping down borrowing costs will cheer commercial bank chiefs. The ultra-low central bank rates are allowing banks to rebuild their balance sheets by lending on to firms and consumers at a tidy profit and invest in assets such as government bonds that also enrich profits (Reporting by Marc Jones; Editing by Toby Chopra)
