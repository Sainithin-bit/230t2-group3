 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank is expected to keep interest rates at a record low of 1.0 percent on Thursday and sketch out the first stage of plans to withdraw the ultra-accommodative lending that has been key in its efforts to combat the finanicial crisis. 

 Below are highlights of ECB policymakers' comments since the Governing Council's November 5 meeting. To read full stories, double-click numbers in brackets. GERTRUDE TUMPEL GUGERELL (EXECUTIVE BOARD), DEC 2 "We see several positive signals (on economy) ahead." "We expect that the growth of loans to enterprises is likely to moderate further before starting to recover." AXEL WEBER (GERMANY), NOV 26 "I don't want to talk much about the exit strategies but it is important that they cannot be pushed off to the never-never, we have to find the exit at the right time," EWALD NOWOTNY (AUSTRIA), NOV 25 "Monetary policy will make sure that the extraordinary measures will be phased out and the liquidity that was provided will be drained to avoid any risk for price stability in the medium and long term. IVAN SRAMKO (SLOVAKIA), NOV 25 "My personal view is that the revision will be for a smaller decline this year (compared with September expectations), while growth will by slightly better then expected next year," he said of December staff projections. "I see no major changes to inflation forecasts." JEAN-CLAUDE TRICHET (PRESIDENT), NOV 25 "We have managed to avoid deflation risks from becoming a reality." JEAN-CLAUDE TRICHET (PRESIDENT), NOV 23 "As of today, it is still premature to declare the financial crisis over ... But when the appropriate time comes, there should be no concern about the ECB's determination and ability to exit." MIGUEL ANGEL ORDONEZ (SPAIN), NOV 23 "We still don't know to what extent the incipient world recovery is underpinned with enough elements of its own to allow us to withdraw exceptional stimulus without running the risk that activity falls back." LORENZO BINI SMAGHI (EXECUTIVE BOARD), NOV 20 "There is a risk that market participants might interpret a decision about one part of the exit as paving the way for the rest." "A delayed exit postpones the pain but in the end the pain is greater... Late exits seem to be the rule, and possibly also the cause of the crises that follow." VITOR CONSTANCIO (PORTUGAL), NOV 20 "For the operational horizon of monetary policy, that is 18 to 24 months, at this moment the general economic situation and all estimates indicate that inflation is under control." JEAN-CLAUDE TRICHET (PRESIDENT), NOV 20 "Any non-standard measure whose continuation would pose a threat to the achievement of price stability must be undone promptly and unequivocally." "Emergency treatment and strong medicines are sometimes necessary. But, if their use is prolonged, they can lead to dependence and even addiction." "Not all our liquidity measures will be needed to the same extent as in the past." AXEL WEBER (GERMANY), NOV 20 "I wouldn't use interest rates as a tool (to control asset bubbles), interest rates are there to ensure price stability and that's consumer price stability." LORENZO BINI SMAGHI (EXECUTIVE BOARD), NOV 19 "The question is, how long can low levels of interest rates be maintained without creating distortions in the efficient allocation of funds by the financial sector, and possibly endangering price stability?" "Monetary policy might thus be insufficiently effective in stimulating economic recovery, but too effective with respect to risks of asset price bubbles in the financial sector." "I would prefer not to listen to those who are recommending a bias in deciding the timing of the exit i.e. that it's preferable to err on the side of late rather than early withdrawal." JEAN-CLAUDE TRICHET (PRESIDENT), NOV 17 "The (Q3 GDP) figures confirm our baseline scenario, that of a progressive and gradual revival of the economy. What we are now observing is more favourable than we projected some months ago." JUERGEN STARK (EXECUTIVE BOARD), NOV 17 "Monetary policy with a prespecified, fixed-term policy horizon runs the risk of having too short-sighted a perspective of the economy." "We have our first opportunity (to review support measures) in December... At the same time policy rates could already be changed." GUY QUADEN (BELGIUM), NOV 16 "Crisis prevention will soon have to take over from crisis management." "Too late an exit would sow the seeds for new financial excesses, with a risk of inflation." "The sequencing of the exit is not pre-defined, nor is its end-point, and will depend on developments in financial markets and in the real economy." ATHANASIOS ORPHANIDES (CYPRUS), NOV 16 "Discontinuation of all of our non-standard measures would represent a tightening of monetary conditions. So if we think about it in these terms, the associated decisions would have to be covered rather by considerations similar to those determining a conventional policy tightening." ERKKI LIIKANEN (FINLAND), NOV 16 "To what extent the emerging growth momentum is self-sustaining remains an open question. Rising unemployment rates cast a long shadow over the growth prospects." Against that backdrop he said "measures taken by central banks and governments to support growth, rightly remain fully in place." AXEL WEBER (GERMANY), NOV 16 "Stabilisation does not mean sustainable recovery, neither for financial markets nor for growth. Therefore we have to remain vigilant and keep an eye on all the risks." JOSE MANUEL GONZALEZ-PARAMO (EXECUTIVE BOARD), NOV 13 Asked if rates could at some stage be raised while some members of the euro zone were still in recession, Gonzalez Paramo said: "With the figures we have today ... we cannot rule it out." IVAN SRAMKO (SLOVAKIA), NOV 13 "As the risks regarding future economic development are no longer only on the downside... I am quite optimistic that the economy has already started to bottom out." GEORGE PROVOPOULOS (GREECE), NOV 12 "The recovery remains slow and fragile, as unemployment continues to climb, the cleansing of banks' balance sheets from problematic assets has not been completed and the economic outlook continues to be surrounded by considerable uncertainty." MICHAEL BONELLO (MALTA), NOV 12 "In taking such a decision (on exit) we need to ensure that the withdrawal is gradual and non-disruptive in its impact, and we will also have to see to it that the liquidity is absorbed in a way which counters any threat to price levels." AXEL WEBER (GERMANY), NOV 11 "It is still too early for an exit from expansive monetary and fiscal policy measures. However, the right time for the exit must not be missed." JOSE MANUEL GONZALEZ-PARAMO (EXECUTIVE BOARD), NOV 10 "The specific operational steps of an exit should not be interpreted as signaling imminent changes to key policy rates." "Longer-term liquidity-absorbing operations could be envisaged in a scenario where it is clear that the need to absorb persists for a certain period of time, and where a significant tightening in monetary policy is needed." "The precise sequencing of (support withdrawal) will depend on the circumstances prevailing at the time." ON COVERED BONDS "There is no particular need to dispose of the purchased bonds at any future moment in time, as it does not interfere with monetary policy implementation." "We could therefore decide to hold the portfolio until maturity and let it gradually shrink over time as a result of redemptions. Alternatively, the portfolio could be disposed of in a gradual way that would make it possible to avoid market distortions." JUERGEN STARK (EXECUTIVE BOARD), NOV 10 "On the money market -- if the situation in money markets improves, we will be in a position to withdraw some of the (liquidity) measures." YVES MERSCH (LUXEMBOURG), NOV 10 "It would not be surprising if our (GDP) forecast would be revised upwards," he said referring to new ECB staff forecasts due in December. JUERGEN STARK (EXECUTIVE BOARD), NOV 9 "Changing policy rates does not necessarily entail a phasing-out of all the measures of enhanced credit support." JEAN-CLAUDE TRICHET (PRESIDENT), NOV 9 "On interest rates, we have our responsibilities, we have to take into account different structures, shocks of the economies. The purpose is to deliver price stability. Risks (on inflation) are balanced." (Compiled by Frankfurt newsroom)
