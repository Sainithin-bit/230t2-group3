 (Reuters) - Costco Wholesale Corp ( COST.O ) reported a six percent rise in November same-store sales, helped by an increase in gasoline prices and a weaker U.S. dollar, but missed market estimates. 

 Analysts on average were expecting a rise of 8.1 percent in same-store sales, including the impact of fuel prices and foreign exchange, according to Thomson Reuters data. Same-store sales at U.S. locations rose 2 percent, while international division sales surged 21 percent, the company said in a statement. November net sales rose 9 percent to $6.04 billion. Excluding the impact of gasoline prices and foreign exchange, the company reported flat U.S. comparable sales, while on a local currency basis, international same-store sales rose 7 percent.
