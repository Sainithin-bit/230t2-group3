 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Euro-zone banks can cope with the European Central Bank's phasing out of extra liquidity and necessary further balance sheet write-downs, ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet said on Thursday. 

 In an interview with Reuters TV, Trichet dismissed concerns that some banks might not cope with the slow withdrawal of extra liquidity operations, which the ECB outlined on Thursday. "This phasing out, which is gradual and timely ... is only accompanying the fact that the market is functioning in a much better way," he said. Banks could also cope with balance sheet adjustment, Trichet said, offering no update on an ECB estimate in May that banks faced a further $282 billion in write-downs by the end of 2010. "It is clear that a lot of write-offs are unavoidable after a period of recession, we also have the sentiment that banks have the capacity to face up to these necessary write-offs," he said. Trichet also said the ECB would continue to offer banks unlimited funds in the first quarter of 2010 at the same fixed interest rates it is offering now. Currently, main weekly operations are conducted at the main policy rate and the ECB has the option of charging banks more for long-term funding, an option it is going to use for the first time at the December 16 12-month operation. "We have foreseen for the first quarter of next year to continue to have the same allocation of liquidity, it's exactly the same as for the previous period, for the previous quarter," he said. "In the first quarter we will have less frequent operations over one month, three months and six months." When asked about the euro zone economy, he said: "We know we have a bumpy road ahead of us."
