 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - The following are comments by European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet and ECB Vice-President Lucas Papademos at a news conference held after the bank's Governing Council kept interest rates at a record low of 1 percent on Thursday. 

 ON TRIP TO CHINA "On China, I would say what was very, very important was that we had the possibility of exchanging views. I would say in a very, very open fashion on both sides, in a very friendly fashion on both sides with as much, I have to say, as possible going in the fundamentals. And we expressed our views very, very clearly and starting with what we consider would be, of course, the interest of all the parties concerned. And we had a very, very important exchange of views and the Chinese authority themselves were very clear on their present view. I said myself after this contact that they were confirming that they will continue to implement the reforms of the exchange market that had been introduced in 2005. But I said this should not be overassessed to overinterpreted in any respect as signaling future, close future decisions." TRUSTS SINCERITY OF U.S. ON DOLLAR "I trust the sincerity of the U.S. authorities (on strong dollar), both sincerity of the Secretary of the Treasury and the sincerity, of course, of the Chairman of the Fed." NEED FOR ALERTNESS AFTER DUBAI "As regards Dubai, I think it is an illustration of the fact that we have nervousness on the market. I don't think we should overassess the gravity of what is happening in Dubai itself. At the same time, we have to consider the impact that a relatively modest event had on the market . So  it calls for, I would say, continuing to be alert and it calls for working with all the energy that we have in the various workshops that have been open through the financial stability board in all the cooperative workshops that exist at the global level and also at the open level to work on augmenting the resilience of the financial sphere." REFINANCING DECSION SHOWS NEUTRAL STANCE "We could have had rate with margin as had always been indicated very clearly to the market as being possible. And we had the possibility of having this indexed rate. I trust that the Governing Council considered after due meditation, if I may, that it was the right way to be neutral, not to give a signal on the interest rates either in the direction of the, I would say, loosening our policies or in the direction of hardening the policy. The idea was we have an appropriate way of telling the market, as I said already at the beginning of this press conference, we are neutral. And the present rates are appropriate. We are neutral." MEASURES TAKEN ARE RIGHT COMPROMISE "The measures that we took today were exactly the right compromise between the various constraints that we have. So I would say it is -- you have there the illustration of this concept of being gradual and being timely." CONFIDENCE IN GREECE GOVERNEMENT "As regard Greece, I would say that I fully trust that taking into account the situation that the new government of Greece has to cope with in terms of fiscal situation in particular, I have confidence that the appropriate decisions will be taken. And I think that it is what comes out of the last discussion, which took place in the euro group, in the Ecofin. So I cannot say anything, but taking into account the gravity of the situation, I have confidence that the government of Greece will take the appropriate decision." ABILITY TO TARGET ASSET PRICES "Thanks to the monetary analysis and thanks also to the fact that we have our definition of price stability in the medium run permits us to incorporate elements that are associated with credit outstanding ... including impact on asset inflation, which could itself create inflation through the wealth channel and if there is a bust after the boom, destabilize prices through the deflationary tendencies or risks that could materialize." NOT HARDENING POLICY "We again consider at the present moment that it is very important not to signal anything on the interest rates . And in that sense, if I may, the message from us is clear. We have the progressive timely gradual phasing out of the nonconventional measures. And that is something which only accompanies what we are observing on the market. We are not signaling anything in terms of hardening our monetary policy, absolutely nothing." PAPADEMOS ON SYSTEMIC RISK BOARD "Now if the macro-prudential recommendations of the ESRB are not -- this was the question -- are not implemented in an effective and timely manner, then if I can say that the mission -- the mission of the macro-prudential supervision will not be fully accomplished. So it is because implementation is key. So it is really essential that the macro-prudential recommendations are translated into effective action if we are going to accomplish the ultimate objective of the new framework for macro-prudential supervision, which is to prevent or at least to minimize the likelihood of future crises and to strengthen the resilience of the system."
