 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. crude prices fell toward $76 a barrel on Thursday as weak U.S. service sector data and rising U.S. oil inventories outweighed losses in the dollar. 

 Data showed the U.S. services sector unexpectedly contracted in November, with an index measuring activity fell to its lowest reading since July and put pressure on U.S. stocks. .N. U.S. crude for January delivery settled at $76.46, down 14 cents. London Brent crude rose 48 cents to $78.36 a barrel. Oil traders have watched wider macroeconomic factors this year for signs of a turnaround in the economy that could support flagging fuel demand. "The inventory situation is still providing a bearish backdrop. But the dollar fell very close to recent lows versus the euro, providing a lift to energy." said Tom Bentz, analyst at BNP Paribas Commodity Futures in New York. Crude prices tumbled on Wednesday after the release of U.S. inventory data, which showed crude and gasoline inventories jumped last week as the weak economy continued to batter demand in the world's top consumer. Economic data was mixed on Thursday as new applications for U.S. jobless benefits unexpectedly fell last week to the lowest level in more than 14 months, suggesting a labor market edging toward stability, while productivity was less robust in the third quarter. The White House said a recent private sector payroll report had signaled that November's unemployment level may tick up from 10.2 percent in October, but stressed it was not predicting the outcome of Friday's closely watched monthly payroll data. "Crude oil futures are flat at this time as energy markets, just like the stocks and currency markets, are awaiting tomorrow's unemployment data," said Tom Knight, trader for Truman Arnold in Texarkana, Texas. The euro clung to gains against the U.S. dollar after the European Central Bank announced its first steps to unwind some of the extraordinary measures it took to prop up the euro zone economy during the global crisis. Speaking after the ECB kept rates at a record low of 1 percent as expected, ECB President Jean-Claude laid out a number of decisions on ending and tightening up the measures it has taken to support liquidity in the banking sector. Investors have taken cash out of oil and other commodities and into safe haven plays like the dollar at times this year when negative economic data is released. Kuwaiti Oil Minister Sheikh Ahmad al-Abdullah al-Sabah told reporters the OPEC nation preferred oil prices remain in the $70-80 a barrel range, adding he supported leaving crude output targets unchanged when the producer group meets on December 22 in Angola. OPEC last year agreed to output cuts of 4.2 million barrels per day as part of efforts to prop up oil prices and balance markets, after slumping demand sent crude from record highs near $150 a barrel in July 2008 to below $33 in December 2008. Adding to OPEC's challenges, the biggest non-OPEC oil exporter Russia set a fourth consecutive monthly output record in November, averaging more than 10 million barrels per day.
