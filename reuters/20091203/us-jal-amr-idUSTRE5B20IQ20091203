 TOKYO  (Reuters) - American Airlines said it, Oneworld alliance members and private equity fund TPG would be willing to invest $1.1 billion in Japan Airlines to bolster the airline's finances and prevent it from defecting to a rival alliance. 

 American Airlines said the total financial benefit to JAL would be equivalent to $1.8 billion when factoring in an estimated $700 million for the net present value of antitrust immunity over a period of 10 years. American Airlines has said it would apply for antitrust immunity with JAL under an "open skies" treaty to liberalize air travel between the U.S. and Japan. The treaty is expected to be agreed upon by the two governments as early as this month. (Reporting by  Nathan Layne ; Editing by  Edwina Gibbs )
