 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - The European Central Bank has decided to start unwinding some of the extraordinary measures it took to prop up the euro zone economy during the global crisis, ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet said on Thursday. 

 He told a news conference the ECB had decided to hold its last six months refinancing operation on March 31 and would link the rate on its 12-month tender this month to rates at shorter-term tenders. "The improved conditions on financial markets have indicated that not all of our measures are needed to the same extent as in the past," Trichet said. "We decided that the rate in the last 12 month longer-term refinancing operation to be allotted on December 16 ... will be fixed at the average minimum bid rate of the MROs over the life of this operation," he said. Earlier the ECB said it was keeping its benchmark interest rate on hold at a record low of 1 percent for the seventh month running, as expected by economists.
