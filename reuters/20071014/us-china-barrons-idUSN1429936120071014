 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - While investor Warren Buffett may have taken profits, many fund managers think China's market can continue to rally for a while longer, according to a report in Barron's. 

 The report said Chinese companies today have some of the world's largest market caps. It said Warren Buffett sold his position last week, but PetroChina ( 0857.HK ) is up 50 percent for the year, giving it a market value of $383 billion. Rival BP's ( BP.L ) market cap is $238 billion, the article said. The article said that while China's central bank raised rates trying to curb growth, the market has continued surging, and the U.S. Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut was taken as a green light for more speculation. The article said fund managers are still buying Chinese shares, including China Mobile ( 0941.HK ), Huaneng Power ( 600011.SS ) and Sinopec Shanghai Petrochemical ( 600688.SS ).
