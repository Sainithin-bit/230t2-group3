 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Software maker SAP ( SAPG.DE ) would consider more acquisitions following the largest takeover in the company's history, SAP's chief executive reiterated in an interview with Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung newspaper. 

 The German company would consider large takeovers mainly outside its main business and if they offered the chance to become the leader in a sector immediately, Chief Executive Henning Kagermann was reported as saying in the article published on Sunday. A large acquisition such as the 4.8 billion euro ($6.82 billion) buy of Business Objects BOBJ.PA BOBJ.O, announced on October 7, would not make sense in SAP's established business, he said, Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung reported. The company is still concentrating on expanding its existing business by winning more contracts and customers and on making small takeovers, Kagermann told the paper, repeating a previous stance.
