 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - National Oilwell Varco Inc's ( NOV.N ) shares are up 189 percent in the past 12 months, but a 15 percent to 20 percent gain during the next year is not a big stretch, according to an article in Barron's. 

 The report said the company, a drilling-equipment supplier, has profited from a dominant position providing equipment to oil and gas drillers, and it has strong new orders and backlog figures. Barron's said its shares, which traded around $77 for most of last week, are not outrageously expensive. Based on 2008 consensus estimates, its price/earnings multiple is 17.7, which is in line with the rest of the industry, the article stated. Barron's said a good time to re-evaluate the company's fundamentals will be October 24. when it reports third-quarter earnings. If it posts strong growth and gives an upbeat forecast, that could spur further stock gains, the article said.
