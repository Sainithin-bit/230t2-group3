 LONDON  (Reuters) - Standard Life ( SL.L ) is in talks with the world's biggest reinsurer Swiss Re RUKN.VX on a possible joint offer for Resolution Group ( RSL.L ) and they could confirm the talks as soon as Monday, an industry source said. 

 The Sunday Express said the two groups had discussed making a 750-pence-a-share ($15.26-a share) joint bid, ahead of the 660 pence offer from Pearl which was rejected last week. If the bid was successful, Standard Life would be expected to get Resolution's new business, distribution and asset management while Swiss Re would get the closed-life funds. Resolution announced plans to merge with Friends Provident FP.L in July -- a move that would create the fifth-largest UK-listed insurer -- but Pearl threatened to muscle in on the tie-up just 24 hours after the terms were published. Resolution rejected Pearl's proposed takeover on Wednesday, saying it significantly undervalued the group. Standard Life declined to comment on the report and no-one at Resolution was immediately available for comment. Swiss Re also declined to comment. Resolution has previously said it will consider alternatives to the Friends deal if they add more value.
