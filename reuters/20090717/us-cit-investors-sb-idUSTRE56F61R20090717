 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - RiverSource Investments Inc and Fidelity could face some of the biggest losses from stock holdings in CIT Group Inc if the hard-hit commercial lender declares bankruptcy. 

 As last-ditch talks this week to secure U.S. government rescue financing for CIT collapsed, fears of a Chapter 11 filing caused some of the company's debt to plunge to 52 cents on the dollar on Thursday. Common shares in the century-old finance company, already down 91 percent this year, dropped $1.22 to 43 cents. Yet even the biggest CIT investors would not suffer major losses, analysts said. "I would guess most of those funds have sold most of their stock by this point," said Morningstar research director Russell Kinnel. Fidelity spokesman Alexi Maravel declined to discuss current positions but said it is "reasonable to assume the stock had a relatively insignificant impact on the funds." Fitch Ratings and analysts say bankruptcy is the most likely scenario. In that case, CIT debt would be worth as little as 24 cents on the dollar, and shareholders would be wiped out. RiverSource, a money management unit of Ameriprise Financial Inc, had the largest number of CIT shares at the end of June when it reported holding more than 44.3 million for an 11.4 percent stake, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. RiverSource's Diversified Equity Income valued its stake at just $30.2 million in June. Second was FMR, a Fidelity company that told the SEC it held 37.4 million CIT shares, or a roughly 10 percent stake, at the end of February. That stake declined to 29.5 million shares, or 7.6 percent, at the end of March. Brandes Investment Partners LLP, a San Diego firm managing more than $42 billion, was CIT's third-largest holder in March, according to Reuters Knowledge. Brandes in February reported to the SEC that it held 28.5 million shares. Lipper, a Thomson Reuters company that supplies mutual fund information, analytical tools and commentary, said Brandes sold nearly all its CIT shares by March 30. Officials from these three firms did not return calls seeking comment. Regulatory filings offer a snapshot of investment manager holdings, which can change quickly. The ownership reports also do not reflect any offsetting hedges. CIT, a New York-based commercial lender, has been on a long, steady decline since June 2007, when the credit crunch took hold and prevented non-banks like CIT from accessing new funds from the market. Another way of ranking funds' exposure is as a percentage of their portfolios. A little-known Philadelphia fund manager, Academy Asset Management LLC, may have devoted the greatest part of its portfolio to bets on CIT. Its $2.7 million Academy Select Opportunities Fund had the biggest exposure to CIT at 14.5 percent of its portfolio in March, according to Lipper. Academy said that exposure fell to 11 percent by June 30. Another Academy fund, its Core Equity Fund, ranked third with 3.2 percent of its portfolio invested in CIT on March 30. Officials at Academy could not be reached immediately for comment. SunAmerica Focused Small-Cap Value Portfolio, a fund sold by American International Group Inc's SunAmerica unit, had the second-largest portfolio exposure with 5.2 percent, Lipper said. William Miller's Legg Mason Opportunity Trust, which has rebounded strongly this year, reported a roughly $20 million CIT investment at the end of March, but that represents less than 2 percent of the fund.
