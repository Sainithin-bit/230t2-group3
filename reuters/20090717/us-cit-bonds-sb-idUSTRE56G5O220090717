 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The price of debt of embattled U.S. lender CIT ( CIT.N ) firmed on Friday after a source close to CIT said the company was in talks with JPMorgan Chase ( JPM.N ) and Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) about short-term financing. 

 The price of CIT's floating-rate notes due in August rose to 66.5 cents on the dollar in busy trading, up from about 61 cents late on Thursday, according to MarketAxess. (Reporting by  John Parry ; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
