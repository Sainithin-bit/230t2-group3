 LONDON  (Reuters) - British Airways Plc BAY.L has hired investment bank Reynolds Partners to find a buyer for its loss-making upmarket airline OpenSkies, the Daily Telegraph reported on Friday, without saying where it got the information. 

 The Telegraph said BA's preferred option was a sale of a majority stake in the carrier, which flies from Paris and Amsterdam to New York, and estimates of its value range from 30 to 70 million pounds ($49 to $115 million). A BA spokeswoman said: "We are reviewing all aspects of our business in the current economic environment. OpenSkies is a small part of our business and its losses are not significant compared to losses in other parts of the company." Reynolds Partners was not immediately available for comment. Earlier BA unveiled plans to raise about 600 million pounds through convertible bonds and bank facilities and reported a first-quarter operating loss of 100 million.
