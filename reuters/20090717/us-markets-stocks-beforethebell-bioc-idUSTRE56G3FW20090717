 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of BioCryst Pharmaceuticals ( BCRX.O ) rose 33 percent to $5.60 in premarket trading on Friday, after the company said a late-stage study testing the intravenous form of its experimental influenza drug peramivir showed the drug was not inferior to another flu drug, Tamiflu.
