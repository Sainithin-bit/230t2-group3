 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Tool manufacturer Snap-on Inc ( SNA.N ) said on Thursday it has ended its joint venture with troubled lender CIT ( CIT.N ). 

 Snap-On said it has notified CIT of termination of the operating agreement relating to their Snap-on Credit LLC joint venture. The joint venture was established in 1999 and provides a broad range of financial services to Snap-on's U.S. franchisees and customers. The company said as a consequence of the termination, Snap-on will buy out CIT's interest in the joint venture for around $8.2 million. Snap-on Credit will continue to service the existing portfolio of around $834 million in contracts owned by CIT. (Reporting by  Yinka Adegoke ; Editing Bernard Orr)
