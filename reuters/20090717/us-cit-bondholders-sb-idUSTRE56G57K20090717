 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Many of CIT Group Inc's ( CIT.N ) largest bondholders are pursuing a "debt for new debt" exchange on Friday, as the large lender to small and mid-sized businesses teeters on the brink of collapse, a person familiar with the matter said. 

 "A debt for equity exchange is not a real consideration," the person said. "The basis for our bondholders' meeting was to discuss debt for new debt exchange." About 10 to 15 bondholders, each with at least $500 million of exposure, on Thursday participated in an emergency call. Among the participants was Pacific Investment Management Co, the unit of German insurer Allianz SE ( ALVG.DE ) led by prominent bond fund manager Bill Gross, the person said. The person requested anonymity because the conference call was not open to the public. (Reporting by  Jennifer Ablan ; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
