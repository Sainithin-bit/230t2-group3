 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - American International Group Inc ( AIG.N ) filed a shelf registration statement with U.S. regulators on Friday, giving it the capability to issue common or preferred stock in the future. 

 AIG shares fell 3.8 percent to $13 in after-hours trading on Friday from its $13.52 close in regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The company did not specify the amount of the shelf offering in the filing. A shelf registration gives a company the ability to issue common or preferred shares at a subsequent date, but does not necessarily indicate it has any immediate or future plans to do so. The shares "may from time to time be issued at indeterminate prices," AIG said in its filing. (Reporting by  Phil Wahba ; Editing by  Tim Dobbyn )
