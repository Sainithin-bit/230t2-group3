 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc ( UPS.N ) said on Monday it would raise rates by a net 4.9 percent starting January 3, 2011, about a month after FedEx Corp. ( FDX.N ) said it would hike rates. 

 UPS, the world's largest package delivery company, said the net increase was for ground packages, all air express and U.S. origin international shipments. On September 29, FedEx, the world's largest cargo airline, said shipping rates through its Express division and International Priority service would go up 3.9 percent on average starting January 3. UPS and FedEx are considered indicators of U.S. economic activity as their business expands or shrinks with the broader economy. In reporting third-quarter profits, Atlanta-based UPS said in October that it expected a slow economic recovery without a double-dip recession. "That they're able to push across these rate increases for next year means they at least see a steady demand environment," said Kevin Sterling, a transportation analyst at BB&T Capital Markets.
