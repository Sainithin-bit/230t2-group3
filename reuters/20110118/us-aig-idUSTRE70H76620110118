 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - AIG ( AIG.N ) chose Bank of America ( BAC.N ), Deutsche Bank AG ( DBKGn.DE ), Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ) and JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ), to manage the sale of the government's 92 percent stake in the insurer, a person familiar with the situation said on Tuesday. 

 Sources have said that the process likely will begin with a secondary offering in May that could be one of the 10 largest in history. The government is expected to sell at least $15 billion in AIG shares then, and the company is expected to sell another $3 billion on top of that. (Reporting by Ben Berkowitz.
