 SHANGHAI/BEIJING  (Reuters) - Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao vowed on Tuesday to slam the brakes on a credit surge at the start of this year, following reports that the central bank has cut the 2011 lending target for banks by 10 percent. 

 Wen's comments highlighted growing official concern that a tide of bank loans on the back of rapid capital inflows is complicating the government's efforts to rein in inflation. "We must avoid abnormal issuance of credit at the start of the year," Wen said, in a statement published on the government's website, www.gov.cn. Chinese banks had started the year with their usual lending frenzy, handing out 500 billion yuan ($75.6 billion) in new loans in the first week of January alone. That followed the extension of 7.95 trillion yuan in new loans in 2010, overshooting Beijing's 7.5 trillion yuan target and highlighting the need for more decisive policy tightening. Wen told a meeting of the State Council, China's cabinet, that the authorities would use a mix of policy tools to ensure reasonable expansion in credit and money supply. In addition, Beijing would maintain its year-long campaign to curb speculative demand on housing, Wen said. The Chinese central bank raised required reserves on Friday, the fourth hike in just over two months, or the seventh since early 2010. China also raised interest rates twice last year.
