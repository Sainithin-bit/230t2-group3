 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Yum Brands Inc ( YUM.N ) has put its Long John Silver's and A&W All-American Food Restaurants up for sale as it focuses on growth in China and other international markets, the company said on Tuesday. 

 Yum, which gets the majority of its profits from outside the United States, wants to build more KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell restaurants in Europe, Asia and Africa. A&W and Long John Silver's have minimal international exposure and account for just 1,630 of Yum's more than 37,000 restaurants globally. "We do not believe Long John Silver's and A&W-All American Food restaurants fit into our long-term growth strategy," Yum Chief Executive Officer David Novak said in a statement. The Louisville, Kentucky-based company bought both chains for $320 million in 2002 and said it did not expect their eventual sale to have a material impact on its ongoing earnings or cash flow. In 1998, when Yum was spun-off from PepsiCo ( PEP.N ), 22 percent of its profits came from international markets. Today, about 65 percent of the company's profits are from its China and international divisions, and Yum expects that percentage to grow to 75 percent by 2015. Yum shares were up 2.5 percent at $49.02 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by  Lisa Baertlein , editing by Maureen Bavdek and Lisa Von Ahn)
