 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The euro rose to a one-month high against the dollar on Tuesday on central bank buying and a surge in German investor sentiment, while global stocks rose as positive company earnings outlooks boosted confidence in the U.S. economic recovery. 

 The euro rose to a one-month high above $1.34 against the dollar after Germany's ZEW think tank said about 50 percent of investors expect the European Central Bank will have to raise interest rates within the next six months. ZEW's monthly index jumped in December to its highest level since July. The euro rose as high as $1.3467 overnight, though lack of progress at a two-day European debt summit sparked a retreat and it traded up 0.66 percent at $1.3380. "There are still fault lines, especially pertaining to issues about the expansion of the rescue fund," said Simon Derrick, head of currency research at Bank of New York Mellon. "But countries like Russia and China need the euro as a credible alternative currency." Traders said sovereign buying, including demand from Middle Eastern accounts on Tuesday, has helped the euro since it fell to a four-month low beneath $1.29 last week. Optimism about U.S. company earnings reports have helped fuel stocks and hopes that the world's largest economy is on the path of recovery. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  closed 50.55 points, or 0.43 percent, higher at 11,837.93. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  gained 1.78 points, or 0.14 percent, at 1,295.02. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  rose 10.55 points, or 0.38 percent, to 2,765.85. Stocks ended positive after several brokerages raised their price target on Google ( GOOG.O ) and Caterpillar Inc ( CAT.N ), offsetting disappointing Citigroup Inc ( C.N ) results and worries about another medical leave by Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ) Chief Executive Steve Jobs. World stocks as measured by MSCI .MIWD00000PUS advanced 0.63 percent, with the emerging markets index .MSCIEF gaining 0.39 percent. European shares hit their highest close in more than 28 months as euro zone finance ministers inched toward strengthening a rescue fund and investor confidence grew in Germany, Europe's largest economy. The FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of top European shares ended 0.9 percent higher at 1,167.87 points. The front month futures contract for the Nikkei 225 stock index trading in Chicago rose 25 points to 10,620. The dollar was down against a basket of major currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index .DXY off 0.47 percent at 78.966. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar was down 0.16 percent at 82.59. Oil fell 0.27 percent to $91.29 per barrel after the International Energy Agency said members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries had been quietly raising output and the oil producing group insisted the market was amply supplied. Deliveries through a key North American supply route, the Trans-Alaskan pipeline, commenced. Brent oil however, rose closer to $100 a barrel on concerns about North Sea crude supplies. U.S. government bond prices fell, in part from hedging operations at the start of a heavy week of corporate bond issuance. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was down 11/32, its yield at 3.3739 percent. The 2-year U.S. Treasury note was down 1/32, with the yield at 0.5886 percent. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond was down 17/32, the yield at 4.568 percent. Gold rose for a second day, drawing strength from a weaker dollar and demand from key Asian consumers. Spot gold prices rose to $1,367.60 an ounce. Copper rose as the dollar fell and European equities surged on signs of improving economic growth, which suggests better prospects for industrial metals demand.
