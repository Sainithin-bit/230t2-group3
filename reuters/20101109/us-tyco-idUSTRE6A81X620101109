 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Tyco International Ltd ( TYC.N ) set the sale of a majority stake in its electrical and metal unit to a private equity firm as it reported higher-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by its ADT Worldwide division. 

 The industrial conglomerate agreed to sell 51 percent of its electrical and metal products unit, which it had previously planned to spin off, for $720 million in cash to private equity firm Clayton Dubilier & Rice LLC. The move is part of a years-long transformation of the company's portfolio to focus on three core businesses: security, fire safety and valves. The deal will enable Tyco to speed up a $1 billion stock buyback announced in September. Tyco will recognize a gain of about $200 million on the deal. The unit will be renamed Atkore. Tyco also said business conditions were improving and introduced a fiscal 2011 forecast that was not easily comparable with analyst estimates because of varying expectations for how much the sold business would contribute next year. Tyco forecast earnings from continuing operations in the fiscal year now under way of $2.85 to $2.95 per share, while analysts were expecting profit of $3.10 a share. But the Wall Street forecasts included a full-year contribution from the business in which Tyco is selling a majority stake. FBR Capital Markets analyst Ajay Kejriwal had expected profit of $3.20 a share. Stripping out 27 cents, he said, Tyco's top end of the forecast is roughly in line with FBR estimates. The sale of part of Tyco electrical and metal products business, or "TEMP," was a better value for shareholders than a spin-off, said Kejriwal, who rates Tyco "outperform." "That was the big surprise," he said. "The quarter came in a little better and in next year's guidance the TEMP business was the big moving piece." Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ) advised Tyco on the transaction, while Bank of America Merrill Lynch ( BAC.N ), Credit Suisse ( CSGN.VX ) and UBS ( UBSN.VX ) advised Clayton Dubilier & Rice. RECOVERING MARKETS Both analysts and company executives also said on Tyco's conference call the forecast might be conservative, and Tyco shares recovered after initially selling off. They closed up 18 cents, or 0.5 percent, at $39.29 on the New York Stock Exchange. Tyco reported net earnings of $266 million, or 53 cents per share, for the fourth quarter ended September 24, compared with $205 million, or 43 cents per share, a year earlier. Profit from continuing operations, excluding items, was 74 cents a share, 8 cents ahead of Wall Street estimates, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales were up 4 percent at $4.49 billion, slightly ahead of Wall Street forecasts. Tyco stands to benefit in the next few years as a recovering U.S. economy lifts commercial construction and the housing market, said Kent Croft, co-manager of the Croft Value Fund, which owns about 176,000 of the company's shares. When CEO Ed Breen took over in 2002 from now-jailed former chief Dennis Kozlowski, "people thought he was walking into a hornet's nest," Croft said. "He has done a good job turning this company around. It's good to see the company doing better from a revenue standpoint." Tyco's biggest unit, ADT Worldwide, which provides security systems and services, posted revenue of $1.95 billion, up 8 percent, but operating income jumped 24 percent. Tyco cited cost cuts and its acquisition of Broadview Security. The ADT unit, which Tyco said will show fourth-quarter sales of about $2 billion, competes with portions of Honeywell International ( HON.N ) and United Technologies ( UTX.N ). Tyco, which rejoined the S&P 500 index this year  .SPX , has been remaking its portfolio of businesses since the 2007 spinoff of its electronics business ( TEL.N ) and Covidien healthcare unit ( COV.N ). It paid $1.9 billion for Brink's Home Security holdings and has divested its European waterworks business. Covidien earnings also topped analyst forecasts on Tuesday.
