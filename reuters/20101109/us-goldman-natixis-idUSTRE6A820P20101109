 LONDON  (Reuters) - Wall Street heavyweight Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) and French rival Natixis ( CNAT.PA ) settled a spat over credit default swaps (CDS) on Tuesday in a legal row that highlights a rising tide of litigation between banks. 

 Anthony Grabiner, representing Goldman Sachs, told a UK court the two sides had settled their differences but commercial terms of the deal would remain secret. "Goldman Sachs International (the London subsidiary of Goldman Sachs) and Natixis are pleased to announce that they have agreed commercial terms to settle the dispute between them," Grabiner told the court on the first day of the scheduled trial. "The terms of the settlement are confidential and the parties will not be making any further public statement or comment in relation to this matter," he added. Natixis declined to comment in Paris. The dispute centered on whether Natixis, majority owned by France's second-largest retail bank BCPE, could lawfully terminate three credit default swaps bought by Goldman Sachs International. Natixis, which reports third-quarter results later on Tuesday, wanted to terminated the deals, alleging Goldman had not complied with the contract. Goldman, which denied the claim, was also seeking damages for breach of contract. Some lawyers expect a wave of banking and financial disputes before English courts to continue next year as banks try to extract themselves from agreements struck before the financial crisis. "The conditions that traditionally cause a turn in the cycle away from litigation are not yet present," noted Allen & Overy, a London law firm. "A faltering recovery in the rich economies and tight credit conditions may still create problems for debt-laden deals from the height of the last cycle, and the pressures on investors and multinationals to pursue yields and profit in higher risk emerging markets are likely to increase."
