 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Qantas Airways is reviewing the way it operates its A380 planes after last week's engine blowout, a source said on Tuesday, amid reports that it worked its Rolls-Royce engines harder than other airlines. 

 The Australian carrier operates its A380 engines at higher thrust levels, which could result in resonating vibrations that cause oil lines to crack, The Australian newspaper said. Qantas A380s use a higher maximum thrust setting on some take-offs on long-haul routes between Los Angeles, Sydney and Melbourne than other operators such as Singapore Airlines, the daily said. However, the extra thrust setting of 72,000 pounds remained 3,000 pounds below the engine's design limits, it added. An airline source said Tuesday the way it operated the engines was part of a wider review following last Thursday's engine failure over Indonesia which forced the aircraft to make an emergency landing in Singapore. Qantas declined to comment on the report. Chief Executive Alan Joyce said on Monday that its engines had a "slightly higher level of power" than those used in Singapore Airlines or Lufthansa planes, but they were certified to operate at those levels. Qantas said on Monday it would ground its six A380 aircraft until at least Thursday as investigations continued. Qantas shares were 0.4 percent firmer at A$2.81 at 2350 GMT. The stock initially fell after the scare but now trades less than 2 percent below where it was before last Thursday's incident. The airline was hit with a further setback on Monday night when a violent storm grounded some flights out of Sydney airport. A Qantas spokeswoman said three international flights were diverted, 13 domestic flights canceled and seven diverted. Qantas, which last week said an engine design flaw could be to blame, said on Monday it was investigating oil leaks that might have caused the engine explosion on a Sydney-bound flight.
