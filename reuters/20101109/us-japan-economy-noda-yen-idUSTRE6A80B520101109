 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda reiterated on Tuesday that he will continue to take decisive steps on currencies when necessary. 

 "Our stance remains unchanged" on currency policy, Noda told a lower house budget committee when asked by an opposition lawmaker about the impact of the yen's rise on Japan's economy. The dollar was trading around 80.80 yen on Tuesday, still within sight of its 1995 record low of 79.75 yen. (Reporting by  Tetsushi Kajimoto ; Editing by  Michael Watson )
