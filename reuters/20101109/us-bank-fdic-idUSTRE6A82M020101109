 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Large banks would be required to pay more into the government fund used to cover the cost of seizing failed banks, according to a regulatory staff proposal released on Tuesday. 

 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp board will vote on the staff proposal Tuesday morning. The change is mandated by the new financial regulatory reform law that was enacted in July. The law requires the agency to base the assessments it charges for its deposit insurance fund on, essentially, a bank's total liabilities rather than on the amount of deposits held by an institution. The result is that some large banks, those that primarily rely on funding other than from deposits, will pay more. FDIC staff said large banks, those with more than $10 billion in assets, currently make up 70 percent of the assessment base and under the proposed rule they would make up 80 percent. Community banks lobbied for the change during consideration of the reform law in Congress arguing large banks pose more of a risk to the financial system and should therefore contribute more to the fund. The proposed rule will be open for public comment for 45 days. It would go into place on April 1, meaning the change would impact what banks are charged in the second quarter of next year.
