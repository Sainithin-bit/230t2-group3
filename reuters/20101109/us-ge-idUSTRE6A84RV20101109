 BOSTON  (Reuters) - General Electric Co's ( GE.N ) healthcare arm can grow operating profit at 10 percent per year over the long term, its top executive said. 

 The largest U.S. conglomerate has also seen U.S. demand for medical equipment and services pick up following passage of the landmark U.S. healthcare reform law, according to a top executive said. "The U.S. has snapped back," said John Dineen, president and CEO of GE Healthcare. That marked a change from a sharp slowdown in spending during the debate over healthcare reform, he said. "The fact that the rules could change, ... coupled with an economic recession, really slowed down the U.S. market," Dineen told investors. GE expects its long-term healthcare revenue to grow at an annual rate of 5 to 10 percent, with operating profit rising about 10 percent per year, Dineen said. The biggest risk to that plan is the uncertain global economic environment, he said. "We don't know what's going to happen with economies, and anyone that tells you they know what's going to happen with economies doesn't know what they're talking about," Dineen said. GE expects to generate $3.5 billion in revenue in emerging markets this year, the company said in slides posted to its website for the presentation. Profit at GE Healthcare rose 15 percent to $1.74 billion through the first nine months of 2010, with revenue up 4 percent to $11.79 billion. GE no longer provides investors with numeric profit forecasts, instead offering a "framework" of how it expects its various businesses to perform. The company plans to brief investors on its 2011 expectations for the full company next month. Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE last month agreed to acquire cancer diagnostics company Clarient Inc CLRT.O in a $580 million deal. The healthcare unit "could be more aggressive" on the takeover front over the next year, Dineen said. "We're really looking at various technologies in the portfolios," he said, adding that the company sees many opportunities in the molecular diagnostics industry. GE got its start in the healthcare industry making imaging devices, from X-rays to CT-Scan machines that doctors use to peer inside patients without cutting them open. Today its operations range from developing diagnostic tests to consulting hospitals on how to operate more efficiently and it competes with major global conglomerates including Siemens AG ( SIEGn.DE ) and Philips Electronics NV ( PHG.AS ). For the past three years, GE's healthcare unit has been part of the conglomerate's Technology Infrastructure division, alongside its jet engine and railroad locomotive division, and reporting to Vice Chairman John Rice. Starting January 1, Dineen and the heads of the two other units will begin reporting directly to GE Chief Executive Jeff Immelt, with Rice moving to Hong Kong to take over leadership of GE's international operations.
