 BANGALORE  (Reuters) - Auto lender General Motors Financial Company reported a quarterly profit that nearly doubled from last year, helped by a 23 percent drop in expenses. 

 For the September quarter, net income was $51 million, up from $ 26 million in the year-ago quarter. The wholly owned subsidiary of automaker General Motors said net charge-offs were 5.4 percent of average finance receivables for the quarter, compared with 8.4 percent last year. Revenue fell 10 percent to $372.6 million, while expenses declined to $282 million, from $367 million in the prior year. The company incurred $30 million in costs during the quarter related to its takeover by General Motors Co. Earlier this year, General Motors acquired the company -- then known as AmeriCredit Corp in a $3.5 billion deal. (Reporting by  Brenton Cordeiro  in Bangalore)
