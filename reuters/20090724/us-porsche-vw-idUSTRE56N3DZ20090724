 HAMBURG  (Reuters) - Representatives of the families that own Porsche ( PSHG_p.DE ) are set to take up seats on Volkswagen's ( VOWG.DE ) supervisory board vacated by former Porsche Chief Executive Wendelin Wiedeking and his finance chief Holger Haerter, sources close to Volkswagen said Friday. 

 Haerter and Wiedeking resigned from Porsche Thursday, creating vacancies on the supervisory board of VW, Europe's largest auto maker. Porsche Chairman Wolfgang Porsche is set to enter the steering committee of the Volkswagen supervisory board, the sources said. His cousin Hans Michel Piech and Oliver Porsche, another relative, are also seen as potential candidates for the Volkswagen supervisory board, they said. Michael Macht, who has succeeded Wiedeking as Porsche, will not take up a seat on VW's supervisory board, the sources said. Volkswagen and Porsche declined to comment.
