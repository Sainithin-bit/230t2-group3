 (Reuters) - Nortel Networks Corp's wireless business goes on the auction block on Friday, marking the first of the insolvent company's three key units to be put up for sale. 

 At least three formal bids have been submitted, ranging from $650 million to $730 million. Nortel, which filed for bankruptcy protection on January 14, will later auction its corporate communications equipment unit. Here are some key facts about the auction (figures are in U.S. dollars): WHEN: Starting at 9:30 a.m. New York time WHAT'S FOR SALE: Nortel's CDMA and LTE wireless technology businesses, which include the network infrastructure equipment switches and gear, and some patents. CDMA is a wireless technology widely used in the United States. Long term evolution (LTE) is an emerging high-speed wireless technology that many of the world's biggest operators have said they would use for future network upgrades. AUCTION CHRONOLOGY Bids were due in on Tuesday, July 21. Nortel will announce the auction winner and other participants as soon as there is a clear result. A U.S. court will hear any objections to the bidding process on July 28. A Canadian court will hear objections, if any, on July 30. WHO'S IN THE RUNNING AND WHAT ARE THEY BIDDING? There are at least three formal bidders who have announced intentions to bid for the wireless assets: * Nokia Siemens Networks announced a $650 million, "stalking horse" bid last month, effectively setting the floor for bids. * MatlinPatterson, a private U.S. equity firm and Nortel creditor, announced a $725 million bid this week. * Sweden's Ericsson also submitted a bid this week and newspaper reports said it was valued at $730 million. * Canada's Research in Motion says it is actively pursuing the assets and is in talks with stakeholders to find a way for a "generous" offer to be considered. Earlier in the week the BlackBerry maker complained Nortel had effectively blocked an approach valued at $1.1 billion. OTHER NORTEL ASSETS Nortel's operations are divided about equally among the wireless business, the enterprise unit, which builds corporate networks, and the Metro Ethernet Networks unit, which makes Internet infrastructure and includes its optical and carrier ethernet technology. Nortel agreed earlier this month to sell its enterprise unit to Avaya Inc for $475 million but said higher bids may emerge. The company hopes to reach stalking horse sale agreements for its third remaining unit before the end of the quarter.
