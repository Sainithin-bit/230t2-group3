 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - AMR Corp AMR.N, parent of American Airlines, said on Friday it would raise by $5 the fee it charges to check a first or second bag on domestic flights. 

 The new charges apply to tickets purchased on or after August 14. The higher fees will extend to American's regional partner American Eagle. The fee to check a single bag will be $20, and the fee to check a second bag will be $30. U.S. airlines, struggling to bolster revenue, have begun charging fees for items and services that used to be complimentary. Earlier this week, Continental Airlines CAL.N said it would raise its checked bag fee on domestic routes by $5, effective August 19, and said that other initiatives to raise revenue would follow. AMR shares were up 8.16 percent at $4.64 in late trade on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by Kyle Peterson; Additional reporting by  Deepa Seetharaman )
