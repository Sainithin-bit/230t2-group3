 TORONTO  (Reuters) - Canadian Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said on Friday it was right for Research in Motion co-Chief Executive Jim Balsillie to ask the Canadian government to take a close look at the sale of Nortel Networks Corp. 

 "I think he (Balsillie) is a great Canadian and he's entirely right to ask for the government to be concerned about the issue. Now, after that, I leave it to the minister ... with respect to what action the government can take," he told reporters in Toronto. "What we want to see is a level playing field. We don't want to see anyone excluded from the process with respect the sale of the assets of Nortel." Canadian officials have begun researching whether and what kind of foreign purchases of Nortel Networks assets might be subject to government restrictions, Industry Minister Tony Clement said on Thursday.
