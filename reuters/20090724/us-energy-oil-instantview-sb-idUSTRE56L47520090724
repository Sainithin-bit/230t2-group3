 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. crude inventories fell slightly less than expected last week while gasoline and distillates showed smaller than expected builds, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration released on Wednesday. 

 Refinery utilization fell by 2.1 percent to 85.8 percent of capacity, more than drops forecast by analysts. Oil futures prices traded down $1.04 to $64.57 a barrel after the data was released. <O/N> HIGHLIGHTS FROM EIA REPORT (In million barrels) - Crude -1.8 (forecast -2.1) - Distillate +1.2 (forecast +1.5) - Gasoline +0.8 (forecast +0.8) - Refinery utilization -2.1 pt (forecast -0.4) HIGHLIGHTS FROM TUESDAY'S API REPORT (In mln barrels) - Crude +3.1 - Distillate +0.147 - Gasoline +1.3 ANALYST COMMENTS MIKE ZAREMBSKI, SENIOR COMMODITIES ANALYST, OPTIONSXPRESS, CHICAGO: "This is almost completely different from what API had said on crude, but in line with analyst expectations." "Almost all the crude draw was from the West Coast, which was a little unusual. Usually we see the draws in the Gulf Coast." "One big question is what happened to all that crude given refinery rates are down? We may start to hear some stories about more traders trying to take this oil offshore in tankers again to play the contango." JIM RITTERBUSCH, PRESIDENT, RITTERBUSCH & ASSOCIATES, GALENA, ILLINOIS "The crude numbers provided a sharp contrast to the API's reported crude build of 3.1 million barrels. However, the refinery run cut of around 2 percent of capacity was consistent with the APIs and provides bearish implications to the crude market. "The lack of build in Cushing supplies provided a minor supportive consideration to the curve. Meanwhile, the product stock builds proved closer to average industry expectations than was the case with the APIs. "Overall, there were no major surprises in this report. Nonetheless, the more supportive EIA guidance reduces the possibility of the oil decoupling from the financials. From here, today's trends in the equities and currencies should largely determine price direction through the balance of today." MARK KELLSTROM, ANALYST, STRATEGIC ENERGY RESEARCH AND CAPITAL LLC, SUMMIT, NEW JERSEY - "Overall, it's neutral. Our opinion is distillate stocks are going to be slowly worked off, between OPEC discipline and declines in production from other places, notably Mexico, and demand in Asia. You'll slowly work down the surplus relative to the five-year average. The other story out there is just overall efforts of the refining industry to lower capacity." GENE MCGILLIAN, ANALYST FOR TRADITION ENERGY, STAMFORD, CONNECTICUT "The data is pretty neutral. Refiners are trying to protect their margins by whacking down the utilization rates, but although these were down by 2 percent, we still saw a build in distillates and gasoline. I think we'll go back to oil prices tracking equities now. Demand isn't supporting higher crude prices." ANTOINE HALFF, FIRST VICE PRESIDENT OF RESEARCH, NEWEDGE GROUP IN NEW YORK CITY "There's a balance of very low imports and very low crude throughputs, which tells us that the market remains very weak in terms of demand." But refiners are very disciplined in not running their plants too hard and keeping runs pretty low and trying to minimize the product yields. Distillate production is weighing on refining activity, even though the build is slightly lower than five-year average, despite extremely subdued demand. No message other than we're still in recession and operators are trying to adjust."
