 TORONTO  (Reuters) - Nortel Networks Corp, once a proud symbol of Canada's technological prowess, is poised on Friday to take a big step in its own dismantling as an auction for its wireless assets draws to a conclusion. 

 The auction, which comes after a decade of decline for Nortel, has stirred nationalist passions and a spirited competition among bidders for assets whose appeal appears to have been magnified by the process. First on the block are Nortel's prized CDMA and LTE wireless technology assets, the latter of which includes technology coveted by the world's leading telecom-equipment makers. The assets may provide the key to the next generation of wireless transmission, perhaps enabling cell phones to replicate the speed and richness of broadband when the technology is fully developed. The outcome, expected to be made public any time from Friday through the weekend, is not easy to predict and the possibility of Canadian government intervention increases the uncertainty. There are three known bidders, as well as a potential maverick approach from Canada's Research in Motion, the maker of one of the world's most popular mobile phones, the BlackBerry. Following are scenarios that could unfold with the auction process: CLEAR WINNER: A clear winner could emerge among the formal bidders. Nokia Siemens Networks, a joint venture between Finland's Nokia and Germany's Siemens, last month submitted a $650 million "stalking horse" bid for the assets, setting a floor price for the assets. MatlinPatterson, a private U.S. equity firm and a Nortel creditor, announced a $725 million bid this week, while Sweden's Ericsson submitted an offer that the Globe and Mail newspaper said was valued at $730 million. RIM TEAMS WITH STAKEHOLDERS Research in Motion, which claims it was blocked by Nortel from making a bid valued at some $1.1 billion earlier this week, could team up with stakeholders to make its offer stick. The Waterloo, Ontario-based BlackBerry maker said late on Thursday it was still pursuing Nortel's wireless assets, and is in talks with the telecom gear maker's stakeholders to ensure its "generous" offer is considered. RIM did not specify the identity of stakeholders, but analysts believe it was referring to MatlinPatterson, a bondholder that has also expressed an interest in the rest of Nortel's assets. CANADIAN GOVERNMENT INTERVENES, SUPPORTS RIM BID The rules of the game could change radically if Canada's government steps in and stops the sale on the grounds the assets are strategic to national security. In doing so, Ottawa could support a bid by RIM, now Canada's most prominent technology company. Ottawa has very seldom intervened in deal-making in the past, but last year the federal government for the first time blocked the sale of a domestic company to a foreign buyer. The deal in question was the proposed $1.33 billion sale of MacDonald Dettwiler and Associates' satellite technology business to U.S.-based Alliant Techsystems Inc, halted because Canada feared losing control of top-secret satellite images. In the case of Nortel, the government has said it will let the courts decide the fate of RIM's blocked bid, although Industry Minister Tony Clement said Canadian officials are researching whether government restrictions apply to foreign purchases of Nortel assets. Canadian Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said on Friday it was right for RIM to ask the Canadian government to take a close look at the sale of Nortel.
