 BANGALORE  (Reuters) - Fortune Brands Inc FO.N reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit on Friday, bolstered by cost cuts, but the consumer products maker trimmed the top end of its full-year outlook. 

 The maker of Moen faucets, Jim Beam bourbon and Titleist golf equipment said net income was $99.8 million, or 66 cents a share, in the second quarter, compared with $136.0 million, or 88 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned 70 cents a share. Analysts on average were expecting 63 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Net sales fell 17 percent to $1.74 billion. For 2009, the company cut the top end of its earnings outlook to $2.30 a share from $2.50, while keeping the low end at $2.00. (Reporting by  Dhanya Skariachan  in Bangalore; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
