 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - China's Minmetals Resources Ltd ( 1208.HK ) has decided not to pursue its planned bid for Equinox Minerals EQN.TO, after Canada's Barrick Gold Corp ( ABX.N ) trumped its original offer, the Chinese company said in a statement on Tuesday. 

 Minmetals also said it owned a stake of around 4.2 percent in Equinox. (Reporting by  Denny Thomas ; Editing by  Jonathan Hopfner )
