 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Canada's Barrick Gold Corp ( ABX.TO ) ( ABX.N ) said on Tuesday it would take a "wait and see" approach if a higher bid emerges for its offer to pay C$7.3 billion ($7.68 billion) for Equinox Minerals EQN.TO EQN.AX. 

 Barrick on Monday made a bid for Equinox, pitting the world's largest gold miner against China's Minmetals Resources ( 1208.HK ) in a battle for copper assets. Barrick offered to buy Equinox for C$8.15 a share, an 8.7 percent premium over its Thursday closing price. The all-cash bid is 16 percent higher than the C$6.3 billion offer made by Minmetals earlier this month. "We put what we think is a fair offer on the table," said Barrick Chief Executive Aaron Regent in telephone conference with reporters. When asked what Barrick would do if a higher bid emerged, Regent said the company would "wait and see." He said Barrick would use about half of the $4 billion in cash they have on their balance sheet to fund the deal. Equinox, a global miner listed in Canada and Australia, owns the Lumwana mine in Africa's rich Zambian copper belt and most of the Jabal Sayid project in Saudi Arabia.
