 CORDOBA, Spain  (Reuters) - Euro zone interest rates are unusually accommodative and people should expect cheap money to come to an end, a European Central Bank policymaker said on Tuesday, boosting expectations of further rate hikes. 

 But ECB Executive Board member Jose Manuel Gonzalez-Paramo also said the bank had not decided to embark on a cycle of interest rate increases. "The signs are that the times of cheap money are coming to an end," Gonzalez-Paramo said. "This message should reach the private sector, businesses, and governments: that the times of abnormally accommodative rates could be coming to an end." However, he did not give any specifics of when this might happen. Earlier at the same event, he told reporters that when the ECB raised interest rates by 25 basis points to 1.25 percent earlier this month, it did not signal the start of a series of rate hikes. "The rate decision is taken each month on the data available and the same will be done next month," he added. Asked about market expectations that the ECB will increase its key interest rate twice more this year, Gonzalez-Paramo said: "We don't comment on what markets think -- markets do their job and we do ours." Two-thirds of the 62 economists polled by Reuters after the April rate hike, which until last month would have shocked markets, expect another rise by July at the latest. <ECB/INT> ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet said earlier on Tuesday that inflation expectations had not become "un-anchored" despite recent spikes in oil and commodity prices, but noted risks "here and there" of second-round effects -- higher oil prices seeping into wages and other prices. The ECB seeks to keep euro zone inflation at below, but close to 2 percent. Inflation rose to 2.7 percent last month, though analysts expect it to start falling soon. Gonzalez-Paramo also said that Greece has to stick to its EU/IMF aid plan and that restructuring of its debt could cause bigger market turmoil than the fall of Lehman Brothers did. "A restructuring would have legal and systemic consequences, that are difficult to calculate right now, but would in all probability be bigger than after the collapse of Lehman Brothers," he said. "A restructuring would affect the balance sheets of banks, of the entire system to be able to recapitalize the banking system and hit confidence." Greece was committed to economic reforms, Gonzalez-Paramo added. (Reporting by Nigel Davies, writing by Sakari Suoninen; editing by Catherine Evans/Ruth Pitchford)
