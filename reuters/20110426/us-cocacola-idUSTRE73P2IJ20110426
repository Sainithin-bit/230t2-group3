 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co's ( KO.N ) quarterly results slightly missed Wall Street estimates, as the earthquake in Japan and the timing of marketing expenses overshadowed strong sales volume, and its shares fell 1.7 percent. 

 In addition, the world's largest soft-drink maker saw less of a benefit than expected from price increases and its margins suffered, according to UBS analyst Kaumil Gajrawala. "We characterize first-quarter results as slightly disappointing, given consistent 'beats' over the last few years," Gajrawala said. He added that year-ago comparisons are also set to become more difficult as 2011 progresses, due to last year's World Cup, discounting at Wal-Mart, and generally warm weather. "We believe this could present a near-term challenge to Coca-Cola shares given the company's premium to the sector." Coca-Cola, a component of the Dow Jones Industrial average  .DJI , which many investors own for its exposure to emerging markets, saw its shares jump 10 percent since mid-March when a beverage industry newsletter reported that Diet Coke overtook Pepsi-Cola as the No. 2 soda in the United States last year behind Coca-Cola. With a price-to-earnings ratio of 17.6, according to Reuters data, it trades at a premium to rivals PepsiCo Inc ( PEP.N ) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc ( DPS.N ), which both trade between 14 and 15 times estimated earnings. The soft drink sector median is 16.6, according to Reuters data. Coca-Cola shares were down $1.16 at $66.58 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Gary Bradshaw, a portfolio manager with Hodges Capital Management in Dallas, said the dip made the stock attractive. "With the stock down, I'd be more of a buyer looking out long-term," Bradshaw said. Coke said on Tuesday that net income rose to $1.9 billion, or 82 cents per share, in the first quarter, from $1.61 billion, or 69 cents per share, a year earlier. Earnings per share were reduced by 1 cent because of lost revenue in Japan following the earthquake in March and a penny from the timing of marketing expenses as the company conforms its newly acquired bottling business to its accounting schedule. Excluding those items and restructuring and other charges, earnings were 86 cents per share, missing the average analyst estimate by a penny, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Coke expects work interruptions in Japan to shave 2 cents to 4 cents per share off its full-year earnings, as the company does not expect Japanese bottlers to be able to meet the full demand during the upcoming summer selling season. But the weak U.S. dollar is expected to boost full-year operating income by a low- to mid-single-digit percent rate, it said. Net operating revenue rose 40 percent in the quarter to $10.52 billion, in part because of last year's acquisition of North American bottling operations. Analysts on average were expecting $10.57 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Worldwide volume rose 6 percent in the quarter, with North American volume, excluding new cross-licensed brands such as Dr Pepper, up 2 percent. Sales volume rose 7 percent in Latin America, 1 percent in Europe, 8 percent in Eurasia and Africa and 5 percent in the Pacific region. Coke bought its North American bottling operations in October to streamline its distribution system and cut costs. PepsiCo Inc ( PEP.N ), which bought its bottlers earlier in the year, will report quarterly results on Thursday.
