 ROME (Reuters) -- Bank of Italy Governor Mario Draghi is known to some colleagues as "Signor Altrove," or Mr Somewhere Else - a reference to a habit of trying to be in two places at once that encapsulates both his abilities and his ambition. 

 At international summits, according to one European policymaker, he's known as 'Where's Mario' because "whenever you need him he has disappeared" to talk to some other official or on his cellphone. Soon, the 63-year old central banker and president of the Financial Stability Board might be more readily tracked down in the European Central Bank tower in Frankfurt. Tuesday's declaration of support from French President Nicolas Sarkozy leaves Draghi looking an overwhelming favorite to take over at the ECB when current President Jean-Claude Trichet steps down in October. If he succeeds, it will be the culmination of a long career in which he has established a position as the most respected Italian in international economic and political circles, belying his country's poor reputation for financial management. "Of the possible candidates, he is the one who is most like Trichet in the sense of having the capability to reach consensus within the (ECB) Governing Council," said Unicredit analyst Marco Valli. A track record of monetary prudence since joining the ECB's ratesetting body in 2006 suggests the euro zone's other heavyweight, Germany, will follow France's lead and offer the vote of confidence that would all but guarantee Draghi gets the job. "I don't think the easy conclusion that the ECB is going to be less focused on price stability, on low inflation is correct," said Societe Generale economist Klaus Baader. "Draghi has turned out lately to be one of the more hawkish members of the Governing Council." He was a lynchpin of the Italian Treasury in the early 1990s when Italy was forced out of the European exchange rate mechanism, devalued its currency and faced the real possibility that it would be unable to join the European monetary union. "When we were on the brink of a debt default in September 1992, I remember saying 'It feels like we're falling from a very high skyscraper,'" recalls Francesco Giavazzi, a fellow Italian economics professor, who has often worked with Draghi since they studied together at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the 1970s. "He answered: 'Well maybe we'll find a net under us before we hit the ground.' "He was sure our deficit- and debt-cutting program would satisfy the markets, and in the end he was right." SUPER MARIO A former economics professor who has taught at Harvard and worked at the World Bank and with investment bank Goldman Sachs, Draghi is also at the center of efforts to overhaul the global banking system as head of the Financial Stability Board. The FSB is currently tasked with driving financial market regulators to coordinate and prevent banks and other financial institutions from needing taxpayer-funded bailouts as Bear Stearns, AIG, Lloyds TSB and a host of others did in 2008. As an economics professor, Draghi advised more than one of Italy's revolving-door governments in the early 1980s, before going to Washington for six years as an executive director at the World Bank. On his return in 1990, he worked briefly at the Bank of Italy as advisor to Governor Carlo Azeglio Ciampi before heading back to the Treasury in the key post of director general, a job he kept for 10 years. In this period he overhauled the Treasury's internal structures, rewrote Italian takeover rules, and spearheaded one of the largest privatization drives ever undertaken in Europe. He was central to Italy's bid to join the first wave of euro currency participants, helped draft the Maastricht Treaty which set the ground rules of the new currency, and headed the committee which prepares the agenda for monthly meetings of economy and finance ministers. Such was his frenetic activity at the Treasury that the Italian media dubbed him "SuperMario." "Draghi is exceptionally smart, he's incredibly focused when he makes a commitment and, contrary to his cold public image, he is also very good with people and has a lively sense of humor," says a central bank colleague. A fluent English speaker, Draghi also wins wide praise among the 60-odd central bankers, Treasury officials and regulators from the 20 countries on the FSB. "He has the ability to address problems analytically, to look at the problems rather than the people around the problems which many policymakers do not have," Giavazzi says. "The fact he has both policymaking and market experience is also unusual. There are not many policymakers who have direct experience of how a trading desk works." Such qualities may help Draghi if he follows Trichet. Even if he did not get the ECB post, his role at the FSB would keep him busy. Besides the politically fraught task of establishing a list of the world's banks genuinely considered too big to fail, the FSB has the daunting job of driving unprecedented reforms through an extremely divergent group of countries in the G20. Draghi is not universally loved. Italian Economy Minister Giulio Tremonti, who often takes a dismissive view of unelected officials in positions of power, is one of the central banker's most outspoken critics. Tremonti blames the financial crisis at least in part on the technocrats Draghi oversees. Politicians, and not officials, should be the ones rewriting the rules governing global finance, Tremonti has said. However, after years of sniping he surprised commentators last year by finally praising the FSB's work, signaling that he was ready to back his central bank chief as the ECB race intensified. After four years as a Goldman Sachs vice-president from 2002-5, Draghi returned to Italy to take over the top job at the Bank of Italy from Antonio Fazio, who had been forced out by a corruption scandal. His international standing and open, outward-looking approach were refreshing after Fazio's parochialism and closed management style which had sapped the morale of staff at the central bank. "The Bank of Italy's prestige was in tatters after Fazio and I thought it would take a generation to restore it, but then this guy arrives with his smiling face and turned everything around in a few months," says one senior Bank of Italy official. WELL CONNECTED The son of a bank executive, Draghi had a comfortable upbringing in Rome before both his parents died prematurely, leaving him orphaned in his mid-teens along with his younger brother and sister. The children were brought up by an aunt and Draghi was taken under the wing of Federico Caffe, a prominent Italian economist and university professor. A scholarship student at the MIT in the early 1970s, he studied under Nobel prize winner Franco Modigliani and Stanley Fischer, now Israel's central bank governor. He also forged friendships with Larry Summers, who went on to be U.S. Treasury Secretary, and the celebrated German economist Rudy Dornbusch, who died in 2002. His summit colleagues who wonder where he is say it often turns out to be current U.S. Treasury secretary Timothy Geithner on the other end of Draghi's cellphone. Married with two children and a grandfather, Draghi has a reserved family life and is seldom seen on Rome's social scene among the other political and business elite. Nonetheless, he is a fastidious dresser: he buys all his shirts from the same tailor and, no matter how cold the weather, is never seen in public with a coat over his impeccable, black, tailor-made suits. In his dress sense, if nothing else, he is very Italian. (Additional reporting by  Huw Jones  and  Sakari Suoninen ; Editing by  Sara Ledwith ,  Simon Robinson  and John Stonestreet)
