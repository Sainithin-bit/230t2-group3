 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Co is recalling 51,000 Tundra pick-up trucks for the model year 2011 due to a potential defect in the rear drive shaft. 

 The company estimates that that 0.05 percent of the vehicles recalled may have a component-- a slip yoke-- that could break because of improper casting. There has been one slip yoke failure, but no injuries or accidents linked to the problem, Toyota said. (Reporting by  Deepa Seetharaman ; Editing by  Derek Caney )
