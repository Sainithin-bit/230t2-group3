 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Coach Inc ( COH.N ) warned investors that the disasters in Japan would continue to hurt quarterly results, casting a shadow on the upscale handbag maker's better-than-expected sales and earnings report. 

 The company said on Tuesday that it had benefited from double-digit percentage gains in China, now its main focus in Asia, and at North American stores open at least a year in the third quarter ended on April 2. Still, the company, known for its signature handbags, said the March 11 earthquake in Japan and the tsunami and nuclear disaster that followed were taking a toll. It derived about 18 percent of its sales from that country last year. Coach estimated the sales impact at $20 million, or 2 percent, for the current quarter, which ends on July 2. The company said it expected to lose 2 cents to 3 cents per share in profit because of the Japan events. That could represent nearly 5 percent of its fourth-quarter earnings of 64 cents, based on analysts' forecasts. But Coach Chief Executive Officer Lew Frankfort told Reuters that the worst was probably over. "We don't see any long-term damage," he said. "In fact, our business has rebounded in our full-price locations." Coach operates 174 stores in Japan, seven of which are still closed. The company said it had lost $20 million in sales and 2.5 cents of earnings per share during the third quarter because of the Japan disasters. On a call with analysts, Coach said it expected same-store sales in North America to rise by a high single-digit percentage rate in the current quarter, following a 10.3 percent gain during the third quarter. Coach has positioned itself in the "affordable luxury" segment in the past two years as shoppers shifted from more-expensive items such as Hermes' ( HRMS.PA ) handbags. In the past few years, it has lowered average prices on its handbags about 10 percent by introducing new, more affordable lines and expanding its outlets. Coach shares were down 1.1 percent at $56.44 in morning trading. FOCUS ON MEN, CHINA Coach has set its sights on China and expanding its assortments for men to mitigate its exposure to Japan, which Frankfort said was a mature market that was contracting even before the disasters. Men's products now make up only about 3 percent of Coach sales, but Frankfort said the "fragmented" market for those items presented a substantial opportunity. The company opened its first men's store in New York last year and plans two more for the United States this year. Sales in China make up less than 5 percent of the company's total, but are expected to rise to 10 percent by 2014. Coach is set to open another 10 stores there in the current quarter, bringing the total to 55. Coach reported net income of $186 million, or 62 cents per share, for the third quarter, up 18 percent from $157.6 million, or 50 cents per share, a year earlier. That beat Wall Street analysts' average forecast of 60 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales rose 14 percent to $950.7 million, while analysts had expected $947.2 million. Gross margin, which measures the profitability of the goods sold, held steady at 72.8 percent. Coach raised its dividend 50 percent to an annualized 90 cents per share.
