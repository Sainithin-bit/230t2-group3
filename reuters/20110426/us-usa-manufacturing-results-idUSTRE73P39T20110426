 NEW YORK/BANGALORE  (Reuters) - A half-dozen U.S. industrial multinationals beat Wall Street earnings estimates and raised their full-year forecasts on strong performance in overseas markets and a rebound in U.S. auto and truck production, pushing share prices higher. 

 3M Co ( MMM.N ), Illinois Tool Works Inc ( ITW.N ), bearings maker Timken Co ( TKR.N ), engine maker Cummins Inc ( CMI.N ), farm equipment company Agco Corp ( AGCO.N ) and filter maker Pentair Inc ( PNR.N ) reported higher-than-expected first-quarter profits on Tuesday and said current analyst estimates are too low. "International growth has been good for these companies, especially in emerging markets," said Jeff Windau, industrials analyst at Edward Jones in St. Louis. "Most of these companies have been able to manage their costs and have been pretty successful at passing prices on, which we're a little cautious on moving forward," he said. Commodity prices remain high, but estimates coming into the quarter overestimated their impact on earnings, Windau said. Industrial and consumer goods conglomerate 3M reported higher-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by sales to emerging markets, and raised its 2011 forecast, saying sales could reach a record $30 billion. 3M gets about two-thirds of its sales outside the United States, said Eric Schoenstein, co-portfolio manager of the Jensen Portfolio, which owns 2.1 million 3M shares. "With that kind of foreign revenue base, you have a company that probably far more than anybody is taking advantage of those faster-growing economies. As those GDP numbers continue to be better than what we're putting up here in the U.S., they're able to achieve more growth." 3M's India sales jumped 30 percent this quarter, China and Hong Kong sales rose 27 percent and revenue from Brazil was up by a quarter. 3M shares, part of the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI , rose 2.1 percent to $96.12,near its best level since 2007. TRUCK MARKET REBOUND Rebounding truck production helped lift results at Illinois Tool, Timken and Cummins. Cummins, which makes diesel engines, power generation equipment and filtration systems, reported a first-quarter profit of $343 million, or $1.75 per share, compared with $149 million, or 75 cents per share, a year earlier. Cummins shares rose 7.4 percent. "Top-line growth was fantastic and we are seeing the beginning signs of a strong recovery in the North American market," Morningstar equity analyst Basili Alukos said. ITW said it expects most markets to remain strong for the rest of the year. Its results showed higher demand for welding equipment, helped by sales to makers of heavy machinery, while higher U.S. and European auto production lifted sales in its transportation segment. ITW stock was up 4.9 percent, while Agco shares rose 4.6 percent. The world's third-largest maker of tractors and combines reported market-beating results and raised its full-year outlook, citing sales in Western Europe. The U.S. farm economy is the healthiest in years as rising incomes allow farmers to pay off debt and buy machinery to meet booming demand for crops and livestock. "Demand remains strong in North and South America," Agco CEO Martin Richenhagen said. "We expect these conditions to remain positive throughout 2011." Bearings maker Timken beat forecasts by a wide margin, partly because of higher demand from off-highway, rail and heavy-truck markets. Shares rose 4.3 percent to a record high. Pentair, a maker of water filters and electrical enclosures, reported market-beating results helped by solid demand for energy-efficient products and international sales. "The slow recovery in North American markets has already been weighed into (Pentair) stock," Canaccord Genuity analyst John Quealy said. "Any improvement above that sort of muted expectation will help earnings and sentiment." Lennox reminded investors that not all is well in world economies. The maker of heat pumps, fireplaces and air conditioners showed lower residential sales and a loss for the quarter. Lennox kept its full-year profit forecast unchanged but its shares fell 5.6 percent.
