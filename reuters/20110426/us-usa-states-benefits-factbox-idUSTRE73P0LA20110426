 (Reuters) - Many states cannot afford to cover promises made to their future retirees, with the Pew Center on the States reporting on Tuesday that there is a $1.26 trillion gap between what they have pledged to pay and the amount they have set aside. Nearly half of that amount, $604 billion, is for healthcare and other benefits not included in pensions, such as life insurance. 

 Altogether, states have only covered $31 billion, or just under 5 percent, of the non-pension benefit costs, according to the Pew report. And 19 states have no money set aside. Below are those 19 states, along with their liabilities. There was no data available for Nebraska. Arkansas $1.87 billion Connecticut $26 billion Florida $3.74 billion Hawaii $10.8 billion Indiana $525 million Iowa $538 million Kansas $237 million Louisiana $11.5 billion Minnesota $1.14 billion Mississippi $728 million Montana $541 million New Jersey $66.8 billion New York $56.3 billion Oklahoma $360 million Rhode Island $788 million South Dakota $67.1 million Tennessee $1.75 billion Washington $7.62 billion Wyoming $174 million SOURCE: Pew Center on the States
