 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - A shareholder group that sued over the takeover offer for the Chicago Board of Trade's parent BOT.N by Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings CME.N said on Thursday it had reached a settlement agreement after the latest improvements to the terms of the bid. 

 The group, led by the Louisiana Municipal Employees' Retirement System (LAMPERS), had filed suit in the Delaware Chancery Court in March, claiming the CBOT's board had failed to maximize shareholder value in its proposed merger and had been aided in those breaches by CME. CBOT, in a statement, said it was not a party to a settlement. A CME spokeswoman told Reuters it had reached a settlement. A lawyer for LAMPERS, John Coffey of Bernstein Litowitz Berger and Grossman, told Reuters that a settlement had been reached that provides for "a release of CBOT and the directors and the resolution of the litigation." CME in the last month has beefed up the terms of the deal by a total of some $1.5 billion in two separate moves, the latest of which was announced on Thursday. CME has been responding to a competing takeover bid for CBOT from IntercontinentalExchange Inc. ( ICE.N )
