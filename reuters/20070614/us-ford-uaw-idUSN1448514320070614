 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) heads into a round of contract talks with its major union as the automaker seeks sweeping changes worth billions of dollars that would transform it into a strong contender, according to people familiar with the upcoming negotiations. 

 After losing a record $12.6 billion, cutting 27,000 factory jobs and borrowing against its plants, Ford sees an opportunity to emerge this fall with a new contract with the United Auto Workers. It seeks to bring its labor and manufacturing costs toward parity with profitable Japanese rivals such as Toyota Motor Corp. ( 7203.T ), they said. Such steep concessions would be unprecedented in decades of past UAW agreements with the major U.S. automakers, but analysts caution that the crisis in the industry has changed the tone and raised the stakes for all sides. "This is a totally unprecedented type of negotiation," said Dave Cole, chairman of the Center for Automotive Research, adding that it is possible that one or more auto companies could fail if the industry does not get broad-scale changes from the UAW. U.S. automakers currently carry a labor cost disadvantage of $30 to $35 an hour against Asian rivals, according to auto executives and industry experts. Ford could save $3.9 billion if it manages to cut $30 per hour in wages and benefits, Brian Johnson, an analyst with Lehman Brothers, said in a note issued on Thursday. Ford spokeswoman Marcey Evans would not comment. A UAW spokesman also declined comment. But the people familiar with Ford's position said issues ranging from the automaker's ability to hire temporary workers, absenteeism among staff, break time in factories and the job security of union workers would be on the table. This year's labor talks begin with all three U.S. automakers in crisis amid restructuring plans set to eliminate more than 80,000 factory workers. FIXED COSTS UP Officials at General Motors Corp.( GM.N ) and Chrysler Group DCXGn.DE have also made clear they need cost reduction from the UAW, but Ford's position has attracted interest as it is seen by some analysts as the weakest of the U.S. car companies. Ford, which is poised to lose its No. 2 spot in the U.S. market to surging rival Toyota, has lost more share than its rivals. It also lost an industry-worst $770 for every vehicle it sold worldwide in 2006. The automaker confirmed this week it was considering options that include a sale of its European luxury brands Land Rover and Jaguar, a perpetual money loser. Ford needs as much as a 20-percent cut in wages and benefits for hourly workers to survive, Sean McAlinden, an analyst for the Center for Automotive Research, has said. Over the last two years, Ford reduced its retiree health-care costs through a special agreement with the UAW, ratified dozens of competitive operating agreements at plants that aim to save $800 million and has marked 10 plants for closure. But despite those steps, the automaker still remains noncompetitive on its home turf. Ford's North American auto operations lost $5.5 billion last year. With Toyota sales surging, industry executives say the standard for wages and benefits is increasingly being set by foreign automakers who operate mostly without unions. For instance, the additional 16 minutes of break time per shift translates to a disadvantage of $70 per vehicle. Ford's fixed costs as a percentage of revenue was 38.1 percent in 2006, up from 24 percent in 2000, according to people familiar with matter. That compares to Toyota's 23 percent to 25 percent fixed cost ratio. Also, Ford's average factory capacity utilization at 77 percent for 2006 hovered well below GM's 93 percent and Toyota's 103 percent, which is achieved through extra shifts.
