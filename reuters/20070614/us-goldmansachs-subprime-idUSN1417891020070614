 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc. ( GS.N ) Chief Financial Officer David Viniar predicted that the U.S. subprime mortgage market, which has suffered rising defaults and generated losses for lenders over the past year, will get worse before it gets better. 

 "The subprime business continues to be weak. We have not seen the bottom in the market. There will be more pain felt by people as it works its way through system," Viniar told reporters in a conference call on Thursday. Viniar said subprime weakness contributed to the decline in fixed-income trading results for the second quarter. He added, though, that problems in the market for the riskiest home buyers still has not spread to other debt markets, as was feared earlier this year. "So far we still have not seen any contagion," he said.
