 LONDON  (Reuters) - British-based publishing and exhibitions group United Business Media Plc, which has been reducing its exposure to print in favor of online media, said it was cutting more than 200 jobs at its U.S.-based technology media business. 

 Shares in UBM were up 2.8 percent at 815-1/2 pence by 0948 GMT, to be one of the top four performing media stocks in Europe. The revamp in its U.S. CMP Technology, which has more than 20 print titles such as "Wall Street & Technology", "Planet Analog" and "Call Center Magazine" will cost around $12 million. CMP Technology currently has a headcount of around 1,150 and UBM said the cuts would be largely completed within two weeks. Three years ago, nearly three-quarters of UBM's revenue came from print activities. In 2007, UBM expects it to account for 38 percent of group revenue. UBM said in a statement on Thursday that CMP Technology was restructuring its print portfolio and that this would lead to a drop in annual revenues of $15 million while annual salary costs would be cut by more than $20 million. A number of print titles will be closed with others, such as "Network Computing" and "Optimize", merged into "Information Week". UBM CEO David Levin has been pursuing acquisitions and disposals in recent years to move the company away from print and deeper into events, online media and data-based products. Almost $150 million has been invested in CMP Technology over the last two years to rebalance its product portfolio. In the year to date, growth in its online and event revenue has offset the decline in print revenues, UBM said in the statement. CMP Technology had revenues of 186.2 million pounds in 2006, up 18.9 percent from 156.6 million the previous year -- but off 2 percent on an underlying basis when adjusted for effects that include acquisitions, disposals and discontinued operations. Bridgewell Securities analysts said the company now appears to have addressed an area of the business that was hurt hard by the bursting of the technology bubble in 2003. Numis Securities said UBM was doing well as it refocused on faster-growing events and online operations, but kept its "hold" rating due to the good run by the shares this year. Goldman Sachs raised its price target to 969 pence from 934p, while Cazenove said that given the recent outperformance in the shares against its peers, UBM was a relatively higher risk than academic and business publisher Informa ahead of UBM's trading update on June 27. Informa's update on trading is scheduled for June 29. (Additional reporting by Mike Elliott)
