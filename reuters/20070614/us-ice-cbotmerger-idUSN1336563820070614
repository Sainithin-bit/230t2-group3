 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - IntercontinentalExchange Inc. ( ICE.N ) faces an uphill battle in its pursuit of CBOT Holdings Inc. BOT.N, analysts said, a day after it raised its bid to control the parent of the No. 2 U.S. futures exchange. 

 "While ICE's bid is superior financially, we get the sense that many CBOT members and long term holders would like to go with CME, given possibly greater integration and competitive risks from CME associated with an ICE deal," Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. analysts Rob Rutschow and Scott Appleby wrote in a research note. Atlanta-based energy exchange ICE in March offered to buy the Chicago Board of Trade's parent, topping an earlier offer by Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings Inc.CME.N, the largest U.S. futures mart. Although CBOT's board has thrown its support behind a merger with CME, ICE revised the terms of its offer on Tuesday to take into account the concerns of CBOT shareholders. CBOT executives have previously said a merger with the energy options exchange would be "catastrophic" due to differences in the technologies used. Earlier this week, the U.S. Department of Justice approved the merger of CME and CBOT, saying the proposed combination would probably not hurt competition. ICE responded by revising its offer. Under the sweetened terms, CBOT shareholders would be able to elect to take up to $2.5 billion in cash instead of an all- stock deal. ICE also said it would pay the $294 million break-up fee and expenses payable to CME if CBOT agreed to partner with ICE. ICE also filed a proxy statement on Wednesday urging CBOT shareholders to vote against the CME merger, calling CME's proposal "inadequate." CREATIVE OFFER, BUT NOT ENOUGH Some analysts said the revised ICE terms, which also include greater protection for trading fees and address CBOT shareholders' concerns about integration risk, would likely be spurned by CBOT members. ICE's "creative" offer is a compelling one, but the deal will be settled on "intangibles" such as "CBOT's preference for a local deal and attitude to the CBOE settlement," said CIBC analysts Niamh Alexander and Matthew Petricone in a research note. The Chicago Board Options Exchange has said a CME-CBOT merger would invalidate the "exercise right" of full CBOT members to trade options on the CBOE without owning a membership because it would change the definition of what a "CBOT member" is. Relations between CBOE, the largest U.S. options exchange, and CBOT are already soured because of a dispute over these rights. In a lawsuit filed last year, CBOT alleged CBOE's plans to demutualize would have a negative impact on these rights. Last month, ICE reached an agreement with CBOE that would offer a total payout of $665.5 million to CBOT members for these trading rights, if ICE succeeds in getting CBOT. "It's not a simple question of economics in this member influenced shareholder vote, rather a 'hearts and minds' campaign from here," the analysts wrote in a research note. Analyst Richard Repetto of Sandler O'Neill said that, while some CBOT members may favor ICE's resolution with CBOE on this issue, others may want to continue the CBOT's court fight. Although ICE has an uphill battle in its quest to displace the CME, "the clear take away is that ICE CEO Jeff Sprecher has established himself as ... a force to be reckoned with in the exchange space," Repetto wrote in a note to clients.
