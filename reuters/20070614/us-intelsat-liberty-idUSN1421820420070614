 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Liberty Media and EchoStar Communications Corp.'s reported interest in Intelsat Ltd. points to a renaissance in the commercial satellite market that is spurred by demand for high-definition television and faster Internet services, analysts said on Thursday. 

 Liberty Media Holding Corp. LCAPA.O and EchoStar ( DISH.O ) are preparing a joint offer for Intelsat, the world's largest commercial satellite operator, which is accepting final bids on Thursday, according to the Wall Street Journal. The report comes after sources told Reuters in April that the private equity owners of Intelsat have put the company up for sale and had been approached by a potential buyer, also from the private equity industry. Analysts said investors are attracted to Intelsat because there will be a rise in demand for satellite capacity as more programmers launch high-definition TV channels. "It's reasonable to expect there will be significant demand for transponder capacity," said Craig Moffett, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein. "The hope is that demand pushes up utilization rates and bolsters pricing." The Journal said Intelsat, which has about $11.5 billion in debt, could fetch more than $5.5 billion, although there was no guarantee Liberty and EchoStar would make a formal offer. Intelsat, which has a fleet of 51 satellites, leases capacity to clients such as cable television programmers to beam their channels to the head ends of cable operators. The pairing of Liberty, which will take control of No. 1 U.S satellite TV operator DirecTV Group Inc. DTV.N this year, and EchoStar could help them diversify as competitive pressure mounts from cable TV operators. In the last two years, most major U.S cable companies have been winning subscribers by offering competitively priced packages of video, telephone and high speed Internet access. "Benefits theoretically could include revenue diversification away from an increasingly competitive consumer video business and the high cash flow generation of Intelsat," Bear Stearns analyst Spencer Wang wrote of the possible bid in a note. BROADBAND DirecTV and EchoStar have been exploring ways to jointly expand their bandwidth and could use Intelsat's capacity to provide more high-definition TV channels and possibly launch satellite-based Internet services, said analysts. "EchoStar and DirecTV have been talking about working together to achieve synergies for some time," said Todd Mitchell at Kaufman Bros. In another sign of deepening cooperation, DirecTV and EchoStar said on Thursday they would be working with Clearwire Corp. CLWR.O to offer high-speed Internet access and voice services using Clearwire's wireless high-speed network. EchoStar and Liberty Media, headed by cable pioneer John Malone, declined to comment on whether they were interested in Intelsat. Intelsat could not be reached for comment. Intelsat, which was set up as a multi-government organization in 1964 during the Cold War, was taken private in 2001 and bought by four private equity firms -- Apax Partners APAX.UL, Permira PERM.UL, Apollo Management and Madison Dearborn Partners -- in a $3.1 billion deal in August 2004. Months later, Intelsat expanded by agreeing to buy another large satellite operator, PanAmSat. Intelsat competes with Europe's SES Global SESF.LU( SESFd.PA ) and Eutelsat Communications ( ETL.PA ). Private equity firms are drawn to the satellite sector because of the companies' steady cash flows, which allow them to take on large amounts of debt to finance transactions. A tie-up between the two U.S. satellite TV broadcasters and Intelsat could also greatly reduce the high costs and risks involved in launching new satellites. News of a partnership between EchoStar and DirecTV will likely renew speculation over whether there could be an eventual attempt to merge the two operators. DirecTV and EchoStar have tried to combine, most recently in 2002, but were thwarted by U.S. federal regulators. Last August, they jointly bid in a government auction for spectrum licenses for wireless services, but eventually pulled out. DirecTV shares rose 2.71 percent to $23.48, while EchoStar stock ended flat at $44.93. Liberty Media rose 0.95 percent to  $117.76. (Additional reporting by  Franklin Paul  and  Al Yoon )
