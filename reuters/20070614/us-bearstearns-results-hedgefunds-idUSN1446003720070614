 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bear Stearns Cos. Inc., BSC.N which manages a hedge fund that has reportedly suffered big losses, expects little further impact on earnings from the fund, the company's chief financial officer said on a conference call. 

 Bear Stearns CFO Sam Molinaro said any decline in fees from the fund was reflected in results in the asset management division in the second quarter, but should not influence results in the future. Bear Stearns has little exposure to the fund, Molinaro added.
