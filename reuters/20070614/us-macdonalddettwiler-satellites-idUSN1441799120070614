 TORONTO  (Reuters) - MacDonald Dettwiler & Associates Ltd. ( MDA.TO ) denied media reports on Thursday that it was mulling the sale of its surveillance and space businesses. 

 MDA shares shot up as much as 13 percent Thursday morning on speculation it was looking to sell the business for around $1 billion. But In a brief press release, MDA dismissed reports that the company or any of its units were for sale. "(MDA) announces in response to today's articles in Wall Street Journal and the Globe and Mail that there are no discussions underway with any party to acquire MDA or any of its business units or subsidiaries," a company statement said. Shares in Richmond, British Columbia-based MDA rose as high as C$49.61 on the Toronto Stock before easing back to C$48.72 when trade was halted. Following MDA's statement, and after resuming trading, the shares fell back to C$44.95, for a gain of C$1.05. A volume of 837,000 shares easily outpaced a daily average of 180,000 over the previous five sessions. Citing unnamed sources, the Wall Street Journal had said MDA was asking for about $1 billion, and four U.S. defense contractors -- Lockheed Martin Corp. ( LMT.N ), Raytheon Co. ( RTN.N ), Northrop Grumman Corp. ( NOC.N ) and Alliant Techsystems Inc. ( ATK.N ) -- had expressed interest but opted against a bid. ($1=$1.07 Canadian)
