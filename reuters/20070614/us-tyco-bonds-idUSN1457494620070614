 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Tyco International Ltd. ( TYC.N ) said on Thursday it sees no impediments to its plan to spin off two businesses to shareholders later this month, after a group of bondholders said the plan could be delayed because it failed to fulfill obligations to debt holders. 

 Tyco is planning to spin off its electronics and health-care divisions into independent companies by the end of June. The remaining Tyco International will consist of the company's fire and security and engineered products divisions. As part of the reorganization Tyco attempted to tender for its debt, however the majority of the holders of the U.S.-denominated debt did not accept the tender, arguing that Tyco was not paying the full value of the bonds.  The bondholders said it sent a letter to Tyco's Board of Directors on Thursday stating that "Tyco failed to obtain requisite bondholder consents for the proposed break-up of the company and instead attempted, unsuccessfully, to coerce the bondholders to accept less than the full amount of money owed to them." Tyco officials, however, said they see no impediments to completing the planned separation. "We have honored our obligations to our bond holders," Tyco spokesman Paul Fitzhenry said. "We made a fair offer during the tender process and we are now proceeding to complete the separation of Tyco into three separate companies at the end of this month. "Both the Tyco board and the SEC signed off on the transaction last week and shares in the three companies began trading this morning on a 'when-issued basis,'" he added.
