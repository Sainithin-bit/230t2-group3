 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Stocks rose on Thursday as a 2 percent gain in oil prices boosted shares of Exxon Mobil Corp. ( XOM.N ) and other energy companies while data showing moderate inflation lifted optimism about the economy. 

 Exxon's stock led the major advancers in the S&P 500 as crude rose on gasoline supply concerns. A day after the biggest gain in the Dow industrials in almost a year, stocks drew support from a government report that showed a modest rise in the May Producer Price Index excluding food and energy costs. The data supported the notion inflation is in check even as the economy grows.  "What investors are starting to incorporate is the thought that the economy might be accelerating and that the first quarter truly was the worst quarter of the year," said Paul Nolte, director of investments at Hinsdale Associates, in Hinsdale, Illinois. "Investors are still interested in stocks and are willing to buy a dip in the market." The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  gained 71.37 points, or 0.53 percent, to end at 13,553.72. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  added 7.30 points, or 0.48 percent, to finish at 1,522.97. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  advanced 17.10 points, or 0.66 percent, to close at 2,599.41. Exxon shares rose 1.7 percent to $84.77 on the New York Stock Exchange. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, July crude CLN7 rose $1.39 to close at $67.65 a barrel, the highest settlement since September 5, 2006. GM CLIMBS, GOLDMAN SLIPS Shares of General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) rose 4.7 percent to $33.60 after sources said GM and bankrupt auto parts maker Delphi Corp. DPHIQ.PK are "very close" to a deal with the United Auto Workers union that would help the supplier emerge from bankruptcy. GM was the Dow's biggest gainer. On the downside, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. ( GS.N ) shares dropped 3.4 percent to $225.75 as the investment bank's quarterly earnings disappointed investors. Bear Stearns Cos. BSC.N , one of the largest U.S. mortgage bond underwriters, said quarterly profit fell by a third. Its stock ended up 0.07 percent at $149.60.  Besides energy, investors snapped up shares of transportation companies and big manufacturers, among the biggest beneficiaries of a growing economy. Plane maker Boeing Co.'s ( BA.N ) stock rose 0.5 percent to $98.97, while shares of heavy equipment maker Caterpillar Inc. ( CAT.N ) gained 1 percent to $80.73. Diversified manufacturer General Electric Co. ( GE.N ) added 0.4 percent to $37.80 on the NYSE. The Dow Jones Transportation Average .DJT was up 1.5 percent, as shares of package delivery company United Parcel Service Inc. ( UPS.N ) rose 2.5 percent to $73.95. Telecommunications company AT&T ( T.N ) was another standout, jumping 1.5 percent to $40.56 after Bear Stearns raised its price target on the stock. HSBC increased its price target on Verizon ( VZ.N ) to $50 from $43, sending the stock up 0.8 percent to $43.22. Apple Inc. ( AAPL.O ) contributed the most to the Nasdaq's gain. Apple's stock rose 1.1 percent to $118.75 on optimism about the company's iPhone, which will be sold by AT&T. Trading was moderate on the NYSE, with about 1.45 billion shares changing hands, below last year's estimated daily average of 1.84 billion, while on Nasdaq, about 2.02 billion shares traded, matching last year's daily average. Advancing stocks outnumbered declining ones by a ratio of about 2 to 1 on the NYSE and by about 3 to 2 on Nasdaq. (Additional reporting by  Ellis Mnyandu )
