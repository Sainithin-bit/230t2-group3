 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Kellogg Co., facing a lawsuit and pressure from consumer groups, on Thursday said it will only market food to children that meets certain nutritional standards. 

 The largest U.S. cereal maker said that products advertised on media for which half the audience is under 12 years old will have 200 or less calories per serving, less than 2 grams of saturated fat and no more than 230 milligrams of sodium and 12 grams of sugar.
