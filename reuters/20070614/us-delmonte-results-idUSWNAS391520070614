 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Del Monte Foods Co. DLM.N, maker of Meow Mix cat food, StarKist tuna and its own canned fruits, on Thursday posted a drop in quarterly profit, hit by higher costs for some items and lower seafood sales volume. 

 Net profit for the fourth quarter that ended April 29, fell to $36.7 million, or 18 cents per share, from $57.9 million, or 29 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.
