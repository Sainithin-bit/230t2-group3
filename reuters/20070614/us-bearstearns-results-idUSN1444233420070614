 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Investment bank Bear Stearns Cos. Inc. BSC.N, one of the nation's largest mortgage bond underwriters, said on Thursday quarterly earnings fell by a third as lower mortgage underwriting volumes cut into bond revenue and it wrote down assets at a stock-trading venture. 

 The write-down was expected but results still fell short of forecasts, and Bear Stearns shares dropped as much as 2.3 percent in early trading before rallying late in the session. Chief Executive James Cayne is adding hundreds of bankers and traders in Europe and Asia, but for now Bear Stearns earns most of its profit in the United States, where the mortgage market has been tricky. A rising number of home-owner defaults has cut into underwriting volume in the mortgage-backed market, contributing to a 21 percent decline in Bear Stearns's fixed income sales and trading revenue. "Mortgage exposure has not been a good thing recently," said Jim Huguet, co-chief executive at Great Companies Inc., which does not own Bear Stearns shares. Weakness in bond trading helped reduce net income to $361.7 million, or $2.52 a share, for the fiscal second quarter ended May 31, from $539.3 million, or $3.72 a share, a year before. Excluding a non-cash charge of $227 million, or 88 cents a share, related to the write-down of intangible assets linked to its Bear Wagner Specialists unit, second-quarter earnings were $3.40 a share. Analysts, on average, had forecast $3.49 a share on that basis, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 0.5 percent to $2.512 billion. The average forecast was $2.317 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Bear Stearns said in May it was writing down $225 million from its 2001 investment in Bear Wagner, a New York Stock Exchange floor trading firm, as electronic systems siphon more business away from human traders on the exchange floor. Concerns about U.S. mortgage exposure have weighed on Bear Stearns' shares. Since mid-February the stock has fallen 10 percent, while the Amex Securities Broker-Dealer .XBD index has risen nearly 4 percent. The shares fell as low as $146.12 early on Thursday, but rallied later as bargain-hunters swooped in, and closed up 11 cents at $149.60. TIGHTER MORTGAGE UNDERWRITING Bear Stearns tightened its mortgage underwriting standards during the quarter, which cut into volumes of new home loan securities to underwrite, Chief Financial Officer Sam Molinaro said on an investor conference call. U.S. mortgage lenders have been scaling back operations as mortgage defaults reach record levels. Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. LEH.N is merging two lending subsidiaries, which will result in some 400 layoffs. Bear Stearns also wrote down the value of some of its mortgage bonds, Molinaro said, adding the bank was likely to continue to be affected by difficulty in the mortgage market. But he said its mortgage-backed revenues rose versus the first quarter, which may signal the business has bottomed out. Market sources said Bear Stearns was looking to sell nearly $4 billion of asset-backed securities supported by subprime loans, or loans to people with shaky credit. The sale would help raise cash for a Bear Stearns-managed hedge fund potentially facing high redemptions and margin calls, according to sources. Any impact from that fund on the bottom line was limited to the second quarter, Molinaro said.
