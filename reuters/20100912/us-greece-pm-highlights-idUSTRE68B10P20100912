 THESSALONIKI, Greece  (Reuters) - Following are comments by Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou at a news conference at an annual trade fair in the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki on Sunday: 

 On debt restructuring: "Debt restructuring would be catastrophic for the economy, credibility and our future ... we would be talking about the collapse of our banking system, it would be a tragedy for households. We are not even discussing it." On weak budget revenues and new measures: "There are no new measures, only those we have agreed in the (EU/IMF) loan package of 110 billion euros ($140 billion). The slippage on revenues is near 1.5 billion euros. With the pace we are advancing and with the measures we have already taken, we are confident that we will reach the goal we have set for 2010, and this will be quite an accomplishment." On banks: "We have said that the country needs a strong state banking pillar, this policy remains. How it will morph will depend on possible mergers that may take place in the broader sector." "Our advisers have recommendations, certainly the final decision is the government's. It is always a political decision for the benefit of the economy." "The call of National Bank ( NBGr.AT ) for a share capital increase, which had very positive results not only for NBG but for the entire banking system, was a vote of confidence. Another such vote of confidence was the decision of Norway's big fund to buy Greek bonds." On former ECB Vice President Lucas Papademos: "We have a close cooperation with Lucas Papademos. We are announcing that he will take on a role as my unpaid adviser on fiscal and economic policy issues." On tax evasion: "If (all) taxpayers paid their taxes, we would not have a (EU/IMF) memorandum, we would have lower tax rates. We are trying to widen the tax base. There are more than one million Greeks with still open tax cases. These will be closed in an open and transparent way." On bond yield spreads: "It shows first of all the necessity of having a support mechanism, how useful and necessary that was. The mechanism gives us the time to show we are credible, to make changes and show we will become a competitive economy." "There is obviously fear in the markets, there's often a crowd-like sentiment and reaction. There is fear and risk relating to Greece. We are showing that we're stronger and much more capable to deal with these problems. I am confident that confidence is growing and I hope at some point, sooner rather than later, that it will have a strong impact on markets and will bring down the spreads." "2013 will mark the end of this (EU/IMF funding) procedure. The faster we implement the big changes in our country, the faster we will be able to exit the terms of the (EU/IMF) memorandum. This could happen even before 2013, if all goes well." On credibility: "Despite all the Cassandras, we have shown that we are a credible nation. Greek people are decided to make changes. The new confidence we have will bear fruit, not only in cutting down our deficit which is important to deal with our debt and our creditors, but it will also instill confidence to boost investment and turn the economy around."
