 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Market conditions are not bad enough to make Spain request any kind of financing help from the euro zone, a senior euro zone official said on Friday. 
 "If you look at the current market situation, I see no need for Spain to apply for any program. The market situation is far away from any need for a full macroeconomic program," the senior official, with knowledge of preparations for euro zone finance ministers discussions, said.
