 BERLIN  (Reuters) - A spokeswoman for the German government declined to comment on a media report on Friday that merger talks between Airbus manufacturer EADS and British defense group had practically collapsed. 
 Germany's Der Spiegel news magazine, citing German government sources, reported in its online edition that Britain, France and Germany, whose approval is necessary for the mega-merger to go ahead, had failed to agree. (Reporting by  Gernot Heller ; Writing by Michelle Martin)
