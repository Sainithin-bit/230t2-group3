 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - - A request from the Spanish government for a bailout is not imminent, a senior euro zone official said on Friday. 
 The official, with knowledge of preparations for the meeting of euro zone finance ministers due on Monday, was commenting on media reports that a request from Madrid for some form of financial help from the euro zone could come as soon as this weekend. "There has been no demand from Spain. I am quite confident that if it were to come, it is not imminent," the official said. (Reporting by  Jan Strupczewski  and  Robin Emmott )
