 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The United States has fallen into an 
"awfully pale recession" and may remain stagnant for the rest 
of the year, former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan was 
quoted on Monday saying. 

  "We're in a recession," Bloomberg news agency reported 
Greenspan had said in a television interview. "But this is an 
awfully pale recession at the moment. The declines in 
employment have not been as big as you'd expect to see."  Last week a government report showed employers shed jobs in 
April at a slower rate than had been feared, providing some 
relief about the slowing economy.  Greenspan doubted there would be an immediate recovery, 
saying stagnation for the rest of the year was the most likely 
outcome. "That's certainly the most benevolent scenario," he 
said. "It's not all that far from being the most probable."  The economy would not start turning around until home 
prices started settling and eased pressure on finance companies 
to write off mortgage-related losses, Greenspan said.  Greenspan has said before that the economy is in a 
recession, although he also said at that time that it was too 
soon to say how deep or prolonged the downturn would be. His 
office could not be reached immediately for comment.  (Reporting by  Aarthi Sivaraman ; editing by  David Stamp )
