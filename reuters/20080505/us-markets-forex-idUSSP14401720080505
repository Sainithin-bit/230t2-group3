 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar was broadly softer on Tuesday as doubts resurfaced about the health of the U.S. economy while record oil prices lifted commodity currencies like the Australian and Canadian dollars. 

 "The U.S. dollar shine following the April employment report has worn thin," said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBC Greenwich Capital. "The market seems reluctant to fully embrace the dollar." Against a basket of six major currencies, the dollar was hovering at 73.185 .DXY, having backed off a 73.698 high on Friday. In early Asian trading, the euro bought $1.5500 having recouped all the losses suffered after Friday's U.S. payrolls report proved not as weak as feared. Traders said support had been solid in the $1.5340/60 area and the market seemed to be in a mood to test resistance around $1.5570. Trade was again thin with Tokyo off on holiday for a second day, keeping the dollar subdued around 104.90 yen after failing to sustain a 105.62 high on Monday. The dip in the U.S. dollar came despite surprising strength in the ISM survey of U.S. services, which climbed to 52.0 in April from 49.6 in March, putting it above the 50 threshold that separates growth from contraction. Instead, the market chose to focus on a Federal Reserve loan officer survey showing a sharp tightening in credit conditions and reports of widespread job cuts at financial institutions. OIL SURGES The jump in oil to a fresh high of $120.36 was also seen weighing down on the U.S. economy and helped extinguish a rally in equities  .DJI . "The ISM data should've helped the U.S. dollar but didn't, as flows and negative equity sentiment dominated holiday thinned trade," said Matthew Johnson, a senior economist at broker ICAP. In contrast, record highs for oil were seen reinforcing the European Central Bank's focus on inflation, which ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet on Monday termed a "significant" risk. That merely underlined expectations the central bank would keep rates at 4 percent when it meets on Thursday. "The U.S. is going to export inflation no matter what," said Johnson. "If U.S. growth is strong, commodity prices will rise; and if growth is weak, the Fed will cut and real rates will drop further, and commodity prices will rise further." Gold and a range of other commodities did indeed climb on Monday, lifting currencies like the Australian dollar which has risen two U.S. cents in as many days to reach $0.9468. Dealers are also anticipating a hawkish tone from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) when it announces the decision of its monthly policy meeting at 2:30 p.m. (0430 GMT). The central bank is widely expected to hold its key cash rate at a 12-year high of 7.25 percent and underline its concern about core inflation, which surged to a 17-year peak of 4.2 percent in the first quarter. There are no major U.S. economic data due on Tuesday, but Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke will speak on mortgage foreclosures at 0030 GMT. (Reporting by  Wayne Cole ; Editing by James Thornhill)
