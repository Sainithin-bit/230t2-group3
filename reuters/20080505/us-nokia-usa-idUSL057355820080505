 HELSINKI  (Reuters) - Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ) is going to introduce many new phone models through U.S. carriers in coming months to grab a bigger share of the lucrative cell phone market, the Finnish phone maker said on Monday. 

 Nokia sells 40 percent of all phones sold globally, but in the United States its share has been staggering around 10 percent as the Finnish firm has dropped own production of phones using CDMA technology, popular in the U.S. Finnish daily Helsingin Sanomat quoted Nokia chief designer as saying design cooperation with U.S. operators will bear fruit soon. "In the next few months (U.S.) operators will carry a lot of new products from us," Alastair Curtis told the paper. A Nokia spokesman said the company would introduce a number of new models in the United States this year -- including CDMA phones, models tailored for the U.S. carriers and phones sold globally.
