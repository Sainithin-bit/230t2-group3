 LONDON  (Reuters) - The dollar and European stocks weakened slightly on Monday in holiday-thinned markets while euro zone government bonds rose after positions became oversold following Friday's better than expected U.S. employment data. 

 The subdued mood on equities looked set to continue in New York after Microsoft ( MSFT.O ) dropped its bid for Yahoo Inc ( YHOO.O ), clouding the outlook for mergers and acquisitions. Oil prices were on the rise again following a statement from Iran's foreign ministry that the country would not accept any package of incentives from world powers that violates its rights to develop its nuclear industry. On Friday U.S. non-farm payrolls data showing a 20,000 fall in jobs last month relieved investors who had expected a drop four times as great, boosting the dollar and shares. But markets, thinned on Monday by London's closure for a public holiday, had second thoughts and the dollar eased in Europe despite data showing euro zone investors' morale had unexpectedly weakened in May. The dollar was down 0.11 percent on the day against a basket of six major currencies .DXY at 73.375. "The jobs data was still a negative number so people have tried to reassess the data they saw last week. They realize that the worst is not over and we will still have to expect weak U.S. data so it's not the time to buy the dollar strongly," said Antje Praefcke, currency strategist at Commerzbank. European shares took a breather after last week's gains, easing after influential U.S. investor Warren Buffett said on Sunday the United States was in recession as he defines it. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index was 0.29 percent lower at 6:00 a.m. EDT. EADS ( EAD.PA ) dropped 3.35 percent after German media reported that the Airbus consortium of which it is a part could be forced to delay some deliveries of its A380 superjumbo airliner. "We had a pretty solid rally on Friday on the back of the jobs data, and with London off today, volumes are very low as nobody is willing to build any position," said Chicuong Dang, equity analyst at Richelieu Finance, in Paris. In Asia, Japan was on holiday, but in Hong Kong stocks fell from the previous session's 3-1/2 month high, closing down 0.22 percent. Yahoo shares traded down 21 percent at $22.50 ahead of the open on Wall Street after Microsoft backed away from a takeover bid when Yahoo Chief Executive Jerry Yang demanded the price be raised to $37 a share. Euro zone government bond prices rose, recouping some of their losses from Friday after the U.S. non-farm payroll figures. The yield on the interest-rate sensitive two-year Schatz was down 2.8 basis points at 3.796 percent. But Kornelius Purps, a fixed income strategist at Unicredit, warned: "The main thing is not to over-interpret price action in a thinner market." Supply disruptions in Nigeria added to the tension between Iran and the West pushed up oil prices, with U.S. light crude for June delivery 67 cents higher at $116.98 a barrel. (Editing by Ron Askew)
