 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of Yahoo Inc ( YHOO.O ) tumbled 21 percent in pre-market trade on Monday after Microsoft Corp ( MSFT.O ) withdrew its $47.5 billion takeover offer for the Internet search and media company. 

 The decline also followed Citibank's downgrade on Yahoo shares to "sell" from "buy". The stock tumbled to $22.65 on Monday morning. The shares rose nearly 7 percent to $28.67 on Friday on hopes of an agreement between Microsoft and Yahoo. (Reporting by  Franklin Paul , editing by Mark Porter)
