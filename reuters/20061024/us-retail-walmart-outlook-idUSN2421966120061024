 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) expects its sales to improve as it aggressively cuts prices this holiday season, Chief Executive Officer Lee Scott said at an analysts meeting on Tuesday. 

 Scott stressed that the retailer was not satisfied with its October performance. Sales at stores open at least a year -- or "comps" -- are tracking up about 1 percent this month, below the company's expectations for 2 percent to 4 percent growth. "I would expect that as gas prices continue to level off, and as we implement our aggressive strategy across meaningful categories in the holiday season that we will see stronger sales," Scott said. "That is our expectation. It is not our expectation to proceed with 1 percent comps."
