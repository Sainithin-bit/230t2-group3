 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - DuPont Co. ( DD.N ), the No. 2 U.S. chemicals maker, on Tuesday posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit against a year-earlier loss, helped by rising sales and higher prices, especially in its paints business. 

 The company, whose shares reached a 16-month high in early trading on Tuesday, also said it will deliver higher year-over-year earnings in the fourth quarter and expects to meet its long-term target of 10 percent annual growth in earnings per share. But the company stuck to its full-year profit forecast at $2.85 per share excluding one-time items, which fell short of some analysts' expectations. "We had to take into account slower U.S. housing and slower U.S. autos (demand)," DuPont Chairman and Chief Executive Charles Holliday Jr. said during a conference call. Analysts welcomed the earnings figures, but were surprised by the outlook. "While this was disappointing, we believe it is also conservative given the strong momentum exhibited in pricing, volumes and fixed costs productivity in the quarter," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a research note. "The guidance that they have given is pretty hedged and they have a pretty good sense of how the quarter has already shaped up." said Hassan Ahmed, analyst and senior vice president with HSBC Securities. Net income for the third-quarter was $485 million or 52 cents a share, compared with a net loss of $82 million, or 9 cents a share, in the year ago period. Excluding a benefit from insurance and other items, the company earned 49 cents per share in the most recent quarter. On average, analysts polled by Reuters Estimates had forecast earnings of 44 cents a share. MOMENTUM 'WILL CONTINUE' "Our momentum will continue into 2007 and we expect to meet our long-term financial goal of 10 percent annual growth in earnings per share," CEO Holliday said in a statement. Net sales rose 7 percent in the period to $6.3 billion, beating the Wall Street estimate by about $200 million, with double-digit increases in Asia Pacific and Europe. The chemicals company said local selling prices were higher in every region, increasing worldwide sales 3 percent. Overall sales volume increased 3 percent, reflecting higher sales of titanium dioxide, engineering and packaging polymers, industrial chemicals and electronic materials. Sales in the coatings and color technologies unit rose 8 percent, while pretax profit rose more than 10-fold to $276 million versus the year-ago quarter, which was hurt by charges related to damage from hurricanes. HSBC's Ahmed said the coatings and color technologies unit benefited from smooth titanium dioxide production and increased prices for the specialty chemical. The restructuring of operations, particularly in Europe, is also clearly helping, he added. In the year-ago period the hurricane season adversely impacted the coatings division and forced a reduction in its titanium dioxide output, one of the main contributors to earnings for this division. The increases in sales volume and prices helped DuPont offset higher raw material costs, as did a reduction in its fixed costs of 7 cents per share versus a year ago. DuPont, which has suffered because of rising energy prices, told analysts that higher raw materials prices added $180 million to its costs during the quarter, but the company expected that increase to be smaller in the current period. It said Tuesday that it expects to complete its $1.7 billion share buyback by the end of 2007. Shares rose 1.2 percent, or 55 cents, to $46.00 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, after rising as much as 3.2 percent earlier in the session. Shares of DuPont, a component of the Dow Jones industrial average, have risen more than 16 percent in the last 3 months, outperforming the Standard and Poor's Chemicals index .GSPPM which is up about 11 percent during the same period.
