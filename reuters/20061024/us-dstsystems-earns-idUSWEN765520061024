 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - DST Systems Inc ( DST.N ), a provider of data and software services, on Monday reported lower third-quarter net income as lower expenses were more than offset by smaller license fee revenues and other items. 

 The company said earnings were $54.7 million, or 76 cents per share, compared with $154.3 million, or $1.97 per share, in the year-ago quarter. Accounting for items including lower depreciation expense and expenses related to an acquisition, the company reported income of $50.1 million, or 70 cents per share, compared with $53.8 million, or 69 cents per share. Analysts surveyed by Reuters Estimates had expected the company to report third-quarter earnings of 75 cents per share. It was not immediately clear whether these estimates were comparable to the company's income figures. Consolidated operating revenue rose 2 percent to $373.7 million. Analysts had expected the company to report revenue of $387.7 million. The company said a proposed accounting standard change could affect the way the company treats 17.1 million incremental shares to be issued from the assumed conversion of the $840 million of convertible debentures issued in August 2003 in calculating diluted earnings per share. Under the proposed method, net earnings per share would have been 70 cents per share in the third quarter, versus the reported earnings of 76 cents per share. DST said it is still evaluating the remaining aspects of this proposed accounting standard.
