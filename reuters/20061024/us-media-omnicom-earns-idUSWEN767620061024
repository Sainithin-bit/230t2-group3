 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Omnicom Group Inc. ( OMC.N ), the world's largest advertising services company, on Tuesday reported a better-than-expected rise in third-quarter earnings, helped by stronger revenue both in the United States and overseas. 

 Omnicom, home to advertising agencies such as BBDO Worldwide and DDB Worldwide, said profit rose 9.5 percent to $177.1 million, or $1.04 a share, from $161.7 million, or 90 cents share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected the company to earn $1 a share, on average, according to Reuters Estimates. Omnicom, which has a broad mix of marketing and advertising businesses and has steadily won new clients over the past year, also posted revenue that was slightly higher than the $2.73 billion analysts on average had forecast. For the quarter, the company said worldwide revenue rose 10 percent to $2.77 billion from $2.52 billion. Domestic revenue for the quarter rose 7.8 percent, while international revenue increased 12.7 percent. Omnicom shares closed at $94.88 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday. So far this year, they have risen 11.5 percent, while shares of its largest U.S. rival, Interpublic Group ( IPG.N ), have climbed about 10 percent. The rise in Omnicom's shares has partly been fueled by consistently strong organic revenue, an industry benchmark that excludes foreign currency impact and recent acquisitions. Organic revenue rose 8.2 percent in the third quarter, it said. Omnicom has also benefited from its broad mix of media services, as it has taken advantage of a steady shift by advertisers to unconventional marketing methods, from Internet campaigns to special events and promotions.
