 PARIS/NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A forecast-beating fourth quarter by U.S. telecommunications equipment maker Lucent offset slightly disappointing third-quarter sales from French merger partner Alcatel, boosting the shares of both companies. 

 Alcatel CGEP.PA posted a modest 1.4 percent rise in third-quarter sales to 3.33 billion euros ($4.18 billion) on Tuesday -- below the expected 3.46 billion euros in a Reuters poll, as weak wireless operations undermined solid fixed network sales. However, the Paris-based group's earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of 258 million euros ($323.7 million), down 7.2 percent year-on-year, was largely in line with forecasts. Shares of Alcatel, which is buying Lucent, rose more than 7 percent. Lucent Technologies Inc.'s LU.N net profit for the fourth quarter was $371 million, or 7 cents per diluted share, including a 1 cent tax windfall, against analysts' expectations of 4 cents per share. Lucent's shares rose 7.7 percent. Unlike Alcatel, Lucent did particularly well in wireless, thanks to software upgrades to high-speed mobile phone networks in North America, known as CDMA EV/DO Rev A. "The good news comes from Lucent, which is why (Alcatel) shares are up," said analyst Richard Windsor at Nomura. Alcatel's third-quarter net profit of 155 million euros, undershot expectations of 171.1 million. Neither Lucent nor Alcatel gave an earnings forecast, but Alcatel Chief Operating Office Mike Quigley did not expect competitive pressure for mobile networks to ease in the next few quarters, as most emerging markets had started the operation of their mobile networks, slowing the pace. "The mobile market has been slowing somewhat. We think it (market growth) is probably around again mid-single digits this year in 2006," Quigley said in a conference call. FIXED LINE STRONG Alcatel's all-share acquisition of Lucent is still awaiting approval by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which Alcatel expects in November. Lucent Chief Executive Patricia Russo said in an interview she did not expect U.S. approval of the roughly $14 billion deal to require any divestitures on Lucent's part. The combination would create one of the world's biggest suppliers of network hardware and software for mobile and high- speed Internet communications, with $25 billion in annual revenues, competing for the top spot with Cisco Systems Inc.  ( CSCO.O ). The bulk of Alcatel's profits came from its wired telecoms unit, which totaled 151 million euros during the period. Sales from Internet Protocol routing products doubled in the third quarter, as telecoms operators around the world upgrade networks for television and video-on-demand services. "We don't expect that to stop any time soon. It is being driven largely by video," Quigley said. Revenues in the mobile segment fell to 994 million euros in the third quarter from 1.092 billion a year ago. Alcatel expects to acquire a third generation mobile phone network unit from Nortel NT.TO in early December, Chairman and Chief Executive Serge Tchuruk said in a conference call. Telecoms operators have been waiting for the deals with Nortel and Lucent to go through before making purchasing decisions, temporarily weakening Alcatel's mobile order book. "How can they (telecoms operators) buy Alcatel products if the merger with Lucent and especially with Nortel is not done yet," Tchuruk said. "They cannot do otherwise but to wait." Lucent CEO Pat Russo, chief executive designate for the combined company, also saw customers holding off. "We are seeing some impact as customers are pausing and seeking clarity about our decisions with respect to our product portfolio," she said. Some analysts said the results showed the synergies between Lucent and Alcatel were working, as Lucent's earnings supported Alcatel in the third quarter and vice versa in the second quarter. But others remained skeptical. "Lucent's CDMA was strong, but it was weak in Q2. It says nothing about the health of the CDMA market, which is in terminal decline," said analyst Per Lindberg at Dredsner Kleinwort.
