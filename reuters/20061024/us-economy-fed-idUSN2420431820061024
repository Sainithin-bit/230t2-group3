 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. Federal Reserve policy-makers started a two-day meeting on Tuesday that was widely expected to conclude with a decision to hold interest rates steady along with a renewed warning on the risk of inflation. 

 The Federal Open Market Committee began meeting at about 2 p.m. (1600 GMT), a Fed official said. The U.S. central bank is expected to announce its decision around 2:15 p.m. (1815) on Wednesday. After a more than two-year long campaign of interest rate increases, the Fed moved to the sidelines in August and again held overnight rates steady at 5.25 percent in September. However, officials have kept the possibility of more rate hikes on the table as they continued to warn of the risk inflation could stay unacceptably high. A month ago, financial markets had been thinking a housing-led slowdown in U.S. economic growth could lead to a series of rate reductions beginning early next year. Recently, however, markets have begun to price in some chance that the Fed might raise credit costs again to deal with persistent price pressures. Interest rate futures markets on Tuesday showed investors fully convinced the Fed will leave rates steady this week. Still, they implied an 8 percent chance of a rate hike in December and an 18 percent chance of a rise in January. A month ago, they had priced in as many as three quarter-percentage point rate cuts during 2007. A Reuters poll of 21 big U.S. bond trading firms last week found seven predicting higher rates ahead, while 14 were looking for the Fed's next move to be a cut.
