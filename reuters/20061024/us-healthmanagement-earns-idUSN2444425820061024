 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Health Management Associates Inc. ( HMA.N ), one of the biggest U.S. hospital chains, said on Tuesday that quarterly earnings fell short of expectations, hurt by industry woes of unpaid medical bills and slowing patient admissions. 

 Shares fell about 2 percent in mid-morning trade. Analysts peppered HMA officials on its conference call about its ability to meet its 2006 forecast of $1.30 to $1.34 per share, given its third-quarter miss. HMA officials said uncertainty remains as to when slowing growth in patient admissions and rising rolls of uninsured will ease. "The hospital industry is facing challenging times," Chief Executive Joseph Vumbacco said, adding the company is aggressively signing patients up for government insurance programs and collecting bills from those with insurance. "This was not a very pleasing quarter for us." The 2006 guidance is in "jeopardy," given third-quarter results, said John Ransom, an analyst at Raymond James, echoing the sentiment of other analysts. "The company continues to struggle in what remains a challenging operating environment." Weak patient admissions volume and unpaid medical bills have been dragging on hospital profits in recent years amid rising numbers of those without health insurance in the United States, now at about 46 million people. Unpaid medical bills as a percentage of total revenue rose to 9.5 percent from 8.4 percent a year earlier. Adjusted admissions in the quarter declined 0.1 percent from a year ago. Third-quarter net profit fell to $74.4 million, or 31 cents per share, from $87.8 million or 35 cents per share, a year ago. Analysts said the company, which owns more than 50 acute-care hospitals in the U.S. Southeast and Southwest, earned 27 cents per share, excluding special items. The results missed the average analyst estimate of 30 cents per share, according to Reuters' Estimates. "A big part of the miss versus our model was driven by higher bad debt expense," said Jason Gurda, an analyst at Bear Stearns. "Overall trends remain concerning." Revenue rose to $994.1 million from $902.7 million a year earlier. The stock dropped 44 cents to $20.12 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Additional reporting by Edward Tobin)
