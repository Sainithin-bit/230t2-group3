 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Copper miner Phelps Dodge Corp. PD.N on Tuesday said third-quarter profit more than doubled, but results fell short of analysts' forecasts due to hedging that locked the company into lower prices as copper sky-rocketed. 

 The company, which has approximately $4.1 billion cash in hand, pledged to return more of it to shareholders by the end of the year. It also said new projects in the United States, Peru and Democratic Republic of Congo are expected to add 300,000 tons -- more than 10 percent -- of annual copper production to its account by late 2008. Phelps Dodge said it expects to receive another $350 million in the fourth quarter from Canadian nickel miner Inco Inc. N.TO after their proposed $17.3 billion merger fell through apart last month. Inco already paid Phelps Dodge $125 million in break-up fees. The company's stock, which had risen approximately 25 percent this month since the unsuccessful Inco deal, fell over 2 percent after the earnings announcement. But analysts noted the price of copper was also down on global markets. In mid-afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Phelps shares were off $2.07, or 2 percent at $96.95. "All in all, it was a very uneventful quarter," Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Steven Whisler told analysts with no apparent sense of irony. The Phoenix, Arizona-based miner said third-quarter net earnings were $888 million, or $4.36 per share, compared with $366.1 million, or $1.81 per share, a year earlier. The earnings included special gains of 17 cents per share and special charges of 54 cents per share. Excluding those one-time items, earnings were $4.73 per share. Analysts on average were expecting $4.84, according to Reuters Estimates. Looking ahead, Chief Financial Officer Ramiro Peru said he expects fourth-quarter earnings in the range of $4.75 to $5.50 per share, including a $1.30 gain from Inco's break-up fee. The forecast was based on an average copper price of $3.28 to $3.30 per pound. Excluding special items, the average forecast of analysts is currently $4.14 per share. Phelps Dodge said sales soared to $3.46 billion from $2.18 billion a year earlier as the price of copper touched $3.70 per pound, close to a record high around $3.80 hit in May. PROFIT HELD BACK However, profit for the last three quarters has been constrained because Phelps locked in portions of its 2006 and 2007 copper production at prices far below current market prices, which have soared six-fold in the last three years. "I think most (analysts) excluded the collars," analyst Charles Bradford, of Bradford Research/Soleil, referring to the locked-in price mechanisms that constrained earnings. "They are very difficult to calculate." In addition, Bradford said the gains related to the termination of its offers for Canadian mining companies, Falconbridge and Inco N.TO may not have figured in Wall Street's earnings estimate calculations. The company said its copper collar programs represent about 25 percent of expected annual copper sales for 2006 and about 20 percent for 2007. Asked during the conference call with analysts about plans to dispose of the huge amount of cash the company holds, Whisler said Phelps' priorities were to maintain its credit rating and to reward shareholders. He noted that of $2 billion earmarked for shareholders since last year, $1.3 billion has been returned through dividends and stock repurchases. The board is looking at ways to return the remaining $700 million by year's end. "The cash situation being as it is, we need to do something sooner rather than later," he said. Looking ahead, the company projected a strong outlook for both copper and molybdenum markets in 2006 and balanced markets for both metals in 2007. (Additional reporting by  Carole Vaporean )
