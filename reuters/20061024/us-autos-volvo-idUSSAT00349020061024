 STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - Truck maker Volvo posted a smaller-than-expected drop in quarterly pretax profit on Tuesday and said key markets would be at the top end of its forecasts this year, though North America would weaken in 2007. 

 The Sweden-based firm, the world's No. 2 truck maker, said third-quarter pretax earnings fell to 3.14 billion crowns ($428 million) from 4.02 billion a year ago, but topped the mean forecast of 2.96 billion in a Reuters poll of 17 analysts. Earnings were hit by a 1.7 billion crown writedown of goodwill, which was included in analysts' estimates. Revenues at the firm, which sells trucks, buses, construction equipment and a broad range of engines, rose to 57.43 billion crowns from 52.25 billion a year ago, above the mean forecast of 56.58 billion in the poll. Truck markets on both sides of the Atlantic are seen peaking this year, with demand supercharged by customers accelerating purchases of older, but cheaper, trucks ahead of stricter environmental rules implemented in Europe this month and set to come into effect in the United States at the turn of the year. Analysts predict a slide in truck sales next year as the spending spree tails off, especially in North America. Volvo confirmed this picture. "We are anticipating that the decline could be as much as 40 percent during the first half of the year," the firm said. Chief Executive Leif Johansson told a news conference this was a "worst-case scenario", though a planned cut in production capacity would hit both temporary and full-time employees. "I think some will feel that this 40-percent decline is a bit negative," an analyst said. "Market estimates have ranged from a drop of 20 to 40 percent for the full year." Johansson said he expected the North American market to come back during the second half of next year and that the firm was prepared to raise production capacity again if needed. TRUCK ORDERS HIT The firm said order intake for its trucks, sold under the Volvo, Renault and Mack brands, fell 22 percent year-on-year in the quarter, mainly due to a 58-percent plunge in North America. Volvo said the European heavy truck market, where pre-buying has been less pronounced, would be largely in line with 2006. "...we expect the European market to be stable or slightly stronger than last year's relevant market," Johansson said. The firm saw total industry sales at the top end of its forecasts this year, at around 290,000 units in Europe and around 340,000 units in North America. Shares in Volvo opened slightly higher and were up 0.1 percent at 451 crowns by 0930 GMT, outperforming the DJ Stoxx auto index which was down 0.5 percent. Volvo trades at 11.9 times estimated 2006 earnings compared with 16.3 for rival DaimlerChrysler, which also makes cars. "After Scania's numbers, which came in so strong, the market has had high expectations of Volvo", said analyst Adam Jonas at Morgan Stanley. "We don't see their (U.S.) outlook as something that will change estimates." Volvo management has come under pressure to return more of its hefty cash pile to shareholders after activist fund Cevian and Parvus Asset Management built up a 5.3 percent stake, to become the second-biggest owner of voting rights after Renault's 20 percent. The truck maker has responded by setting more demanding financial targets, but has said it would only decide on raised shareholder returns after possible acquisitions. As consolidation in the industry has accelerated, evident not least in German MAN's bid for smaller Swedish rival Scania, Volvo has started to expand in Asia. It last month agreed to boost its holding in Japan's Nissan Diesel Motor Co. to 46.5 percent. Indian media have reported it is eyeing a stake in Ashok Leyland Ltd..
