 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Communications equipment maker Lucent Technologies Inc. LU.N said on Tuesday its net profit for the fiscal fourth quarter was mostly flat from the year-ago quarter. 

 Net income for the quarter ended September 30 was $371 million, or 7 cents a diluted share, from $372 million, or 7 cents in the year-ago quarter, it said. Revenue was $2.56 billion, a rise of 5 percent from the year-ago quarter. Lucent is due to be acquired by France's Alcatel CGEP.PA, pending approval by the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.
