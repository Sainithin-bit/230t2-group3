 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Telecommunications carrier BellSouth Corp. BLS.N said on Tuesday third-quarter earnings rose, led by growth in wireless and high-speed Internet services. 

 BellSouth, which plans to be bought by AT&T Inc. ( T.N ), said earnings, including its 40 percent share in wireless company Cingular but excluding special items, totaled $1.18 billion, or 65 cents a share. That compares with $938 million, or 51 cents a share, in the same quarter a year earlier.
