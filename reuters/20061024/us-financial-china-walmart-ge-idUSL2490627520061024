 CHICAGO/HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) is teaming up with Chinese bank Shenzhen Development Bank ( 000001.SZ ) to launch a credit card in China, tapping the country's $2 trillion in domestic savings. 

 The co-branded card would be Wal-Mart's second in as many months, following a deal with Bank of Communications Co. ( 3328.HK ), which is 19.9-percent owned by HSBC Holdings Plc. ( 0005.HK ) ( HSBA.L ), Wal-Mart spokesman Jonathan Dong said. GE Money, the consumer finance arm of General Electric Co. ( GE.N ), will provide technical support for the card venture, which would be unveiled on Friday, a Shenzhen Development Bank spokeswoman said on Tuesday. The latest card would be offered in affluent southern China, while the Bank of Communications co-branded card is available in the northern part of the country. Both credit cards are dual-currency and can be used inside China or abroad. Wal-Mart vice chairman John Menzer mentioned the credit card deals in a presentation to analysts in New Jersey on Monday evening, listing them as among the growth opportunities for Wal-Mart's financial services business. Foreign banks are currently prohibited from independently issuing any type of bank card or setting up card joint ventures in China. HSBC and Citigroup Inc. ( C.N ), two early market entrants, are seeking to become the first companies to do so. Wal-Mart, which competes with Carrefour SA ( CARR.PA ) and other global retailers in China, operates 66 stores in 34 cities across the country. Wal-Mart is planning to buy Trust-Mart, a closely held Taiwan company with 100 supercenters in China, for US$1 billion, sources said last week, which would more than double its presence in the world's most populous country. U.S. private equity firm Newbridge Capital NB.UL bought a 17.89 percent stake in Shenzhen Development Bank for 1.24 billion yuan in 2004, making the U.S. firm the first foreign controlling shareholder of a local bank. Last October, GE Consumer Finance said that it would pay US$100 million for a 7.3 percent stake in Shenzhen Bank, a deal that hasn't yet been approved by Chinese regulators.
