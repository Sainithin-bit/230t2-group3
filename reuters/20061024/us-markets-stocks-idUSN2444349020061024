 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. tech stocks fell on Tuesday, led by a drop in Texas Instruments Inc. TXN.N, but the Dow industrials closed at another record high, boosted by General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) on expectations it will report strong results on Wednesday. 

 Texas Instruments' shares fell 4.3 percent to $30.52 after the company late on Monday forecast fourth-quarter revenue below average Wall Street estimates, raising concerns about the outlook for corporate profits in the telecommunication equipment sector. But some tech shares may rebound on Wednesday after Web retailer Amazon.com ( AMZN.O ) after the bell reported third-quarter net income that topped Wall Street estimates, sending its shares up 12 percent in composite after-hours trading.  Altria Group ( MO.N ) weighed on the Dow and Standard & Poor's 500 stock gauges, sliding 0.4 percent to $79.82, after Kraft Foods Inc. KFT.N, which is majority-owned by Altria, posted lower-than-expected sales growth. Kraft fell 2.6 percent to $35.36. Investors were also cautious as Federal Reserve policy makers began a two-day meeting that could yield indications about future interest rate moves. The announcement on the Fed's deliberations is expected on Wednesday afternoon. "Investors have been a little wary of adding to stocks in a group such as telecommunication, where the outlook is not so bright," said Steve Neimeth, portfolio manager for AIG SunAmerica Asset Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  finished up 10.97 points, or 0.09 percent, at 12,127.88, a record closing high. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  closed up 0.36 points, or 0.03 percent, at 1,377.38. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  ended down 10.72 points, or 0.46 percent, at 2,344.84. Earlier in the session the Dow hit an intraday record peak of 12,133.80. The drop in Texas Instruments, the No. 1 maker of chips for cell phones, sent shares of cell-phone equipment makers lower, weighing on the Nasdaq. Shares of Qualcomm Inc. ( QCOM.O ), the wireless chip developer, slid 3.6 percent to $36.71, and Broadcom Corp. ( BRCM.O ), a maker of wireless and networking chips, fell 2.1 percent to $27. Shares of Amgen Inc. ( AMGN.O ), the world's largest biotechnology company, rose 2.1 percent to $74.94 after its quarterly results late Monday topped expectations and it raised its full-year earnings forecast. General Motors, the biggest gainer on the Dow, rose 2.8 percent to $36.19. The world's largest automaker is expected to post a strong quarterly profit on Wednesday.  Among other gainers, AK Steel Holding Corp. ( AKS.N ) reported a third-quarter profit on Tuesday, helped by higher steel prices.  AK Steel rose 3.7 percent to $15.56. Other steel shares also rose, with Nucor Corp. ( NUE.N ) jumping nearly 12 percent to $61.58 and U.S. Steel Corp. ( X.N ) up 5.4 percent to $70.19. Overall, profits for Standard & Poor's 500 companies are expected to grow nearly 15 percent in the third quarter, with more than 70 percent of companies that have reported results so far beating estimates, according to Reuters Estimates. Volume was active on the NYSE, where about 1.68 billion shares changed hands, above last year's daily average of 1.61 billion. On the Nasdaq, about 1.85 billion shares were traded, above last year's daily average of 1.80 billion. Gainers outnumbered decliners on the Big Board by about 5-to-4. On the Nasdaq, about 7 stocks fell for every 5 that rose.
