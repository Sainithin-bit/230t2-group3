 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Amazon.com on Tuesday posted third-quarter profit and revenue ahead of Wall Street expectations as the Web retailer slowed the growth of its technology spending, and its shares rose 12 percent. 

 The company also reported a sharp rise in sales of electronics and a rapid adoption of its Amazon Prime shipping program. Amazon, which sells everything from books and computers to diamonds and lawnmowers, said net income in the quarter fell to $19 million, or 5 cents per share, from $30 million, or 7 cents per share, a year earlier. Sales rose 24 percent to $2.31 billion. But that beat the expectations of Wall Street analysts, who on average had targeted earnings of 3 cents per share on sales of $2.25 billion, based on Reuters Estimates. Third-quarter operating income of $40 million also topped Wall Street's $32.7 million target. Amazon, the second-most-popular e-commerce site behind eBay Inc., has been seen as focusing on revenue growth at the expense of profits amid intense competition. In the process, it has alienated many investors who wonder when its heavy investments will pay off. Technology and content spending rose 42 percent to $172 million, but that was a sharp deceleration from the 74 percent rise in the year-ago quarter. Stifel Nicolaus analyst Scott Devitt said Amazon's operating profit margin was ahead of Wall Street expectations. "It's low relative to recent history, but it was above expectations, that's why the stock is up so much after hours," he said. North American segment sales rose 21 percent to $1.26 billion, while international sales rose 29 percent to $1.05 billion. Worldwide electronics sales rose 43 percent to $699 million, accounting for 30 percent of worldwide net sales, up from 26 percent in the year-ago quarter. Chief Executive Jeff Bezos said he was pleased with the rapid adoption of Amazon Prime, a membership shipping program that is costly to the company but aims to bring in new customers. Yet Global Crown Capital analyst Martin Pyykkonen was skeptical about whether the company had changed dramatically in the quarter. "It's not as though in the third quarter they figured out a new formula for how to be more profitable because their outlook for the fourth quarter is in line (with analyst estimates)," he said. Amazon said it now expects fourth-quarter sales of $3.63 billion to $3.95 billion, while Wall Street on average had expected revenue of $3.69 billion. It also projected operating earnings of $145 million to $235 million for the fourth quarter, versus the Wall Street target of $178 million. The stock, which had been down 31 percent in 2006, is valued at 49 times estimated 2007 earnings, or three times that of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. at 16, and an average multiple of 15 in the Standard & Poor's Retailing Index. Expectations that Amazon will sharply boost its low margins mean it also trades at a premium to rival Internet stocks such as Google Inc., eBay and Yahoo Inc. Amazon shares rose to $37.68 in after-hours trade from a close of $33.63 on Nasdaq.
