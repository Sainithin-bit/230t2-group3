 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - BellSouth Corp. BLS.N posted a better-than-expected rise in quarterly earnings on Tuesday as growth in wireless and high-speed Internet services helped to offset a fall in traditional land line subscriptions. 

 The telecommunications carrier, which has agreed to be bought by AT&T Inc. ( T.N ), said profit, including its 40 percent stake in Cingular Wireless but excluding special items, rose 26 percent to $1.18 billion, or 65 cents a share. That beat the average forecast from analysts surveyed by Reuters Estimates. which showed earnings before special items of 58 cents a share. Analysts said that in addition to strong profits announced by Cingular last Friday and growth in Internet services, BellSouth's bottom line was bolstered by lower advertising and capital spending ahead of its merger with AT&T. "The beat appears to be founded on a decrease in marketing expenditures and better wireline cost controls prior to the AT&T merger," said Jeff Halpern, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, also noting a rise in average revenue per user. BellSouth shares were marginally lower in New York Stock Exchange trading, as investors had already expected strong earnings after Cingular's results last week. Net income from continuing operations rose 30 percent to $1.06 billion, or 58 cents a share. BellSouth said earnings from Cingular were a key contributor in the quarter. Operating expenses fell 8 percent from a year earlier to $3.77 billion. AT&T, which holds the remaining 60 percent stake in Cingular, also announced firm earnings on Monday, citing strong growth in the wireless venture despite a fall in traditional phone subscribers and competition from cable companies. BellSouth's access lines as of September 30 totaled 19 million, down 6.9 percent year-over-year. Retail residential lines fell 135,000, the company said, reflecting a shift to mobile phones and competition from cable providers' telephone services. Growth in Internet subscriptions, along with wireless communications, also helped to bolster business. Network data revenue in the quarter exceeded $1.3 billion, a 12.8 percent rise from a year earlier, it said. The company said growth in such new services, as well as cost-cutting and a rise in long-distance services, helped to boost its operating margin to 25.7 percent, a rise of 3.4 percentage points from a year earlier. "Now that we're at scale with DSL, long distance and increasingly emerging data services, all or a vast majority of the revenue from these services flows through to the margin," BellSouth Chief Financial Officer Pat Shannon said. Total consolidated revenue from continuing operations totaled $5.2 billion in the third quarter, up 3 percent from a year earlier. BellSouth shares were down 3 cents at $45.56 in late trade on the New York Stock Exchange. They have risen 70 percent this year. AT&T, which was down 3 cents at $34.68, has gained 40 percent so far this year. Under their merger agreement, announced in March, BellSouth shareholders are to receive 1.325 shares of AT&T common stock for each common share of BellSouth.
