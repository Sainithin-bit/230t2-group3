 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Whirlpool Corp. ( WHR.N ) on Tuesday reported slightly higher third-quarter profit on strong international sales, but world's No. 1 appliance maker warned of softening demand in the United States, sending its shares down 3.5 percent. 

 Whirlpool cut its estimate for growth in appliance shipments in North America, its largest market, where demand has been hurt by higher borrowing costs and declining home sales. Third-quarter net earnings rose to $117 million, or $1.47 a share, from $114 million, or $1.66 a share, a year earlier. The results included many special items such as a gain of $40 million from an asset sale and a pension curtailment charge of $15 million. Profit from continuing operations came to $134 million, or $1.68 a share, Whirlpool said. "Sales were better than expected and Whirlpool reiterated guidance for the full year," said Morgan Keegan analyst Laura Champine. Sales jumped 35 percent to $4.8 billion, boosted by the March acquisition of Maytag. Excluding Maytag, core Whirlpool sales were up 8 percent. In North America, sales rose 45 percent to $3.3 billion including Maytag. Discounting the acquisition, sales gained just 4 percent, down from a 5 percent rise in the second quarter. Whirlpool, based in Benton Harbor, Michigan, reported good demand for new products such as its top-loading Cabrio washing machine and said price increases and savings from the Maytag acquisition helped cover rising materials costs. But it said industrywide U.S. shipments of major appliances fell about 1 percent in the quarter. Whirlpool cut its 2006 growth forecast for industrywide shipments in North America, which accounts for 68 percent of total sales, to about 1 percent. In July it forecast growth of 1 percent to 2 percent. "The industry in the United States is softening, and that's driven by higher interest rates," Champine said. Whirlpool's third-quarter sales were up 9 percent in Europe, 32 percent in Latin America and 10 percent in Asia. The company raised its growth forecasts for industry unit shipments in Europe and Latin America, which together account for about 30 percent of total sales. Whirlpool said it sold the Amana commercial microwave and Dixie Narco vending equipment operations -- two businesses owned by its former rival -- for about $100 million during the third quarter. It said it still expects to sell the Hoover vacuum and Jade commercial appliance businesses, which it classified as discontinued operations. The Benton Harbor, Michigan, maker said it still expects full-year profit from continuing operations of $6 to $6.25 a share for 2006 and $9 a share for 2007. Analysts expect $6.13 for 2006 and $8.72 for 2007, according to Reuters Estimates. Whirlpool shares were down $3.16, or 3.5 percent, to $86.17 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock is up 3 percent on the year but has fallen 10 percent from an all-time high of $96 reached in late March.
