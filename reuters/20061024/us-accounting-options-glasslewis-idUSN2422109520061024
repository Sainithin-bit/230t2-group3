 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - At least 153 companies have announced internal reviews or U.S. government investigations of past stock option granting practices, said investment research firm Glass Lewis & Co. on Tuesday. 

 The firm said in a report that the spreading option backdating scandal has resulted in the firing or dismissal of at least 45 executives and directors at 25 companies. "We continue to see more companies that appear to have backdated, but have yet to disclose anything to investors, including any investigations by law enforcement agencies," said Lynn Turner, Glass Lewis managing director of research and former Securities and Exchange Commission chief accountant. Glass Lewis said the backdating scandal -- involving manipulation of the exercise prices of stock options to boost their value to corporate executives who received them -- remains heavily concentrated in the high technology sector. Of 153 companies affected, 68 are semiconductor, software and programming, or communications equipment groups, while 15 retailers are also involved, the firm said. U.S. prosecutors have filed criminal fraud charges over the issue against former executives of Brocade Communications Systems Inc. ( BRCD.O ) and Comverse Technology Inc. CMVT.O. Earlier this month, health insurance giant UnitedHealth Group Inc. ( UNH.N ) said longtime chief executive William McGuire would quit amid an options practices inquiry.
