 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - French-German defense contractor EADS ( EAD.PA ) has been cleared to resume work on a U.S. Army light helicopter contract now that the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) rejected protests from other bidders, an EADS spokesman told Reuters on Tuesday. 

 In June, the Army chose EADS to build a new fleet of up to 352 light utility helicopters in a deal valued at up to $3 billion. Losing bidders, AgustaWestland, a unit of Italy's Finmeccanica SpA ( SIFI.MI ), which had joined forces with L-3 Communications Holdings ( LLL.N ), and MD Helicopters Inc., a small private company, protested the decision to the GAO. Textron Inc.'s ( TXT.N ) Bell Helicopter unit had also bid for the contract. EADS teamed with Sikorsky Aircraft, a unit of United Technologies Corp. ( UTX.N ), to win the competition, which includes an initial order of 322 helicopters and an option for 30 additional aircraft. Army spokeswoman Kim Henry said the Light Utility Helicopter project office would now execute the contract previously signed with EADS. EADS had no further comment. The Army contract was the first major U.S. defense contract won by the North American unit of EADS. Analysts say the Army deal could also help EADS win more commercial and government orders for its twin-engine UH-145 rotary wing aircraft. The new helicopters, based on Eurocopter's EC145, will replace hundreds of the Army's Vietnam-era UH-1s and Kiowas, and will also be used for homeland defense, humanitarian and other noncombat missions.
