 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings Inc. CME.N, parent of the largest U.S. futures exchange, on Tuesday said quarterly profit jumped 34 percent on a rising tide of higher-margin trading. 

 The results came a week after CME announced a proposed merger with long-time rival the Chicago Board of Trade BOT.N that is expected to create the world's largest derivatives mart. CME's third-quarter net income rose to $103.8 million, or $2.95 per share, from $77.5 million, or $2.22 a share, a year earlier. Analysts, on average, expected earnings of $2.86 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Net revenue, while up 22 percent to $274.7 million against $225.7 million, missed Wall Street's forecast of $282.2 million. Average daily trading volume for the quarter was previously reported at almost 5.4 million contracts, up 28 percent on the year, when the lower-priced TRAKRS products were excluded. CME said its rate per contract (RPC) for the quarter, a key measure of margins, was 64.1 cents, up from 63.2 cents in the second quarter, excluding TRAKRS. The increase reflected steadily rising use of Globex, CME's electronic platform, for interest rate options trading. Electronic options volume for the quarter was 148,000 contracts a day, nearly triple a year ago, accounting for 12 percent of total CME options volume. That helped the RPC for the interest rate segment, CME's busiest, rise almost 4 percent on the quarter. Total expenses rose 11 percent for the quarter to $117.7 million, driven by licensing, technology maintenance and compensation-related costs. Operating margins were 59 percent against 55 percent for the same quarter a year ago. CME's working capital rose by about $76 million during the quarter to more than $1.2 billion as of September 30.
