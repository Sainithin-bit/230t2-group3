 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp. ( LMT.N ) said on Tuesday that third-quarter profit rose a greater-than-expected 47 percent, as the world's No. 1 defense contractor posted strong sales of electronic systems and benefited from a one-time tax gain. 

 Lockheed, which is taking advantage of record levels in U.S. defense spending, extra funding for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and more outsourcing of government technology projects, also raised its full-year profit forecast above Wall Street estimates. The company, best known for its F-16 fighter jets and Patriot missiles but focused increasingly on civilian technology, said profit increased to $629 million, or $1.46 per share, from $427 million, or 96 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue rose 4 percent to $9.61 billion. Profit easily beat Wall Street's expectation of $1.24 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue was below analysts' average estimate of $9.8 billion. The Bethesda, Maryland-based company posted higher sales at its systems and information technology unit and at its space systems unit. Sales at its aeronautics unit fell. It benefited in the quarter from a one-time land sale, which increased profit by 5 cents per share, and a one-time tax gain related to export tax benefits claimed for previous years, which increased profit by 14 cents per share. Citing operational improvements and the benefit of one-time gains, Lockheed raised its full-year profit forecast to a range of $5.45 to $5.60 per share. Analysts expected $5.29 per share, on average. For 2007, Lockheed forecast profit in the range of $5.60 to $5.80 per share. Analysts expected $5.65 per share, on average. Lockheed shares are up about 41 percent over the past 12 months, leading the Standard & Poor's Aerospace and Defense index .GSPAERO to a gain of about 27 percent. Defense companies have mostly outperformed other large companies, with the S&P 500 index  .SPX  up about 16 percent over the past 12 months.
