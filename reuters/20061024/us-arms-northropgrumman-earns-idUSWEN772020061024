 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Northrop Grumman Corp. ( NOC.N ) said on Tuesday that third-quarter profit rose 3 percent, as the No. 3 U.S. defense contractor posted higher sales at most of its units but took a large legal charge. 

 Northrop, which makes warships, nuclear submarines, unmanned surveillance planes and a range of military electronics, lowered its full-year profit forecast to account for the charge. The Los Angeles-based company reported net profit increased to $302 million, or 86 cents per share, from $293 million, or 81 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue was up 2 percent to $7.4 billion. Earnings from continuing operations were 87 cents per share, below Wall Street's average expectation of $1.07 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Analysts expected revenue of $7.8 billion. Northrop took a charge of $112.5 million before taxes to cover potential claims by the U.S. Justice Department and an unnamed customer over microelectronics parts produced by a unit of TRW Inc., a company that Northrop acquired. Northrop has made a settlement offer to the customer, but no agreement has yet been reached. Northrop, behind Lockheed Martin Corp. ( LMT.N ) and Boeing Co. ( BA.N ) among defense contractors, cut its full-year earnings forecast to account for the legal charge. It now sees profit of $4.20 to $4.25 per share for the full year, down from its previous forecast of $4.35 to $4.45. Analysts expected $4.47 per share, on average. Northrop shares are up about 28 percent over the past 12 months, helping the Standard & Poor's Aerospace and Defense index .GSPAERO to a gain of about 27 percent. Defense companies have mostly outperformed other large companies, with the S&P 500 Index  .SPX  up about 16 percent over the past 12 months.
