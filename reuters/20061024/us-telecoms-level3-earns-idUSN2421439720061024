 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Telecommunications service provider Level 3 Communications Inc. LVLT.O on Tuesday posted a narrower third-quarter loss with higher revenue and a gain from the sale of Software Spectrum. 

 The company posted a loss of $138 million, or 12 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $204 million, or 29 cents a share. Quarterly results for 2006 included a gain of 33 million or 3 cents per share from the sale of Software Spectrum. Revenue rose to $875 million from $384 million a year ago, helped by a series of acquisitions in the last year, including telecoms carriers WilTel and Progress Telecom. Analysts had expected a loss of 14 cents per share, before special items, on revenue of $883.35 million, according to Reuters Estimates. Level 3 said it expects fourth-quarter communications revenue of $785 million to $830 million and projected a quarterly loss of $185 million to $155 million.
