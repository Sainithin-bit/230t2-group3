 SEATTLE  (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT.O ) said on Tuesday it will defer around $1.5 billion in revenue from its current fiscal second-quarter to its third quarter to account for its upgrade plan and pre-shipments of its upcoming Windows Vista operating system and Office 2007 software suite. 

 Earlier on Tuesday, the world's largest software maker said it will begin a coupon program for personal computer buyers to upgrade to Vista when it premiers next year in an effort to avoid a drop-off in PC sales over the holidays and ahead of the software's release. The revenues from those products will be deferred until it is officially recognized as revenue in the third-quarter upon fulfillment of the program. Microsoft said it does not expect the deferral to affect its full-year sales outlook.
