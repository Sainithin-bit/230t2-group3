 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) shareholders may be rewarded if they wait out a few more months of disappointing sales, Wall Street analysts said on Tuesday, halfway through the retailer's two-day investor meeting. 

 Several brokerages raised their price targets on Wal-Mart's stock after the world's biggest retailer said on Monday that it would slow U.S. expansion and slash spending next year, freeing up cash that analysts said may be used for fatter dividends or stock buybacks. The bad news was that October sales at stores open at least a year -- a key retail measure known in industry parlance as "comps" -- were tracking below the company's expectations. The retailer cited weak demand for trendy skinny-leg pants and its recently launched Metro 7 fashion line, as well as remodeling efforts that have disrupted stores. Wal-Mart's stock tacked on another 1.1 percent to $51.84 in early New York Stock Exchange trading, adding to Monday's gain of nearly 4 percent. Banc of America Securities raised its price target to $56 from $53, citing improved cash flow and return on investment, as Wal-Mart cracks down on spending. "The completion of the remodel program coupled with less strain from energy prices should both bode well for the remainder of the year," the firm wrote in a note to clients. HSBC raised its price target to $55 per share from $52, pointing out that comparable-store sales growth should improve as Wal-Mart reduces the number of stores it builds close to existing ones. "The company needs all the comp-store sales it can get, with disappointing 1 percent October comps to date on the back of weak sales in 'skinny' and 'Metro' lines -- two adjectives not normally used in describing Wal-Mart's customer base," analyst Mark Husson wrote. "Valuations don't seem demanding and ought to render Wal-Mart accessible for value managers," he added. Bear Stearns analyst Christine Augustine kept her "outperform" rating on the stock even as she lowered earnings forecasts for the rest of the year. "Aside from sluggish comp-store sales performance, we believe Wal-Mart has made substantial progress over the past year toward meeting its financial objectives including the stabilization of return on invested capital," she wrote. "October comps are below plan, and apparel won't be fixed this year," she added, explaining the earnings forecast cuts.
