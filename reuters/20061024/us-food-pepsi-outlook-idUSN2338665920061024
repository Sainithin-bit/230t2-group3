 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - PepsiCo Inc. ( PEP.N ) on Monday said it will launch new healthier products next year and focus on growth in emerging markets, in a continuation of the strategy that helped the world's No. 2 beverage company stay profitable even as sales growth of its flagship soft drinks has slowed. 

 PepsiCo's new Chief Executive Indra Nooyi, who took the reins on October 1, also said the company was on track to meet its annual target of volume and revenue growth in the mid-single digits and earnings per share growth in the low double digits. Speaking at an analysts' conference in New York, Nooyi said she will continue to manage the company without a major departure from the strategy of her predecessor Steve Reinemund, who will retire in May. "Those who know me ... won't be surprised that (a radical shift in strategy) is not going to happen," Nooyi said, adding that she has been involved in the company's strategic planning for the last several years. Under Reinemund's watch, PepsiCo evolved from being known mostly for selling soda and salty snacks into a $33 billion food company that has embraced the push into healthier options like Tropicana juices, Aquafina water and whole grain Quaker Oats Cereals, while seeing earnings soar. From 2001 to 2005, the company's earnings per share jumped 80 percent, its dividend doubled and its market capitalization increased to more than $100 billion. The company on Monday said that, moving forward, its capital expenditures as a percentage of sales would increase, and that most of the increased spending will go to expansion in developing and emerging markets and adding manufacturing capacity for Gatorade and other noncarbonated drinks. PepsiCo also affirmed its targets for midteen-range profit growth in the international unit and 7-percent growth in the North American unit. Looking ahead, Nooyi said areas ripe for growth in North America are health and wellness, natural and organic products, and premium products. Mike White, the chief executive of PepsiCo International, said concerns about health and wellness were global. Because of growing concerns about obesity, PepsiCo executives said they were not pushing international consumers to increase the serving size of their salty snacks, but to just eat them more frequently. ACQUISITIONS PepsiCo will earmark $500 million a year for tuck-in acquisitions as part of an aggressive expansion strategy, Chief Financial Officer Richard Goodman said. "You will see more focus on acquisitions," said J.P. Morgan analyst John Faucher, adding that the company's recent success might give it flexibility to try new categories. "Our international portfolio is an unfinished mosaic," said PepsiCo International's White in an interview. "There are snack companies out there in western Europe that we would like to have." He also said the company wanted to broaden its offerings in China, where it currently sells potato chips flavored with lemon cucumber and cherry tomato. But Nooyi said the company's approach remains disciplined. "We will not make an acquisition unless we feel convinced it's the right thing to do and serves a need in our portfolio," she said in an interview. NEW PRODUCTS In order to develop new products for all markets, Nooyi said Pepsi would "tangibly and dramatically" accelerate its spending on research and development across the company. Among the innovations unveiled on Monday was a new brand of snack chips, Flat Earth, made from fruits and vegetables. On the beverage side, PepsiCo unveiled a new sparkling drink called Tava, enhanced with vitamins and chromium, which it claims has been linked to weight loss. Earlier this month, rival Coca-Cola Co. ( KO.N ) introduced a sparkling green tea product which it said has ingredients that can speed metabolism and boost calorie-burning. PepsiCo also said it was adding a Gatorade line aimed at morning exercisers, a third flavor of its Diet Pepsi Jazz line, and rolling out vending machines that will sell hot cups of Starbucks Corp. ( SBUX.O ) coffee in places like college campuses and offices. Pepsi already has a deal with the world's largest coffee shop chain under which it sells Starbucks' bottled Frappuccinos, cans of Doubleshot espresso and iced coffee.
