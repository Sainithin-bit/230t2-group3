 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The former chief financial officer of Comverse Technology Inc. CMVT.O on Tuesday became the first executive to plead guilty in a wide investigation of stock options practices in corporate America. 

 David Kreinberg, who left the top finance job at Comverse in May, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy and one count of securities fraud. "I knew at the time that my actions and agreements with others at the company to act as I have were wrong," he told Judge Nicholas G. Garaufis in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn. He told the judge that he assisted the company's former chief executive, Jacob "Kobi" Alexander, with backdating options and concealing the practice from the company's board of directors and accountants. Prosecutors charged that Kreinberg, Alexander and Comverse former general counsel William Sorin engaged in an options scheme that allowed them to reap millions of dollars in profits by altering the grant dates of stock option awards. Overall, more than two dozen U.S. executives have resigned in the storm over stock options and at least 125 companies have mounted internal investigations or are being probed by the Securities and Exchange Commission to see if they wrongfully manipulated the dates of stock options they granted. The Justice Department and Internal Revenue Service are also looking into possible wrongdoing. Kreinberg has signed a cooperation agreement with federal prosecutors. The charges he faces carry a penalty of 15 years in prison and the government is estimating restitution of $51 million. His sentencing was set for February 23. Separately, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Brooklyn said that the SEC had settled its civil case against Kreinberg. Under the agreement, prosecutors said, Kreinberg must pay $2.4 million to settle the SEC charges and will be permanently banned from serving as an officer or director of a public company.
