 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Diversified U.S. manufacturer Honeywell 
International Inc ( HON.N ) said on Friday profit rose 22.2 
percent on strong demand from the aviation and commercial 
construction sectors. 

  The world's largest maker of cockpit electronics reported 
first-quarter profit of $643 million, or 85 cents per diluted 
share, compared with $526 million, or 66 cents per share, a 
year earlier.  Revenue at the company, which also makes thermostats and 
other control systems for large commercial buildings, was up 
10.6 percent.  Honeywell's results have been boosted of late by robust 
demand for aircraft as well as continued strong investment in 
airports, refineries and other infrastructure projects, 
particularly in the developing world.  So far this year, Honeywell shares have declined about 
almost 7 percent while the Standard & Poor's capital goods 
industry index .GSPIC is down about 8 percent.  (Reporting by  Scott Malone , editing by Mark Porter)
