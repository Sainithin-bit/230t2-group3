 LONDON  (Reuters) - U.S. buyout group J.C. Flowers has formally withdrawn from its 3.5 billion pound ($7 billion) pursuit of Friends Provident FP.L, it said on Friday, after the UK life insurer's board failed to engage in discussions. 

 "J.C. Flowers accordingly confirms that it has no present intention of making an offer for Friends Provident," it said in a statement. Flowers, whose initial proposal was rejected by Friends last month, has been frustrated at a lack of contact with the insurer's management and had indicated that, without talks, it was prepared to withdraw. In a clear sign of growing tension between the two sides, Flowers said earlier this week it would not increase its proposed offer above 150p a share and would formally withdraw if the Friends board did not start discussions before Friday evening.
