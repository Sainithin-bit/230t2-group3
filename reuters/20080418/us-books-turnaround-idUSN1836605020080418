 DETROIT  (Reuters) - "The Turnaround Kid" was advertised by publisher HarperCollins as an inside account of the corporate turnarounds that author Steve Miller has been involved in as one of corporate America's "fix-it" men. 

 But in the end it became part elegy to his wife, Maggie, who died from brain cancer in 2006. Miller said that the book, written in the aftermath of her death, would have had a different focus if it had been written today, at greater distance from that emotional event. As it is, his freewheeling tale of corporate crises is laced with accounts of his discussions with his wife on how to handle them. A one-time Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) executive, Miller dived headlong into the turnaround of Chrysler under Lee Iacocca in 1979. In 2003, he worked out a restructuring and sale of Bethlehem Steel to a company led by Wilbur Ross. He describes himself at that time as an "itinerant fix-it man." He has helped a dozen companies in various stages of distress since Chrysler, but the company with which he will be most closely identified is auto parts maker Delphi Corp, which he parachuted into in 2005. In a chapter titled "Motown Maelstrom", he writes that he saw an opportunity at Delphi to start to "deal with some of the irrational labor practices that were slowly killing the Big Three" U.S. automakers. But he now concedes he may have gone too far when he chose to highlight that Delphi's labor contract required top rates of $65 an hour even for someone mowing the lawns at a plant. That statement, made to reporters to explain why Delphi had filed for bankruptcy, drew an acrimonious response from United Auto Workers President Ron Gettelfinger, who organized opposition to Miller's demands for cuts. Rank-and-file workers understood Delphi's troubles, he writes, but "at the very top of the UAW, we encountered a much different attitude. Instead of calm leadership, we got frequent vitriolic verbal attacks on management." Miller took Delphi into bankruptcy in October 2005, aiming to cut the wage and benefit costs the company inherited as a spinoff from General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) six years earlier. His critics said he relished the idea of bankruptcy, a step he had taken with several other companies that he worked for in the past 20 years, but Miller says nothing could have been further from the truth. "The bankruptcy process in this country needs to be keelhauled, it takes way to long," Miller told reporters at an event in Detroit on April 15, noting that legal and other costs in the Delphi case are running at about $150 million a year. Delphi has cut several business units, reshaped its wages and benefits through buyouts to thousands of union workers in the United States and created a plan that retains pension plans for retirees. However, investors backed out of a $2.55 billion plan to support the reorganization on April 4, the day it was to start coming out of bankruptcy. Miller remains Delphi's executive chairman and the company remains in bankruptcy. Because the book was intended to be published just after Thanksgiving in 2007, when Delphi should have been out of bankruptcy, much of the Delphi end game is somewhat vague. "My career at Delphi got extended, over my objections," he said. "I'm starting to get this chapter on the case finished and I'm going to stay here until it's finished."
