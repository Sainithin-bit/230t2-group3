 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - Schlumberger Ltd ( SLB.N ), the world's largest oilfield services company, on Friday posted a first-quarter profit that fell short of expectations due partly to weather disruptions and lower income in its seismic business, sending shares down about 2 percent in pre-market trading. 

 After several years of robust growth, Schlumberger and peers like Halliburton Co ( HAL.N ) have seen growth slow in North America as overcapacity in markets like pressure pumping have weighed on prices. To help offset that slowdown, the companies are growing their international businesses. But even there, they must contend with factors including skyrocketing labor costs. "The most disappointing thing about the quarter is the margins," said Mark Urness, an analyst with Calyon Securities. "They just don't have the pricing power they had in the last few years." Still, Urness said the company's long-term growth prospects were sound. Net income increased to $1.34 billion, or $1.09 per share, from $1.18 billion, or 96 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding discontinued operations, its profit was $1.06, below the Reuters Estimates consensus figure of $1.12 per share. Revenue was $6.29 billion, up from $5.46 billion a year earlier. "Seasonal factors and weather-related events, as well as lower product and software sales following the exceptional levels in the fourth quarter, had a general dampening effect on sequential revenue gains with a consequent effect on margins," Chairman and CEO Andrew Gould said in a statement. North American revenue rose 3 percent to $1.42 billion while pretax operating income fell 16 percent to $363 million. In Europe, Russia and Africa the company said revenue rose 24 percent to $1.9 billion, while pretax operating income climbed 16 percent to $500 million. First-quarter revenue in the company's WesternGeco seismic unit was $676 million, down 4 percent from a year earlier. Pretax operating income fell 26 percent to $196 million. But the company repeated its view that current levels of spending on exploration and production are insufficient to stem the decline of worldwide energy reserves. Schlumberger also said its board of directors on Thursday approved a new $8 billion stock buyback plan. In pre-market trading, shares of Schlumberger were at $93, down from Thursday's close of $95.30. (Reporting by Anna Driver in Houston, editing by Mark Porter)
