 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Women's clothing retailer Talbots Inc TLB.N stood by its 2008 outlook on Friday and said meeting that goal would give it sufficient funding to continue turning around its business. 

 The forecast was released after its shares fell almost 40 percent in the two days after the company disclosed that Bank of America ( BAC.N ) and Hongkong Shanghai Banking Corp ( HSBA.L ) would stop providing it letters of credit, which were used to back financing for merchandise bought overseas. Talbots' shares, which inched higher on Friday, had fallen even though Talbots said it had arranged "open account" payment terms with vendors that account for 75 percent of the company's overseas merchandise purchases. Those agreements actually improve the company's cash flow because they allow for payment in 45 days, instead of the the 22 days required under letters of credit, the company said. On Friday, Talbots said there was no additional cost increase on merchandise it purchases under the new agreements, addressing a concern raised by some analysts. Talbots, which is majority owned by Japan's Aeon Co Ltd ( 8267.T ), sells classic clothing to women over 35 at its namesake stores, and also operates the J. Jill chain. It is exiting its men and kids lines in a bid to focus on improving its core women's business, which has been struggling for over a year. The company also said again on Friday that it revised its payment terms with major vendors, giving it enhanced financial flexibility and increased operating cash flow. Talbots said it has working capital lines of credit totaling $165 million and believes that these lines will be enough to fund its working capital requirements for the current year. "Obviously this makes things a little bit better," said Stifel Nicolaus analyst Richard Jaffe. "The operative word here has been surprise." Talbots, which has had a long relationship with the commercial banks, should have better foreseen problems, Jaffe said. Moreover, he questioned why the banks with inside knowledge of the company would have chosen not to renew their relationship. "If they're saying 'No, thank you' to this strategic and lucrative relationship, it makes us all nervous," Jaffe said. The company said it expects to report a loss of 7 cents to 17 cents per share this year, hurt by a loss from discontinued operations of 59 to 64 cents per share. But on a continuing basis, the company stood by its full-year earnings forecast for a profit of 47 cents to 52 cents per share. Analysts on average are expecting a profit of 38 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Talbots said it expects slightly lower same-store sales in 2008. During a conference call with analysts on Friday, Talbots executives said they had been looking at its letters of credit for more than a year to determine if it should change to a different form of financing. Talbots Chief Executive Trudy Sullivan also conceded that the company did not effectively communicate the issues surrounding the change in financing. "We clearly misjudged the impact that the information disclosed in our 8-K filing would have on the investment community and the media," Sullivan said. Talbots' shares were up 1.7 percent to $7.96 in early Friday afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
