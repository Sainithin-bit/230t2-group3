 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Negotiators for the United Auto Workers union and General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) have extended talks indefinitely beyond a Friday strike deadline at a plant near Detroit that builds transmissions for the automaker's strong-selling cars and crossovers. 

 A strike at the plant would have been a second staggering blow to GM in as many days after workers at a GM assembly plant near Lansing, Michigan, walked out on Thursday. That plant produces popular crossover vehicles -- middle-sized SUVs built on car platforms for easier handling and better gas mileage. GM also said on Friday that it had received a 5-day strike notice on Thursday from a UAW local at a plant in Fairfax, Kansas, that produces the Chevrolet Malibu, a four-door sedan crucial to its product lineup. According to GM's website, as of April 2007 the Fairfax plant employed more than 1,800 hourly workers. GM spokesman Dan Flores said talks were continuing with UAW Local 31, which represents workers at the facility. "We're going to stay focused on the negotiations ... and on reaching a new agreement," Flores said. Local 31 representatives could not be reached for comment. The union and GM settled a master contract last year after a short nationwide strike, but have not completed agreements at the local level that cover work rules for the plants. On Friday, UAW Local 909, which represents about 1,000 hourly workers at a transmission plant in Warren, Michigan, near Detroit, said progress had been made and an indefinite extension arranged dependent on the movement of talks, according to a notice circulated to members. The local had set a 10 a.m. ET strike deadline for Friday and GM could be put on 12 hours' notice if the union did not see progress continuing, the notice said. The bargainers for GM and the Warren local negotiated through the night on Thursday and took a break Friday, with talks set to resume on Saturday morning, GM's Flores said. GM already has at least partly idled about 30 plants due to a UAW strike at major supplier, American Axle & Manufacturing Holdings Inc ( AXL.N ). However, that strike mainly affects GM's production of large pickups and SUVs that have been selling slowly due to the weak U.S. economy and high fuel prices. The Warren transmission plant builds four- and six-speed transmissions for GM cars, such as the Malibu, which the automaker has positioned to compete with Toyota Motor Corp's ( 7203.T ) Camry and Honda Motor Co Ltd's ( 7267.T ) Accord. The transmission plant also contributes to GM's Buick Enclave, Saturn Outlook and GMC Acadia crossovers that are assembled at its Lansing Delta Township plant where about 2,300 UAW Local 602 members went on strike Thursday. Talks broke off Thursday at the Delta Township plant between GM and the local UAW leadership, but resumed Friday. GM's production at the Delta Township plant is shut down. "It's obviously encouraging that talks resumed," GM's Flores said. "From our perspective, we want to continue bargaining until we reach a tentative agreement." Separately, the UAW and American Axle negotiators continued talks Friday toward reaching an agreement to end the strike by about 3,650 workers at five U.S. plants that started February 26. The UAW postponed a rally in support of striking workers that was scheduled for Friday and both sides have reported some progress in the talks. "Things are moving forward," American Axle spokeswoman Renee Rogers said on Friday. "There is progress being made, but any discussion of a tentative agreement is premature at this time." GM shares closed up 34 cents or 1.7 percent, at $20.13 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by Nick Carey and David Bailey, editing by Gerald E. McCormick,  Tim Dobbyn ,  Gary Hill )
