 BEIJING  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp will need to offer small vehicles at very low prices to reach first-time car buyers in China and hit the fastest-growing segment of the industry's biggest boom market, a senior executive said on Friday. 

 "Companies like GM can't sit back and say we don't want to compete in these lower cost markets," said Nick Reilly, president of GM's Asia Pacific operations. "We are working quite hard to be able to compete in these lower cost markets." Reilly, speaking at an industry conference ahead of the Beijing Auto Show, said GM had to consider offering vehicles as low as about $4,000 in order to capture the wave of first-time car buyers. "There's a huge number of people entering the market for the first time," Reilly said. GM, which ranked No. 2 by production in China last year, pursued an initial strategy of targeting more upscale Chinese buyers with its Buick brand. The Detroit-based automaker, which is counting on growth in emerging markets such as China to soften the blow of the ongoing downturn in U.S. sales, has also rolled out Chevrolet and Cadillac-branded vehicles over the past two years in China in order to offer a wider price range. Reilly said the accepted wisdom has been that the high end of the market -- closer to $40,000 per vehicle -- was the most profitable segment. But the growth projected at the low end of the market in China was forcing a re-examination. GM's sales in China rose almost 19 percent last year to top 1 million vehicles. GM has a joint venture with SAIC Motor Corp for passenger cars, including popular models such as the Buick Regal, priced near $20,000. Vehicle sales in China have grown by 20-30 percent for the past five years, a boom that has made it the world's second biggest market behind the United States. Reilly said GM would not compete with the ultra-low cost Nano car being developed by India's Tata Motors Ltd That car, unveiled earlier this year, is expected to set a new floor for pricing in emerging markets around $2,500. But he said GM was interested in building a car for China that could sell for somewhere around $4,000, a segment other established automakers such as rival Toyota Motor Corp are also exploring. In the Chinese market, a vehicle in the $4,000 price range would compete against the likes of the Chery QQ minicar or the Geely Meiri, which sell for the equivalent of about $4,600.
