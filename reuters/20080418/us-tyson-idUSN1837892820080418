 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - U.S. meat company Tyson Foods Inc ( TSN.N ) said on Friday that it would eliminate 110 jobs as it closes production at its York, Nebraska, plant. 

 The company said the workforce at its Emporia, Kansas, plant should be able to handle the production load at York with little additional staffing, the company said. (Reporting by  Alexandria Sage )
