 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp ( LMT.N ) has spent a significant amount to make its bid for a $15 billion contract for a fleet of combat search and rescue helicopters more attractive by making it less risky, a top official told Reuters this week. 

 Industry bids are due on May 22 for the Air Force project, which was initially awarded in 2006 to Boeing Co ( BA.N ) for a variant of its twin-rotor Chinook helicopter. But the Air Force was forced to redo the competition after the Government Accountability Office upheld protests filed by losing bidders Lockheed and United Technologies Corp ( UTX.N ). Lockheed plans to offer a variant of the EH101 Merlin helicopter built by AgustaWestland, a unit of Italy's Finmeccanica ( SIFI.MI ). It is the same aircraft that won the U.S. Navy's VH-71 presidential helicopter competition in 2005. Schedule delays and cost overruns on that program resulted in Lockheed getting a low rating for past performance during the initial competition for the Combat Search and Rescue helicopter. Lockheed and the U.S. Navy say the program has been restructured and is doing better. "We're giving the Air Force the absolute lowest risk proposal," Lockheed vice president Dan Spoor told Reuters in an interview. He said Lockheed was confident that its moves would make the bid more attractive to the Air Force. The company has focused on improving the past performance marks and eliminating a "high risk" rating it got the first time for new rotor blades that had not been tested. Spoor declined to estimate how much Lockheed had spent on the effort, saying only that the amount was significant. RISK REDUCTION He said the protest process had already delayed the operational fielding of the new helicopters by two years to 2014, so the Air Force would be looking for assurance that it would not face further delays once a contract was awarded. "We're very confident that we took all the right risk reduction actions," Spoor said. He said Britain was already flying the helicopter in Iraq and Afghanistan, and it had some key strengths over its competitors, including low noise, less downwash, three engines, and a small "footprint" despite its relatively large cabin. Analysts had widely expected Lockheed to win the competition the first time and even top Air Force officials were surprised that the larger Boeing helicopter won. Lockheed officials are optimistic that improvements made over the past two years will help change the Air Force ratings enough to swing the contract their way. Spoor said Lockheed was building a systems integration lab in Owego, New York, and had already used it to test the cockpit of the helicopter, now dubbed the HH-71. Its engineers are also writing software code to get a fast start if Lockheed wins the contract, Spoor said. Altogether, Lockheed has 80 to 100 people working on the program, he said. AgustaWestland has conducted flight tests of the new BERP IV rotor blades, and has already delivered two sets of them to Britain. That should help allay Air Force concerns about Lockheed's plan to use the blades on its helicopter, he said. Using the new blades, which provide greater lift, also made it possible for Lockheed to eliminate a 3,000 shaft horsepower engine being developed by General Electric ( GE.N ) and opt for a 2,500-horsepower version that is already being flown on the test aircraft for the presidential helicopter, he said. That engine, he said, already has over 1,800 flight hours, making it a less risky choice for the Air Force. The Lockheed team also conducted a successful aerial refueling of the proposed U.S. helicopter in February, using an Italian C-130J tanker and a British Merlin, Spoor said. Last week, the Air Force issued another amendment to its request for proposals for the combat search and rescue helicopter. It also postponed the award date until October, three months later than planned. The helicopter is the Air Force's No. 2 acquisition priority after its $35 billion aerial tanker project, which was awarded to Northrop Grumman ( NOC.N ) and EADS ( EAD.PA ) in February.
