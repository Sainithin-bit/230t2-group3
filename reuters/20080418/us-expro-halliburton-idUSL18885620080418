 LONDON  (Reuters) - U.S. oilfield services company Halliburton Co ( HAL.N ) confirmed on Friday that it has been in talks with Expro International Group Plc EXP.L which may lead to it making an offer for its British rival. 

 Halliburton said it was currently conducting due diligence on Expro, which on Thursday said it had agreed a 1.61 billion pounds ($3.21 billion) bid from funds managed by private equity firm Candover ( CDI.L ) and investment bank Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ). (Reporting by Mike Elliott)
