 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Tuesday laid out a plan to "battle" BP's oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico as he sought to assure American he is in command of the crisis. 

 Obama also made an appeal for support of his effort to cut U.S. dependence on fossil fuels, saying now is the time for America to change the way it uses and produces energy. Here is reaction from key U.S. lawmakers. SENATORS JOHN KERRY, MASSACHUSETTS DEMOCRAT AND JOE LIEBERMAN, CONNECTICUT INDEPENDENT, CO-AUTHORS OF COMPREHENSIVE ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION: "This could be a historic leadership moment. President Obama used his first-ever Oval Office address to call for the passage of comprehensive energy and climate legislation. There can be no doubt that the President is rolling up his sleeves to ensure we establish a market mechanism to tackle carbon pollution, create hundreds of thousands of new jobs each year, strengthen energy independence and improve the quality of the air we breathe. We will continue working with colleagues from both sides of the aisle to pass comprehensive reform this summer." SENATOR LAMAR ALEXANDER, CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE REPUBLICAN CONFERENCE: "The president should spend more time focusing on cleaning up and containing the oil spill and less time trying to pass a national energy tax that will drive jobs overseas looking for cheap energy." SENATE MAJORITY LEADER HARRY REID (DEMOCRAT): "President Obama presented a path to energy independence in his speech tonight that strengthens our economy and protects our environment. He made a compelling case that America cannot delay our pursuit of a national clean energy strategy that makes us more competitive globally." HOUSE SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI (DEMOCRAT): "Last June, the House passed a bill to create clean energy jobs here in America, protect consumers, reduce pollution and help free us from our dangerous dependence on dirty foreign fuels while ensuring our national security. Moving forward, we must complete this legislation and invest in a clean energy future founded on American innovation and the skill of our workers." HOUSE REPUBLICAN LEADER JOHN BOEHNER: "President Obama should not exploit this crisis to impose a job-killing national energy tax on struggling families and small businesses. Both parties should be working together to craft responsible solutions in response to this disaster. There's nothing responsible or reasonable about a national energy tax that will raise energy costs and destroy more American jobs." SENATOR DAVID VITTER, LOUISIANA REPUBLICAN: Vitter said the president was still falling short "when it comes to the military chain of command type" and the sense of urgency that Louisianans want to see from federal agency. "I was also disappointed that the president did not address (lifting the offshore drilling) moratorium and my suggestion that we conduct rigorous immediate safety inspections in lieu of the blanket moratorium that is already starting to impact our reeling coastal economy. I have organized a meeting with Department of Interior Secretary Ken Salazar tomorrow with other Gulf state members of Congress to push for inspections over the current moratorium." SENATOR MARY LANDRIEU, LOUISIANA DEMOCRAT: "I firmly believe that BP should establish an escrow account to compensate all individuals, businesses and communities in the Gulf Coast who have suffered damages because of this spill. But, it must be done in a way that ensures BP remains viable enough to pay every penny of what they owe to those who have been affected by this horrific spill and tragedy." CONGRESSMAN DOC HASTINGS, SENIOR REPUBLICAN ON HOUSE NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE: "There is an ongoing crisis in the Gulf and the priorities of the Administration should be simple: stop the leak and cleanup the oil. Such a devastating crisis shouldn't be used as leverage to push a cap-and-trade national energy tax that will send energy prices through the roof and send American jobs overseas." SENATOR TOM CARPER, DELAWARE DEMOCRAT, CHAIRMAN OF SENATE SUBCOMMITTEE ON CLEAN AIR: "I welcome the President's call for Congress to pass clean energy and clean air legislation this year. If there is any silver-lining that we can take from this devastating spill, I hope that it will be a wake-up call for America to get serious about pursuing clean, renewable sources of energy right here at home."
