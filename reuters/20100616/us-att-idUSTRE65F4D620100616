 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - AT&T Inc said on Wednesday that it was suspending preordering of the next Apple Inc iPhone while it tries to meet the fulfill number of orders it has already received. 

 AT&T, the exclusive U.S. provider for iPhone, said orders of the iPhone 4 on Tuesday, the first day of online preorders, were 10 times higher than for the iPhone 3G S last year. The company said that availability of additional inventory would determine if it can resuming taking orders. Heavy demand caused technical problems on the AT&T and Apple website on Tuesday, leading some consumers to instead try ordering the phones at stores. AT&T did not comment on its technology problems or complaints about consumer privacy breaches in a short statement it issued on Wednesday. (Reporting by  Sinead Carew ; editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
