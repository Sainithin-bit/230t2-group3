 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Housing starts fell 10 pct, more than an expected fall of 3.3 pct, in May to their lowest level in five months in Commerce Department data on Wednesday. 

 A popular homebuyer tax credit had buoyed construction activity over the past two months but expired in April. Housing starts dropped to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 593,000 units, the lowest level since December. The percentage decline of 10 pct was the biggest in 14 months. April's housing starts were revised down to show a 3.9 percent increase, which was previously reported as a 5.8 percent rise. Compared to May last year, starts were up 7.8 percent. New building permits, which give a sense of future home construction, dropped 5.9 percent to a 574,000-unit pace in May, the lowest in a year. That followed a 10.9 percent drop in April and compared to analysts' forecasts for a rise to 630,000 units. Analysts believe the pullback in housing will be temporary, citing the gradual improvement in the economy. Demand for loans to buy homes rebounded from 13-year lows last week. In other data, the U.S. producer price index fell in May as the cost of energy plunged, buying the Federal Reserve some time to maintain its ultra-low interest rate policy. The Labor Department on said on Wednesday its producer price index, which measures costs at the wholesale level, fell 0.3 percent last month. Compared to a year earlier, prices rose 5.3 percent overall. But the core reading excluding food and energy climbed just 1.3 percent, slightly above forecasts but still near the lower bound of the U.S. central bank's presumed comfort range. ANALYSTS COMMENTS: KURT KARL, CHIEF US ECONOMIST, SWISS RE, NEW YORK: "Lousy permits, lousy starts. It's just not looking very good and I'm not surprised to see that markets are reacting negatively to the data. Still, despite the drop in May, which is usually a good month, we are still up substantially year on year. Bottom line, we are going up very slowly and in a very volatile environment." DAN COOK, SENIOR MARKET ANALYST AT IG MARKETS IN CHICAGO: "I'm glad I'm not in the construction industry. These numbers are not good. There's too much inventory, and it's going to take a while for the industry to work its way through that. It's going to be a long time before starts begin to pick up, probably a few years. "As for producer prices, I don't think we have anything to worry about on inflation, but that's only because we have so many other challenges."
