 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - The European Commission on Wednesday denied a newspaper report that the European Union, the IMF and the U.S. Treasury were drawing up a liquidity plan for Spain including a credit line of up to 250 billion euros ($335 billion). 

 The report, in the newspaper El Economista, was "very bizarre," Commission spokesman Amadeu Altafaj said. "I can firmly deny it," the spokesman said. (Reporting by  Dale Hudson )
