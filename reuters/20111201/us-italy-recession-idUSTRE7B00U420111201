 ROME  (Reuters) - Italy's economy risks slipping into recession, Industry Minister Corrado Passera said on Thursday. 
 "It's a difficult moment and the risk is that we slip back into a recession like the one we had in 2008, even if it's not all our fault, just as it was not then," Passera said in a speech to retailers. (Reporting By  Alberto Sisto , writing by Steve Scherer)
