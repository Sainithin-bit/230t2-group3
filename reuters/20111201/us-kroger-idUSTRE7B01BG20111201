 (Reuters) - Kroger Co ( KR.N ), the biggest U.S. supermarket chain, raised its forecast for 2011 earnings, helped by strong sales increases at established stores. 
 The company now expects earnings for the year of $1.95 to $2.00 a share, up from its previous forecast of $1.85 to $1.95. Analysts on average had forecast $1.96, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Shares of the company, which owns chains that include Ralphs and Food 4 Less, rose 1.1 percent in early trading on Thursday. Kroger also narrowed its forecast for identical-supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, to 4.5 to 5 percent for 2011. Its prior call for a rise of 4 percent to 5 percent.

Kroger's fiscal third-quarter net income was $195.9 million, or 33 cents per share, compared with $202.2 million, or 32 cents per share, in the year-earlier quarter. Analysts, on average, were looking for 32 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company booked an inventory-related charge of $61.6 million in the latest quarter, versus $11.5 million in the year-earlier period. Sales, including fuel, rose 10.3 percent to $20.6 billion. Identical-supermarket sales rose 5 percent, excluding fuel.
