GREECE: POLITICS: -- Private and public sector unions GSEE and ADEDY, representing about half the cousignalingillionlabororce, went on an austerity strike on December 1. It is the first major labor protest since Greece's new coalition government under Lucas Papademos took over, signaling that labor unions will not soften their stance against EU/IMF-imposed cutbacks. -- Greece's parliament votes on next year's budget on December 6. The budget, which projects the economy will stay in recession for a fifth year, does not foresee new austerity provided that measures taken so far yield the targeted results. -- The main goal is to get to a primary budget surplus, with revenues exceeding spending minus debt maintenance costs, so Greece can start digging itself out from under a debt load that exceeds 30,000 euros for every Greek. -- Greece is awaiting the disbursement of an 8 billion euro tranche under its first 110 billion euro bailout as it faces bond redemptions starting on Dec 19. Eurogroup ministers agreed to release their portion of the aid payment, necessary to help Athens stave off the immediate threat of default. The money is expected to be released by mid-December. GOVERNMENT DEBT SUPPLY: -- Greece's debt agency needs to roll over a total of 4.0 billion euros of T-bills in December: 2 billion euros of 6-month paper mature on December 16 and 2 billion in 3-month T-bills mature on December 23. -- Greece also has 2.7 billion euros of bonds maturing in December: 1.17 billion due on December 19, 980 million on December 22, and 715 million on December 30. -- December 9 - Debt agency sets amount of 6-month T-bills it will auction on Dec 13. DATA: -- December 8 - November Consumer inflation data -- December 8 - September Unemployment, October Industrial data ITALY: -- Prime Minister Mario Monti on December 5 will unveil his government's emergency budget-cutting plans and measures to spur growth in one of the world's most sluggish economies as he strives to restore investor confidence in Italy's ability to reduce its huge debt. -- On the same day, Bank of Italy Governor Ignazio Visco will deliver a speech in Florence about the country's banking system, as the crisis is cutting lenders' access to fresh cash. -- Monti will meet U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner in Milan on December 7, sources said. -- Monti, a former European commissioner, said that there needed to be a swift clarification of the roles of the European Central Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the euro zone's bailout fund to resolve escalating debt turmoil. He has pledged to play an active role in forging the political consensus needed to resolve the crisis. -- After Italian borrowing costs hit a euro lifetime high of almost 8 percent, sources in Washington and Brussels told Reuters that the country was in preliminary discussions with the IMF about financial support. A 400-billion-euro contingency package was being discussed, one source said. Monti denied that the IMF had offered Italy a bailout, and that there were any talks at all. -- Italian 10-year yields dropped below 7 percent on Thursday, and the spread with the benchmark bund narrowed to less than 500 basis points, giving the country a respite from borrowing costs that are widely considered unsustainable in the long term. POLITICS: -- Among the first measures the government may introduce is a property tax that was abolished in 2008, which would probably be combined with an increase in the state's appraisal of real estate values. There could also be a further increase in value added tax (VAT), which was already raised to 21 percent from 20 percent earlier this year. Some of the revenue from the tax increases probably will be used to lower labor costs. -- Italy will implement and strengthen austerity measures promised by the previous government, Labor Minister Elsa Fornero said Thursday. She also pledged to make an "incisive" and fair overhaul of the pension system. DEBT ISSUES: December 6 - Treasury to announce the amount of short-term bills to be auctioned on December 12, and to detail the maturities of medium- and long-term bonds to be auctioned on December 14.

It has poured nearly 17 billion euros of state funds into its four remaining lenders, bringing the total amount of capital provided by the government to nearly 63 billion euros.
