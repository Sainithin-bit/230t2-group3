 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Live Nation Inc ( LYV.N ) reported lower net income, citing costs related to a new ticket service, but beat expectations as the concert promoter posted increases in both ticket sales and live events. 

 Live Nation, which is moving more directly into selling tickets and representing artists, said its second-quarter net income fell to $1.2 million, or 2 cents per share, versus a net profit of $9.9 million, or 15 cents per share, a year ago. Revenue rose to $1.16 billion from $986.3 million. Analysts on average had forecast that the company would post a net loss of 15 cents a share on revenues of $1.05 billion. "History has shown that even in a recession, consumers go to shows. The concert industry and Live Nation are having a strong summer," said Michael Rapino, President and Chief Executive of Live Nation. The number of live concerts produced in the second quarter of 2008 rose 42 percent from a year earlier, it said. Rapino said the company was on track to launch its ticketing business in 2009 after it ends a long-term partnership with Ticketmaster, which was recently spun off from parent IAC/InterActiveCorp ( IACI.O ). Company officials said they have earmarked $15 million this year to spend on the new ticketing system that should handle an expected 20 million tickets worldwide and will eventually compete directly with Ticketmaster for third party contracts at venues and festivals not owned by Live Nation. Live Nation has made headlines in the last year with its high profile moves beyond concert promotion to sign established artists like Madonna, U2 and Jay-Z to recording contracts and merchandising deals. The strategy to evolve into a 360-degree music company has ruffled feathers in the music industry and even caused conflict within the ranks of Live Nation's own management. In June, former chairman Michael Cohl stepped down from the board over a disagreement with Rapino because he wanted Live Nation to increase the pace at which it signs up big name artists. Cohl is now a consultant with the company. (Reporting by  Sue Zeidler ; editing by Carol Bishopric)
