 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Upscale retailer Saks Inc .SKS.N said on Thursday July sales at stores open at least a year fell a greater-than-expected 5.3 percent, sending its stock down. 

 Analysts had forecast Saks same-store sales to decline 0.1 percent, according to Thomson Reuters Estimates. In June Saks said it expected modestly negative comparable store sales for the second quarter. Saks said quarterly sales fell 3.6 percent to $663.1 million. Saks operates 54 Saks Fifth Avenue stores, 48 Saks Off 5th stores, Club Libby Lu specialty stores and saks.com. Saks shares were down 33 cents, or 3.23 percent, at $9.90 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by  Sarah Coffey , editing by Dave Zimmerman)
