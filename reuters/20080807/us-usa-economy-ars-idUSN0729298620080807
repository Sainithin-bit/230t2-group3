 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc. has agreed to buy back more than $7 billion of illiquid auction-rate securities from investors by November 5 and pay $100 million in penalties, according to a settlement with New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced on Thursday. 

 In a separate statement, the SEC said it is continuing its investigation into the ARS matter.  KEY POINTS: * The repurchase agreement applies to Citigroup's retail customers, charities and small-to-mid-sized businesses. * The reimbursements will go to more than 40,000 customers nationwide.  COMMENTS: PAUL MATUS, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, SMITH AFFILIATED CAPITAL  CORP., NEW YORK: "The retail people will at least get their par back. Everyone is going to be forced to settle with retail investors." "This is going to hurt the dealers. They have to buy the stuff back and either take some loss on them or restructure them." "It does make it more expensive to borrow on the front end. It's going to be hard to revive this market. Issuers are being forced out the curve with their borrowing. That puts more supply on the back end than the front end." TIM MCGREGOR, DIRECTOR, MUNICIPAL FIXED INCOME, NORTHERN  TRUST, CHICAGO: "I guess probably this is the start of the solution to the problem," as other banks likely will follow suit. "This is going to have an effect in our world strategically...The money you'd put to work in auction rate is not the money you'd typically put in stocks, it's a different (risk) category, which points more toward municipals. If everybody gets all their auction rate (debt) all of a sudden, they're going to need something to spend it on, other than gas." "...It'll be interesting to see what they go into, the yield curve is so steep, you should see a pretty good flow...They may extend out the yield curve." Asked if other auction rate issuers now might be more inclined not to restructure their debt, he replied: "The ones that are out there are the ones with low yields. Yields and low and the auctions are failing (so) those issuers aren't necessarily in hurry to restructure. They're probably happy with a low rate. From the issuer standpoint, they don't really care if Citi holds them (the auction rate debt) or XYZ company." CECILIA GONDOR, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, THOMAS J HERZFELD  ADVISORS INC, MIAMI: "Shifting the ownership of these auction preferreds from the small investors to Citigroup and other brokers could take some of the pressure off the closed-end fund issuers to refinance the auction preferreds as soon as possible." WILLIAM BELLAMY, DIRECTOR, FIXED INCOME, THOMPSON, SIEGEL &  WALMSLEY, RICHMOND, VIRGINIA: "Today's announcement has more impact on the individual equities of the firms involved than on the fixed income market." "My overall view is that the issue here is what was said when they (the auction-rate securities) were sold. The risk is not a credit risk at all: it is a liquidity risk and maturity risk people have taken on." "Going forward, it changes the market. People have to do a little bit more due diligence on the securities they are selling and buying: that's the real issue." "You used to just see the rating and take things for granted. Now you have to look at the prospectus and issues that may affect these securities." WILLIAM SMITH, PRESIDENT, SMITH ASSET MANAGEMENT INC, NEW  YORK: "All these guys who did these auction-rate securities -- what they said versus what they were is wrong and now they have to pay the piper. It's just one more product that's blown up in the face of the investment banks." On the $100 million in penalties: "It's about what they pay (top Citigroups official) Robert Rubin. So Citigroup writing a check for $100 million to these guys (New York Attorney General) is not that bad." "The problem is they've got to take all these billions of dollars on the balance sheet again. It's just more of the same." The auction-rate securities market "is dead." BRIAN YELVINGTON, ANALYST, CREDITSIGHTS, NEW YORK "It's really a face-saving attempt." "The people who bought auction-rate securities are primarily retail clients, but what we're seeing is face saving. If Citi is able to pull this off, the other banks that have sponsored these programs could be under pressure to do something similar." "It puts pressure on the other players like UBS, HSBC, Merrill Lynch, to do the same thing." The buying back of securities "looks like it is bigger than we would have thought - $7 billion versus an expected $5 billion to $6 billion." "It is an individual investor move. They aren't buying back ARS from larger institutional investors at all. I think it will definitely put pressure on other firms in the ARS market to settle up with regulators and provide some liquidity to retail investors." Yelvington said that news that "up to $12 billion will eventually be bought is definitely going to pressure other banks to do the same."  MARKET REACTION: * Citigroup shares fall 2.5 percent from about $19.50 before the Cuomo press conference to about $19 now. On the session, the stock is down 4 percent from Wednesday's closing price of $19.70.
