 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Gap Inc ( GPS.N ) said on Thursday sales at stores open at least a year fell 11 percent in July as it cleared summer goods to prepare for fall deliveries. 

 But the retailer boosted its forecast for full-year profit and forecast second-quarter earnings above Wall Street estimates, saying it delivered merchandise margins significantly above last year. Analysts, on average, had been expecting the San Francisco-based clothing retailer to post a same-stores sales decrease of 7 percent in July, according to Thomson Reuters Estimates. Gap, which runs Banana Republic, Old Navy and its namesake Gap stores, said it expects a profit of 30 cents to 31 cents a share for the second quarter. Analysts' average forecast was 23 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. "We are pleased that we achieved bottom-line earnings growth this quarter," the company said on a recorded call. For the year, Gap now expects profit of $1.30 to $1.35 a share, compared with its previous forecast of $1.20 to $1.27. (Reporting by  Karen Jacobs ; editing by John Wallace)
