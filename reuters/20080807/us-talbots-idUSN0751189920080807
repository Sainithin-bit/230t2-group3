 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Women's apparel retailer Talbots Inc TLB.N posted a bigger-than-expected decline in quarterly sales on Thursday due to a change in the timing of a clearance event at its namesake stores and deep discounts at its J. Jill chain. 

 Talbots, which had credit problems earlier this year, also said it expects to be in compliance with its debt covenants for the second quarter and still expects to report a net loss for the full year. Talbots said sales in the second quarter, ended August 2, fell 7.7 percent to $528 million. Sales at stores open at least a year fell 12 percent, with an 11.7 percent decline at Talbots and a 13.2 percent decline at J. Jill. Chief Executive Officer Trudy Sullivan blamed the poor sales on a weak response to the chains' summer clearance events as well as a shift in the timing of sale events at Talbots and more aggressive markdowns at J. Jill. The company, majority-owned by Japan's Aeon Co Ltd ( 8267.T ), stood by its forecast for 2008 earnings from ongoing core operations of 47 cents to 52 cents per share, and a net loss of 7 cents to 17 cents per share. "We remain cautious about the retail sector, given the continued uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment and the consumer's judicious purchasing behavior," Sullivan said in a statement.
