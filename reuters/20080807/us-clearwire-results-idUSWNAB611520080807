 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Clearwire Corp CLWR.O posted a wider quarterly loss as costs rose, but revenue grew as the provider of high-speed wireless Internet service added new subscribers. 

 The company, founded by wireless pioneer Craig McCaw, said on Thursday that it had a second-quarter loss of $199.1 million, or $1.21 per share, compared with a loss of $118.1 million, or 72 cents per share, in the year ago quarter. Excluding certain impairment losses and transaction-related expenses, Clearwire posted a loss of 98 cents a share compared with average analyst expectations for a loss of 93 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Clearwire, which uses an emerging high-speed technology known as Wimax, said it is on track to set up a wireless venture with Sprint Nextel Corp ( S.N ) in the fourth quarter. Revenue rose to $58.6 million from $35.5 million a year ago. Analysts on average had expected revenue of $54.58 million, according to Reuters Estimates. Clearwire said it still backs its previously announced target for 2008 revenue of $205 million to $215 million. Clearwire said its customer base had increased to 461,000 at the end of the second quarter from 299,000 a year ago. (Editing by Carol Bishopric,  Richard Chang )
