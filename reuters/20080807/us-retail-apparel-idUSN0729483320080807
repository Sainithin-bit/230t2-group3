 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Most U.S. specialty apparel retailers turned in worse-than-expected July sales as consumers made fewer trips to malls and clothing racks failed to wow female shoppers on tight budgets. 

 But stores with quality products and good values stood out, offering hope for mall-based chains even as consumers rein in their spending amid a weak economy. "The value equation has increased," said Marie Driscoll, an analyst with Standard & Poor's Equity Research. "People want quality but at a value price -- unless it's absolutely special, a must-have signature piece," she added. Among teen retailers, Aeropostale was a clear winner, topping Wall Street estimates with a 13 percent increase in July sales at stores open at least a year. Urban Outfitters also impressed with a 13 percent rise in quarterly same-store sales. Eric Beder, a Brean Murray, Carret & Co analyst, cited "material improvement" in Aeropostale fashions and noted its lower prices compared to main rivals Abercrombie & Fitch and American Eagle Outfitters. Abercrombie and American Eagle both posted same-store sales decreases of 7 percent, worse than analysts expected. At Aeropostale, "the price-to-value right now is outstanding," Beder said. "They've really been able to lever that, especially this quarter and now going back to school, to drive traffic." Christine Chen of Needham & Co said the strength at Urban Outfitters, with its funky inner city fashions, showed the appeal of must-have products was more important than price. "At Urban Outfitters, the price points are actually quite high but you can't get their product anywhere else so the kids are flocking to it," Chen said. Retailers as a whole reported disappointing July sales as tax rebates ran out, suggesting the current back-to-school season was not providing much of a lift. "Except for an American Apparel wardrobe and a new iPhone, the July results and the August outlook indicate that most kids will be returning to school in last year's duds," Lazard Capital Markets analyst Todd Slater wrote in a note. American Apparel, known for brightly colored T-shirts made in Los Angeles, said July same-store sales rose 25 percent. CUTTING COSTS AND INVENTORIES For some apparel retailers, holding down inventories and keeping costs under control helped protect profits, even as fewer shoppers came through their doors. Limited Brands said its same-store sales fell a smaller-than-expected 5 percent as better merchandise margins helped partly offset weak mall traffic. Gap Inc posted an 11 percent same-store sales decline as it cleared summer goods but raised its full-year profit forecast, also citing improved merchandise margins. The apparel company, as part of a turnaround effort, is focusing on boosting profit margins to stabilize business, rather than emphasizing sales growth. Gap has tightened inventories and marked down fewer clothes even as it has cut costs throughout its operations. Price cuts also aided chains such as J.C. Penney, which raised its quarterly profit forecast. Luxury retailers, which had enjoyed a strong run earlier this year, showed signs of increasing weakness as Saks Inc disappointed with a 5.3 percent fall in same-store sales. At Nordstrom, July sales were down 6.1 percent. "The luxury consumer is pulling back as well, not as much as the other customers out there," said Chen. Children's Place disappointed with flat July same-store sales instead of the 7 percent rise analysts had expected. It said a rise in store transactions was offset by a decline in the average purchase price. The children's clothing retailer also said sales grew at its outlet and street stores but fell at its mall stores. Another loser was Chico's FAS, which posted a disappointing 18.5 percent decline in July sales. Driscoll, the S&P Equity analyst, said while Chico's merchandising is improving, its more mature women customers were cutting back. "That woman is in charge of household expenses, she knows what's going on with the value of her real estate, she knows the cost of feeding her family," Driscoll said. "Unless she really needs something, she's not buying." Retail shares were mixed at mid-afternoon, with Aeropostale down 39 cents, or 1.17 percent, at $33.01, while Limited Brands rose 61 cents, or 3.61 percent, to $17.50 on the New York Stock Exchange. J.C. Penney was up $2.85, or 9.02 percent, at $34.45, while Gap edged up 16 cents to $17.12, also on the NYSE.
