 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc has agreed to return to individual investors, small businesses and charities all $7.5 billion of their money from auction rate securities, the Securities and Exchange Commission said on Thursday. 

 Citigroup also agreed to use its "best efforts" to liquidate by the end of 2009 about $12 billion worth of the securities the firm sold to retirement plans and other institutional investors, the SEC said. The SEC said Citi could still face a financial penalty from the agency depending on how it meets its obligations under the settlement. The agency said its investigation into individuals and other entities who participated in the ARS market is continuing. (Reporting by  John Poirier ; Editing by  Tim Dobbyn )
