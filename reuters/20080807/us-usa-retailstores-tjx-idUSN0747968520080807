 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - TJX Cos. Inc. ( TJX.N ) posted a 3 percent rise in July same-store sales on Thursday, slightly below Wall Street estimates, but raised its profit forecast for the second quarter. 

 Analysts, on average, had been expecting the off-price retailer to post a same-store sales increase of 3.3 percent, according to Thomson Reuters Estimates. TJX had previously forecast July same-store sales to be up 3 percent. Analysts say consumers are trading down from department stores to off-price retailers like TJX to help offset rising fuel and food costs which are squeezing already tight budgets. The Framingham, Massachusetts-based retailer, which operates the T.J. Maxx and Marshalls chains, said total July sales rose 6 percent to $1.4 billion. "With robust sales in the month of June, our clearance levels were very lean (in July), which drove the bottom line," TJX Chief Executive Carol Meyrowitz said in a statement. By category, comparable sales of clothing and home fashion were both up 2 percent in July. TJX, which buys excess merchandise in bulk from manufacturers at below-wholesale prices, said it expects to earn 46 cents to 47 cents from continuing operations in the fiscal second quarter. Its previous forecast was 40 cents to 42 cents. (Reporting by  Michele Gershberg , editing by Dave Zimmerman)
