 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc agreed to buy back more than $7 billion of illiquid auction-rate securities and pay a $100 million civil fine to settle charges it marketed the debt fraudulently. 

 The settlement with New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission could pave the way for other settlements stemming from February's meltdown of the $330 billion auction-rate market, which boosted borrowing costs for state and local governments, hurting taxpayers. It will also hinder Citigroup Chief Executive Vikram Pandit's efforts to slash costs and restore the bank's profitability following $17.4 billion of losses in the last three quarters. "It's really a face-saving attempt," said Brian Yelvington, an analyst at CreditSights Inc in New York. "If Citi is able to pull this off, the other banks that have sponsored these programs could be under pressure to do something similar." Thursday's settlement calls for New York-based Citigroup to buy back all illiquid auction-rate debt at face value from retail customers, charities and small- to mid-sized businesses -- a total of some 40,000 customers nationwide -- by November 5. The largest U.S. bank by assets also agreed to fully reimburse all investors who sold auction-rate debt at a loss. It will pay a $50 million penalty to New York and $50 million to the North American Securities Administrators Association. The SEC, meanwhile, said Citigroup will use its "best efforts" to liquidate $12 billion of auction-rate debt sold to institutional investors by the end of 2009. Auction-rate securities have interest rates that reset periodically. The market was once considered safe, but much of it remains frozen after the February meltdown, in which Wall Street brokerages stopped supporting the debt.  Cuomo had accused Citigroup of wrongly telling customers that auction-rate debt was safe, liquid and the equivalent of cash. Various regulators have also accused Merrill Lynch & Co and the Swiss bank UBS AG of fraud in the marketing of the securities. "This is not just a Wall Street issue, this is a Main Street issue," Cuomo said at a press conference. He said the Citigroup settlement "will help restore confidence in this market" and added, "It does justice for consumers." Cuomo said he is investigating other companies' auction-rate sales practices. "Our response will be equivalent to the impact," he said. "We will be working with the other institutional players to bring justice to the situation." Representatives of Merrill and UBS did not immediately return calls seeking comment. In afternoon trading, Citigroup shares were down 75 cents, or nearly 4 percent, to $18.95 on the New York Stock Exchange. CITIGROUP SAYS MAKING PROGRESS Citigroup said in a statement that it was pleased to settle. It said it has made "tremendous progress" adding liquidity, and has redeemed or auctioned at face value more than half of its retail clients' auction-rate holdings. The bank did not admit wrongdoing in agreeing to settle. It estimated the size of the buyback at $7.3 billion. Citigroup has incurred more than $58 billion of write-downs and credit losses since the middle of 2007 as the economy sagged, the housing crisis swelled and capital markets seized up. "It's just one more product that's blown up in the face of the investment banks," said William Smith, president of Smith Asset Management Inc in New York. "The problem is they've got to take all these billions of dollars on the balance sheet." Citigroup was the largest underwriter of auction-rate debt in all but one year this decade, Thomson Financial data show. While Thursday's settlement covers retail investors, analysts said all investors must now regard auction-rate debt with a more wary eye. Some said the market might struggle to regain its equilibrium. "You used to just see the rating and take things for granted," said William Bellamy, director of fixed income at Thompson, Siegel & Walmsley in Richmond, Virginia. "Now you have to look at the prospectus and issues that may affect these securities." In an unrelated settlement, Massachusetts' attorney general said Morgan Stanley has agreed to pay $1.5 million to reimburse two cities that invested in auction-rate securities.
