 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The number of U.S. workers filing new claims for jobless benefits rose 7,000 last week to the highest level in more than 6 years, government data on Thursday showed, but special factors distorted the data again. 

 Initial claims for state unemployment insurance benefits increased to a seasonally adjusted 455,000 in the week ended August 2 from 448,000 the week before, the Labor Department said, marking the highest reading since March 2002. Claims data have been affected for at least the last two weeks by a federal program to extend unemployment benefits to cushion the impact of a slowing economy. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected 423,000 new claims. The Labor Department said that states contacting people they thought were eligible for the extension had discovered that many more than anticipated were in fact entitled to file a normal initial claim. "The claims are high because people are coming into the system who probably would not have filed absent this program," a Labor Department official said. He said it was not possible to estimate what percentage of the increase could be blamed on this factor and warned the impact could be felt for up to six weeks. The dollar slipped after the numbers while U.S. government bonds rose in price as investors bet that the weakness of the labor market would encourage the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates low. Stock index futures extended losses, pointing to a lower open on Wall Street later on Thursday. Economists said the distortion to the data made it tough to be sure what was going on in the labor market, but the general sense of jobs being tough to find was clear. "Anything above 400,000 is in recession range. It does make it easier to call it a recession," said David Wyss, chief economist at Standard & Poor's Ratings Services in New York. Other readings of the jobs market signaled soft conditions. The four-week average of new jobless claims, regarded as a better gauge of underlying labor trends because it irons out week-to-week volatility, jumped to 419,500 from 392,750 the week before. This was the highest since July 2003 and the first time since that year that the four-week moving average had pushed above 400,000. This measure has mounted steadily as the U.S. housing slump chilled growth and crimped hiring. The number of people remaining on the benefits roll after drawing an initial week of aid rose 31,000 to a more-than-forecast 3.311 million in the week ended July 26, the most recent week for which data is available. Analysts estimated so-called continued claims would be 3.28 million. It was the 15th straight week that claims were above 3 million, in a sign that the slowing economy is making it harder for U.S. workers to find jobs.
