 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Warner Music Group WMG.N posted a smaller quarterly loss as improved sales in Europe softened the effects of the slowdown in the global music industry, the company said on Thursday. 

 The world's third-largest music company said its net loss for the third quarter ended on June 30 narrowed to $9 million, or 6 cents a share, from $17 million, or 12 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $848 million from $804 million, although factoring out the benefits of the weak dollar, sales declined 1.1 percent. (Reporting by  Franklin Paul ; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
