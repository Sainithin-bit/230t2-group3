 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The number of U.S. workers filing new claims for jobless benefits rose 7,000 last week to the highest level in 6 years, government data on Thursday showed, but special factors continued to distort the data. 

  KEY POINTS: * Initial claims for state unemployment insurance benefits increased to a seasonally adjusted 455,000 in the week ended Aug 2 from 448,000 the week before, the Labor Department said, marking the highest reading since March 2002.  * Analysts polled by Reuters had expected 423,000 new claims.  * Claims data for several weeks has been indirectly impacted by a federal program to extend unemployment benefits to cushion the impact of a slowing economy.  COMMENTS: MICHELLE MEYER, ECONOMIST, LEHMAN BROTHERS, NEW YORK: "We do see claims staying elevated above 400,000, which suggests a weak labor market and a rising unemployment rate." "What is important is look past the choppiness and bias in the data and what you'll see is a fundamental weakness in the labor market. We'll see the unemployment rate peaking at 6.3 percent next year." MATTHEW MOORE, ECONOMIC STRATEGIST, BANC OF AMERICA  SECURITIES LLC, NEW YORK: "It's certainly not a positive sign but it's not as bad as it looks at first pass." "The seasonals expect not a lot of layoffs this time of year. This time of year you normally get 20 percent fewer initial jobless claims than on average so the Labor Department scales that up by the seasonal, so if you get additional extended benefits they will be inflated by the seasonal as well, because the seasonals are not expecting the extended benefits." SUBODH KUMAR, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, SUBODH KUMAR &  ASSOCIATES, TORONTO: "Clearly the economy is still weak. Some of the stimulus from the tax rebates is coming out. I think the key to watch for is the unemployment number. Once you go above 6 percent, the concerns about recession will go up. But here, I would say the data shows simply that the Fed needs to remain neutral. "As far as the market goes, we're still in a period of extreme volatility. I think there's room for a pullback after the big stock market jump seen after the Fed this week. The big retailers had been the ones holding the economy up, but results are showing that macroeconomic factors are affecting them also. And the write-downs, such as those at AIG, continue to be disappointing and will weigh on financials and stocks more broadly." DAVID WYSS, CHIEF ECONOMIST, STANDARD & POOR'S RATINGS  SERVICES, NEW YORK: "We think one thing that is distorting the number is the extended benefits program that caused a lot of people to reapply. Someone who dropped out and came back in counts so we don't know how many of these people are being counted." "Anything above 400,000 is in recession range. It does make it easier to call it a recession." "The insured unemployment rate at 2.5 percent is consistent with a recession."
