 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Children's Place Retail Stores Inc ( PLCE.O ) said on Thursday its sales at stores open at least a year were flat in July, falling short of Wall Street expectations for a gain. 

 Wall Street had been expected a same-store sales gain of 7 percent, according to Thomson Reuters Estimates. The children's clothing retailer said total sales rose 7 percent to $105.6 million for the four weeks ended Aug 2. For the second quarter, total sales rose 16 percent while same-store sales rose 9 percent, the company said. Children's Place said in July that its chief financial officer was leaving the company, to be replaced by Susan Riley, the executive vice president of finance and administration. The company operates approximately 900 of its namesake stores, following the sell-off of its Disney store chain back to Walt Disney Co ( DIS.N ) this spring. Children's Place has been weighing a possible sale of the company under pressure from its largest shareholder, board member and former chief executive Ezra Dabah, who owns a 17 percent stake in the company.
