 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) said on 
Thursday it expects to spend $900 million over the next few 
years to adjust its manufacturing capacity, including closing 
plants and reducing output. 

  The No. 1 U.S. automaker, in its quarterly report filed 
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, said it plans 
to spend $100 million in 2008, $200 million in 2009, and $600 
million after 2009.  GM, which posted a $15.5 billion net loss in the second 
quarter, announced in July that it planned $10 billion of cost 
cuts, including eliminating white-collar jobs, retiree 
health-care coverage and executive bonuses for 2008.  The company is realigning its North American production to 
reflect a U.S. auto market reeling from an oil shock being 
compared with those of the 1970s. GM plans to close four North 
American truck plants and add shifts at two U.S. plants that 
build more popular cars that get better mileage.  GM also said it expects to spend $300 million in 2008 on 
buyout programs to cut its white-collar costs by 20 percent.  (Reporting by Peoria Gupta; Editing by Braden Riddell)
