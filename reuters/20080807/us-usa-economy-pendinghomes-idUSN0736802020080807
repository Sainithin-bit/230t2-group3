 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. home sales contracts 
signed in June unexpectedly rose across the country, but still 
were well below year-earlier levels, the National Association 
of Realtors said on Thursday. 

 The Pending Home Sales Index, which is based on contracts 
signed in June, was up 5.3 percent to 89.0 from a downwardly 
revised 84.5 in May. It was the highest reading for the index 
since October, when it was at 89.8. 
COMMENTS: MICHELLE MEYER, ECONOMIST, LEHMAN BROTHERS, NEW YORK: "The data came in much better than we were expecting and 
much better than the market was expecting. I think a lot of the 
increase has to do with foreclosure sales. which are selling at 
quicker pace and have a faster turnaround time."
   RONALD SIMPSON, MANAGING DIRECTOR OF GLOBAL CURRENCY 
ANALYSIS, ACTION ECONOMICS, TAMPA, FLORIDA: "The number was better than expected. So far, we've seen 
dollar/yen move to session highs, euro/dollar to session lows. 
Equities have come off their worst levels. I think there are 
still some near-term concern over the economy. Some of the 
retail sales numbers that came in today were worse than 
expected. The initial claims number was pretty ugly. I think 
for now, that's going to limit the upside for the dollar."
   KURT BRUNNER, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, SWARTHMORE GROUP, 
PHILADELPHIA: "Even given that number, I still think there is difficulty 
in the housing market. We may have hit a bottom, but we may be 
more in a kind of a bottoming plateau, let's put it that way, 
versus a big rebound. "I just think that obviously mortgages are still going to 
be difficult to get, there is still going to be defaults, 
affordability is still going to take some time, and improving 
demand will take time too. "There are some bargains out there probably, but I don't 
think we are done yet."  ANDREW RICHMAN, MANAGING DIRECTOR, SUNTRUST'S PERSONAL 
ASSET MANAGEMENT DIVISION, WEST PALM BEACH, FLORIDA: "It (pending home sales) was a little bit higher than 
expected. Looking at the underlying numbers though, we have to 
see how much of that is attributable to bank owned properties 
or foreclosures, which seem to be driving the markets right 
now." "There are some bottom feeders coming in to buy some of 
these homes in distressed situations. How long that will last I 
don't know." PIERRE ELLIS, SENIOR GLOBAL ECONOMIST, DECISION ECONOMICS, 
NEW YORK: "This is telling us that sales have stabilized. This raises 
some hopes that we've flattened out, which doesn't mean the 
problem is solved. "But the inventories of unsold homes remain huge given 
these low sales. Sales have to stop falling before the problem 
can be solved. It's reassuring the fall in the previous month 
was reversed. This number has been running a 7 point range 
since last August and this number is now at the high end."
