 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Barclays Plc ( BARC.L ) won on Wednesday the dismissal of a lawsuit brought by U.S. investors who accused the British bank of failing to disclose and properly account for the risks in its real estate business. 

 The investors had purchased American depositary shares issued by Barclays between April 2006 and April 2008. The plaintiffs alleged the offering materials accompanying the securities misled them about the bank's real estate exposure and misleadingly assured them that Barclays' risk management practices would help it avoid credit market risk.
