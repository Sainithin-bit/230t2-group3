 ROME  (Reuters) - Prices of corn, wheat and other grains can go much higher and current weather patterns are of concern, the United Nations' food agency economist said after its food price index hit a record high in December. 

 "We are concerned, the real reason for concern is the unpredictability," the Food and Agriculture Organisation's economist Abdolreza Abbassian told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday. "There is still room for prices to go up much higher, if for example the dry conditions in Argentina tend to become a drought, and if we start having problems with winterkill in the northern hemisphere for the wheat crops," he said. Winterkill occurs when cold attacks plants seeded, generally in the autumn, for harvesting the following year. Abbassian added that despite high prices, many factors that triggered food riots in 2007/08, such as weak production in poor countries and a sudden surge in crude oil prices, were not currently present, reducing the risk of more turmoil.
