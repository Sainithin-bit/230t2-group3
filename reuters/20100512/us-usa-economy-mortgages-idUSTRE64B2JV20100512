 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. mortgage applications for home purchase loans dropped in the first week after the expiration of popular federal home buyer tax credits, an industry group said on Wednesday, highlighting the vulnerability of the hard-hit housing market to the absence of key support. 

 Existing homeowners, however, came out in droves to refinance loans as interest rates on U.S. 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, the most widely used loan, reached their lowest level since mid-March. The Mortgage Bankers Association said borrowing costs on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, excluding fees, averaged 4.96 percent for the week ended May 7, down 0.06 percentage point from the previous week and the lowest since the week ended March 12. "The recent plunge in rates on U.S. Treasury securities, due to a flight to quality as investors worldwide sought shelter from the Greek debt crisis, benefited U.S. mortgage borrowers last week," Michael Fratantoni, MBA's vice president of research and economics, said in a statement. Mortgage rates are linked to yields on Treasuries and yields on mortgage-backed securities. Yields move inversely to price. The MBA's seasonally adjusted purchase index, a tentative early indicator of home sales, decreased 9.5 percent, the first drop in four weeks. Fratantoni said the government's recently expired home buyer tax credits likely pulled some sales into April that would otherwise have occurred in May or later. Those seeking to take advantage of the $8,000 first-time home buyer tax credit or a $6,500 credit for home owners buying a new residence had to sign purchase contracts by April 30 and have until June 30 to close on the sales. Recent robust data on pending, new and existing home sales show a sector that has benefited smartly from these incentives. Upcoming data will therefore provide key insight into how housing is faring without them. The MBA's seasonally adjusted index of mortgage applications, which includes both purchase and refinance loans, increased 3.9 percent. The four-week moving average of mortgage applications, which smooths the volatile weekly figures, was up 4.4 percent. The MBA's seasonally adjusted index of refinancing applications increased 14.8 percent, the highest in six weeks. Leif Thomsen, chief executive of Mortgage Master in Walpole, Massachusetts, said fears of rising mortgage rates are leading many people to refinance now rather than later. "Rates are still exceptionally low and people, on average, are feeling better about their job situation and their future," he said. "People have been prepared for this day to come and now that it has arrived, they are acting quickly," he said. The MBA said fixed 15-year mortgage rates averaged 4.32 percent, down from 4.34 percent the previous week. Rates on one-year adjustable-rate mortgage, or ARMs, decreased to 6.86 percent from 7.03 percent. (Editing by Kenneth Barry)
