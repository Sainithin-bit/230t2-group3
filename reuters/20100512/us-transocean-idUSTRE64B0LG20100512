 (Reuters) - Swiss-based Transocean Ltd denied allegations late Tuesday that its crew members were asked to sign waivers relating to damage claims soon after its deep water rig exploded off the U.S. gulf coast. 

 Transocean's Deepwater Horizon rig, under contract with BP Plc, exploded and caught fire on April 20 while it was putting the finishing touches on a well about a mile beneath the ocean surface. It sank two days later. The accident, which killed 11 people, has triggered a huge oil spill that is threatening an environmental and economic disaster along the U.S. Gulf Coast. All decisions aboard the rescue boat, the Damon Bankston, were made solely by the U.S. coast guard, Transocean said in a statement. Efforts to transport crew members from the rig to shore were coordinated by the coast guard according to standard maritime procedures, the company said. Transocean said contrary to certain reports, it did not distribute any incident response forms on behalf of Transocean to the crew members at the time of the accident. The crew members were given the standard one page incident report document after they arrived at a hotel and were not forced to fill it in immediately, the company said.
