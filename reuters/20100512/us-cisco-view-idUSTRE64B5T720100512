 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc's ( CSCO.O ) quarterly profit beat Wall Street expectations and Chief Executive John Chambers said the network equipment maker is gaining market share as it emerges from the global downturn. 

 Shares of Cisco edged lower in after-hours trading, as investors waited for Chambers to give his outlook on a conference call later on Wednesday. COMMENTARY MARK MCKECHNIE, ANALYST, BROADPOINT AMTECH "Good solid quarter. Chambers' commentary sounds pretty good -- he's talking about balanced growth across geographies and product segments. He calls this one of the strongest quarters in history for the company. "No one's really addressed the goings on over in Europe. Expectations have been low, but we look forward to hearing what Cisco says about that. That's kind of got everybody a bit on edge." TIM GHRISKEY, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER OF SOLARIS ASSET MANAGEMENT, IN BEDFORD HILLS, NEW YORK "The margin was in line with guidance but we think that was the low end of guidance. "Having said that, both revenues and earnings were very strong, so it was a good solid quarter for a major company that tends to not have big positive surprises any more. "There's some very modest profit taking in the after hours market, selling on the news and on the margin being on the low end of published expectations. "This is one of the major bellwethers and the fact that they surprised on the top and bottom line really is positive for the overall market, even though there might be a little bit of profit taking on the slightly disappointing margin news."
