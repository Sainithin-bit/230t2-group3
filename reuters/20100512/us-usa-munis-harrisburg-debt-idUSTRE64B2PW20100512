 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - City officials in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, are eyeing asset sales, refinancings and other steps to raise $68 million needed in 2010 for debt payments tied to a municipal trash incinerator. 

 The city's mayor has not ruled out an eventual default by Pennsylvania's state capital on the $282 million of incinerator debt, and the city council recently passed a resolution that Harrisburg must look into a Chapter 9 bankruptcy filing before moving to sell or lease any city property. Here are facts about Chapter 9, a rarely used part of federal bankruptcy law meant to shelter America's 19,000 cities, 16,000 towns, 4,000 counties and thousands of other local government entities during financial crises: -- Chapter 9 filings by local governments numbered fewer than 500 in the last 60 years, according to a U.S. courts group's tally. There were around 1.5 million bankruptcy petitions in the United States in 2009, but fewer than a dozen of those were Chapter 9 filings. More than 10,000 were Chapter 11 bankruptcy cases involving U.S. businesses. -- Unlike cases of corporate reorganization, judges overseeing municipal bankruptcies have limited powers and can neither liquidate a local government's assets nor intervene in the day-to-day operations of Chapter 9 debtors providing what are often essential services. -- States such as California are not eligible for Chapter 9 protection against creditors and only two dozen of the 50 U.S. states specifically allow Chapter 9 filings by their local governments. Most states are vague on whether or not they will approve Chapter 9 filings or simply ban them outright. -- Several states, including Pennsylvania, permit Chapter 9 filings by school districts and other local governments only after state officials sign off. -- High-profile Chapter 9 petitions include one by California's Orange County in 1994, Vallejo, California, in 2008, and last year's filing by the New York City Off-Track Betting Corp, an operator of government betting parlors. -- Potential municipal bankruptcy has popped up elsewhere in the past year as local governments struggled with big debt loads and sinking revenue due to the recession. Officials in Jefferson County, Alabama, and in Detroit and its public school system have mentioned the possibility of a bankruptcy filing.
