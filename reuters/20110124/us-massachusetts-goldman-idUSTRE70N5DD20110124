 BOSTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating dealings between former Massachusetts Treasurer Timothy Cahill and a former top aide who worked at Goldman Sachs. 

 Regulators sent subpoenas to the current Massachusetts treasurer late on Friday requesting emails, phone records and other documents related to the  probe, a spokesman for Treasurer Steve Grossman said on Monday. The spokesman, Barry Nolan, said the office is cooperating fully with the request but declined to comment further about exactly what the government is seeking. The Boston Globe, which first reported the subpoena on Monday, said the probe focuses on whether there might have been improper contact between Cahill staff and Neil Morrison, formerly Cahill's first deputy. Cahill was elected state treasurer in 2002, and in 2010, running as an independent, he unsuccessfully tried to unseat Governor Deval Patrick, a Democrat. Morrison, who had deep roots with Cahill, left the Treasurer's office in 2006 to join UBS. He moved on to Goldman Sachs in Boston in 2008, only to be let go in December 2010, because he participated in "outside activities without pre-approval," according to a Financial Industry Regulatory Authority filing. The current investigation appears to shine the spotlight on the relationship between Morrison and Cahill's team as the treasurer mounted his campaign for the Massachusetts governorship. Goldman helped underwrite some of the bonds sold by the state and Morrison helped negotiate a $456 million bond deal in 2010 with a state water-pollution control board that Cahill chaired and operated within the Treasurer's office. Goldman Sachs earned an estimated $2 million from the deal. The probe allegedly also focuses on an email Morrison, who was listed as a "top political adviser" by Cahill, reportedly sent during work hours from a private email account to consultants working on Cahill's gubernatorial campaign, the Globe said. If Morrison broke any rules he could be fined and possibly lose his broker's license. A Goldman spokesman declined to comment. Morrison could not be reached. Goldman is no stranger to intense scrutiny from securities regulators, which it has tried to deflect in recent weeks with pledges for more openness. In April 2010 the SEC sued Goldman, alleging fraud over its marketing of a subprime mortgage product, a case the company ultimately settled for $550 million last July. Goldman later got in trouble with regulators for not moving fast enough to disclose that probe. British and U.S. authorities fined the company as a result. More recently the firm got caught in a misstep over a private investment in social network Facebook it marketed to top clients. The company ended up excluding U.S. clients from the deal for fear of running afoul of U.S. securities laws.
