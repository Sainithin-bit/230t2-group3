 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Texas Instruments Inc fourth quarter profit and revenue rose as weak demand for chips used in consumer products like televisions appeared to be offset by strong sales to industrial customers. 

 TI, whose chips are used in products ranging from cellphones to cars, posted a profit of $942 million, or 78 cents per share compared with $655 million, or 52 cents per share in the same quarter the year before. The latest quarter included a 14 cents per share unusual gain from a product line sale and a tax benefit. Revenue rose to $3.53 billion from $3 billion in the year-ago quarter and compared with the company's forecast for revenue of $3.43 billion to $3.57 billion. TI shares were down 2 percent at just under $34 in late trade after closing at $34.65 on the New York stock Exchange. (Reporting by  Sinead Carew ; Editing by  Bernard Orr )
