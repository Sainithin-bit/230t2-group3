 BANGALORE  (Reuters) - Fifth-largest U.S. steelmaker Steel Dynamics Inc ( STLD.O ), whose quarterly results trailed Wall Street, forecast 2011 sales above estimates, saying the recovering economy will boost volumes at its key segments steel manufacturing and metals recycling. 

 Global steel production rose 15 percent in 2010, driven by growth in emerging regions and improving manufacturing in the developed world. [nLDE70K1GI] Last week, ratings agency S&P said the worst was behind for the sector. On a conference call with analysts, Steel Dynamics said it saw sales of up to $8 billion for 2011. Analysts on average are looking for $7.6 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "The prospects for Steel Dynamics are pretty good for the first half," analyst Luke Folta of Longbow Research said, adding that prices for steel have picked up dramatically toward the end of the fourth quarter. Steel Dynamics' outlook lifted its shares, which were down 2 percent in early-morning trade. They were up 2 percent at $18.10 in afternoon trade. "We anticipate substantially improved first quarter for all our segments compared to fourth quarter results," the Fort Wayne, Indiana-based company said. Steel Dynamics, whose peers include AK Steel Holding Corp ( AKS.N ), U.S. Steel ( X.N ) and Schnitzer Steel Industries Inc ( SCHN.O ), sees end-markets like energy, automotive and transportation to drive up steel consumption in 2011. However, it sees soft to very moderate near-term demand growth in residential and non-residential construction -- one of the largest consumers of steel. Sales at the company's steel manufacturing segment, which contributed about 60 percent to fourth-quarter revenue, fell by a quarter to $979 million, sequentially. October-December earnings were 7 cents a share, excluding items. Analysts expected 8 cents a share. (Reporting by Vaishnavi Bala in Bangalore; Editing by Anne Pallivathuckal, Maju Samuel)
