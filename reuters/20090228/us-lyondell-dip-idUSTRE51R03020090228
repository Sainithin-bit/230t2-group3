 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A federal bankruptcy judge on Friday approved an $8 billion bankruptcy loan for oil and chemical maker Lyondell Chemical Co ACCELC.UL. 

 U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Robert Gerber of the Southern District said Lyondell needed the funding to be able to emerge from bankruptcy. Lyondell will use the "debtor-in-possession," or DIP, loan to fund its operations while the company reorganizes. "There can be know doubt that the debtors (Lyondell) absolutely need the requested funding, without which they would have to be liquidated," Gerber told the court. Gerber said the agreement had been "negotiated in good faith" in explaining his decision. During a three-day DIP hearing, one of the company's lenders, ABN AMRO, which said it holds about $3.4 billion in outstanding claims against the company, threatened to walk away from the deal, saying that the loan jeopardizes existing liens on Lyondell assets. The case took three days as lenders and creditors put forth arguments on certain terms, including its one year maturity, with lenders saying that period was sufficient given the riskiness of the loan, and creditors saying Lyondell needs flexibility given the time needed to right itself. Gerber said the difficult credit markets had been a factor in his approval of the DIP loan. Lyondell is part of the U.S. units of LyondellBasell Industries ACCEIN.UL, which filed for bankruptcy in January under the weight of a heavy debt load and dropping demand for its products. It is owned by Russian-born investor Len Blavatnik through New York-based Access Industries and is based in the Netherlands. The case is In re: Lyondell Chemical Co., 09-10023, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York.
