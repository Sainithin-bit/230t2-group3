 ZURICH  (Reuters) - Nestle ( NESN.VX ) sees no major acquisitions in the future, just potential bolt-on buys, its chief executive said on Wednesday as the group digests its recent medical and infant nutrition purchases. 

 "It is now time to consolidate," Chief Executive Peter Brabeck told CNBC television in an interview. "We do not see any major acquisition coming up." When asked whether Nestle was interested in acquiring Godiva from Campbell Soup Co. ( CPB.N ), Brabeck said the group was focused in the areas of nutrition and health and that other areas -- while they would be looked at -- were not a priority.
