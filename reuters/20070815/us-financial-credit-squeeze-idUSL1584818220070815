 FRANKFURT/OTTAWA  (Reuters) - Central banks in Europe and Japan on Wednesday mopped up cash poured into money markets to quell a global credit storm, but in Canada and the United States there were more measures to shore up liquidity. 

 The Bank of Canada stepped in after a day on the sidelines of the money market, and the Federal Reserve added $7 billion in temporary reserves as losses in the U.S. subprime mortgage market sent Wall Street stocks slumping again. For the first time since it began pumping extra cash into Europe's money markets on Thursday, the European Central Bank gave no extra short-term money to keep the financial system operating smoothly. Central banks in Japan and Switzerland actively drained cash from their local markets after injections of liquidity in the past week. However, emerging market Asian central banks took steps to smooth trade in the region's currency markets as ongoing credit fears hit stocks and sent the yen to a 4-1/2-month high, as investors unwound carry trades involving borrowing in yen to invest in higher yielding securities elsewhere. Analysts warned that the credit squeeze and liquidity problems were spreading. "The turmoil in financial markets continues with a greater contagion in Asia, emerging markets and investment grade credit," Tullett Prebon G7 economist Lena Komileva said. Signs of credit bottlenecks have led investors to scale back expectations for interest-rate increases or, in the case of the Fed, have raised expectations for an ease. Interest rate futures prices suggest traders see a certainty that the U.S. central bank will lower borrowing costs by at least a quarter-percentage point at its next meeting on September 18, and a chance it may even cut rates sooner. St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President William Poole, however, said there was no need for an emergency rate cut and said that so far it appeared the economy was faring fine. "It's premature to say that this upset in the market is changing the course of the economy in any fundamental way," he said in an interview with Bloomberg. "Obviously, there could be an impact, but we have to rely on some real evidence." STOCKS STUMBLE The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed nearly 170 points, or 1.3 percent, to 12,861, its first close below 13,000 since April 24, as investors wondered who would be the next victim as credit dries up for all but the best of borrowers. The Fed's action was modest compared with the $38 billion it poured into markets on Friday, the largest amount injected since just after the September 11, 2001, attacks. But dealers said it was a reminder the Fed remained alert to market needs. The Bank of Canada injected C$350 million ($330 million) of repurchase funds and left the market flush with cash at the end of the day. It left a C$500 million balance in the Large Value Transfer System, which allows easy balance settlements by banks, up from the normal C$25 million. It said it plans to do the same on Thursday. "This is helpful and may alleviate some of the pressure. It may not be the end of the nervousness that we see, but it's a positive step in the right direction," said Mark Chandler, fixed income strategist at RBC Capital Markets. Central banks around the world have pumped hundreds of billions of dollars of extra funds into markets in the past week to ease worries about the widening impact of losses in the U.S. subprime mortgage market which threatened to paralyze credit markets. But ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet said on Tuesday money market conditions had progressively returned to normal, although the central bank would continue to watch developments closely. Central banks in Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines were suspected of intervening once again on Wednesday though, selling U.S. dollars to slow the declines in their currencies. Traders said Bank Indonesia had sold an estimated $800 million to $900 million to stop the rupiah  IDR=  from falling beyond 9,400 per dollar. The Malaysian ringgit  MYR=  fell to a five-month low and the Philippine peso  PHP=  to its lowest in more than a month.
