 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Amgen Inc ( AMGN.O ), the world's biggest biotech company by sales, said on Wednesday it would cut 2,200 to 2,600 jobs, or 12 percent to 14 percent of its staff, as it grapples with declining sales of two best selling anemia drugs. 

 The company also cut its 2007 adjusted earnings guidance from $4.28 per share to a range of $4.13 to $4.23 per share. Sales for its anemia drug franchise brought in roughly half of last year's revenue and are under pressure due to concern over safety and closer scrutiny of their use by government insurance programs. Amgen, based in Thousand Oaks, California, said it expects to finish most cuts by 2008. Amgen expects paring its workforce and other moves, such as closing certain production operations and prioritizing its research and development efforts, to reduce capital expenditures by about $1.9 billion during 2007 and 2008 and said it would book charges of $600 million to $700 million during that same period. Aranesp, one of the drugs, was the top revenue producing biotech drug in the United States last year with sales of $4.1 billion. Aranesp sales fell 19 percent to $578 million in the second quarter after U.S. regulators put strict safety warnings on anemia drugs made by Amgen and Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ.N ) and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) began restricting instances in which they would pay for their use by cancer patients. "The magnitude of the cost cuts is certainly significant, but mostly in line with (Wall) Street expectations," said Cowen & Co analyst Eric Schmidt. Some analysts also think sales of Amgen's older anemia drug Epogen, used to treat people with chronic kidney disease, are due to fall as regulators and CMS probe the use of anemia drugs in dialysis treatment. Bill Tanner, an analyst at Leerink Swann, noted that the restructuring went beyond staff reductions. "It suggests that perhaps their expectation for product sales is they are not really going to bounce back ... it does certainly suggest that they think that their revenue opportunities -- especially for those (anemia) drugs -- has probably been permanently impaired," Tanner said. While Amgen is among the nation's oldest biotech companies, analysts said it is now grappling with issues more common to big pharmaceutical companies. The company now supports hefty research and development spending as well as high marketing and sales costs associated with developing and supporting blockbuster drugs. Like many big pharma companies, Amgen is also facing increased competition, looming patent expirations on current products and difficulty finding future revenue drivers. "As far as I'm concerned, Amgen is a Big Pharma," said Les Funtleyder, a healthcare analyst at Miller Tabak in New York. "They have a big infrastructure. They have a reliance on a couple of core products. Their pipeline is so-so. They're a huge company in terms of market cap. And they even may be subject to some generic competition," Funtleyder said. Amgen shares rose to $51.03 in extended trade after closing down 73 cents at $50.59 on Nasdaq. The company's stock has fallen about 26 percent this year, compared with the American Stock Exchange Biotech Index's .BTK decline of 0.1 percent. As Amgen has depended on its anemia franchise, analysts said smaller rivals like Genentech Inc DNA.N have turned out innovative products that will drive growth. As a result, Genentech has a current market value of $75.8 billion, about $20 billion higher than Amgen, which analysts expect to have 2007 sales of $14.7 billion versus Genentech's expected sales of $11.8 billion.
