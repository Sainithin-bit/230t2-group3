 AMSTERDAM/STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - Iceland's Kaupthing Bank KAUP.IC agreed on Wednesday to buy NIBC for about 3 billion euros ($4.1 billion) in cash and shares, but left out the Dutch merchant bank's loss-making U.S. subprime portfolio. 

 Kaupthing Chief Executive Hreidar Mar Sigurdsson said NIBC would help diversify the Icelandic bank's revenues, bring economies of scale, and give it a strong position in the Benelux region and a foothold in Germany. "This is an excellent strategic fit," Sigurdsson said on a conference call with analysts. The purchase of NIBC follows a flurry of buyouts in the Netherlands. Dutch bank ABN AMRO AAH.AS is the subject of competing bids, and food group Numico NUMCc.AS and chemicals distributor Univar UNIV.AS have agreed to be acquired. Kaupthing, Iceland's biggest banking group, said it would not take on NIBC's exposure to the U.S. subprime market. This will remain with NIBC's owners, a consortium of some 80 investors led by private equity firm J.C. Flowers. Sigurdsson said the two banks had a complementary focus on small and medium-sized businesses and the deal would diversify Kaupthing's balance sheet, geographical footprint and revenues. It will also give Kaupthing a base to build on in Germany, which "could be an interesting deposit market for us," he added. Kaupthing, advised by Lehman Brothers, is paying 12.7 times NIBC's net earnings for the past 12 months. European banks are, on average, trading at around 10.5 times estimated 2007 earnings, according to rating agency Moody's. "It is not particularly expensive," said Fox-Pitt, Kelton analyst Kim Bergoe. "It's a good strategic fit with the group." Kaupthing shares were down 0.27 percent at 1,098 Icelandic crowns at 11:15 a.m. EDT. CREDIT RATING Moody's said the deal could hurt Kaupthing's credit. "Moody's decision to place the ratings of Kaupthing on review for possible downgrade reflects the weaker financial fundamentals of NIBC and the execution risk involved in the proposed acquisition," analysts at the rating agency said. The deal needs to be approved by regulators and is expected to close in the fourth quarter or early next year. NIBC, which earlier this month abandoned the idea of making an initial public offering, announced a 137 million euro loss on its U.S. asset-backed securities portfolio last week. The bank said it would sell the portfolio at a fair market value of $528 million to a new company owned by the sellers. This move would be financed by a dividend of $292 million and a senior loan facility of $236 million made by Kaupthing, it said. Banks in Europe have been looking to bulk up recently to capture economies of scale and broaden product portfolios. Icelandic banks have been especially active in recent years, looking to broaden revenue and deposit bases and reduce exposure to the volatile economy of the remote North Atlantic island. After digesting recent acquisitions including corporate bank FIH in Denmark and broker and asset manager Singer & Friedlander in Britain, CEO Sigurdsson said last month the bank was ready for more, pointing to the Benelux countries, the Baltic states and northern Germany as natural areas of expansion. Kaupthing said it would issue new shares worth 1.36 billion euros to the sellers. The cash part of the deal, 1.625 billion euros, will be financed by a rights issue of 40 million shares, issuance of Tier 1 hybrid instruments and cash on hand. NIBC also reported its first-half results on Wednesday, reporting a 98 percent decline in net profits to 3 million euros compared with the first six months of 2006. It said subprime losses were largely responsible for the drop. Rating agency Standard & Poor's said after the deal was announced that NIBC's A- long-term counterparty credit rating on remained on CreditWatch with negative implications. Kaupthing made a net profit of 986 million euros last year. (Additional reporting by  Gilbert Kreijger  and  Niclas Mika  in Amsterdam, and  Natalie Harrison  in London)
