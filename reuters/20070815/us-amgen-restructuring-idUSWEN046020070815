 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Amgen Inc. ( AMGN.O ) said on Wednesday it will cut its work force by 12 percent to 14 percent and lowered its 2007 adjusted earnings outlook to a range of $4.13 to $4.23 from $4.28 per share as it grapples with falling sales of its anemia drug Aranesp. 

 The company expects to finish most job cuts by 2008. Amgen expects the cuts to reduce capital expenditures by about $1.9 billion during 2007 and 2008 and said it will book charges totaling $600 million to $700 million during that same period.
