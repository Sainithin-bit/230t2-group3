 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Falling gasoline costs held U.S. consumer prices nearly in check in July and industrial output rose, according to data on Wednesday that suggested the economy was on a sound footing despite financial markets' credit fears. 

 Other reports showed a slight dip in New York state manufacturing activity this month and a decline in the amount of capital flowing into the United States in June. Analysts said the latest data, combined with reports earlier this week showing solid retail sales and a shrinking trade deficit, point to an economy that is performing relatively well. "Things don't look that bad. There is no evidence yet in the data that the economy is on the cusp of losing steam," said Michael Darda, chief economist at MKM Partners in Greenwich, Connecticut. Still, a gauge of home builder sentiment from the National Association of Home Builders hit its lowest ebb since January 1991, suggesting a housing slump still had a ways to run. "Builders realize that issues related to mortgage credit cost and availability have become more acute, filtering some prospective buyers out of the market and prompting others to delay their decision to purchase a new home," said NAHB President Brian Catalde, a home builder from El Segundo, California. The bulk of the data came in close to Wall Street expectations and financial markets focused less on indications of the economy's recent health and more on ongoing worries that credit would evaporate as U.S. subprime mortgage problems widen. The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  ended down 1.29 percent at 12,861.47 -- its first close below 13,000 since April 24 -- while the broader Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  fell 1.39 percent to end at 1,406.70. The S&P, which has dropped more than 9 percent since hitting a record high on July 16, is now trading lower in the year-to-date. Over the past week, central banks around the globe have pumped money into the financial system in an effort to keep credit flowing, but they have had only limited success calming nervous markets. Financial markets now expect the U.S. Federal Reserve to lower interest rates at its next meeting on September 18, if not before, to buffer the economy as credit becomes more scare. Many economists, however, do not expect the central bank to act that quickly. "To me, the risk remains the economy not inflation, but I doubt the Fed will change course before the September 18th meeting without an even more major deterioration in financial conditions," said Joel Naroff, president and chief economist of Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. CONSUMER PRICES UP LESS THAN EXPECTED The Consumer Price Index, a key inflation gauge, rose just 0.1 percent last month as gasoline prices fell 1.7 percent, the Labor Department said. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a rise of 0.2 percent. So-called core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.2 percent, matching forecasts. Year-over-year, the core CPI held steady at 2.2 percent for a third straight month. The Fed said last week that inflation remained its predominant concern, although it acknowledged that a wobbly housing market had led to tightening credit terms for some households and businesses. "The July CPI readings don't make it any harder or easier for the Fed to cut interest rates," said Richard Huber, economist at A.G. Edwards and Sons in St. Louis. "The trade deficit data we got yesterday will drive GDP numbers for the second quarter higher, which will allow the Fed to say that it's still focused on inflation." INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT UP Industrial output rose 0.3 percent in July as automotive-related production surged 2.6 percent, offsetting a big decline in utility output, a Federal Reserve report showed. Manufacturing output rose 0.6 percent. "Low inventory levels, strong export demand, and ongoing moderate economic growth at home have allowed the manufacturing sector to shake off the depressing effects of the housing downturn," said Daniel Meckstroth, chief economist for the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI. Separately, the U.S. Treasury said net overall capital inflows into the United States dropped to $58.8 billion in June from May's revised inflow of $107.3 billion, hurt by a plunge in net purchases of U.S. securities by private investors. June's net overall capital inflow barely covered the U.S. trade deficit for the month of $58.1 billion. In another report, the New York Federal Reserve Bank said manufacturing in New York State factories slowed in August. The New York Fed's "Empire State" general business conditions index fell modestly to 25.06 from 26.46 in July.
