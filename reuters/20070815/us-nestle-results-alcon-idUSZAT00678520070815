 ZURICH  (Reuters) - Nestle ( NESN.VX ), the world's largest food company, said on Wednesday that its stake in U.S.-listed eyecare products company Alcon ALC.N was no longer viewed with the same strategic importance group as previously. 

 "It is also clear that with our transformation to health and wellness and as that transition accelerates, Alcon becomes increasingly a financial rather than strategic holding and we must assess it as such," said Chief Financial Officer Paul Polman in a conference call. Nestle owns a 77.55 percent stake in Alcon, according to Reuters data. Alcon has a market value of $41.3 billion.
