 ZURICH  (Reuters) - Nestle ( NESN.VX ) is expected to use its name-brand pricing power and an efficiency drive to overcome rising input prices and report a 10 percent jump in net profit next week for the first half of 2007. 

 Analysts polled by Reuters expect Nestle, the world's largest food group, to post net profit of 4.56 billion Swiss francs ($3.8 billion) on a 7 percent rise in sales to 50.44 billion francs on August 15 for the first six months. "H1 results should show that Nestle continues to outperform the global food and beverages industry," said analysts at JPMorgan in a note to investors. Nestle and other food processing companies face rising prices for inputs such as milk and grains. But the Swiss-based conglomerate has said it has the name-brand muscle to command higher prices on the store shelves to compensate. The company has said it aims to raise prices, cull unprofitable products and speed up production rationalization to prepare for a lasting rise in commodity and energy prices. Already, rivals Danone ( DANO.PA ) and Numico NUMCc.AS have reported gains in underlying growth, though rising input prices have pressured margins.
