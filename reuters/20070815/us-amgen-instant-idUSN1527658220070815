 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Amgen Inc. ( AMGN.O ) on Wednesday said it plans to cut its work force by up to 14 percent as the biotechnology company copes with lower sales of its anemia drugs. 

 The Thousand Oaks, California-based company has seen revenue from anemia drugs Aranesp and Epogen fall 10 percent in the first half of this year as U.S. regulators put strict safety warnings on the drugs. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services began restricting instances in which they would pay for their use. Amgen said expects the cost cutting moves will be completed by 2008, and result in pre-tax savings from its prior plan of $1 billion to $1.3 billion.  COMMENTS: LES FUNTLEYDER, HEALTHCARE ANALYST, MILLER TABAK, NEW YORK "I think the market will react positively because it's been somewhat expected. If the market reacts negatively, it will be because it isn't enough, but I think it's a recognition on the part of Amgen management that the business has changed. "The fact that they need to restructure is not a positive sign. But to the extent that they understand what the reality is and are dealing with it, is a positive." "As far as I'm concerned, Amgen is a Big Pharma," Funtleyder said. "They have a big infrastructure. They have a reliance on a couple of core products. Their pipeline is so-so. They're a huge company in terms of market cap. And they even may be subject to some generic competition." BILL TANNER, ANALYST, LEERINK SWANN, "MARKET PERFORM" RATING ON AMGEN -- OWNS NO SHARES "I think most people thought something like this was going to occur. The thing that is most interesting is they did talk about making some changes to production and closing certain production operations. That's sort of different than just laying off people and cutting overhead. It suggest that perhaps their expectation for product sales is they are not really going to bounce back... it does certainly suggest that they think that their revenue opportunities -- especially for those drugs -- has probably been permanently impaired". "They can't cost-cut their way to earnings growth and satisfy investors. There is only so much they can actually cut. This might be near-term palliative. There is not much more downside, but worst-case scenario, let's say Roche prevails in the litigation, then there is more downside." ERIC SCHMIDT, ANALYST, COWEN & CO: "There were no surprises. Most of us expected the call to be about cost cutting. The magnitude of the cost cuts is certainly significant, but mostly in line with (Wall) Street expectations. They've given nice guidance for 2007, but didn't give guidance for 2008. Investors will probably ask about that and want to know about 2008. It's probably more impactful than anything they give for 2007. The stock is cheap I and think they'll preserve their cash flow. The measures taken today are appropriate in an effort to preserve the cash flow and it's what the street wants." JOHN MCCAMANT, EDITOR, THE MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY STOCK LETTER: "More often than not, particularly when you get a company of this size, there are places where you can get efficiencies." "They don't have a lot of choices. In the near term, this makes sense." "My ongoing gripe is they acted more like a pharmaceutical company than a biotech for some time" by not innovating. "I don't think they have a choice. They've got to do something to get the Street somewhat interested again. They buy themselves some time. Now they kind of go into a penalty box. Now they have to show me how you are going to go out and deliver the pipeline." (Reporting by  Lewis Krauskopf ,  Nichola Groom ,  Sue Zeidler  and  Kim Dixon )
