 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Boeing Co ( BA.N ), the world's second-largest planemaker, is in talks to buy a plant that makes part of the fuselage of its long-delayed 787 Dreamliner, The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. 

 Citing "a person familiar with the matter," the paper said Boeing wants to buy the South Carolina facility, owned by Vought Aircraft Industries, to gain more control over its supply chain. Neither Boeing nor Dallas-based Vought would confirm the talks. Vought is owned by Carlyle Group CYL.UL. Boeing last week announced a further delay of the first test flight of the carbon-composite 787. The latest delay was the result of a structural flaw, while previous delays have been related to suppliers. Boeing shares were down 17 cents to $42.33 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by Kyle Peterson; editing by John Wallace)
