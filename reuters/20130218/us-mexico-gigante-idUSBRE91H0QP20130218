 MEXICO CITY  (Reuters) - Mexican retailer Grupo Gigante on Monday did not rule out a possible acquisition of the 50 percent stake in U.S. office-supply store chain Office Depot that it does not already own following a report it was in talks to do so. 
 The company ( GIGANTE.MX ) has been considering options related to its 50 percent holding in Office Depot ( ODP.N ) since 2008, Grupo Gigante said. Last week U.S. news agency Bloomberg said it was in talks to buy the other half. Gigante has held talks with various financial institutions "with a view to using credit lines for financial purposes to execute its business plan and that of its subsidiaries," the company said in a statement to Mexico's stock exchange. The business plan does not exclude acquisitions, but it does also include organic growth, the statement said. (Reporting by  Elinor Comlay ; Editing by  Bernard Orr )
