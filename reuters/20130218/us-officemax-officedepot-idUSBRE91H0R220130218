 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - One of OfficeMax Inc's OMX.N top shareholders, Neuberger Berman, said it would support a merger with Office Depot Inc ( ODP.N ) depending on terms of the deal, according to a portfolio manager at the firm. 
 Responding to media reports, Benjamin Nahum of Neuberger Berman, told Reuters in an interview that his preference would be for OfficeMax to declare a special dividend before merging with Office Depot. "In our view this would facilitate a fair deal". Earlier on Monday, the Wall Street Journal reported that OfficeMax and Office Depot were in advanced talks to merge.
