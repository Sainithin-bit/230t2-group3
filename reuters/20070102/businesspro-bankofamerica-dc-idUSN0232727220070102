 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Two senior officials at Bank of 
America Corp.'s ( BAC.N ) corporate and investment bank have left 
as part of a reorganization, a spokeswoman in New York said on 
Tuesday. 

  Chris Innes, global head of equity financial products at 
Bank of America Corp., and Pat Augustine, global head of 
structured products, have left.  Innes had focused on equity derivatives, convertible bonds, 
and prime brokerage. Those groups are merging with the cash 
equities business. Peter Forlenza, previously head of the cash 
equities business, is heading up the combined business.  Augustine had been head of products, including cash 
collateralized debt obligations, synthetic collateralized debt 
obligations, and mortgage-backed securities. Chris Hentemann, 
formerly co-head of global structured finance, will now head 
global structured products.
