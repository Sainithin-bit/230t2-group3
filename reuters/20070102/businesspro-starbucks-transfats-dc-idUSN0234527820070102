 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Pastries and other foods sold at 
half of Starbucks Corp.'s ( SBUX.O ) U.S. outlets will be free of 
artery-clogging trans fats starting this week, a spokesman for 
the coffee shop chain said on Tuesday. 

  The move makes Starbucks the latest in a string of U.S. 
restaurant chains to remove trans fats from its menu. Spokesman 
Brandon Borrman said the foods at all of its U.S. stores would 
be free of trans fats by later this year.  "The plan is that we will complete this year," Borrman 
said, adding that Starbucks has been working on cutting trans 
fats from its products for about two years.  Beginning on Wednesday, everything from muffins to 
sandwiches at Starbucks outlets in Seattle, Portland, San 
Francisco, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Diego, Boston, New York, 
Philadelphia, and Washington D.C. will be free of trans fats, 
Borrman said.  Trans fats are made synthetically when food processors 
harden fat to make it more like butter in a process called 
hydrogenization that is used to extend shelf life and enhance 
the texture of some foods.  Trans fats also increase the risk of heart disease and 
stroke by boosting levels of so-called "bad" cholesterol, known 
as LDL, and reducing levels of "good," or HDL, cholesterol.  Several chains, including Wendy's International Inc. 
WEN.N, Yum Brands Inc. ( YUM.N ) units Taco Bell and KFC, and 
Panera Bread Co. ( PNRA.O ) have either already made the switch 
to healthier oils or have set a timeline for the change.  Last month, New York City banned most artificial trans fats 
from restaurants.
