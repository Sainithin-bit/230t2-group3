 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The spotlight in Apple Computer Inc.'s 
( AAPL.O ) stock options investigation is falling on two former 
company executives, The Wall Street Journal reported on 
Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter. 

  The company has not publicly named the former executives, 
but the Journal said they are former Chief Financial Officer 
Fred Anderson and former general counsel and board secretary 
Nancy Heinen, citing people familiar with the matter.  An Apple spokesman was not immediately available for 
comment.  Apple Chief Executive Steve Jobs received a vote of 
confidence from the company's board on Friday in a 
much-anticipated filing that also said it would take an $84 
million charge for misdating stock options.  A source familiar with the matter told the Journal that 
Apple may argue that Anderson, as CFO, should have been 
responsible for proper accounting of backdated options.  Attorneys for Anderson and Heinen said their clients did 
nothing wrong, the Journal reported.  Anderson's attorney Jerome Roth said that Anderson "did not 
play any day-to-day role in the granting, reporting and 
accounting of stock options and he was not involved in any 
knowing manipulation of the process," the Journal said.  Heinen's attorney Cristina Arguedas said: "We absolutely 
deny that she did anything that could be called intentional 
misconduct," the Journal said.  Anderson is on the board of eBay Inc. ( EBAY.O ), where he 
heads the audit committee, the Journal said. EBay Chief 
Executive Meg Whitman said he would remain in both positions 
despite the allegations, the paper said.
