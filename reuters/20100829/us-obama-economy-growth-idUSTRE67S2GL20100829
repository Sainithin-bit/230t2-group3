 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President Barack Obama said on Sunday there was no magic bullet for what ails the struggling U.S. economy but urged steps such as passage of his small-business lending proposal. 

 "The economy is still growing, but it's not growing as fast as it needs to," Obama said in an interview with NBC News. (Reporting by  Caren Bohan ; editing by Chris Wilson)
