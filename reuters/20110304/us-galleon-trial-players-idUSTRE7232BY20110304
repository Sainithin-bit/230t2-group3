 (Reuters) - The following are some of the main players in the insider trading case against Galleon Group hedge fund founder Raj Rajaratnam, who has vowed to clear his name at trial starting on Tuesday in Manhattan federal court: 

 * Rajaratnam - A stock research analyst who founded Galleon in New York in 1997. He went on to manage about $7 billion at his peak, specializing in technology stocks. The Sri Lankan-born U.S. citizen is 53 and is married with three children. A onetime billionaire, he lives in an exclusive neighborhood on Manhattan's East Side. * John Dowd - Rajaratnam's chief defense attorney. He has had a long career representing noteworthy clients including Major League Baseball, U.S. Senator John McCain and a defendant in the Enron scandal. Dowd, 69, is head of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP's criminal litigation group in Washington. * Judge Richard Holwell - A New York native, known for his calm and polite demeanor in court. He became a judge in 2003 after 32 years as a corporate lawyer at law firm White & Case. He was nominated by President George W. Bush. Holwell made a crucial ruling last November in the Rajaratnam case, denying the fund manager's motion to suppress wiretaps from the trial. * Prosecutors Jonathan Streeter, Reed Brodsky and Andrew Michaelson - Streeter joined the Manhattan U.S. Attorney's office in 2000 and Brodsky in 2004. Both are assistant U.S. attorneys who have handled previous securities fraud cases. Streeter led a case against Marc Dreier, a prominent lawyer who pleaded guilty in 2009 to a $400 million fraud; Brodsky prosecuted hedge fund manager Joseph Contorinis, which resulted in a conviction for insider trading in 2010. Michaelson investigated Galleon while working as a lawyer at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and went on to join the criminal case as a special assistant U.S. attorney. * Roomy Khan - A former Galleon and Intel Corpemployee. She taped conversations with Rajaratnam to help prosecutors bring charges of insider trading. Rajaratnam's lawyers have attacked Khan's credibility because she had a prior conviction for wire fraud in 2001 and they have said she fabricated evidence. * Rajat Gupta - Friend of Rajaratnam and former director of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. The SEC has accused him of tipping Rajaratnam about Warren Buffett's plan to invest $5 billion in the Wall Street bank at the height of the financial crisis. Gupta called the civil charge baseless. Rajaratnam attorney Dowd said the charge, brought a week before his client's trial, "is simply an effort to destroy a favorable witness. * Anil Kumar - Former senior partner at consulting firm McKinsey & Co. Pleaded guilty to sharing secrets about clients and receiving $2 million in payments from his friend Rajaratnam, who has denied the assertion. Could be called to testify, along with former Galleon employees Ali Far, Adam Smith and Michael Cardillo, who have all pleaded guilty. * FBI Special Agent B.J. Kang - Arrested Rajaratnam on October 16, 2009 and oversaw the government's March 2008 application to a federal judge to tap the phones of the hedge fund manager and other suspects. Kang and a colleague, FBI Special Agent David Makol, have also been at the forefront of investigations of so-called expert network firms and consultants who provide company information to hedge funds. The case is USA v Raj Rajaratnam, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 09-01184. (Compiled by Grant McCool, editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
