 (Reuters) - France faced the potential of severe political embarrassment on Friday after carmaker Renault ( RENA.PA ) threw doubt on the spying accusations that shook the company to its core and threatened a diplomatic spat with China. 

 Here is what has happened so far in the espionage scandal which broke at the start of the year: August 2010 - Renault's compliance committee receives an anonymous "ethical alert" triggering an internal investigation. October 2010 - Renault unveils the near street-ready version of its Zoe electric car, due for launch in 2012. Partner Nissan Motor Co ( 7201.T ) shows off its Leaf electric car which it will begin selling in multiple markets a few weeks later. -- Renault prepares to launch the Fluence and Kangoo electric vehicles and the Twizy two-seater electric city car. January 3, 2011 - Renault suspends three executives, including one member of its management committee. It later emerges that the three are Michel Balthazard, senior vice-president of advance engineering, his number two Bertrand Rochette and Matthieu Tenenbaum, deputy head of the electric vehicle program. The company says it plans legal action over alleged leaks of data, prompting a French official to warn of "economic war" and risks to French industry. January 4 - French Industry Minister Eric Besson visits the Renault Technocentre near Paris, the hub of the company's electric vehicle program. January 7 - French intelligence service the DCRI is looking into the case and a possible Chinese connection, a government source says. January 8 - Renault says an international network may have obtained data about the costs and economic model of its electric car program but vital technology secrets -- including 200 patents that are being lodged -- are safe. January 11 - Speaking to journalists outside Renault's headquarters following a meeting with management, Balthazard denies any wrongdoing. -- Tenenbaum's lawyer says his client was accused on the basis of an anonymous letter which said he had received bribes. -- Rochette later tells RTL radio he is "amazed" at the accusations and had nothing to do with leaking information in return for bribes, as Renault alleged. -- China denies any link to industrial espionage, dismissing reports of its possible involvement as "baseless." January 12 - France plays down the possibility of a link to China, saying it is not accusing any one country. January 13 - Renault sets the scene for a lengthy judicial process by lodging a complaint against "persons unknown" on counts of organized theft, aggravated breach of trust and passing intelligence to a foreign power, Paris prosecutor Jean-Claude Marin says. -- Renault says it has discovered serious misconduct detrimental to its "strategic, technological and intellectual assets." January 14 - French state prosecutors launch an inquiry into industrial espionage at Renault. -- France's DCRI has been charged with the investigation. January 19 - The three executives, now fired by Renault, say they plan to take legal action against the French carmaker. January 23 - Chief executive Carlos Ghosn says the suspected espionage appears to have been aimed at uncovering Renault's investment model for its electric vehicles but declines to provide specifics of what proof Renault has of the espionage. March 3 - Renault's lawyer Jean Reinhart tells Europe 1 radio that the authorities were still investigating foreign bank accounts and dismisses media reports that the company had been tricked into believing it had been a victim of industrial espionage. March 3 - Chief Operating Officer Patrick Pelata later tells newspaper Le Figaro in an interview that the company has some reasons for thinking it may have been tricked. March 4 - Renault will "face consequences" after saying it might have been tricked into launching the investigation, says French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde.
