 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - For the first time since the credit crisis 
began last summer, Wall Street does not expect the Federal Reserve to cut 
interest rates at its next meeting, according to a Reuters poll of major 
dealers on Wednesday. 

 However, in a sign of continued fears of recession, the Fed could still 
ease monetary policy after that, and respondents in the survey were split when 
asked whether the U.S. central bank was done cutting rates altogether. The Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark interest rate by a modest quarter 
percentage point to 2 percent on Wednesday and hinted the move could be the 
last in a series dating to mid-September. In announcing the decision, the U.S. central bank pointed to the 
"substantial" reductions it has already put in place and noted that energy and 
other commodity prices were on the rise, a reference to inflation concerns. Since the credit crisis erupted late last year, the Fed has slashed the 
target for the overnight federal funds rate by 3.25 percentage points, and 
investors see the central bank eager to assess the effects of the aggressive 
monetary easing to date. In its statement, the Fed also dropped a reference contained in its last 
interest-rate announcement that "downside risks to growth remain." "They certainly tweaked it a little bit to suggest that they would like to 
at least pause after this meeting, but not especially forcefully so there is 
certainly no promise," said Jim O'Sullivan, economist at UBS in Stamford, 
Connecticut. "In the end it still comes down to the data and the markets." In the survey, 17 out of 19 primary dealers said the Fed would leave 
interest rates unchanged when it meets next, on June 24-25. Two expect a 
quarter-point cut. However, when asked whether the central bank was done cutting, eight said 
yes and 10 said no, reflecting the considerable uncertainty over the prospects 
for U.S. economic growth, which nearly ground to a halt at the start of the 
year. A build-up in inventories kept the U.S. economy afloat in the first quarter 
despite the weakest consumer spending since 2001 and reduced business 
investment, a government report showed on Wednesday. Gross domestic product grew at a 0.6 percent annual rate in the first 
quarter, matching the fourth quarter's advance and topping forecasts for 0.2 
percent growth. However, it did not end a debate on whether the country was sliding into 
recession, even though the Fed expressed concern over inflation and softened 
some of its dour language on the economy. "I still think their No. 1 concern is growth even though it is not clear 
from the statement," said Drew Matus, senior financial economist at Lehman 
Brothers in New York. "I think they signaled a pause, and if I read this in a complete vacuum I 
would say it was probably a neutral policy bias, although I don't think that is 
the actual way of the world." When asked what was the Fed's main concern, 13 said growth, none answered 
inflation and three saw it as balanced between the two factors. Based on the poll, this could lead to additional monetary easing. The 
results of the survey showed four expected a quarter point cut at the Fed's 
August 5 meeting, while 13 forecast no move. Dealers' median forecast for the year-end federal funds rate was 1.75 
percent, indicating one more quarter-percentage-point rate reduction in 2008. In the financial markets, traders were also guessing that the Fed had not 
shut the door to another interest rate cut in June, but most bet that 
Wednesday's quarter-point cut could be the last for a while. Interest rate futures, which measure market sentiment toward Fed policy, 
jumped after the FOMC meeting but still show only a 24 percent chance for a 
June ease.
