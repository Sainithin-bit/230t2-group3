 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Stocks fell on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve trimmed interest rates but left unclear the outlook for further rate cuts, prompting profit-taking as the Standard & Poor's 500 index ended its best month since December 2003. 

 The Fed's failure to deliver an unequivocal statement that the worst was over for the economy caused investors to sell their best performers in the recent rally, led by tech stocks Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ) and Research in Motion RIM.TO RIMM.O. Stocks had risen early in the day after quarterly results from blue chips General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) and Procter & Gamble Co ( PG.N ) topped Wall Street expectations and stronger-than-expected economic data eased recession fears. But the three major indexes shed their gains after the release of the Fed's statement, which left the outlook for further cuts clouded. Short-term rate futures suggested a 1-in-4 chance of a future cut, up from no chance before the end of the Fed meeting. "Everything I heard coming into today was there could be signals of a pause. It's not seeming like that language was in there, so I think that's what people are reacting to," said Eric Kuby, chief investment officer at North Star Investment Management Corp in Chicago." Stocks rebounded this month from a miserable March, as the Fed flooded the financial system with cash in the wake of Bear Stearns' collapse and amid signs frozen credit markets are beginning to thaw. The Dow Jones industrial average finished down 11.81 points, or 0.09 percent, at 12,820.13. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index fell 5.35 points, or 0.38 percent, at 1,385.59. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 13.30 points, or 0.55 percent, at 2,412.80. For the month, the Dow gained 4.5 percent, the S&P rose 4.8 percent and the Nasdaq advanced 5.9 percent. Research in Motion was the biggest weight on the Nasdaq 100, falling 3.7 percent to $121.63. Shares of the BlackBerry maker notched an 8.4 percent advance this month. Apple shares, which surged more than 21 percent in April, fell 0.6 percent to $173.95 and were the No. 3 drag on the Nasdaq on Wednesday. Citigroup Inc ( C.N ) , the largest U.S. bank, weighed on the S&P after it said it sold $4.5 billion of common stock. The offering, which aims to bolster the bank's balance sheet, was larger than expected. Citi shares fell 4 percent to $25.27. General Motors was the top gainer on the Dow after the automaker said overseas sales helped to alleviate weakness in the U.S. market. The company's first-quarter loss was smaller than expected. GM shares rose 9.4 percent to $23.20, its highest level in about eight weeks. F Consumer products maker Procter & Gamble reported profit above expectations, pushing its stock 1.8 percent higher to $67.05.  Starbucks Corp ( SBUX.O ) reported a drop in profit after the closing bell. The coffee chain last week slashed its profit outlook for the year and warned quarterly earnings would miss analysts' estimates, blaming the weakest U.S. economic environment in the company's history. A Commerce Department report on gross domestic product showed the economy growing at a faster-than-forecast 0.6 percent annualized pace, but it was buildup in inventories that kept the U.S. economy afloat in the first quarter. The report showed consumer spending at its weakest since 2001 and a decline in business investment. In another piece of economic data, a survey by ADP Employer Services, seen as a preview to the widely anticipated monthly payrolls report, showed employers unexpectedly added 10,000 jobs in April. A third report showed business activity in the U.S. Midwest in April was slightly stronger-than expected. (Editing by Leslie Adler)
