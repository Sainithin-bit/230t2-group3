 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Time Warner Cable Inc ( TWC.N ), the second-largest U.S. cable operator, reported on Wednesday a higher-than-expected profit for the first quarter, as it added more basic video subscribers. 

 The company, which parent Time Warner Inc ( TWX.N ) plans to spin off completely, said it added 55,000 basic video subscribers in the quarter, compared with the average forecast from eight analysts for a net drop of 21,000 such users. Time Warner Cable said net profit fell to $242 million, or 25 cents per share, from $276 million, or 28 cents per share, a year earlier. After adjusting for special items, profit per share was 24 cents against Wall Street's forecast of 22 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 8 percent to $4.2 billion, compared with the average Street forecast of $4.16 billion. (Reporting by  Yinka Adegoke  and  Tiffany Wu , editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
