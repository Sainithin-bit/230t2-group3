 LONDON/NEW YORK  (Reuters) - British Airways BAY.L said on Wednesday it was in discussions with two of its largest U.S. rivals, American Airlines and Continental Airlines, which a source briefed on the matter said was about a potential alliance. 

 Such a collaboration would create a powerful force in the lucrative trans-Atlantic market, bringing Britain's flag carrier into closer co-operation with American, the world's biggest airline by traffic, and Continental, the U.S. No. 4. "British Airways is exploring opportunities for co-operation with American Airlines and Continental Airlines," the company said in a brief statement, without elaborating. American Airlines, owned by AMR Corp AMR.N, confirmed it was in talks with BA. "AMR is exploring opportunities for cooperation with British Airways," a spokesperson told Reuters. A Continental Airlines spokeswoman declined comment. The source briefed on the matter told Reuters earlier in the week that Continental Airlines Inc CAL.N CAL.N was in "advanced talks" with BA about an alliance, which would help the duo streamline costs while sharing revenues. Continental said on Sunday it would not seek a merger with another airline, calling off talks with UAL Corp's UAUA.O United Airlines, saying instead it would carry on reviewing its alliances with other carriers. American Airlines and BA already have an alliance through the 10-member oneworld alliance, but have twice tried and failed to win antitrust immunity for it. If Continental opted to join with BA and American Airlines, it would likely spell the end of its trans-Atlantic codeshare arrangement with BA's bitter rival Virgin Atlantic VA.UL. Limited immunity from U.S. antitrust laws permits air carriers to coordinate schedules, route planning, and services over international routes. It offers more seamless connections and other benefits that can maximize revenue. Alliances with immunity have been coveted and lucrative, and easier to pull off internally and with regulators than a merger. Regulators have long been concerned that stronger American/BA ties would jeopardize competition at London's Heathrow airport for other U.S. carriers. But air travel restrictions have eased under a U.S./EU "Open Skies" agreement that took effect in March, creating new opportunities for trans-Atlantic air services. Delta Air Lines Inc ( DAL.N ) and Northwest Airlines Corp NWA.N, which struck a merger deal earlier this month, received approval earlier this month from U.S. transportation regulators to broaden their alliance with AirFrance-KLM ( AIRF.PA ), Alitalia AZPIa.MI and other overseas partners. A full merger between BA and one of the U.S. carriers is unlikely, given that U.S. law caps foreign ownership of U.S. airlines at 25 percent of voting stock. European carriers are hoping that the second stage of "Open Skies" will lift those limits by 2010, but U.S. labor groups and politicians are broadly against it. Earlier this year German airline Lufthansa ( LHAG.DE ) bought a 19 percent stake in U.S. discount carrier JetBlue Airways Corp ( JBLU.O ), but no full-scale trans-Atlantic mergers have been attempted. The BA spokesman would not comment on the possibility of a full-blown merger. ABN AMRO analyst Andrew Lobbenberg said that it would not be allowed by regulators. BA Chief Executive Willie Walsh told a conference earlier on Wednesday that restrictions barring the possibility of a merger with a U.S. rival should be lifted. "Airlines may be more sympathetic to consolidation than in other eras (due to the tough climate)," he told the Institute of Directors conference in London.
