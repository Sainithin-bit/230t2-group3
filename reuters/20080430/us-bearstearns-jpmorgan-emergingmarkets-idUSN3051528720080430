 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - No Bear Stearns Cos BSC.N executives will manage emerging markets businesses following its imminent takeover by JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ), according to an internal memo. 

 Global emerging markets head Daniel Pinto, in a memo obtained by Reuters, named 14 regional and business line managers and all currently work for JPMorgan. That's not surprising, since Morgan is a far larger bank with a more extensive presence overseas than Bear. "To capture the value of this combination fully, we must leverage the complementary strengths of our individual businesses, retain and develop our top talent, and build on the momentum both firms have created," Pinto wrote. JPMorgan confirmed the memo was issued on April 24, but declined to comment further. The roster moves differ from decisions made in other areas of the bank, where JPMorgan awarded key jobs to a handful of Bear executives. Two weeks ago, JPMorgan named Bear's Kay Booth as vice chairman of research and added a number of Bear energy trading executives to its commodities ranks. The latest memo made no mention of job cuts, which JPMorgan says will not be announced until the end of next month. The merger is expected to be completed around June 1. Among regional leaders named in the memo, Mike Stewart will head up fixed income in Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa (CEEMEA), while Tarun Mahrotri will run fixed income in emerging Asia markets. Martin Marron and Steve Koenig will co-manage local markets trading and sovereign credit trading in the Americas. JPMorgan also named managers from some specialized businesses. Troy Rohrbaugh will be head of Emerging Markets foreign exchange options, as well as maintaining a broad strategy for forex in emerging and developed markets. James Kenny will be head of Americas corporate credit trading in Latin America, CEEMEA and Asia, while Joyce Chang will serve as head of investments in the Americas and global head of emerging markets research. Outside of trading, Nicolas Aguzin will be head of Latin America origination, responsible for all corporate finance activity across Latin America. Alessandro Barnaba will be head of CEEMEA Sales, marketing and debt capital markets. Two managers with global scope will be Stewart Whitehead, head of Morgan's strategic proprietary business, and Chris Nicholas, head of special situations. JPMorgan also named Bill Perry as manager of emerging markets corporate credit risk, and said Antonio Gil Nievas will be chief financial officer for the global emerging markets business. Moctar Fall will remain vice chairman of emerging markets and has been charged with building an emerging markets infrastructure business. JPMorgan expects to announce more executive assignments in investment banking, trading and back offices in the coming week. (Editing by  Richard Chang )
