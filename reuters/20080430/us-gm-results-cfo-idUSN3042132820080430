 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) forecast a second-half recovery in U.S. auto sales but with less "robust" improvement than the automaker had expected at the start of the year, the company's chief financial officer said on Wednesday. 

 GM CFO Ray Young said the second-quarter was probably going to be "tough" for industry-wide sales in the United States after sales declined some 8 percent in the first quarter. "We still believe there is going to be a second-half recovery, but probably not as robust as what we had thought at the beginning of the year," Young told reporters at GM headquarters. GM cut its forecast for industry-wide auto sales to the mid- to high 15-million vehicle range for 2008 on Wednesday in reporting first quarter results. The automaker had previously expected overall sales above 16 million units. GM forecasts industry sales including both light vehicles and heavier work trucks and buses.
