 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Kellogg Co ( K.N ), the world's largest breakfast cereal maker, on Wednesday, posted higher-than expected profits as price increases helped offset soaring commodity costs. 

 The maker of Frosted Flakes and Keebler cookies also raised its dividend and stood by its full-year earnings forecast, though it said it expects commodity costs to rise more than originally planned. It said first-quarter profit was $315 million, or 81 cents a share, compared with $321 million, or 80 cents a share, a year earlier. The company had an average of 12 million fewer shares outstanding during the 2008 quarter. Analysts on average had forecast 76 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Like most food companies, Kellogg has been hit by soaring costs for wheat and other ingredients and energy. The company has raised prices and looked for ways to cut costs to try to offset rising commodity costs. Sales rose 10 percent to $3.3 billion, helped by price increases and the weaker dollar, which boosts the dollar value of sales overseas. Internal sales, which excludes the effects of currency fluctuations and acquisitions, rose 5 percent. North American internal sales rose 5 percent, with a 4 percent increase in retail cereal sales. Kellogg also said on Wednesday that it would increase its quarterly dividend by 10 percent, beginning in the third quarter. For the year, the company stood by its forecast for earnings in a range of $2.92 a share to $2.97 a share. The company said it now expects commodity, energy, fuel and benefits costs to rise by an amount equal to about 80 cents per share for the year, compared with its prior forecast of 65 cents.
