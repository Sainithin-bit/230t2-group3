 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. securities regulators filed civil 
charges against two former executives at employment listings 
website Monster Worldwide Inc ( MNST.O ) on Wednesday for 
allegedly engaging in fraudulent stock options backdating, 
according to court documents. 

  James Treacy, a former president and chief operating 
officer at the company, and Anthony Bonica, a former 
controller, were accused of benefiting from the fraudulent 
scheme, including the receipt and exercise of backdated option 
grants, according to the complaint.  The complaint was filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan 
by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  (Reporting by  Martha Graybow , editing by Gerald E.
