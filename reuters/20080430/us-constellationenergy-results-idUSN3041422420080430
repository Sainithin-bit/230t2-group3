 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Power company Constellation Energy Group Inc CEG.N on Wednesday posted quarterly earnings that fell well short of Wall Street forecasts on weaker profits from its merchant power arm. 

 First quarter net earnings fell to $145.7 million, or 81 cents per share, from $195.7 million, or $1.07 per share in the same period last year. Excluding one-time items, discontinued operations, the company's adjusted earnings totaled 95 cents per share, 8 percent lower than the $1.03 it earned same period last year and below analysts' average forecast of $1.25 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Constellation's Baltimore Gas and Electric utility posted a 1-cent increase in adjusted earnings per share to 37 cents. But its merchant energy arm, which sells electricity in the non-regulated markets, saw adjusted earnings slide to 58 cents per share from 62 cents a year earlier. Constellation backed its 2008 outlook of $5.25 to $5.75 per share. For 2009, the company expects earnings to rise 15 percent to 20 percent over projected 2008 earnings. Revenue fell to $4.83 billion from $5.11 billion. (Reporting by Christopher Kaufman; Editing by  Derek Caney )
