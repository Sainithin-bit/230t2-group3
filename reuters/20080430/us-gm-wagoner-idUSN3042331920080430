 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) does not expect U.S. auto sales to pick up significantly in the second quarter and remains cautious about the impact of the government's economic stimulus package, Chief Executive Rick Wagoner said on Wednesday. 

 "Obviously, (U.S.) industry sales are a little tougher. We're seeing a mix shift in response to high oil prices so it's created some challenges," Wagoner said on CNBC after GM reported first-quarter results. He said economic stimulus measures have benefited auto sales historically, but the impact of the latest package is in doubt because of the sharp rise in gas prices. "This time we see higher gas prices since the stimulus package was approved, so I think we'll just have to wait and see. Right now I think we have to be rather cautious on the impact it's going to have," Wagoner said. He said the credit markets seem to have loosened up a bit over the last couple of weeks.
