 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - IAC/InterActiveCorp ( IACI.O ) said on Wednesday its quarterly profit fell, but it posted promising growth for the Web advertising and media businesses that it will keep after spinning off four major units. 

 Shares in the Internet conglomerate rose as much as 4 percent after Chief Executive Barry Diller said he aimed to complete the spin-offs in August, with details to be filed with U.S. regulators in May. Diller won a court battle last month against IAC's controlling shareholder Liberty Media Corp ( LINTA.O ) LMDIA.O LCAPA.O, which had tried to oust him over the proposed structure of the spin-offs. On Wednesday, he said IAC was no longer discussing the possibility of an asset swap with Liberty for one of the units, nor did he expect to bring in private equity investors despite discussions with interested firms. "What we're not discussing is the possibility of a so-called swap transaction with Liberty," Diller told analysts on a conference call. "The best thing is to get these companies spun out and to get them into the public markets -- get their managements out there, so to speak." The spin-off units include the HSN cable shopping network, LendingTree online mortgage site, Ticketmaster box office service and Interval time-share exchange. IAC's first-quarter profit fell to $52.8 million, or 18 cents per share, from $60.7 million, or 20 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, earnings for the latest quarter totaled 30 cents per share, just below the average Wall Street forecast of 31 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 8 percent to $1.6 billion. While a Delaware court upheld Diller's authority at the company as chairman and CEO last month, he must still smooth over differences with Liberty and its Chairman John Malone to reach an agreement over details of the spin-offs. IAC directors discussed the spin-offs at a meeting on Monday, and Diller said he expects one or two more board-level discussions on the issue. Malone sits on the board along with one other Liberty representative. GROWTH AT ASK Investors were encouraged by strong growth for IAC's Ask.com search engine, helped by a renewed ad partnership with Google Inc ( GOOG.O ), as well as a more stable showing for LendingTree and revenue growth at HSN. "The Street had been expecting a bad quarter, but in fact it came in better than we expected," said Jeffrey Lindsay of Sanford C. Bernstein. "Management has clearly pulled out all the stops to keep the hopes of the spin-out strategy alive." HSN revenue rose 9 percent, excluding the operations of America's Store that ceased last year, despite a U.S. economic downturn that has hurt retailers generally. LendingTree posted an operating loss of $3.7 million for the quarter, a far better showing than a loss of more than $500 million in the fourth quarter, with a U.S. housing crisis. IAC also highlighted the performance of what it calls "New IAC" -- businesses that will remain with the company after the spin-offs, including online dating service Match.com and Ask. It said New IAC companies posted combined revenue growth of 22 percent in the first quarter to $392 million. The operating loss attributed to New IAC narrowed to $33.3 million from $39.2 million a year before. "It looks like a lot of the promising businesses are in the new IAC," analyst Lindsay said. Investors want to know how IAC will allocate capital across the new entities -- especially whether "New IAC" will be saddled with a higher proportion of debt, he said. IAC executives on the call said it could take more than a month to release details on the capital structure of the spin-offs, and they don't expect to include them in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing planned for May. IAC shares rose 69 cents, or 3.4 percent, to $21.15 after trading as high as $21.29 earlier in the session. Liberty Media's Liberty Entertainment LMDIA.O shares fell 61 cents or 2.3 percent to $25.89. (Editing by  Brian Moss  and  Mark Porter )
