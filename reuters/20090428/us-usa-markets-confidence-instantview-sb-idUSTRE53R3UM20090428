 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence rose in April to its highest this year with some expectations the economic downturn may be reaching a bottom. 

 KEY POINTS: * The Conference Board's sentiment index climbed to 39.2 this month from an upwardly revised 26.9 in March. * The April reading, which was above economists' median expectation for a reading of 29.8, was the highest since November 2008. * The increase in the index was the highest seen since November 2005, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. * The original March reading was 26, which was near an all-time low for the index, which dates back to 1967. COMMENTS: ROBERT CALLAGHAN, MANAGING DIRECTOR, NEWPORT VALUE PARTNERS, NEW YORK: "Consumers' confidence in April belies what I see in the shipping industry; not a lot of goods are moving. Commodities are not showing the rebound in basic demand that would indicate an economic recovery. So this consumer confidence jump may be based on hopes that are not realistic. The Conference Board's index went from 26.9 in March to 39.2 in April. That is beyond startling." JONATHAN BASILE, ECONOMIST, CREDIT SUISSE, NEW YORK: "The panic phase is behind us with the consumers. The outlook is not as bad. It's consistent with some stabilization in consumer spending, which is tentative at best. It's a huge move in expectations. By itself, it's still not a good level. For there to be more improvement, this move has to be confirmed." VASSILI SEREBRIAKOV, CURRENCY STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO, NEW YORK: "It's better than expected, and consumers' expectations rose sharply, more so than their view of the present situation. It's probably driven at least to an extent by a better tone in the equity markets at the time of the survey. It is encouraging that some forward looking indicators are suggesting hints of stabilization. But we are probably still some way away from an economic turnaround. Again, it looks like the dollar-equity correlation is working reliably, and we're seeing equity indices flipping back into the positive territory weighing on the dollar."
