 LONDON  (Reuters) - The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a "public health emergency of international concern" over an outbreak of swine flu in Mexico. 

 International experts will convene on Monday at around 1400 GMT to advise the WHO on whether to raise the current pandemic alert level for swine flu from 3 in its six-step approach. The following are the WHO definitions of the different levels of alert and possible consequences for financial markets at each level in the case of swine flu. LEVEL 2 - animal influenza virus circulating among domesticated or wild animals is known to have caused infection in humans, and is considered a potential pandemic threat. - Financial market impact confined to specific firms or sectors in countries directly affected by outbreak LEVEL 3 - an animal or human-animal influenza reassortant virus has caused sporadic cases or small clusters of disease in people, but has not resulted in human-to-human transmission sufficient to sustain community-level outbreaks. - Market impact limited to short-term swings lasting a few days though further jolts to financial asset prices could be seen if governments or major forecasters cut growth predictions. - Global equity markets suffer moderate setback, with underperformance in particular sectors (transport, travel, leisure, and commodity shares) that are seen most vulnerable to further deterioration in trade flows, travel. - Minor flows into the most liquid bond markets, causing moderate declines in yields in these markets. - Dollar, yen benefit from investors' move into safe havens, with emerging market currencies and higher-yielding ones (such as the Australian and New Zealand dollars) losing ground as investors unwind carry trades put in place in recent weeks as stocks markets have rebounded. - Gold gains LEVEL 4 (current) - characterized by verified human-to-human transmission of an animal or human-animal influenza reassortant virus able to cause community-level outbreaks. - Concern about the impact on global economic activity starts to weigh on the wider equity market. Mark Bon, fund manager at Canada Life in London, estimates an upgrade to level 4 would see stock markets suffer a sudden sharp drop of 7 percent. Relative performance of stock markets could be determined by their economies' exposure to infected countries and by their stock piles of relevant drugs and vaccines. - Further flight to the most liquid bond markets, with curve steepening seen on the cards as investors are expected to favor the front end and cash-like short-term bills. David Keeble, head of fixed income research at Calyon in London, says any WHO upgrade of the alert level could see 10-year Bund and Treasury yields fall about 20-30 basis points within days of such move. - Yen and dollar expected to continue to strengthen, particularly against higher-yielding currencies as above. Any concern about renewed stress in the financial sector will stoke speculation cash could be pulled back to the United States to bolster balance sheets in a rerun of what happened during the financial crisis. LEVEL 5 - characterized by human-to-human spread of the virus into at least two countries in one WHO region. While most countries will not be affected at this stage, the declaration of Phase 5 is a strong signal that a pandemic is imminent. - Further sharp and broad-based drop in equity markets. Canada Life's Bon estimates an escalation to levels 5 and 6 could swiftly knock 15-20 percent off world shares. - Market trading volumes could start to dip, especially if swine flu were to become more widespread in the United States. However, most banks have disaster recovery programs so they can continue trading in other locations. - Stronger move into cash. Shorter end of yield curve also continuing to outperform. Still, expectations that central banks will embark on quantitative easing or pursue such strategies for longer will also push down yields at longer end. -Currency moves begun at level 4 become more pronounced. LEVEL 6 - the pandemic phase, characterized by community level outbreaks in at least one other country in a different WHO region in addition to criteria defined in Level 5. Designation of this phase will indicate a global pandemic is under way. - The World Bank estimated in 2008 that a flu pandemic could cost $3 trillion and result in a nearly 5 percent drop in world gross domestic product. - Sharp falls in market trading volumes and illiquid market conditions, especially in affected regions. - Sharp, broad-based decline in stock market indexes - Flight to cash becomes even more pronounced. Investors demand big premiums to hold all but the most liquid sovereign debt, markets risk seizing up.
