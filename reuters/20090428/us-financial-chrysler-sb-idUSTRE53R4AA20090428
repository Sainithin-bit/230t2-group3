 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A deal has been reached for banks that hold debt of troubled automaker Chrysler Corp. to write down its value, a source familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. 

 "We do have an agreement with the four principal banks in the Chrysler bank group under which they will forgo their ... $6.9 billion of claims against Chrysler in return for $2 billion of cash at closing," the source said. But the source added: "This does not necessarily mean that there will be no bankruptcy." The source, who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity, said there was still a possibility of a "quick surgical bankruptcy" if there was a need to "drag along any recalcitrant banks."
