 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Obama administration said on Tuesday it was not ruling out bankruptcy for Chrysler LLC, despite the U.S. Treasury reaching a tentative deal with banks representing most of the automaker's main lenders. 

 "The developments of the past several days have been important steps to ensure we get a workable deal between Chrysler and Fiat," White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters. "We're pleased at the steps. We don't want to prejudge the outcome. There is still some way to go in the negotiations, so I would not rule anything in or out," Gibbs said.
