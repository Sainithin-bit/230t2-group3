 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc is talking to the U.S. government about its capital levels after receiving the early results of its stress test, but if it needs more capital it does not expect the government to provide it, people familiar with the matter said. 

 The bank may be able to raise any capital it needs by adding more trust preferred shares to the exchange, one person said, speaking anonymously because he was not authorized to speak for attribution. In February, Citigroup said it was exchanging up to $52.5 billion of preferred shares for common shares in an effort to boost a measure of capital strength known as the tangible common equity ratio. As part of that offer, the bank said it would exchange $25 billion of government preferred shares, $12.5 billion of convertible preferred stock, and $14.9 billion of other preferreds. Those other preferreds included straight preferred stock, as well as trust preferreds. The bank said it would like to give priority to exchanging about $14.9 billion of straight preferred shares, but it has also released a list of roughly $15 billion of trust preferred securities that it could exchange, if there were not enough interest on the part of straight preferred shareholders. Investors speculated that those securities would be logical ones to include in any expanded offering. The government gave early results of stress tests to 19 U.S. banks on Friday. Banks can discuss the results with regulators until next week. (Reporting by  Dan Wilchins ; Editing by John Wallace and  Brian Moss )
