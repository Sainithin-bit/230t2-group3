 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Bank of New York Mellon Corp ( BK.N ) CEO Robert Kelly said on Monday that he thinks most U.S. banks are healthier than people may realize and urged the government to let the public know results of its stress test. 

 "I don't know the results for the other banks but I have a suspicion that the average bank is healthier than most people realize," Kelly told a session at the Milken Institute's Global Conference. The government's so-called stress test -- an examination of 19 big banks -- has become a hot-button issue as it is supposed to determine which banks will need more financial help from the government or private sector. Regulators pored over banks' balance sheets to try and identify potential future problems. The banks are expected to receive the final results of the stress tests on Friday, but the information is not expected to be made public until May 4. Even then, Kelly and other bankers said they do not yet know exactly what the government will say about the individual banks examiners have reviewed. "If on average the financial system is in pretty decent shape, let's get that news out," he said. On the other hand he also expects the test to show that some banks will require fresh assistance. "There will be some people that need more capital over time," he said. While Kelly said the public has a right to know many basic things about the stress test and its results, he said that he would be careful about releasing reams and reams of data. "There is a big difference between detail and useful information," he said, warning that very detailed data about individual banks could prompt short-sellers, for example, to pounce and create more market nervousness. The results of the stress test are particularly important, Kelly said, because in some way they are linked to how quickly big banks will be allowed to repay money they received last October when the government handed it out in order to try an stabilize the system as the financial crisis worsened. Bank of New York Mellon, one of the world's biggest trust banks which earns fees for managing investors' money and provides securities services, was among the first banks to receive the government money in October. Many banks are now eager to repay that money to steer clear of government conditions on executive pay and hiring that are linked to it. "Back in October we walked right to edge of what could have been a depression and nine banks originally received government money. I think it has served a purpose," Kelly said, adding however "I want to see this process finished." (Reporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss; Editing Bernard Orr)
