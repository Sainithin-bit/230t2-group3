 DETROIT  (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers union and Chrysler LLC -- 80 percent controlled by private-equity firm Cerberus Capital Management LP -- have reached a tentative concessionary agreement that would help the struggling U.S. automaker cut costs in its bid for survival. 

 Below are some key points for the text of that proposed agreement, which Chrysler's 26,800 UAW-represented workers are expected to vote on by Wednesday night: * In exchange for concessions, the UAW is to get 55 percent stake in Chrysler * Italian car maker Fiat SpA will "eventually" get a 35 percent stake in Chrysler * The U.S. government and Chrysler's secured creditors will split a 10 percent stake between them. * Chrysler will pay a new note to a retiree health care trust with a principal amount of $4.587 billion note * Further annual cash payments under that new note would start at $300 million for 2010 and 2011, then increase to $400 million in 2012 and $600 million in 2013. Annual payments would rise to $650 million for 2014 through 2017, then $823 million for 2019 through 2023. * Fiat would provide "key" engine technology -- such as 3.0 liter diesel and 1.4 liter gasoline engines -- that the UAW said would be "equivalent" to an investment of $8 billion and create 4,000 new UAW jobs. * Under the agreement UAW workers would be paid overtime after working 40 hours a week * The cost-of-living-allowance would be suspended. * Workers would lose of Easter Monday holiday in 2010 and 2011 * Workers would lose their performance bonuses in 2009 and 2010 * Workers would lose their Christmas bonuses in 2009 and 2010.
