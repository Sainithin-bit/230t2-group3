 OTTAWA  (Reuters) - Canada said on Monday the Canadian branches of General Motors Corp and Chrysler LLC were not viable under current plans but it offered C$4 billion ($3.2 billion) in bridge loans to tide them over while they restructure. 

 The Canadian government endorsed plans arrived at jointly with the United States under which Chrysler would have until the end of April to come up with a restructuring plan which has to include a link-up with Italy's Fiat SpA, officials said. GM would have until the end of May to present an acceptable plan of its own, which would have to include more reductions in its legacy costs, related to pensions and other benefits. "We are saying given their current restructuring plans neither company is viable going forward," a senior government official told reporters. No further financing will be provided if acceptable plans are not produced, and the government would have the option of calling the loans. Unlike in the United States, Canada will not be requiring the dismissal of any executives in the Canadian branches, but it will be limiting executive compensation.
