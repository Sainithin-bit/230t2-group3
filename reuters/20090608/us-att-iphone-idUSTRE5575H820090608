 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - AT&T Inc ( T.N ) said it will halve the price of the existing iPhone from Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ) starting on Monday evening and start selling a new version of the phone on June 19 without impacting its profit targets. 

 The exclusive U.S. service provider for iPhone said its costs to sell the newly announced iPhone 3G S would be similar to those for the original 3G iPhone, which pressured its profits last year. But unlike when it announced the first 3G iPhone last year, AT&T said it was sticking by its target for wireless margins in the "low 40 percent range" based on operating income before depreciation and amortization. On June 19 AT&T said it will sell the new iPhone 3G S for $199 for versions with 16 gigabytes of storage space, and $299 for a 32-gigabyte model for customers who commit to a 2-year service plan. The new iPhone 3G S will allow Web surfing at twice the speed of today's iPhone and have a 3 megapixel camera that can record video, according to Apple. AT&T shares fell 10 cents to $24.46 on New York Stock Exchange shortly before the close of trading. (Reporting by  Sinead Carew ; Editing by  Richard Chang )
