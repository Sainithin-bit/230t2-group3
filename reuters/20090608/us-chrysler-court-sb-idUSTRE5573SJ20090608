 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Obama administration urged the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday to reject a request to delay the sale of bankrupt automaker Chrysler LLC to a group led by Italian carmaker Fiat SpA, saying that blocking the deal would have "grave consequences." 

 Solicitor General Elena Kagan of the U.S. Justice Department, the administration's lawyer before the high court, said in a written arguments that the bid by three Indiana pension funds to block the sale could force Chrysler's liquidation. (Reporting by  James Vicini , editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
