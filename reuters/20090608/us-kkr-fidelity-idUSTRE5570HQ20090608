 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Fidelity Investments customers will get access to initial public offerings and other stock offerings by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co KKR.UL companies under a deal expected to be announced on Monday, the Wall Street Journal reported. 

 The agreement would allow the mutual fund firm's retail and institutional brokerage clients to buy into the IPOs, while KKR's capital markets business will get a distribution channel, the Journal reported. The deal would come after KKR, co-founded by "buyout king" Henry Kravis, posted a substantial loss in 2008 as the global economic downturn took a toll on the firm's investments. KKR has not sold shares in an IPO for any of its companies amid the financial crisis, the Journal said. The company also continues to consider buying out its Amsterdam-listed fund, KKR Private Equity Investors LP KKR.AS in a bid to itself go public. A Fidelity spokeswoman did not have an immediate comment on the report. KKR was not immediately available for comment after-hours. (Reporting by  Paritosh Bansal ; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)
