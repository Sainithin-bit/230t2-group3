 BERLIN  (Reuters) - Germany is not forcing any country to seek financial help from a European Union rescue fund, Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said on Monday, denying reports that pressure was mounting on Portugal to do so. 

 "We are not exerting pressure on anyone but we defend the euro," Schaeuble told reporters in Berlin. Earlier, a spokeswoman for his ministry played down the idea EU finance ministers were worried about Portugal. "To our knowledge Portugal is not on the agenda of the finance ministers' meeting (next week)," spokeswoman Jeanette Schwamberger said. "It is up to individual euro zone member states whether they need help from the rescue fund." On Sunday, a senior euro zone source said pressure was growing on Portugal from Germany, France and other euro zone countries to seek financial help from the EU and IMF to stop the bloc's debt crisis from spreading. Greece and Ireland have already taken bailouts during the euro zone debt crisis, and many policy makers hope EU/IMF financing for Portugal would ringfence the crisis.
