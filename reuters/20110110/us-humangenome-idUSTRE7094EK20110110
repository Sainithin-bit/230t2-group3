 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Human Genome Sciences Inc HGSI.O said on Monday it is aiming to achieve "multibillion-dollar" revenue by 2015 as it awaits approval for its experimental lupus treatment Benlysta. 

 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has set an action date of March 10 to decide whether to approve the drug, which would be the first new lupus treatment in half a century. The company said it is well prepared for the launch of Benlysta and expects to receive European approval for the drug in the second half of 2011. Thomas Watkins, the company's chief executive, said in a telephone interview that the company is building a commercial organization in Europe. It will be based in Switzerland. Watkins said he knows that getting European insurers and governments to pay as much for the drug as their U.S. counterparts will be "challenging." "We might have a price in the United States that is higher than in Europe," he said. "All of our commercialization plans are attuned to that possibility." While the company has not said what it plans to charge for the drug, it has pointed to two categories of biologic drugs -- those produced in living cells -- that it considers good benchmarks: rheumatoid arthritis drugs in a class known as TNF inhibitors, such as Amgen Inc's ( AMGN.O ) Enbrel; and multiple sclerosis drugs such as Biogen Idec Inc's ( BIIB.O ) Tysabri. These drugs can range from $20,000 a year to more than $40,000 a year. Mark Schoenebaum, an analyst at ISI Group, said the average estimate from Wall Street analysts for Benlysta sales is $2.05 billion by 2015. Last month, the U.S. FDA delayed a decision on whether to approve Benlysta to review additional data submitted by Human Genome in mid-November. Watkins said he is optimistic the drug will be approved. "We believe the chances for approval are very strong." Human Genome said its current inventory of Benlysta will be enough to meet global market needs for at least one year, and its large-scale manufacturing facility has sufficient capacity to provide worldwide supply for the first two to three years following launch. "Overall, the company's update on their launch and manufacturing capacity plans was in-line with our expectations," said Sanford Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges. Lupus, a debilitating and sometimes fatal disease, causes the immune system to attack the body's own tissues and organs. Human Genome shares rose 1.7 percent to $25.75 in late afternoon trading on Nasdaq. (Reporting by  Toni Clarke ; Additional reporting by Anand Basu; Editing by  Gary Hill )
