 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - There are no discussions currently under way on an European Union/International Monetary Fund bailout of Portugal, the European Commission said on Monday. 

 The Commission was responding to media reports of pressure from Germany, France and other countries on Portugal to ask for EU/IMF financial help after Lisbon's costs of borrowing on the markets have risen sharply. "There is no discussion to this effect, and it is not envisaged at this stage, on such a possibility, be it for Portugal or any other member state," Commission spokesman Amadeu Altafaj told a regular news briefing.
