 VIENNA  (Reuters) - Austria is not pressing fellow euro zone member Portugal to accept a bailout from the European Union and International Monetary Fund, a spokesman for the Austrian finance ministry said on Monday, noting Portugal has not so far had trouble placing government debt. 

 "We are not exerting any pressure. From our perspective this is something for Portugal to decide itself. As long as the decision has not been made there is nothing to comment on. We also see no acute refinancing problems for Portugal," the spokesman said. (Reporting by  Michael Shields ; Editing by Toby Chopra)
