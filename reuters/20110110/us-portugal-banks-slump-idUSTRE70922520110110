 LISBON  (Reuters) - Shares in Portugal's largest listed bank Millennium bcp fell 6 percent in early trade on Monday to record lows, with other banking stocks following on growing market jitters about Portugal's debt. 

 The indebted country's second-biggest listed bank BES fell 3.7 percent to 2.56 euros, its lowest level since September 2001, while third-ranked Banco BPI fell 4.4 percent to 1.257 euros, its lowest level in 16 years. "Expectations of Portugal having to resort to International Monetary Fund help are pressuring the banks more, but the whole of the (Lisbon market) index should also remain under pressure," said Paulo Agostinho, a trader at Fincor. The PSI 20 index was down 1.8 percent at 7,270.33 points by 4:32 a.m. EST. A senior euro zone source said on Sunday pressure was growing on Portugal from Germany and France to seek financial help from the EU and IMF to stop the bloc's debt crisis from spreading. Many policymakers hope EU/IMF financing for Portugal would ringfence the euro zone debt crisis, Greece and Ireland already having taken bailouts. But Lisbon has repeatedly denied it is facing pressure or needs help in recent months. Analysts say that although Portugal's banks are not at the heart of their country's problems as Ireland's are, an excessive dependency on European Central Bank funding and decreasing liquidity due to the government's austerity measures may make the sector an additional cause for concern. The pressure on Lisbon follows a sharp rise in Portuguese 10-year bond yields at the end of last week to euro lifetime highs above 7 percent, as investors worried about the prospect of up to 1.25 billion euros of bond supply it will offer at an auction on Wednesday. The benchmark yield was practically unchanged at 7.27 percent on Monday. (Reporting by Elisabete Tavares and Andrei Khalip; Editing by Greg Mahlich)
