 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ) plans to start disclosing more financial information to investors, including how much of its revenue comes from trading its own money, a person familiar with the matter said on Monday. 

 The change comes after years of complaints from investors, analysts and others that the bank does not disclose enough information about exactly how it makes money. Goldman has prepared a 63-page report after an eight-month internal review, the person said. The results of the review are set to be released publicly on Tuesday, he added. The story was originally reported by the Wall Street Journal. (Reporting by  Dan Wilchins ; Editing by  Bernard Orr )
