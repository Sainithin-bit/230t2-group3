 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Boeing Co. ( BA.N ) said on Thursday it was on track to deliver its new 787 Dreamliner planes next year and tipped a good year for new commercial orders as North American and Asian airlines buy new aircraft. 


 The Chicago-based company, which outsold European rival Airbus ( EAD.PA ) last year, is dominating the lucrative market for wide-body planes, led by the 787. "The 787 is on schedule for its rollout mid-summer (northern hemisphere), with first flight in late summer and delivery in the latter part of H1 of 2008," Randy Baseler, Boeing's Vice President of Marketing, told reporters in Sydney. "We still think it will be a good, solid year, it won't be a record year." Baseler said Boeing was confident it could address issues with the 787's weight, and contingency plans were in place if suppliers did not meet schedules. Boeing has said the launch is on schedule despite teething problems with the plane being overweight and talk that some 787 suppliers were veering off schedule. Investors and customers are closely watching the development of the plane in case it faces delays, as Airbus has with its flagship A380 superjumbo. Boeing has 440 to 445 airplane deliveries this year and estimates 515 to 520 deliveries next year as production ramps up. Baseler said he expected more orders from North American airlines by the end of this year or early next year, as well as from fast-growing Asian carriers. In Europe, British Airways BAY.L has signaled it will announce a major plane order by late summer. Baseler was in Sydney to present Boeing's current market outlook, a 20-year study which tips the global airliner market to buy about 27,200 new planes by 2025. He said consolidation in the airline industry may impact aircraft orders in the short-term orders but was good news for planemakers going forward, arguing more efficient airlines would drive down airfares and increase demand.
