 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. government may look to financial institutions and other investors to help finance the multibillion-dollar modernization of the air traffic system, a senior Bush administration official said on Thursday. 


 "We're looking at a lot of options," Transportation Secretary Mary Peters told reporters after a House of Representatives committee hearing that examined the administration's proposals for air traffic funding. "One option would be if the private sector would be willing to bring the capital forward and build the system and then be paid back through user fees or taxes or whatever way we ultimately decide to fund the system," Peters said. "There may be opportunities to do that," she said of debt and other financing options for modernizing the air traffic infrastructure. Peters said the government would continue to run the network, even if private funds were used to finance part of it. The White House on Monday proposed a new system of user fees and fuel taxes to help pay for Federal Aviation Administration's nearer-term operating expenses, including air traffic services. But the future cost of transforming the radar-based air traffic control network to a satellite system to meet fast- growing demand is guesswork at this point. Officials say it will cost many billions of dollars. "The technology is going to be expensive," Peters said. Boeing Co. ( BA.N ), the biggest aircraft maker, and Lockheed Martin Corp. ( LMT.N ), the largest military contractor, have formed an alliance to bid on contracts for modernizing U.S. air traffic control. The Bush administration has asked Congress for more than $1 billion in the 2008 budget to help lay the groundwork for transforming the system. Congress, however, is more focused on the Transportation Department's plan for meeting the FAA's budget needs over the next several years through proposed user fees for airlines and likely higher fuel taxes for business jets and private pilots. Details of the plan are expected to be released next week. Sen. Sam Brownback urged Peters at a separate Senate hearing to move cautiously on any plan, especially one with substantial fuel tax increases for general aviation users that could wind up hurting manufacturers such as Cessna Aircraft Co., a unit of Textron Inc. ( TXT.N ) Brownback, a Kansas Republican, said significantly higher general aviation taxes could "drive a reduction" in aircraft purchases. "I hope you can understand that these have direct implications," Brownback said. Congress will have to approve the FAA's financing proposal.
