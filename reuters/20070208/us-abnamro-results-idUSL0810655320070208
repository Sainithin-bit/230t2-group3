 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - Dutch bank ABN AMRO AAH.AS posted a 7.6 percent rise in its annual net profit on Thursday, helped by the purchase of Italian bank Antonveneta and the sale of parts of its business, and announced a share buyback. 


 The Netherlands' biggest bank also said it would aim for per share earnings of 2.30 euros in 2007, excluding disposals and restructuring charges. For the current year, analysts have on average been forecasting pre-exceptional earnings of 2.34 euros a share, with individual forecasts ranging between 2.09 euros and 2.74 euros, according to Reuters Estimates. ABN said it will buy back 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion) in shares by the end of June and could consider more in the second half of the year depending on future growth and disposals. ABN AMRO made a net profit in 2006 of 4.715 billion euros, or 2.50 euros per share, compared with 4.38 billion euros, or 2.43 euros per share, a year earlier. Analysts had forecast, on average, a net profit of 4.54 billion euros in a Reuters poll of 25 analysts, with earnings seen at 2.39 euros. Shares in ABN were up 1.3 percent at 25.28 euros by 1050 GMT, outperforming the DJ Stoxx European banking index .SX7P which was down 0.1 percent. The bank said expenses grew faster, by 22 percent, than operating income, which grew 19.6 percent in 2006. The purchase of Antonveneta and an increase in provisions in consumer loans drove costs, which ABN is trying to keep under control. ABN wants to remove at least 900 million euros from its cost base by 2008, and recently announced that it will eliminate 900 jobs in North America. "Costs were a bit higher than foreseen, underlining that ABN AMRO has not made enough progress on the cost side," ING analyst Sigrid Baas said in a client note. ABN managing board chairman Rijkman Groenink told a news conference that cost control would be a top priority in 2007. He anticipated growth in Italy, Asia and Brazil. "I am confident that our cost management will improve significantly in 2007," Groenink said. For the fourth quarter, net income was 1.36 billion euros, up from 1.14 billion euros a year earlier and the 1.23 billion euros average forecast given by 12 analysts in a Reuters poll. MORE DEALS? ABN AMRO, which sold off its Bouwfonds property business, its stake in Hungary's K&H Bank and its futures business, said it would also consider the disposal of non-core assets. ABN AMRO owns 8.6 percent in another Italian bank, Capitalia CPTA.MI, as part of a shareholder pact and is considering a sale of its 40 percent stake in Saudi Hollandi Bank 1040.SE. Spanish bank Santander ( SAN.MC ) recently disclosed that it owns 1.89 percent of Capitalia, and financial and banking sources have said that French investor Vincent Bollore and his allies control 10 percent of Capitalia. That has fueled speculation that Capitalia may become an acquisition target and prompted questions over ABN's position as its biggest shareholder. "We're pleased that Santander is interested in Capitalia." Groenink said, adding that ABN had no intention of selling its stake. "That confirms that Capitalia is a good investment." Asked if ABN were interested in a big acquisition or merger, Chief Financial Officer Hugh Scott-Barrett said that the bank's decision to cut costs and return cash spoke for itself. "That sends a very clear message that the focus is on delivering operating performance," Scott-Barrett told Reuters. ABN shares are up 28 percent since the beginning of 2005, the year that ABN clinched Antonveneta after a prolonged takeover battle and restructured to provide banking services to small- and mid-sized clients globally. But Europe's broader banking market, as measured by the DJ Stoxx European banking index, has risen 50 percent in the same period, fuelling speculation that ABN could be an acquisition target. Groenink has reiterated several times this year that ABN wants to remain independent and control its own destiny. "No takeover premium warranted for ABN's shares, because the high diversity of activities makes the company too unattractive," Rabobank analyst Cor Kluis said in a client note. ABN raised its 2006 dividend by 4.5 percent, to 1.15 euros per share.
