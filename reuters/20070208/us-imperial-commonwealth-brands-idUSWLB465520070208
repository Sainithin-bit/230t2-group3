 LONDON  (Reuters) - Britain's Imperial Tobacco ( IMT.L ) agreed to buy Commonwealth Brands, the fourth-biggest cigarette maker in the United States, but its shares fell on Thursday as speculation faded it might be a bid target itself. 


 Imperial, which makes Lambert & Butler and Richmond cigarettes in Britain, said it would buying CBHC Inc, which trades as Commonwealth Brands, from Houchens Industries Inc. for 974 million pounds ($1.9 billion) in cash. "Through this acquisition we will gain immediate and significant access to the world's most profitable tobacco market and benefit from an enhanced operating platform," Chief Executive Gareth Davis told journalists. Some analysts have said Imperial, the world's fourth-biggest cigarette group, could be a target itself for the world's top two, Altria Group Inc ( MO.N ) and British American Tobacco Plc ( BATS.L ), working with partners to avoid competition concerns. "There would be competition problems left, right and center and Commonwealth Brands would only add to those competition problems," UBS analyst Jonathan Leinster said. Shares in Imperial, which have outperformed the UK tobacco sector by 3.5 percent over the last 12 months, were down 2.6 percent at 21.73 pounds by 1545 GMT, valuing the group at around 16 billion pounds. It was the top loser on the FTSE 100 index  .FTSE , as the market factored in the diminished likelihood of a bid from Altria's Marlboro-maker Philip Morris or BAT. Imperial was also reported to be considering a 10.2 billion plus euro ($13 billion) bid for Franco-Spanish tobacco group Altadis ALT.MC ALDS.PA as the cigarette market consolidates, but Davis appeared to rule out a bid in the near future. "Our focus is very much on this deal ... we will be concentrating all our attentions on making sure it is a whopping success for us. But I would say our strategy remains unchanged -- we will grow shareholder value by organic and acquisition growth," Davis said. Altadis shares fell 1.6 percent to 39.90 euros. Its shares have been boosted by talk of an Imperial bid especially after world No 3 Japan Tobacco ( 2914.T ) bid 7.5 billion pounds to buy Imperial's British rival Gallaher Group Plc GLH.L in December. "This was not the deal we sense the market was expecting, and as such we would not be surprised if Imperial is weak in response to this announcement," analysts at Morgan Stanley said. Davis had indicated in October Imperial planned to enter the U.S. tobacco market, the world's second biggest after China, to distribute products such as Davidoff as the litigation risks in the United States had substantially decreased. Bowling Green, Kentucky-based CBHC, which sells 3.7 percent of the 376 billion cigarettes smoked annually in the United States, is the nation's fourth-biggest player after Altria, Reynolds American Inc ( RAI.N ) -- 42-percent BAT owned -- and Loews Corp's LTR.N Lorillard Tobacco unit. CBHC, whose key brands are USA Gold and Sonoma, sells five brands across the United States and Puerto Rico, with total sales in the year to the end of September of 14 billion cigarettes. Imperial expects to complete the debt-financed deal by April which would allow it to boost earnings in the current financial year, before taking account of brand amortization and deferred tax on intangibles. "This is a good deal, it is financially attractive and was a market Imperial was planning to enter organically so there will be good revenue synergies," said Jonathan Fell at Deutsche Bank. Imperial said its share buyback program would be temporarily suspended as a result of the acquisition. "Sometime toward the end of next year I'm sure credit metrics will be back where they are today before this deal. We will resume (buyback) at an appropriate time," Finance Director Bob Dyrbus said. Both Fitch Ratings and Standard & Poor's left their ratings unchanged at BBB following news of the acquisition. Imperial said the risk of U.S. litigation against CBHC, which has not been named in any class action lawsuits, was minimal as the group's products were relatively new and had complied with Master Settlement Agreement restrictions.
