 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Warner Music Group Corp. WMG.N on Thursday posted a 74 percent drop in its quarterly profit and fell short of Wall Street expectations on a weaker album release schedule than a year before. 


 A generally tough environment for music sales also contributed to the shortfall, as a growing number of consumers are downloading more music over the Internet, with such services as Apple Inc.'s ( AAPL.O ) iTunes, rather than buying physical albums. Music companies have raced to boost digital sales as a percentage of overall revenue, but digital remains a relatively small piece of the pie. The world's fourth-largest music company said profit for the fiscal first quarter ended December 31 fell to $18 million, or 12 cents per share, down from $69 million, or 46 cents per share the year before. Revenue fell 11 percent to $928 million. Results missed the average of Wall Street analysts' forecasts for earnings per share of 24 cents and revenue of $943.9 million, according to Reuters Estimates. Albums by artists including My Chemical Romance and Josh Groban sold worse than hit albums a year earlier by such artists as Madonna, James Blunt, Enya and Green Day. Recorded music sales fell 13 percent to $800 million, dragged by the United States and Europe and dampening stronger sales in Asia Pacific. Warner said digital music sales continued to increase their share of total revenue to 11 percent, or $100 million. In Warner's U.S. recorded music business, digital music sales amounted to $61 million, or 17 percent of its domestic business. The company said iTunes remains the major outlet for U.S. consumers while mobile phone partnerships delivered more digital sales internationally. The company said it expects a better second half of the year based on its release schedule and remains "confident" of its fiscal 2007.
