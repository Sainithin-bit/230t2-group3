 LONDON  (Reuters) - Britain's BT Group Plc ( BT.L ) posted third-quarter core earnings in line with forecasts on Thursday and issued a strong outlook amid a better-than-expected broadband performance, helping its shares touch five-year highs. 


 "After 19 consecutive quarters of earnings per share growth, our expectations are to continue to grow our revenue, EBITDA, earnings per share and dividends for this financial year and next," Chief Executive Ben Verwaayen said in a statement. The UK's largest fixed-line company also said it would receive about 1 billion pounds ($2 billion) in cash in the form of tax refunds in the fourth quarter and next fiscal year's first half following a settlement with the UK's tax authorities. BT's shares rose nearly 4 percent to 328-3/4p by 1037 GMT, having touched a 329-3/4p peak -- their highest level since September 2001 -- as the quarterly figures showed that former monopoly's traditional calls business had improved while strength at its new businesses was maintained. "The key performance indicators of this business, which will determine where this business will go in the future, are moving distinctly more positively in every single area," said Dresdner Kleinwort analyst Lawrence Sugarman. BT posted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), before one-off items and staff leaving costs, of 1.44 billion pounds for the three months to December 31, compared with 1.40 billion a year ago. Revenue rose 5 percent to 5.13 billion pounds, ahead of forecasts, helped by a 17 percent rise in so-called new wave revenues from broadband Internet and corporate networked IT services -- areas BT is increasingly reliant upon to counter a decline in its fixed-line business. Analysts had on average forecast EBITDA of 1.44 billion, with estimates ranging between 1.43 billion and 1.45 billion pounds. Revenue forecasts ranged between 5.01 billion and 5.06 billion pounds. BROADBAND SHINES BT's retail unit's share of net broadband additions rose to 34 percent during the quarter -- the highest for over two years -- from 25 percent during the preceding three-month period. Broadband is a key plank in BT's future plans as services ranging from mobile to television depend on it, making it important for the company to have a high market share in this area given the challenges facing its fixed-line business. BT's retail unit's share of net wholesale DSL (digital subscriber line) broadband additions had been steadily falling for the past several quarters, and analysts had expected this trend to worsen during the quarter and through 2007. This follows the launch of cut-price offers by rivals such as Carphone Warehouse Plc ( CPW.L ) and BSkyB ( BSY.L ) that could trigger customer defections from BT's generally pricier broadband offerings. "There is a market for price, but there is a big market for value," said CEO Verwaayen. BT said revenue from the group's traditional businesses fell by 1 percent, an improvement on recent trends, and its 12-month rolling average revenue per consumer household (ARPU) rose by 4 pounds in the quarter to 258 pounds. "The rate of decline in the traditional business is significantly lower than last quarter, and for the first quarter in four years, the number of active consumer voice customers has grown," BT said. BT said its retail unit showed a revenue growth of 1 percent, its first quarter of positive growth in nearly 4 years. Shares in the group, already up 5 percent this year after rising 18 percent through 2006, were 3.63 percent up at 328 pence by 1020 GMT on Wednesday. The shares trade at around 14 times forecast earnings, compared with multiples of around 14 and 12 for rivals Vodafone ( VOD.L ) and France Telecom FTE.PA respectively.
