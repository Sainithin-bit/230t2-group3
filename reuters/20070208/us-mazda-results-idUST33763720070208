 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Mazda Motor Corp. posted a 7.5 percent rise in quarterly profit on Thursday, powered by the yen's slide and increased exports to North America and Europe, and tweaked its annual forecasts to account for a softer yen and slower growth in vehicle sales. 


 The Hiroshima-based carmaker, held one-third by Ford Motor Co., is enjoying brisk sales of Japan-made cars such as the Mazda5 minivan and CX-7 crossover in Western markets, getting a double boon as the weaker yen jacks up the value of earnings made abroad. Like most of its domestic competitors, Mazda boosted its vehicle exports from Japan by double-digit percentages in 2006 from the year before, making up for a sales slide at home and other markets, mainly Australia. Last year, Mazda exported about three-quarters of the vehicles it built in Japan. Thanks to a favorable slide in the Japanese currency, Mazda now expects operating profit to come to 158 billion yen ($1.31 billion) in the business year to March 31 instead of 148 billion yen, now calling for a 28 percent jump from last year's record. Based on a new assumption that the dollar would average 116 yen and the euro 148 yen during the year, Mazda expects currency gains to add 36.1 billion yen to operating profit -- about 20 billion yen more than it anticipated three months ago. It had assumed a dollar rate of 113 yen and the euro at 143 yen in November. But Mazda said it had already hedged against currency swings for the business term, meaning the windfall would not appear at the net level. Instead, fewer-than-expected vehicle shipments and higher-than-anticipated warranty and other costs to launch new models would subtract around 9 billion yen, Mazda said, lowering its net profit forecast by that amount to 73 billion yen. "If you had to choose between positive and negative, the news would be on the negative side," Deutsche Securities auto analyst Tsuyoshi Mochimaru said. "But there's no need to over-react, since I don't think the shortfall (below the operating level) would be as big as the company expects," he added, pointing to the relatively small downward revision of its vehicle shipments. Mazda now expects to ship 1.17 million units globally, or 10,000 units less than projected in November. Half of the shortfall would occur in Japan and the rest mostly in Australia. For the three months to December 31, operating profit was 37.5 billion yen, short of a mean estimate of 39.27 billion yen produced in a survey of five brokerages by Reuters Estimates. Third-quarter net profit grew 46 percent to 14.9 billion yen, while revenue rose 3.6 percent to 768.14 billion yen. EYES ON MID-TERM PLAN With earnings landing largely within expectations, all eyes will be on Mazda's new mid-term business plan to be announced next month. The plan is expected to contain a blueprint for expanding Mazda's production capacity, now at around 1.45 million units globally. Analysts say Mazda needs to build more vehicles outside Japan to shield itself against adverse currency swings, and some speculate it could utilize Ford's excess capacity in North America to help both companies save money. Keishi Egawa, managing executive officer in charge of corporate planning and financial services at Mazda, declined to provide any details of the upcoming plan, but said the heavy dependence on exports could be a liability down the line. "You could look at the high export ratio as a favorable factor given the yen's weakness, but in a longer-term view, we think it's best to think of it as a risk," he told a news conference. During the three months to the end of December, Mazda's shares gained 13.5 percent to 813 yen, lagging Tokyo's transport sector subindex ITEQP, which rose 17.4 percent. Before the announcement, the shares ended Thursday trade down 0.8 percent at 772 yen. ($1=120.82 Yen)
