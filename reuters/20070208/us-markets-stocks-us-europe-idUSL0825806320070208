 LONDON  (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures indicated a lower opening on Wall Street on Thursday with the focus on corporate results, while European shares slipped after a slew of mixed earnings. 


 Shares of storage systems company EMC Corp. ( EMC.N ) will be watched after they rallied 7 percent after the close of regular trading hours on news it plans to sell a 10 percent stake of its VMware unit in an initial public offering. Tobacco stocks are also in the limelight as Britain's Imperial Tobacco ( IMT.L ) agreed to buy Commonwealth Brands, the fourth-biggest cigarette maker in the United States. By 1120 GMT, Dow futures DJc1 were flat, Nasdaq futures NDc1 had slipped 0.2 percent and S&P futures SPc1 had eased 0.1 percent. Earnings from S&P 500 companies have mostly come in ahead of market estimates but a run-up in the market in recent weeks meant that investors were already discounting robust results, traders said. Aon Corp AOC.N, Aetna ( AET.N ) and Pepsico ( PEP.N ) are among the U.S. companies reporting results on Thursday. Banks might also be in focus after shares in Europe's biggest bank HSBC ( HSBA.L ) fell 2.5 percent after the company warned of a shock increase in bad debt charges. US. technology stocks rose on Wednesday as Cisco Systems' ( CSCO.O ) profit and outlook reinforced optimism over earnings, while the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  ended flat at 12,666.9. Among gainers, shares of The Walt Disney Co. ( DIS.N ) rose nearly 2 percent after the company reported quarterly earnings that beat analysts' expectations. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  gained 0.8 percent, to close at 2,490.5.
