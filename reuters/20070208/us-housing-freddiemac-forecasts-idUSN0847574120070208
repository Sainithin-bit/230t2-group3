 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Housing activity has slowed from recent years but the dragdown should not lead to a recession, mortgage finance company Freddie Mac FRE.N said on Thursday in its monthly economic outlook. 


 "Any risks the housing contraction could spark an economy-wide recession are fading fast. After subtracting 1.2 percentage points from GDP growth in the third and fourth quarters of 2006, the drag from further declines in construction spending should peter out toward mid year," it said. Freddie Mac said inventories of new homes are higher than reported due to cancellations of sales contracts. Inventory buildup is also understated due to homeowner vacancies of condos, it said. "Housing activity is stabilizing at levels well below recent years," it said. The gap between supply and demand may not be sufficiently narrowed until late 2007 as home prices will likely remain on the higher end, the housing finance giant said. "Sellers are gradually and reluctantly lowering their asking prices in response to the new reality of a buyers' market," it said. Freddie Mac said it expects 30-year mortgage rates to rise to 6.4 percent by the end of 2007 and to be slightly higher in 2008. It also forecast 2007 housing starts would be 10 percent below last year's, at 1.62 million units. Total 2007 sales of new and existing homes will total 6.3 million units, and 6.4 million next year, it said. Home prices should fall 3.3 percent in 2007, it said. Freddie Mac is a mortgage finance company chartered by Congress that buys mortgages from lenders and packages them into securities to sell to investors or to hold in its own portfolio.
