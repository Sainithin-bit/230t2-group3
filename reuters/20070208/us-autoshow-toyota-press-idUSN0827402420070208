 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp.'s ( 7203.T ) North American chief said on Thursday that the product recalls the automaker suffered in recent years had shaken the company and that it was now determined to widen the margin by which its cars outperform U.S. rivals in industry performance surveys. 


 Speaking at the Chicago Auto Show, Jim Press, the president of Toyota Motor North America, disputed the notion that Japanese cars' once considerable lead in reliability and quality over American cars was a thing of the past. "I think there's some hope that the gap in quality is closing," Press said. "But it really isn't." He said that recalls of Toyota cars and trucks, which spiked between 2003 to 2005, had "scared us to the point where we're re-energized on quality and you're going to see continuing bigger efforts to actually make the margin and the gap bigger." Press, who has repeatedly expressed optimism about the outlook for the Detroit automakers, wasn't entirely disparaging about the U.S. auto industry when he talked about their products on Thursday. Recalling last month's Detroit Auto Show, Press said GM's unveiling of its new mid-size sedan had been one of the standouts of the event. "What was the car of the show?" he said. "For me, it was the (Chevrolet) Malibu."
