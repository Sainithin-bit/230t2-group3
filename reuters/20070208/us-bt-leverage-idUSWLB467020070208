 LONDON  (Reuters) - British telecoms company BT Group Plc ( BT.L ) said on Thursday it was willing to consider all options to cut the cost of its debt, including looking to raise debt at the level of its Openreach division. 


 "From my perspective, all options are things we would consider and look at," Finance Director Hanif Lalani told reporters. Analysts have suggested that BT could raise debt through its Openreach division, which, with its utility-type cash flows, could lower the group's overall cost of borrowing. Lalani said BT's board regularly reviewed the capital structure of the group. "Underneath that, it is great to have options. And some of the options are: does Openreach extend the debt capacity? Does it provide cheaper debt, and really I owe it to shareholders to look at all options available."
