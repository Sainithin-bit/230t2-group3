 SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - Singapore Telecommunications Ltd. 
( STEL.SI ), Southeast Asia's largest phone firm, said on 
Thursday it was unsure if Vodafone plc's ( VOD.L ) stake in 
India's Bharti ( BRTI.BO ) was up for sale and that it was 
premature to comment on possible talks. "It is our objective to 
increase our stakes in existing associates at the right terms 
and conditions, and Bharti is certainly one associate we are 
interested to increase our shareholding in," Chief Financial 
Officer Chua Sock Koong told a media briefing. 


  "Whether Vodafone's stake is open for sale is still very 
unclear. It is really premature for us to comment on any 
discussions (with Vodafone) at this stage."
