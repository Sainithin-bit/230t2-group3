 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Tribune Co. TRB.N reported a better-than-expected rise in quarterly profit on Thursday helped by an extra week in the quarter that boosted advertising revenue at the company's newspapers. 


 The results come as Tribune considers several offers to split up its newspaper and broadcast divisions, or to go private. Tribune, which owns the Los Angeles Times, a group of television stations and the Chicago Cubs baseball team, did not make any comments on the process. It said net income rose to $239.1 million, or 99 cents a share, compared with $132.3 million, or 43 cents a share, in the fourth quarter a year ago. Income from continuing operations was 96 cents a share, compared with 42 cents last year. The company recorded a gain on several investments and asset sales, but took charges for cutting about 400 jobs and shutting its Los Angeles Times San Fernando Valley printing facility. Excluding some special items but including a gain related to changes in its pension plan, profit was 68 cents a share, beating the analyst consensus of 61 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose more than 5 percent to $1.47 billion, above the consensus analyst forecast of $1.43 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Tribune's newspaper performance reflects that of other U.S. publishers who are trying to increase circulation in their print product even as more people leave them behind in favor of the Internet. Operating revenue in the publishing group rose 4 percent to $1.1 billion, while expenses held steady at $840 million. Ad revenue rose 4 percent, but would have fallen 3 percent without the extra week during the quarter. Online revenue in the publishing division reflects that shift, as quarterly revenue rose 31 percent on the strength of classified ads. Tribune is expected to hold meetings next week to consider offers for the company. One bid was mounted by its largest shareholder, the Chandler Trusts, which in June urged the company to break itself up or consider a sale. A rival bid by Los Angeles billionaires Eli Broad and Ron Burkle consists of a leveraged recapitalization, while private equity firm Carlyle Group wants to take over Tribune's television station assets, sources have told Reuters. Real estate magnate Sam Zell, founder of Equity Office Properties EOP.N, also has approached the company with a proposal to take an equity stake, the Chicago Tribune reported on Wednesday.
