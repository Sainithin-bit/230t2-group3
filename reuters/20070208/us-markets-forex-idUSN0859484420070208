 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The euro advanced against most currencies on Thursday after investors interpreted remarks from the head of the European Central Bank as signaling a rise in benchmark interest rates in March. 


 But the dollar did strengthen against the yen ahead of a meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Seven wealthiest nations, after earlier speculation that the yen's weakness might be a focus of the meeting had fueled a mild rally in the Japanese currency. The focus of the day's trading was the euro after the ECB left rates unchanged at 3.5 percent as expected, but ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet repeated the phrase "strong vigilance" to describe how the bank will monitor euro zone inflation. "Strong vigilance remains of the essence so as to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialize," ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet told a news conference. The ECB has used the word "vigilance" in its statements every month before the six rate increases delivered since December 2005. Asked if the markets should understand the phrase to mean a rate rise in March, Trichet said: "It speaks for itself." "Trichet managed to voice his very hawkish stance," said Greg Salvaggio, vice president of trading at Tempus Consulting in Washington D.C. "When he said 'strong vigilance,' I'm not quite sure what more he could use to signal that they will hike next month." Against the dollar, the euro was up 0.1 percent at  $1.3035. The yen again traded lower across the board. The dollar rose 0.3 percent to 121.05 yen while euro/yen was up 0.5 percent at 157.84 yen. Michael Woolfolk, senior currency strategist at The Bank of New York, said the ECB president's statements "confirmed market expectations of a 25 basis-point rate rise at the upcoming March meeting and reinforced expectations of a further rate rise later this spring." They also "created expectations of additional ECB rate hikes during the second half of the year even after the removal of monetary accommodation was completed," Woolfolk added. In an accommodative monetary policy, euro zone interest rates have been relatively low, but the ECB has been working to combat inflation by gradually raising rates. The euro strengthened against sterling to 0.6658, up 0.8 percent on the day. Against the Swiss franc, it rose 0.6 percent to 1.6246 francs. Meanwhile, other traders cited pressure on the British currency against the dollar, after the Bank of England held benchmark rates steady at 5.25 percent early Thursday. This limited the euro's gains against the greenback, they said. Sterling fell after the decision as there were some expectations for a rate rise following the bank's surprise increase in January. The pound traded down 0.6 percent on the day against the dollar at $1.9576. With the ECB decision out of the way, markets are now looking ahead to a meeting of Group of Seven finance officials in Essen, Germany on Friday and Saturday. European officials have been calling for discussions on the weak yen at the G7 meeting. But Tokyo and Washington have been playing down the issue, leading to speculation the G7 was unlikely to take a tough stance on the Japanese currency.
