 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) on Thursday forecast a 1 percent to 2 percent rise in February sales at its U.S. stores open at least a year, continuing its run of tepid sales gains. 


 The world's biggest retailer provided the estimate after confirming its January U.S. same-store sales rose 2.2 percent. It had forecast a 1 percent to 2 percent gain. Total sales for the five-week period ended February 2 rose 10.7 percent to $31.69 billion. Wal-Mart is working to boost sales at its U.S. stores, which it says have been hurt by store remodeling projects, which disrupted shoppers, and an effort to sell trendy merchandise, which met with mixed results. Same-store sales at its U.S. stores rose 1.6 percent in December and declined 0.1 percent in November. In its fourth quarter, which included the January five-week reporting period, sales were strong in entertainment, grocery and pharmacy, Wal-Mart said. Overall sales in apparel and home items were soft, but men's apparel had above-average same-store sales for the January, it said. "Colder temperatures throughout the United States drove sales of cold weather-related items," Eduardo Castro-Wright, Wal-Mart U.S. president and chief executive, said in a statement.
