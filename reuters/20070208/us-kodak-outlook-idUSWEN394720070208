 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Eastman Kodak Co. EK.N said on Thursday it expected to cut up to 3,000 additional jobs and complete a three-year restructuring program by the end of 2007 that it says will help sustain profitability. 


 Kodak said at its investors day in New York that it aimed for gross profit margins of 28 percent to 29 percent by 2009, with earnings from operations at 8 percent to 9 percent of revenue. Profits will be fueled by expected gains in its digital products markets -- including cameras, consumer and commercial printing -- as well as with technology licensing and shrinking costs, the company said. The camera and photography company expects to make restructuring payments of $575 million to $625 million in 2007, raising the total cost of an overhaul first announced in January 2004 to a range of $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion. Its previous estimate for restructuring costs was $3 billion to $3.4 billion. Chief Executive Antonio Perez said that 2007 will be the last year of the transformation, with an end in sight for the huge restructuring costs that have been a constant over his 20-month tenure as CEO. "I want this (spending) to stop this year. It will stop this year," he said at the meeting. "I want that $500 million in our bank in 2008." Kodak also expects total job cuts of 28,000 to 30,000 compared with a previous estimate of 25,000 to 27,000 issued in August. As of the fourth quarter, Kodak had eliminated 23,400 jobs under the plan. Kodak is making a tough and expensive shift away from its traditional film market, where sales are declining, to digital products and services. Kodak said on Thursday it expected digital earnings from operations of $200 million to $300 million in 2007 on digital revenue growth of 3 percent to 5 percent. The company introduced earlier this week a long-awaited line of inkjet printers and low-cost replacement ink cartridges. Last month it agreed to sell its medical imaging group, its second most profitable unit, to refine its business focus. Wall Street analysts, many of them rating Kodak at the equivalent of "hold" or "sell", have questioned whether licensing revenue, a late entry into the inkjet market and cost cuts will yield the company's sought-after results. Fueled by patent license revenue, the company said last week that it turned a small profit in the 2006 fourth quarter. Its net loss for the full year was $754 million, significantly narrower than its loss of $1.35 billion in 2005. Analysts have found it difficult to measure Kodak's overall health due to the constant restructuring over the past three years. While some units have grown and added workers, others are cutting operations and jobs. Those shifts continued in January, when Kodak said it will sell its medical imaging business to a unit of Canada's Onex Corp. ( OCX.TO ) for up to $2.55 billion. The unit makes X-ray film, medical printers and information systems. Shares of Kodak fell 60 cents to $26.09 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday. (Additional reporting by  Michele Gershberg )
