 CALGARY, Alberta  (Reuters) - Canadian oil production will 
grow 9 percent this year, the country's national energy 
regulator said on Thursday, due to growing output from the 
Alberta oil sands and offshore oil projects. 


  In its 2007 production estimate, posted on its Web site, 
the National Energy Board said Canadian oil output should climb 
to about 2.89 million barrels a day, 9.1 percent more than the 
2.61 million barrel a day average in 2006.  The board said the biggest gains are expected in the 
production of synthetic and heavy oils from the oil sands of 
Northern Alberta.  Synthetic crude output from oil sands upgraders owned by 
Suncor Energy Inc. ( SU.TO ), Shell Canada Ltd. SHC.TO and 
others should rise to more than 716,000 barrels a day this year 
from about 646,500.  Production of tar-like heavy oil from oil sands and other 
reserves, will climb to 1.08 million barrels a day from 
987,750.  Daily production from oil projects off Canada's East Coast 
is expected to climb 29 percent to about 392,800 barrels. 
Output from the region was hampered in 2006 when Petro-Canada 
PCA.TO temporarily suspended operations at its Terra Nova 
field to fix mechanical problems.
