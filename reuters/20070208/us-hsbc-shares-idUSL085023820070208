 LONDON/HONG KONG  (Reuters) - HSBC's shares slumped to a 9-month low on Thursday after Europe's biggest bank announced its bad debt charge last year would be about $1.8 billion higher than expected as problems grew in its U.S. mortgage lending. 


 Europe's biggest bank said its 2006 charge for bad debts would be about $10.6 billion -- or 20 percent above analyst consensus forecasts -- as problems deepened in its mortgage lending to lower quality U.S. borrowers. The statement was issued late on Wednesday after the bank held a board meeting. By 0945 GMT its London-listed shares were down 2.4 percent at 909 pence, after sinking as low as 907-1/2p, their lowest since May and valuing the bank at 106 billion pounds ($208.9 billion). Its Hong Kong-listed shares closed down 2 percent to HK$140.70. HSBC said there were accelerating delinquency trends across its U.S. sub-prime mortgage market, particularly for more recent loans. "The disturbing fact is that it's recent loans, it's not something that's gone wobbly over time. It's stuff that they've acquired that has gone spectacularly wrong in a short space of time," said Mike Trippitt, analyst at Oriel Securities in London. He said the key issue was whether all the bad news was now out or if the delinquencies could spread. Problems in the U.S. housing market have hit several lenders, but HSBC has warned that conditions have deteriorated three times in as many months, highlighting that its credit scoring system is flawed, analysts said. BIGGEST PURCHASE Criticism is mounting of HSBC's purchase of Household International for $14.8 billion in 2003, which was its biggest ever acquisition. The business is now part of HSBC Finance. "It (Household) is a deal that has been earnings accretive, so financially it's been a reasonable deal, but it's clearly changed the shape of group earnings and made them more volatile, hence the sustained de-rating of the group. So it's not necessarily been a good strategic deal," said Ian Gordon, analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort. The bank's North American operations, which include HSBC Finance, last year generated 31 percent of total profit, but 65 percent of bad loans. Gordon said the latest warning meant HSBC's bad debt pain will be much worse in 2006, but should stabilize in the next two years so the trajectory of earnings growth should improve. He estimated North American bad debts will come in at $7 billion for 2006, or 67 percent of the group total. He expects impairments to rise to $7.6 billion in North America next year, or 65 percent of a group level of $11.8 billion. HSBC's announcement triggered a ratings downgrade by JPMorgan, while Merrill Lynch dropped its earnings forecast ahead of the global bank's expected March 5 results. JPMorgan, Dresdner and several other analysts said they would cut their 2006 earnings forecasts by 5-8 percent. Analysts had expected 2006 pretax profit to come in between $23.1 billion and $24.8 billion, up 10-18 percent from $21 billion in 2005. Merrill called HSBC's announcement surprising, as it was the first time in memory that the bank had released material information ahead of its results release. "We would have to increase our 2006 provision forecast by 24 percent to match the bank's new guidance," Merrill said in a research note. "This would result in a cut of nearly 10 percent to our 2006 net profit forecast of US$16.6 billion for HSBC." Merrill reiterated its "sell" rating.
