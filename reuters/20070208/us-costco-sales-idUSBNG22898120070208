 (Reuters) - Costco Wholesale Corp. ( COST.O ) on Thursday reported a 2 percent rise in January sales at its stores open at least a year, saying sales were hurt as the five-week period included one day less due to the New Year holiday. 


 Analysts, on average, had expected the company to post a same-store sales increase of 3.2 percent, according to estimates gathered by Reuters. Costco, the largest U.S. warehouse club operator, said net sales for the five weeks ended February 4, 2007 rose 7 percent to $5.57 billion from the same period last year. Costco, which operates 504 warehouses worldwide, said the timing of the New Year holiday led to one less day than last year and hurt the current year's comparable sales by about 3 percent. The company said in its statement that it plans to open an additional 16 to 17 new warehouses prior to the end of its 52-week 2007 fiscal year ending on September 2, 2007. (Reporting by Dilipp S.
