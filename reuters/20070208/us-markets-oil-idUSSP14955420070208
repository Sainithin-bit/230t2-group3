 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oil surged on Thursday amid signs of falling crude exports from producer group OPEC and rising tensions between the United States and Iran over its nuclear program. 


 News that Occidental Petroleum ( OXY.N ) was unable to meet supply contracts from a fire-stricken oil field in California added to the rise in prices, dealers said. U.S. crude oil CLc1 settled up $2.00, or 3.5 percent, to $59.71 a barrel, after Wednesday's $1.17 fall. London Brent crude LCOc1 settled up $1.80 at $59.03. "Kernels of bullish factors throughout the day were capped by this Occidental Petroleum update on their field, having no timetable for restart," said John Kilduff, senior vice president for energy risk management at Fimat USA. "Cinch that up with Iran-U.S. tensions, OPEC reductions in tanker tracking reports and it fueled the turn toward bullish sentiment before the weekend." OPEC's daily exports in January were down 200,000 barrels from December, according to shipping data from Lloyd's Marine Intelligence Unit, bringing the cartel closer to its pledged supply cuts. The group's exports are expected to edge even lower in February, oil consultancy Oil Movements said in a separate report. At meetings in October and December, OPEC agreed to remove 1.7 million barrels per day from the market by February. "It seems that the more reluctant OPEC members are slowly implementing cutbacks, so the resulting impact on inventories in a period of colder weather, coupled with anticipation of further cuts to come, could help push up prices," said David Dugdale, an analyst at MFC Global Investment Management. Adding support to oil prices, Iran's top authority, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said on Thursday the Islamic Republic would target U.S. interests around the world if it came under attack over its disputed nuclear program. Iran, the world's fourth-largest oil exporter, and the United States are locked in a war of words over Tehran's nuclear program, which Washington says is being channeled into bomb-building, a charge Tehran denies. Washington said the United States planned to stick to firm diplomacy, not go to war with the Islamic Republic. Meanwhile, a deep freeze in the United States was carving into the top energy consumer's thick fuel stockpiles, though some analysts said the cold would not be enough to launch oil prices back above $60 a barrel. "The bottom line is that distillate demand and the subsequent drawdown in stocks were just not large enough to provide the ammunition needed to break and stay over $60 a barrel," said Peter Beutel, an analyst at Cameron Hanover. Oil inventory data from the U.S. government on Wednesday showed stocks of distillates, which include heating oil, fell 3.7 million barrels last week, the biggest decline since October. But inventories remain close to last year's level, when winter brought record warmth that undercut demand. Oil's repeated failure to push beyond psychological resistance at $60 a barrel has triggered profit-taking after a nearly 20 percent climb since mid-January.
