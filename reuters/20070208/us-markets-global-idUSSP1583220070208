 LONDON  (Reuters) - Equities and emerging market assets held near record highs on Thursday as appetite for risk remained buoyant ahead of interest rate decisions in Europe and Britain and a meeting of the Group of Seven nations. 


 The yen fell ahead of the G7 meeting which starts on Friday in Essen, Germany, on doubts that finance chiefs will present a united front on the weakness of the Japanese currency, hovering near what the Bank of Japan says are two-decade lows. The weak yen and low borrowing costs in Japan have been used to finance investments across financial markets and some investors have expressed fears of a sudden unwinding of that so-called carry trade. "If we were to get some sort of communique from the G7 that policy makers were starting to get worried about the level of the yen, that potentially has a bigger impact on risk assets than what the Bank of England or the ECB says or does," said Richard Batley, an economist at UK-based fund manager Schroders. Neither the BOE or the European Central Bank are expected to raise interest rates on Thursday, but borrowing costs are expected to creep higher in the coming months. Worries about the potential removal of carry trade liquidity sparked a jump in volatility last year and while such an increase in volatility was possible, there was little to suggest a more serious vulnerability for risk assets, Batley said. "We have quite a sanguine, optimistic view...The liquidity is there and it's not going away." STOCKS NEAR HIGHS Stocks eased slightly, with the MSCI All-Country World Index dipping 0.2 percent from Wednesday's all-time high, while Europe's FTSEurofirst 300 was down 0.1 percent at 1,546 points, just off a six-year peak made the previous session. A profit warning from global banking giant HSBC knocked its shares 2.6 percent and weighed on markets, while oil majors such as BP dipped as oil prices eased. U.S. crude retreated below $58 a barrel after U.S. inventories data on Wednesday showed a drop in supplies of heating oil amid a cold snap in the Northeast, but not enough to push prices above $60 a barrel. Japan Nikkei average closed unchanged at 17,292.5 points as falls in shipping firms after their earnings report offset gains for technology shares. "Earnings reports from shipping companies were a negative surprise. But the market drew support from a weak yen," said Soichiro Monji, chief strategist at the equity management department of Daiwa SB Investments. YEN RETREATS The yen retreated against both the euro and the dollar as traders saw little chance of an official missive from the G7 about its recent weakness. "The ECB is the focus today but we've also got G7 in the back of everyone's mind. If they were to name the yen and Japan, euro/yen will probably be the hardest hit and therefore euro/dollar will come off," said Geoff Kendrick, currency strategist at Westpac. The ECB is widely expected to hold rates at 3.50 percent, shifting the focus to the tone of the post-decision news conference by president Jean-Claude Trichet. He is seen paving the way for a March hike by speaking of the need for "vigilance" on inflation. The euro dipped to $1.2990 ahead of the ECB, while the dollar rose half a percent on the day versus the yen to 121.20. The euro rose to 157.40 yen, recovering from Tuesday's 3-week low of 155.22 yen according to Reuters data and within range of a record high above 158.60 yen hit last month. Euro zone government bonds were little changed ahead of the rate decisions, with the 10-year Bund yield up 1.8 basis points at 4.04 percent, while the March Bund future was five ticks weaker at 115.50.
