 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Express Scripts Inc. ( ESRX.O ), which is mounting a hostile bid for rival Caremark Rx Inc. CMX.N, said on Thursday that profit rose 32 percent, beating analyst estimates, helped by higher use of generic drugs and lower retail and home-delivery drug purchasing costs. 


 The pharmacy benefit manager, which is seeking to derail an agreed acquisition of Caremark by drug-store chain CVS Corp. ( CVS.N ), also boosted its 2007 forecast, citing strong business trends. Express' board also approved an increase in the company's share buyback authorization to up to 14.1 million shares, or $1 billion, which would start if its Caremark bid falls through. "Without question, our first choice is to successfully complete the acquisition of Caremark," Chief Executive Officer George Paz said in a statement. However, Paz added, "If the Caremark stockholders vote in favor of the CVS proposal to acquire Caremark, we intend to promptly commence this share repurchase." Fourth-quarter net income rose to $147.2 million, or $1.07 per share, from $111.1 million, or 75 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, earnings were $1.02 per share. Analysts, on average, expected 97 cents. Express Scripts increased its 2007 per-share earnings forecast to a range of $4.08 to $4.20 from $3.90 to $4.02. It sees first-quarter per-share earnings of 90 cents to 95 cents, up from the previous view 85 cents to 90 cents. Analysts expect $3.94 for 2007 and 88 cents for the first quarter.
