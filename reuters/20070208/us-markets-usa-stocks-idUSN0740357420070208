 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. technology stocks rose on Wednesday as Cisco Systems'profit and outlook reinforced optimism over earnings, while blue chips ended little changed as an oil price drop weighed on energy shares. 


 Cisco's move supported the broader tech sector and pushed the S&P 500's technology index up nearly 0.8 percent. Apple Inc.'s stock climbed 2.4 percent, or $2.00, to close at $85.15 on Nasdaq. As regular trading ended, Apple ranked No. 1 among the Nasdaq 100's major advancers. "Cisco put people in the mood. I think the productivity numbers and unit labor costs are making people pretty bullish," said Ray Rund, managing director and head of research at Shaker Investments in Cleveland. Data showing slower growth in fourth-quarter wages and a jump in productivity supported the view that the Federal Reserve has no need to raise interest rates for now. The slide in oil futures prices, which had provided support to the broader market earlier in the session, dragged down the shares of major energy companies such as Exxon Mobil Corp. The Dow Jones industrial average inched up just 0.56 of a point to end at 12,666.87, after earlier touching an intraday record high at 12,700.28. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index gained 2.02 points, or 0.14 percent, to finish at 1,450.02, just shy of its six-year high at 1,452.99 reached earlier in the day, while the Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 19.01 points, or 0.77 percent, to close at 2,490.50. DISNEY'S AFTER-SCHOOL TREAT After the closing bell, shares of The Walt Disney Co. rose 2.5 percent after the company reported quarterly earnings that beat analysts' expectations. Shares of Disney, a Dow component, climbed to $36.38 in electronic extended-hours trading from a close at $35.48 on the New York Stock Exchange. EXXON DROPS, CISCO JUMPS During the regular session, the broader market pared its gains as Exxon Mobil shares declined 0.5 percent, making it one of the biggest decliners in both the Dow and the S&P 500. The price of oil fell more than $1 a barrel. Exxon Mobil shares fell 35 cents to close at $74.79 on the New York Stock Exchange. U.S. crude oil for March delivery slid $1.17, or 2 percent, to settle at $57.71 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange -- well below its NYMEX session high at $59.84. Cisco ranked near the top of the list of biggest gainers in both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 as its stock rose 3 percent, or 81 cents, to close at $28.09 on the Nasdaq. This marked Cisco's largest daily gain since November 28. The stock's surge came a day after the network equipment maker's quarterly earnings and outlook beat Wall Street's expectations. LIKE A VORNADO Shares of Vornado Realty Trust, another of the S&P 500's top performers, rallied after the company bowed out of the takeover battle over top U.S. office landlord Equity Office Properties Trust. Vornado's stock shot up almost 7 percent, or $8.75, to $135.75, while Equity Office shares slid 1.1 percent, or 60 cents, to $55.45, both in NYSE trading. A preliminary government report showed U.S. productivity beat expectations in the fourth quarter, while unit labor costs, one of the Federal Reserve's most closely watched inflation gauges, rose slightly less than predicted. Peter Morici, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Business, noted that this bodes well for corporate profits as companies will have greater scope to maintain or widen their profit margins on their domestic operations. Volume was moderate on the NYSE, where about 1.48 billion shares changed hands, below last year's estimated daily average of 1.84 billion. On Nasdaq, about 2.27 billion shares traded, above last year's daily average of 2.02 billion. Advancers outnumbered decliners by a ratio of about 7 to 5 on the NYSE and by about 3 to 2 on the Nasdaq.
