 SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - Germany's BMW ( BMWG.DE ), the world's biggest luxury carmaker, said on Thursday that sales in Asia rose 13.8 percent in 2006 to a record 126,949 vehicles and reiterated its goal to hit sales of 150,000 by next year. 


 The Munich-based company said in a statement that sales of BMW cars in Asia rose 15.5 percent in 2006 from the previous year to 109,848 units. Sales of its popular Mini in Asia rose 3.7 percent to 16,959 vehicles, while its ultra-luxury Rolls-Royce Phantoms sold 142 times -- 40 more than in 2005. Sales of BMW motorbikes were almost unchanged at 3,620. Japan, which accounts for the lion's share of sales in the region, recorded a 5.6 percent rise to 62,068 units, while China showed the strongest growth rate in Asia last year, up 35 percent to 44,700 vehicles. BMW, the world's biggest premium carmaker ahead of DaimlerChrysler's DCXGn.DE Mercedes-Benz, said production at its plant in Chennai in India's southern state of Tamil Nadu was due to open shortly, making it the group's fifth production site in Asia. Last month, BMW announced a 5 percent rise in 2006 group sales to a record 49 billion euros ($64 billion) and reaffirmed that its 2006 pretax earnings would hit 4 billion euros on the back of a 3.5 percent rise in unit sales to just over 1.37 million BMW, Mini and Rolls-Royce cars.
