 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Frigid winter winds blew life into U.S. retailers' January sales, as consumers snapped up cold weather clothes left on the shelves from the holiday season. 


 Redemption of gift cards also helped spur sales that topped the expectations of analysts across a broad spectrum of retailers, including department stores, discounters and teen clothing sellers. "Shoppers were out in force as a result of gift cards, the let-up in gas prices and favorable weather," said Frank Badillo, senior economist at Retail Forward. Still, retail stocks were mixed following the sales reports and the Standard & Poor's Retail Index .RLX was up 0.15 percent after reaching a life-time high on Wednesday. Fifty-nine percent of retailers beat forecasts, while 39 percent missed expectations, according to Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics. In aggregate, sales at stores open at least a year rose 3.9 percent, compared with expectations of 3.3 percent, the biggest positive surprise since last September. Arctic weather hit much of the United States in January, with parts of the country seeing record or near-record cold, according to weather-tracking firm Planalytics. That helped spur sales of winter clothing that had languished on store shelves during what Planalytics said was the warmest December in at least 10 years. DEPARTMENT STORES UP Federated Department Stores Inc. FD.N said gift cards and cold weather helped spur an 8.6 percent increase in same-store sales in January, which far outpaced is own forecast of a 1.5 percent to 3 percent increase and analysts' expectations for a 5 percent rise, according to a Reuters survey. Federated also raised its fourth quarter profit forecast and its shares rose more than 4 percent. Even struggling retailer Gap Inc. ( GPS.N ) managed to post flat sales at stores open at least a year in the four weeks ended January 27, the first time in a year sales did not decline at the clothing retailer, whose chief executive left the company in January. Gap also raised its full-year outlook and said the head designer for its Gap North America Division would leave the company. Its shares rose as much as 4.4 percent. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ), the world's largest retailer, confirmed on Thursday that sales at U.S. stores open at least a year rose a better-than-expected 2.2 percent. Other retailers that beat expectations included Limited Brands Inc. ( LTD.N ), where apparel sales and sales at its Bath & Body Works business helped offset markdowns that hurt its Victoria's Secret brand. Limited posted an 11 percent increase in same-store sales, beating the average analyst forecast of 8.1 percent compiled in a Reuters survey. Discounter Target Corp. ( TGT.N ) saw a 5.1 percent increase, in line with its own expectations, but ahead of the average analysts estimate. January, a month historically driven by clearance sales, has taken on greater importance in the past few years as gift cards rise in popularity. According to the National Retail Federation, $27.8 billion was spent on gift cards in November and December, topping its original estimate of $24.8 billion. WOMEN'S APPAREL, FURNITURE LAG Still, some women's apparel retailers missed expectations, even though they slashed prices on items such as cashmere sweaters just as temperatures dropped. AnnTaylor Stores Corp. ( ANN.N ) said same-store sales fell 10.2 percent, compared with the average analyst estimate of a 5.5 percent decline, while Chico's FAS Inc. ( CHS.N ) said same- store sales fell 3.5 percent, worse than the 1.5 percent decline expected by analysts. Home furnishings retailers also continued to perform poorly. Haverty Furniture Cos Inc. ( HVT.N ) said on Thursday that same-store sales fell 4.4 percent and its CEO said "the general trend for retail home furnishings sales remains sluggish." Last month, Ethan Allen Interiors Inc. ( ETH.N ) posted an 8.5 percent decline in comparable quarterly sales. The January sales period included five weeks for most retailers. But most retailers based their same-store sales comparison on a four-week period to match the year-earlier January sales period.
