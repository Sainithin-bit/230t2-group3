 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Online music service Napster Inc. posted a narrower third-quarter loss on Thursday that beat analysts' forecasts, citing strong subscription growth. 


 The company reported a net loss of $9.5 million, or 22 cents per share, for the period, compared with a loss of $17 million, or 40 cents per share, for the year earlier period. Net revenue rose to $28.4 million, including $2.4 million of nonrecurring revenue, from $23.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2006. Analysts on average had forecast Napster to post a loss of 29 cents and revenues of $28 million, according to Reuters Estimates. "The revenues looked a little light due to that nonrecurring revenue which had not been factored in," said Paul-Jon McNealy, analyst with American Technology Research. "Napster continues to find a way to survive in an increasingly tough environment on the music front," he said. Napster, which last September said it had hired investment bank UBS to look into several possibilities after it received "interest by third parties," on Thursday also said it had appointed Ross Levinsohn to its board of directors. Levinsohn in November resigned as president of News Corp.'s Fox Interactive Media, and is credited with convincing News Corp. Chief Executive Rupert Murdoch to buy popular social networking site MySpace.com and games Web network IGN Entertainment. Looking ahead, Napster said it expected fourth-quarter revenue to exceed $26 million and operating expenses to decline on a sequential basis. Analysts on average are looking for fourth-quarter revenue of $28.9 million and a loss of 24 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. In January Napster reached a deal to become the exclusive online music subscription service to AOL, the internet division of Time Warner Inc.. On Thursday, it said it expected the addition of several hundred thousand subscribers due to the AOL deal, resulting in record subscriber levels by fiscal year-end. It said the revenue impact of these new subscribers will be reflected in its June quarter.
