 SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - The first S$700 million ($457 million) phase of Singapore's massive underground oil storage project will be completed in four years, a government minister said on Thursday, two years later than initially planned. 


 The first phase to hold 1.47 million cubic meters (9.2 million barrel) will be commissioned in 2011, Lim Hng Kiang, minister for trade and industry, told reporters at a groundbreaking event. Last April, he had said the first caverns should be ready by 2009. Lim did not specifically address the apparent delay or say why the target for commissioning had changed. A second phase that could hold another 1.3 million cubic meters also remains under consideration, Lim said. A plan to convert the underground caverns to store oil has been under consideration for years and finally got the go-ahead last year as booming Asian oil demand, infrastructure constraints and rising trade flows created a hot market for storage tanks. In addition to the commercial benefits of the project, Singapore hopes the valuable infrastructure will attract more refining and petrochemical ventures to its shores and reinforce its reputation as Asia's main oil trading and blending center. But commercial operators like global leader Vopak ( VOPA.AS ), recently listed bunker fuel supplier Chemoil ( CHEL.SI ) and oil trader Hin Leong will pip the government to market with a host of projects that will double Singapore's independent oil tank capacity to about 8 million cubic meters by the end of next year. If both phases are completed, the cavern project could raise Singapore's capacity to near 11 million cubic meters (almost 70 million barrels) and some analysts and traders have questioned whether so much oil storage space will be needed. Lim expressed confidence, saying he expected customers to agree leases on the space even before it was completed. "I am told that both existing and new manufacturers on Jurong Island have expressed keen interest to utilize the Jurong Rock Cavern. JTC (Jurong Town Council) expects Phase 1 to be completely taken up prior to its completion," he said. The storage tanks will be built to hold liquids such as crude oil, condensate naphtha and gas oil. Lim also appeared to suggest that the facilities would be used only for commercial purposes, not for holding strategic government oil reserves, as some traders had speculated. "For both phases, the primary objective of the Jurong Rock Cavern will be to support the operations of Jurong Island manufacturers," he said. "This is no different from the existing business models on Jurong Island whereby manufacturers optimize plant operations and investments by outsourcing non-core activities such as logistics and utilities, to third-party service providers." For cost and operational reasons, underground caverns are often used to hold long-term strategic stocks rather than more actively traded barrels. The U.S. government stores its 700 million barrels of crude in four underground sites. ($ = S$1.5323)
