 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits rose a slightly less-than-expected 3,000 last week, a government report showed on Thursday, but remained at levels indicative of a healthy job market. 


 The Labor Department said 311,000 workers filed new claims for state unemployment insurance benefits in the week ended February 3, up from a revised 308,000 a week earlier. In a note, Action Economics pointed out that the jobless data have been volatile lately, largely due to holiday distortions. "Nevertheless, the data are consistent with a still tight labor market; that's not a revelation and the data shouldn't have much impact on the markets," it said. U.S. Treasuries were unchanged following the release of the data as traders cast an eye toward the upcoming auction of $9 billion worth of 30-year notes. A Labor Department analyst said there were no special factors behind the rise and that the tornado that struck central Florida on February 2 had no effect on the data. More than 1,500 homes, buildings and churches were damaged or destroyed across a wide area by severe thunderstorms and at least one tornado that killed at least 19 people. Private economists had expected the number of claims, a rough guide to the pace of layoffs, to rise to 313,000 from the original reading of 307,000 in the week ended January 27. "We are still at a pretty strong level in terms of job creation. The trend of jobless claims has been pretty low for a year or so," said Jon Basile, economist for Credit Suisse in New York. "It suggests a pretty healthy labor market. It's a sign of stability. Employers are not seeing any major downturn in the economy and are confident to maintain the same level of job growth," Basile said. The four-week moving average of new claims, viewed as a more accurate indicator of labor conditions because it smoothes weekly volatility, also rose, climbing to 308,250 from 305,000 in the week ended January 27. The number of people who remained on the benefit rolls after drawing an initial week of aid fell 54,000 to 2.49 million in the week ended January 27, the latest week for which figures are available.
