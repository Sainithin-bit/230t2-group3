 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc. ( CSCO.O ) said senior executive Mike Volpi resigned on Thursday, a move that appears to clear the way for Chief Development Officer Charles Giancarlo eventually to head the network equipment maker. 


 Volpi, head of Cisco's top-selling routers group, told reporters he resigned for personal reasons, effective immediately. Giancarlo remains in his post, but will oversee more senior executives as part of a management reshuffle that Cisco announced along with Volpi's departure. Volpi, 40, had reported to Giancarlo, 49, but both were widely viewed by analysts as the top candidates to succeed Chairman and Chief Executive John Chambers. Both have worked at Cisco for 13 years. Chambers, 56, has been CEO since January 1995. He has said he plans to remain for at least another few years. Giancarlo is responsible for Cisco's overall technology development, which includes not only its main business of making routers and switches that direct Internet traffic but also digital video, security, and wireless networking. Volpi, as general manager of the routing and service provider technology group, was responsible for all routing products and the company's strategy for the communications service provider market. He was also a key driver of Cisco's acquisition strategy and led 75 acquisitions between 1994 and 2001. Prudential analyst Inder Singh said Volpi was seen as a rising star, and while he may not have been equipped with the full breadth of knowledge to replace Chambers right away, he was clearly a top candidate. "Charlie Giancarlo will probably rise to the top... It's hard to find anyone as well rounded." Volpi was responsible for cable set-top box maker Scientific-Atlanta after Cisco acquired it last year in a move that heralded its push into the consumer entertainment market. The company said Jim McDonald, head of Scientific-Atlanta, and Paul Bosco, vice president of video and cable initiatives, now will report directly to Giancarlo. McDonald and Bosco had previously reported to Volpi. Volpi said his departure was unrelated to the management reshuffle. "It's a personal decision to move on to the next stage," Volpi told reporters on a conference call on Wednesday in comments that were allowed to be published on Thursday. He has not yet decided on his next career move, and for now planned to work as a consultant for Cisco. "I don't want to work with a competitor," he said. Giancarlo said Volpi was leaving Cisco on a "high note," noting growth at Scientific-Atlanta, which was a key contributor to Cisco's stronger-than-expected earnings announcement on Tuesday. "He is leaving at a time when the service provider market remains very strong and growing for Cisco," Giancarlo told reporters in the same telephone conference as Volpi. Cisco shares fell 13 cents to $27.96 in Thursday's Nasdaq trading.
