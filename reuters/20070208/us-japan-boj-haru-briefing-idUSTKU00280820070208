 SHIZUOKA, Japan  (Reuters) - Movements in the foreign exchange market are one important factor to watch in guiding monetary policy, although the yen's current weakness is positive for Japan's economy as a whole, Bank of Japan policy board member Hidehiko Haru said on Thursday . 


 "Foreign exchange rates have a very big impact on the economy, so I hope to closely watch their movements," Haru told a news conference after meeting business leaders in Shizuoka in central Japan. Haru said he did not know what specifically would be discussed at this week's meeting of the Group of Seven economic powers. He said there was no need to be particularly watchful of inflation risks in Japan's economy given tame price growth and the slow pace at which the strength of the corporate sector was spreading to households.
