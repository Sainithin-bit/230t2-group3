 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Bank of Japan Deputy Governor Kazumasa Iwata made no mention of monetary policy on Thursday in a speech at a meeting of local financial experts in Okinawa Prefecture in southern Japan, the text of his speech showed. 


 Traders had been waiting for Iwata's speech as well as comments from fellow BOJ board member Hidehiko Haru on Thursday for clues on whether the BOJ will raise interest rates at its meeting on February 20-21. But Iwata's speech mainly focused on the need to develop financial business in Okinawa. He said the BOJ would support Okinawa's efforts to help development the local economy as well as Japan's financial and economic systems. The central bank kept its key overnight call rate target at 0.25 percent in January after soft economic data including numbers on personal consumption and prices.
