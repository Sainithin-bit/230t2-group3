 LONDON  (Reuters) - Consumer goods giant Unilever Plc/NV reported underlying sales below analyst expectations on Thursday and gave a lackluster outlook for 2007, sending its shares lower. 


 The Anglo-Dutch maker of Sunsilk shampoo, Dove soap and Knorr soups posted fourth-quarter underlying sales growth of just 3.4 percent as Europe remained a tough market. Overall sales for the whole year only rose 3.8 percent. Unilever Plc shares traded off 2.2 percent at 13.92 pounds by 1110 GMT, the biggest fallers in the FTSE 100 index, while arch rival Reckitt Benckiser Plc was the biggest riser as it showed annual underlying sales up 7 percent. Unilever's fourth-quarter 3.4 percent rise came below a consensus expectation of 3.7 percent and the full-year year's 3.8 percent increase was behind a 4.0 percent expectation, while the group reiterated it expected to grow at 3 to 5 percent this year. "Results were below expectations for the fourth quarter and there was a muted outlook," said Morgan Stanley's Michael Steib. Paul Hofman at Van Lanschot Bankiers said: "A bit uninspiring (in the) fourth quarter, but positive trends remain intact". Unilever said Chief Financial Officer Rudy Markham, 60, will retire at its annual shareholder meetings in May at the same time as Michael Treschow takes over as chairman -- the first person from outside the company to take that post. The group will look inside and outside Unilever for a successor. Chief Executive Patrick Cescau said the outlook for 2007 was broadly unchanged, with demand modest in Europe and robust elsewhere, while he expected underlying sales growth of 3 to 5 percent and operating margins above 2006's 13.6 percent. He warned there was no let-up in the rise in food commodity prices, although prospects for its soap and shampoo home and personal care side looked more favorable in 2007 than in 2006. MARGIN SQUEEZE Unilever has now seen nine quarters of sales growth since its shock profit warning in September 2004 with rises of 2.9, 3.9 and 4.8 percent in the first three quarters of 2006, but its underlying margins -- stripping out one-off effects -- still slipped as it spent heavily to drive the recovery. "Fourth-quarter sales were underdone. Europe remains very difficult with Unilever having a rough time in France and there is still much to be done," said David Lang at Investec Securities. Paul Linssen at Petercam said the results were disappointing with revenue growth and profitability below expectations, indicating a slower recovery pace than anticipated. He said he would lower his earnings forecasts for 2007 and 2008 by 4 percent. Analysts believe Unilever should be able to grow at around 4 percent in the future, but still behind its European peers Nestle, Danone and Cadbury Schweppes Plc, which all report 2006 figures later this month. Reckitt, another rival which ranks as the world's biggest household cleaning group, saw its shares rise 5 percent to 26.09 pounds after reporting 7 percent underlying 2006 sales growth. Unilever's Cescau reiterated he expects his recovery strategy to lead to sustainable underlying sales growth of 3 to 5 percent and operating margins in excess of 15 percent by 2010 as the group raises marketing spending and cuts costs. Shares in Unilever, the world's third-biggest consumer goods group, still trade at a discount to its bigger rivals on 15.5 times consensus 2007 earnings, reflecting its slower growth, compared with Procter & Gamble Co. on 21.6 and Nestle on 17.6, according to Reuters Estimates. Unilever's 2006 earnings per share jumped 27 percent to 1.65 euros ($2.14), beating analysts' forecasts that ranged from 1.15 euros to 1.64 euros in a Reuters poll. It set a final dividend of 0.47 euros per NV share and 32.04p per Plc share, pushing its total payout up 6 percent.
