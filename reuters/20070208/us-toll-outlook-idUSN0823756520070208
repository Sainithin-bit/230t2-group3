 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Luxury home builder Toll Brothers Inc. ( TOL.N ) on Thursday said it expects to see a double-digit drop in fiscal first-quarter revenue and orders, but cancellations were down from the prior quarter. 


 However, the company said it expected to take a greater-than-expected first-quarter charge for the write-down of land values. Toll said preliminary results showed that home-building revenue fell 19 percent to $1.09 billion in its fiscal first quarter, ended in January. First-quarter net contracts fell 33 percent to 1,027 units, while the value fell 34 percent to $749 million. "It appears that the pace of cancellations is starting to abate," Robert Toll, chairman and chief executive, said in a release. The first-quarter cancellation rate was 29.8 percent, down from the prior quarter's rate of 36.9 percent, but still well above the company's historic average of about 7 percent. "A few markets, such as Hoboken, Jersey City, Manhattan and Brooklyn, are quite strong," Toll said. "Some markets, such as Detroit, Minneapolis, Chicago, Reno and parts of Florida, may not yet have stabilized." Even so, the company said it expects to take a first-quarter charge for the write-down of land values of at least $60 million and it could exceed $160 million.
