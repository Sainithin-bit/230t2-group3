 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Federated Department Stores Inc. FD.N on Thursday reported a better-than-expected rise in January sales at stores open at least one fiscal year and raised its quarterly earnings forecast, sending its shares up nearly 4 percent. 


 The parent of Macy's and Bloomingdale's said gift cards and demand for cold weather goods had aided January same-store sales, which rose 8.6 percent. Analysts on average had been expecting an increase of 5 percent, according to a Reuters survey, and Federated had forecast a gain of 1.5 percent to 3 percent. The Cincinnati, Ohio-based company said total sales for the five weeks ended February 3 rose 19 percent to $1.78 billion. Federated also cited "continued improvement" in sales trends at former May Co. stores that have been converted to the Macy's nameplate. Former May locations that have been open for more than one fiscal year will be included in same-store sales beginning in February, it added. For February, Federated expects same-store sales to rise 2 percent to 3 percent. The company now expects profit of $1.55 to $1.60 a share from continuing operations, excluding merger costs and related inventory adjustments, for the fourth quarter, which also ended on February 3. That's up from its previous forecast of $1.40 to $1.50 a share. The revised forecast includes a one-time gain of 6 cents a share tied to completion of a debt tender offer. For the fourth quarter, analysts expect Federated to post profit of $1.47 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales for the fourth quarter, which had 14 weeks, came to $9.16 billion, down 4.3 percent from $9.57 billion in the year-earlier period, which had 13 weeks. Analysts were expecting $9.14 billion. Federated shares were up $1.62, or 3.9 percent, at $42.94 in morning New York Stock Exchange trading.
