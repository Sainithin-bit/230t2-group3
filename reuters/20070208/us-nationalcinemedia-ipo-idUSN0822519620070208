 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of National CineMedia Inc. ( NCMI.O ), which sells movie theater advertising services, proved a blockbuster themselves, jumped as much as 26 percent in their market debut on Thursday amid a parade of hot new issues. 


 Despite weaker U.S. equity markets on Thursday, a quartet of offerings from a range of sectors soared in U.S. openings, a sign of strong investor demand for initial public offerings despite a sluggish start to the year, analysts said. The flurry of strong IPOs sets the table for Fortress Investment Group LLC, the first hedge fund to go public in the United States, which is scheduled to price later on Thursday. "The stocks have continued to deliver" even after pricing at the top or above forecast ranges, said David Menlow, president of IPOfinancial.com, adding that the IPO market was at a 'good stage'. "It's not showing excesses." All four stocks debuting on Thursday posted double-digit gains, led by Accuray Inc. ( ARAY.O ), which makes robotic medical devices. Shares of the company closed at $28.47 or up 58 percent. Shares of Israel's Mellanox Technologies Ltd. ( MLNX.O ), which supplies semiconductors used to transfer data between computer servers and storage systems, climbed as much as 23 percent and closed at $20, up 17.7 percent. Shares of Switch and Data Inc. SDXC.O, which provides connections to the Internet, opened 29 percent higher, but closed at $19, up 11.8 percent. MOVIE Theater ADVERTISING On Wednesday, National CineMedia raised $798 million with an IPO of 38 million shares that sold for $21 per share, above the forecasted range of $18 to $20. National CineMedia, the biggest IPO of the year by value, operates an advertising sales and marketing business that uses movie screens and monitors in theater lobbies. The company is in a position to benefit from marketers' efforts to find new advertising mediums, Research Associates analyst Marla Backer said in a note in January. "(National CineMedia) offers the only pure-play exposure to the cinema advertising niche. Growth in this niche has outpaced that of overall ad spending for several years, as marketers have sought alternatives to traditional ad media." While the company lacks direct competition for its services, National CineMedia shares carries a high price to earnings multiple. At the company's $25.67 closing price, the company trades at more than 109 times annualized pro forma earnings from 2006. The movie industry also faces greater competition from the Internet and video games, as well as the spread of large-screen, high-definition TV and digital video recorders. But upcoming films include sequels to blockbuster franchises "Spider-Man," "Shrek," "Harry Potter" and "Pirates of the Caribbean," buoying prospects for box office receipts. Net proceeds from the IPO will go to the founding members of National CineMedia -- theater operators Regal Entertainment Group ( RGC.N ), Cinemark Inc. and AMC Entertainment Inc. Cinemark and AMC have filed for their own IPOs. National CineMedia, based in Centennial, Colorado, is a holding company with its sole asset a 40.5 percent stake in National CineMedia LLC, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Underwriters, led by Credit Suisse, JPMorgan, Lehman Brothers and Morgan Stanley, have the option to buy an additional 4 million shares to cover overallotments, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
