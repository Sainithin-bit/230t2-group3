 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Thursday as warnings of losses stemming from bad home loans by two of the top three U.S. subprime mortgage lenders hurt shares of home loan companies and banks like Citigroup Inc.( C.N ) 


 Britain's HSBC Holdings Plc ( HSBA.L ) and New Century Financial Corp. NEW.N disclosed mounting losses from defaults on mortgages to Americans with shaky credit histories, driving their shares down sharply and punishing the broader financial services sector. For details see <ID:nN08246451> Investors are unconvinced that the U.S. housing market has stabilized after its worst decline in many years as Toll Brothers Inc. ( TOL.N ) said home-building revenue will fall significantly, while shares of New Century tumbled over 30 percent, its largest daily loss since June 1997. "HSBC is a red flag. Investors worldwide were nearly convinced that we'd seen the worst that was going to happen to the U.S. housing market and it was going to work its way higher," said Mike Driscoll, listed trader and managing director of Bear Stearns in New York. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  fell 29.24 points, or 0.23 percent, to close at 12,637.63, while the Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  slipped 1.71 points, or 0.12 percent, to finish at 1,448.31. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  edged down 1.83 points, or 0.07 percent, to end at 2,488.67. The financial services sector was one of the worst-performing groups within the S&P 500 as concern about mortgage delinquencies weighed on Citigroup Inc.( C.N ) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. ( JPM.N ), reflecting investors' worries that the housing slowdown may further damage economic growth. The New York-listed shares of HSBC HBC.N, one of the largest U.S. subprime mortgage lenders, dropped 2.7 percent, or $2.44, to $89.78 on the New York Stock Exchange. In turn, the shares of New Century plunged 36.2 percent, or $10.92, to $19.24, making it the NYSE's biggest percentage decliner. Citigroup dropped almost 1 percent, or 51 cents, to $54.44, dragging on the blue-chip Dow average and the S&P 500, while shares of Dow component JPMorgan fell 0.6 percent, or 28 cents, to $50.93. Shares of top U.S. mortgage lender Countrywide Financial Corp.CFC.N lost 2.6 percent, or $1.15, to $43.59, while Washington Mutual Inc. ( WM.N ) shares slid 2.6 percent, or $1.18, to $44.17. Luxury home builder Toll Brothers' stock slid 3 percent, or $1.04, to $33.39 after the company said it expects a 19 percent drop in home-building revenue. <ID:nN08491600>. This triggered a loss of 2.7 percent in the Dow Jones U.S. Home Construction index .DJUSHB. ENERGY SECTOR HELPS LIMIT LOSSES Late in the session, the Dow and the S&P 500 trimmed some of their losses after a jump of $2 in the price of crude oil gave investors a reason to buy shares of major energy companies, including Exxon Mobil Corp. ( XOM.N ) and Chevron Corp. ( CVX.N ). Exxon Mobil shares rose almost 1 percent, or 67 cents, to $75.46, while Chevron's stock gained 1.5 percent, or $1.11, to $73.75 in NYSE trading. Crude oil futures for March delivery CLH7 rose $2.00 to settle at $59.71 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The semiconductor sector was the second-heaviest weight on the Nasdaq 100 as shares of Maxim Integrated Products Inc. ( MXIM.O ) fell 2.6 percent, or 84 cents, to $31.11. The stock slid a day after Maxim, a maker of mixed-signal microchips, reported higher quarterly revenue, but gave no profit figure due to a review of its past stock options. <ID:nWEN3808> Intel Corp.( INTC.O ), the world's dominant chip maker, slipped 0.7 percent, or 15 cents, to $21.36 on Nasdaq. Trading was active on the NYSE, with about 1.61 billion shares changing hands, below last year's estimated daily average of 1.84 billion, while on Nasdaq, about 2.05 billion shares traded, above last year's daily average of 2.02 billion. Declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones by a ratio of about 17 to 16 on the NYSE. On the Nasdaq, it was more evenly matched, with 1,540 shares declining and 1,485 rising.
