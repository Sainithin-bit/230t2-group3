 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration on Wednesday proposed a $2.9 million civil penalty against American Eagle Airlines for using airplanes with improper repairs that compromised safety. 

 In a statement the FAA said American Eagle Airlines, a unit of AMR Corp, operated more than 1,000 flights using airplanes in which repair procedures on landing gear doors were not followed. Those flights took place between February and May of 2008, carrying passengers on four Bombardier jets with main landing gear doors not repaired in accordance with standards that became effective in August 2006. "Airlines must know that if safety is compromised, they will be subject to stiff fines," Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said in a statement.
