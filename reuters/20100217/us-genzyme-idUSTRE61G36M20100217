 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Genzyme Corp GENZ.O said on Wednesday it is on the way to resolving a manufacturing crisis that led to shortages of two key drugs, but it is still struggling to meet patient demand. 

 The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based biotech company was forced last year to close its Allston Landing plant in Boston due to a viral contamination, which interrupted supply of its top-selling drug Cerezyme, a treatment for Gaucher disease, and Fabrazyme, its treatment for Fabry disease. As a result, Genzyme's fourth-quarter earnings fell 73 percent and it posted a lower-than-expected outlook for 2010. Henri Termeer, the company's chief executive, told analysts on a conference call that the company is recovering and regaining momentum. But earnings will be hurt as it spends to improve infrastructure, and cuts shipments of Cerezyme to build inventory. Fourth-quarter net earnings fell 73 percent to $23.2 million, or 9 cents a share, while revenue declined to $1.08 billion from $1.17 billion. Excluding one-time items, the company earned 31 cents a share, topping the average forecast from analysts of 28 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It expects 2010 earnings of $2.80 a share to $3.20 a share excluding one-time items. Analysts on average were predicting $3.24 a share. The company, which is racing to clean up its problems in the face of a likely proxy assault from billionaire investor Carl Icahn, said its outlook is dependent on winning approval for Lumizyme, the U.S. version of its Pompe disease drug Myozyme. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is scheduled to rule by June 17 on whether to approve the drug. The outlook also depends on its ability to boost supplies of Cerezyme and Fabrazyme. The company said it plans to cut shipments of Cerezyme by 50 percent for about two months in order to build up a buffer of inventory. Roughly 85 percent of patients who were taking Cerezyme before the manufacturing crisis are back on it. Genzyme said, however, that production of Fabrazyme remains below par and the company is only able to supply patients with 30 percent of their normal dose. In order to increase productivity, Genzyme said it has made a change to its manufacturing process, which must be approved by the FDA. The company is using a new working cell bank to produce Fabrazyme, which like many biotechnology drugs is made in living cells and produced in big bioreactors. The company expects to harvest product from the new cell bank in June. In the meantime, the company said it expects sales of Fabrazyme to fall in 2010. Genzyme said it expects 2010 revenue of $5.23 billion to $5.53 billion. Analysts expect $5.275 billion. The company said this year it is focusing on strengthening core businesses and reducing risk by making investments to expand manufacturing capacity and improve its information technology infrastructure. Genzyme shares fell 4 cents to $55.47 in afternoon trading on Nasdaq. (Reporting by Toni Clarke; editing by Gerald E. McCormick, Dave Zimmerman)
