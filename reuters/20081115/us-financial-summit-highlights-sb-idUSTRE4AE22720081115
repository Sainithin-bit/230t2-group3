 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Leaders of advanced and major developing countries are set to unveil an action plan on Saturday to tackle the financial crisis and restore confidence in a global economy fast tumbling into recession. 

 Below are comments they made on Saturday in relation to the Group of 20 leaders' summit, which wraps up here in Washington later in the day. U.S. PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH: Summit leaders were looking for "a way forward to make sure that such a crisis is unlikely to occur again." "I am pleased that the leaders reaffirmed the principles behind open markets and free trade," he told reporters before the talks resumed. "One of the dangers during a crisis such as this is that people will start implementing protectionist policies." "This crisis has not ended. There's some progress being made but there's still a lot more work to be done." U.K. PRIME MINISTER GORDON BROWN: He said the G20 financial crisis talks were "difficult." "These are tough talks because countries are coming from very different positions and we have to bring them together," he said. "It's obviously important to move people to decisions today about what can be done." Brown has been urging the G20 to act together to stimulate economic activity via fiscal and monetary policy means. "This is difficult for some countries," he said. "We're in an environment where there is very low inflation and therefore scope for action." "We've got to see how countries will respond on the fiscal side. The important thing is the recognition, which has not been true in previous downturns, of the importance of fiscal policy. The reasons why fiscal policy -- I was saying to our colleagues in the G20 -- matters more is that we are in a period where we expect low inflation. If inflation was very high and likely to rise, then the argument about fiscal policy would be different because we would be worried about the longer-term effects on the economy. In a period of low inflation, in fact when inflation is coming down very fast, the case for fiscal policy is far stronger indeed." On the role of the IMF: "The IMF should have a bigger role in helping distressed economies and the World Bank should play a far bigger role in helping developing countries who have been hit by oil prices and food price rises. There's a flight of capital from these countries that is very worrying for the developing countries and we are hoping the World Bank will be able to come in with a major support system back up by the IMF for distressed economies." On monetary policy: "Obviously most of the decisions about monetary policy are rightly made by the central banks and the question is how central banks view the current conditions of the economy and my point is that we are in an environment where there is very low inflation and therefore there is scope for action. On reforms of the banking system and international institutions: "There are different positions of view about what should be done. But again I believe that is possible that we will get a timetable for immediate reforms of the current banking and financial system. "I think we will get an agreement, if my sense of last night is right, that at a next meeting we'll have a plan for the detailed reform of the international financial institutions brought forward." On trade and open markets: "There is a general recognition that if protectionism starts to grow in any continent or any country then the chances of the world economy is diminished." GERMAN CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL: "This action plan shows that we are able to act," she told reporters. "The action-plan will contain around 50 measures, which will be put into reality until end of March." "This is a new start, we are marking." "The principle is, that there should be no markets, not actors in financial markets and not product which will be without supervision or regulation."
