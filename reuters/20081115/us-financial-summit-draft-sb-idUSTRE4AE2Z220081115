 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - World leaders agreed on Saturday that they would work together to restore economic growth and achieve reform in the world's financial system, according to a draft summit declaration. 

 "Our work will be guided by a shared belief that market principles, open trade and investment regimes, and effectively regulated financial markets foster the dynamism, innovation and entrepreneurship that are essential for economic growth, employment and poverty reduction," the text said.
