 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Canada expects this weekend's G20 summit on the financial crisis to directly address the exchange rate of China's currency as part of discussions about measures that can be taken to restore global economic growth. 

 "We expect there'll be frank discussion around that," a senior Canadian official told reporters shortly before the start of the summit in Washington. "Having the market dictate the value of currencies would be a positive step and one of the ways to address the imbalances that we're seeing." (Reporting by  Randall Palmer , Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
