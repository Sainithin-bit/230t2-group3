 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The White House on Saturday said it was not proposing relaxing fuel efficiency requirements as part of efforts to speed up government loans to the ailing auto industry. 

 White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said media reports saying that was a White House proposal were "false." "The president proposed these efficiency standards, Congress enacted them, and we're in the process of implementing them. We are not proposing relaxing them," she said in a statement.
