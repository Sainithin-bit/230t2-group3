 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Officials from leading economies have finalized a communique for a global leaders summit on the financial crisis and it addresses the need for better regulation, a German official said. 

 "The communique will contain the principle that no financial market, nor actor on the financial markets and no region should be without regulation or supervision," the official said shortly before leaders were due to meet on Saturday. The document also calls on hedge funds to provide more transparency about their operations, the official said. (Reporting by  Gernot Heller , Editing by Andrea Ricci)
