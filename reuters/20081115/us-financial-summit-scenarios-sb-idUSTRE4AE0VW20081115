 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Leaders from major developed and emerging countries wrap up their G20 summit on Saturday and are expected to unveil a plan for repairing the world financial system, ravaged by the credit crisis. 

 Here is what to expect. WHAT HAPPENS SATURDAY: - G20 leaders meet for four hours in Washington. U.S. President George W. Bush gives a statement at 2005 gmt/1505, and a formal communique probably will be released. Individual leaders hold news briefings before leaving Washington. WHAT AGREEMENTS TO EXPECT: Leaders are likely to promise quick action to boost growth and then lay out a broad framework for further discussions on market reforms, financial regulation and a revamp of the international financial order. Look for these details: ECONOMY: Promises for prompt action to boost economic growth and stabilize financial markets. This may include support for major fiscal stimulus plans, particularly in developed countries where needed REGULATIONS: Broad principles on how to regulate markets and financial institutions in order to prevent future crises - Expanded role for the Financial Stability Forum, an advisory body of financial regulators from rich nations which gives policy recommendations - Action plan on how to implement these regulatory policies, with each country having the discretion to adopt them as it considers appropriate GLOBAL FINANCIAL ORDER: - Review of the International Monetary Fund's role as policeman for financial and economic stability - Possibly more say for emerging countries in global financial bodies including the IMF, G7 and FSF, or an agreement to examine the issue further - Possibly increased IMF funding WHAT'S NEXT: - G20 leaders are likely to meet again in the first three months of 2009 -- once U.S. President-elect Barack Obama has taken office and after finance ministers have thrashed out more concrete details. A date may be set this weekend. - Britain, as next year's G20 chair, may be the host. Japan and Italy, the current and 2009 heads of the G7 group of richest nations, respectively, have also volunteered. - Discussions on global financial governance are likely to feature strongly at the spring IMF meetings in Washington. G7 finance ministers also meet at this April event.
