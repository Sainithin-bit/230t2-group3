 CARACAS  (Reuters) - Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez said an emergency economy meeting of world leaders in Washington was a "waste of time" that excluded the poor and was hosted by people responsible for the global financial meltdown. 

 Socialist Chavez is a fierce critic of the United States and avowed foe of outgoing U.S. President George W. Bush. He blames the world economic slowdown on unbridled capitalism run wild. Leaders representing the G20 group of countries descended on Washington on Friday at the start of a crisis meeting to discuss ways to stimulate the world economy. "Really, I don't know what they are going to do in Washington, the host is to blame," Chavez said. "They are going waste their time" The former para-trooper, who casts himself as a spokesman for the world's downtrodden masses, said he was planning to call an alternative meeting of leaders of poor countries in Caracas to discuss the economic crisis. "We the little countries were not even consulted or asked," Chavez said of the G20 meeting. "We are calling a meeting of small countries," Chavez said. "One small thing together with other small things creates big things." Chavez did not miss an opportunity to take a pop at Bush, who he has previously called a donkey, a drunkard and Mr Danger and who he says did not do enough to stop the crisis. "What can a president like that propose? A president who caused this great catastrophe," he said. Chavez said even if he had been invited he would not have gone to the Washington meeting, although he would have considered an invitation from president-elect Barack Obama.
