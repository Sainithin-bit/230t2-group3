 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. President George W. Bush Saturday hailed this weekend's global economic summit as a success, saying leaders agreed to pursue pro-growth policies, but insisted more work still needed to be done in tackling the financial crisis. 

 "There was a common understanding by all of us that we should take pro-growth economic policies," Bush told reporters after the Washington summit was finished. "It makes sense to come out of here with a firm action plan, which we have, and it also makes sense to say to people that there is more work to be done, and there will be more meetings," he added.
