 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Carnival Corp & Plc ( CCL.N ) ( CCL.L ) lifted its 2009 earnings forecast on Tuesday and said ticket prices for its cruises were stabilizing, boosting shares of the world's largest cruise operator as much as 9 percent. 

 Bookings for the next three quarters were 19 percent ahead of 2008 levels, spurred in part by heavy discounting. Travelers are also booking cruises earlier, which has helped rates stabilize, Carnival noted. Chief Operating Officer Howard Frank said during a call that rates were unlikely to fall further in the fourth quarter, given the strength of late bookings. "For a limited number of itineraries ... we have been able to move prices up," added Frank, who also acts as Carnival's vice chairman. Frank said 2010 would likely be a stable year, but rising unemployment and the housing crisis remained major obstacles to a full recovery. "It is going to be a fairly stable environment, maybe slightly improving, but nothing more than that," he said. Carnival expects to earn between $2.16 and $2.20 per share in 2009, an increase from its earlier range of $2.00 to $2.10. The company sees a 14 percent drop in net revenue yields, a key measure of revenue performance in the industry. The company added that fuel prices would be higher than forecast in 2009, costing the company 5 cents per share. This would be partially offset by a weaker dollar, which would contribute 3 cents per share. Shares of Miami-based Carnival spiked 7 percent to $34.27 on the New York Stock Exchange in afternoon trading. Its main rival, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd ( RCL.N ) ( RCL.OL ), saw its stock jump 4.1 percent to $24.20. Carnival's credit default swaps tightened on Tuesday, meaning that it cost less to insure the company's debt against the risk of default than late last week, traders said. THIRD-QUARTER RESULTS BEAT ESTIMATES For the third quarter, ended August 31, Carnival reported a net profit of $1.1 billion, or $1.33 per share, surpassing analyst estimates of $1.18 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue sank more than 14 percent to about $4.1 billion. Net revenue yields fell 16.4 percent, while costs, including fuel, fell 11.4 percent. Carnival benefited from a 39 percent drop in fuel costs. In the fourth quarter, Carnival expects earnings of 16 cents to 20 cents per share. On average, analysts expect 23 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Shares of Carnival, which are components of the S&P 500 and the FTSE 100 indexes, have doubled since early March amid signs that economic recovery is under way. In the third quarter, European cruises saw smaller declines in fares than North American offerings, said Bernstein Research analyst Janet Brashear in a note. Europe is a major growth area for Carnival and the company plans to expand capacity there by 12 percent in 2010. Overall capacity is expected to jump 7.7 percent. But Goldman Sachs analyst Steven Kent said the outlook for close-in bookings remained murky, and rising fuel costs and a resurgence of the H1N1 flu could hurt results. During the call, Carnival said the flu reduced net revenue yields by 1.4 points in the third quarter. "We remain cautious on the cruise stocks given our view that the cruise industry's long-term risks are not going away (lack of pricing power due to oversupply and the fuel conundrum)," wrote Kent, who has a "sell" rating on Carnival.
