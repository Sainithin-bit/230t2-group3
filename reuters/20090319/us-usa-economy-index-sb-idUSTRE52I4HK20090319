 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Conference Board's index of Leading Economic Indicators fell 0.4 percent in February, indicating that the recession will continue in the near-term, with a return to strong growth unlikely until 2010. 

 "Financial market volatility remains strong and the credit squeeze and the credit market freeze is relenting very slowly," said Ken Goldstein, an economist for the research group, in a statement. "A return to strong growth will not likely occur until 2010." Wall Street analysts had expected the leading index, a gauge of future economic conditions, to fall 0.6 percent in February. The index rose by a revised 0.1 percent in January, previously reported as a 0.4 percent increase. (Reporting by  Lucia Mutikani ; Editing by Theodore d'Afflisio)
