 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - General Electric Co's forecasting shows that even under the Federal Reserve's adverse-case scenario for the U.S. economy in 2009, its GE Capital unit should have at least break-even results, the unit's head said on Thursday. 

 Based on the Fed's base-case scenario for the economy, profit would come to $2 billion to $2.5 billion. "Even in the adverse case we're probably break-even to slightly profitable," said Michael Neal, chief executive of GE Capital In December, the U.S. conglomerate had forecast that the GE Capital unit would earn about $5 billion in 2009.
