 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The number of U.S. workers drawing state unemployment benefits scaled another record high early this month, government data showed on Thursday, highlighting the difficulties of getting new jobs as the economy battles a severe recession. 

 KEY POINTS: * However, the number of people filing new claims for jobless benefits fell to a seasonally adjusted 646,000 in the week ended March 14, the Labor Department said, still at levels consistent with a distressed labor market. The prior week's number was revised up to 658,000 from 654,000. * Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast 652,000 new claims. COMMENTS: NICK BENNENBROEK, HEAD OF FX STRATEGY, WELLS FARGO, NEW YORK: "The dollar did get a slight pop on the number, but it's no more than a blip. We're getting mixed messages from the jobless number. The headline figure fell but continuing claims rose. Overall, the data's impact should fade and the dollar should continue to weaken because the markets are still digesting the Fed's decision on buying long-term treasury debt." T.J. MARTA, FOUNDER AND MARKET STRATEGIST, MARTA ON THE MARKETS, SCOTCH PLAINS, NEW JERSEY: "You see initial claims coming down a bit and an upside surprise on continuing claims. From a longer term perspective what concerns me about the U.S. economy isn't the spike in initial claims, it's the grinding nature of this slowdown and how slow moving the effects of the financial crisis are proving to be." "The job market downturn will last longer than any other job downturn in recent history." "Treasuries are holding their gains, which ties into the fact that the Fed knocked the ball out of the park yesterday and as the market moves to an appreciation that the Fed would not have done what it did unless there was a huge underlying problem in both the financial markets and economy." ZACH PANDL, ECONOMIST, NOMURA SECURITIES, NEW YORK: "This report doesn't change much of our view on the labor market here. Jobs conditions are still very difficult, and the unemployment rate doubtless is going to continue to rise for the rest of the year. "The main message on the labor market is that we have seen a little bit of improvement in consumer spending, after a very depressed holiday shopping season, and that's been an encouraging sign on the economy... "It's going to be difficult for consumers to sustain growth and spending with the weakness in the labor market, and therefore income. "I would say all in line with expectations. For the market today it's going to be about continuing to digest the announcement from the Fed yesterday. There's still a lot of uncertainty around what affects these programs are going to have." SUBODH KUMAR, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, SUBODH KUMAR &  ASSOCIATES, TORONTO: "The data continues to show a tough labor market, but the market will today be focused more on the aggressive policy move by the Fed. We should see some continuation of the rally we saw yesterday on the stock side, though not to the same extent as yesterday's rally. On the bond side, yesterday's rally will flatten. "Overall the data collaborates that the Fed needs to be more aggressive, which is what they're doing." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. equity index futures hold gains. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices ad slight gains. DOLLAR: Euro pares gains versus U.S. dollar.
