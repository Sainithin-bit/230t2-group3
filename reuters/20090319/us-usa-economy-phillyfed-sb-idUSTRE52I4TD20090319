 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Factory activity in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic region shrank less severely in March, a survey showed on Thursday, but slumps in employment, new orders and investment plans painted a bleak outlook. 

 The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank reported its business activity index at minus 35.0 in March versus minus 41.3 in February. Any reading below zero indicates contraction in the region's manufacturing sector. The result was better than expected but the report's reading on employment hit its lowest since the survey's launch in 1968 while the gauge of new orders fell to its weakest since July 1980. "It's still negative, but there is more stability than what we saw in the fourth quarter," said Michael Woolfolk, senior currency strategist, Bank of New York-Mellon in New York. "It's not surprising, given the pace of decline we saw in that quarter, so we're not seeing a recovery in the manufacturing sector yet. But we are seeing a degree of stabilization." Economists had expected a result of minus 38.0, according to the median of 53 forecasts in a Reuters poll, which ranged from minus 45.1 to negative 30.0. On Wall Street, stocks initially lost more ground but later moved higher. Prices of U.S. government bonds, which tend to benefit from signs of economic weakness, ticked slightly higher. The survey covers factories in a region emcompassing eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware and is looked at closely as one of the first indicators of the health of the U.S. manufacturing sector. Its suggestions for the future were grim, considering the fall in the new orders index, while the weak employment component highlighted the slumping job market's drag on the economy. Indicating a slump in new business investments, the March index for the 6-month capital spending outlook fell to its lowest since the survey started. (Additional Reporting by Steven C.
