 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of Citigroup ( C.N ) pared earlier gains as the stock resumed trading before the opening bell. 

 The stock rose 5.5 percent to $3.25 before the bell but was off from an earlier jump that lifted it as much as 11 percent. Citigroup said in a regulatory filing it was proposing an exchange offer of preferred shares that would substantially increase the U.S. government's ownership in the bank. As part of the plan, Citigroup would conduct a reverse stock split, reducing its share count and boosting its share price. (Reporting by  Ellis Mnyandu ; Editing by Kenneth Barry)
