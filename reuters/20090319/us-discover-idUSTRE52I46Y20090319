 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Discover Financial Services ( DFS.N ), the fourth-largest U.S. credit card network, posted a deeper-than-expected quarterly operating losses on Thursday, cut its dividend and set aside more money to cover bad loans as credit defaults mounted. 

 The Riverwoods, Illinois-based company reported an operating loss of $177 million, or 36 cents per share, for the fiscal first quarter, ended February 28, compared with operating earnings of $239 million, or 50 cents per share, a year earlier. On that basis, analysts had expected a loss of 14 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Discover cut its quarterly dividend to 2 cents per share from 6 cents to strengthen its capital base, a move that will save $80 million annually. With default rates at the highest level in 20 years, credit card companies are the latest victims of a economic crisis that began with the collapse of the U.S. housing and subprime mortgage markets and spread around the world. Discover's chargeoff rate -- the percentage of debt it does not expect to be repaid -- climbed to 6.48 percent from 5.48 in the fourth quarter. Its 30-day delinquency rate rose to 5.25 percent from 4.56 percent. First-quarter net income was $120 million, or 25 cents per share, boosted by $297 million from an antitrust settlement with Visa Inc ( V.N ) and MasterCard Inc ( MA.N ). Year-earlier net income was $81 million, or 17 cents per share. The company set aside $707 million in the first quarter to cover credit losses as the recession deepens and unemployment soars. Managed loans were flat at $51 billion, but Discover Card sales volume fell 8 percent to $21 billion. Discover shares were unchanged at $7.24 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has lost one-fourth of its value so far in 2009 and is down 50 percent in the last 12 months. (Reporting by  Juan Lagorio , editing by John Wallace)
