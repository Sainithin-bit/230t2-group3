 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Connecticut's Attorney General Richard Blumenthal urged executives at insurance giant American International Group on Thursday to return bonuses he said they do not deserve. 

 He said his office is demanding information on the bonuses that the company paid to employees and urged those employees to "do the right thing" and return the money. "They do not deserve this money, and they did not earn it," Blumenthal said in a statement. (Reporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss; editing by Carol Bishopric)
