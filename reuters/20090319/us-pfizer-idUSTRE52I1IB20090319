 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc ( PFE.N ) may have to shed some of its animal-health business so that it can gain antitrust clearance for its planned purchase of Wyeth WYE.N, the Wall Street Journal cited a Pfizer executive as saying on Wednesday. 

 But any potential asset sales would probably be less than 10 percent of Pfizer's combined animal-health revenue, Chief Financial Officer Frank D'Amelio told investors at a Cowen & Co conference in Boston, the paper said. Pfizer has a strong presence in companion and livestock animal-health products, while Wyeth is strong in animal vaccines, the paper cited D'Amelio as saying. D'Amelio added that the companies also overlapped in those areas, and talks with antitrust authorities were ongoing, the paper said. Pfizer said in January it would buy Wyeth in a deal then valued at $68 billion. (Reporting by  S. John Tilak  in Bangalore, editing by Will Waterman)
