 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - U.S. drugs giant Pfizer Inc ( PFE.N ) is eyeing takeovers as a way to boost its generics business, German business daily Handeslblatt quoted a top company executive as saying. 

 "We want to expand our product portfolio in this area," it quoted generics division head David Simmons as saying in an interview printed on Thursday. Steps to this goal could include "developing new products ourselves, buying licenses or acquiring companies," it said. Generics are copies of drugs that have lost patent protection.
