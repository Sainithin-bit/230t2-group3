 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Ford Motor ( F.N ) priced its $2.95 billion asset-backed securities offering backed by auto loans under the Federal Reserve's new Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facilities on Thursday, market sources said. 

 The automaker's "A1+" rated notes priced at 50 basis points over Libor while its "AAA"-rated one-year notes priced at a spread of 200 basis points over eurodollar swap futures. Both issues were priced in line with initial price guidance, market sources said. Ford's longer-dated maturities were widened to attract investor interest. Its "AAA" two-year notes priced at a 250 basis points spread, compared with earlier guidance of 215-225 basis points, while its 3.31-year notes were  priced at 425 basis points, versus earlier spread guidance of 350-375 basis points, market sources said.
