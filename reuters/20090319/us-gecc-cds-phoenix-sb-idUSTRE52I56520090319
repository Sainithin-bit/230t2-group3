 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The cost of protecting debt of General Electric Co's finance arm against default fell on Thursday after company executives said they expect the unit to be profitable this year. 

 General Electric Capital's five-year credit default swaps tightened to 7.5 percent upfront from 9 percent upfront at Wednesday's close, according to data from Phoenix Partners Group. That means it costs $750,000 in an upfront payment, plus annual premiums of $500,000, to insure $10 million of GE Capital's debt for five years. GE Capital's profit could come to $2 billion to $2.5 billion, though it could post break-even results if the economy deteriorates to the Federal Reserve's adverse case, the company said.
