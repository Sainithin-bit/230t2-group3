 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department on Thursday pledged to provide up to $5 billion in financing support to auto suppliers to help them survive a massive downturn in car sales. 

 The Treasury said the program, run through key participating U.S. auto companies, will provide government guarantees to suppliers to ensure they will receive payment for products shipped, no matter what happens to the recipient car manufacturer. Participating suppliers also will be able to sell receivables into the government program at a modest discount, giving them access to desperately needed liquidity and helping to unlock credit more broadly in the supplier industry, the Treasury said. COMMENTS WILLIAM KOHLER, CO-HEAD OF AUTO PRACTICE AT DETROIT LAW FIRM BUTZEL LONG: "The timing is perfect in that it shouldn't have taken any longer and I'm glad that it didn't. This is a reflection of the distress within the automotive supply base and the government's quick and diligent efforts in understanding the problem." BOB MCKENNA, PRESIDENT OF THE MOTOR AND EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION: "This is the government saying that we're not going to let the domestic auto industry go down and we stand behind it. I'm sure there will be more coming out on GM and Chrysler in the next couple of days." "Our reaction is that this is very positive. It doesn't change the fact that we still need funds but this will lift some of the negatives for the industry and hopefully banks will ease up a little bit." DAVE WHISTON, ANALYST, MORNINGSTAR "It's very good news, and it's something that probably was even overdue because the suppliers and their trade associations have been asking for help for I think over a month now. "I didn't think we really could afford to wait for the auto task force to make their decision on GM and Chrysler at the end of March when those progress reports are due and then also in early April make a decision on the suppliers. We couldn't wait for that, so it's good that they are finally taking some action." AARON BRAGMAN, ANALYST, IHS GLOBAL INSIGHT "So basically, this is loan insurance for receivables, which is one of the things they asked for. My only concern would be, is this enough money? Five billion is significantly less than the $18 (billion) to $25 billion that they'd requested." "It's not as much as I thought we would see. It may be enough to keep things going for a little while, but this is not a sweeping, lasting fix." "Right now, the government is the only game in town in terms of finding money to keep operations going. Wall Street is still frozen despite an influx of nearly $1 trillion so the government is really the only game in town. That is why everyone's going to Washington to try and get money." "This is actually the easiest way to get cash to suppliers, to provide loan insurance on their receivables. This does help the suppliers." "Who will be eligible for it and which suppliers are going to get it, that's going to depend on GM and Chrysler specifically. We don't know if Ford is going to participate as well, but Ford has suppliers that are in just as much trouble." DENNIS VIRAG, PRESIDENT OF AUTOMOTIVE CONSULTING GROUP, ANN ARBOR, MICHIGAN "I think it is welcome news for the supply base and, as with the automakers, it's desperately needed." MIRKO MIKELIC, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, FIFTH THIRD BANK "If they (the government) are going to help out the OEMs (automakers) then they definitely need to help the suppliers. If you look at the big picture, restructuring has to extend beyond the automakers for this to work." "If they (suppliers) start going under it will impact more than just the U.S. Big Three automakers, it will hit the Asian automakers' operations as well." "Auto suppliers are completely reliant on production. Production cuts at the Big Three automakers are going to have a huge impact on cash flow at the suppliers, where margins are already low."
