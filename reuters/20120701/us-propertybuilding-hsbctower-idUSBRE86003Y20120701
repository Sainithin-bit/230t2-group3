 JERUSALEM  (Reuters) - Israel's Property & Building ( PTBL.TA ) said on Sunday it had finalized a deal with JP Morgan ( JPM.N ) to refinance its borrowing on the HSBC Tower in New York in the amount of $400 million over 10 years. 
 The current financing on the Fifth Avenue building is about $240 million. Property & Building, the real estate subsidiary of holding company IDB ( IDBH.TA ), said the new agreement would generate cash flow of about $150 million. It bought the building two years ago for around $350 million. Last month, the company said it had signed a non-binding term sheet with a foreign bank to refinance its borrowing on the building. Property & Building's shares were up 1.5 percent in late morning trade in Tel Aviv. Its bond prices were up 0.6 to 0.7 percent. (Reporting by  Steven Scheer )
