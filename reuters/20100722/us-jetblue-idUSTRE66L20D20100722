 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - JetBlue Airways ( JBLU.O ) boosted quarterly profitability and beat Wall Street expectations on record revenues and expressed optimism on Thursday for the rest of the year. 

 Net income for the second quarter was $30 million, or 10 cents per diluted share, compared with net income of $20 million, or 7 cents per share, in the year-ago period. The profit compares with analysts' expectations of 8 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The airline posted record operating income of $94 million, compared to $76 million in the second quarter of 2009. Stronger revenues also set a record at $939 million. "We are optimistic about the rest of the year," said chief executive Dave Barger, noting that the airline has overcome key challenges associated with the closure of the main runway at New York's Kennedy airport and the implementation of its new customer service and reservation system, Sabre.
