 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Citigroup Inc are among those Obama administration pay czar Kenneth Feinberg will cite for having made "ill-advised" payments, the Wall Street Journal reported on its web site on Thursday. 

 Feinberg is expected to formally criticize compensation practices at the banks on Friday as part of his review of 419 firms that received federal bailout funds. He will cite 17 such firms for making more than $1 billion in ill-advised payments, the Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter. On Wednesday, Feinberg said his report will specifically target some firms, though he declined to say whether bank executives would be asked to pay back some of the year-end bonuses granted at the height of the 2008 financial crisis.
