 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Xerox Corp ( XRX.N ) posted a higher-than-expected second-quarter profit, fueled by demand for printing and outsourcing services, and it boosted its full-year outlook amid optimism following its purchase of ACS. 

 The provider of printing and document management services, whose results offer a peek into the spending behavior of top global corporations, also cited growing demand from developing markets, similar to other companies including Caterpillar ( CAT.N ) and 3M ( MMM.N ) that posted positive results on Thursday. Shares of Xerox, rose 6.4 percent in trading before the market opened, against a backdrop of positive indications in broader markets. Xerox's second-quarter net income rose to $227 million from $140 million a year earlier. On a per-share basis, net profit of 16 cents was even with a year earlier, reflecting a 62 percent increase in shares outstanding. The latest period was the first full quarter that Xerox benefited from its acquisition of Affiliated Computer Services which manages back-office systems and provides technology services. Excluding costs related to restructuring, acquisitions and other special items, the profit was 24 cents a share, beating the analysts' average estimate of 21 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Xerox, whose rivals include Ricoh Co ( 7752.T ) , Oce NV OCEN.AS, Canon Inc ( 7751.T ) and Konica Minolta Holdings ( 4902.T ), said revenue rose 48 percent to $5.5 billion, which matched analysts' forecasts. Equipment sales rose 12 percent. The company's long-term supplies and services contracts that accompany hardware sales represent about 83 percent of total revenue, and noted that signings for Xerox services were up 12 percent in the quarter. Its operating margin was 10.1 percent, up nearly 1 percentage point, driven by improvements in both gross margin and selling and general costs as a percent of revenue. Xerox expects third-quarter earnings per share of 19 cents to 21 cents excluding items, which is on par with Wall Street analysts view of 20 cents a share. For the full-year, the company forecast earnings per share of 88 cents to 92 cents, an increase from its previous outlook of 75 cents to 85 cents a share. The average analyst view is 87 cents a share. Its shares were up 54 cents, or 6.4 percent, at $8.95 in premarket trading. Xerox shares have slipped about 21 percent in the past three months, outpacing a 12 percent decline in the S&P 500 index. The stock, which closed at $8.41 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday, is up only slightly so far this year. (Reporting by  Franklin Paul ; Editing by  Derek Caney )
