 LONDON  (Reuters) - Nokia Chief Executive Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo said speculation about his position was hurting the company and should be brought to an end, but declined to comment further on CNBC TV on Thursday. 

 "There has been a lot of speculation on my position, on myself, during the last couple of weeks and that is not good for Nokia and must be brought to an end one way or another," Kallasvuo said. "At the same time, I'm not in a position here and now to really shed any more light on the topic so I guess this is a no comment. I really concentrate now on the task at hand." Earlier, Nokia reported a sharp drop in second-quarter earnings but forecast a strong fourth quarter for its struggling smartphones business. The Wall Street Journal reported this week that Nokia had begun looking for candidates to replace Kallasvuo, who has struggled to keep up with nimbler rivals Apple and Google.
