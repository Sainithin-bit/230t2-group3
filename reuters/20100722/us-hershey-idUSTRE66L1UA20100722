 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Hershey Co ( HSY.N ) posted a higher-than-expected quarterly profit as increased advertising helped sales, but the U.S. chocolate maker did not increase its full-year earnings forecast, and its shares fell 4 percent. 

 The maker of Hershey's Kisses, Kit Kat bars and Reese's peanut butter cups stood by its 2010 forecast for earnings per share before items and reduced its forecast for net profit, in part because of an impairment charge from the Godrej Hershey Ltd joint venture in India. Hershey also tightened its full-year sales forecast and said it planned to spend more than previously expected on advertising, although it may not see the boost to revenue until next year. "While the reluctance to boost guidance may trouble some investors, we believe the company is taking advantage of the current momentum to get a head start on 2011," said JPMorgan analyst Terry Bivens. Net earnings fell to $46.7 million, or 20 cents per share in the second quarter from $71.3 million, or 31 cents per share, a year earlier. The latest results included charges of 11 cents per share for a supply chain modernization program and 20 cents to write down goodwill for the India venture, which Hershey said has grown more slowly than expected. The company cited slower realization of development plans, increased sugar costs and economic challenges that have delayed the expansion of distribution and the ability to introduce higher-priced candies. Excluding the charges, earnings were 51 cents per share, which topped the analysts' average estimate of 46 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net sales rose 5.3 percent to $1.23 billion, helped by a small benefit from foreign currency exchange rates and some price increases. In the second quarter, the company's advertising expenses increased about 50 percent, partly due to the launch of new products including Hershey's Special Dark, Almond Joy and York Pieces. The company said it was planning additional increases in advertising for the full year and expected those expenses to increase about 45 percent to 50 percent in 2010. It had earlier forecast a rise of 35 percent to 40 percent. Hershey said it still expected adjusted earnings of $2.47 to $2.52 per share for 2010, with net income of $2.04 to $2.12. Its net sales are expected to rise about 7 percent. Last month, Hershey forecast 2010 net income of $2.31 to $2.38 per share on a net sales increase of 6 percent to 7 percent. Hershey shares were down $2.02, or 4 percent, at $47.80 in morning trading. (Reporting by Martinne Geller, editing by Maureen Bavdek and Lisa Von Ahn)
