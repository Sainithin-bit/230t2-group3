 LONDON  (Reuters) - Paulson & Co, the hedge fund linked to civil fraud charges against Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ), will launch a new fund open to retail investors, the Financial Times said on Thursday. 

 Citing people familiar with the move, the newspaper said the fund will launch later this year in conjunction with Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ). The fund will track the firms existing investment strategies, the FT said, adding that it will be domiciled onshore in Europe and use the Ucits structure. Paulson and Deutsche Bank could not immediately be reached for comment. (Reporting by Karolina Tagaris; editing by  Lincoln Feast )
