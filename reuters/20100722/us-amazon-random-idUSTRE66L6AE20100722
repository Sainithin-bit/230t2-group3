 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Book publisher Random House said on Thursday it disagreed with a new deal between online retailer Amazon.com and literary agent Andrew Wylie to publish 20 classic book titles from authors such as Philip Roth and John Updike. 

 Amazon.com Inc and The Wylie Agency announced late on Wednesday a landmark deal that would exclusively publish digital editions of 20 backlist titles owned by Wylie for the first time on its Kindle electronic reader. But in another sign of the turmoil of the nascent e-books market that has spawned disputes between traditional book publishers and authors over e-book rights, Random House publicly hit back at the deal, issuing a statement on Thursday saying it had stopped dealing with Wylie. The Wylie deal to sell "titles which are subject to active Random House agreements undermines our long-standing commitments to and investments in our authors, and it establishes this Agency as our direct competitor," Random House spokesman Stuart Applebaum said in a statement. "Therefore, regrettably, Random House on a worldwide basis will not be entering into any new English-language business agreements with the Wylie Agency until this situation is resolved." Random House owned the rights to produce in print many of the titles under the deal. Books such as "Lolita" by Vladimir Nabokov and "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" by Hunter S. Thompson and Philip Roth's "Portnoy's Complaint" have never been published in an e-book format. Many traditional publishers claim they own the digital rights to backlist titles, in part because they say they spend money on nurturing and marketing an author as well as printing costs, while authors and deceased authors estates say their old or existing contracts do not cover the digital rights for e-books. Amazon's and Wylie's move comes as competition intensifies in the crowded digital book market, including Apple Inc's iPad and Barnes & Noble Inc's Nook e-reader. The Wylie deal may increase the race among the makers of electronic readers to buy digital rights to other classic books that will help them win more customers or spark traditional publishers to intensify their claim to the digital rights. This is the first time books such as "Ficciones" by late Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges will be available electronically, Amazon said. All of the books are exclusive to the Kindle Store for two years. Kindle customers can download these books for $9.99.
