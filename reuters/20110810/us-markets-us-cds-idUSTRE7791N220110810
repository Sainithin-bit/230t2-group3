 LONDON  (Reuters) - The cost of insuring U.S. government debt against default fell on Wednesday after the U.S. Federal Reserve signaled it would maintain an ultra-easy monetary policy for at least two more years. 

 U.S. CDS fell 4 basis points to 53 bps, according to Markit data. The Fed on Tuesday promised to keep interest rates near zero until 2013 and said it would consider further steps to help growth -- fueling speculation it could do another bout of quantitative easing.
