 DETROIT  (Reuters) - The company named for television host and lifestyle guru Martha Stewart has been sued for violating a patent for a mattress cover to protect against bedbugs, which have become a huge problem in some U.S. cities. 

 JAB Distributors in Northbrook, Illinois, charged Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc with violating the patent it received last year for the mattress protector and is seeking unspecified damages and attorney fees, according to the lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court in Chicago. JAB also is asking the federal court for an injunction to prevent further patent infringement, according to court documents filed on Thursday. Officials with Martha Stewart Living said in a statement that they were currently investigating the matter but declined further comment. A number of U.S. cities, including New York, have experienced bedbug outbreaks in recent months. The parasites, which prefer to feed on human blood, can live in furniture, bedding and in holes in walls and can travel in luggage and clothing. JAB sells its mattress cover products under the "Protect-A-Bed" brand, while Martha Stewart Living sells its product under the name "Martha Stewart Collection Allergy Wise Mattress Protector," according to court documents. JAB has asked for a trial by jury, according to court documents. The case is JAB Distributors LLC v. Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois, No. 10-05716. (Reporting by  Ben Klayman ; Editing by Paul Simao)
