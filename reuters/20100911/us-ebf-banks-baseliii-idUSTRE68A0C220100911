 MILAN  (Reuters) - Basel III banking regulations have to be balanced or they might endanger economic growth in Europe, the European Banking Federation's (EBF) head said in a letter published by Italian newspapers on Saturday. 

 "EBF members are very concerned about the effect that (new regulations) may have on banks' lending," Unicredit's Chief Executive Alessandro Profumo said in the letter to European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet. "At this point, a well-balanced calibration of the proposals...will be crucial if we are not to put European jobs and growth at risk," Profumo said, according to excerpts in Italy's Il Sole 24 Ore and Corriere della Sera. EBF was not immediately reachable for comment. Top banking executives have voiced concerns that harsh global capital rules for banks to be unveiled this weekend could limit lending and cut growth across Europe. Negotiators are set to meet Sunday in the Swiss town of Basel to agree on the new bank capital and liquidity requirements -- dubbed Basel III -- to avoid another financial crisis. Leaders of the Group of 20 countries are expected to adopt the new standards at a meeting in November. (Reporting by  Antonella Ciancio , Editing by Jonathan Thatcher)
