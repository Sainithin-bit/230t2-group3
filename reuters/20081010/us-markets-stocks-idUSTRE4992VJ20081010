 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Stocks slumped at the open on Friday, with the benchmark S&P 500 falling below the 900 mark, as fears that tighter credit may send the global economy into recession slashed the appetite for risk. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  slid 401.27 points, or 4.68 percent, to 8,177.92. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was down 6.43 percent, or 58.48 points, at 851.44. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was down 69.09 points, or 4.20 percent, at 1,576.03. (Editing by  James Dalgleish )
