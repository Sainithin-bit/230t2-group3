 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Short interest fell sharply on the Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchanges in late September, reflecting the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ban on the short selling of financial stocks, which affected the trading of about 950 stocks. 

 Short interest fell 10 percent on the Nasdaq from mid-September to late September, and on the New York Stock Exchange, dropped 13.4 percent during that period to their lowest levels since February. "The short sellers have heard the SEC and are looking to lessen their exposure in the market," said Dylan Wetherill, president and founder of short interest tracking Website ShortSqueeze.com. In September, the SEC imposed a temporary, emergency ban on the short selling of 799 financial stocks, a list which grew to include non-financial companies such as General Electric Co and drug store chain CVS Caremark Corp, in an attempt to stem the dizzying drops in the prices of shares of financial stocks. The ban expired on Wednesday. Investors who sell securities "short" profit from betting stocks will fall. Short-sellers borrow shares and then sell them, waiting for the price to fall so they can buy them back for less, return them to the lender and pocket the difference. Short interest on the Nasdaq, or the average number of days it would take to cover the outstanding short positions, decreased to 3.24 days as of September 30, from 5.22 days in mid September. At the NYSE, short interest was equal to 3.88 percent of shares outstanding. With the ban on short selling ending, the question arises as to whether short interest will increase again. "Most short sellers are keeping their powder dry," said Harry Strunk, principal at Treflie Capital Management in New York. "Most short sellers will be cautious, because they might ask themselves how much more downside does the market still have?" Wetherhill, for one, welcomes the return of short selling. "Short sellers assist investors in finding stocks that have fundamental problems, often times caused by the leadership of a company," he said. "Recently, leadership of companies in trouble have been looking to blame other people." Among the stocks with the largest increases in short positions on both exchanges were non-financial stocks such as Sprint Nextel Corp, fast food chain Wendy's/Arby's Group, Boston Scientific Corp and Ericsson. A number of financial stocks were among those that saw the largest drops in short positions, such as E*Trade Financial Corp, Wachovia Corp and Citigroup. About 14.838 billion shares were held short on the NYSE as of Sept 30, down from 17.138 as of Sept 15. On the Nasdaq, short interest fell to 9.062 billion in late September from 10.071 billion as of Sept 15.
