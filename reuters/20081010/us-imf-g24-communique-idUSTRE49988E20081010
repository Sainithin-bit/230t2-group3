 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Ministers of the Group of 24 emerging and developing nations called for a comprehensive response to address the global market strain and restore market confidence. 

 The continued strained financial conditions "will dampen global growth," the ministers said in a statement, as finance ministers and central bankers of the Group of Seven nations held a meeting in Washington. The G24 group said developing countries are resilient so far but it was worried about financial contagion spreading.
