 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc are not in talks to renegotiate their deal for a $9 billion investment by Japan's top bank in the U.S. company, a source familiar with the matter said on Friday. 

 Morgan Stanley has received all regulatory approvals for the investment by MUFG, which is expected to close on Tuesday, the source said. (Reporting by  Paritosh Bansal ; editing by Carol Bishopric)
