 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - General Electric Co reported a 22 percent drop in third-quarter net income that matched its recently cut forecast as the global credit crunch hurt its hefty GE Capital arm, offsetting strong demand for electricity-generating turbines and jet engines. 

 The U.S. conglomerate posted earnings of $4.31 billion, or 43 cents per diluted share, down from $5.56 billion, or 54 cents per diluted share, a year earlier. Profit from continuing operations came to 45 cents per share, matching the average Wall Street estimate as compiled by Reuters Estimates. On that basis, GE late last month cut its outlook to between 43 cents and 48 cents per share from a previous range of 50 cents to 54 cents. Revenue rose 11.1 percent. GE shares were down about 2 percent in pre-market trading on Friday after closing at $19.01 on the NYSE on Thursday. The following are comments on the results: DANIEL HOLLAND, ANALYST AT MORNINGSTAR IN CHICAGO: "It was aiming for 43 cents to 48 cents a share and they got that. There are a couple of questions about margins, especially with the consumer and industrial segment. There was a 6 percent revenue drop in that segment. "On the positive side, in infrastructure and business, growth there has held up exceptionally well. People think infrastructure would be hurt by credit problems, but it hasn't been. The backlog is actually stronger than last year, which makes you think it'll hold up for some time. "When you look at the financial services sector, it's not the best place to be doing business. The fact that GE is able to generate $2 billion in profit is not the best of things, but it's not the worst of things either. "I have no clue how the results will affect the market, but everything we thought would help hasn't, so I don't see how GE doing what it was expected to do would help. "What the results show is that the wheels are not off the bus. What was priced into the market was that the wheels were falling off." CHRIS HOSSAIN, SENIOR SALES MANAGER, ODL SECURITIES. LONDON "In desperate times, investors are looking for anything to grab hold of. Albeit the numbers were lowered in advance, meeting expectations should be deemed to be a lifeline. "These results may prove a catalyst for steadying the dramatic market declines." BRIAN LANGENBERG, PRINCIPAL, LANGENBERG & CO., RIVER FOREST, ILLINOIS "They're just as bad as they said they were going to (be), but no worse and I think that's key. I think psychologically in any part of the investment world is that the deterioration is accelerating -- and this was bad but no worse than they said was going to happen. "They came through where they said the third quarter would come through. "The sigh of relief is going to last about 5 minutes. It's still about what's going on in the world and the fact they have a lot of finance. "Bank stocks were already decimated and now the insurance stocks are starting to cave, and even though these guys aren't insurance anymore if you have a lot of finance that hurts you. "On the industrial side, whether it be Manitowoc or ABB, companies that are levered to the global infrastructure build are just getting hammered by 5 and 10 percent a day. "Even though (GE said) infrastructure grew, nobody cares. The stocks are getting hammered not on what people think happened in the third quarter but on what they think is happening now and how that translates into next year." "I think Jeff (Immelt) is a heck of a CEO and the company will get through this period. But when markets are working against you, that doesn't mean results are going to be that good." PETER SORRENTINO, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AND PORTFOLIO MANAGER, HUNTINGTON ASSET ADVISORS, CINCINNATI: "At first blush, it looks fine. They guided, they matched guidance ... I was hoping infrastructure results were going to come through stronger than this. "My estimate was a penny higher than this. I though with the falloff in commodity prices in the quarter that they'd generate a little bit better margin." "There's not a lot of warm comfort here but it's a good report. "There was nothing horrific on the finance side. This stock should bounce if there is any fairness in the world."
