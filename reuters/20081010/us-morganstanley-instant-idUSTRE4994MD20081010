 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares in Morgan Stanley tumbled more than 30 percent in premarket trading on Friday as some investors remained unconvinced about its deal with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc and after one two analyst reports cited concerns about its earnings outlook. 

 The following are reactions from industry analysts and investors: MARINO MARIN, MANAGING DIRECTOR AND BANKER AT GRUPPO, LEVEY & CO, A BOUTIQUE INVESTMENT BANK IN NEW YORK "It's not just Morgan Stanley. I predicted that if Lehman went down it would be disastrous, and it has been. Lehman has caused fear that financial institutions can go down, so there's a tremendous lack of confidence in the system. "The fear is mainly due to the fact that this happened once before and could happen again -- a bank went down, and others could too. This overall environment isn't helping. The government has announced plans but hasn't actually done anything. "The U.S. government should emulate Italy, the UK and Ireland and others and back the banks. Immediate U.S. government action is paramount -- not just announcements, but action. Nationalization could happen, and it might very well happen. This is becoming very, very bad. This is worse than a horror movie." ROBBERT VAN BATENBURG, HEAD OF RESEARCH AT LOUIS CAPITAL, NY "It's a situation that is outside their control ... the bottom line in this type of business is that it's based on trust and when your clients do not have any trust anymore in the sustainability of your company as an ongoing concern, they're going to pull their business away from you. "It's that sad." KEN CRAWFORD, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER OF ARGENT CAPITAL MANAGEMENT IN ST LOUIS, MISSOURI "The ratings might be cut and if you look at the credit default swaps are kind of blowing out, so I would imagine investors think that there could be some credit event in the horizon. "Perhaps (the concerns are) that they need capital and their inability to secure that capital. We've seen the story before with Lehman and AIG. Maybe Morgan Stanley is the next company to be on the ropes or in deep, deep trouble. "The markets are saying that even with that capital (from Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group) they are uncomfortable with Morgan Stanley's capital position." JON FISHER, PORTFOLIO MANAGER AT FIFTH THIRD ASSET MANAGEMENT IN MINNEAPOLIS "A Moody's threat of a downgrade is terrible. "The Mitsubishi transaction hasn't closed yet ... I think there's a legitimate concern that that deal doesn't go through. "Once (the Moody's announcement) hit last night, people jumped to the Lehman Brothers parallel. "In this environment ... it doesn't matter the numbers, it doesn't matter the reputation, it doesn't matter the name on the door. The fact of the matter is we had five Wall Street firms, three are down, one is hanging by a thread. "It simply comes down to the deal (with Mitsubishi). The deal has to close, the financing has to close for them to even have a chance." (Reporting by  Dan Wilchins ,  Elinor Comlay ,  Juan Lagorio  and  Martinne Geller )
