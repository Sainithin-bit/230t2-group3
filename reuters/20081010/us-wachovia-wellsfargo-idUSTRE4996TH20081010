 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Wells Fargo ( WFC.N ) has received U.S. antitrust approval to acquire Wachovia Corp WB.N, government officials said on Friday. 

 Antitrust authorities completed their review of the deal, now worth about $12 billion, without taking any action to block it, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission said in a notice. On Thursday, Citigroup ( C.N ) walked away from a brief but acrimonious battle with Wells Fargo over Wachovia and vowed to pursue up to $60 billion in legal claims. Citi agreed to buy Wachovia's banking assets for about $2.2 billion with partial government assistance, but a few days later, Wells Fargo signed an agreement to buy all of Wachovia.
