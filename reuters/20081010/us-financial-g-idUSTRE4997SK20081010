 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Finance leaders from the world's rich nations pledged a coordinated response to the credit crisis on Friday but stopped short of backing a British plan to guarantee lending between banks. 

 Faced with the threat of a global recession and panicky financial markets, Group of Seven members acknowledged that they could no longer afford a country-by-country, case-by-case approach to crisis management after 14 months of turmoil. Recapitalizing banks was a top priority as the United States, Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan met on Friday afternoon, though there was much disagreement about how best to do that. The U.S. Treasury Department has a $700 billion rescue plan in hand, which it could tap to buy stakes in banks. European leaders have yet to unite behind a similar proposal. The G7 are expected to issue a communique summing up their views sometime after 6 p.m., but heading into the afternoon meeting there was little consensus on what they might say. The International Monetary Fund has estimated losses from the credit crisis could reach $1.4 trillion, or about double what banks have written down so far. That would leave a gaping hole on balance sheets and restrict already tight lending. "We should not imagine that we will have a harmonized response that will be the same for everyone, quite simply because you cannot apply the same method to market situations that are different," French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde said. "What is important is to reach an agreement on common principles." But Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, Alistair Darling, said governments needed to "move on from simply agreeing on a general approach." "Markets and people the world over will be looking for a clear sign that governments of the largest economies in particular are prepared to act -- they are prepared to take firm measures that will make a difference," Darling told Reuters in an interview. "We expect this weekend to show that we are determined to do that. Britain this week committed 50 billion pounds to recapitalize its banks and offered to guarantee interbank lending by as much as 250 billion pounds to get credit flowing again. Darling said he hoped other countries would follow Britain's plan. Officials from two G7 countries said the group was unlikely to adopt the British approach this weekend. "We will have to coordinate internationally, but beyond that there should be room for nation-specific solutions," German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck said. "What Great Britain has been doing is one approach, but that does not mean that it should be transferred to any other country." (Reporting by Reuters' G7 team; Writing by  Emily Kaiser )
