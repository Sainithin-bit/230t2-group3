 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Tokyo shares headed for their biggest one-day fall since the 1987 market crash on Friday as the global financial crisis claimed its first Japanese financial institution and the government looked to prop up smaller banks. 

 Escalating bankruptcies in the property sector and among small businesses, along with fears of a global recession, have dragged Japan's export-dependent economy into the crisis, sending blue chip shares sliding by a quarter so far this week. ************************************************************* KEY POINTS: -- The Nikkei share average fell 11 percent at one point. It has fallen by about a quarter this week. -- The yen hit a three-year high against the euro and a six-month high against the dollar. -- Japan's Yamato Life Insurance Co, an unlisted insurer, failed with $2.7 billion in debt, although government ministers and analysts were quick to play down the risk of contagion. COMMENTARY YASUNARI UENO, CHIEF MARKET ECONOMIST, MIZUHO SECURITIES "The series of media reports so far about what the U.S. authorities may do (on the financial crisis) have reduced the surprise factor, compromising the effectiveness of their moves. "Whether it is the U.S. president's statement or a joint message with the G7, simply giving out a statement is unlikely to support stock prices for anything more than a few days. "If the authorities' move turns out to be deemed extensive enough, investors may come back to buy shares. "The feeling of doubt is so strong among market participants that market sentiment is unlikely to improve until the authorities do what they commit to do and tangible results begin to show." KAZUHITO UCHIDA, CHIEF ECONOMIST, BANK OF TOKYO MITSUBISHI UFJ "As the credit crunch is now beginning to threaten the yen short-term money markets and dry up liquidity, the Bank of Japan should play a bigger role as the lender of last resort. "And to enhance the function of the lender of last resort, the BOJ should consider paying interest rates on reserve deposits that financial institutions put up at the central bank and accepting foreign currency-denominated assets as collateral for its yen supplying operations." "But the BOJ probably does not have to cut interest rates, given the limited impact that such a policy call can have on the liquidity problem." "Since there is no quick fix that can stem tumbling share prices, there is no other way for central banks but to do what they can do within their power and see how their action will affect the markets." TAKAHIDE KIUCHI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, NOMURA SECURITIES "Global financial turmoil is having a direct impact on Japan as you can see from the failures of a Japanese REIT and an insurance firm. Western financial institutions pulled the trigger, but Japanese financial systems will be affected through stock falls. "Japanese financial institutions have massive stockholdings, so a plunge in share prices will tighten their financial conditions and prompt them to curb lending. "If the United States unveils concrete steps to inject public funds into financial institutions at the G7 meeting, the situation will calm down next week. But financial markets will remain weak at least until next year when the next president takes office to come up with a drastic solution." HIROAKI OSAKABE, FUND MANAGER, CHIBAGIN ASSET MANAGEMENT "The Nikkei has lost close to 20 percent in three days alone, and it's certainly not as if economic fundamentals have worsened that much in that time period. "It's basically all psychological. And it's not going to stop until fears about the financial system have been erased." YOSHINORI NAGANO, CHIEF STRATEGIST, DAIWA ASSET MANAGEMENT "No one is buying. Fundamentals don't matter any more and there's no explanation for such a plunge. "Fears about the U.S. financial system have been rekindled. The U.S. government is still debating whether it will inject money into financial institutions. It needs to act now even if that would be beyond the current law." TAKASHI USHIO, HEAD OF INVESTMENT STRATEGY, MARUSAN SECURITIES "This is panic. New York, the currencies -- there's nothing left for us to trust. "Investors are scurrying to convert to cash. A lack of confidence is coupling with panic. "Paulson will have to definitely promise the injection of public funds, and then he'll have to make the timing of this very clear. He needs to also make it very clear that he'll do it as soon as possible. "If he doesn't show a really strong stance nothing will stop." TSUYOSHI SEGAWA, EQUITY STRATEGIST, SHINKO SECURITIES "On top of a tumble in U.S. stocks, we have domestic credit fears today. The news about Yamato Life came as rather a surprise and that is fuelling more fear." (Compiled by Tokyo Editing Desk)
