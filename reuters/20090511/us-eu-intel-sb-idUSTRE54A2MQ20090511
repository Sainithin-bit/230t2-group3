 (Reuters) - The European Commission is set to rule on Wednesday that Intel, the world's largest microchip maker, illegally paid computer manufacturers to restrict their use of chips made by rival AMD. 

 The Commission, tasked with ensuring companies do not abuse any market dominance or set agreements that restrict competition in the 27-country European Union, is expected to fine Intel and order a halt to some of its rebates. U.S.-based Intel's central processing units power four out of five of the world's 1 billion personal computers and servers. Here are the key events in Intel's antitrust battle with the Brussels-based Commission. 2001 - The Commission launches an investigation into an AMD complaint that Intel used unfair business practices to persuade companies to buy its microprocessors. July 2007 - The Commission accuses Intel of abusing its dominant position with marketing and pricing practices that infringe EU laws. January 2008 - Intel responds to the charge sheet, known as a "statement of objections." February 2008 - The Commission inspects documents at Intel's Feldkirchen office in Germany. March 2008 - Intel responds orally to the charges at a hearing held by the EU executive. July 2008 - The Commission sends a supplementary statement of objections to Intel, accusing it of giving rebates to a major European PC retailer on condition that the firm sell only Intel-based PCs. The EU executive also files two other charges related to computer makers. October 2008 - Intel files an appeal with the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg, asking the EU's second-highest court to overrule decisions by the Commission which it says limit the evidence available to the company to conduct its defense. January 2009 - The court rejects Intel's appeal. February 2009 - Intel responds to the Commission's supplementary statement of objections. March 2009 - The Commission asks Intel for information on its global and European revenues. April 2009 - Intel provides the revenue details. (Reporting by  Foo Yun Chee )
