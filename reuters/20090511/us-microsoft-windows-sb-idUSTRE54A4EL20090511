 SEATTLE  (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp ( MSFT.O ) is on track to release its new Windows 7 operating system in time for the holiday shopping season, an executive said on Monday, confirming talk that it is ahead of its own conservative schedule for replacing the unpopular Vista system. 

 The world's largest software company has so far been vague on specifying the timing of its new operating system, wary of disappointing customers. But it has broadly targeted the end of this year or the beginning of next year. "Windows 7 is tracking well for holiday availability," Bill Veghte, senior vice president of Microsoft's Windows business said at an event on Monday, citing good test results on the early version of the system released to developers and the public over the past few weeks. Last month, Microsoft said Windows 7 was on track for launch in its fiscal year 2010, which could mean as early as July this year. That inspired some hopes that Microsoft would be able to take advantage of both the back-to-school and holiday shopping seasons, which usually bring a spike in computer purchases and accompanying software. Over the last few weeks, Microsoft has been releasing an early version of Windows 7, known as a 'release candidate', to developers and the public. Once it makes some more adjustments to the software, the next stage is for Microsoft to release the system to PC manufacturers to install on machines that will be sold in shops. Microsoft's operating systems, installed on the vast majority of the world's PCs, are still the backbone of the company, providing more than half of its $4.4 billion profit last quarter. The disappointing Vista, launched to the public in 2007, was incompatible with some low-power machines and perceived by many to be too complicated.
