 (Reuters) - Following are the capital needs of 10 big U.S. banks, based on regulatory "stress tests" using a hypothetical scenario that assumed a deepening recession. 

 The results, released by the U.S. Treasury Department and top banking regulators, showed a combined capital shortfall of $74.6 billion for the group. Each bank must submit a capital-raising plan by June 8, and then has until November 9 to implement it. The stress tests also found 9 other big U.S. banks were adequately capitalized.
