 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ) critic group WakeUpWalMart.com said on Thursday that it and other labor-rights groups have filed an official complaint asking the U.S. Federal Election Commission to investigative possible unlawful election activity at Wal-Mart. 

 In the complaint, WakeUpWalMart.com said it asks the FEC to "immediately open an investigation to determine whether a violation occurred and, if so, to take all appropriate steps to remedy that violation of federal election law." (Reporting by  Nicole Maestri , editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
