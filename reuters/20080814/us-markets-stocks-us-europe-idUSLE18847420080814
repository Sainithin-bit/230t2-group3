 London  (Reuters) - Stock futures point to a higher opening on Wall Street on Thursday, reversing some of the previous session's losses while investors await for key inflation data, as well as earnings from Wal-Mart Stores ( WMT.N ), the world's biggest retailer. 

 By 0905 GMT, S&P 500 futures were up 0.24 percent, the Dow Jones futures were up 0.29 percent and the Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.19 percent. Economic indicators on tap for Thursday include weekly jobless claims and Consumer Price Index data, due at 1230 GMT. Analysts expect the CPI to show a still-steep rise of 0.4 percent in July after a 1.1 percent jump in June, according to the median forecast of 83 economists polled by Reuters. Earnings reports on Thursday include JC Penney Co ( JCP.N ), Kohl's Corp ( KSS.N ) and Wal-Mart Stores ( WMT.N ). The results will provide another indication of how consumers used their tax rebate checks. Wal-Mart is expected to report a higher second-quarter profit as cash-strapped shoppers have been flocking to the retailer in search of discounts on food, household items and electronics. Steelmakers will be in the spotlight after Germany's ThyssenKrupp ( TKAG.DE ) and Salzgitter ( SZGG.DE ) raised their profit forecasts on Thursday as they cashed in on growth in developing economies such as China, India and Russia. Brewer InBev INTB.BR hopes to sign senior banks into the $45 billion loan backing its acquisition of Anheuser-Busch ( BUD.N ) next week, its chief executive said on Thursday. Barnes & Noble Inc ( BKS.N ), the largest U.S. specialty bookseller, is unlikely to make a bid for rival Borders Group Inc BGP.N, The Wall Street Journal said, citing people familiar with the situation.
