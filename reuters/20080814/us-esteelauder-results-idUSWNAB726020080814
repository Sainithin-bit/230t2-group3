 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. cosmetics company Estee Lauder Cos Inc ( EL.N ) posted higher quarterly profit on Thursday, helped by higher sales across all categories and the weak U.S. dollar. 

 Net income increased to $120.2 million, or 61 cents a share, in its fiscal fourth quarter ended June 30, from $88.6 million, or 45 cents a share, a year earlier. New York-based Estee Lauder, whose brands include MAC, Clinique, Aveda and Bobbi Brown, has felt a lingering effect from Macy's Inc's ( M.N ) acquisition of May Department stores, which left it with fewer stores in which to sell its products.
