 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ) and Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) are close to settling with government regulators to buy back auction-rate debt from clients, Bloomberg News said on Thursday, citing people briefed on the negotiations. 

 Wachovia Corp WB.N is also nearing a deal, Bloomberg said, citing Laura Egerdal, a spokeswoman for Missouri Secretary of State Robin Carnahan, who is in the negotiations. The agency quoted Egerdal as saying that negotiations between a multistate task force and Wachovia "made great progress" over the weekend, but that there were a few more things to be worked out, which were still being discussed. On Wednesday, Texas Securities Commissioner Denise Voigt Crawford said U.S. and state regulators were close to settling with several banks accused of mishandling sales of auction-rate debt to individuals and institutions. New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, one of the most aggressive regulators pursuing the issue, on Monday told JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Wachovia that it wants to begin settlement talks immediately. JPMorgan was the third-largest auction-rate municipal bond underwriter since 2000 after Citigroup Inc ( C.N ) and UBS AG ( UBSN.VX ), according to ThomsonReuters data, while Morgan Stanley was the fourth. New York, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other states announced settlements last week with Citigroup and UBS. Combined, the banks agreed to pay $250 million in fines and repurchase about $27 billion of the debt from their clients. Merrill Lynch & Co Inc MER.N is still negotiating a settlement with Massachusetts, but there are no imminent agreements at this point, Bloomberg said, citing Massachusetts Secretary of State spokesman William Galvin. Last week, Merrill offered for a one-year period beginning January 15, 2009 to buy back auction-rate debt it sold to retail clients. Merrill estimated that its clients hold $12 billion of the debt. Neither Cuomo's office, nor representatives at JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Merrill and Wachovia immediately returned calls seeking comment.
