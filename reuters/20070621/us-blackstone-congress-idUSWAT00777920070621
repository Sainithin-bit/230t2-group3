 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform urged the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday to delay Blackstone Group LP's BG.UL initial public offering until Congress has had a chance to hold hearings on the matter. 

 In a letter to SEC Chairman Christopher Cox, California Democrat Henry Waxman said Blackstone's IPO may present potential investors and the public with new and undisclosed risks, while stripping them of necessary protections. "For this reason, we urge you to refrain from accelerating the IPO until Congress has had a chance to hold hearings on this matter," wrote Waxman. The letter was also signed by Rep. Dennis Kucinich, an Ohio Democrat and chairman of the panel's domestic policy subcommittee. Blackstone's public offering, the biggest U.S. IPO in five years, is expected to be priced later on Thursday and could start trading as early as Friday. The SEC declined to comment on the Waxman letter, remaining silent even as lawmakers have turned up the heat on the investor protection agency over the Blackstone IPO. Blackstone also declined to comment. Experts said that under securities law, the SEC can only deny an issuer's IPO registration statement because of a material misstatement or an omission of fact. Waxman is the fifth congressional chairman to raise concerns or questions about the Blackstone IPO in the past week. The Democratic and Republican leaders of the Senate Finance Committee have proposed legislation to sharply raise the tax rate on private equity funds that go public. The chairmen of the House Financial Services Committee, the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Banking Committee have also expressed concerns or questions about Blackstone and private equity funds going public. In the letter, Waxman said the value of investors' interests in Blackstone would be tied to the performance of its underlying hedge and private equity funds. Such funds have not been considered suitable investments for the general public because of their high risks and speculative nature, he said. "While exposing unsophisticated investors to new risks, the Blackstone IPO would also apparently deprive them of control over the management of the funds and of many of the protections provided by fiduciary duties typically owed to them by management," Waxman and Kucinich wrote. The two lawmakers said they would hold a hearing on the issues at the "earliest opportunity." The AFL-CIO labor federation has also pressed the SEC to force Blackstone to re-register its IPO under the Investment Company Act, which would require it to disclose more information.
