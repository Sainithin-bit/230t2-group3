 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve is expected to nod to signs of easing inflation when policy-makers meet next week, but with signs U.S. economic growth is reviving, inflation looks set to remain its main concern. 

 The U.S. central bank's Federal Open Market Committee is widely anticipated to leave its target for benchmark overnight interest rates unchanged at 5.25 percent at a two-day meeting that wraps up on June 28. The Fed has held overnight rates, which influence a wide array of borrowing costs throughout the economy, steady since June of last year as it patiently waited for inflation to ebb. While prices outside of food and energy are moving up more slowly now, the economy seems to be weathering a sharp housing market downturn well and the labor market remains tight, making it hard for officials to set aside inflation worries. Economists said it is likely the Fed will make only minor tweaks to its post-meeting statement. "Since the policy outlook really hasn't changed much, except for the fact that their confidence level in their forecast has probably edged up some from May, they'll put a premium in maintaining as much stability in the language as they can," said Lou Crandall, chief economist for Wrightson ICAP in Jersey City, New Jersey. The Fed may also be reluctant to make changes to its statement before seeing revisions to economic data due over the summer, Crandall added. When Fed officials last met on May 9, they described core inflation, which sets volatile food and energy prices aside, as "somewhat elevated." Since then, key price gauges have moderated. Although the overall Consumer Price Index was up sharply in May, core prices rose just 0.1 percent. In fact, the core CPI in May stood just 2.2 percent above its year-ago level, the smallest gain since March 2006 Similarly, the Fed's favorite inflation indicator of the Fed's, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, showed a 2 percent year-on-year rise in April, the smallest in more than a year. Some Fed officials say they prefer to see this price gauge between 1 percent and 2 percent. While policy-makers may no longer describe core inflation as elevated, they need to see unemployment edge higher or a string of lower inflation data before relaxing, said Jim O'Sullivan, an economist with UBS in New York. "We're not there yet," he said. Similarly, reports have pointed to a rebound in output from the sluggish first quarter, when the economy grew at a sluggish 0.6 percent annual rate. Employers added 157,000 new jobs in May on a surge in hiring by the services sector. The service sector grew at its fastest pace in a year in May, an Institute of Supply Management report showed. In addition, retail sales in May posted their biggest gain since January as consumers shrugged off higher gasoline prices. The Fed's Beige Book described economic activity around the country expanding from mid-April through May, with gains in consumer spending, retail sales, and in most regions, manufacturing. However, in addition to keeping watch on a tight labor market for any sign of inflation, the Fed will continue to monitor closely the drag the protracted correction in the housing market has caused on economic growth. "This is not a picture that induces them to shift their view in any way," said Peter Hooper, chief economist for Deutsche Bank Securities in New York. The recent rise in bond yields may extend the slow recovery of the housing market, Hooper said. The Fed is also due to discuss its report to Congress on the economy and the outlook, expected in July, and possible changes to the way it communicates with markets and the public over the course of its two-day meeting.
