 (Reuters) - Home decor retailer Pier 1 Imports Inc. ( PIR.N ) on Thursday said its quarterly loss more than doubled amid tepid sales and expects to close more stores than previously planned as it strives to return to profitability. 

 In a regulatory filing on Thursday, the company said it expects to close 100 stores rather than the 60 it had previously planned and cut some more jobs. The company did not specify how many jobs it planned to cut. Related to these actions, it sees additional expenses of about $10 million beginning in the second quarter but mainly in the third quarter. For the first quarter, net loss widened to $56.4 million, or 64 cents a share, from $23.2 million, or 27 cents a year ago. Quarterly results were also hurt by a one-time charge of $3.5 million related to previously announced job cuts, the company said in a statement. Analysts, on average, had expected a loss of 33 cents per share, excluding items, according to Reuters Estimates. Pier 1, which is known for its wicker furniture and ethnic decorations, said quarterly sales fell 5.2 percent to $356.4 million. Wall Street analysts expected $353.4 million in sales. The retailer, which has been battered in recent quarters by competition from Target Co. ( TGT.N ) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ), has now posted nine straight quarterly losses. New products, like modernized furniture selections and home fashions like curtains and glassware have failed to entice its once loyal shoppers. In order to get back to profitability, the company has cut jobs, announced plans to close stores and has vowed to spend significantly less on marketing after pouring millions last year in futile efforts to boost customer traffic.
