 SEOUL  (Reuters) - U.S. equity fund Lone Star LS.UL is selling part of its two-thirds stake in Korea Exchange Bank (KEB) 004940.KS in a block trade to raise up to $1.08 billion, sources familiar with the deal said on Thursday. 

 The sale not only enables Lone Star, facing a legal battle over KEB, to cash in some investment gains but could also help find a buyer for its controlling stake more easily in the future, analysts said. Lone Star saw its $7.3 billion agreement to sell KEB to the country's biggest lender, Kookmin Bank 060000.KS, aborted in November last year due to a legal dispute over its $1.2 billion purchase of KEB in 2003. The Dallas-based fund is offering 73.09 million shares in KEB, or an 11.3 percent stake, at between 13,150 won and 13,750 won ($14.18-$14.83) per share, said a source, who declined to be named. The price represents a discount of 6 to 10 percent from Thursday's closing price of 14,600 won. The final pricing is expected before the Seoul market's open on Friday. After the block deal, Lone Star will not sell its remaining 53.3 percent stake within the next six months, another source close to the deal said. Credit Suisse ( CSGN.VX ) is the sole bookrunner for the deal. "Lone Star will be able to maximise M&A premium on KEB as the fund will still own a controlling stake even after the sale," said Kim Jae-woo, an analyst at Samsung Securities. Officials at Lone Star could not be reached for comment immediately. KEB is the country's fifth-largest bank and one of the few remaining targets for foreign investors seeking growth in South Korea's banking sector. "There are still many banks which are interested in KEB," said Kim. DBS Group Holdings ( DBSM.SI ), Southeast Asia's largest bank, had had talks with Lone Star to buy KEB but pulled out earlier this month. Kookmin said it would wait until the legal conflict over KEB is cleared before bidding again for the bank. KEB shares have risen 13.6 percent so far this year, below the wider market's  .KS11  25.1 percent gain. ($1=927.0 Won) (Additional reporting by Cheon Jong-woo and Kim Yeon-hee)
