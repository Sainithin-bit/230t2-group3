 TORONTO  (Reuters) - The controversial plan to create a Canadian telecom "champion" by merging Telus Corp. ( T.TO ) with market leader BCE Inc. ( BCE.TO ) would not choke competition and require a sale of either company's lucrative wireless network, Telus's chief executive said on Thursday. 

 "We believe there are clear remedies to ensure vibrant and sustainable competition without divesting the mobile networks of either company," Darren Entwistle told reporters. "We believe this proposal offers unique benefits that no other bidder can match." Earlier on Thursday, Telus confirmed it was in talks regarding a possible bid for BCE, a merger that would create a telecom behemoth with 10.9 million wireless subscribers and more than 3 million Internet subscribers. The combined company would have a common-equity value of about C$44 billion ($41.1 billion), annual revenue of more than C$26 billion, and a wireline network of more than 13.1 million access lines. The merger would reshape Canada's telecom landscape by removing one of the three big competitors. The other is Rogers Communications Inc. ( RCIb.TO ), which would be dwarfed if Montreal-based BCE and Vancouver, British Columbia-based Telus tie the knot. For that reason, the deal is sure to face scrutiny from Canadian politicians and regulators. Entwistle said he is moving to head off potential concerns by "proactively" communicating with Ottawa regarding Telus's plans. However, the left-leaning New Democratic Party has already expressed worry about the deal and the implications it would have for telecom competition. As well, a government source told Reuters the government is "blessing nothing" when it comes to the possible BCE-Telus merger and also hinted Ottawa is gathering information on the potential deal. Entwistle said remedies for ensuring that competition thrives include setting aside spectrum space in an upcoming auction to be held by the government. This space could be awarded to a new entrant into the wireless market. Telus hopes this would also mitigate calls for either it or BCE to sell their wireless networks. Wireless is key to telecom firms' profit growth and figures prominently in the merger rationale. The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, which regulates the country's telephone companies, had no comment on Thursday. BCE's shares jumped C$1.57 to C$40.74 on the Toronto Stock Exchange, while Telus fell C$2.11 to close at C$63.65. BCE has also been approached by three buyout bid groups, backed by deep-pocketed U.S. private equity firms that have teamed up with Canadian partners. BCE is a federally regulated company and no non-Canadian concern can own more than 47 percent of the business. "The political sensitivities of a 'Made in Canada' solution and thorny issues of foreign ownership can be circumvented," National Bank Financial analyst Greg MacDonald wrote in a research note. "However, with such a deal there is no clarity on antitrust issues on the Bell and Telus mobility assets." He estimated if Telus bought BCE, between C$700 million and C$800 million in annual operating synergies and another C$200 million in capital expenditure savings could be achieved. Telus said that if it bought BCE, the companies could realize "significant" synergies, retain investment grade credit ratings and preserve a public Canadian investment. UBS analyst Jeffrey Fan said that regulators would want wireless divestitures for the deal to go through, but there is little overlap on the companies' wireline operations. Telus also said that a tie-up would preserve an income tax base for the Canadian government that would be eliminated by a private equity deal structure. The combination would also preserve Canadian control if foreign ownership restrictions are ever removed, Telus said. One of the three buyout consortiums stalking BCE is led by a group of Canadian pension funds and includes U.S. buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Canada's biggest private equity firm, Onex Corp. ( OCX.TO ) Another group is led by Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan and U.S. private-equity firm Providence Equity Partners, and the third is headed by New York-based Cerberus Capital Management.
