 MONTREAL  (Reuters) - BCE Inc. ( BCE.TO ), Canada's largest telecommunications group and the possible target of three international buyout bid groups, said on Wednesday it was in talks to explore the possibility of combining with rival Telus Corp. ( T.TO ) 

 Any merger between BCE, which owns Bell Canada, and Telus, the country's No. 2 telephone company, would send shockwaves through Canada's telecom industry and need high-level Canadian government approval because such a combination would control much of the domestic telephone market. "The government is playing close attention to this evolving situation," a senior government source told Reuters on Wednesday night. The two companies have a combined market capitalization of some C$53.5 billion ($50.5 billion). Bell Canada founded 127 years ago, has some 8.6 million telephone subscribers, 5.8 million wireless customers, and 1.9 million High Speed Internet subscribers. Calgary, Alberta-based Telus has 10.3 million customer connections, 4.6 million wireless subscribers, 4.7 million wireline network access connections and 1 million Internet subscribers. In a brief statement issued on Wednesday evening, BCE said it and Telus had entered into a mutual nondisclosure and standstill agreement on a nonexclusive basis. BCE had previously announced its intention to review strategic alternatives to increase value for shareholders, several of whom have complained about its failure to focus its business and revive its moribund share price. BCE expects to complete that review in the third quarter of 2007. A tie-up between BCE and Telus, long-term rivals that have been competing head-to-head in Canada's top wireless markets, would present a "made-in-Canada" solution to BCE's dilemma in the face of approaches by three buyout bid consortia that are backed by rich U.S. private equity firms. BCE is a Canadian federally regulated company and no non-Canadian concern can own more than 47 percent of the company. U.S. buyout firms hoping to acquire BCE have had to bring in Canadian partners in the form of the country's largest pension funds and its top private equity concern. BCE has not officially given the green light for a full auction of the company, but its special committee of independent directors has said it wants to foster a competitive process by making sure that no one group is able to tie up a "disproportionate share" of Canadian equity. Earlier this month Onex Corp. ( OCX.TO ) Canada's biggest private equity firm, joined the consortium led by Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP) and which includes Kohlberg Kravis Roberts KKR.UL, and Quebec's powerful public pension and insurance fund manager Caisse de depot et placement. The two other consortia interested in BCE are a group led by Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan and U.S. private-equity firm Providence Equity Partners, and one headed by New York-based Cerberus Capital Management CBS.UL. BCE shares fell 18 Canadian cents to C$39.17 on the Toronto Stock Exchange and 22 cents to $36.77 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday. The share have risen almost 29 percent over the past three months, largely on expectations the company will be taken over or taken private.
