 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Institutional Shareholder Services is recommending that Lear Corp. ( LEA.N ) shareholders vote against Carl Icahn's $2.86 billion proposed takeover of the U.S. auto-parts maker because of its price, according to a copy of the report obtained on Thursday. 

 ISS, an influential shareholder advisory company based in Rockville, Md., said $36 per share was fair but does not provide much of a premium given the company's better-than-expected earnings this year. A special committee of the Lear board supports the bid, while one of Lear's largest shareholders, Pzena Asset Management, in a statement on Tuesday said the Icahn offer was too low. Icahn was not immediately available for comment. But Lear officials said ISS was not taking into account the challenges the company faces in remaining independent in a tough auto supplier market. "Obviously, we disagree with their conclusion and our board continues to believe this is a fair transaction for shareholders and represents good value," Lear spokesman Mel Stephens said. "We think that ISS is underestimating the industry risks if we remain as a stand-alone company." ISS in the report said Pzena was arguing for $55 to $60 per share and that Classic Fund Management, with a 5.4 percent stake, also plans to vote against the deal. ISS said it thought the Pzena price was too high for Lear. Shareholders opposed to Icahn's offer tried to delay the vote, but a Delaware judge denied their request. The vote is due at its June 27 annual meeting. Lear shares were off 9 cents at $36.50 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
