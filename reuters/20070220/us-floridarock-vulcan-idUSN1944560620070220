 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Vulcan Materials Co. ( VMC.N ), a maker of highway construction materials, said on Monday it agreed to buy Florida Rock Industries Inc. FRK.N in a cash and stock deal worth around $4.6 billion. 


 The purchase allows Vulcan to expand its presence in Florida and other high-growth markets in the U.S. Southeast and Mid-Atlantic states, the Birmingham, Alabama-based company said. The companies make construction aggregates such as granite, sandstone, limestone and gravel for roads and sidewalks. The Vulcan bid comes as the world's third-biggest cement maker, Cemex CEMXCPO.MX, has a US$12 billion bid pending for Australian building materials maker Rinker Group Ltd. RIN.AX, Florida Rock's biggest local rival. ABN AMRO analyst Simon Thackray said Vulcan is offering 11.3 times forecast earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for Florida Rock compared with the 8.8 multiple Cemex is offering for Rinker. EBITDA is a measure to gauge cash flow. "Obviously this sets a bit of a benchmark in terms of what companies are prepared to pay in the sector," Richard Morris, investment manager with Constellation Capital Management, said. Rinker shares jumped 6.7 percent in Australia on Monday on hopes that Cemex would raise its bid to match the pricing on the Vulcan deal. Florida Rock shareholders can elect to receive either 0.63 shares of the new holding company or $67 in cash for each Florida Rock share, with the buyer seeking to ensure that an aggregate 70 percent of Florida Rock shares will be converted into cash and 30 percent converted into stock. Vulcan Materials said the deal, to close by the mid-year, is neutral to 2007 earnings and accretive beyond that. The company expects around $50 million in annual pre-tax cost synergies. Florida Rock President and Chief Executive John Baker will join Vulcan Materials' board after the deal, and Vice President Tom Baker will become president of Vulcan Materials' new Florida Rock Division headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida. The Baker family founded the company and is its largest shareholder. Florida Rock's operations in Georgia, Virginia, Maryland and other states will be integrated into existing Vulcan divisions. After the deal, Vulcan Materials will have around $3.7 billion in debt. Vulcan says it employs about 9,000 people, with more than 350 production facilities serving 21 states, the District of Columbia and Mexico. (Additional reporting by  Sonali Paul  in Australia)
