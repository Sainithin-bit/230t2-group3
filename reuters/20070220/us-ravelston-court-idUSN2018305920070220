 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - A lawyer for Ravelston Corp. Inc., a Toronto holding company once controlled by indicted media magnate Conrad Black, said on Tuesday the company must wait for Black's appeal to be heard in Canada before it can plead guilty in the U.S. fraud case. 


 Ravelston's court-appointed receiver in Canada, RSM Richter, has sought to reach a plea agreement with U.S. prosecutors where the company would plead guilty and pay a $7 million fine as part of the larger criminal fraud and racketeering case against Black and three former associates. RSM Richter had won a Canadian court's permission to plead guilty on behalf of Ravelston, but Black has appealed to a higher court. Black, who was forced out of leadership posts at privately held Ravelston in 2005, has argued the U.S. court lacks jurisdiction over the Canadian company and that a guilty plea would penalize him if he is later exonerated. The appeal in Canada will be heard on February 26, and a ruling could be expected within a week, a lawyer representing Ravelston told U.S. District Court Judge Amy St. Eve. St. Eve is overseeing the U.S. fraud and racketeering trial of Black, three former associates and Ravelston, which is set to begin in Chicago in mid-March. Black and the others are accused of operating schemes that siphoned millions of dollars from U.S. media publisher Hollinger International as properties were sold off. Black and three other former executives have pleaded not guilty while a fourth, former Black lieutenant David Radler, pleaded guilty to one fraud count in September 2005 and agreed to testify against the others. Black and Radler were the principal owners of Ravelston, which once controlled Toronto-based holding company Hollinger Inc. HLGc.TO . Hollinger Inc. in turn had a controlling interest in Chicago-based publishing company Hollinger International Inc. HLR.N. Hollinger International has been stripped of its largest properties other than the Chicago Sun-Times and some regional newspapers and it renamed itself Sun-Times Media Group SVN.N in July 2006. Since the name change its shares have lost 44 percent of their value and were down 7 cents to $4.24 around midday on Tuesday at the New York Stock Exchange.
