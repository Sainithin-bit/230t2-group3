 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Boyd Gaming Corp. ( BYD.N ) said on Tuesday its fourth-quarter profit more than doubled as it collected on hurricane damage insurance and results at its Las Vegas casinos stabilized, and its shares rose more than 6 percent. 


 Net income increased to $56.3 million, or 64 cents a share, from $22.9 million, or 25 cents a share, a year earlier. Results included a net gain of nearly $30 million from insurance claims. The Las Vegas-based company reported earnings of 45 cents per share before special items, beating the analysts' average estimate of 38 cents as compiled by Reuters Estimates. Bear Stearns analyst Joe Greff said Boyd benefited by improving business at casinos that cater Las Vegas residents, rather than tourists. The company, which has suffered in the past year by increased competition between casinos for Las Vegas locals, said fourth-quarter earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization at its local casinos fell 4.5 percent to $70.4 million. But that was an improvement from the previous quarter, when EBITDA dropped 21 percent year-over-year. "We are encouraged by directional improvement in Las Vegas locals, and expect continued improvement through 2007," Deutsche Bank analyst Bill Lerner said in a research note. Quarterly revenue fell 4.2 percent to $520.8 million after Boyd closed its Las Vegas Strip Stardust resort in November to make way for a new development and sold off another casino. Analysts had expected revenue of $509.9 million. Boyd said EBITDA at its midwestern and U.S. Gulf Coast casinos fell to $50.7 million from $66.9 million as more competition emerged. In Atlantic City, where Boyd operates the Borgata casino in a joint venture with MGM Mirage ( MGM.N ), adjusted EBITDA fell to $53.2 million from $62.6 million. Boyd attributed the decline to lower winnings at table games and higher fixed costs. The company said it expected to begin construction in the second quarter on its planned hotel, retail and casino project on the Las Vegas Strip. The development, to be called Echelon Place, is slated to open in the third quarter of 2010. Boyd said it had increased the budget for the wholly owned components of the project to $3.3 billion from $2.9 billion due to additional scope, larger rooms and increased estimated construction costs. The company's shares were up $2.85, or 6.2 percent, at $48.83 in morning New York Stock Exchange trade. (Additional reporting by  Paritosh Bansal  and  Bill Rigby  in New York)
