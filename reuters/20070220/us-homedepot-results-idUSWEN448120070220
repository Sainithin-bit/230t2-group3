 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Home Depot Inc. ( HD.N ), the world's largest home improvement retailer, posted a 28 percent drop in fourth-quarter profit on Tuesday as the weak U.S. housing market depressed sales. 


 Frank Blake, who stepped into the chief executive job last month after Robert Nardelli resigned, said that Home Depot would get back to basics to win market share, investing in customer service improvements, store appearance, products and commercial customers. "We are past, present and future a retail business," Blake told analysts during a conference call. Blake cautioned, however, that the company does not expect a dramatic turnaround in the housing market this year and said the company would give its financial outlook at next week's analyst meeting. Nardelli abruptly left Home Depot in January following a year of criticism over issues that included his pay package and the retailer's stock performance. Earnings in the fourth quarter ended January 28 fell to $925 million, or 46 cents a share, from $1.3 billion, or 60 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding expenses of 4 cents a share tied to severance for Nardelli and other executives, profit came to 50 cents a share in the latest period, the company said. Analysts on average expected earnings of 51 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 4 percent to $20.3 billion, missing analysts' estimates of $20.8 billion. WEAK RESULTS "The near-term earnings visibility is not good," said Jim Hardesty, president of Hardesty Capital Management in Baltimore, which owns Home Depot stock. "It's going to be slow going before an upward earnings pattern becomes more visible." Retail store sales fell 2 percent to $17.4 billion. Sales at Home Depot Supply, which provides building materials and other products to cities and contractors, rose 64 percent to $2.9 billion, helped by acquisitions. Customer transactions and the average purchase fell at the retail stores, which account for 87 percent of Home Depot's total sales and 93 percent of operating income. Sales at stores open at least a year were down 6.6 percent. The company said consumers took on fewer big-ticket jobs such as kitchen remodels. Home Depot, which faces more competition as rival Lowe's Cos. ( LOW.N ) looks to expand in the United States, Canada and Mexico, said last week that it was considering a sale, spin-off or initial public offering of the supply segment to focus on its core stores, where sales have slumped as U.S. home purchases and construction weakened. The chain has "to work on the sales staff in the stores themselves," said Bill Schultz, chief investment officer at McQueen, Ball & Associates, which owns Home Depot stock. "Lowe's has obviously won out in more of the consumer-friendly areas." SUPPLY BUSINESS PRESSURED Existing U.S. home sales fell 8 percent in 2006, their biggest drop since 1989. Housing starts fell 13 percent last year, their biggest tumble in 15 years. Home sales and construction are key drivers of home improvement sales. The supply business had a worse margin performance than Home Depot stores. During the fourth quarter, gross margin in that business fell 137 basis points to 27 percent, compared with a 70 basis-point drop to 33.6 percent for the retail stores. "Margins in the supply business were decelerating quickly," said Arun Daniel, an analyst with ING Investment Management. "The challenge is who is going to be the buyer and are they willing to pay a higher premium." The 4 cents-a-share expense for severance costs in the quarter included payouts to Nardelli, who had a severance package of $210 million, and four other officers. Analysts currently expect profit of $2.85 a share for the year ending in early 2008, down slightly from $2.86 a share for the just-ended year, according to Reuters Estimates. Home Depot's shares fell 10 cents, or less than 1 percent, to $41.34 on the New York Stock Exchange, while Lowe's rose 46 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $33.73. Home Depot's stock has fallen about 1.2 percent in the past year, and Lowe's has risen about 2 percent.
