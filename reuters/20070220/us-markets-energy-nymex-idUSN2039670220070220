 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil futures fell sharply on Tuesday, slumping more than $2 in morning trading, as warmer weather in the U.S. Northeast was expected to curb heating oil demand and as the March contract headed to expiration. 


 "Refinery glitches, combined with geopolitical anxiety ahead of a long weekend, sparked the rally last Friday," Mike Fitzpatrick, vice president for energy risk management at Fimat USA wrote in a research note. "Prices have pulled back significantly, particularly heating oil, as weather remains the primary focus." At 10:57 a.m. EST (1557 GMT) on the New York Mercantile Exchange, March crude CLH7 was down $1.89, or 3.18 percent, at $57.50 a barrel, trading from $57.32 to $59.25. Support was charted at $57, then at $55.75. Resistance was charted at $60. April crude CLJ7 was down $1.95 or 3.26 percent, at $57.91, trading from $57.78 to $59.86. In London, ICE April Brent crude LCOJ7 was down $1.16, or 2.0 percent, at $56.98 per barrel, trading from $56.81 to $58.50. U.S. heating demand was expected to be about 11 percent below normal this week, the National Weather Service said Monday in its weekly report. Last week's heating demand was just over 23 percent above normal. This week, heating oil demand was expected to average more than 2 percent below normal, with natural gas heating demand 12 percent below normal and heating demand for electricity nearly 14 percent below normal, the NWS report said. In the U.S. Northeast, heating demand will average near to below normal the next five days, private forecaster DTN Meteorlogix predicted Tuesday. The six-to-10-day Meteorlogix forecast called for near to above normal readings. Brokers and traders noted that products futures were not supported by the downed Valero refinery in Sunray, Texas, where an explosion and fire hit late on Friday. Valero was considering moving up a planned April overhaul of a hydrocracker and combining it with repairs expected to begin shortly at the 170,000 barrel-per-day refinery, closed since the Friday explosion, a spokeswoman said Monday. Chevron Corp. ( CVX.N ) began restarting a fluidic catalytic cracking unit at its 243,000 bpd San Francisco-bay area refinery in Richmond, California, on Sunday evening, according to a notice filed with state regulators. NYMEX March heating oil HOH7 was down 6.34 cents, or 3.79 percent, at $1.61 per gallon, trading from $1.6055 to $1.6690. Support was charted at $1.60. Resistance was slated at $1.70. March RBOB RBH7 was down 3.43 cents, or 2.08 percent, at $1.6110 a gallon, trading from $1.61 to $1.6650. Support was charted at $1.60, with resistance at $1.70. "But I think we need to be very cautious in here," said Nauman Barakat, senior vice president at Macquarie Futures USA. "You saw how the market spiked in the last hour of trading on Friday on the possibility of the Nigerian strife getting from bad to worse as we get to closer to the elections in that country in April." While winter's end pressures oil markets Tuesday, analysts, brokers and traders were all noting the ability of geopolitical tensions to ratchet up prices in a hurry. Militant attacks in Nigeria have shut a fifth of the OPEC member's oil output, with more turmoil expected as the country's April elections approach. Iran, the world's fourth largest crude oil exporter, has been unable to resolve the dispute with the United Nations over the Iranian nuclear program. Monday's U.S. holiday will delay government and industry oil inventory reports until Thursday morning, which will mean oil and natural gas data will arrive on the same day.
