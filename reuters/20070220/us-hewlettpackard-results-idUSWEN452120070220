 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard Co. ( HPQ.N ) said on Tuesday quarterly profit rose 26 percent, helped by strong performances in its printer and personal computing businesses. 


 Net income for its fiscal first quarter rose to $1.55 billion, or 55 cents per share, from $1.23 billion, or 42 cents per share, a year ago. Revenue rose 11 percent to $25.1 billion from $22.7 billion. The world's biggest maker of personal computers and printers had said in November it expected first-quarter net earnings per share of 55 cents to 57 cents on revenue of $24.1 billion to $24.3 billion. In the calendar fourth quarter, HP continued to take market share from longtime rival Dell Inc. DELL.O, which has stumbled in recent quarters and where founder Michael Dell took over as CEO again, replacing Kevin Rollins. Market research firm IDC said HP's PC unit shipments rose 24 percent in the fourth quarter, the fastest for HP since 2000. Shares of HP have risen about 4 percent in 2007. The stock trades at 14.7 times its forecasted earnings per share for fiscal 2008, compared with 13.5 times for rival International Business Machines Corp. ( IBM.N ) for 2008. For the current second quarter, HP said it expects earnings per share -- excluding 6 cents per share for amortization of purchased intangible assets -- of 63 cents to 64 cents per share on revenue of about $24.5 billion. Analysts, on average, currently expect second-quarter revenue of $24.1 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. HP said revenue in its imaging and printing business, a mainstay of its profits, rose 7 percent to $7 billion from a year ago and the unit had an operating profit margin of 15.3 percent, up from 14.9 percent a year earlier. HP's PC business, which includes desktop PCs, workstations and notebook computers, saw revenue rise 17 percent to $8.7 billion, and operating profit margin improve to 4.7 percent from 3.9 percent. HP's services revenue increased 5 percent to $3.9 billion from the year-ago period. Revenue at its storage and server business rose 5 percent to $4.5 billion, while operating profit margin in the unit rose to 9.3 percent from 7.7 percent. Software revenue climbed 81 percent to $550 million after HP bought Mercury Interactive last year.
