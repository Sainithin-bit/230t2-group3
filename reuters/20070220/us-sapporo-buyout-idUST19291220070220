 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japanese brewer Sapporo Holdings ( 2501.T ) is considering a management buyout to counter a possible takeover attempt by U.S. hedge fund Steel Partners, Kyodo news agency reported on Wednesday. 


 Kyodo said Sapporo was also considering buying back the shares already held by Steel Partners, which last week announced that it may launch a tender offer to raise its stake in Sapporo to 66.6 percent from about 18.6 percent. Japanese media have reported that rival brewers Asahi Breweries ( 2502.T ) or Kirin Brewery ( 2503.T ) may seek tie-ups with Sapporo to boost their presence in the sluggish domestic beer market while saving Sapporo from a Steel Partners takeover. Kyodo said Sapporo management had started studying the option of a management buyout because an alliance with another brewer would likely force it to consolidate production facilities. Mizuho Corporate Bank, a unit of Mizuho Financial Group Inc. ( 8411.T ) and Sapporo's main lender, intends to offer assistance if Sapporo decides to conduct a buyout, Kyodo said. Sapporo is also looking at the possibility of buying back shares from Steel Partners, which would cost the brewer about 60 billion yen ($500 million) at the current market price, Kyodo said.
