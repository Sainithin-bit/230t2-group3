 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - US Airways Group Inc. Chief Executive Doug Parker has been sentenced to surrender on March 15 and serve 24 hours in jail after pleading guilty to a charge of drunk driving, the airline said on Tuesday. 


 Parker, 45, was arrested for drunk driving on January 31 in Arizona, the day his airline withdrew a failed bid for Delta Air Lines Inc.. Judge Joseph Olcavage of Scottsdale City Court also fined Parker $1,646.25 and required him to complete a medical screening to determine whether he has an alcohol addiction. "At today's hearing, he accepted full and total responsibility for his recent DUI charge by entering a guilty plea to this charge," US Airways said in a statement. "Doug knows he made a serious mistake and has apologized for his actions." Police said on February 9 that a blood test showed Parker had an alcohol level of 0.096 percent, which exceeds the legal limit of 0.080 percent for driving in Arizona. Parker had been clocked driving 65 mph in a 45 mph speed range in his BMW in Scottsdale, a city in the Phoenix valley area. Parker admitted earlier this month to three other alcohol- related incidents in his twenties. He has said, however, that the most recent incident was "a mistake, not a trend." The CEO's day in jail starts one day after US Airways annual Media Day, during which journalists visit the carrier's headquarters to meet with airline officials.
