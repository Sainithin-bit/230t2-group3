 LONDON  (Reuters) - Britain's Shire Plc ( SHP.L ) has agreed to buy U.S. partner New River Pharmaceuticals NRPH.O for $2.6 billion to gain full control of the two firms' new drug for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Vyvanse. 


 Shire's shares jumped as much as 4.5 percent to a 5-1/2 year high of 1,123 pence on news of the deal on Tuesday. New River shares rose 8.8 percent to $63.50 before the opening in New York. Shire, Britain's third-biggest drugmaker, expects Vyvanse to be approved by U.S. regulators later this week and thinks it can be a $1-billion-a-year successor to its top-selling ADHD drug Adderall XR, which is due to lose patent protection in 2009. Shire said it would pay $64 a share in cash for New River and finance the deal with $2.3 billion of new debt facilities, as well as a placing of new shares to raise about $800 million. The company later said it had placed a total of around 42.9 million new shares at 1,075p each, raising gross proceeds of around $900 million or 461 million pounds. The new shares represented around 8.4 percent of Shire's share capital before the placing. The price amounts to almost a 10 percent premium over New River's closing share price of $58.35 on Friday, when its shares rose 6 percent on the day. U.S. markets were closed on Monday. "It's a good deal," said Collins Stewart analyst Navid Malik. "You can't really justify the price on Vyvanse alone, but they're getting some other products and a technology as well, which is the sort of thing they need to be doing." He said the deal could also increase Shire's attraction as a bid target. The British firm is in the midst of a string of new drug launches, and its shares have doubled over the past two years amid speculation it could become a takeover target in an industry where many firms are struggling to deliver new drugs. At 1555 GMT, Shire's shares were up 3.1 percent at 1,108 pence, valuing the firm at 5.6 billion pounds ($10.9 billion). STIMULANT Vyvanse, like most other ADHD drugs, is a stimulant, but it can't be metabolized until it reaches the stomach, which Shire and New River believe makes it less open to abuse. They hope the FDA will confirm this in instructions attached to the drug, which could make it easier to switch patients from Adderall XR. "We are very confident in the FDA outcome," Shire Chief Executive Matthew Emmens told reporters. "We have seen the final draft of the label, and we are comfortable it gives us a way to differentiate and launch this product successfully." Vyvanse has already received two so-called "approvable letters" from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which almost always lead to full approval being granted. Shire expects to launch the medicine in the second quarter of this year. Chief Financial Officer Angus Russell said the deal would dilute earnings in the first two years following completion, but would be earnings neutral in 2009 and would significantly boost them thereafter. As well as Vyvanse, Shire will get New River's NRP290 treatment for acute pain, which is in intermediate Phase II clinical trials, and the U.S. group's Carrierwave technology, which has the potential to help reduce the potential for abuse of drugs. New River founder, chairman and chief executive Randal J. Kirk pledged his 50.2 percent stake in New River to the deal. Shire also posted a 9 percent fall in 2006 underlying earnings per American Depositary Share to 170.1 cents, ahead of analysts' average forecast of 165 cents in a company poll. The firm said the cost of developing and launching new drugs offset an 18 percent rise in Adderall XR sales to $864 million, and that this trend would continue in 2007. Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) and Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) advised Shire on the deal and are bookrunners for its share placing with Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ). Merrill Lynch MER.N and Bear Stearns BSC.N advised New River. (additional reporting by Dan Lalor and Jeff Goldfarb)
