 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Online bank and brokerage E*Trade Financial Corp. ( ETFC.O ) is unveiling an upgrade to its trading Web site that will make it easier for Americans to buy and sell non-U.S. shares online, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday. 


 E*Trade's new Global Trading Platform will allow individual U.S. investors to buy, hold and sell foreign shares in their local currency for stocks in Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United Kingdom, the paper said. E*Trade is also offering broker-assisted trading in additional countries and hopes eventually to include as many as 42 international markets and related currencies in the online system, the paper said. Among E*Trade's main competitors, Charles Schwab Corp. SCHW.O and TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. ( AMTD.O ) both offer foreign trading for American investors, but not online, the paper said, adding that Fidelity Investments said it offered foreign trading online and over the phone. E*Trade is unveiling the trading platform with a pilot launch and plans to make it widely available in the second quarter, the paper said. E*Trade was not immediately available to comment.
