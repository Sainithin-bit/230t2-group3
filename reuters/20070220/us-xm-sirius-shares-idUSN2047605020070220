 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Sirius Satellite Radio ( SIRI.O ) and XM Satellite Radio XMSR.O shares jumped on Tuesday after the companies announced a merger plan, although a top regulator said the deal would face a tough review. 


 Sirius planned to take over XM for about $4.6 billion in stock, which would create a combined company with about $1.5 billion in 2006 revenue and bring on-air talent Oprah Winfrey and shock-jock Howard Stern under one roof. XM shares rose 10 percent to $15.36 and Sirius shares rose 6 percent to $3.92 in early trading on the Nasdaq. Kevin Martin, chairman of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, said the agency would review the deal, but the hurdle was high and the companies had to demonstrate that consumers would be better off with more choices and affordable prices. Sirius and XM argue that the competitive landscape has changed as they now compete with terrestrial radio companies such as Clear Channel Communications Inc. ( CCU.N ) and digital entertainment devices such as Apple Inc.'s ( AAPL.O ) iPod.
