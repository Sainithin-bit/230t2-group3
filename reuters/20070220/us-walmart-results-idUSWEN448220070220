 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) posted a better-than-expected 9.8 percent rise in fourth-quarter profit on Tuesday, helped by cost controls and international sales. 


 The world's largest retailer, whose shares rose more than 3 percent, said net income rose to $3.94 billion, or 95 cents per share, in the fourth quarter that ended on January 31, compared with $3.59 billion, or 86 cents per share a year ago. Fourth-quarter earnings included a boost of $98 million, or 2 cents per share, related to a tax benefit. Excluding the benefit, analysts on average had expected profit of 90 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. The results cap a year in which Wal-Mart's U.S. business struggled through disruptive store remodelings, lackluster response to its efforts to sell trendy clothing and tough comparisons to a year earlier when post-hurricane shopping boosted results. While the retailer downplayed its discount image for much of the year to expand beyond its core lower-income shoppers, it reversed course and vowed its "most aggressive pricing strategy ever" for the holiday season to try to kick start sales. "Wal-Mart U.S. made the difference in our fourth quarter," Chief Executive Lee Scott said on a recorded call. "The U.S. stores increased operating profits 11.3 percent in the fourth quarter. That's well above the 6.7 percent sales increase for the quarter." Wal-Mart's fourth-quarter sales rose almost 11 percent to $98.09 billion, but were below analyst expectations of $99.68 billion. Fourth-quarter sales at its U.S. stores open at least a year -- known as same-store sales -- rose 1.6 percent. In its international business, sales rose almost 30 percent to $22.73 billion, helped by three acquisitions, including raising its stake in Japanese subsidiary Seiyu Ltd. 8268.T "Their international operations, if they can keep growing at this rate plus become more and more profitable, it'll be a pretty significant factor with Wal-Mart," said David Abella, a portfolio manager at Rochdale Investment Management, which owns Wal-Mart shares and has $2.4 billion under management. NEW FISCAL YEAR The retailer said inventory was in good shape after markdowns helped clear slow-selling items, like trendy clothing that was added to compete with rival Target Corp. ( TGT.N ) But Wal-Mart's customers shunned many of the more fashionable items, like skinny-leg pants. "They're really starting to get serious dealing with their merchandising problems," said Joseph Beaulieu, a retail analyst with Morningstar. "I don't think they still believe that catering to high-end consumers and trying to attract them is going to solve their problems." For the first quarter, Wal-Mart expects U.S. same-store sales to increase 1 percent to 3 percent. It forecast earnings per share from continuing operations for the first quarter of 68 cents to 71 cents, and $3.15 to $3.23 for the year. Analysts are expecting first-quarter earnings per share of 68 cents and $3.20 for the year, according to Reuters Estimates. Rochdale's Abella said that the first-quarter outlook had some element of "optimism," but the full-year forecast was conservative. "I think overall it's the smart thing to do because you don't know where the economy is really going to go," he said. Wal-Mart said its fourth-quarter results were helped by a new system that schedules hourly employees based on the number of shoppers in a store. While critics contend the system takes hours away from full-time employees and demands more flexibility from workers, Wal-Mart said it has boosted productivity and cut labor costs. "The productivity of the work force was rock solid during the quarter," Chief Financial Officer Thomas Schoewe said in an interview. Wal-Mart has also resumed store remodeling projects. While the company hopes the projects will make it easier to shop at its stores in the long term, they have hurt sales in the short term. It completed almost two-thirds of the 1,800 store remodel projects in 2006. In the fourth quarter, it also resumed buying back its stock, repurchasing roughly 38.9 million shares. "In our minds the share price where it stands today is a very good value," Schoewe said. He would not comment as to whether the company was considering raising its dividend. In afternoon trading, shares rose $1.50 to $49.98 on the New York Stock Exchange, touching $50.06 earlier in the session. Target shares rose 2.5 percent, or $1.57, to $64.48. Target will report its fourth-quarter results Feb 27.
