 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Medtronic Inc. ( MDT.N ) reported higher quarterly profit on Tuesday as demand for its spine, vascular and neurology products offset weak sales of its implantable devices to control dangerously fast heartbeats. 


 Medtronic said the market for ICDs -- implantable cardioverter defibrillators that can save lives by shocking racing hearts back to normal rhythm -- is not rebounding as quickly as it had expected. High-profile ICD recalls in 2005 and 2006 by Guidant Corp., now a unit of Boston Scientific Corp. ( BSX.N ), hurt demand for the devices as physicians and patients weighed concern about device reliability. Medtronic also acknowledged losing market share to rival ICD makers in the quarter. "The ICD number looks a little light and that's the big focus. Everything else looked pretty much in line," said Leerink Swann analyst Jason Wittes. The Minneapolis-based medical device maker posted a net profit of $710 million, or 61 cents per share, for its fiscal third quarter, compared with a profit of $670 million, or 55 cents per share, a year ago. Analysts on average expected 58 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Third-quarter revenue rose 10 percent to about $3.05 billion. Sales of ICDs, Medtronic's largest product line, fell 2 percent to $711 million. "The ICDs came in light. The stock is down after market because of it. A lot of the other businesses picked up actually," said Jeff Jonas, a portfolio manager with Gamco Medical Opportunities Fund. Revenue in the overall Cardiac Rhythm Disease Management business, which also includes pacemakers, rose 2 percent to $1.29 billion. Spinal revenue rose 12 percent, and revenue from vascular products including stents to treat clogged arteries increased 29 percent. Neurological revenue rose 17 percent and diabetes increased 24 percent. Wittes said the ICD market is still struggling to recover. Last quarter, better-than-expected ICD sales by Medtronic, Boston Scientific and St. Jude Medical Inc. ( STJ.N ) had led several analysts to predict the market was set to resume growth. "I think it's a little too early to call it a bottom here," he said. Medtronic narrowed its earnings per share forecast for fiscal 2007, raising the low end of its previous outlook while lowering the top end of its revenue projection. Medtronic now expects earnings of $2.34 to $2.38 per share on revenue of $12.2 billion to $12.4 billion. It had previously forecast earnings of $2.30 to $2.38 per share and revenue of $12.2 billion to $12.6 billion. Shares of Medtronic fell 2.8 percent to $53.00 in after-market trading Tuesday, from a close of $54.54 on the New York Stock Exchange. Medtronic shares fell about 7 percent in 2006, lagging well behind the S&P 500 Index  .SPX , which rose more than 13 percent last year.
