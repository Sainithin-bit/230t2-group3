 FRANKFURT/DETROIT  (Reuters) - DaimlerChrysler AG DCXGn.DE shares rose more than 4 percent to their highest level since August 2001 on Monday amid continued speculation it could sell or spin off loss-making U.S. arm Chrysler. 


 The stock hit a session peak of 56.34 euros and closed up 3.6 percent at 56.08 euros, while the DJ Stoxx European car sector index .SXAP gained 1.7 percent. Weekend reports that many companies were eyeing Chrysler and that suitors could include South Korea's Hyundai Motor Co ( 005380.KS ) followed Friday's news that DaimlerChrysler was in preliminary talks with General Motors ( GM.N ) on the division. Quoting unnamed people familiar with the talks, the Detroit News paper reported that GM Chief Executive Rick Wagoner met DaimlerChrysler Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche in Detroit in December to discuss the prospect of GM acquiring Chrysler. News of the talks first emerged last week. People familiar with the situation told Reuters on Friday that GM was discussing buying Chrysler or striking an alliance. Both sides have declined comment on the talks. One source familiar with the matter told Reuters that DaimlerChrysler was still evaluating all options for Chrysler, including a spinoff, a restructuring, a sale or a flotation. Analysts have been skeptical about a GM takeover of Chrysler, arguing that such a deal would risk complicating the turnaround efforts of both automakers. The Detroit News said that while talks were still in the early stages, at least four meetings have taken place involving Wagoner, GM Chief Financial Officer Fritz Henderson, Zetsche and DaimlerChrysler Chief Financial Officer Bodo Uebber. The merger talks are ongoing, primarily between Henderson and Uebber, the newspaper said. In Rome, Fiat ( FIA.MI ) Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne told reporters he had "zero" interest in Chrysler. WHAT IS CHRYSLER WORTH? Morgan Stanley said its sum-of-parts approach valued Chrysler at 7 billion euros ($9.2 billion) including healthcare liabilities, or at 3 billion euros to 5 billion based on a leveraged buyout model and including its pension and healthcare burden. "A 5 billion euro equity value for the Chrysler division would be just over 10 percent price to sales, making Chrysler the cheapest car company in the world on our numbers, less than half the value of PSA (Peugeot Citroen) ( PEUP.PA )," Morgan Stanley said in a note to clients. Analysts at Bank Sal. Oppenheim said a GM purchase of Chrysler would add economies of scale for research and development, purchasing and production and also offer potential to eliminate overcapacity -- a chronic problem that helps fuel a price war in North America. But that would require plant closures and tens of thousands more job cuts in an industry already reeling from restructuring at GM, Ford ( F.N ) and Chrysler. Analysts have pointed to Chrysler's unionised workforce, unfunded health and pension liabilities and hefty losses as reasons for investors to think twice about taking on any financial exposure to the number-three U.S. carmaker. They cite the option that DaimlerChrysler could unwind the 1998 merger between Daimler-Benz and Chrysler that created the world's fifth-biggest carmaker and float part of an independent Chrysler on the stock market or spin it off to shareholders. Sal. Oppenheim estimated it would cost around 22.5 billion euros for DaimlerChrysler to divorce itself from Chrysler -- 13.9 billion to finance the pension and healthcare plans and 8.6 billion more to beef up Chrysler's balance sheet. Zetsche told reporters last week all options for Chrysler were on the table but the company has declined to elaborate. JP Morgan ( JPM.N ) is advising the company on Chrysler, according to a source familiar with the matter. Stung by an over-reliance on pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles at a time of high fuel prices, Chrysler swung to an operating loss of 1.12 billion euros last year. It is responding by cutting 13,000 jobs, or 16 percent of its workforce, reducing production capacity and shifting its product focus to more fuel-efficient vehicles and engines.
