 LONDON  (Reuters) - Interest rate uncertainty sapped the dollar and yen on Tuesday while bond investors took profits and stocks took a breather from multi-year highs. 


 Investors are split on whether the Bank of Japan will raise rates to a decade-high of 0.5 percent from 0.25 percent at its two-day policy meeting starting on Tuesday. But with the view growing that this makes little difference either way to the Japanese currency's appeal as a cheap funding vehicle, the yen extended losses against the dollar and euro. A quarter-point rise would still keep Japanese interest rates at the lowest in the industrialized world, against 5.25 percent in the United States and 3.5 percent in the euro zone. "It looks like the BOJ will raise rates tomorrow, but that is very finely balanced," said Barclays Capital currency strategist Adarsh Sinha. "If they raise rates by 25 basis points it's not going to affect the relative attractiveness of foreign assets (for Japanese investors)." The dollar grappled with its own woes, hitting a six-week low against the euro before U.S. inflation figures on Wednesday, and after weak U.S. data and comments from the Federal Reserve chairman stirred expectations the Fed may cut rates this year. By 1300 GMT the dollar was at 120.17 yen  JPY= , further away from a six-week low of 118.96 set last week. The euro was up 0.45 percent at 157.95 yen EURJPY=, approaching its record high of 159.00 set last week. The single currency rose to $1.3189  EUR= , its highest since early January, before trimming gains to $1.3142. PROFIT-TAKING ON BONDS, STOCKS U.S. markets reopen on Tuesday after the Presidents' Day holiday, but trading was thinned in Asia by Lunar New Year holidays in China, Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan, and in Germany by a continuing Carnival break in parts of the country. Treasuries fell as U.S. investors returned from the long weekend to cash in some gains after last week's global fixed income rally, driven by the weak U.S. data and Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke's view that price pressures were starting to ease. As well as inflation data, minutes of the Fed's last policy meeting are due on Wednesday, and bond investors are alert for signs that U.S. rates might not come down as soon as some think. "Tomorrow is a big day for fixed income. In terms of event risk, it's a big day, which provides some incentive to take some profit today," said Richard McGuire, fixed income strategist at RBC Capital Markets in London. Benchmark 10-year cash yields US10YT=RR rose 1.8 basis points to 4.708 percent, up from 4.696 percent in New York trade on Friday, while 2-year cash yields US2YT=RR rose 0.8 basis points to 4.8478 percent. Euro zone government bonds eased on technical factors while traders waited for the Bank of Japan decision and eyed the shrinking U.S.-euro zone yield spread. The 10-year Bund yield EU10YT=RR was 1.14 basis points higher at 4.081. Equity markets also eased from the multi-year highs seen on Monday on speculation over possible takeovers and mergers. The MSCI All-Country World Index was down 0.12 percent at 380.90. The FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of top European shares was 0.33 percent lower at 1,544.88 points, retreating from Monday's six-year peak of 1,552,59. Shares were hurt by disappointing updates from firms including Cadbury Schweppes CBRY.L and Carlsberg ( CARLb.CO ). Energy stocks also weighed as oil prices fell under pressure from the upcoming end of winter oil demand in the United States. London Brent crude oil LCOc1 slid below $58 a barrel. Japan's broadest stocks index, the TOPIX  .TOPX , hit a 15-year peak of 1,784.20 before closing marginally higher, but investors there were generally wary ahead of the rates decision. The main Nikkei average  .N225 , which scaled a near-seven-year high on Monday, closed a whisker down at 17,939.12. Shares on Wall Street were expected to open flat to slightly lower after the long weekend. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  last week posted its best week since November, but analysts said a fall could be on the way.
