 BERLIN  (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel and 
French President Jacques Chirac will discuss the situation at 
Airbus ( EAD.PA ) on Friday but Germany insisted management and 
not politicians should decide on a restructuring of the firm. 


  "Certainly the situation at Airbus will be discussed but 
neither the chancellor or the French president will take any 
corporate decisions," German government spokesman Thomas Steg 
said at a regular news conference in Berlin on Tuesday.  "The responsibility for the necessary decision on a 
restructuring of the company cannot and will not be taken away 
from the management, certainly not by politicians," he added.  The board of Airbus parent EADS ( EAD.PA ) announced on 
Monday it was delaying a long-awaited restructuring 
announcement amid disagreements between European nations over 
how work should be shared out on the planemaker's new A350 
aircraft.  Merkel and Chirac are due to meet on Friday in Meseberg 
north of Berlin for a regular summit which Steg said had no 
fixed agenda.  Steg reiterated the German government's position that a 
restructuring at Airbus must be shared equally between France 
and Germany.  "The government is convinced that the German plants are 
competitive and productive and we that we can expect a good 
long-term outlook for them," he said.  "It is important for the German government that there is no 
interference in the decision process and it's up to the 
management to present a restructuring program."
