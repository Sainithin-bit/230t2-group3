 LONDON  (Reuters) - Shares on Wall Street are expected to open flat to slightly lower on Tuesday, with investors eyeing results from Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ) and Hewlett-Packard Co ( HPQ.N ) for cues after a long weekend. 


 By 1020 GMT, U.S. stock futures were pointing to opening dips of between 0.01 and 0.03 percent for the three main indexes SPc1 DJc1 NDc1. U.S. markets were closed on Monday for the Presidents' Day holiday. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  posted its best week since November last week, helped by optimism about merger activity and reassuring comments about inflation from the Federal Reserve. The index rose 0.02 percent or 2.56 points on Friday to close at 12,767.57 points, while the tech-laden Nasdaq  .IXIC  ended 0.03 percent lower at 2,496.31. But analysts said a fall could be on its way and that investors should not get too greedy. "We're two to three weeks away from some sort of topping out process," said Steve Previs at Jefferies International. "Anybody who's been long since July should take money off the table. It reminds me of the old saying: bulls make money, bears make money, chickens sit on the sideline and cluck. It's the pigs that get slaughtered." In focus will be Sirius Satellite Radio ( SIRI.O ), which said on Monday it plans to buy U.S. rival XM Satellite Radio XMSR.O for $4.6 billion. Weak oil prices could also weigh, with Nymex Crude for March delivery trading almost $1 down at $58.43 a barrel. With Tuesday lean on the macroeconomic front, investors await Wednesday's consumer price data and minutes from the Fed's January 30 to 31 meeting that could provide clues to interest rates. Previs said the focus at both Hewlett-Packard and Home Depot ( HD.N ) -- also among major companies reporting -- would be on the performance of new management and plans for the future rather than on the numbers itself, adding that Wal-Mart's figures could provide crucial clues about the economy. "Wal-Mart's a proxy for the U.S. economy," he said. Home Depot posted fourth quarter earnings per share of 46 cents and adjusted EPS of 50 cents against an expectation of 51 cents according to Reuters Estimates.
