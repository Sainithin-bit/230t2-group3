 (Reuters) - Movie Gallery Inc. MOVI.O said it expects 
$900 million funding to refinance its entire senior secured 
credit facility, a move that may help the No. 2 U.S. movie 
rental chain avoid bankruptcy. 


  The debt-laden company also said it expects same-store 
sales to fall 2.9 percent and operating income of $24 million 
for the fourth quarter. Movie Gallery sees fiscal 2006 revenue 
of $2.54 billion.  Analysts on average expect the company to post revenue of 
$2.56 billion for 2006, according to Reuters Estimates.  The proceeds of the financing will also be used to replace 
existing letters of credit, provide working capital and pay 
other expenses, the company said in a statement.  Movie Gallery said the credit facilities have a five-year 
maturity and the transaction, arranged by Goldman Sachs Credit 
Partners L.P., is expected to close by March 15.  (Reporting by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty, Sweta Singh in
