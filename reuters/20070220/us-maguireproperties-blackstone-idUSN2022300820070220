 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Real estate investment trust Maguire Properties Inc.MPG.N agreed to buy the Orange County and Downtown Los Angeles properties formerly owned by Equity Office Properties from private equity firm Blackstone Group for about $2.88 billion, the company said on Tuesday. 


 The deal is expected to close in the second quarter of 2007 and gives Maguire, which is focused on the Southern California office market the ability to expand its market share through existing property and development of new buildings. Maguire said it intends to find a partner for the deal but initially would go it alone. Under the deal, Maguire will acquire 24 office buildings comprising 8.1 million square feet. The deal translates into about $355 per square foot, said Green Street Advisors analyst Michael Knott. "It's a big deal," Knott said. "It's a high price. But it's not a total jaw dropper." The Orange County office properties comprise about 6.1 million square feet, bringing Maguire's holdings there to 10.3 million square feet. The company has the potential to develop another 3.3 million square feet through the property it owns and will acquire. "This portfolio has significant revenue growth potential as below market rents and parking rates are increased to market rates as well as fee income and promotional interest from the joint venture we plan to form to own these assets," Robert Maguire III, chairman and chief executive," said in a statement."
