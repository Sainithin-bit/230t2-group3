 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Time Warner Cable sued rival DirecTV Group Inc. late on Thursday in Manhattan federal court, alleging the satellite television service issued deceptive ads to get customers for its football programming. 

 DirecTV put out "blatantly false" newspaper ads in New York and television spots in Green Bay, Cincinnati and other cities claiming fans couldn't see local teams' games on the fledgling NFL Network if they were not DirecTV customers, the lawsuit by the Time Warner Inc. unit alleges. "These false ads were obviously targeted at markets where DirecTV believes that loyalty to the local football team will drive consumer purchasing decisions," the suit says. Robert Mercer, a spokesman for DirecTV, declined to comment on the suit on Friday, saying he  had not seen it. NFL Networks is operated by the National Football League with 41 million subscribers in the United States and Canada. It is offered by DirecTV and EchoStar Communications Corp's Dish Network, but it does not have distribution deals with three of the largest cable providers. Specifically, DirecTV ads in the New York Post and New York Newsday newspapers published on November 23 claimed the December 30 New York Giants-Washington Redskins game wouldn't be available to 4.4 million cable customers people in New York unless they subscribe to DirecTV, Time Warner said. Time Warner also alleges in the suit that DirecTV falsely advertises in television ads featuring William Shatner and Jessica Simpson that its high definition television service provides better picture quality than Time Warner's.
