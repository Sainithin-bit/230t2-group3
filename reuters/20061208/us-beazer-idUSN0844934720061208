 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Beazer Homes USA Inc. ( BZH.N ) may be fined more than $1.3 million by the State of New Jersey, which accused the company of violating wetland permits, the company said in a regulatory filing on Friday. 

 In June 2006, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection said that Beazer, the No. 6 U.S. home builder, violated a wetlands disturbance permit and proposed a $630,000 fine, the company said in filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In August 2006, the New Jersey Department accused the company of similar violations concerning another project and proposed fine of $678,000, the filing said. Beazer has requested hearings on the matters and said it intends to contest the agency's findings and the proposed fines, according to the filing.
