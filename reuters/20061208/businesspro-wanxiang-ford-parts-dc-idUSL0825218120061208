 LONDON  (Reuters) - Wanxiang Group, China's top auto parts 
supplier, is in talks with Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) to purchase 
assets from the U.S. carmaker's components business, the 
Financial Times reported, citing the Chinese firm's founder. 

  Lu Guanqiu, who is also chairman of Wanxiang, said the 
discussions were part of a plan to broaden the company's 
presence worldwide, Friday's edition of the newspaper said.  Lu, however, declined to specify which assets his firm was 
interested in or whether a deal was imminent, the FT said.  "We have seen that the quality of (Ford's) assets is all 
right, but because of high labor costs the business is not 
always profitable," he told the newspaper.  The FT said Wanxiang was interested in Ford's advanced 
design and production technology as well as gaining better 
distribution of its own components in the United States.  The assets being focused on involve Automotive Components 
Holdings, a Ford-managed holding company formed in October 2005 
when Ford took back 23 facilities from struggling former parts 
subsidiary Visteon Corp., according to the newspaper.  Lu also said Wanxiang had been in preliminary talks this 
year with Delphi Corp. but no material results had emerged.
