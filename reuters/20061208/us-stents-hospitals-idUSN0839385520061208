 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Tenet Healthcare Corp., which owns about 65 hospitals in the U.S., on Friday said it has not seen a drop in the use of drug-coated heart stents in the wake of recent studies suggesting a heightened risk of blood clots. 

 "We have not seen a drop in the use of drug-coated stents since the studies have come out," Tenet's chief medical officer, Jennifer Daley, told Reuters. "Doctors are very conservative people. At the moment, we have conflicting studies." U.S. advisers to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration are meeting today to discuss the risk of blood clots associated with the wire-mesh devices for propping open diseased arteries.
