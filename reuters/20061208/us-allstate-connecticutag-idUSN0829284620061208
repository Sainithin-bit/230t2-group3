 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said on Friday he was expanding his probe into Allstate Corp. ( ALL.N ), a day after the insurer said it would stop writing new homeowners' policies in his state. 

 The news, which had little effect on Allstate's stock, was seen by some analysts as an attempt to get Allstate to back down. "Blumenthal may be jawboning Allstate, trying to get it to retreat," said Donald Light, an analyst with Celent LLC. Allstate spokesman Michael Trevino had no immediate comment. Shares of the largest publicly traded home and auto insurer were up 26 cents, to $63.93 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Allstate had said on Thursday that it would no longer write new policies in Connecticut, New Jersey and Delaware, part of its move out of storm-prone and coastal areas such as Florida, where it has lost billions in recent years. Blumenthal's insurance probe started in August as an investigation into nine insurers, including Allstate, that were forcing homeowners to install hurricane shutters or lose their coverage. Most were private companies. Blumenthal said in a statement that he had expanded that investigation to include Allstate's announcement that it would stop writing new homeowner policies in his state and increase premiums on existing ones. "Even if Allstate may be within its legal rights to cease doing business in Connecticut, its decision may be the result of other anti-competitive or antitrust practices," said Blumenthal. Analysts said it was doubtful that Blumenthal could prove antitrust allegations or force Allstate to back down. "By leaving Connecticut, Allstate is simply reacting to places where it can't get rates high enough to justify its risk," said Jim Ryan, an insurance analyst with Morningstar. "This doesn't affect our value of Allstate at all."
