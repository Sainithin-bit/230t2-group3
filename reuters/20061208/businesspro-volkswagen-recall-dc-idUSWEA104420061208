 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Volkswagen ( VOWG.DE ), the world's 
fourth largest carmaker, is recalling just over 300,000 VW 
brand Passat mid-size cars due to three different problems 
affecting models from the year 2005 to 2007, it said on Friday. 

  Many have problems with a wiper motor, while some 
diesel-powered Passats can leak fuel and those equipped with a 
200 horsepower engine may have a power brake vacuum line that 
may fracture at low ambient temperatures, resulting in the 
brake power assist becoming inoperative.  Alone in Germany, roughly 130,000 cars are being recalled, 
while in the United States and Canada, for example, some 62,000 
Passats are affected.
