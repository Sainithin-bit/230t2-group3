 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Canadian buyout firm Onex Corp. ( OCX.TO ) and a unit of investment bank Goldman Sachs Group Inc. ( GS.N ) are in exclusive talks with Raytheon Co. ( RTN.N ) to buy the defense contractor's aircraft unit, according to a source close to the process. 

 Onex and Goldman could did not immediately return calls and Raytheon, which has hired investment bank Credit Suisse Group ( CSGN.VX ) to run the auction, has said it will not speak publicly about the sale until a deal has been reached. Raytheon, the No. 5 Pentagon contractor, put its Raytheon Aircraft Co. unit up for sale in July. The unit -- which makes business jets under the Beechcraft and Hawker names, as well as military training planes -- has been lagging competitors and falling behind Raytheon's more profitable defense operations. The unit, which traces its roots back more than 70 years to the founding of the Beech Aircraft Corp. in 1932, had $2.9 billion in sales last year. It competes directly with General Dynamics Corp.'s ( GD.N ) Gulfstream unit, Textron Inc.'s ( TXT.N ) Cessna unit and Canada's Bombardier Inc. ( BBDb.TO ), which makes Lear jets. Industry-watchers have noted that a foreign corporation such as Onex would face greater scrutiny as a buyer of U.S. defense-related assets. The approval process could reach the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States, which is administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, now headed by former Goldman Sachs chief Henry Paulson, who is U.S. Treasury Secretary.
