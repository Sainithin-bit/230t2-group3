 GAITHERSBURG, Maryland  (Reuters) - The Food and Drug Administration should consider telling patients and doctors that the use of drug-coated heart stents in unapproved, high-risk cases can lead to greater complications, a panel of medical experts said on Friday. 

 Labels for the devices, currently sold in the United States by Johnson & Johnson and Boston Scientific Corp., should reflect that those patients face a higher chance of blood clots that can lead to heart attacks and death, said panel chairman, Dr. William Maisel of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. "I think the panel would like to see the amount of off-label use go down," he said following a two-day public hearing called by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA sought out the advice of its outside experts after research earlier this year showed drug-coated stents -- tiny mesh tubes that work to keep arteries open after they are unclogged -- can cause blood clots months after implantation. While the FDA has not approved drug-coated stents for patients who have had complications such as severe heart attacks or totally-blocked arteries, doctors are still free to use them instead of older, bare-metal versions. More than half of drug-coated stents are used in unapproved patients, the FDA says. There were no formal votes concerning off-label use of drug-coated stents. The FDA is not bound by the advice of its expert panels but usually takes it into consideration. Overall, the panel of cardiologists and other experts said there was not enough data for doctors to decide the best care for patients. Studies for future drug-coated stents should be expanded to assess the risk of blood clots, Maisel said. "I think we are saying ... they need to be larger, longer and give us some ideas of thrombosis rates for individual stents," he said. Abbott Laboratories Inc. and Medtronic Inc. are two other device makers seeking to sell their drug-coated stents in the United States as early as next year. But Dr. Daniel Schultz, director of the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said the amount of data needed for companies seeking approval for new drug-coated stents has not changed. He declined to comment about specific applications. Some analysts, who watched the advisory panel meeting closely for clues on how the agency may proceed, also said they saw no impact for Medtronic or Abbott. "This will have no effect on them... their application is already being reviewed. The FDA is not likely to throw the ball back in their court," said Ira Loss, a health care analyst with Washington Analysis Corp.
