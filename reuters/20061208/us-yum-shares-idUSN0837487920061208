 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Yum Brands Inc. ( YUM.N ) shares fell 3.5 percent on Friday after an analyst downgraded the stock due to concerns about slowing sales momentum in the United States and difficult upcoming sales comparisons at KFC and Taco Bell. 

 Wachovia Securities analyst Jeffrey Omohundro, who lowered his rating on the stock from "Outperform" to "Market perform," also said there could be a short-term, although potentially significant, negative sales impact at Taco Bell related to its recent E. coli outbreak in the Northeastern United States. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 58 people in six states have been sickened by the bacteria, and most of those cases have been traced to Taco Bell restaurants. Taco Bell closed a number of stores voluntarily and pulled green onions, also known as scallions, from all of its 5,800 U.S. restaurants after tests showed three samples were "presumptive positive" for a strain of E. coli. After Yum held an analyst meeting in New York on Tuesday J.P. Morgan analyst John Ivankoe recommended investors take profits on Yum shares, which are up 27 percent this year, and fully valued, in his opinion. Yum, based in Louisville, Kentucky, has been placing greater emphasis on its international businesses such as KFC and Pizza Hut in China, France and India, as it tries to revive its business at home, which has been struggling. "We believe the strategy outlined by the company to turn around operating results in fiscal 2007 is suspect," said Ivankoe about the U.S. business in a research note. "A proposed breakfast at Taco Bell, improved lunch (business) at Pizza Hut, and continuation of current strategy at KFC despite recent softness are all risky." Yum shares were down $2.13 at $58.95 on the New York Stock Exchange.
