 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A stronger-than-forecast 132,000 jobs were created in November, according to a government report on Friday that implied the U.S. economy had more underlying resilience than previously thought. 

 The Labor Department, however, said the unemployment rate edged up to 4.5 percent from the 5-1/2-year low of 4.4 percent it reached in October, and a separate report pointed to waning U.S. consumer confidence in December. But analysts focused on the new-jobs total that topped Wall Street economists' forecasts for 110,000 jobs. "The conclusion is that this is a Goldilocks economy; not too hot, not too cold," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer for Johnson Illington Advisers in Albany, New York. Stock prices posted modest gains on the signs of a healthy job market, with the Dow Jones industrial average adding 29.08 points to close at 12,307.49. The high tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 9.67 points to end at 2,437.36. But prices for debt securities declined across the board as investors bet the job report meant that any U.S. interest-rate cuts will be at least delayed. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell 17/32 of a point and its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 4.55 percent while 30-year bonds dropped 25/32 to yield 4.66 percent, up from 4.61 percent on Thursday. CAUTIOUS SHOPPERS Consumers remain wary, according to the University of Michigan survey. Its consumer sentiment index slipped to 90.2 in December from 92.1 in November, raising questions whether shoppers will spend as much during the holiday shopping season leading up to Christmas. The jobs report, while surprisingly strong, did not make a convincing case by itself for the Fed to do anything but continue to keep rates on hold as it has since mid-summer, said economist Richard Yamarone of Argus Research Corp in New York. "There's very little in this report that will sway the Fed in the near term, but rising wage inflation and stellar job creation could support a Fed rate hike in mid-2007," Yamarone said. The central bank's policy-making group meets on December 12 and is widely expected to keep benchmark rates steady at 5.25 percent for a fourth straight meeting. All the November hiring occurred in service industries, where 172,000 jobs were added, while goods-producing industries shed 40,000 jobs. Some 29,000 construction jobs were lost in November on top of a 24,000-job reduction in October, reflecting the reduced level of activity in homebuilding and other construction. FACTORIES LAYING OFF Another 15,000 manufacturing jobs were lost in November after 44,000 were cut in October. The department revised down the number of jobs created in October to 79,000 from a previously reported 92,000 but it said that, in September, a robust 203,000 jobs were created instead of 148,000 as it had reported previously. Average weekly hours worked were unchanged in November at 33.9. Average hourly earnings rose 0.2 percent, slightly less than the 0.3 percent that had been forecast. The number of overtime hours that were worked on average in November fell to 4.2 from 4.3, the lowest for any month since August 2003 when they were 4.1 hours, according to a department spokesman. Pierre Ellis, senior economist for Decision Economics in New York, said the jobs report helped counter concern arising from some signs of softness in recent indicators that the economy might be headed for a sharp slowdown. "The November employment report reinforced confidence that the economy is basically stable, not weakening as many other indicators have lately suggested," Ellis said. "Soft economic activity is isolated to the construction and manufacturing sectors. There's no evidence of broadening problems."
