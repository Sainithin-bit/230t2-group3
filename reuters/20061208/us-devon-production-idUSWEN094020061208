 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - Independent oil and gas producer Devon Energy Corp. ( DVN.N ) on Friday trimmed its production forecasts through 2009 as Canadian gas output continued to suffer because of weak margins. 

 Output for the fourth quarter would grow by 7 percent from the year-ago level to about 57 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) rather than the 58 million to 59 million boe it had forecast last month, Devon said. Shares of the Oklahoma City-based company slipped 1.3 percent to $72.67 on the New York Stock Exchange, underperforming the broader Standard & Poor's Energy Index .GSPE which was up 0.2 percent. . Rising costs to produce gas in Western Canada have pressured margins, the company said, forcing it to trim output forecasts. "Competitive pressure for equipment, service and supplies in Canada have created a highly inflationary cost environment. In addition, the strengthening of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar has negatively impacted profit margins on these projects," the company said in a statement. For the full year, production will be about 216 million boe, including 2 million boe from its Egyptian assets, which it said in November it would sell. For 2007, oil and gas production was now expected to rise 8 percent to 230 million to 232 million boe, down from the previous forecast of 421 million boe. Production in 2008 will rise about 10 percent from 2007 to between 251 million and 258 million boe compared to its earlier expectation of 276 million boe. Output in 2009 was expected to between 270 million to 285 million boe rather than the previous forecast for 299 million boe.
