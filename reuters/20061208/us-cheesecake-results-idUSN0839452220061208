 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Cheesecake Factory Inc. ( CAKE.O ) on Friday filed with U.S. securities regulators to correct errors it found in previous financial statements. 

 It said the errors were due to how it accounted for gift cards, how it recorded expenses for bonuses, and how it amortized the cost of liquor licenses. The restaurant operator said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission the aggregate adjustments increased net income by $400,000 in fiscal year 2005, reduced net income by $1.2 million in fiscal year 2004 and reduced by $1.6 million in fiscal year 2003. The adjustments increased earnings per share by 1 cent for the year ended January 3, 2006, and decreased it by 2 cents for the year ended December 28, 2004 and by 3 cents for the year ended December 30, 2003. It said earnings per share were unchanged for the first quarter of fiscal 2006. The restatement adjustments were non-cash and had no impact on net cash flow, it said. Cheesecake Factory said it found the errors as a results of probe into its accounting for stock based compensation.
