 LONDON  (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures were flat to lower on Friday but Wall Street's opening was expected to be decided by a key U.S. employment data report, which is seen as an important pointer to future interest moves. 

 U.S. non-farm payrolls data for November is due at 8:30 a.m. EST, (1330 GMT) an hour before the market opening. Forecasts are for a rise of 110,000 new jobs compared with a rise of 92,000 the previous month, according to a Reuters poll. But the derivatives action suggests the market is now pricing in a lower number of 85,800 new jobs. "Non-Farm payroll data in isolation is rather meaningless with all the usual adjustments, but the trend at the moment is a decent barometer to judge whether the U.S. economy is heading for a hard landing or a soft one," said David Buik at spreadbetting firm Cantor Index. Companies in focus include business software giant Oracle Corp. ORCL.O, which boosted its offer for Indian banking software provider i-flex Solutions Ltd. IFLX.BO by 42 percent to $1.3 billion. Crude oil prices were higher after a trade source said expected delivery from North Sea Brent crude oil was scheduled to fall sharply in January from December. U.S. light crude CLc1 rose 1 percent to $63.11 a barrel and London Brent crude LCOc1 was up 1.4 percent at $63.50.
