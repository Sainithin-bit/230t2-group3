 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said on Friday that November's U.S. jobs report was "good news" and indicated economic growth was on a solid path. 

 "We're also seeing this job creation starting to translate into real wage growth for the average working family in America," Paulson told CNBC TV in an interview after data showed 132,000 jobs were created last month, adding: "Everything that I look at makes me feel very good that we have made a very successful transition from an economy that was growing at a rate that was not sustainable, to one that is growing at a sustainable rate. And I feel very, very good about our chance of having a really sustained expansion here."
