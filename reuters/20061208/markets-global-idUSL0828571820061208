   (Updates throughout, adds Walls Street outlook) 

  By  Jeremy Gaunt , European Investment Correspondent LONDON  Dec 8 (Reuters) - Stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs
growth failed to answer investor questions about the future of
the U.S. economy and interest rates on Friday, leaving European
stocks and the dollar lower and setting Wall Street on track to
open down.  Treasury prices slipped as some investors saw the jobs
report adding to pressure to keep U.S. interest rates higher but
European bonds reversed course and rose.  The U.S. Department of Labor said 132,000 jobs were created
in November.  Economists polled by Reuters beforehand had expected an
increase of 110,000. Derivatives auctions before the report's
release suggested the market was pricing in a lower 92,900 new
jobs.  Analysts said the report would not end questions about where
the U.S. economy was heading.  "Those who believe the U.S. economy is heading for a hard
landing will not be swayed by this number ... those who believe
... that we're in for a soft landing will find some consolation
in this number, we're still creating jobs," said Marc Chandler,
chief global currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman.  The dollar initially rose against the euro on the prospect
that U.S. interest rates would not be cut soon, but then
reversed course.  Middle Eastern, Asian and Russian players were said to have
entered the market selling dollars and buying euros on the
single currency's dip.  The euro was up 0.4 percent at $1.3341.  European shares steadied after the report, but then fell.
The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares  .FTEU3  was
down 0.4 percent.  U.S. stock index futures, however, also turned from positive
to negative.  U.S Treasury yields were off their highs but still up 1.4
basis points at 4.5006 percent. Yields in Europe were flat to
lower after earlier rising on the jobs news.
