 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Volkswagen of America Inc. said on Friday it would recall 62,000 Passat sedans and wagons from the 2006 and 2007 model years in the U.S. and Canada because of potential problems with wiper motors or braking in cold weather. 

 Volkswagen ( VOWG.DE ) said it would begin to notify the vehicle owners in January about the recall. On some vehicles, a power brake vacuum line could fracture at low ambient temperatures and require increased effort to stop.
