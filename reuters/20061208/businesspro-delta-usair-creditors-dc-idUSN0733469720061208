 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A group of nine unsecured creditors of 
Delta Air Lines Inc. DALRQ.PK have formed an unofficial 
committee to represent their interests, as the bankrupt carrier 
faces a takeover bid, according to court filings on Thursday. 

  The formation of the unofficial committee, which consists 
of creditors such as Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and Lehman 
Brothers Inc., comes after US Airways Group Inc. ( LCC.N ) made 
an unsolicited $8.6 billion takeover offer for Delta on 
November 15.  Unsecured creditors in Delta's bankruptcy are already 
represented by one official committee, which consists of nine 
of Delta's largest creditors whose claims are not backed by 
collateral.  But none of the members of the new group are on the 
official creditor committee.  Atlanta-based Delta, which has been operating under Chapter 
11 protection since September 2005, has said it intends to 
emerge from bankruptcy protection in the first half of 2007 as 
a stand-alone carrier and aims to file its reorganization plan 
this month. Delta's management has said it would review US 
Airways' offer as it is obligated to do.  The new group was expected to put pressure on Delta to 
fully consider the US Airways bid as an alternative to its 
stand-alone strategy, a person familiar with the matter said in 
November, when the group was being organized.  Delta's pilot union, which is part of the official creditor 
committee, has opposed US Airways' bid, saying it prefers the 
airline to remain independent.  Members of the new unofficial committee hold claims on 
unsecured obligations and securities issued by Delta, according 
to the filing. It did not say how much the members held among 
them.
