 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc. ( C.N ) on Friday denied persistent speculation that Chief Financial Officer Sallie Krawcheck was leaving the biggest U.S. bank, but declined to confirm she will stay in her current role. 

 "She is not leaving," a Citigroup spokesman said. Asked if Krawcheck would change posts at Citigroup, the spokesman said: "All I can tell you is that she is not leaving the company. I'm leaving it at that." Todd Leone, head of listed trading at Cowen & Co. in New York, confirmed that rumors persist about Krawcheck leaving Citigroup. Paul Foster, an options strategist at Web information site theflyonthewall.com in Chicago, said there is also speculation Citigroup is considering asset divestitures and that Bank of America's Chief Financial Officer Alvaro de Molina was planning to join Citigroup as its new top financial officer. De Molina said earlier this month he will resign as Bank of America's CFO at the end of the year. He is supposed to help the bank in the transition with the new CFO through the end of March. Bank of America was not available for comment. Citigroup shares were up nearly 3 percent at $52.11 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Earlier in the day, the stock rose as much as 4 percent, its biggest gain in nearly eight months. (Additional reporting by  Mark McSherry  in New York)
