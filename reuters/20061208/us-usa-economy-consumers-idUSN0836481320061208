 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. consumer sentiment ebbed in December as consumers pared back their view of their future financial conditions, raising concerns on the outlook for spending. 

 The University of Michigan said on Friday its preliminary reading on consumer sentiment in December was 90.2, down from November's reading of 92.1, and below economists' median forecast for 92.0. "We are seeing a tailing off after a jump in September from the fall in energy prices. This along with the income proxy component in the payroll report is consistent with moderate holiday spending during the period," said Keith Hembre, chief economist at FAF Advisors in Minneapolis. Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, but in recent years confidence measures have been a weak guide to actual spending. Stocks initially fell on the report, but later recouped losses. The dollar extended losses, with the euro rising 0.5 percent to $1.3350, while U.S. Treasuries showed little reaction. The survey's index of current conditions rose to 108.2 in December from 106.0 in November, while consumer expectations dipped to 78.6 from 83.2 in November. Consumers' expectations for increased inflation was little changed in December, the report said. The University of Michigan's preliminary December reading on one-year U.S. inflation expectations was 3.0 percent, unchanged from 3.0 percent in November. Median expectations for inflation over a five-year horizon nudged higher to 3.1 percent from 3.0 percent in November.
