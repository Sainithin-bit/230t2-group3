 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc. ( PFE.N ) on Friday said a Canadian federal court granted its request to prevent Novopharm Ltd. from launching a generic version of Pfizer's Lipitor cholesterol drug until a patent expires in July 2010. 

 The decision involving Lipitor, the world's top-selling drug, is subject to appeal, Pfizer said.
