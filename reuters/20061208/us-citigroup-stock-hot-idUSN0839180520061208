 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc. ( C.N ) shares rose as much as 4 percent on Friday, the stock's biggest gain in nearly eight months, amid speculation the No. 1 U.S. bank may sell some businesses and rumors about the future of its two top executives. 

 Citigroup declined to comment on the break-up speculation and denied persistent speculation that Chief Financial Officer Sallie Krawcheck would leave the bank, but declined to confirm if she will stay in her current role. "She is not leaving," a Citigroup spokesman said. The spokesman would not comment on news reports that Chief Executive Charles Prince could be replaced and that Bank of America Corp.'s ( BAC.N ) chief financial officer, Alvaro de Molina, was planning to join Citigroup. De Molina said this month he would resign as Bank of America CFO at the end of the year. He is supposed to help Bank of America in the transition with a new CFO through March. Citigroup stock climbed to $52.65 in early New York Stock Exchange trade, a $1.94 gain over Thursday's closing price. The stock closed more than 2 percent higher at $51.85. "There are rumors surrounding Citigroup that they are seriously considering breaking themselves up into different entities," said William Lefkowitz, an options strategist at brokerage firm vFinance Investments in New York. "If Citigroup pursued this strategy some believe the stock will move up to at least $60." Lefkowitz said this was evidenced by the strong activity in the December calls that give the right to buy Citigroup at $52.50 a share by December 15. Nearly 17,000 of these contracts traded in the U.S. options market in early Friday trade. But Richard Bove, analyst at Punk Ziegel & Co., dismissed talk of a Citigroup break-up. "This would be totally contrary to his (Prince's) public statements to this point," he said. "The last thing in the world you can imagine happening is this bank ... breaking itself up. It's not going to happen." Bove was also skeptical about the prospect of de Molina moving to Citigroup. Bank of America declined to comment.
