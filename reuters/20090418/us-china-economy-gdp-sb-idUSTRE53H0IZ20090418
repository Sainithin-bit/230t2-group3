 BOAO, China  (Reuters) - China's economy has hit bottom and growth is expected to pick up steam but it will not be easy to achieve the government's 8-percent target for full-year growth, a senior Communist Party adviser said on Saturday. 

 Zheng Xinli, vice head of the Party's policy research office, said economic data for the first quarter had demonstrated initial signs of the positive impact of Beijing's economic stimulus measures. "My sense is the economy hit bottom in the first quarter," Zheng told reporters on the sidelines of the Boao Forum for Asia. "The economy is expected to recover further in the second quarter, with GDP growth of 7 percent," he said. China this week posted its slowest quarterly growth on record for the first three months of 2008, at 6.1 percent, although recent urban fixed-asset investment and industrial output growth showed signs of picking up. Asked if the government would hit the 8-percent GDP growth target for the year, Zheng said: "I think it is not guaranteed." He did not elaborate. Zheng also said it would be in China's interests to take the financial crisis as an opportunity to alter its growth model by putting more emphasis on domestic demand and consumption, rather than relying heavily on overseas demand for its exports.
