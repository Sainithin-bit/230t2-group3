 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Kohl's Corp ( KSS.N ) is expected to announce on Tuesday a multi-year licensing pact with Fila Luxembourg S.a.r.l, a unit of Fila Korea Ltd., for a line of moderately priced activewear to be distributed exclusively at Kohl's, the Wall Street Journal reported in its online edition. 

 According to the Journal, the retailer says the new Fila Sport line will include clothing, hats and shoes for men, women and children. It will be rolled out next fall on Kohls.com and in the retailer's 929 stores in the U.S., the newspaper said. The line will be priced a little higher than the Fila pieces which Kohl's currently carries, the Journal said. Kohl's president Kevin Mansell told the Journal he expects the Fila Luxembourg line to boost the retailer's activewear business, which he said is likely to reach sales of $1.3 billion this year on a double-digit percentage growth rate. Representatives from Kohl's were not immediately available for comment. (Reporting by  Justin Grant )
