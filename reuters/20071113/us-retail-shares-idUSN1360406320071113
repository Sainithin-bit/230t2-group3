 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. retail stocks rallied on Tuesday amid a market-wide rise, as an upbeat forecast from Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ) signaled to some investors that the outlook for consumer spending might not be as bad as it seems. 

 Shares of Talbots Inc TLB.N, Aeropostale Inc ( ARO.N ), Hot Topic Inc HOTT.O and Jos. A. Bank Clothiers Inc ( JOSB.O ), were all up at least 8 percent. Tween Brands Inc TWB.N, Pacific Sunwear of California Inc ( PSUN.O ), Casual Male Retail Group Inc CMRG.O, New York & Co Inc ( NWY.N ) and Tiffany & Co. ( TIF.N ) were all up more than 5 percent. Retail analysts said Wal-Mart reporting quarterly profit ahead of Wall Street estimates and raising its full-year outlook aided a retail rally that had begun on Monday. Wal-Mart "suggested that consumer spending is not as doomed as some had feared," said Morningstar analyst Brady Lemos. "It looks like the holiday season, at least for them, isn't going to be a disaster." In addition, oil prices dropped over 3.5 percent on Tuesday after the International Energy Agency cut its forecast for world oil demand growth. Before the two-day rally, stocks on the Dow Jones U.S. General Retail Index .DJUSGT, which was up 3.7 percent late on Tuesday, had fallen 12 percent since October 11, when many retailers reported disappointing September same-store sales. The index was down 17 percent from July 13, when the U.S. Commerce Department reported that June retail sales posted their steepest drop in nearly two years. "This space has really taken a beating over the summer," said Needham & Co. analyst Christine Chen, adding that as of Friday, many retail stocks were trading at multiples of about 15 times estimated 2008 earnings. "That's really at the low end of the range this space trades at, unless you're in an actual recession," Chen said. She said retail stocks historically trade in a range of 15 to 19 times earnings. Jefferies analyst Timothy Allen called this a "relief rally" and said it could last until December, when retailers start looking out to the new year. "Once you start to focus on the new year again, I think that will be the catalyst for probably a bottom for the group," Allen said. "I wouldn't expect this to be the bottom," he said, adding that the economic difficulties springing from the housing slowdown and credit crunch should persist into 2008.
