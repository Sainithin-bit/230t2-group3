 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A measure of consumer confidence 
dropped to a two-year low in November, weighed down by housing 
market turmoil and surging oil prices, according to a survey 
released on Tuesday. 

  Investor's Business Daily and TechnoMetrica Market 
Intelligence said their IBD/TIPP economic optimism index dived 
to 43.8 from October's 47.3.  November's was the third-lowest reading in the series' 
nearly seven-year history, after those of September and October 
2005 in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.  A figure below 50 indicates pessimism, and November was the 
eighth straight month that the index was in pessimistic 
territory, IBD/TIPP said in a statement.  "Americans are spooked about the future," said Raghavan 
Mayur, president of TIPP, a unit of TechnoMetrica Market 
Intelligence, IBD's polling partner. "High fuel prices, rising 
retail prices and the mortgage crisis are also to blame."  There are concerns that the troubles in the housing market, 
which have resulted in credit-related losses and massive 
layoffs at U.S. financial institutions, could constrain 
consumers' ability to spend and crimp economic growth.  Declines were registered in two of the three key components 
of the index -- the six-month economic outlook and personal 
financial outlook, IBD/TIPP said.  About 924 adults were surveyed from November 2 to November 
8. The margin of error was plus or minus 3.3 percentage points.  (Reporting by  Lucia Mutikani ; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
