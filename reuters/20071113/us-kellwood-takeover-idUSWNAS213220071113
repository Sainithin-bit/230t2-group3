 (Reuters) - Sun Capital Securities Group LLC said it was considering making a hostile bid for Kellwood Co KWD.N at $21.00 per share in cash after the apparel maker's board rejected its offer. 

 The $21 a share offer represents a premium of about 27 percent to the stock's closing price of $16.51 Monday on the New York Stock Exchange. In a letter sent to the Kellwood board, Sun Capital said it could raise the entire purchase price from its on capital and the proposal did not have any financing contingency. However, Kellwood in a separate release on Tuesday, rejected the proposal, saying Sun Capital was "simply" reiterating the terms of its September 18 bid. Last month, Kellwood had rejected Sun Capital's unsolicited bid, saying the $544 million offer undervalued the company. In the letter, Sun Capital said it was concerned about Kellwood's fiscal 2008 outlook of 100 percent and excess year-over-year growth, as the company had a track record of performing below expectations. Responding to the letter, the Kellwood board said Sun's latest proposal significantly undervalued the strength of its brands and the opportunities for sales and earnings growth. Last week, Kellwood cut its sales and earnings forecasts for the third quarter and full year to exclude its sale of the Smart Shirt brand.
