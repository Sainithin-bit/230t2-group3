 WASHINGTON  Nov 13 (Reuters) - XM Satellite Radio Holdings
Inc XMSR.O said on Tuesday its shareholders voted to approve
a merger with rival Sirius Satellite Radio Inc ( SIRI.O ). 

  The vote by shareholders of XM, home to programming such as
Oprah Winfrey and Major League Baseball, came after Sirius
shareholders agreed earlier on Tuesday to issue more stock to
help pay for the deal.  The companies expect the deal, which has been challenged by
terrestrial radio broadcasters as anti-competitive, to be
completed this year. It must win approval from the U.S.
Department of Justice and the Federal Communications
Commission.
