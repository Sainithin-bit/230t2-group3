 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc ( C.N ), the largest U.S. bank, on Tuesday reorganized its investment banking unit, combining equity and debt underwriting and sales, and replacing its credit market chiefs as losses mount. 

 The changes come as Vikram Pandit, who took over investment banking last month following a management overhaul, puts his stamp on a unit suffering billions of dollars of losses from mortgages, leveraged loans and trading. The moves follow the resignation of Chairman and Chief Executive Charles Prince on November 4. That day, Citigroup also said it may write off $11 billion this quarter for subprime mortgages, potentially eliminating one-third of the bank's annual profit. "When mishaps occur, management often feels a necessity to restructure," said Michael Holland, founder of Holland & Co., a New York money manager that invests more than $4 billion. "It may or may not improve performance. Only time will tell. Citigroup and Wall Street have to get debt pricing issues behind them, and no one knows when this will happen." Citigroup's combined underwriting unit will be known as capital markets origination and be led by Tyler Dickson, who has been head of equity capital markets. Sales operations will be combined under an investor client group led by Antonio Cacorino, who was previously co-head of fixed-income sales and Jim O'Donnell, who was head of global distribution for equities. Chad Leat, who had overseen credit markets, will assume a senior role advising clients, oversee the leveraged finance pipeline, and assist Dickson on transitional issues. Mark Watson, the other credit markets chief, will also assist on transitional issues before taking a new job at the company. Dickson, Cacorino and O'Donnell will report to James Forese, the new co-chief executive of markets and banking, who announced the changes in an internal memo on Tuesday. Citigroup confirmed the memo's contents. It was not immediately clear whether the changes will result in job cuts. A Citigroup spokeswoman declined to comment. The status of Michael Mauer, whom Citigroup said led fixed-income sales with Cacorino, was also unclear. Shares of Citigroup rose nearly 3 percent, or 93 cents, to $34.50 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. They began the year at $55.70. FOLLOWING OTHER BANKS Citigroup joins other Wall Street banks, including Pandit's former employer Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) to combine equity and debt market operations. This can allow clients to be offered more products services at once, rather than have teams of bankers compete with each other for business. The changes "will more closely align our origination and sales functions across traditional product categories," Forese said in the memo. Other Citigroup investment bankers to give up their jobs in the last five weeks include trading chief Thomas Maheras and co-heads of fixed income Randy Barker and Geoffrey Coley. For the third quarter, Citigroup had reported $636 million of fixed-income trading losses, a roughly $1.83 billion write-down for mortgages and so-called collateralized debt obligations, and a $1.35 billion write-down for leveraged loans used to fund corporate buyouts. Pandit joined Citigroup in April when the bank bought his Old Lane Partners LP hedge fund for an estimated $800 million. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel; Editing by  Derek Caney )
