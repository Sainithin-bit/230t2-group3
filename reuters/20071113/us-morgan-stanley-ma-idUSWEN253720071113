 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) Chief Financial Officer Colm Kelleher on Tuesday said he sees merger and acquisition activity slowing next year from 2007 levels as the volume of big leveraged buyouts falls. 

 M&A activity will still be strong, he added, estimating they'd be closer to 2005 levels. (Reporting by  Joseph A. Giannone ; Editing by  Derek Caney )
