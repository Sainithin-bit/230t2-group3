 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. gift card sales could rise 6 percent to $26.3 billion this holiday as consumers, who may skimp on gifts for themselves, see the cards as a way to splurge once the holidays are over, according to a survey released on Tuesday by the National Retail Federation. 

 But the 6 percent expected growth in gift card sales is a moderation from last year, when consumers were expected to spend $24.8 billion on the cards -- up 34.1 percent from $18.5 billion in 2005. The slowing gift card sales growth comes as the NRF has already forecast that overall holiday sales will rise at their slowest pace in five years. The weak housing market and credit crunch are expected to temper consumer spending and sales at many U.S. retailers have been rising at a slower pace this year than a year ago as consumers crimp spending in the face of higher food and fuel costs. "Many consumers pulled back on spending for themselves this year and are hoping to receive a gift card so they can purchase something they may have had their eye on for months," said NRF President and CEO Tracy Mullin in a statement. The survey, conducted by BIGresearch for the National Retail Federation, found the average shoppers is expected to spend $122.59 on gift cards this year -- up from $116.51 in 2006, according to the survey. The survey polled 7,982 consumers from October 31 to November 7. The consumer poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 1.0 percent, the NRF said. (Reporting by Nicole Maestri)
