 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - DaimlerChrysler AG's DCX.N DCXGn.DE efforts to sell its U.S.-based Chrysler Group unit appear to have focused on private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management LP, the Detroit News reported on Saturday. 

 Citing people close to the sale process, the Detroit News reported the German auto maker has been in detailed talks with Cerberus CBS.UL rather than two other possible buyers, the Blackstone Group BG.UL and Magna International MGa.TO. A DaimlerChrysler spokesman declined to comment on the report. A representative of Cerberus could not immediately be reached for comment. The Detroit News also reported that DaimlerChrysler's management and supervisory boards were set to meet early next week in Germany and a decision could be made soon on a preferred buyer for Chrysler. The report runs contrary to recent reports that Canadian auto parts manufacturer Magna was a favored buyer for the struggling Chrysler unit. Magna has identified Canadian investment firm Onex Corp. ( OCX.TO ) as a partner in a potential acquisition and Magna Chairman Frank Stronach said Thursday the supplier would be open to DaimlerChrysler keeping a stake in Chrysler.
