 FRANKFURT  May 12 (Reuters) - Autoparts supplier Magna International MGa.TO and buyout firm Onex Corp. ( OCX.TO ), both of Canada, are planning to buy 40 percent each of carmaker DaimlerChrysler's DCXGn.DE Chrysler Group, a German magazine reported. 

 Germany-based DaimlerChrysler would keep a 20-percent stake, the WirtschaftsWoche business weekly reported, citing unnamed sources close to Magna's top management. DaimlerChrysler was created in 1998 through the merger of Germany's Daimler-Benz AG and U.S.-based Chrysler Corp. Its divisions include the Mercedes Car Group, Chrysler Group and the Truck Group. DaimlerChrysler has been meeting with potential buyers for the loss-making Chrysler unit, including Magna as well as private equity firms Cerberus Capital Management CBS.UL and Blackstone Group BG.UL, sources have told Reuters. Billionaire Kirk Kerkorian's investment arm, Tracinda Corp., has bid $4.5 billion for Chrysler.
