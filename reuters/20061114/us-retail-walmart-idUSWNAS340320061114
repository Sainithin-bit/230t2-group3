 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) said on Tuesday it would further cut prices on toys and games in its fourth set of markdowns aimed at spurring sales growth during the crucial holiday season. 

 Previously the company had reduced prices in categories including electronics and home appliances in the face of sluggish sales. Earlier in the day, the world's largest retailer posted a 11.5 percent rise in net income and Chief Executive Lee Scott vowed that the company's "most aggressive pricing strategy ever" would revive sales during the holiday. Wal-Mart shares rose as much as 4 percent to $48.20 on the New York Stock Exchange. Wal-Mart, which said the latest markdowns bring the total number of discounted toys to over 150, has been trying to reinvigorate growth after back-to-back months of disappointing sales. The company's more fashionable apparel line Metro 7 has not been a hit with shoppers, while remodeling projects have disrupted hundreds of U.S. stores. The company first said in October that it would lower prices on more than 100 key toys, such as Mattel Inc.'s MAT.N Hot Wheels Radar Gun at $20, down from $29.74, and the Monopoly Here & Now board game from Hasbro Inc. HAS.N, which will sell for $15 instead of $28.96. Earlier this month, Wal-Mart also announced price cuts on electronics such as plasma televisions and digital cameras, appliances such as microwaves and coffee makers, and a holiday clothing collection from Metro 7. On Tuesday, Wal-Mart said in a statement that it will continue to match competitors' prices on toys through December 31. Newly discounted toys include the Bratz Kids doll, marked down to $8.88 from $12.94, and the Superman Inflato Suit, reduced to $15 from $22.68. Shares of Wal-Mart were up $1.36, or almost 3 percent, or $47.68 in late-afternoon trading.
