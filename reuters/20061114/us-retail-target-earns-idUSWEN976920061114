 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Target Corp. ( TGT.N ) reported a bigger-than-expected 16 percent rise in quarterly profit on Tuesday and gave a confident outlook for the holiday season despite fierce competition from rival Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ). 

 The discount retailer, whose shares edged higher in morning trade, posted strong sales growth and hefty returns from its credit cards, and said it would likely meet Wall Street's expectations for fourth-quarter profits. Wal-Mart, the world's biggest retailer, has cut prices on key toys, electronics and small appliances, and vowed to be "relentless" in holiday season discounting. Gregg Steinhafel, Target's president, called Wal-Mart's markdowns "business as usual" and said his company would respond aggressively. "As we get deeper in the holiday season, we expect to experience more price cutting and then we will respond as quickly as we possibly can to make sure our prices are in line," he said on a conference call with analysts. Target earned $506 million, or 59 cents per share, in the third quarter ended on October 28, up from $435 million, or 49 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average expected 55 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Quarterly revenue rose 11.2 percent to $13.57 billion, with sales at stores open at least a year -- a key retail measure known as same-store sales -- up 4.6 percent. Earlier on Tuesday, Wal-Mart posted an 11.5 percent increase in profit, with U.S. same-store sales up 1.5 percent. CREDIT CARDS Target's sales growth has outpaced Wal-Mart's in recent quarters, in part because Target caters to wealthier shoppers who are less sensitive to economic factors such as rising energy costs. Target said its credit card business had contributed $176 million to earnings before taxes, up 63 percent from a year earlier. The retailer issues its owns Target and Target Visa credit cards, which have been big profit drivers. Lehman Brothers analyst Robert Drbul said the credit card earnings were better than he had expected. On the conference call, Target said credit delinquencies and write-offs had increased as expected after a recent regulation that increased minimum payments, but said delinquencies were likely at or near their peak. The retailer said fourth-quarter earnings would likely be in line with Wall Street expectations for $1.26 per share, with same-store sales growth in the mid-single digits. Shares of Target were up 28 cents, or 0.5 percent, at $58.04 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, while shares of Wal-Mart were up 2.3 percent to $47.40. Target shares, which are up about 5 percent for the year to date, trade at 16.3 times analysts' profit forecasts for next year, compared with a multiple of 14.4 for Wal-Mart.
