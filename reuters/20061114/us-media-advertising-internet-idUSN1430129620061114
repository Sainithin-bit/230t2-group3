 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Internet advertising revenue rose 33 percent in the third quarter to a record $4.2 billion, but showed more minimal growth on a consecutive quarterly basis, according to data released on Tuesday. 

 A report compiled by the Interactive Advertising Bureau and PricewaterhouseCoopers showed Web advertising rose 2 percent compared with the second quarter of 2006, even as the dollar amount spent was the largest ever for a single quarter. Investor concerns over slower growth rates even as more advertisers are spending money on the Web have weighed on Internet leaders like Yahoo Inc. and others. Internet media companies have responded by seeking higher-growth avenues on the Web, from social networking capabilities to new services created with traditional media, while still working to grow their base of marketers. "This growth follows the trend of where consumers are spending their media time and the unique ability of interactive advertising to effectively target and monitor ad campaigns," said David Silverman, a partner at PwC.
