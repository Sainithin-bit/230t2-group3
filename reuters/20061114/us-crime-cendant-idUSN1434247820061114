 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. government sued former Cendant Corp. CD.N Vice Chairman Kirk Shelton and several members of his family on Tuesday for nearly $40 million in fraudulently transferred assets. 

 Shelton was convicted of fraud in January 2005 and sentenced to 10 years in prison for his role in a decade-long accounting scheme that inflated earnings and stock values of Cendant, a real estate and travel company, and its predecessor CUC International. Former Cendant Chairman Walter Forbes was convicted last month for the scheme that -- when revealed in 1998 -- wiped $14 billion off Cendant's market value. It was one of a series of accounting scandals that shook the U.S. corporate world. Shelton was also ordered to pay nearly $3.3 billion in restitution, but he is currently free on bail as he appeals his conviction and sentence. Forbes is due to be sentenced in January. U.S. Attorney Christopher Christie, the chief federal prosecutor in New Jersey, said in a statement on Tuesday that authorities were determined to recover all the money stolen from shareholders. "The charges filed today describe a series of transactions through which Shelton established straw companies and transferred more than $22 million in personal assets to those companies within days of learning Cendant would be pursuing him for the billions of dollars of damages," Christie said. He also accused Shelton of transferring more than $5.5 million to his wife and other close family members. The government is seeking $37.8 million: $30 million in fraudulently transferred assets plus $7.8 million subsequently retransferred among other people named in the lawsuit. Shelton's wife, sister, two sons, niece, nephew and brother-in-law are also named in the lawsuit.
