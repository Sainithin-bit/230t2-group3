 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bootmaker Timberland Co. TBL.N is considering putting itself up for sale and has reached out to potential suitors in recent weeks, a source familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. 

 Timberland, whose shares were up 5.4 percent, has hired Goldman Sachs Group ( GS.N ) as its financial adviser, the source said. Timberland, which has a market capitalization of nearly $2 billion, and Goldman Sachs declined to comment on the matter. "The stock isn't necessarily cheap, so I don't know what that may mean for any prospective buyers, if there are out there," said Susquehanna Financial analyst Chris Svezia, who has a "neutral" rating on Timberland shares. "Even though the company has put out somewhat mixed results for the past quarter or so, the stock has moved up pretty appreciably," Svezia added. Any deal would need the approval of the Swartz family, which founded Timberland and controls all of its Class B shares, giving the family about 70 percent voting power. Statham, New Hampshire-based Timberland, whose fashion-oriented work boots have long been popular with young, urban consumers, has struggled recently as fashion trends have favored high-priced basketball shoes or low-cut European styles over boots. Timberland posted a 25 percent drop in profit for the third quarter. Its stock, which trades at 18.3 times expected 2007 earnings, has risen 14.7 percent since November 7 and is up nearly 33 percent from a 52-week low of $24.80 on July 21. The shares were up $1.68 to $32.68 in midday trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
