 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The chief executives of General Motors ( GM.N ), Ford Motor ( F.N ) and Chrysler Group said on Tuesday they discussed several competitive concerns with President George W. Bush during an hourlong meeting in the Oval Office. 

 "We told the president that we are very willing to make difficult decisions to transform our businesses to compete successfully, but we are not in a position to counter the effects of an excessively weak yen. "We asked the president to take action to address the weak yen," the companies said in a joint statement issued after the meeting.
