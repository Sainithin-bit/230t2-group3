 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Clothing and accessories retailer Eddie Bauer Holdings Corp. EBHI.O, which has accepted a $286 million takeover bid by two private equity firms, reported a wider third-quarter loss on Tuesday, hurt by lower sales and a one-time charge. 

 The loss widened to $197.6 million, or $6.58 per share, compared with a loss of $10 million, or 33 cents per share, a year earlier. Sales dropped about 3 percent to $211.3 million, and comparable-store sales declined 1.5 percent. It was the company's first quarterly results since a massive restructuring. Eddie Bauer has struggled to revive a brand that traces its roots back to 1920. The company is best known for outdoor-inspired clothing and accessories, but it has also licensed its name for products ranging from Ford Explorer trucks to baby strollers. The retailer operates some 375 stores, but analysts say it has had trouble setting itself apart from similar companies such as L.L. Bean and Sears Holdings Corp.'s ( SHLD.O ) Lands' End. In the proposed takeover, a company owned by affiliates of Sun Capital Partners Inc. and Golden Gate Capital will pay Eddie Bauer stockholders $9.25 per share. They will also assume $328 million of Eddie Bauer debt. (Additional reporting by Anthony Kurian in Bangalore)
