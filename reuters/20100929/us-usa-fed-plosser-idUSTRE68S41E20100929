 VINELAND, New Jersey  (Reuters) - Philadelphia Federal Reserve President Charles Plosser said on Wednesday that despite a slowing economic recovery, further Fed financial easing is unnecessary. 

 "Based on my current outlook, I do not support further asset purchases of any size at this time," he told a chamber of commerce lunch. The Fed said at its September meeting that inflation was lower than it likes and that it is prepared to act if necessary to support the recovery and to push inflation higher. Markets widely expect the Fed to announce another round of asset purchases as early as its next meeting in early November. Plosser acknowledged that growth has moderated, and that inflation has been subdued. However, he said he expects inflation expectations to remain stable and does not see a significant risk of sustained deflation. Core inflation in the range of 1 percent to 1-1/2 percent "is not a problem," he said. However, were deflationary expectations to materialize, Plosser said he would back aggressive asset buying to raise inflation expectations. Plosser said he opposes asset buying under current conditions because he worries policymakers would squander public confidence in the Fed's ability to combat deflationary expectations by acting prematurely. Also, he said, it is difficult to see how additional asset purchase could have much impact on the near-term outlook for unemployment. Plosser has been outspoken in expressing concern about the massive expansion of the Fed's balance sheet, which has doubled from pre-crisis levels as a result of recession-fighting efforts. The economic recovery continues on a sustainable path despite sings of a slower pace in the second half of the year, Plosser said. While unemployment is painfully high at 9.6 percent, business will only begin hiring again when they are comfortable with the recovery, he said. Consumption growth is also likely to be slow going forward as households adjust to declines in wealth, he added. (Reporting by  Mark Felsenthal ; Editing by  Andrea Ricci  and Andrew Hay)
