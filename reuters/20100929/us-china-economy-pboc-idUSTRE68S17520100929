 BEIJING  (Reuters) - China will increase the flexibility of the yuan and improve the way it manages the exchange rate with reference to a basket of currencies of the country's trading partners, the central bank said on Wednesday. 

 The statement of intent came ahead of an expected vote by the House of Representatives on a bill that would let the United States impose duties on goods from countries with undervalued currencies. "We will further improve the yuan's exchange rate formation mechanism, let market supply and demand play a key role in its adjustment with reference to a basket of currencies and increase exchange rate flexibility," the central bank said in a summary of the third-quarter meeting of its monetary policy committee. The People's Bank of China, which keeps a tight grip on the yuan, let the currency rise as high as 6.6825 per dollar on Wednesday. The yuan has now gained almost 2.2 percent against the dollar since Beijing scrapped a 23-month-old peg to the dollar on June 19 and said it would let the currency resume a managed float. Nearly all of the increase has occurred this month, coinciding with mounting U.S. pressure on Beijing to permit a faster rise in a currency that International Monetary Fund economists estimate is 5-27 percent undervalued. The yuan has now risen 24 percent against the dollar since July 2005, but U.S. lawmakers say Chinese exporters still have an unfair currency advantage in global markets. China retorts that its big trade surplus with United States comes about because Americans save too little and no longer make the goods China sells. The PBOC's 15-member policy committee, chaired by Governor Zhou Xiaochuan, advises on the level of the yuan and of interest rates, but key decisions are subject to approval by the cabinet. The central bank reaffirmed its long-standing "appropriately loose" monetary policy stance and said the economy was growing as it expected. "The overall performance of China's economy is sound, and it continues to head in the expected direction in line with macro economic adjustments," the central bank said. "But managing inflation expectations and maintaining relatively fast economic growth while adjusting the structure of the economy remains an arduous task," it added. Beijing has been steadily reeling in breakneck anti-crisis bank lending, curbing property speculation and closing down old, energy-guzzling factories. However, a survey released on Wednesday showed that overall growth remains robust, supported by fast-rising incomes and capital spending on infrastructure such as roads and railways. The PBOC said the world economy was on the path of recovery but was laboring under serious structural burdens. (Reporting by Aileen Wang and Kevin Yao; Editing by  Alan Wheatley  and Neil Fullick)
