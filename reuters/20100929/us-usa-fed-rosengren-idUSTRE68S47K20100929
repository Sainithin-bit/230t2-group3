 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve should respond "vigorously" and "creatively" to a serious economic problem of high unemployment, too-low inflation and slow growth, a top Fed official said on Wednesday. 

 Boston Federal Reserve Bank President Eric Rosengren's remarks make the strongest argument so far for more monetary easing after the U.S. central bank last week opened the door to the possibility. "In my view, current economic conditions -- an unemployment rate near 10 percent, sluggish growth, and undesirably low inflation -- together constitute a serious economic problem," Rosengren said in remarks prepared for delivery to a conference in New York. In a speech titled, "How should monetary policy respond to a slow recovery?" he said his answer was "vigorously, creatively, thoughtfully, and persistently, as long as we have options at our disposal. And we do have options." Rosengren disagreed with the argument -- made by more inflation-focused hawks -- that a key part of the jobless problem is a mismatch between workers' skills and jobs available, which monetary policy is not best placed to address. Instead, he said, businesses are holding back hiring because they are not seeing enough demand for their products. "If they were confident that demand would pick up, they would -- and easily could -- hire," he said. Rosengren said the economy is growing too slowly to either significantly reduce the unemployment rate or stem disinflationary pressures. The Fed cut interest rates to near zero in December 2008 and has kept them there since. It also bought $1.7 trillion in mortgage-related assets and Treasury bonds to further drive down borrowing costs. The Fed said last week it is prepared to provide additional accommodation to support the economic recovery if needed. Markets expect more Treasuries purchases before year-end. Talk of more quantitative easing have undermined the dollar, which has lost nearly 5 percent against the euro in recent weeks and is adding to a flood of cash into emerging markets as investors search for yield. DEFLATION RISK The closer a "too-low" rate of inflation gets to zero, Rosengren said, the greater the risk it could slide into a harmful downward price spiral known as deflation. "My firm view is that it is important that policymakers be open to implementing policies consistent with achieving full employment, and an appropriate level of inflation, within a reasonable time frame," he said. Rosengren, who has a vote on the Fed's policy-setting panel this year, is one of the more dovish Fed officials with a darker economic outlook than some of his peers. Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Dennis Lockhart, who is seen as a centrist, said on Tuesday that he had yet to make up his mind on whether more easing was needed. Rosengren said that a challenge of unconventional policies is that the benefits are harder to track than the costs. Costs of purchases include exposing the Fed to interest rate risk, complicating the Fed's eventual exit from accommodative policies, he said. Treasury purchases could also give investors the wrong impression that the Fed is using monetary policy to finance fiscal deficits, he added. While these are concerns the Fed must weigh and mitigate, he said, "we cannot take lightly how far off the mark unemployment and inflation seem to be." An expansion of reserves in the financial system through more bond buying "might serve as an effective signal that highlights the determination of the Federal Reserve to reduce disinflationary pressures," he said. But, he said, the goal of purchases is "to stimulate the economy by reducing long-term interest rates to a level that is more consistent with where they would be, were we able to further reduce the federal funds rate." Rosengren said the primary impact on the economy of the $1.7 trillion mostly mortgage-related Fed purchases was a reduction in mortgage rates. (Editing by  Padraic Cassidy )
