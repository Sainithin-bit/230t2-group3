 BERLIN  (Reuters) - Palladium is likely to lure investors more than platinum, based on the large growth potential of the Chinese car market, a more limited supply outlook for the metal and its inherent volatility. 

 Industry experts, speaking at the London Bullion Market Association annual conference, offered an upbeat outlook for both major platinum group metals (PGM), but singled out palladium as having more room for price gains. Palladium, mainly used in auto-catalysts to cut emissions, is showing its best performance against platinum in about six years due to its reliance on the vehicle market in China, where cars are almost exclusively powered by gasoline. Catalysts in diesel engines tend to take a higher loading of platinum, while palladium is more abundant in catalysts for gasoline engines. "The investor community is more favorable toward palladium over platinum. If you go to put a trade on in the PGM space, your first port of call is obviously platinum, but the question is how do we get more juice, and the answer is palladium," Michael Jansen, a strategist for JPMorgan Chase, said. Rapidly-dwindling stocks of palladium held above ground, together with slowing output from top producer Russia will put more pressure on supply of the metal than for platinum, where expectations are for a rise in production, especially in major miner South Africa. "Investors love owning assets where there is supply risk," Jansen said. "One of the things to stand out to us (is that) palladium production in two or three years probably isn't going to be much higher in South Africa and Russia to where it was in 2006 and 2007, while the outlook for platinum looks a little more upbeat. "Ultimately, the price outlook is helped by the fact that it has traded considerably higher before," he added. MORE ROOM TO RALLY Palladium has risen by more than 30 percent this year to above $550 an ounce and is holding around two-year highs but remains below the record peaks above $1,000 an ounce of 2001. Platinum meanwhile has risen by 9.6 percent this year to around $1,600 an ounce. Emma Townshend, an analyst with Renaissance Capital BJM, said these two had to be examined together with the performance of fellow PGM rhodium and of South Africa's rand currency. "The key in terms of forecasting prices is looking at the basket of platinum, palladium, rhodium and the rand," she said. "In view of our strong rand, I think we have relatively high prices. We definitely see, at these levels, the most upside to rhodium ... we see a lot of upside in palladium," she said, adding she expected rhodium to reach $3,000 an ounce in the coming twelve months, up from $2,225 currently. Townshend said she expected palladium prices to rise to $700 to $800 an ounce, while platinum would get up "to the high teens." David Jollie, a precious metals analyst for Mitsui, said China, the largest and fastest-growing car market in the world, would be a major driver for palladium demand. Jollie said vehicle production in China is expected to reach 17 million units this year, and perhaps even higher. "They're all gasoline, so again, it's a palladium story. That is part of the reason you see outperformance of palladium over platinum," he said. (Editing by Anthony Barker)
