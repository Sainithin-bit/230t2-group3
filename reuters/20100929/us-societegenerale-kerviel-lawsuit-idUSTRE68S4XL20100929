 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Societe Generale won the dismissal of a U.S. shareholder lawsuit accusing the French bank of concealing nearly 7 billion euros of losses from a massive trading scandal and exposure to subprime mortgages. 

 Judge Richard Berman of the federal court in Manhattan said the dismissal was compelled by a June ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court that restricted investors' ability to sue in U.S. courts over purchases of securities on foreign exchanges. Shareholders had accused Societe Generale, former Chief Executive Daniel Bouton and other officials of ignoring dozens of warnings about rogue trader Jerome Kerviel, whose activities led to a loss of 4.9 billion euros ($6.68 billion) in January 2008. They said the bank also hid its holdings in residential mortgage securities and collateralized debt obligations, and should have taken greater losses before posting a 2.05 billion euro ($2.79 billion) writedown the same month. They also said insiders were selling shares while knowing of these problems. The case is In re: Societe Generale Securities Litigation, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 08-2495. (1 euro = US$1.363) (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel; editing by John Wallace)
