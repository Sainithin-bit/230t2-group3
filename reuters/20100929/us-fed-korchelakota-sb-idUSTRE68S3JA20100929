 LONDON  (Reuters) - Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Narayana Kocherlakota on Wednesday said he did not see much impact on inflationary expectations from any possible, additional monetary easing measures. 

 Speaking in London, he also said that quantitative easing was not a tool the U.S. central bank would be contemplating if it could lower interest rates. "The effects of any QE are likely to be quite muted on inflation expectations," Kocherlakota said in response to a question at a forum. Kocherlakota, who will rotate into a voting seat on the Fed's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee next year, added that quantitative easing was not a tool that is as effective as lowering interest rates.
