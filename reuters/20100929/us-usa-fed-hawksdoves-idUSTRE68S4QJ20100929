 (Reuters) - U.S. Federal Reserve officials disagree on the desirability of more monetary easing and the future path of economic recovery, complicating Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke's task of achieving a consensus if he decides further action is warranted. 

 The Fed last week said it is prepared to provide more support to the economy if needed to bolster a slowing economic recovery and nudge up inflation that is below target. The following is a look at where each Fed policymaker appears to stand in the unfolding debate: THE CENTRISTS Seen as unlikely to dissent if Bernanke decides to push for further easing, but they will want to hear a convincing argument: FED GOVERNOR KEVIN WARSH (permanent voter) Warsh had been closely linked to centrist views on risks to the recovery but last fall showed some hawkish feathers by suggesting the Fed may have to tighten policy aggressively before clear signs emerge of an entrenched economic upturn. Analysts say he is uncomfortable about more easing. FED GOVERNOR ELIZABETH DUKE (permanent voter) In public remarks, Duke tends to focus more on regulatory issues than on the broader economy, making her monetary leanings somewhat of a question mark. However, she is said to have expressed reservations about the Fed's August 10 decision to reinvest into government bonds proceeds from maturing mortgage-backed securities the central bank holds. CLEVELAND FED PRESIDENT SANDRA PIANALTO (2010 voter) Analysts view Pianalto as a centrist. In recent speeches she has focused on the U.S. economy's difficult slog. ATLANTA FED PRESIDENT DENNIS LOCKHART (2012 voter) "There is growing sentiment that further accommodation through large asset purchases is coming," he said on September 28. "For me, at this moment it's not a foregone conclusion that we need to go there. Lockhart had said on Sept 3. that he would not rule out further Fed easing if conditions proved weaker than he was forecasting [ID:nN0398698] ST. LOUIS FED PRESIDENT JAMES BULLARD (2010 voter) Bullard was assumed to be an anti-inflation hawk when he took the helm of the St. Louis Fed in April 2008, but on July 29, he warned that the United States could fall into a Japan-style quagmire of falling prices. He has been a proponent of using quantitative easing as a monetary policy tool, but on September 10 he told The Wall Street Journal that he did not think further action would be necessary. THE DOVES More likely to think the benefits of more easing outweigh the costs, they see quantitative easing as a monetary policy tool like any other: NEW YORK FED PRESIDENT WILLIAM DUDLEY (permanent voter) Dudley, a former Goldman Sachs chief economist, was previously head of the New York Fed's markets group where he played a leading role in creating crisis-fighting tools. "The road to recovery is turning out to be a bit bumpy as relatively weak consumer spending and the ongoing problems in financial markets are keeping growth far less robust than we would like," he said on July 22. SAN FRANCISCO FED PRESIDENT JANET YELLEN (2012 voter) Analysts see Yellen as firmly in the pro-easing camp. "With unemployment still painfully high, job creation must be a high priority of monetary policy," she said on July 15. Yellen has been nominated to be vice chairman of the Fed board; if the Senate approves the nomination, she would join the ranks of permanent voters. BOSTON FED PRESIDENT ERIC ROSENGREN (2010 voter) Rosengren tends to favor a looser policy stance. "Monetary policy should respond to a slow recovery vigorously, creatively, thoughtfully, and persistently, as long as we have options at our disposal. And we do have options," he said on September 29. "In my view, current economic conditions -- an unemployment rate near 10 percent, sluggish growth, and undesirably low inflation -- together constitute a serious economic problem. FED GOVERNOR DANIEL TARULLO (permanent voter) A finance lawyer by training, Tarullo is in charge of the Fed's bank supervisory function. "The relatively modest pace of recovery, the continued high rate of unemployment, subdued inflation trends, and well-anchored inflation expectations together suggest that the need for highly accommodative monetary policies will not diminish soon," Tarullo said on April 8. CHICAGO FED PRESIDENT CHARLES EVANS (2011 voter) Evans has expressed concerns about the weakening recovery. "A double-dip (recession) is not the most likely outcome but I am concerned about how strong the recovery will be," he said on August 24. THE HAWKS It would take a greater risk of deflation or a financial system shock to get these Fed officials on board: MINNEAPOLIS FED PRESIDENT NARAYANA KOCHERLAKOTA (2011 voter) Kocherlakota has warned that more easing would not fix the U.S. jobless problem, which he sees as being in large part structural. On September 29, he voiced further skepticism on the potential economic impact of further quantitative easing "My own guess is that further uses of QE would have a more muted effect on Treasury term premia," compared with the effect of Fed asset buying in 2009, he said. PHILADELPHIA FED PRESIDENT CHARLES PLOSSER (2011 voter) Plosser is opposed to more easing, he said on September 29. "Based on my current outlook, I do not support further asset purchases of any size at this time," he said. RICHMOND FED PRESIDENT JEFFREY LACKER (2012 voter) Lacker said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal on September 14 that if inflation fell in a way that suggested a risk of sustained declines in the price level, he would be willing to seriously consider further quantitative easing. He added, however, the economy seemed fairly far from that right now. KANSAS CITY FED PRESIDENT THOMAS HOENIG (2010 voter) Hoenig has used all five of his votes in 2010 to dissent against maintaining the Fed's pledge to hold rates "exceptionally low" for "an extended period," arguing rock bottom rates could set the stage for another dangerous boom-and-bust cycle. "I believe that zero rates during a period of modest growth are a dangerous gamble," he said on August 13. DALLAS FED PRESIDENT RICHARD FISHER (2011 voter) Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Richard Fisher told Reuters in an interview on September 8 that in his view, only a financial system shock or some other unforeseen circumstance should push the Fed into doing more. "The real issue in my opinion now is, are we pushing on a string with accommodation?" [ID:nN08136421]
