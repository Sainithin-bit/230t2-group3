 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Department store chain Kohl's Corp ( KSS.N ) said it is creating 4,000 jobs as it opens 21 U.S. stores and a new customer service center this fall. 

 The stores will bring nearly 3,000 jobs to 15 states, ranging from California to New York, the company said in a statement on Wednesday. The San Antonio, Texas-based customer service center, which recently hired about 200 associates, will create more than 1,000 jobs over the next three years.
