 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve will disclose by December 1 details of emergency credit programs enacted in the midst of the financial crisis, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said in testimony obtained by Reuters on Wednesday. 

 The remarks were prepared for delivery to the Senate Banking Committee, which is holding a hearing on Thursday with Bernanke and five other top regulators to discuss implementation of the Dodd-Frank regulatory reform rules. (Editing by  James Dalgleish )
