 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The vote on a U.S. congressional bill that would treat China's currency as a subsidy is set to take place early on Wednesday afternoon, a key lawmaker said. 

 "I would expect this to be up between 1:30 and 2," said Sander Levin, chairman of House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee. There are other bills on the House floor that might delay the vote slightly, congressional sources said. (Reporting by  Doug Palmer )
