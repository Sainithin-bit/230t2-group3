 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A bill passed on Wednesday by the House of Representatives reflects the serious concern throughout the government about China's currency practices, a Treasury Department spokeswoman said. 

 "Today's vote clearly shows lawmakers have serious concerns about this issue. The president and Secretary Geithner share those concerns. They both have said repeatedly that China needs to allow a significant, sustained appreciation over time," the spokeswoman said in a statement. (Reporting by  Doug Palmer ; Editing by Leslie Adler)
