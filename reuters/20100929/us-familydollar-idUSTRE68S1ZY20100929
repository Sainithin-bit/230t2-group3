 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Family Dollar Stores Inc ( FDO.N ) said on Wednesday it would speed up the pace of new store openings and overhaul more of its existing stores, actions that analysts said should help it compete in the increasingly crowded dollar-store segment. 

 The company, which sells most of its merchandise for under $10, also forecast fiscal year earnings above most analysts' estimates and its shares rose 2.3 percent. The plans helped ease investors' concerns that the company's sales would suffer in coming months as it goes up against tough year-earlier comparisons and as unemployment remains high. "We look for same-store sales to rise about 5 percent in (fiscal 2011), supported by expected payoff from Family Dollar's multiple sales-driving initiatives, including an aggressive store renovation program," S&P Equity research analyst Jason Asaeda said in a note to clients. Dollar stores became more popular during the recession, when retailers added more everyday items like food. The chains have even taken some shoppers away from discount leader Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ), partly because dollar stores sell smaller sizes of some items, such as quarts of milk instead of gallons. Family Dollar expects to increase sales through longer store hours, introduced earlier this year, and by creating more shelf space for fast-moving items like food. The company posted a fourth-quarter profit on Wednesday that beat analysts' estimates and said it had authorized a new $750 million share repurchase. It said the repurchase would lower its cost of capital. Family Dollar faces pressure from activist investor Nelson Peltz to improve shareholder value. Peltz's Trian fund group has a 6.6 percent stake in the company. The accelerated store expansion, share repurchase plan and a forecast of a 5 percent to 7 percent increase in same-store sales for the current quarter were welcomed by analysts. "Family Dollar continues to be our dollar store of choice, given the significant opportunity the company has to narrow the productivity gap that exists with Dollar General," said JPMorgan retail analyst Charles Grom. Dollar General Corp ( DG.N ) shares closed down 0.77 percent or 23 cents, at $29.53 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday. Family Dollar shares closed up 1.63 percent, or 71 cents, at $44.05 per share. TOO MUCH GROWTH? There was some concern among more bearish analysts that the store expansions could hurt the company down the road. "An over-extension might lead to cannibalization of existing stores," Morningstar analyst Zoe Tan said. Morningstar has a $33 fair value target for the stock based on the expectation that consumers will trade up from dollar stores when the economy improves, that competition in the sector is fierce and that stores like Wal-Mart and Target Corp ( TGT.N ) will find ways to divert traffic away from dollar stores. Tan said there are better uses of cash than a share repurchase, including paying higher dividends. Family Dollar said it planned to open 300 new stores during fiscal 2011, up 50 percent from fiscal 2010, which ended on August 28. Most of the expansion will be where the company already operates, but some could also be on the West Coast toward the beginning of fiscal 2012. Family Dollar forecast fiscal 2011 earnings of $2.95 to $3.15 a share. Analysts on average forecast $2.96 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income in the June-August quarter was $74.0 million, or 56 cents a share, compared with $60.1 million, or 43 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts, on average, were looking for 51 cents a share before one-time items, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Earlier this month, Family Dollar said sales rose 8 percent to $1.96 billion during the quarter. Sales at stores open at least a year rose 6.1 percent.
