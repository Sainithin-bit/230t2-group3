 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Car rental company Avis Budget Group Inc CAR.N said on Wednesday it would be willing to include a break-up fee in its offer for Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group DTG.N if rival Hertz Global Holdings ( HTZ.N ) walks away from its own takeover bid for Dollar Thrifty. 

 Dollar Thrifty shareholders are due to vote on Hertz's roughly $1.5 billion offer on Thursday, and Hertz has said it would end its courtship of the business if it is turned down. "Avis Budget has always said that as long as Hertz had matching rights, Avis Budget would not consider a reverse termination fee," Avis said in a statement. "Now that Hertz has in effect eliminated those matching rights, Avis Budget is prepared to offer such fee." Reverse termination fees are paid to the target company if the acquiring company is unable to close the deal. If shareholders vote down the Hertz deal, Avis Budget said it would be prepared to offer a reverse termination fee of $20 million. Hertz included a $44.6 million reverse termination fee in its deal to buy Dollar Thrifty. Hertz and Avis have been sparring over Dollar Thrifty, one of the few major car rental companies to post a profit in 2009, since Hertz agreed to buy the company in April. Hertz and Dollar Thrifty agreed to a sweetened deal earlier this month, currently worth about $50.95 a share. Avis Budget has a higher bid on the table, but Dollar Thrifty's board has stood by the Hertz deal, citing worries about Avis's ability to get antitrust approval. Dollar Thrifty has also cited Avis' refusal to pay a reverse termination fee as a reason for rejecting the company's bid. Companies that offer cheap car rentals like Dollar Thrifty have become increasingly important in the rental industry as consumers try to save money. Dollar Thrifty's management has recommended that shareholders approve the Hertz bid, but one of its top shareholders, PAR Capital Management, plans to vote no, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday. Dollar Thrifty shares closed down 19 cents at $50.10 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday. (Reporting by  Michael Erman  and  Bijoy Koyitty ; editing by Gunna Dickson)
