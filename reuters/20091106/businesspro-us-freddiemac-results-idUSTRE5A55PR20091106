 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Freddie Mac FRE.N FRE.P, the second largest provider of U.S. residential mortgage funding, said on Friday it lost $5 billion in the third quarter and predicted it would require further support from the Treasury amid a "prolonged deterioration" in housing. 

 Increases in the value of securities it held over the quarter helped buoy its net worth, however, preventing it from need to tap government funds to stay solvent. After a $1.3 billion dividend payment on senior preferred stock bought by the Treasury in previous quarters, Freddie Mac's loss was $6.3 billion. Freddie Mac's loss comes amid a rise in provisions for credit losses to $7.6 billion in the quarter, up 46 percent compared with the second quarter, as delinquencies worsened on loans it guarantees. Shares of Freddie Mac were flat at $1.23 in light after-hours trading after the results.
