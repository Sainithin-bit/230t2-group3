 (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department's $700 billion financial rescue fund has about $142 billion not yet allocated, according to a Congressional Budget Office report released this week. 

 The Treasury, in its most recent report covering transactions from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, said that it has disbursed a net $367 billion. The transaction report covered investments and repayments through June 23. Following is an outline of funds spent or pledged from the U.S. bailout fund so far: -- An unspecified amount pledged to recapitalize some of the country's largest banks, if needed, in the wake of regulatory "stress tests." Regulators required 10 of the 19 banks tested to raise a combined $74.6 billion. -- The Treasury has allotted $100 billion to seed its public-private plan to buy up to $500 billion worth of toxic assets. The figure includes $25 billion to expand the Federal Reserve's Term Asset-Backed Loan Facility, or TALF, to accept so-called legacy assets as collateral. -- In its latest transaction report, the Treasury said it had net investments of $129.44 billion under its original Capital Purchase Program, which was initially pegged at $250 billion. This figure reflects repayments of $68 billion made by 10 of the largest U.S. banks on June 17. -- $50 billion pledged to reduce mortgage foreclosures by providing incentives to lenders and servicers to modify loans. It has allocated $17.69 billion in potential incentives to 20 firms so far. -- $20 billion investment in Citigroup ( C.N ) as part of a package in which the government agreed to share in losses on $301 billion of assets. In addition, the Treasury has disbursed $5 billion as part of its second-loss guarantee. The $20 billion is in addition to $25 billion disbursed as part of the Capital Purchase Program. -- $20 billion investment in Bank of America ( BAC.N ) as part of a package in which the government agreed to share in losses on $118 billion of assets. In addition, the Treasury has pledged to cover up to $7.5 billion in potential losses as part of a second-loss guarantee. The $20 billion is in addition to $25 billion disbursed as part of the Capital Purchase Program. -- $69.84 billion preferred stock investment in troubled insurer American International Group ( AIG.N ). This was reduced by $165 million from an earlier commitment, representing the amount of controversial bonuses paid by AIG in March. -- $79.97 billion has been disbursed to the U.S. auto industry, including bankruptcy financing and other loans to GM and Chrysler LLC, $5 billion in support for auto parts suppliers, and a $12.5 billion investment in GMAC LLC. Of the total amount, the department said it made available up to $30.10 billion in bankruptcy financing for General Motors GMGMQ.PK on June 3. -- $20 billion has been shifted to a special purpose vehicle to cover potential losses on $200 billion in lending under the Fed's TALF. Treasury officials say they intend to provide an additional $35 billion to enlarge this program for lending against recently originated securities. When considered in conjunction with the $25 billion being set aside to expand TALF to cover older securities, the Treasury has said it intends to commit $80 billion to TALF. -- $15 billion pledged to purchase securities backed by Small Business Administration loans.
