 PARIS  (Reuters) - Fiat CEO Sergio Marchionne is meeting German ministers on Monday as part of an ambitious bid to create a European auto giant, by taking over General Motors' European assets. 

 The bold move comes less than a week after he secured a last-minute deal for a partnership with U.S.-based Chrysler LLC. Here are some possible outcomes: FIAT WINS, SPINS OFF CORE OPERATIONS Fiat's CEO wants to spin off the Italian group's core car business into a separate company along with Chrysler and GM Europe and list it, creating a company with around 80 billion euros in revenues and sales of 6-7 million units per year. The new company, which the Financial Times said could also include GM's Latin American operations, would be the world's second-biggest carmaker, said UniCredit analysts. Talk of a spin off has been well received by the market. "The spinoff of the auto group has always been an option prized by the market because it brings out the stand-alone value of the auto business without the built-in discount that comes from a conglomerate like Fiat," Serge Escude, analyst with Cassa Lombarda, said. FIAT WINS; SYNERGIES, STATE SUPPORT Part of GM's plan to spin off Opel, along with UK-based Vauxhall Motors, includes finding an investor to unlock the 3.3 billion euros in state guarantees it is seeking. Marchionne said he would ask the British government and administrations in other European countries where Fiat and Opel have plants to offer loan guarantees. Marchionne said the deal would generate synergies of 1 billion euros per year. Crucially, the Opel deal would give Marchionne the scale he believes Fiat needs to survive the crisis. He said late last year that carmakers needed to produce at least 5.5 million vehicles a year to be in with a chance of making money. "We would expect a lot of political interference on an Opel deal but in order to gain consensus Fiat strategy should be to use the existing capacity in Germany to increase economies of scale," UniCredit analysts told clients. Analysts are confident in Marchionne's ability to oversee cost-cuts, after his turnaround of Fiat. FIAT LOSES; OPEL'S RIVAL SUITORS If Marchionne's plan is blocked, other players are interested in Opel. Mediobanca analysts see more union support for a deal with car parts maker Magna than with Fiat - but Magna's lack of car-making experience could be key. "Magna, in fact, is not a carmaker, doesn't manage brands on its own and has never overviewed a dealer distribution network," the analysts said. The leader of Opel's works council, Klaus Franz, said last week that other investors were interested in the unit and he was opposed to Fiat investing in Opel. Russian carmaker GAZ has been linked by media reports to Opel but repeatedly denied it is interested. Singaporean and Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds have also been cited, as well as U.S. private equity firm Cerberus. FIAT LOSES; UNION PRESSURE The most forceful opposition to a deal is likely to come from German and Italian unions, which fear job cuts and plant closures. Nomura International analyst Michael Tyndall agreed: "Industrial logic-wise, Opel makes a lot more sense than Chrysler. The big hurdle we can see is social cost," he said. "It's all very well to say they compete broadly in the same markets with similar platforms and there may be economies of scale. But the broad translation of 'economies of scale' is 'fewer jobs' and I'm not sure if the Italian or German governments have the appetite for the job losses a merger would entail," he added. FIAT WINS; LIABILITIES WEIGH If a deal does go ahead, Marchionne will have to work hard to prove he has not bitten off more than he can chew. Analysts who cautioned that pursuing Chrysler and Opel in tandem would be a tall order recognize that Marchionne is known for his dynamic nature and ability to pull of complicated deals. But combining the three brands would be no mean feat. "The new auto business comes with large liabilities," Bernstein analysts told clients, noting that the United Autoworkers Union will own 55 percent of Chrysler, with the level of ongoing healthcare liabilities still unclear. Opel will come with 4 billion euros of pension liabilities and Fiat Auto also has a material pension liability, the analysts said. "Given the loss-making status of all three parts of the combination, the new Auto business will need cash injections to be viable -- take out Brazil and Fiat Auto is loss-making. Will the new business have any equity value?" (Reporting by  Ian Simpson , Claudia Cristoferi,  Gilles Castonguay ; Writing by Helen Massy-Beresford; editing by Simon Jessop)
