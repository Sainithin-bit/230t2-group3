 BERLIN  (Reuters) - German Economy Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg said he did not expect a final decision on the future of carmaker Opel to come out of his meeting on Monday with Fiat SpA's chief executive. 

 "Today I just hope that I hear something more concrete than the rough concept that has already been presented to me," Guttenberg told Deutschlandfunk radio on Monday. Guttenberg said he was "completely open to any (potential) investor," adding that he was looking for a solid long-term strategy. Fiat is set on acquiring Opel after it struck a last-minute deal to buy an initial 20 percent of Chrysler on Thursday, just ahead of the deadline imposed by the Obama administration to cement a partnership. Fiat Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne will be in Berlin on Monday to meet Guttenberg and Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the chancellor candidate for the Social Democrats in September's election who has spearheaded the government's efforts to keep Opel alive. Aside from Fiat, Austrian-Canadian car parts maker Magna has also expressed interest in Opel. GM unit Opel, hit by a slump in demand due to the global downturn, has four plants in Germany and employs about 25,000 workers here. Thousands more jobs at suppliers are at stake.
