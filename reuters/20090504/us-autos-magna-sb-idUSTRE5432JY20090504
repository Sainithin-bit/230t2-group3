 (Reuters) - Austrian-Canadian auto parts supplier Magna International has presented the German government with a draft proposal to take control of General Motors' struggling German unit Opel. 

 The offer would rival that of Italy's Fiat, which is trying to establish an automotive empire combining its core car business with the European operations of GM and U.S. carmaker Chrysler. Here are some facts about Magna International: * Set up by Frank Stronach, a working-class Austrian migrant, in Canada, the company was known as Multimatic until merging with Magna Electronics in 1969, when it adopted its current name. * Now a billionaire, hardcore soccer fan Stronach controls the majority of voting rights in the company, which has no other major strategic investors. * Headquartered in the Canadian province of Ontario with a European office in Oberwaltersdorf, Austria, Magna is the world's third-largest auto parts supplier in terms of revenues after Denso and Robert Bosch. * The troubled auto market hit Magna hard in 2008 as profits dropped 90 percent to $71 million. * Magna, which employs 74,350, supplies car parts and assembled vehicles to major carmakers in the United States and Canada. * It does not produce goods under its own name but for suppliers such as Mercedes-Benz, Chrysler, Saab and BMW. It has been producing the Mercedes-Benz M-Class since 1999 and has teamed up with Ford Motor Co to bring a lithium-ion battery-powered car to the market by 2011.
