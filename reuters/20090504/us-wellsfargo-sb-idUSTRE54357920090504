 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. regulators asked Wells Fargo to raise capital, after "stress tests" showed the fourth-largest U.S. bank would struggle to survive a deeper recession, the Associated Press reported on Monday citing two people familiar with the matter. 

 A Wells Fargo representative declined to comment. Wells Fargo is one of the 19 U.S. banks undergoing a government "stress test" designed to ensure they each have sufficient capital to withstand a deep recession. The results are expected to be released on Thursday. The San Francisco-based bank -- in which Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc is the largest shareholder -- took $25 billion of capital from the government's Troubled Asset Relief Program last fall. While Wells Fargo said when it accepted the TARP money that it did not need the funds, its capital ratios are now lower than those of many rivals. On December 31, Wells Fargo bought Wachovia Corp for $12.5 billion, and immediately wrote down $37.2 billion of riskier Wachovia loans. Wells Fargo's Tier-1 capital ratio, including the $25 billion, ended March at 8.28 percent, above the 6 percent regulatory minimum but below the double-digit ratios that many rivals maintained. Its ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets was 3.28 percent; many analysts prefer to see 5 percent. (Reporting by  Juan Lagorio ; Editing by  Leslie Gevirtz )
