 (Reuters) - Canada's Teck Resources ( TCKb.TO ) ( TCK.N ) said on Friday it will sell a 17.2 percent equity stake to state-owned China Investment Corp through a private placement that will raise C$1.74 billion ($1.5 billion) and help the miner pay down debt. 

 Earlier this month, China's Commerce Ministry said that China would steadily push its "go abroad" investment policy, unperturbed by the collapse of a $19.5 billion tie-up between Rio Tinto ( RIO.AX ) and Chinese metals conglomerate Chinalco. The following are some major Chinese investments in the commodities and energy sectors this year: * June 24, 2009 - Sinopec, China's largest oil refiner, agreed to buy Swiss oil explorer Addax Petroleum Corp AXC.TO for $7.24 billion, a deal that will give it access to high-potential oil blocks in West Africa and Iraq. * June 23, 2009 - Chinese power company GCL-Poly Energy Holdings ( 3800.HK ) said it would pay $3.38 billion for a Jiangsu province solar parts maker in a move to tap the country's growing solar energy industry. * June 9, 2009 - Canadian mining and exploration company Consolidated Thompson CLM.TO said it had finalized terms of an agreement with China's Wuhan Iron and Steel Corp for a $240 million investment. * May 24, 2009 - Asia's largest oil and gas producer PetroChina ( 0857.HK ) agreed to buy Keppel Corp's ( KPLM.SI ) 45.5 percent stake in Singapore Petroleum Company for S$1.47 billion ($1.02 billion). * April 30, 2009 - Chinese state-owned China Nonferrous Metal Mining Group agreed to take a majority stake in Australian rare earths miner Lynas Corp Ltd ( LYC.AX ) for A$252 million ($185.7 million). * April 1, 2009 - Australian zinc miner OZ Minerals ( OZL.AX ) agreed to sell most of its assets to China's Minmetals for $1.21 billion. * Feb 24, 2009 - Chinese steel mill Hunan Valin Iron and Steel said it will pay A$1.2 billion ($770 million) for a 16.5 percent stake in Fortescue Metals Group ( FMG.AX ). * February 5, 2009 - Shenzhen Zhongjin Lingnan Nonfemet ( 000060.SZ ), China's third-largest zinc producer, wins Australian government approval to acquire a controlling stake in zinc miner Perilya ( PEM.AX ).
