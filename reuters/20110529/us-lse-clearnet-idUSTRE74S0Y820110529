 LONDON  (Reuters) - The London Stock Exchange ( LSE.L ) said it is not in talks with LCH.Clearnet, following speculation that it had been one of a number of exchanges that had made a bid for the European clearinghouse. 

 In a short statement on Sunday, the LSE - the owner of the London bourse - said: "The London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) notes the recent press speculation regarding it and LCH.Clearnet Group. "LSEG confirms that it is not engaged in any discussions with LCH regarding a possible transaction." On Saturday, LCH.Clearnet confirmed it had received "various proposals" from exchange operators interested in some form of business tie-up [ID:nLDE74R065]. A source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday that NYSE Euronext NYX.N, Nasdaq OMX Group ( NDAQ.O ) and the LSE had made offers for the clearinghouse, with the Financial Times putting the LSE bid value at 1 billion euros ($1.43 billion). The exchanges are in the midst of a wave of consolidation, with the LSE having agreed a $3 billion bid to buy Canadian peer TMX Group ( X.TO ). Clearinghouses stand between parties to a trade to guarantee obligations if there is a default. ($1=.6982 Euro) (Reporting by Rosalba O'Brien; Editing by Jon Loades-Carter)
