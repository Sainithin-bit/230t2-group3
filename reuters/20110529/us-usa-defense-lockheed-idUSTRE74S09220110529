 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp, the U.S. government's top information technology provider, said on Saturday that it detected and thwarted "a significant and tenacious attack" on its information systems network one week ago. 

 "As a result of the swift and deliberate actions taken to protect the network and increase IT security, our systems remain secure," Jennifer Whitlow, a Lockheed spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed statement. "No customer, program or employee personal data has been compromised." Lockheed's information security personnel are working around the clock to restore employee access to the "information systems network" targeted in the May 21 attack, the statement said. Bethesda, Maryland-based Lockheed, the Pentagon's No. 1 supplier by sales and the world's largest aerospace company, has kept the "appropriate U.S. government agencies" informed of its actions, it added.
