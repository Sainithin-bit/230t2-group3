 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Defense Department said the impact on the Pentagon of a cyber attack on Lockheed Martin Corp had been "minimal" and it expected no harm to result. 

 "Impact to DoD is minimal and we don't expect any adverse effect," Lieutenant Colonel April Cunningham said in an emailed reply to Reuters. "As a matter of standing DoD policy, we do not comment on operational matters." (Reporting by  Jim Wolf , editing by Will Dunham)
