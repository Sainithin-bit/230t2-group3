 MIDLAND, Texas  (Reuters) - The recent rise in lending in the United States comes from increased demand from credit-worthy borrowers, not from a decline in lending standards, Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Richard Fisher said on Wednesday. 

 He made the comment in response to an audience question after a speech in Midland, Texas. He was asked if recent data showing a rise in lending was due, as one newspaper had reported, to lax lending standards. (Reporting by  Ann Saphir ; Editing by  Padraic Cassidy )
