 ABU DHABI  (Reuters) - Egypt's central bank has rejected a sole bid by a consortium led by Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank ADIB.AD for Egypt's National Bank for Development DEVE.CA, calling it too low, a member of the group said on Thursday. 

 "The Egyptian central bank has rejected the offer made by Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank and Emirates International Investment Company," an Emirates International spokesman said in a statement. "The Egyptian central bank said the price of 11 Egyptian pounds (US1.93) per share was low." An official at the National Bank for Development said earlier that the offer, which was less than one-third of the lender's market price when it was announced, was the only bid received. The price was below the year low of 13.14 pounds for National Bank stock. Shares plunged 55 percent to 16.25 in local trading on Thursday, after hitting 36.17 when the offer was announced this week. The UAE consortium is effectively led by the ruling family of Abu Dhabi, the largest member of the United Arab Emirates federation. Emirates International, owned by the ruling family, is the biggest shareholder of Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank. National Bank for Development had 28.19 million shares issued at the end of 2006, which would value the bid at 310 million pounds. The winning bidder must undertake to raise the bank's capital to 500 million pounds, the stock exchange said on Thursday. The Egyptian government owns 17.86 percent of National Bank, with the rest in private hands, it said. Egypt's central bank is encouraging consolidation in the banking sector and wants the government to reduce its holdings in lenders. Bank of Alexandria was the first of four big state-owned banks to be privatized last year.
