 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - DaimlerChrysler DCXGn.DE Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche wants to keep a minority holding in U.S. automaker Chrysler and only sell a majority stake in the business, Der Spiegel magazine reported. 

 A Daimler spokesman declined to comment on the report on Saturday but referred to previous comments by Zetsche that he was keeping "all options" open. Zetsche wants to safeguard cooperation between Mercedes-Benz and Chrysler through the minority holding, Der Spiegel said. Potential Chrysler buyers -- financial investors Blackstone BG.UL and Cerberus CBS.UL and Canadian auto parts maker Magna International MGa.TO -- also want Daimler to retain an investment in Chrysler, the magazine added. Billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian earlier this month offered to pay $4.5 billion to buy the struggling automaker from DaimlerChrysler, which paid almost $40 billion for it in 1998.
