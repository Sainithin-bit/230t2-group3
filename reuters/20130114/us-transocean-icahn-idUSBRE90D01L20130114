 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Transocean Ltd ( RIG.N ) has disclosed that billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn has acquired a 1.56 percent stake in the offshore rig contractor and is looking to increase that holding. 
 Icahn is seeking regulatory approval to acquire shares worth more than $682.1 million, according to a statement on Transocean's Web site. If he gets approval, Icahn would become one of Transocean's largest shareholders with just over 5 percent of the company, based on its closing stock price of $54.09 on January 11. Transocean's biggest shareholder is Capital World Investors, a division The Capital Group Companies Inc, which owned 5.12 percent as of October 15, according to Thomson Reuters ( TRI.N ) data. Icahn's move comes less than two weeks after Transocean agreed to pay $1.4 billion to settle U.S. government charges over BP Plc's ( BP.L ) massive Gulf of Mexico oil spill in 2012 . Transocean employed nine of the 11 workers killed in the accident. (Reporting By Jessica Toonkel; Editing by  Paul Tait  and Stephen Coates)
