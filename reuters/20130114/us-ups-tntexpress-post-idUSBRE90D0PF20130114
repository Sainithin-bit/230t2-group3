 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Germany's Deutsche Post ( DPWGn.DE ) is not interested bidding for TNT Express ( TNTE.AS ) after UPS ( UPS.N ) said it was dropping its 5.2 billion euro bid for the Dutch delivery firm, its finance chief said. 
 "We're pursuing an organic growth strategy, so we are not interested in acquisitions of any kind in the express business, including TNT," he told Reuters in an interview on Monday. (Reporting by  Lynn Adler ; Writing by  Maria Sheahan )
