 LONDON  (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline Plc ( GSK.L ) and 
AstraZeneca Plc ( AZN.L ) said on Sunday Britain's Serious Fraud 
Office has asked them to hand over confidential documents, 
following allegations bribes were paid to win contracts in 
Iraq. 

  The watchdog is investigating possible breaches of the 
oil-for-food sanctions program, which was designed to allow the 
deposed regime of Saddam Hussein to sell limited amounts of oil 
to buy food and medicine.  The drugmakers deny any wrongdoing and say they are 
cooperating fully with the authorities after receiving the 
request for documents.  "GSK does not believe that its employees or its agents in 
Iraq knowingly engaged in wrongdoing regarding the oil-for-food 
program," Glaxo, the world's second-largest drug company, said 
in a statement on Sunday.  "In fact, GSK went to considerable lengths to cooperate 
with UK government authorities responsible for the UK 
administration of the program, and to impose anti-corruption 
measures when dealing with intermediaries in Iraq."  Notices were served earlier this month by the fraud office 
requiring the drug firms to give up e-mails, faxes, contracts 
and invoices, according to the Sunday Telegraph newspaper.  The probe follows a 2005 United Nations report compiled by 
Paul Volcker, the former chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve, 
which listed more than 2,200 companies around the world that 
might have been linked to bribes paid to the Iraqi government.  Volcker concluded the oil-for-food program had become 
corrupt as Saddam's regime demanded kickbacks from foreign 
firms in return for lucrative contracts.  (Reporting by  Ben Hirschler ; editing by Sue Thomas)
