 LONDON  (Reuters) - European investors returned from the Christmas holidays in a buoyant mood on Wednesday, bidding up stocks and the euro, while the dollar fell on speculation of lower U.S. interest rates next year. 

 Europe's FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  climbed 0.9 percent to 1,484.9 points, within half a dozen points of a 5-1/2 year high as it tracked gains in the United States and Asia. Volumes were light as many traders opted to extend their holidays through to the New Year and as markets eyed new home sales data from the United States, due at 1500 GMT. "A disappointing reading, a fall from the previous month, will remove the idea of a soft landing for the U.S. economy. A better-than-expected number will confirm that we've seen the peak and downturn," said Frankfurt-based Heino Ruland of brokerage Steubing. "Other than the data, there's no common denominator in European stocks today -- just a straight rebound from Friday's losses." MSCI's index of Asia stocks outside of Japan .MSCIAPJ climbed to a record peak, while Wall Street rallied on Tuesday as more merger and acquisition activity and speculation the Federal Reserve might cut interest rates next year increased the appeal of equities. DOLLAR DOWN The dollar was weaker across the board in thin post-Christmas trade with traders betting the greenback's interest rate advantage will reduce in 2007 as the Fed cuts rates and the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan increase borrowing costs. Currency trading in Asia was disrupted after strong earthquakes near Taiwan damaged undersea telecommunications cables, restricting international telephone traffic and Internet speeds. The dollar was down nearly 0.4 percent against the euro  EUR=  at $1.3150 per euro, and down a similar percentage against the yen at 118.68  JPY= . Data showing weaker-than-expected Japan retail sales was overshadowed by a media report that the Bank of Japan will probably discuss raising interest rates at next month's policy meeting, keeping the yen little moved against the euro at 156.10 yen EURJPY=R. BONDS STEADY Weaker-than-expected U.S. factory output and retail sales data the previous session helped euro zone government bonds to steady after a hefty sell-off through December. "There may be some lift from the U.S. data but we cannot expect much significant movement in the market that is backed by volumes and we see a volatile market before data next week, when the market will resume some normality," said a senior trader in Berlin. The 10-year Bund yield EU10YT=RR was little moved at 3.886 percent, while the March Bund future FGBLH7 was up 2 ticks on the day at 116.64. U.S. light crude oil CLc1 fell below $61 a barrel as continued warm weather in the United States and Japan offset geopolitical jitters over oil producer Iran. Spot gold XAU= rose to around $626.80/627.80, helped by the weaker dollar.
