 (Reuters) - Sontra Medical Corp. SONT.O said it will cease operations as it has been unable to raise additional capital and plans to terminate all employees. 

 The medical technology company said in a statement that it intends to pay its current liabilities through an orderly wind-down of its operations. The company said it has elected to voluntarily delist from the Nasdaq following its decision to cease operations. (Reporting by Rakesh Dubey in Bangalore)
