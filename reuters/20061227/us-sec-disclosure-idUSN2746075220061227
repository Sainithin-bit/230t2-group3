 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. securities regulators have amended a rule they adopted in July on disclosing executive pay, allowing companies in most cases to report lower upfront values for stock options granted to top executives. 

 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Christopher Cox said the new requirements would be "easier for companies to prepare and for investors to understand." But the change drew fire from investor advocates, and a senior lawmaker, for helping companies obscure the often lavish value of long-term executive compensation. As adopted July 26, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rule would have required companies to include the value of unvested stock options - options that cannot be exercised until subsequent years - in new executive pay disclosures beginning in 2007. But in a statement issued Friday, the commission said it had changed the disclosure rule to match stock option accounting expense requirements which only require the cost of vested options -- those an executive can currently exercise -- to be counted as an expense. An SEC spokesman said the vote was unanimous. The incoming chairman of the House Finance Services Committee said in a statement on Wednesday he was disappointed with the SEC's "backtracking" and said it reinforced his determination that Congress needed to deal with excessive executive pay. "I am very disappointed with both the substance and the procedure used to reach the SEC's Christmas Eve decision to loosen reporting requirements for the pay of the top executives of public corporations," said Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Barney Frank, who will chair the committee come January. "It was a holiday present to corporate America," The New York Times quoted Ann Yerger, executive director of the Council of Institutional Investors, as saying. "It will certainly make the numbers look smaller in 2007 than they would otherwise have looked." How companies disclose stock option awards will now conform more closely to U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) rule "FAS 123R", according to the SEC's press release. That rule requires recognition of the costs of equity awards over the period in which an employee works for the award, the SEC said. Stock options often vest three to five years after being granted. Under the old rule, for example, the entire value of a stock option package expected to be worth $25 million over five years would be included in the new compensation documents as soon as it is granted. As amended, only about $5 million would be included for each year depending on the vesting schedule and fluctuations in the stock price. The SEC said the amendment would "give investors a better idea of the compensation earned by an executive or director during a particular reporting period." Frank said it was ironic the SEC would relax rules regarding stock options at precisely the time that widespread abuses of the practice were coming to light. The SEC, Department of Justice and Internal Revenue Service are investigating possible manipulation of stock options grants. More than 160 companies have been investigated or are conducting internal inquiries. "The problem of executive pay that is both greatly excessive and deliberately obscured is a grave one," Frank said. The SEC said it would be soliciting comment on the amendments for 30 days after publication of the rules in the Federal Register.
