 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Automobile Magazine on Wednesday named 
the Volkswagen AG ( VOWG.DE ) GTI as its 2007 car of the year, 
one of a series of year-end industry awards that automakers use 
to support their marketing efforts. 

  Gavin Conway, editor-in-chief of Automobile Magazine, said 
the sporty version of the VW Golf, now in its fifth generation, 
was the unanimous pick of the magazine's senior editors because 
of the way it combined performance and affordability.  Starting at under $23,000, the 2007 GTI has a 
200-horsepower, four-cylinder engine that takes the 2-door 
version to 60 mph (97 kph) in 6.6 seconds. The GTI also gets 
highway fuel economy of 30 miles to the gallon, Conway said.  "It's a great car to drive as well as being an easy car to 
live with," he said.  Conway said he expected that the selection would generate 
some controversy among the readership of the Ann Arbor, 
Michigan-based magazine, with some readers questioning why it 
had not opted for a far more expensive car.  But, he said, the magazine had wanted to highlight "a more 
responsible approach to performance driving," taking into 
account factors such as fuel economy.  The magazine, owned by Primedia Inc.PRM.N, named the 
Aston Martin V8 Vantage its design of the year.  Conway said Aston Martin, a unit of Ford Motor Co.( F.N ), 
deserved credit for building its $110,000 two-seater sports car 
in a way that harkened back to classic designs while 
incorporating more stringent safety regulations.  "Without question, the V8 Vantage is the best Aston Martin 
ever produced," Conway said in a statement, calling it 
"arguably the best-looking design car in the last couple of 
decades."  Automobile Magazine, which has a circulation of 550,000, is 
one of several industry publications that offer various car and 
truck of the year awards.  Automakers compete fiercely for the honors and tend to 
quickly work them into their own advertising in a bid to sway 
potential buyers.  Motor Trend, also owned by Primedia, last month named the 
Toyota Motor Corp. ( 7203.T ) Camry its 2007 car of the year.
