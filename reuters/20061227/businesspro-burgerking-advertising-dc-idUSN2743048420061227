 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A British ban on children's 
advertising could cost fast-food chain Burger King Holdings 
Inc. BKC.N as much as $196 million next year, according to a 
report in Britain's Daily Telegraph newspaper on Wednesday. 

  Giorgio Minardi, the company's head of northwest Europe, 
told the paper that "advertising is a key part of our drive to 
get kids and families into our restaurants. It will have a 
major impact on our top line."  Company representatives were not immediately available for 
comment.  The U.S.-traded shares of Burger King closed at $20.61 on 
Tuesday. The stock has climbed about 18 percent since it began 
trading publicly in May.
