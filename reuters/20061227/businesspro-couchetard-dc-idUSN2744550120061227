 TORONTO  (Reuters) - Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc. 
( ATDb.TO ), North America's third-largest convenience store 
operator, said on Wednesday it will buy 13 stores in Florida 
from privately held Richcor Inc. 

  Couche-Tard, headquartered in Laval, Quebec, expects the 
deal to close in February and said the assets would add to 
revenue and earnings.  Internal available cash will pay for the transaction, but 
due to a confidentiality agreement between the parties, the 
company said the purchase price cannot be disclosed at this 
time.  The 13 stores, which currently operate under the Groovin 
Noovin banner, will be converted to Couche-Tard's Circle K 
brand, though the Shell-branded gas will remain the same.  Couche-Tard also operates under the Couche-Tard and Mac's 
banners and competes with 7-Eleven Inc. ( 3382.T ) as well as 
Casey's ( CASY.O ) and The Pantry Inc. ( PTRY.O ).  After the transaction, Couche-Tard's network in its Florida 
and Gulf Division will include 669 company operated stories and 
64 dealer locations.  It said the stores are located on highly visible and well 
traveled roads and occupy strategic locations.  Shares of Couche-Tard rose 17 Canadian cents to C$25.27 on 
the Toronto Stock Exchange.  ($1=$1.16 Canadian)
