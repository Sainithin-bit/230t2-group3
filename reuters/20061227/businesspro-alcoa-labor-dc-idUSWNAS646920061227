 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Aluminum producer Alcoa Inc. ( AA.N ) 
said on Wednesday members of United Auto Workers Local 1050, 
which represents 830 employees at its facility in Cleveland, 
Ohio, ratified a four-year labor contract to end a two-month 
strike. 

  The UAW-represented employees will return to work on 
January 2, 2007, the company said.  "Compromises were made by both Alcoa and UAW Local 1050 
that have resulted in a fair and competitive multiyear labor 
agreement," Cleveland Works Plant Manager Brett McBrayer said 
in a statement.  The new contract introduces cost sharing for medical and 
prescription drug plans, continues to provide health care 
coverage for retirees, and limits the company's long-term 
liability, Alcoa said. It calls for annual wage increases and 
for a company match to the Alcoa 401(k) savings plan, and also 
introduces a new attendance policy and limits overtime.  In November, Alcoa reached an agreement for a four-year 
contract with the International Association of Machinists at 
the Cleveland Works facility, which makes forged parts for 
cars, trucks and airplanes.  That agreement affected 45 workers and included a $1,500 
signing bonus. The UAW had rejected the same pact.
