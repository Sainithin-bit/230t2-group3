 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The dollar slipped on Wednesday, but trimmed losses after a surprisingly robust U.S. housing report suggested the sector was stabilizing, easing expectations for interest rate cuts next year. 

 Volume was light, with many traders away ahead of the New Year's holiday this weekend.  "The new home sales report did beat the consensus forecast, and that, I think, provides further evidence to support the view that the worst of the housing downturn may have passed," said Alex Beuzelin, senior market analyst at Ruesch International in Washington. "If that's the case, that will help reassure people on the overall health of the economy and temper some talk that the Fed could move to lower rates early next year. In that regard, it's dollar positive," he added. The euro rose 0.2 percent against the dollar to $1.3120  EUR= , but was off session highs at $1.3178. Sterling, meanwhile, was up 0.1 percent at $1.9558  GBP= , well short of a peak of $1.9633 hit earlier in the session. Before the housing data, the dollar was much weaker on concerns about recent weak manufacturing and mortgage applications data. On Tuesday, the Richmond and Dallas Federal Reserve banks released soft manufacturing numbers, and on Wednesday data showed U.S. mortgage applications plummeted last week to the lowest level in nearly five months.  "We've got the two bugbears of the dollar -- housing and manufacturing -- which are not flashing very positive signals at the moment," said Shaun Osborne, chief currency strategist at TD Securities in Toronto. Wednesday's positive U.S. new home sales data did ease worries about the sector, although some analysts said given thin trading the report's impact could be limited. The euro, on the other hand, continued to rack up gains, driven by continued expectations that the European Central Bank will raise interest rates further next year from the current 3.5 percent. The currency earlier hit a 6-1/2 year high versus the Swiss franc at 1.6089 EURCHF=, buoyed by expectations that euro zone interest rates are set to rise in 2007. By contrast, the Swiss National Bank downgraded its inflation outlook for next year after raising rates earlier this month. Against the yen, the dollar fell to a session low of 118.29 yen before rebounding to 118.78 yen  JPY= , down 0.3 percent, after Jiji news agency reported late on Tuesday that the Bank of Japan is likely to discuss raising rates to 0.5 percent next month. Jiji, citing no sources, added that the decision could be postponed to February or later in the case of unexpected events in financial markets.  (Additional reporting by  Steven C. Johnson )
