 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Avista Corp. ( AVA.N ) said on Wednesday it received an order from Washington state regulators dismissing a request from the company to raise rates to pay for improvements to its transmission system and at several hydroelectric power plants. 

 The Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission found the information provided by Avista in its filing did not comply with applicable rules, the company said. Avista said it is evaluating its options and plans to file for rate relief as expeditiously as possible.
