 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Comverse Technology Inc. CMVT.O said on Wednesday it has received a letter of default from The Bank of New York Trust Company over the software maker's failure to file certain financial statements with federal regulators. 

 Comverse said it believes no default has occurred and that it was not required to file its 2005 annual report or 2006 quarterly reports by any particular date to remain in good standing as part of its agreement with the bank.
