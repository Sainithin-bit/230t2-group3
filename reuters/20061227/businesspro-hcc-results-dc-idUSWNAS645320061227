 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - HCC Insurance Holdings Inc. ( HCC.N ) 
said on Wednesday it had completed its independent review of 
its options granting practices and reported earnings for the 
first, second and third quarters of 2006. 

  Net earnings for the third quarter were $93.3 million, or 
80 cents a share, compared with $7.4 million, or 7 cents a 
share in the third quarter of 2005, when the company 
experienced hurricane losses.  On December 20, Houston-based HCC said it would restate its 
financial results to correct accounting errors related to its 
stock-based compensation grants going back nine years and 
expected to take a charge of about $30 million as a result. It 
said Chief Executive Officer Stephen Way and General Counsel 
Chris Martin had resigned.  On Wednesday the insurer said its non-cash compensation 
expense to correct the errors discovered in its investigation 
for 1997 through 2005 was $26.6 million. The pretax charge had 
no impact on revenue or cash flow, the company said.  In early trading, HCC shares rose 42 cents, or 1.3 percent, 
to $32.08 on the New York Stock Exchange.  Analysts had expected HCC to earn 74 cents a share in the 
third quarter, according to Reuters Estimates.  For the first nine months of the year, earnings more than 
doubled to $261.5 million, or $2.24 a share, from $126.2 
million or $1.17 a share in 2005.
