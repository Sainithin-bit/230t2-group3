 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Cardinal Health Inc. ( CAH.N ), one of the largest U.S. prescription drug distributors, said on Tuesday it will pay $11 million to settle a probe by New York State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer into improper secondary market trading of pharmaceuticals. 

 The settlement is the first in the attorney general's probe into trading practices in the market in which wholesalers trade drugs among themselves after they are sold by manufacturers, but before they are bought by pharmacies and hospitals. Spitzer said in a statement that such trading is not necessarily illegal, but can cause unreliable or counterfeit drugs to enter the marketplace, or cause drugs to be diverted outside their intended distribution channels. The probe began in April 2005. Dublin, Ohio-based Cardinal will pay $7 million to the nonprofit Health Research Inc., $3 million to the state, and $1 million to cover the investigation's costs. The company will also adopt standards to ensure the safe trading of drugs. Cardinal cooperated with the probe, shut its pharmaceutical trading company in the summer of 2005, and stopped buying drugs in the secondary market last December, Spitzer said. Jim Mazzola, a Cardinal spokesman, said: "The safety and security of the nation's pharmaceutical supply is one of Cardinal Health's top priorities, and certainly a responsibility we take very seriously." Cardinal said it previously set aside $11 million for the settlement. The company ranks 19th on the Fortune 500 list of the biggest U.S. companies by revenue. Spitzer in April 2005 subpoenaed the three largest U.S. drug wholesalers -- Cardinal, AmerisourceBergen Corp. ( ABC.N ) and McKesson Corp. ( MCK.N ) -- in connection with the probe. AmerisourceBergen spokesman Michael Kilpatric said: "We have been cooperating with the attorney general's office and responded to its requests months ago. We have not been advised of any misconduct and believe we are not engaged in any wrongdoing." Representatives of McKesson did not immediately return calls seeking comment. According to Spitzer, Cardinal bought drugs from some "alternate" source vendors, despite the risks, to take advantage of higher profit margins. The company also repeatedly sold drugs to some customers it knew or should have known were illegally diverting the drugs, he said. In some cases, according to settlement documents, Cardinal sold drugs to wholesalers on its "excluded vendor list," or that its compliance officers wanted added to that list. Spitzer will become New York's governor next month, and be replaced as attorney general by Andrew Cuomo, a son of former governor Mario Cuomo. In late afternoon trading, Cardinal shares rose 53 cents to $64.73 on the New York Stock Exchange. They began the year at $68.75.
