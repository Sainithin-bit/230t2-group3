 TORONTO  (Reuters) - Bombardier Inc. ( BBDb.TO ) said on 
Wednesday that its transportation unit will supply Nederlandse 
Spoorwegen, or Netherlands Railways, with 50 double-deck 
electrical trains designed for intercity use. 

  The order volume amounts to about $569 million and the 
first of the new trains are due to be delivered in June 2008, 
the company said.  The four-car multiple units will seat 20,000 in total, and 
will be produced at Bombardier's manufacturing sites in Gorlitz 
and Aachen, in Germany.  The company, the world's top manufacturer of railcars, said 
it first delivered these types of trains, called VIRM, to 
Netherlands Railways in 2002, and the existing fleet totals 378 
cars.  ($1=$1.16 Canadian)
