 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Sales of new U.S. homes were unexpectedly strong in November and the backlog of unsold homes shrank, according to government data on Wednesday that suggested the worst of the housing slump may be in the past. 

 New single-family home sales rose 3.4 percent last month to an annual rate of 1.047 million units from an upwardly revised 1.013 million units in October, the Commerce Department said. It also revised August and September sales higher. Wall Street analysts had expected sales to rise to a 1.018 million rate in November from the previously reported October pace of 1.004 million units. Alex Beuzelin, senior market analyst for Ruesch International in Washington, said the report provided "further evidence to support the view that the worst of the housing downturn may have passed." The data helped push U.S. stock prices higher. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average surged 102.94 points to a record close of 12,510 as shares of home builders rose. Prices for U.S. government bonds fell and the dollar came off earlier lows as traders saw the report as lessening chances the Federal Reserve would lower interest rates early in the new year to bolster the economy. The supply of homes available for sale, measured at the current sales pace, fell to 6.3 months' worth in November from 6.7 months' worth in October. A total of 545,000 homes were on the market at the end of November, off slightly from October. A glut of unsold homes had led builders to scale back construction, weighing on U.S. economic growth. The economy expanded at a tepid 2 percent annual rate in the third quarter as home-building saw its deepest downturn in 15 years. Compared to November 2005, new home sales were off 15.3 percent, an sign of how far the once high-flying market has fallen. Like the drop in inventories of unsold homes, a rise in sales prices provided a hopeful sign for the beleaguered housing sector. The department said the median price of a new home increased 3.2 percent to $251,700 last month. MORTGAGE APPLICATIONS FALL While some analysts saw the data as a sign of growing health in the housing sector, others urged caution in light of another report showing a slip in mortgage applications. The Mortgage Bankers Association said mortgage applications fell last week by 14.2 percent to their lowest level since early August. "You still have a significant supply and there's still a long way for that to work through the market," said Benjamin Halliburton, managing director of Traditional Capital Management in Summit, New Jersey. "We're definitely not out of the woods," he said. Other reports released on Wednesday suggested retail sales were lackluster in the week before the Christmas holiday. The International Council of Shopping Centers and UBS Securities said the year-on-year gain in U.S. chain stores sales slowed last week to just 1.7 percent above year-ago levels. It was the weakest year-over-year reading since February 12, 2005. Separately, Redbook Research said chain store sales were down 1.6 percent this month through December 23 when compared with the same period in November. "The Christmas week was on target for most, but no better," Redbook Research said. Another report showed factory activity in the U.S. Midwest picked up last month. The Chicago Federal Reserve Bank said its Midwest manufacturing index rose 0.3 percent in November to 104.4, but the increase was from a downwardly revised 104.1 in October. October's initial reading was a more-robust 106.1. A number of other recent regional factory surveys have indicated manufacturing weakness continued into December.
