 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Aluminum producer Alcoa Inc reported a second consecutive quarterly loss on Tuesday, due mostly to a drop of 9 percent in the metal's price this year. 

 The following are comments from market specialists on the results: COMMENTS: KEITH WIRTZ, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER OF FIFTH THIRD ASSET MANAGEMENT, WHICH MANAGES $22 BILLION "There's no doubt in my mind that we are in for a really nasty earnings season. Alcoa's second consecutive quarterly loss is testament to that. "It just shows you how enormously challenging the fourth and the first quarter have been for companies. We are in the worse phase of this recession right now." MIN YE, EQUITY ANALYST, MORNINGSTAR IN CHICAGO "We were expecting a pretty bad first quarter and it came out pretty bad. Sales were higher than we expected, but it looks like earnings were slightly worse than we expected. When you consider they issued convertible debt in the quarter there is the dilutive effect, which isn't captured here. "They raised a lot of cash during the quarter by issuing common equity and the convertible debt. By the end of the first quarter they had $1.1 billion of cash, which doesn't seem like a whole lot. It puts them in a better position, but the situation is not turning very quickly, especially because they were cash flow negative during the quarter. "They are still burning cash and the market conditions have yet to turn and something more needs to be done to make the firm cash-flow positive. The cash situation still seems tight. "They are doing all the right things to preserve liquidity, but market fundamentals are pretty bad. Positive news is that prices seem like they have leveled off, but demand has not picked up and inventories are high. "It's going to take some time for prices to recover." JONATHAN PAVLIK, PORTFOLIO MANAGER AT STEWART CAPITAL ADVISORS LLC IN INDIANA, PENNSYLVANIA "It looks like their cost-cutting measures and that recent capital raise is bearing fruit as far as their liquidity position goes. "Maybe here in the short term they've done some things to shore up their balance sheet but as far as where they're selling and at what price, they're really not getting any help there. "I did see a line in there that they see some catalysts both short-term and long-term that are going to help out their business so I'd be interested to see what they will talk about there." CHARLES BRADFORD, BRADFORD RESEARCH "They seem to have much bigger tax credit. If you look at the income statement they reported a loss before taxes of $777 million and they have a benefit of $307 million. So they had a tax credit in the quarter of 40 percent. That's a lot higher than their normal tax credit ... That might be why the number came in a lot better than I expected. "The cost reductions were impressive. I had assumed based on what they had said 3 months ago that they would have some cost reductions. They talked about 26 percent, and apparently it was much better than that. I had assumed that there was a $50 cost savings on the alumina which would have been about 20 percent, and they are saying it was more like a third. "What we don't know was how much of that they did, how much was due to lower energy costs, and how much was due to currency. But still, getting cost savings as much as they've gotten is a distinct positive, because they really can't do much about the metal price." TONY ROBSON, MINING EQUITY ANALYST AT BMO NESBITT BURNS, TORONTO "The downstream just looks awful -- automotive, aerospace, construction, flat-rolled products -- that is, sheet for consumer and construction, was quite a poor show. "But engineered products was still making a profit, which is positive. The biggest loss was in primary metals or smelting aluminum. Their production costs currently remain above the current spot (aluminum) price." MICHAEL JAMES, SENIOR TRADER, WEDBUSH MORGAN, LOS ANGELES "Given it's an industrial name, I think the expectations were pretty low given where we are in the economic cycle. I think there's still more color needed from the conference call in terms of forward guidance. "I think the forward guidance is going to be far more important that the reported number, whether they provide any guidance or refrain from giving any guidance due to the economic uncertainty."
