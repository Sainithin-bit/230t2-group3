 BANGALORE  (Reuters) - Pier 1 Imports Inc ( PIR.N ) reported a wider-than-expected quarterly loss on Tuesday as markdowns ate into the home furnishings retailer's margins. 

 Home-goods chains have been forced to take huge markdowns to manage excess inventory levels as a U.S. housing slump and recession erode demand for furnishings and other big-ticket items. Merchandise margins at Pier 1, whose rivals include Williams-Sonoma Inc ( WSM.N ) and Bed Bath & Beyond ( BBBY.O ), shrank to 44.3 percent from 48.1 percent a year earlier. Pier 1's loss came to $29 million, or 33 cents a share, in the fourth quarter ended on February 28, compared with a year-earlier profit of $14 million, or 16 cents a share. Excluding charges for severance, asset write-downs and other items related to store closings, the loss was 23 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates, while analysts were expecting an 18-cent loss. Quarterly sales at the Fort Worth, Texas-based retailer fell about 11 percent to $389 million, above analysts' expectations of $360.2 million. Sales at stores open at least a year fell 9.7 percent. Pier 1 has been axing jobs, closing stores and negotiating with landlords to slash rents as part of its efforts to cut costs in a deepening recession. The company said it began this fiscal year with 1,092 stores in North America. Following talks with landlords, Pier 1 said it had agreements to terminate leases on 20 stores. The company will close two additional stores for which termination or rental reduction agreements have not been reached. Pier 1 said it expected to take charges of about $6 million for the closures and to record $4 million of them in the current, first quarter. The company expects liquidation sales at the closing stores to partially offset the charges. The company expects to close no more than 80 locations in fiscal 2010 and sees rental savings of about $6 million for the year. Pier 1 stock, which had shed 91 percent of its value in the past year, was up 13 cents, or 20.3 percent, at 77 cents in morning New York Stock Exchange trade.
