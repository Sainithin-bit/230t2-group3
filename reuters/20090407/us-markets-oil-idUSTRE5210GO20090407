 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil futures fell more than $1 a barrel after Tuesday's settlement as the American Petroleum Institute reported a big build in crude supply. 

 May delivery crude hit $48.14 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange's Globex trading platform. Earlier on Tuesday, U.S. crude settled at $49.15 a barrel, down $1.90. It was the third straight trading session that crude prices slipped. (Reporting by  Bernie Woodall )
