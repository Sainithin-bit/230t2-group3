 LONDON  (Reuters) - Europe's inability to stem its debt crisis is forcing conservative fund managers to take a more active approach to investment to rescue returns on government bond portfolios once seen as a risk-free asset class. 

 They are considering the use of derivatives and more proactive investment tactics to calm nervous clients such as insurance companies and pension funds -- but will need to re-educate investors on the new, unfamiliar risks this brings. "Investors in sovereign bonds thought they were investing in an interest rate product and what this crisis has pointed out is that they are actually invested in a (corporate) credit product," said John McNeill at Aegon Asset Management. Most government debt funds track indexes, seeking passive exposure to what has long been regarded as a safe haven for risk-averse investors content with modest returns. But the 85 billion euro ($112.1 billion) bailout of Ireland is just the latest shock to government bond markets, where the cost of protection against default has soared. The prospect of haircuts on sovereign debt holdings looms, now that the European Union plans to set up -- from 2013 -- a permanent mechanism to handle sovereign defaults that politicians have said will involve the private sector. Opportunities to offload risk via conventional means are limited for managers caught with unwanted exposure to Irish, Portuguese and Spanish government bonds, pushing them to consider swaps that might provide refuge. But most are acutely aware these complex instruments could just as easily repel investors as reassure them. "Some fund managers are using CDS but people should be hesitant about relying on them because they can create a false sense of security," said Arnold Gast, co-head of fixed income at Delta Lloyd Asset Management said. "Nobody knows what a restructuring would look like, would they really protect you?," he said. With even hedge funds shirking CDS, buying protection against Irish or Portuguese default is a costly gamble that isn't guaranteed to pay off. Moreover, tighter regulation of the multi-trillion dollar CDS market looms, further complicating how to price these instruments according to the risk they carry. FEW OPTIONS LEFT Last week, the cost of buying five-year protection from default on Portuguese and Spanish sovereign debt peaked at 552 and 365 basis points per 10 million euros respectively, against 344 and 249 basis points on June 1, data from Markit showed. That recent widening in CDS spreads -- the premium for a counterparty willing to bet that Spain or Portugal will not default -- suggests that confidence in their solvency, and future appetite for their bonds, is weakening. A host of European insurers with significant holdings in peripheral European government debt saw their own CDS spreads ballooning last week, reflecting broad fears that their exposure to the asset class could hurt them. With few other options left -- and several more European countries struggling to make ends meet -- fund houses will have to convince clients to give them more license to be creative about how they manage these products. That erodes the notion that sovereign debt funds are dependable anchors in investment portfolios not only for clients, but also for the fund managers themselves who reap what they dub "efficient" -- ready easy -- fee income. "Hopefully people will realize that index-tracking is not the way to go for sovereign funds. You cannot be a passive investor in a market such as this," Gast said. Managers would have to develop "a special set of skills" to position a sovereign debt fund in today's market to identify ratings weaknesses but also relative value, he said. Maybe investors overexposed to troubled economies should start thinking about taking losses on bonds to reduce their overall risk -- a wholly novel scenario for these managers who hold debt to maturity, and don't mark to market. After swallowing these losses, they could then create and manage bond portfolios on a more discretionary basis, customizing indexes to adjust or even eliminate exposure to some credits and potentially earning higher fees. "If a client wants my team to take a view on what we think about Spain and Italy versus Germany and the index...then higher fees are fair because you are paying for a qualitative service," said Bill Street," global head of active fixed income at State Street Global Advisors said.
