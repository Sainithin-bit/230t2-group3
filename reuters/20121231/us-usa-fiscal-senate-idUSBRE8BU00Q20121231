 (Reuters) - The Senate adjourned for the day on Sunday as Republicans and Democrats remained at odds over a deal to prevent taxes for all Americans from rising on New Year's Day. 
 Senator Richard Durbin said the Senate would reconvene at 1100 EST/1600 GMT on Monday. (Editing by  Christopher Wilson )
