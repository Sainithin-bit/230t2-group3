 Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said on Monday that congressional negotiators still need to bridge differences in last-ditch talks to avert a New Year's Day tax hike on most Americans. 
 "Discussions continue today on a plan to protect middle-class families from a tax increase tomorrow. There are a number of issues on which the two sides are still apart but negotiations are continuing as I speak," Reid, a Democrat, said on the Senate floor. "We really are running out of time. Americans are threatened with a tax hike in just a few hours." (Reporting by  David Lawder ; Editing by  Bill Trott )
