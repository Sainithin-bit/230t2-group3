 WASHINGTON, Dec 31 - U.S. Senate Republicans on Monday appeared to be coalescing around a potential solution to the "fiscal cliff" crisis with a plan that would continue expiring tax cuts for household incomes of up to $450,000, congressional sources said on Monday. 
 "I think a majority of our caucus will go along with it," a senior Senate Republican aide told Reuters. Senate Democrats had not yet expressed positions on the emerging deal. (Reporting by  Thomas Ferraro ,  Richard Cowan  and  Kim Dixon ; Editing by  Will Dunham )
