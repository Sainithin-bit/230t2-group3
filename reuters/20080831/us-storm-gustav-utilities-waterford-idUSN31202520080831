 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - Entergy Corp's 1,152-megawatt (MW) Waterford nuclear plant in Louisiana was preparing to shut the reactor late Sunday as Hurricane Gustav barreled toward the U.S. Gulf coast, said the company and the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 

 The reactor, less than 80 miles from the coastline, is in the current path of Gustav, which is forecast to slam the Louisiana coast Monday. Regulatory procedures require that the plant be shut in advance of the arrival of hurricane-force winds at the plant site, an Entergy spokesman said on Sunday. Damage to Entergy's electric transmission and distribution system from hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005 hampered restoration of oil and gas production and refinery operations along the Texas/Louisiana coast for weeks, leading to high natural gas and gasoline prices nationwide. "Waterford is forecast to get category 1 winds" of 74 miles per hour or greater, said Entergy Nuclear spokesman Carl Rhode. The unit was running at 100 percent Sunday afternoon, but was expected to begin a controlled shutdown Sunday night, Rhode said. The 1,957-MW Waterford station, located near Taft in St. Charles Parish, about 30 miles west of New Orleans, includes one nuclear reactor and two natural-gas fired units. One MW powers about 500 homes in Louisiana. Entergy also operates the 967-MW River Bend nuclear plant north of Baton Rouge. Rhode said that unit is not forecast to receive hurricane-force wind and is expected to operate through the storm if it remains on its current path. Rhode said the River Bend staff is monitoring the storm and is prepared to act if needed. New Orleans-based Entergy which supplies electricity to 2.7 million customers in Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas and Arkansas, was forced to relocate its headquarters to Jackson, Mississippi after Hurricane Katrina flooded New Orleans and damaged the city's electric and natural gas network.
