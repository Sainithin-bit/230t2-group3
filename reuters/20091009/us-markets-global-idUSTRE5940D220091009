 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rose from a 14-month low on Friday after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said the U.S. central bank will be ready to tighten monetary policy, sparking a sell-off in bond markets. 

 Gold, which nearly always moves inversely to the dollar, eased after hitting record highs for three straight sessions as Bernanke's comments late Thursday lifted the dollar broadly. The U.S. Dollar Index .DXY, measuring the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, rose 0.6 percent at 76.423. A stronger dollar initially pushed oil down toward $71 a barrel, but a positive demand outlook from the International Energy Agency led crude prices to settle with a slight gain. U.S. stocks rallied, with the broad S&P 500 Index and Nasdaq index extending winning streaks to five days, as investors anticipated positive news from key earnings reports next week. Bullish broker comments boosted tech shares. The three major U.S. equity indexes posted their best weekly gain since mid-July, and the Dow Jones industrial average reached a closing high for 2009. Bernanke's comments raised fears among investors that the Fed was closer to hiking interest rates than previously thought, sparking the biggest bond sell-off in more than a month. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell 1-4/32 in price to yield 3.39 percent. A lackluster U.S. 30-year bond auction on Thursday reminded both investors and officials that given a weak currency, foreign appetite for U.S. assets has its limits. "People are anticipating that now the Fed may be more inclined to raise rates earlier than anticipated," said Kevin Chau, currency strategist at IdeaGlobal in New York. "I think they will continue to jawbone by saying they're vigilant, but I think they will still hold off (raising rates) until the second half of 2010." The Dow  .DJI  closed up 78.07 points, or 0.80 percent, at 9,864.94. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was up 6.01 points, or 0.56 percent, at 1,071.49. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was up 15.35 points, or 0.72 percent, at 2,139.28. "The mood is ... reasonably optimistic (on earnings), which is part of the reason why we have seen 3-4 percent gains so far this week," said Fred Dickson, market strategist at D.A. Davidson & Co in Lake Oswego, Oregon. The IEA increased its global oil demand growth estimate for 2010, as well as for the rest of 2009. U.S. crude settled up 8 cents at $71.77 a barrel. London Brent crude gained 23 cents to settle at $70.00 a barrel. "The oil market today is sort of trying to balance the competing influences -- the dollar and the stock market," said Brad Samples, an analyst at Summit Energy in Louisville, Kentucky. Bernanke's comments also weighed in Europe, helping push equities lower and the price of euro zone government debt. "Bernanke put the brakes on the market by supporting the dollar," said Alex Heath, head of base metals at RBC Capital Markets. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of top shares closed down 0.3 percent at 998.17. Ten-year euro zone government bond prices fell nearly a full point. Even though the Fed's vast support for the U.S. economy will likely be needed for some time, the central bank will have to remove those measures as the economy heals, to ward off any threat of inflation. The euro was down 0.53 percent at $1.4711. Against the yen, the dollar was up 1.59 percent at 89.82. U.S. gold futures slipped on the dollar bounce. December gold futures settled down $7.70 at $1,048.60 an ounce in New York. Asian shares hit a new 14-month high on investor optimism over the global economy. Japan's benchmark Nikkei average  .N225  rose 1.9 percent, and the MSCI index of Asia-Pacific stocks outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS edged up 0.3 percent to extend the week's gains of about 4.7 percent to hit a 14-month high of 402.16.
