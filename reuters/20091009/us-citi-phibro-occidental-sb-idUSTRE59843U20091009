 * Occidental, founded in California in 1920, is the fourth-largest U.S. oil and gas company by market capitalization, after doubling in value in the past four years. * Dr. Armand Hammer, an industrialist and philanthropist who had close ties to the Soviet Union, was elected president and chief executive officer in 1957. Ray Irani succeeded Hammer as CEO in 1990. He had been president since 1984. * Occidental operates in the United States, Libya, Oman, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Yemen, Argentina, Bolivia and Colombia. * In 2007, indigenous Peruvian Achuar communities filed a class-action lawsuit against the company, alleging oil production there had damaged their health. The company operated in Peru from 1975 to late 1999. * Occidental has also come under fire from environmentalists for its plans to drill for oil on land claimed by the U'wa Indian tribe in northeastern Colombia. * In the United States, the Los Angeles-based company has operations in Texas, New Mexico, Colorado and Kansas, as well as California.
