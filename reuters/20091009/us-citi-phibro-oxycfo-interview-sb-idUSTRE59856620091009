 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp does not expect Phibro to cause a material increase in volatility for its results given the relative size, Oxy's president and chief financial officer said on Friday. 

 "Compared to the rest of the business, this is real small," CFO Stephen Chazen told Reuters in a phone interview. "You probably won't even see the volatility." Chazen welcomed the fact that Phibro traders would be investing their own money in the business and that bonuses would be paid out over a long period of time, depending on their results. "I'm not worried about them gambling away the money," he added. Occidental had looked at acquiring Phibro a decade ago before it was pulled off the market, but Chazen said Occidental was a different company then anyway. "It would have been a hell of a deal, even at that," he said. "In round figures, the owners, net of bonuses and taxes, made $1.5 billion over that period for a sort of nothing investment."
