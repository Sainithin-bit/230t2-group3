 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of Citigroup Inc tumbled more than 5 percent on Friday after the bank announced that Robert Rubin has resigned as senior counselor and will not stand for reelection as director when his term expires. 

 The stock tumbled to $6.72 on the New York Stock Exchange, and its decline provided a further drag to the broader stock market. (Reporting by  Ellis Mnyandu )
