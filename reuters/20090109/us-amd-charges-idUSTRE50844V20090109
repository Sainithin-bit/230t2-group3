 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices Inc ( AMD.N ) expects to report restructuring and impairment charges amid a weaker economy and falling shares, according to a regulatory filing on Friday, although it gave no estimates. 

 AMD said it will incur additional restructuring charges in fiscal 2008 and 2009, after recording third-quarter severance and related costs of around $9 million on a previously-announced restructuring plan. It also expects an impairment charge in the fourth quarter amid "the continuing deterioration in the price of our common stock and the resulting reduced market capitalization."
