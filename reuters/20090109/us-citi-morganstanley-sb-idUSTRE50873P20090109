 (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc ( C.N ) is in advanced talks to sell its Smith Barney brokerage unit to Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ), a person familiar with the matter said on Friday. The move would further dismantle the financial supermarket that was performing poorly even before the credit crunch. 

 Under the plan being discussed, Morgan Stanley would own 51 percent of the joint venture and Citigroup would own the rest. Citigroup would cede operational and strategic control of the retail brokerage business to Morgan Stanley. Following, are some facts about the brokerage businesses of Citigroup and Morgan Stanley: * Smith Barney's roots go back to Philadelphia, where broker Charles Barney founded his firm in 1873 and investment banker Edward Smith started his in 1892. In 1938, the firms merged, forming Smith Barney. * In 1987, Smith Barney was acquired by financial services corporation Primerica, and six years later it became a subsidiary of Travelers Group, formed after the acquisition of The Travelers by Primerica. * In 1998, Sanford "Sandy" Weill's Travelers Group bought U.S. bank Citicorp to create Citigroup, the world's largest financial services conglomerate. Smith Barney became a division of Citigroup Global Markets Inc. The deal would be the latest step in dismantling Weill's original conception for Citigroup. * Morgan Stanley was created in 1935, when Henry Morgan and Harold Stanley left J.P.Morgan & Co to form the investment bank Morgan Stanley. Forty-two years later, the company entered the retail stock brokerage business as it merged with Shuman, Agnew & Co, a West Coast brokerage. * Smith Barney ended September with 14,735 brokers. It has 7.5 million client accounts, and $900 billion in client assets. Morgan Stanley ended November with 8,426 brokers, and $546 billion in client assets. * The combined entity would become the U.S. largest brokerage by number of financial advisers, prior to any attrition, surpassing Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) and Wells Fargo & Co ( WFC.N ).
