 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc is nearing the end of its search for a new chief executive officer, with a decision coming possibly as soon as next week, the Wall Street Journal reported late Thursday, citing people close to the internet company. 

 One of the candidates still being considered is former chief executive officer of engineering software company Autodesk Inc Carol Bartz, according to a person familiar with the matter, the Journal reported. Yahoo's board is leaning toward a candidate from outside the company, according to people familiar with the matter, who also said Vodafone Group PLC's former Chief Executive Arun Sarin has withdrawn his name, the Journal said. The board has yet to make an offer and is unlikely to do so before next week, but hopes to announce a new leader before reporting fourth quarter results at the end of the month, according to these people. A Yahoo spokesman declined to comment. Jerry Yang said in November he would step down as CEO as soon as the board finds a replacement. (Reporting by  Phil Wahba ; Editing by Kim Coghill)
