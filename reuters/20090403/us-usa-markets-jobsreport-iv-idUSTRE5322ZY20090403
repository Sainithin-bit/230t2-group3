 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. employers slashed 663,000 jobs in March, lifting the unemployment rate to 8.5 percent, the highest since 1983, official data showed on Friday in a report underscoring the growing distress in the labor market. 

 KEY POINTS: * The Labor Department also revised January data to show job losses of 741,000 that month, the biggest decline since October 1949, as the economy battles a recession that has entered its 16th month. * The decline in non-farm payrolls in February was unrevised at 651,000. * Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast non-farm payrolls falling 650,000 in March. * They had forecast the unemployment rate rising to 8.5 percent from 8.1 percent the prior month. COMMENTS: CHRIS RUPKEY, CHIEF FINANCIAL ECONOMIST, BANK OF TOKYO-MITSUBISHI UFJ, NEW YORK: "Unemployment may be a lagging indicator but this jobs report is going to scare the daylights out of the consumer and if they don't spend, this recession may indeed last all year, making the dismal doomsayers forecast for the economy a hard reality. We may all be on foodstamps shortly if companies don't stop adjusting their headcounts downward." STEVEN ENGLANDER, CHIEF FX STRATEGIST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL, NEW YORK: "The jobs report was pretty much smack on and much better than the whisper number. What you are seeing is that bond yields are picking up a little bit, but they are not running up super fast. We've also seen dollar/yen go through a hundred again. Overall, there seems to be a little bit more optimism that policy moves are catching with the weakness in the economy. And even though the numbers are still reflecting the huge shocks...after the Lehman bankruptcy, going forward, the balance of what we're going to see is the effect of the policy moves rather than the heightened risk aversion that we saw in Q4. Bottomline, good news is a dollar-pain trade, although not necessarily against the euro, but more against commodity currencies and possibly selected emerging markets." TOM BENTZ, ANALYST, BNP PARIBAS COMMODITY FUTURES INC. NEW YORK; "The market is dipping but still pretty resilient. Crude spiked higher over night. The jobs data was better than consensus supported stock markets, and energy initially bumped up slightly also." CUMMINS CATHERWOOD, MANAGING DIRECTOR, BOENNING AND  SCATTERGOOD, WEST CONSHOHOCKEN, PENNSYLVANIA: "The thinking at 8.35 a.m. is that we're probably seeing the worst of it. Who the heck knows for certain, but this has been pretty darn dismal. "We are near the bottom, I really believe. But there's obviously stuff that can happen to change that analysis. We don't yet know how this automotive thing is going to turn out. That could be very disruptive. But I like what's happening here." DAVID RESLER, CHIEF ECONOMIST, NOMURA SECURITIES INTERNATIONAL, NEW YORK: "What is actually amazing is I can't remember an instance where the actual number was so close to the consensus across the board. Generally the report is about what you would have expected. Jobless claims have been telling us that we are looking at another ugly payrolls number, and this is ugly. It doesn't alter the bigger picture. It is confirming what we thought. This is telling us that there has been and continues to be a swift and aggressive reduction in employment." ASHRAF LAIDI, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, CMC MARKETS, LONDON: "The reaction in currency markets is purely a risk play, emerging on the fact that the unemployment rate and payrolls both came in within expectations, however negative these figures are for the U.S. economy. Considering that the dollar remains under pressure during the current bear market rally in equities, we could see prolonged downside pressure on the currency as the macro economic story in the U.S. continues to stand in the way of the currency. Interestingly, the U.S. unemployment rate has now risen above that of Germany and the euro zone, a historic feat that only gauges the extent of the macro economic damage in the U.S." MATT ESTEVE, FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRADER, TEMPUS CONSULTING, WASHINGTON DC: "It's a pretty awful number but it was almost to be expected. What is really important is the unemployment rate: at 8.5 percent, it is just too high. There seems to be no bottom in the US job markets yet, but other recent economic indicators have been better than expected. In the very short term, this number may weigh on the dollar, but the U.S. economy is still in better shape than places such as Japan. The balance is still tipping in favor of the dollar." MATT ESTEVE, FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRADER, TEMPUS CONSULTING IN WASHINGTON DC: "It's a pretty awful number but it was almost to be expected. What is really important is the unemployment rate: at 8.5 percent, it is just too high. There seems to be no bottom in the US job markets yet, but other recent economic indicators have been better than expected. In the very short term, this number may weigh on the dollar, but the U.S. economy is still in better shape than places such as Japan. The balance is still tipping in favor of the dollar." ROBERT MACINTOSH, CHIEF ECONOMIST, EATON VANCE CORP, BOSTON: "This is still an ugly number. Just because it wasn't uglier than the consensus, doesn't mean it wasn't ugly. "It's telling you we're in a deep recession and it's still going to be a while to get out of it, especially on the employment side of things. But you have to keep in mind that this is a lagging indicator, we're going to get bad employment numbers, along with the employment rate, even if the economy is starting to turn. "I don't think it's starting to turn yet, but I'm actually feeling more and more confident that maybe toward the end of the fourth quarter, we'll still have a negative print, but maybe in November or December we will actually see some positive activity. And we'll have a real positive quarter in the first quarter." PIERRE ELLIS, SENIOR ECONOMIST, DECISION ECONOMICS, NEW YORK: "Bonds extended their losses because the employment number, for once, is coming in close to economists' expectations. In recent months you tended to be surprised on the downside. The report does not contradict the growing notion that the economy is finding a bottom. Employment will not turn on a dime and certainly there's no sign of strength, but at least it's not getting worse and worse and worse. The shortened work week is troubling, but it's not a blowout negative report." SEAN SIMKO, FIXED INCOME PORTFOLIO MANAGER, SEI, OAKS, PENNSYLVANIA: "The payrolls report is in line with expectations so we are seeing initial pressure on Treasury yields to move higher here. If we continue to see these types of numbers stabilize I think it will put pressure on yields to move higher." PETER KENNY, MANAGING DIRECTOR, KNIGHT EQUITY MARKETS, JERSEY CITY, NEW JERSEY: "It gives the market a sense that we dodged a bullet in the very, very near term. It's positive in that it wasn't a blowout number of more than 750,000. All the indexes are higher because the market is breathing a sigh of relief because it wasn't a blowout of market psychology. It indicates a slackening of the rate of decline and leaves the bear market rally intact." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. equity index futures extend gains after data. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices extend losses. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar rises versus yen, pares gains versus euro.
