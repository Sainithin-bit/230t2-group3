 SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - The sales of Rolls-Royce cars will likely be flat this year but could potentially double next year as the global economy is expected to recover and as the firm introduces new models, a company official said on Friday. 

 "It could be anything from 50 percent higher to 100 percent higher," Graeme Grieve, sales and marketing director of Rolls-Royce, a unit of German car maker BMW ( BMWG.DE ), told Reuters in an interview. Grieve also said sales of Rolls-Royce in the first quarter had been stable despite the weakening global economy. (Reporting by Harry Suhartono; Editing by  Kevin Lim )
