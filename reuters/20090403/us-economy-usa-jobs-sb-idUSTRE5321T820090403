 STRASBOURG, France  (Reuters) - The United States is likely to see another grim monthly jobs report when it issues March data later on Friday, the White House said. 

 Speaking to reporters while traveling from London to Strasbourg, France, President Barack Obama's spokesman Robert Gibbs said it was safe to expect figures due at 8:30 a.m. EDT would include additional "severe" job cuts. "Obviously we'll get unemployment numbers later today. I think it's safe to expect -- without having seen them -- that we'll see additional severe job cuts in America," Gibbs said as he sought to underscore what he said was an important statement by the G20. Asked whether President Barack Obama had seen the jobs report, Gibbs said he thought he probably had. Gibbs was speaking aboard Air Force One as President Barack Obama flew from London, where G20 leaders agreed a $1 trillion package to boost the world economy, to Strasbourg for a NATO summit to be co-hosted by France and Germany.
