 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Anheuser-Busch InBev ( ABI.BR ) has walked away from a planned sale of its German beer brand Beck's to U.S. buyout firm Bain Capital, a German magazine reported. 

 Contracts had been ready to sign and Bain had secured financing for the projected 1.7 billion Euro ($2.54 billion) deal, weekly Wirtschaftswoche said on Saturday in an excerpt of an article to be published on Monday, citing financial sources. Nobody at Anheuser-Busch InBev was immediately available for comment. The sale of 13 eastern European breweries for 2.2 billion euros in October eased Anheuser-Busch InBev's debt burden enough for the brewing giant to call off the Beck's deal, Wirtschaftswoche reported.
