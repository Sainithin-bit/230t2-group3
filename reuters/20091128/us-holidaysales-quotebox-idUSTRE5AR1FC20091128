 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Shoppers returned to malls and retail websites searching for deals on Saturday. 

 Several said they were being extra cautious this year given a weak economy and high unemployment. Following is a selection of quotes from shoppers: LISA KYLE FROM PROSPECT PARK, PENNSYLVANIA "I'm managing better, not buying everything I see. I'm buying what my 5-year-old actually asks for. I'm not trying to fill up the tree." CHRISTINE TUCKER FROM PHILADELPHIA "I'm spending less on me, more on my grandchild. I look at the prices. I'm not spending anything on myself right now." AILEEN MENDEZ, 36-YEAR-OLD MOTHER OF THREE, WORKS AT MACY'S IN THE GALLERIA AT WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. "The mall's not that busy, but we're busy." "It's been difficult, but my husband and I don't feel affected. I've saved a lot. I like shopping but I save a lot by only buying what I need. Deal or no deal, I only buy what I need. If I need it, I get it. And if there's a deal, then that's better." "The deals are not what they were. Last year on Black Friday, I bought a coat for $80. This year, I bought a coat for $80 and it wasn't even Black Friday. Black Friday is not what it used to be." JANET MCDONALD FROM PRINCE FREDERICK, MARYLAND Last year, "I was doing coupons and stuff like that, and I still will when I have the time." CLAUDE SMITH, 45, FROM VIRGINIA, AT THE GALLERIA IN WHITE PLAINS "Things are bad. Everybody's thinking about saving everything they have. I go out when there's sales and that's it. I don't need anything." "I've not worked a day this year." "Wall Street is getting better but the average New Yorker is still feeling it. With unemployment, I make enough to survive. As soon as I start working, it'll get better." LISA GARCIA, 38-YEAR-OLD MOTHER OF FIVE, SHOPPING IN NEW YORK CITY "I am spending less as I just got a pay cut," she said. "I've got five children and I told each of them, 'You get one good thing and not more this year.'" NATASHA WALKER, 35-YEAR-OLD MOTHER OF THREE, SHOPPING IN NEW YORK CITY "I have three children. I am a single mom. The economy is bad. I am getting only those things that we really need," said Walker, whose purchases included a GPS navigation system for her car, CD holders, movies for her children and clothing for herself. "I am trying to watch my budget. I don't want to charge up my credit (card). I am more worried than last year."
