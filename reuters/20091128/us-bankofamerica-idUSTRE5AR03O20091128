 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ), the largest U.S. bank, amended on Friday the compensation agreements of two senior executives, following a review by the pay czar. 

 According to a regulatory filing, Chief Financial Officer Joe Price and mortgage head Barbara Desoer had their annual salaries set at $500,000. In addition, Price will get "stock unit awards" valued at $5.25 million, while Desoer will receive $3.95 million in stock, the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank said. The adjustments were retroactive to November 1, the filing said. In a regulatory filing in March, Bank of America said the 2008 salaries of Price and Desoer were $800,000. Both executives also received stock and option awards that increased the total 2008 compensation for Price to $4.02 million, and Desoer's compensation to $7.42 million. Bank of America's compensation plans are reviewed by the U.S. Treasury's special master for executive pay, Kenneth Feinberg, as the bank took $45 billion of bailout funds. The bank is looking for a new chief executive after CEO Kenneth Lewis announced he would retire by year-end following months of being dogged by a series of government investigations into the company's acquisition of Merrill Lynch.
