 DUESSELDORF, Germany  (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard ( HPQ.N ), the world's biggest maker of PCs and printers, sees sales growth at its imaging and printing unit stable or slightly lower this year as it focuses on its digital graphics business. 

 Vyometh Joshi, executive vice president in charge of the unit, told Reuters on Friday he also aimed for an operating margin of 13-15 percent this year and next, compared with 15 percent last fiscal year to end-October. "We would like to grow our business 4 to 6 percent in revenues and make 13 to 15 percent operating profit," Joshi said in an interview at the Drupa print media trade fair in Duesseldorf, Germany. Sales at HP's imaging and printing unit grew 6 percent last fiscal year. Asked whether the targets were for the current fiscal year, Joshi answered: "Yes, for next year also."
