 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. jeweler Tiffany & Co ( TIF.N ) reported a higher quarterly profit on Friday, boosted by strong sales in international markets, which pushed modest domestic sales to the backseat. 

 The net profit came to $64.4 million or 50 cents a share, in the quarter that ended Apr. 30, compared to $54.1 million or 39 cents a share in the year-earlier period. While Tiffany, like more mid-tier rivals such as Zale Corp ( ZLC.N ) or Finlay Enterprises FNLY.O, has also gone through a rough patch due to the weak U.S. economy, the jeweler said earlier in May that the year had gotten off to a "promising start." U.S. shoppers have cut back on items like jewelry and furniture, as they spend carefully and largely on necessities with rising prices such as food and gasoline.
