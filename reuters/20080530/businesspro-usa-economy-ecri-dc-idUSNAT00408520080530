 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A gauge of future U.S. economic growth 
slipped in the latest week but its annualized growth rate, 
while still in recessionary territory, was at a 22-week high, 
indicating improvement in short-term growth prospects, a 
research group said on Friday. 

  The Economic Cycle Research Institute, a New York-based 
independent forecasting group, said its Weekly Leading Index 
slipped to 132.8 in the week to May 23 from 133.0 in the prior 
period, revised down from 133.1.  The decline in the index was due to higher jobless claims 
and lower stock prices, but was mostly offset by lower interest 
rates and stronger housing, said Lakshman Achuthan, managing 
director at ECRI.  The index's annualized growth rate improved to negative 6.0 
percent, its highest since the week to December 21, from minus 
6.6 percent.  "The WLI declined for the third straight week, but its 
smoothed growth rate recovered to a 22-week high," said 
Achuthan. "Thus, shorter-term U.S. growth prospects have 
improved a little, but remain recessionary."  Occasionally the WLI and the growth rate move in different 
directions, because growth is derived from a four-week moving 
average.  (Reporting by  Rodrigo Campos ; Editing by Dan Grebler)
