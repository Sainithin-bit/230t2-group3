 LONDON  (Reuters) - Oil prices bounced back above $127 a barrel on Friday after a U.S. regulatory probe made dealers wary and participants squared accounts on the last trading day of the month. 

 U.S. crude was up 78 cents at $127.40 by 11:11 a.m. EDT (1511 GMT) after earlier trading as high as $128.30 in volatile trade. London Brent gained $1.83 to $128.72. Prices hit an all-time high of $135.09 a barrel last week, driven by concern supplies will struggle to match demand over the long term. Since then, the market has weakened, pulled lower by mounting evidence that in the short term high prices have begun to erode demand. "We're trying to not read too much into it (the market move) because we know volatility has picked up a great deal," said Brian Hicks, co-manager of the global resources fund at Texas-based U.S. Global Investors. "It's not at all unreasonable to see some further deterioration in the price of oil given the rapid run-up in the last 30 days." Prices fell in early trade on Friday, hitting a session low of less than $125 a barrel after the announcement of an investigation by U.S. regulator the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) made traders cautious, but many players are still bullish. "Our view is that this bull run is not over," said Mike Wittner of SG. "It's going to continue to be volatile ... there's further upside." He said the bank was forecasting lower U.S. demand, but expected Asian oil consumption to continue growing. While high prices have triggered protests in many countries, Asian demand has been kept robust in part because of fuel subsidies. The have cost governments millions, prompting Taiwan, Indonesia and Sri Lanka to raise domestic fuel prices and India is considering it. Yet South Korea said on Friday it might cut taxes on fuel to ease price pressures as transportation workers threaten to strike, and Thailand said it was selling fuel at a discount to bus companies after a one-day strike.
