 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Final bids for the Weather Channel are due by the end of Friday, with a consortium of NBC Universal ( GE.N ) and private equity firms Blackstone Group ( BX.N ) and Bain Capital seen leading the bidding, a source familiar with the situation said. 

 NBC, Blackstone and Bain will equally split $1.8 billion of equity in the bid, which will be worth $3.5 billion including debt, the source told Reuters. Another source familiar with the matter told Reuters last week that Time Warner Inc ( TWX.N ) was also in the running for the cable network, which produces national, regional and local weather-related programs. Privately held Landmark Communications, which put the channel up for sale along with other businesses, had originally sought $5 billion for the asset, sources have said. General Electric Co's NBC could combine the Weather Channel -- which has more than 96 million U.S. subscribers -- with its own digital weather network, NBC Weather Plus.
