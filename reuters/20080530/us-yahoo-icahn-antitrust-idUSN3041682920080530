 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. antitrust regulators have given billionaire investor Carl Icahn the go-ahead to purchase large blocks of Yahoo ( YHOO.O ) stock, the Federal Trade Commission said on Friday. 

 The FTC, which routinely looks at large stock purchases, said the moves were approved in a listing that it puts out several times a week. In mid-May, Icahn launched a campaign to replace Yahoo's board with new directors that would reopen buyout talks with Microsoft ( MSFT.O ), saying the board had acted "irrationally" in refusing the software giant's bid. Microsoft walked away from its sweetened $47.5 billion offer for the Internet company earlier this month. Microsoft had initiated an unsolicited bid originally worth around $44.6 billion at the end of January, which Yahoo rejected as insufficient. (Reporting by  Diane Bartz , editing by Mark Porter)
