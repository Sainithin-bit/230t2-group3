 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - UAL Corp, which had been in talks with US Airways Group, will not pursue a merger at this time, UAL's Chief Executive said on Friday in a message to employees. 

 The parent of United Airlines, the No. 2 U.S. airline, will take additional steps to "size the business appropriately," Tilton said. The airline had been exploring merger possibilities as a way to better withstand soaring fuel costs and low-fare competition. (Reporting by Kyle Peterson, editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
