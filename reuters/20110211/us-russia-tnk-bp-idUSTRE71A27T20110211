 KHANTY-MANSIISK/LONDON, Russia  (Reuters) - BP's 

 Russian joint venture TNK-BP said Friday it was studying an "offer" regarding the British oil firm's deal with state-run Rosneft but later retracted an accompanying comment that suggested it had been invited to join. The venture's deputy CEO Maxim Barsky was asked by reporters if his firm was interested in playing a role in the venture and if so, in what form. "We had an offer from BP which detailed the conditions of their agreement with Rosneft. Obviously a partnership would be interesting," he said. "The company is reviewing the offer and we will present it at the board of directors on February 18." Barsky was speaking during a visit to an oil-rich west Siberian region. Later, Barsky contacted Reuters to say that he had meant only that TNK-BP had received documents from BP relating to the Rosneft deal, and was reviewing those. BP's partner in TNK-BP, AAR, has so far opposed the BP-Rosneft tie-up. It believes the partnership violates a shareholder agreement and has secured a London court injunction to put the deal on hold. BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley floated the idea earlier this month that TNK-BP could be included in an apparent attempt to head off a row, but a top Rosneft executive scoffed at the idea. The BP-Rosneft deal centers on an Arctic exploration venture and share swap. Rosneft told Reuters Friday it was not aware BP had made an offer to TNK-BP. BP declined to comment. Barsky also said he hoped differences between BP and Russian shareholders in TNK-BP would be soon resolved. Under a shareholders' agreement between BP and a Moscow-based consortium of investors with whom it evenly divides control of No. 3 Russian oil producer TNK-BP, the TNK-BP board has rights to determine whether to allow BP to engage in projects in Russia. Industry sources have said AAR, representing tycoons Mikhail Fridman, German Khan, Viktor Vekselberg and Len Blavatnik, is trying to get a piece of the action in the Arctic or to partner with BP abroad. TNK-BP's Siberian operations are facing slow growth and face a "peak oil" scenario going into the 2020s. (Additional reporting by Vladimir Soldatkin; Editing by Hans Peters and  Andrew Callus )
