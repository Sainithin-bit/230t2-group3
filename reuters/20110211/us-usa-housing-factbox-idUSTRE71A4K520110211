 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Obama administration unveiled on Friday a plan to unwind the government-controlled mortgage buyers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Below are the administration's short term steps to reduce the government's role in the $10.6 trillion mortgage market. 

 * Reduce conforming loan limits or the size of the mortgages that the Federal Housing Administration, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can guarantee * Force borrowers to make at least a 10 percent down payment on their houses. This would be phased in gradually so that any mortgage that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guarantees eventually has at least a 10 percent down payment * Wind down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's investment portfolio at an annual rate of no less than 10 percent a year. Fannie and Freddie together hold $1.5 trillion of outstanding mortgages. * Increase the price of the Federal Housing Administration's annual mortgage insurance premium by 25 basis points * Create a "task force" to coordinate and consolidate existing housing finance agencies: the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the housing finance programs at the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Veterans' Affairs (Reporting by  Rachelle Younglai , editing by Andrew Hay)
