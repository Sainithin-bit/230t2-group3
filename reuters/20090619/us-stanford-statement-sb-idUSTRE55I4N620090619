 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - Texas billionaire Allen Stanford is innocent of U.S. charges that he bilked investors out of billions of dollars and is confident a jury will absolve him, his lawyer said on Friday. 

 "Allen Stanford will continue to fight those allegations," Stanford's lawyer Dick DeGuerin said in a statement. "He is confident that a fair jury will find him not guilty of any criminal wrongdoing."
