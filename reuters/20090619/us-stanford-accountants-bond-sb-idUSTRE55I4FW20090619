 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Friday set a bond of $100,000 for two accountants accused of helping Texas billionaire Allen Stanford falsify documents in a massive fraud case. 

 U.S. Magistrate Judge Frances Stacy set the bond for Gilberto Lopez and Mark Kuhrt, accused by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission of reverse-engineering financial statements from Stanford's Antigua bank to report nonexistent income. (Reporting by  Eileen O'Grady )
