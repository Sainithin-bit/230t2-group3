 PARIS  (Reuters) - Air France-KLM, Europe's biggest airline, may need to cut a further 3,000 jobs but only through natural attrition, its chief executive said on Friday. 

 Asked to comment on a report in French daily Le Parisien that Air France planned a further 3,000 job cuts, Pierre-Henri Gourgeon told RTL radio: "It may be of that order. For a company of 100,000 people, it's a 2-3 percent evolution. "It's what happened last year. It's our goal and it's based on natural departures," he said In April, Air France-KLM said it aimed to cut 2,500-3,000 jobs in the next two financial years. Gourgeon would not confirm that the Franco-Dutch airline was also considering temporary lay-offs to adjust to the global economic downturn. "We are reviewing all options. I have nothing specific to confirm on that issue. I do not know," he said, adding that the economic outlook was unclear. (Reporting by Dominique Vidalon; Editing by Dan Lalor)
