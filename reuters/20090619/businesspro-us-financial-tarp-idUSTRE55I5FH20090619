 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Friday confirmed Herb Allison, the former chief executive of mortgage finance company Fannie Mae, as assistant Treasury secretary to oversee the government's $700 billion bank bailout fund. 

 Allison, had led Fannie Mae FNM.P after the Treasury Department seized it last September to avert a collapse. He will replace Neel Kashkari, who was appointed to oversee the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) by the former Bush administration but who had stayed on until early May.
