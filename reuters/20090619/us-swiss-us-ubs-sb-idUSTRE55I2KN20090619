 ZURICH  (Reuters) - The Swiss-U.S. double taxation agreement was never dependent on the court case against Swiss bank UBS, a spokesman for the Swiss Finance Ministry said on Friday. 

 "It has never been the idea to integrate a solution to the UBS case in the double taxation agreement or to make the agreement dependent on such a solution," a finance ministry spokesman said. "It is a fact that Swiss finance minister Hans-Rudolf Merz has made clear to his U.S. counterpart (Timothy) Geithner, that it would be extremely difficult, to get a double taxation agreement through parliament as long as there is no solution in this case," he said.
