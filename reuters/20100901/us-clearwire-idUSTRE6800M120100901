 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Sprint Nextel's ( S.N ) board of directors is debating whether to let a rival operator invest in its majority-owned wireless network provider Clearwire Corp CLWR.O, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter. 

 Sprint's board is debating whether to let T-Mobile USA invest in Clearwire, although T-Mobile USA hasn't put a proposal on the table, the paper reported. Clearwire has said it could announce new funding by the end of the fourth quarter and it is in talks with new and existing investors. While Clearwire has enough funding for the first phase of its network construction, the company has long said it would need more cash to go beyond its plans to cover to markets with more than 120 million customers by the end of this year. T-Mobile USA told analysts in March that it continues to look at joint venture opportunities for additional spectrum and had been talking with cable companies and with Clearwire. Clearwire's two biggest rivals are AT&T Inc ( T.N ) and Verizon Wireless, a venture of Verizon Communications ( VZ.N ) and Vodafone Group Plc ( VOD.L ). Sprint was not immediately available for comment. (Additional reporting by  Sinead Carew  in New York)
