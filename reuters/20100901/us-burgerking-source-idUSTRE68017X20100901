 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Burger King Holdings Inc BKC.N, the No. 2 U.S. hamburger chain, has been considering a possible sale and has held talks with potential buyers, a source familiar with the situation said on Wednesday. 

 The source said one potentially interested party was 3i Group Plc ( III.L ). Burger King and 3i were not available to comment. Burger King, which has a market capitalization of about $2.3 billion, has been public since May 2006. It had previously been own by private equity, which still holds a stake in the company. TPG, Bain Capital and Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) had owned Burger King after buying it from British drinks company Diageo ( DGE.L ) in 2002 for about $1.5 billion. The Wall Street Journal reported Burger King has been in talks with private equity firms in recent weeks about a possible sale. (Editing by Dan Lalor)
