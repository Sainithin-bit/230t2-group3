 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve has done "a lot" to put the economy back on course, and it is now up to Congress to put fiscal policies in place that support growth, a top Federal Reserve official said on Wednesday. 

 "Congress is where laws are written, they have the power of the purse strings, Dallas Federal Reserve President Richard Fisher told a group of business leaders in Houston. "We print money. They figure out who to take it from and where to spend it. And that's their job." For more stories on Fed policy, go to (Reporting by  Ann Saphir )
