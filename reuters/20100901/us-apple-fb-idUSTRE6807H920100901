Apple TV can be controlled through iPods, iPhones and iPads after downloading an app. Google: Google TV will allow viewers to search and watch programs from the Internet and their DVR recordings. Sony TVs and blu-ray players, as well as Logitech TVs, will come with Google TV installed. A separate stand-alone device is also available. The software has a Chrome Web browser built in so users can access whatever videos, photos, music and games are online. The Android Market will be on Google TV starting in 2011. AVAILABILITY: Apple: Chief Executive Steve Jobs said Apple TV would be available in a month, and the devices can be pre-ordered now. Google: Unknown date this fall. CONTENT: Apple: TV shows will cost 99 cents to rent, movies will cost $4.99 to $2.99 to rent. Google: All free online content can be accessed.
