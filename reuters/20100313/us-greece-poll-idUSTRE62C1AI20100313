 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Most Greeks think draconian austerity measures announced by the government earlier this month were along the right lines and many feel labor unions should not oppose them too aggressively, a poll showed. 

 Some 50.1 percent of 1,008 people surveyed by polling agency Marc for the Sunday Ethnows newspaper said the austerity package went "in the right direction." About 40 percent said labor unions should seek "social peace" until the crisis was over, while 35 percent said workers should voice their opposition without causing unrest.
