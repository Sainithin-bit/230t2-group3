 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Biotechnology company Amylin Pharmaceuticals Inc AMLN.O on Friday said it was notified of two plans to nominate directors to the company's board: one by entities associated with investor Carl Icahn and another from shareholder Black Bear Fund I. 

 Both proposed slates would include five director nominations, the company said in a statement. Icahn's nominees were listed as Alexander Denner, Thomas Deuel, Jules Haimovitz, Peter Liebert and David Sidransky in a filing on Friday at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The Icahn filing also proposes that Amylin change its jurisdiction of incorporation from Delaware to North Dakota, which it says "is the most stockholder-friendly jurisdiction in the United States." Amylin said its corporate governance committee is engaged in a process to recommend a slate for election at the company's annual meeting. Icahn, who owns nearly 9 percent of Amylin, said earlier this week he planned to nominate the directors in a move patterned after previous efforts to encourage the sale of a company.
