 DAVOS, Switzerland  (Reuters) - Nike is experiencing a sharp increase in online sales, driven in part by cost-conscious shoppers conserving gasoline, the U.S. company's chief executive said on Saturday. 

 "We've seen a fairly dramatic increase in online sales," Mark Parker told a panel at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum. Industry analysts say the online sector continues to grow as more shoppers opt to shop on the Internet for convenience and the ability to compare bargains. Nike, the world's largest athletic shoe and clothing maker, last month reported a 9 percent rise in quarterly net profit, showing its relatively resilience to the sluggish consumer environment around the world.
