 (Reuters) - U.S. federal energy regulators have threatened to fine London-based Barclays about $470 million to settle claims that the bank and its traders manipulated California energy markets, in the largest proposed fine from the agency since 2005. 
 The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's Office of Enforcement staff alleged Barclays engaged in a coordinated scheme to manipulate trading at four electricity trading points in the western United States from November 2006 to December 2008. In an order issued Wednesday, FERC said Barclays has 30 days to show why the bank should not be penalized. The following is a list of the biggest FERC civil penalties since the Energy Policy Act of 2005 significantly increased the fine the commission can impose to $1 million per day per violation from the prior cap of $10,000 a day. Since 2007, FERC has issued $302.4 million in fines, excluding the proposed Barclays fine, according to its website (FERC Civil Penalty Action website:  r.reuters.com/pec73t ) Disgorgement refers to the repayment of illegal profit.
