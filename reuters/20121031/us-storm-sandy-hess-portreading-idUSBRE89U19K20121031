 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Hess Corp. ( HES.N ) said on Wednesday that its 70,000 barrel per day refinery in Port Reading, New Jersey, remained without power after the plant was shut ahead of Hurricane Sandy on Monday. 
 A company spokeswoman said a timeline will be determined once the company knows about power restoration. (Reporting By  Janet McGurty ; Editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
