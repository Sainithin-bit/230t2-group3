 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oilfield services company Weatherford 
International Inc. ( WFT.N ) on Sunday posted a 78-percent jump 
in third-quarter profit from a year earlier on strong spending 
by oil and gas companies seeking to increase their energy 
output. 

  Net earnings were $234.2 million, or 66 cents per share, 
compared with $47.9 million, or 15 cents, in the same quarter 
last year, the Houston-based company said.  Analysts polled by Reuters had estimated earnings of 66 
cents.  Revenues jumped to a record 1.7 billion, up 58 percent from 
the same period last year, the company said.  The company's evaluation, drilling and intervention 
services business posted $1.1 billion in revenues for the 
quarter, up 75 percent from a year ago, as Canada revenues 
jumped 50 percent.  Completion and production systems posted revenues of $596.7 
million on a strong performance in Asia and seasonal recovery 
in Canada, it said.  Weatherford repurchased 6.3 million shares for $269 million 
in the quarter to bring the total under its planned $1 billion 
program to $531.5 million.  Shares in Weatherford closed down 3.6 percent at $41.05 per
