 CALGARY, Alberta  (Reuters) - Shell Canada Ltd. SHC.TO shares jumped 30 percent on Monday after parent firm Royal Dutch Shell Plc ( RDSa.L ) offered to buy the 22 percent of the company it doesn't own for C$7.7 billion. 

 Royal Dutch Shell agreed to pay C$40 a share for the minority holding in its Calgary-based unit to consolidate Shell Canada's oil sands reserves and simplify its corporate structure. Shell Canada's stock rose C$10.05 to C$42.85 early on Monday on the Toronto Stock Exchange, its highest level since April. Shell Canada said it had received the offer from its parent company and had appointed a special committee of independent shareholders to review the bid.
