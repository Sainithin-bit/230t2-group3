 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) said on Monday that October sales at stores open at least a year were up about 1 percent so far, below its forecast for 2 percent to 4 percent growth. 

 "We're certainly not pleased with that," Eduardo Castro-Wright, Wal-Mart's U.S. chief executive, said at an analysts' meeting on Monday.
