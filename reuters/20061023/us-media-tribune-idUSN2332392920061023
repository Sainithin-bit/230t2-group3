 PHILADELPHIA  (Reuters) - Several major private-equity firms are considering joining together to bid for media company Tribune Co. TRB.N, a source familiar with the situation said on Monday. 

 One group consists of Madison Dearborn Partners, Providence Equity Partners and Apollo Management, the source said. A second includes Thomas H. Lee Partners and Texas Pacific Group, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal. The Carlyle Group also has eyed Tribune, but it is unclear whether it will participate on its own or jump into a different bidding camp, the newspaper said. Tribune is trying to sell itself amid weak financial results, an uncertain future and a divided board of directors. Last week, the company lower-than-expected third-quarter revenue, joining other newspaper publishers in reporting weak advertising sales. Chicago-based Tribune has been under pressure as its largest shareholder, the Chandler Trusts, has urged the company to consider selling itself or jettisoning divisions to boost value. Tribune has said it was considering its strategic options, which analysts say include going private, finding a buyer or selling properties ranging from the L.A. Times to the Chicago Cubs baseball team. The company has asked that bidders submit nonbinding indications of interest by the end of the month, the Wall Street Journal said. Texas Pacific Group and Tribune declined to comment. Madison Dearborn, Providence, Apollo, Carlyle and Thomas H. Lee could not be immediately reached for comment. Shares of Tribune gained 81 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $33.12 in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
