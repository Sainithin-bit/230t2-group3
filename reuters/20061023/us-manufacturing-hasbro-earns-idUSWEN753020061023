 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Hasbro Inc. HAS.N on Monday reported higher-than-expected third-quarter profit as it benefited from sales of its Littlest Pet Shop and Playskool toys and the introduction of a new edition of its Monopoly game. 

 The results come a week after top U.S. toymaker Mattel also posted quarterly profit that surpassed Wall Street targets, boosting hopes for a strong fourth-quarter for U.S. toy makers after years of lagging sales. "I feel good about our outlook for the all-important holiday season," Hasbro Chief Executive Officer Alfred Verrecchia said on a conference call with analysts. Hasbro shares rose 3.4 percent to $24.10 in morning New York Stock Exchange trade. The shares had risen 15 percent year-to-date through Friday, while Mattel shares had gained 37 percent. Hasbro, the No. 2 U.S. toymaker, said quarterly earnings rose to $99.6 million, or 58 cents per share, from $92.1 million, or 47 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had been expecting 50 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue increased 5 percent to $1.04 billion, beating analysts' average target of $970 million. Hasbro's North American segment revenue, which includes sales of toys like Littlest Pet Shop, Playskool and Monopoly in the United States, Canada and Mexico, rose to $745.5 million from $712.3 million. The toy company said it shipped $69 million of "Star Wars" merchandise in the quarter, down $58 million from a year earlier. In 2005, sales of "Star Wars" items like lightsabers and action figures accounted for 16 percent of Hasbro's revenue, boosted by the May 2005 release of the film "Star Wars: Episode III-Revenge of the Sith." Sales of "Star Wars" products were expected to fall this year with no new movie set for release, but they have not declined as strongly as expected. "I think Star Wars is really the Energizer Bunny of the toy industry. It just keeps going," said Gerrick Johnson, a toy analyst with BMO Capital Markets. SIGNS OF REVITALIZATION U.S. toymakers have faced years of lackluster sales, squeezed by higher manufacturing costs, intense price competition and electronic gadgets that are attracting children at younger and younger ages. But market research firm NPD Group says it is seeing signs of revitalization in the nation's $22 billion toy market. "The retail climate is better than we anticipated," Hasbro's Verrecchia said. "Most major retailers around the globe are cautiously optimistic about the holiday season. Thus far, the consumer has been spending, with retailers having a good back-to-school season." Mattel's quarterly results were boosted by the introduction of its T.M.X. Elmo plush red doll, which has already become one of the season's hottest toys, and improving sales of Barbie. Hasbro said it was seeing a strong response to the Monopoly: Here & Now Edition, released in September. The game is updated to resemble the present-day United States, with modern-day property values and playing pieces like a Toyota Prius and New Balance shoe. Hasbro's international segment revenue rose to $280.4 million, including a $9.3 million favorable impact from foreign exchange, from $264.6 million a year earlier. Hasbro is working to decrease its dependence on Star Wars merchandise and could see strong sales of other movie-related products in 2007. The Transformers movie, based on its action figures, is set for release next summer. Hasbro also expects to add more toys in 2007 from its licensing deal with Marvel Entertainment Inc. MVL.N, the owner of characters like Spider-Man, Fantastic Four, X-Men and Captain America. The film Spider-Man 3 will hit theaters in 2007. Separately, Hasbro said it repurchased 6.6 million shares of common stock during the third quarter. Since June 2005, it has repurchased 23.5 million shares.
