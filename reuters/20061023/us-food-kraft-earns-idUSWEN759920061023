 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Kraft Foods Inc. KFT.N on Monday posted lower-than-expected sales growth due to weak sales of salad dressing and bottled beverages, dragging its stock down despite an 11 percent increase in quarterly profit. 

 The company also raised its earnings outlook for the year, but only due to the expected gain from the sale of its Minute Rice brand. The maker of Oreo cookies, Maxwell House coffee and Kraft cheese posted a profit of $748 million, or 45 cents a share, in the third quarter, compared with $674 million, or 40 cents, a year earlier. Excluding items, Kraft earned 46 cents a share, compared with Wall Street analysts' average forecast of 45 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 2.3 percent to $8.24 billion. Analysts had been expecting revenue of $8.26 billion. Volume, a measure of goods sold, fell 1.9 percent. The revenue increase was smaller than the company reported for the second quarter. Some analysts were disappointed the company is not showing more steady improvement as it restructures. "You take two steps forward and one step back," said Gregg Warren, analyst at Morningstar. The company's sales were hurt by a 9 percent decline in North American ready-to-drink beverages like Fruit2O water and by consumers shying away from salads amid a massive recall of spinach due to deadly e.coli bacteria and a smaller recall of lettuce. "This has been a tough year for salad dressings because of all the consumer news in lettuce and spinach," Kraft Chief Executive Officer Irene Rosenfeld said in an interview. She added that "ready-to-drink (beverage) has been a competitive area and we have just not had the performance we expected." At the same time, the company has not produced the blockbuster new products it needs to keep growing, especially given its already large size. Aside from the company's South Beach Diet products, the last successful major new line was DiGiorno pizza in the 1990s, Warren said. "When you are a $32 billion company, you need a good handful of those to drive the needle," Warren said. Rosenfeld also was critical of the new product pipeline during a conference call with analysts, saying the company had successful products but others that were not real innovations. "Too many of our innovations are what we would characterize as new to Kraft, but not new to the world," Rosenfeld said. Kraft has been in the process of closing plants and cutting jobs in order to rein in costs amid higher prices for energy, wheat and other commodities. It has also sold off some brands to focus on products like cookies, beverages and South Beach Diet meals. Analysts and investors await an announcement from Kraft's parent, Altria Group Inc. ( MO.N ), on when it plans to spin off the rest of Kraft's stock and word from Rosenfeld about her strategy for running the largest North American food company. Rosenfeld, named CEO in June, declined to comment on specifics of her strategy for the company, saying she will talk more about her plans early next year. But she did say that the company would be ready to be spun off by Altria when the parent company decides to split Kraft and its Philip Morris tobacco businesses. Altria management has not said when the spin-off will happen, saying it is waiting for the U.S. legal environment in the tobacco business to improve. "I am highly confident that whenever and if Altria decides to spin off Kraft, we will be ready," Rosenfeld said. Kraft raised its full-year earnings outlook to between $1.86 and $1.89 a share due to gains from the sale of its Minute Rice brand and its interest in United Biscuits. In July, the company boosted its forecast to $1.78 to $1.83 a share. Kraft shares were down 4 percent at $34.80 in extended trade Monday following the earnings release, after closing up 2.3 percent at $36.30 on the New York Stock Exchange. As of Friday's close, Kraft shares were up 28.6 percent this year, compared with a 10 percent increase of the Standard & Poor's Packaged Foods index .15GSPFOOD.
