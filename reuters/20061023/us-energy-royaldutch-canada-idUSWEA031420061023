 CALGARY/LONDON  (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell Plc ( RDSa.L ) has offered to buy the 22 percent of Shell Canada Ltd. SHC.TO it doesn't already own for C$7.7 billion ($6.8 billion) to halt a slide in its reserves and expand its oil sands holdings, but one shareholder has said the offer is inadequate. 

 Shell said in a statement on Monday it had advised the board of Shell Canada of its intention to buy out the minority interests for a cash price of C$40 a share, a 22 percent premium to Friday's closing price. Struggling to rebuild its oil and gas reserves base after a more than 30 percent writedown in 2004 and poor exploration success in 2005, Shell has made massive investments in Canada's oil sands, both directly and through Shell Canada. If it is successful with its offer, Shell will consolidate the oil sands operations of its Canadian unit, Canada's No. 3 oil producer and refiner, and simplify its structure by consolidating a rare publicly traded subsidiary. As well, it will add Shell Canada's 936 million barrels of proved and probable oil sands reserves . "Once Shell Canada Limited is fully combined with the group, the business will benefit from a simplified organization, additional economies of scale and portfolio development in the context of the group's global strategy," Royal Dutch Shell said in a statement. Shell Canada is the country's third-largest oil sands producer and is in the midst of plans to expand its operations in Northern Alberta. The Athabasca oil sands contain about 174 billion barrels of recoverable heavy oil, the largest untapped resource outside Saudi Arabia. However, the heavy oil is difficult to extract and expensive to refine. Costs are also skyrocketing as a number of projects compete for materials and skilled labor. In July, Shell Canada rattled the industry and investors with word that the cost of a 100,000-barrel-a-day expansion of its Athabasca oil sands development had nearly doubled to as much as C$12.8 billion. Shell Canada shares jumped C$9.75, or 30 percent, to C$42.55 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Volume was about 24.4 million shares. Before the offer, Shell Canada's stock had lost about 22 percent since the start of the year as the price of oil dropped and cost overruns deterred investors. C$40 'NOT SUFFICIENT' However, the bid is too low, according to one of the largest outside investors in Shell Canada. Garey Aitken, a portfolio manager at Bissett Investment Management in Calgary, which controls 3.7 million Shell Canada shares, said the $40 offer would need to be raised. "I think, without having run all the numbers, that C$40 is not sufficient here," Aitken said. Still, one analyst said the offer was fair, given the costs of expanding the oil sands operations. "I think $40 is pretty fair," said Martin Molyneaux, an analyst at FirstEnergy Capital in Calgary. Shares in other oil sands firms also rose on news of the Shell offer. Imperial Oil Ltd. ( IMO.TO ), 69.6 percent owned by Exxon Mobil Corp. ( XOM.N ), rose the most, gaining C$1.87, or 5.1 percent, to C$38.37, while Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. ( CNQ.TO ), which is building the Horizon oil sand project, climbed C$1.68, or 3 percent, to C$57.08. Royal Dutch Shell's A shares fell 3 pence to 1763 pence in London. Under Chief Executive Clive Mather, Shell Canada has beefed up its oil sands holdings by acquiring BlackRock Ventures for C$2.4 billion last summer and setting long-term plans for its own Alberta bitumen leases. Its long-term goal is to produce 500,000 barrels a day of crude from the oil sands. Among its other operations, the company has a stake in the proposed Mackenzie Valley gas pipeline in Canada's Arctic, which is also being hit with surging costs, and the Sable gas offshore project on the Atlantic coast. It also runs one of the country's largest gasoline retail chains along with three refineries. Analysts said that while this deal would not boost production, as Shell Canada's output is already fully included in Shell's overall numbers, it could lead to accelerated expansion and higher output in the future. "It does raise Shell's exposure to Canadian tar sands, a high cost and overheated area, but one that offers material resource opportunity for a company struggling to grow production and rebuild its upstream," Citigroup said in a research note.
