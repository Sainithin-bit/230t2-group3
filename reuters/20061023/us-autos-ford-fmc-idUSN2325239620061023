 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co. has no plans to sell its finance arm although the automaker is open to partnerships in some markets, a senior executive said on Monday. 

 "Ford Credit is core asset, a strategic asset and we intend to hold onto it," Ford Chief Financial Officer Don Leclair said on Monday. But: "There's certain areas where having a complete full-line captive finance company doesn't make as much sense," Leclair said in response to questions from analysts on a conference call to discuss the company's third-quarter results. He cited a partnership Ford now has in Brazil that generates loan origination fees for the automaker's finance arm, while lowering its funding costs, as a model that could be exported to other markets. Some Wall Street analysts have urged Ford to sell its finance arm Ford Motor Credit to raise cash for the restructuring of its loss-making auto operations.
