 MELBOURNE  (Reuters) - Foster's Group Ltd. FGL.AX, 
Australia's largest alcoholic drinks company, said on Monday it 
remained confident of hitting its financial targets. 

  Foster's, which posted a 15 percent rise in fiscal 2006 
earnings before one-off items, said in August it expected 
earnings growth to accelerate this year.  Chairman Frank Swan said on Monday there would be some 
increase in input costs as a result of drought in Australia and 
some parts of the northern hemisphere, but it should not affect 
the company's target for double-digit earnings per share 
growth.  "There are some pressures in relation to the supply of 
grains for beer, but they have been taken into account, in the 
case of wine it is a little bit too early to tell," he said.  "Certainly if the drought continues then we would expect 
there would be a reduced grape harvest this year. In any event 
we believe the quality will still be very good."  Foster's shares added 0.9 percent to A$6.42 in afternoon 
trade in a wider market up 0.1 percent. Its shares have rallied 
about 15 percent for the calendar year to date, driven partly 
by takeover speculation.  Swan said the impact of the speculation had delayed the 
start of a A$200 million on-market share buy-back program.  "We continue to monitor the situation closely and intend to 
commence buyback activity as soon as speculation subsides," 
Swan said.  He also told the meeting that wine volumes in the Americas 
were improving, UK volume growth was well ahead of last year, 
but Australia was affected by the company's shift to a 
multi-beverage sales force model.  "Globally wine volumes continue to improve and we remain 
confident of achieving category growth levels by the end of 
this financial year," he said.  ($1=A$1.32)
