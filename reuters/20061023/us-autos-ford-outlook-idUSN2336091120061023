 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co. expects fourth-quarter operating results to be weaker than the third quarter's, the automaker's chief financial officer said on Monday. 

 Ford posted a third-quarter operating loss of 62 cents per share earlier on Monday. Ford Chief Financial Officer Don Leclair said that the automaker would start to see the cost-savings from its planned job cuts reflected in 2007, although it expected that still-high commodity prices would remain a "drag" on results next year. Leclair said Ford had received "many, many" inquiries from potential buyers for its British luxury brand Aston Martin but did not expect to close any sale of the unit this year.
