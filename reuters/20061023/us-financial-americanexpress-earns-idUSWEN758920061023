 (Corrects first paragraph to show that third-quarter profit from continuing operations rose 11 percent, not operating profit)    

 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - American Express Co. ( AXP.N ) on Monday said third-quarter profit from continuing operations rose 11 percent, as the No. 4 U.S. credit card issuer signed up more customers. Income from continuing operations, which excludes results from the Ameriprise Financial advisory unit spun off last year, rose to $956 million, or 78 cents a share, from $865 million, or 69 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts had on average expected earnings before special items of 76 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. American Express' market share in credit cards has been growing compared with competitors like MasterCard Inc.( MA.N ), after a legal ruling last year allowed banks and other finance companies to begin issuing American Express cards. The company's shares had risen nearly 13 percent this year through Friday, outstripping the Dow Jones U.S. consumer finance index .DJUSSF, which had risen just 3.4 percent.
