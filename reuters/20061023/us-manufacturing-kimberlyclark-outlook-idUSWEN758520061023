 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Kimberly-Clark Corp. ( KMB.N ) expects costs to be up at least $350 million, more than previously forecast, due to higher costs for materials such as pulp and polymer, the company said on Monday. 

 The maker of products such as Kleenex tissues and Scott paper towels originally forecast cost rises of $200 million, and in July had said it expected it to rise by $300 million to $350 million. Chief Financial Officer Mark Buthman said that the company still expects to spend $750 million on share repurchases this year, and $900 million to $1 billion on capital spending.
