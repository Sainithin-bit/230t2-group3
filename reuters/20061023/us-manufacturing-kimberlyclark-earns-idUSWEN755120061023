 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Kimberly-Clark Corp. ( KMB.N ), the maker of Kleenex tissues and Huggies diapers, on Monday said third-quarter profit rose nearly 12 percent, but the quality of the results failed to impress Wall Street and its shares fell more than 2 percent. 

 Kimberly-Clark also said its full-year profit should come in toward the lower end of prior expectations as it continues to feel pressure from higher costs for materials such as pulp. Such costs should be up more than $350 million this year, even though oil costs have fallen, Chairman and Chief Executive Thomas Falk said during a conference call. That's up from the company's original estimate of $200 million and the $300 million to $350 million forecast it gave in July. Kimberly-Clark is 15 months into a restructuring plan that includes cutting 6,000 jobs as it works to improve its diaper and health-care businesses and expand in emerging markets. The company's report was the first look at quarterly results from a major U.S. household and personal care products company, with others, such as leader Procter & Gamble Co. ( PG.N ), expected to report in the coming days. "We are not thrilled with operating performance," said AG Edwards analyst Jason Gere, who rates the shares "buy." Profit rose to $364.2 million, or 79 cents per share, from $325.3 million, or 68 cents per share, a year earlier. Kimberly-Clark attributed much of the increase to cost-cuts and growth at Mexico's Kimber ( KIMBERA.MX ), in which it holds a minority stake. Before items, the Dallas-based company, which also makes Cottonelle, Scott and Viva paper products, earned 99 cents per share. Analysts had an average estimate of 98 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Morgan Stanley analyst Bill Pecoriello, who has an "underweight" rating on the shares, said that lower taxes and options added to the profit. Based on core operating profit, excluding charges and options, the results missed the Wall Street consensus by 2 cents per share, he said. Kimberly-Clark's sales rose 5.2 percent to $4.2 billion, driven by sales growth in each of the company's segments. But analysts said the sales growth was weak, excluding a boost of nearly 2 percent from foreign exchange rates. Bear Stearns analyst Justin Hott said that Kimberly-Clark's 3 percent "organic" sales growth is below expectations for a company in this sector. "It supports the argument that Kimberly is in the wrong categories (e.g. tissue, diapers) and competitive set (P&G) for growth," said Hott, who rates the shares "peer perform." Kimberly-Clark competes directly with P&G's Pampers and Luvs diapers, Puffs tissues, Bounty paper towels, Charmin bathroom tissue and Tampax and Always feminine care products. The company said it is still working on turning around its Kotex women's business, where volume declined, including new products that should hit stores in the current quarter. Consumer tissue volume also fell, but higher prices and currency led to a 3 percent sales increase. The company expects to earn $1 per share to $1.02 per share in the fourth quarter, and analysts, on average, call for a profit of $1.02 per share. Kimberly-Clark said it now expects to earn $3.87 per share to $3.89 per share this year. It had previously forecast a profit of $3.85 per share to $3.95 per share, and analysts expect a profit of $3.88 per share. The company said it plans to give a 2007 preview when it reports fourth-quarter results in late January. Shares of Kimberly-Clark were down 63 cents, or 0.9 percent, at $66.79 after falling to $65.89 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares rose 6 percent during the quarter, while the six-company S&P Household & Personal Products Index .GSPHHPE, which includes Kimberly-Clark, rose 8.9 percent.
