 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - American Express Co. ( AXP.N ) said on Monday its third-quarter profit from continuing operations rose 11 percent, as the No. 4 U.S. credit card issuer signed up more customers and cardholders spent more. 

 Revenue fell short of analysts' expectations, and even though earnings exceeded analysts' estimates, some investors sold shares. American Express shares staged their biggest one-day drop in percentage terms since October 2005. "These numbers are everything I had been hoping for, but we've had a great run in the stock, and some people think it's a good time to take profits," said Michael Holland, chairman of investment firm Holland & Co., which has over $1 billion of assets including American Express shares. American Express shares, even with Monday's declines, are hovering near their 52-week highs, and have been rising steeply since July. Income from continuing operations, which excludes results from the Ameriprise Financial ( AMP.N ) advisory unit spun off last year, rose to $956 million, or 78 cents a share in the quarter ended September 30, from $865 million, or 69 cents a share in the same quarter last year. Excluding a $33 million gain from the sale of operations in Malaysia and Indonesia, and $12 million of restructuring costs, income from continuing operations was 77 cents per share, or a penny better than average analyst expectations, according to Reuters Estimates. Credit card issuers including Capital One Financial Corp. ( COF.N ) and Citigroup ( C.N ) have reported strong results from their credit card operations this quarter compared to the same quarter last year, helped by low write-offs of bad loans and in many cases rising consumer borrowing. But write-offs of bad loans are likely to creep higher in coming quarters as bankruptcy filings creep higher, Gary Crittenden, chief financial officer, said on a conference call with analysts. Personal bankruptcy filings have been low in recent quarters, after spiking just before a new law went into effect last year. American Express has performed well for its sector, analysts said. The company's market share in credit cards has been growing compared with rival processors like MasterCard Inc. ( MA.N ), after a legal ruling allowed banks and other finance companies to begin issuing American Express cards in the United States. American Express had about 23.2 percent of U.S. credit card purchase volume at mid year, up from 22.5 percent a year earlier, according to the Nilson Report, a credit card research publication. SPENDING UP, BUT REVENUE MISSES Revenue for the quarter was $6.76 billion, up from $6.02 billion a year ago. Analysts had on average expected revenue of $6.87 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. The company added 2 million credit- and charge-card customers during the quarter, after adding 1.7 million customers in the third quarter of 2005. Average quarterly spending was $2,770 per cardholder, up from $2,610 a year earlier. Marketing promotion, rewards, and other expenses rose 7 percent to $1.59 billion. Return on equity was 33.6 percent during the quarter, up from 24.2 percent a year earlier. American Express shares fell $1.39 to $56.65. But shares are still close to their 52-week high close of $58.10, reached on October 17. The company's shares have risen 10 percent this year, outstripping the Dow Jones U.S. consumer finance index .DJUSSF, which had risen a little more than 2 percent.
