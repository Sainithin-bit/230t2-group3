 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Australia's Macquarie Bank Ltd. MBL.AX, fresh from snapping up Thames Water last week, on Monday unveiled an unsolicited bid for Germany's Techem TNHG.DE at 44 euros a share, valuing the water metering firm at around 1.1 billion euros ($1.4 billion). 

 A Macquarie spokeswoman said its Macquarie European Infrastructure Fund II (MEIF II) had already acquired a 17 percent stake in Techem. Techem's shares jumped on the news and were 11.3 percent higher at 0732 GMT, outperforming a slightly higher German midcap index .MDAX. A Techem spokesman said the company would discuss the offer and respond in due course. The takeover offer comes a week after a group led by Macquarie unexpectedly won the battle to buy UK utility Thames Water from Germany's biggest power firm RWE ( RWEG.DE ) for 4.8 billion pounds ($9 billion), excluding debt. "We are aiming for a majority position," the spokeswoman said. Techem's free float is close to 95 percent, according to Reuters data. The offer price is at an 18.9 percent premium to the average price of Techem's shares over the past 3 months, and 4 percent above its Friday closing price. Macquarie also said it would seek support from Techem management for its offer and was interested in working with the current management in future. "This is an attractive offer that we believe is in the best interests of shareholders and the company," Martin Stanley, executive director of Macquarie Bank, said in a statement. Stanley, who is responsible for the bank's European Infrastructure Funds, said: "Macquarie is offering shareholders the opportunity to achieve a full, cash price -- or retain a low-yielding investment." Techem provides energy and water metering services for some 7.4 million households in Europe. The bank also said it would retain the Techem brand and its location, adding that it had no plans to restructure Techem further. Macquarie's offer comes after Techem said last week it would reject a possible approach by financial investors in case of any offer.
