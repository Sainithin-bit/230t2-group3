 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - U.S. venture capital funding rose 5.4 percent in the first nine months of this year compared with 2005, led by investments in alternative energy and Internet technologies, a survey due out on Monday said. 

 Venture capital investors directed $6.36 billion into 611 deals through the end of September, according to a quarterly report by Dow Jones VentureOne and Ernst & Young LLP. With $19.45 billion invested during the first three quarters, the U.S. venture industry is on track to spend around $25 billion in 2006, marking the biggest year since 2001, when $33 billion was invested. "This is the first time since 2001 that we have seen three consecutive quarters in which investments exceeded $6 billion," said Joseph Muscat, Americas director of the Ernst & Young Venture Capital Advisory Group. Current levels are a little over one-third of the $63.4 billion spent in 2000 -- the peak year of the dot-com boom. Financings tripled for alternative energy companies, as venture capitalists backed 14 deals worth $110.2 million. Funding for information technology -- especially the latest generation of Internet start-ups known as "Web 2.0" -- grew 41 percent during the third quarter from the year-earlier period. More than $35 billion in new funds has been raised over the last 18 months, the VentureOne survey found. Thirty-eight percent of investment rounds in the latest quarter went to seed- or first-stage financings, the first quarter this year early-stage investment has outpaced later-stage rounds. Early-stage funding is up 13 percent over last year, led by health-care themes like biopharmaceuticals. Investors have taken heart from a lively acquisition market as larger buyers snap up smaller companies and from a recent pick-up in public markets for technology initial public offerings, VentureOne and Ernst & Young stated. But that contradicts recent data from Thomson Financial and the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA) that shows how only eight venture-backed companies raised $934.2 million via IPOs in the third quarter, the slowest quarter since 2003. By contrast, in the second quarter, 19 venture companies raised more than $2 billion. VC-backed acquisitions in the latest quarter also fell, with 74 companies acquired for a value of $2.7 billion, according to the NVCA/Thomson data.
