 CALGARY, Alberta  (Reuters) - One of Shell Canada Ltd.'s SHC.TO largest minority shareholders said on Monday the C$40-per-share bid for the company by parent firm Royal Dutch Shell Plc ( RDSa.L ) is inadequate. 

 Garey Aitken, a portfolio manager at Bissett Investment Management in Calgary, Alberta, which controls 3.7 million Shell Canada shares, said the offer for the 22 percent of the company Royal Dutch Shell doesn't own won't be enough. "I think, without having run all the numbers, that C$40 (a share) is not sufficient here," Aitken said. "A lot of the shareholders, like ourselves, will have to carefully weigh this. The bid is better than what we saw the stock (close at) on Friday, but my feeling is it's not sufficient." Shell Canada shares jumped C$9.41, or 29 percent, to C$42.22 in midday trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange. ($1=$1.13 Canadian)
