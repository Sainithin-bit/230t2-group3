 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia, the world's top crude exporter, has told two Japanese refiners that it will cut November crude supplies by 7-to-8 percent from contracted volumes, industry sources said on Monday. 

 "Our company received notification from Saudi Arabia at the weekend," one source said. The notifications were the first indication of the latest OPEC cut after the organization last week decided to curb output for the first time since 2004, lowering it by 1.2 million barrels per day from November.
