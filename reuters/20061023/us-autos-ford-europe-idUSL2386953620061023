 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co is still weighing what to do with its loss-making stable of European premium brands, which now have to prove they can make consistent profits, Chief Executive Alan Mulally said on Monday. 

 While Ford had done the right thing so far by investing in new vehicles, quality and productivity at its Premier Automotive Group (PAG), the new CEO said, he did not commit himself to maintaining the Jaguar, Volvo and Land Rover brands. "No, I don't," Mulally said when asked during a conference call if he had a feeling yet on whether to keep the brands. "I really think it's going to hinge on how the businesses are doing and can we make profitable growth businesses out of them with the action we have taken and additional actions that might be required." PAG's pretax loss excluding one-off items widened to $593 million in the third quarter from $108 million for the same period in 2005 as the unit set aside money for Jaguar and Land Rover warranty costs, something Mulally called "a setback". Also sales volumes dropped for all the PAG brands except Aston Martin, which Ford has already put up for sale. Mulally, who became Ford CEO just last month, said the number two U.S. carmaker had a good plan in place to increase the PAG brands' value in the long term but that their future with the group was subject to "continuing evaluation". Ford has said in the past that only Aston Martin is a candidate for divestment at this stage. Chief Financial Officer Don Leclair told the call that Ford had received "many, many inquiries" about Aston Martin and was in the process of winnowing suitors down to a short list. "There is a lot of interest, and we feel very good about how the process is going," he said, although he added that no sale was expected by the end of this year. Leclair also forecast that PAG's results would improve substantially in the fourth quarter to near breakeven given higher production volumes and product launches from Volvo and Land Rover.
