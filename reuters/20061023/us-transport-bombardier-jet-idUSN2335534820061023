 MONTREAL  (Reuters) - Bombardier Inc. ( BBDb.TO ) could decide by yearend to revive its dormant plan to build a new 110- to 130-passenger jet, an analyst said on Monday. 

 Jacques Kavafian, analyst at Research Capital, said Bombardier may launch the $2 billion CSeries program for the  110- to 130-seater in conjunction with its proposed $300 million plan for a 98-seat stretch version of its 86-seat  CRJ900. Kavafian said he agreed with Bombardier's view that there is a global market over 20 years for some 5,000 aircraft seating 100 to 135 passengers. Many of the aircraft built in the past to serve the lower end of the range, 100 to 120 seats, are not economical, and the world's leading jet makers, Boeing Co. ( BA.N ) and Airbus ( EAD.PA ) have not been successful in filling the gap, he said. "The market that the CSeries targets exists, and no other airframe manufacturer has ventured into the category so far," Kavafian wrote in a research report. Bombardier halted the CSeries project in late January, saying it could not find enough customers to launch the development program. The company, which is the world's third-largest civil aircraft maker and the No. 1 maker of trains, has said the program is simply on hold, not abandoned, and that it ultimately could decide to go ahead with it. Kavafian cautioned that Boeing could aim at the CSeries potential market after discontinuing its 717 jet earlier this year. There has been speculation that Bombardier's Brazilian rival, Embraer SA ( EMBR3.SA ), is looking at an E200 Series that would target the same category. Kavafian said Bombardier could go ahead with the CSeries without locking in a major airline as launch customer. "Given that it would take five years to bring the aircraft to market, there is ample time for the company to find customers during the five-year development and construction phase," he wrote. Without a new family of jets, Bombardier's commercial aircraft business could dwindle, despite a robust market for business jets, Kavafian warned. Bombardier recently announced two big orders for its regional jets, but analysts have said the company needs to land more in the weeks ahead to avoid cutting back production. Bombardier's class B shares were off 4 Canadian cents, or 1 percent, at C$3.82 on the Toronto Stock Exchange at midday on Monday. Fitch Ratings said on Monday it may cut its ratings on Bombardier, mainly because it is concerned that the company is becoming less focused on reducing its debt. Fitch ranks Bombardier's senior unsecured debt "BB", two levels below investment grade. ($1=$1.13 Canadian)
