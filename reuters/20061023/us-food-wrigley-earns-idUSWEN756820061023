 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Chewing gum maker Wm. Wrigley Jr. Co. WWY.N on Monday went outside the Wrigley family for the first time to name a president and chief executive, surprising investors and helping send its shares up as much as 16 percent. 

 Wrigley named former Nike Inc. ( NKE.N ) CEO William Perez as president and chief executive officer, immediately replacing Bill Wrigley Jr., who will assume the new role of executive chairman. The company also said quarterly profit rose, beating analysts' estimates. Analysts said the earnings report also helped lift the stock. In addition to his new post, Bill Wrigley, 43, will remain chairman of the board of the company that his great grandfather founded. "In our view, by hiring William Perez ... as the company's CEO, Chairman Bill Wrigley Jr. sees that significant changes are needed at Wrigley, which has been our thesis," Pablo Zuanic, analyst at J.P. Morgan Securities, said in a research note. Perez, 59, has experience running a family business, having served as chief executive of household products maker S.C. Johnson & Sons from 1996 to 2004. But he moved from S.C. Johnson to Nike, where he clashed with founder and Chairman Philip Knight in a 13-month stint as chief executive of the athletic shoe and apparel company which ended in January. Still, the Wrigley job seems to be a good fit for Perez, who also brings experience selling branded consumer products in international markets. "Wrigley, like S.C Johnson, is a collection of branded products that is sold in mass channels," Mitchell Corwin, analyst at Morningstar, said. "There are more similarities between S.C. Johnson and Wrigley than S.C. Johnson and Nike. Bill Wrigley said on Monday that he will focus on long-term strategy and product innovation. Since Bill Wrigley became chief executive in 1999, the company's sales have more than doubled to more than $4 billion, with acquisitions helping to expand the company beyond chewing gum and into candies like Life Savers and Altoids mints. ACQUISITION MISSTEPS But the Chicago-based company also stumbled over the 2005 Life Savers and Altoids acquisitions from Kraft Foods Inc. KFT.N, finding that it needed to spend more than expected to increase sales of those brands. "Missteps in the Kraft acquisition highlighted the need for somebody with more experience to lead the company going forward," Morningstar's Corwin said. Wrigley has also had to take on even more day-to-day oversight of the company since April, when Chief Operating Officer Ronald Waters retired from the company early. "I think he has recognized that with a company this size, it is difficult to be the chairman, CEO and COO at the same time," said Jon Henderson, associate analyst at William Blair & Co. "I think he recognized he can't do it all." As of February 6, Wrigley controlled 19.8 million shares, or 59.59 percent of Wrigley class "B" stock, which has 10 votes for each share, in various trusts for himself and his family, according to the company's annual proxy report. He also controlled 14.2 million shares, or 7.55 percent, of the company's class "A" stock, which carries one vote per share. The change at Wrigley comes a little more than a month after Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) replaced CEO William Clay Ford Jr., the great-grandson of that company's founder. Separately, Wrigley also on Monday said third-quarter sales rose 11 percent to $1.18 billion, helped by a 30 percent increase in China and a 9 percent increase in the United States. Earnings for the period rose to $148.0 million, or 53 cents a share, from $129.7 million, or 46 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding restructuring charges, earnings were 55 cents a share. On that basis, analysts on average had forecast 51 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Wrigley shares were up $7.22 at $54.05 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. They traded as high as $54.31, which would be their largest single-day percentage gain in at least 20 years.
