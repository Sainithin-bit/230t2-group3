 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Wm. Wrigley Jr. Co. WWY.N does not expect management to be more talkative with analysts under its new chief executive, the company's chairman said on Monday. 

 "We don't see at this point in time stepping up external communications," Bill Wrigley Jr. Chairman of the board, said in answer to a question at a news conference with his successor as chief executive, William Perez. Wrigley is one of the few public companies that does not hold a conference call with analysts when it reports quarterly earnings. In fact, many analysts are in the habit of attending the company's annual meeting because it affords one of the rare opportunities for analysts to asks questions of top management. "We don't see any change. We believe we have a good process," Wrigley said. The chewing gum and candy maker on Monday named Perez to replace Wrigley as chief executive, the first person from outside the Wrigley family to hold that post.
