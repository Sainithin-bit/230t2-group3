 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Texas Instruments Inc. TXN.N 

 on Monday gave a disappointing outlook for the fourth quarter as sales of its chips for high-end cell phones were worse than expected going into the holiday shopping season. The world's biggest maker of chips for cell phones forecast fourth-quarter revenue at $3.46 billion to $3.75 billion, which was below average Wall Street estimates and also less than the third quarter's $3.76 billion. Analysts on average had forecast revenue in the fourth quarter at $3.8 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. The busiest period for wireless-chip makers typically straddles a stretch between the third and fourth quarters. TI's third-quarter sales had also missed market estimates, though profit from continuing operations was in line. "No one thing stood out as the main culprit but when you add it all together it's a little bit of a disappointment," said American Technology Research analyst Doug Freedman. TI shares fell as much as 3 percent in after-hour trading on the news before recovering to trade at $31.50, still down from their New York Stock Exchange close of $31.88. The shares had gained 51 cents, or 1.6 percent, in Monday's session. The company, which makes everything from calculators to chips for flat-screen televisions, said third-quarter revenue rose to $3.76 billion from $3.59 billion. The average forecast from analysts polled by Reuters Estimates was $3.796 billion. "People were expecting more high-end cell phones than were sold when actually they sold more low-end phones than expected," TI Chief Financial Officer Kevin March said in an interview. TI's biggest customer -- Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ), the No. 1 cell phone maker -- said last week that its average selling price for phones fell in the quarter as demand was strong for cheaper phones. Another client, Motorola Inc MOT.N, also posted disappointing growth, citing weak demand for advanced phones. March said demand for phones with fast Web links was weaker than expected in Europe. He also cited inventory corrections for high-speed phones in Japan for weaker-than-expected revenue recorded in the third quarter and expected in the fourth quarter. TI said its profit from continuing operations was $686 million, or 45 cents a share in the third quarter, up from $596 million or 36 cents a share in the year-earlier quarter and in line with analyst expectations. The company forecast fourth-quarter earnings per share from continuing operations at 40 cents to 46 cents. Average analyst expectations were 45 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Executives said on a conference call that the weaker-than-seasonal demand in its wireless business observed in the third quarter would be even more noticeable in the fourth quarter, which usually tends to see about 10 percent growth over the third quarter. March said lower-than-expected demand for more expensive phones was also a factor in its fourth-quarter outlook. "In the fourth quarter the mix of low-end versus high-end will be more skewed to the low-end," the CFO said. March said he views the slack demand for high-speed phones as a pause rather than a sign of a longer-term problem. He said the company's third-quarter book-to-bill ratio was 0.93 compared with 1.07 in the second quarter. This means that for every $100 of products shipped, $93 of new orders were booked. It was the first time in about five quarters that the company reported a ratio below 1.
