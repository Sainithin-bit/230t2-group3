 PHILADELPHIA  (Reuters) - Merrill Lynch & Co. Inc. MER.N said on Monday it agreed to buy Petrie Parkman & Co., an investment bank specializing in mergers, corporate finance, and equity research for the North American oil and gas industry. 

 The deal will allow Merrill to add greater specialization within the energy sector. In the first nine months of 2006, the utility and energy sector was the fourth most active in mergers and acquisitions, while oil and gas ranked No. 7, according to research firm Dealogic. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. The purchase is expected to close in the fourth quarter. Petrie Parkman, which operates in Houston, Denver and London and has about 50 professionals, last month filed for an initial public offering, aiming to raise up to $115 million. Keefe Bruyette & Woods had been listed as one of the underwriters. The move came as the market for oil and gas initial public offerings has contracted as oil prices slid from their peaks early this year and due to uncertainty about how natural gas prices will fare this winter. As deals have traded below their offering prices, others have been shelved. Petrie Parkman was one of the last of the larger independent energy advisory firms standing. Last year, Jefferies Group Inc. JEF.N bought Randall & Dewey, and Bank of Nova Scotia's ( BNS.TO ) Scotia Capital bought Waterous & Co., two Houston-based firms that focused on oil and gas asset sales. The move marks a return to Wall Street for the firm's founders, Jim Parkman and Tom Petrie, who started Petrie Parkman in 1989 along with head bankers Jon Hughes and Randy King. Parkman and Petrie were previously oil analysts at First Boston Corp., a predecessor to Credit Suisse Group ( CSGN.VX ), while Hughes worked in First Boston's mergers and acquisitions group. Keefe Bruyette served as adviser to Petrie Parkman in the deal with Merrill and provided a fairness opinion. Merrill represented itself. Petrie Parkman's mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, and corporate finance businesses will become part of Merrill's global markets and investment banking group. Petrie Parkman had a piece of one of this year's largest sector deals, advising Western Gas Resources Inc. WGR.N on its three-way deal to be bought by Kerr-McGee Corp. ( KMG.N ) and Anadarko Petroleum Corp. ( APC.N ). Petrie Parkman's equity research staff will become part of Merrill's global securities research and economics team.
