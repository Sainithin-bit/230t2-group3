 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Mortgage insurer MGIC Investment Corp ( MTG.N ) said on Tuesday it expects insurance payouts to generate up to $2 billion of paid losses in 2008, as the performance of mortgages it insures deteriorates. 

 MGIC also estimated incurred losses of $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2007 from insurance payouts and boosting reserves. MGIC said more loans it insures are becoming delinquent, so that more are ending up as defaults that require the insurer to make payouts to lenders. The average size of claims is also rising. The company had $211.7 billion of insurance in force at the end of 2007. At the end of the fourth quarter, 107,120 loans were delinquent, up 16,000 from the end of the third quarter. MGIC forecast 2008 paid losses of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. (Reporting by  Dan Wilchins , editing by Richard Chang)
