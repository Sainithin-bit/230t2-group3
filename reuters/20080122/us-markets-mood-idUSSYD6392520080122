 SYDNEY/HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Shell-shocked investors from Melbourne to Mumbai counted the cost to their pensions and savings as Asian stock markets tumbled on fears that recession in the United States would rock the rest of the world. 

 "I just feel sick, very sick," said retired IT manager Peter Hurst, 61, from Melbourne, who relies on investment income as well as his pension. The MSCI index of Asia-Pacific stocks outside of Japan fell as much as 8 percent on Tuesday, with India crashing nearly 13 percent at one point and Australia suffering its biggest one-day fall ever, ending down 7 percent. The rout followed big losses in Europe on Monday and signals in the futures market that New York would see a sharp fall when it reopens after Monday's holiday in the United States. "It's like a funeral in here," said Ken Masuda, senior equities dealer at Shinko Securities in Tokyo, where the Nikkei lost 5.7 percent in its biggest one-day drop since the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States. "No one knows what's going to happen tonight in New York. It's like we've gone blind, you don't know what's coming ... all we can do is sell," Masuda said. Frenzied trading by worried investors caused Australian online broker Commonwealth Securities' Web site to seize up, while the South Korean exchange suspended automated trading and India's market was suspended briefly after sharp falls. "Most of your gains you make in a year, you lose in one day. If you're caught in the market, you lose your pants. Now, cash is king," said Robin Lim, 43, a seafood trader in Singapore. Goh Seng Hiang, 70, a Singapore retiree, said he'd lost about S$50,000 (US$34,428) so far this year. "The situation is bad, I'll become a piece of deadwood soon. I'm waiting to re-enter but probably after a month or two," he said. "DEADLY MARKET" Waves of bad news have battered world markets since the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis erupted last year, and its effects have spread into the real economy, hitting companies and investors. Billionaire investor George Soros told an Austrian newspaper the world faces its worst financial crisis since World War Two. Hopes that surging Asian economies led by China and India meant that the region had "decoupled" from the United States have turned in recent weeks to fear that no markets can hide from the woes of the world's biggest economy. "This market is deadly -- you'd better stay out of it," warned retired sales manager Peter Chan, 64, who sat with other stock punters at a brokerage in bustling central Hong Kong. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index ended 8.65 percent lower, its worst one-day loss since September 2001, while the Shanghai Composite Index lost more than 7 percent. "I've been in this market since the 1980s and I've seen four crashes. The worst happened in the 1980s, when I lost all my money and my wife went away with my kids," added Chan, who said he'd already sold his stockholdings. Across the South China Sea, in a Taipei trading room of Fubon Securities, dozens of glum-faced investors stared at a large screen on the wall awash in green -- the local color code for stock losses. "Everybody was anxiously pulling their money out of stocks," said George Hsieh, who manages $370 million for Capital Investment Trust Corp in Taipei. "The global economy is crashing. The U.S. economy could head into a recession and subprime losses from European financial firms may be too big to estimate. More corrections in global stocks are on the way," he predicted. A woman surnamed Lin at a branch of E.Sun Securities in Taipei said she lost more than T$50,000 ($1,500) in two hours of trading. The main TAIEX index ended 6.5 percent lower. "Every time the market plunges, it should be a great buying opportunity," she said. "But I just don't have enough money now." Others tried to put a brave face on the market slump. "Definitely, I'm nervous and it's a bit concerning for a retiree like me. But I think the market will bounce back," said 59-year-old Sydney retiree David Lindeman.
