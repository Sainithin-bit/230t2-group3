 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp, the second-largest U.S. bank, on Tuesday said fourth-quarter profit fell, hurt by mounting credit losses and weak investment banking results. 

 Net income for the Charlotte, North Carolina-based company fell to $268 million, or 5 cents per share, from $5.26 billion, or $1.16, a year earlier. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel; Editing by John Wallace)
