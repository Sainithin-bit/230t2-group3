 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. chemical major DuPont Co said on Tuesday that fourth-quarter earnings rose before special items, helped by increased profits from its performance materials business and strong agricultural sales in Brazil. 

 However net income fell to $545 million, or 60 cents a share, from year-earlier profit of $871 million, or 94 cents a share, which included tax benefits and insurance recoveries. Excluding items, the company posted quarterly earnings of 57 cents a share, up from 45 cents a year earlier. "DuPont's strong earnings growth in the fourth quarter reflects our global presence," Chief Executive Charles Holliday said in a statement. Sales rose 11 percent to $6.98 billion, boosted by increased volumes and higher local selling prices. DuPont said it expected first-quarter earnings of $1.12 to $1.17 a share, and it affirmed its full-year earnings outlook of $3.35 to $3.55. Earlier this month, the Wilmington, Delaware-based company raised its 2008 earnings forecast on rising sales of its agricultural products in emerging markets.
