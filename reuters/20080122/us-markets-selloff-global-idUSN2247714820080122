 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Out of 52 developed and 
emerging world stock markets, 49 were lower year-to-date 
through January 21, according to Standard & Poor's. 

 Of the 49 stock markets that were lower, 43 had 
double-digit declines. Only Nigeria, Jordan and Morocco had 
gains. "What the current trend of thought appears to have 
forgotten is that the U.S. is still the 800-pound gorilla," 
Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst for S&P said in a 
commentary written last week. "While the growth is abroad, the 
major consumption, spending and markets are still in the U.S. 
America getting a cold may no longer cause the world to get 
pneumonia, but it certainly will cause a lot more than just the 
sniffles." Below is the price-only percentage change of 52 global 
markets through the close of local markets on January 21, 
calculated in U.S. dollar terms. S&P/Citigroup Global Equity Indices. YTD stock change through January 21:
