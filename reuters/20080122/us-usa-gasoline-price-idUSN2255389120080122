 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. gasoline prices sank to a one-month low, after falling 5.1 cents over the last week to $3.02 a gallon amid worries about a weak economy, the government said on Tuesday. 

 The national price for regular gasoline remained up 85 cents from a year ago, the Energy Information Administration said in its weekly survey of service stations. Lower pump prices reflect cheaper crude oil, whose price has fallen on fears a slowing economy will cut demand. "Obviously, any time an economy slows, production processes slow, inputs slow and so there's less (energy) resource utilization," U.S. Assistant Energy Secretary Andy Karsner told reporters at the Washington, D.C. Auto Show on Tuesday. "If the economy slows down, some places are going to use less energy," said former CIA Director James Woolsey, speaking at the same event. Crude oil fell as low as $86.11 a barrel on Tuesday at the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest since December 6 and down almost 14 percent from its record high of $100.09 a barrel on January 3. Crude settled at $89.85 a barrel, down 72 cents. The price of crude oil accounts for about two-thirds the cost for making gasoline. In the EIA's latest survey, gasoline cost the most on the West Coast, where it dropped 5.9 cents to $3.16 a gallon. Among major cities, San Francisco again had the highest gasoline price at $3.33, down 6.9 cents. The Gulf Coast states had the lowest price by region, at $2.90 a gallon, down 5.3 cents. Denver had the cheapest pump price at $2.83 a gallon, down 1.5 cents. The EIA also reported gasoline prices were down 6.7 cents to $3.20 in Los Angeles, down 2.9 cents at $3.18 in Miami, down 7.1 cents at $3.09 in Chicago, down 7.8 cents at $3.08 in Seattle, down 3.7 cents at $3.08 in New York City, down 2.5 cents at $3.02 in Boston and down 4.6 cents at $2.87 in Houston. Separately, the price truckers paid for diesel fuel declined 5.6 cents in the past week to $3.27 a gallon, the lowest level in three months but still up 84 cents from a year ago. The New England states had the most expensive diesel at $3.59 a gallon, down 2.7 cents. The Gulf Coast states had the most affordable diesel at $3.22, down 4.4 cents.
