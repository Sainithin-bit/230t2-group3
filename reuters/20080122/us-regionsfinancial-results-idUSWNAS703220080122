 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Regions Financial Corp ( RF.N ), a large U.S. Southeast regional bank, on Tuesday posted a lower fourth-quarter profit, hurt by higher provisioning for loan losses and non-merger-related charges. 

 Net earnings at the Birmingham, Alabama-based company were $70.6 million, or 10 cents per share, compared with a profit of $361.6 million, or 56 cents, a year earlier. (Reporting by  John Poirier ; editing by John Wallace)
