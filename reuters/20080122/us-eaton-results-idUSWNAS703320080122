 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Diversified manufacturer Eaton Corp ( ETN.N ) posted a higher quarterly profit on Tuesday, citing strength in its electrical and fluid power businesses and a lower tax rate. 

 Net income in the fourth quarter rose 6 percent $256 million, or $1.71 a share, from $241 million, or $1.59 a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, the Cleveland, Ohio-based company earned $1.79 a share. Analysts' average forecast was $1.73 per share before one-time items, on sales of $3.28 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. In October, the maker of everything from electrical switch boards to truck transmissions forecast a net profit of $1.60 to $1.70 a share. Before one-time items, it expected $1.65 to $1.75 a share.
