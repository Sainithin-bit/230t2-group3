 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Supreme Court rejected on Tuesday an appeal by Enron Corp investors seeking to proceed with a $40 billion class-action lawsuit against investment banks that put together financing deals for the energy trader, which collapsed in 2001. 

 The rejection of the Enron appeal was expected in view of the Supreme Court's ruling in a similar case on January 15 that sharply limited the ability of shareholders to sue third parties, such as financial institutions, in securities fraud cases.
