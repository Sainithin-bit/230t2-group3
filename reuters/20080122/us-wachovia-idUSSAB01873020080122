 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wachovia Corp WB.N, the fourth-largest U.S. bank, said on Tuesday quarterly profit fell a larger-than-expected 98 percent, as the bank suffered more than $3 billion of write-downs and credit losses tied to mortgage and capital markets turmoil. 

 Fourth-quarter net income fell to $51 million, or 3 cents per share, from $2.3 billion, or $1.20, a year earlier. Excluding merger costs, profit was $160 million, or 8 cents per share. On that basis, analysts on average expected profit of 32 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. "Our fourth-quarter results were poor," Chief Executive Ken Thompson said on a conference call. But he said that "with the exception of structured products and with the exception of credit issues going on in the mortgage market, every part of our company other than that is having excellent results." Results nonetheless represented a setback for Thompson, who has spent years building a big investment banking business on structured products -- a complex security that many investors are now shunning. He has also since 2006 fended off criticism for spending $24.2 billion on mortgage lender Golden West Financial Corp, just before the housing market soured. Wachovia shares fell as much as 7.8 percent to a six-year low, but rebounded after Thompson said Wachovia had no plans or need to cut its 64 cents per share dividend. In afternoon trading, the shares were up 99 cents at $31.79. Results included a $1.7 billion loss from structured products, including collateralized debt obligations. This included $1 billion tied to subprime mortgages, $600 million for commercial mortgages and $123 million for other consumer mortgages. Charlotte, North Carolina-based Wachovia also set aside $1.5 billion for credit losses, up sevenfold from a year earlier and more than triple the third quarter's $408 million. "It suggests they were light in their estimates of bad credit earlier and are playing catch-up," said Michael Mullaney, who helps invest $10 billion at Fiduciary Trust Co in Boston, which owns the bank's shares. "I hope it doesn't portend even greater losses down the road." Also on Tuesday, Charlotte-based Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ), the second-largest U.S. bank, said fourth-quarter profit fell 95 percent. That decline also stemmed mainly from CDO write-downs and loan losses. GOLDEN WEST DRAGS Chief Risk Officer Don Truslow said capital markets stress is "fueling what is turning out to be an unprecedented decline in the housing market." Truslow also said that "significant weaknesses in the California housing markets" has triggered a jump in bad loans. About 634 homes representing $170 million of Golden West's "pick-a-pay" mortgages, which let homeowners pay less than the interest and principal due, were in foreclosure at year end, up from 562 homes representing $155 million on Sept 30, he said. About three-quarters of the homes were in California, he said. Write-downs led to a $596 million quarterly loss from corporate and investment banking. Profit in consumer and business banking, Wachovia's largest unit, fell 18 percent to $1.24 billion. Profit rose 42 percent in capital management to $350 million and 1 percent in wealth management to $85 million. In October, Wachovia completed its acquisition of St. Louis-based A.G. Edwards Inc for roughly $6.4 billion, creating the second-largest U.S. retail brokerage. Thompson said the bank is on track to lose not more than 3 percent of customers it wants to retain, a typical attrition rate. Lending income rose 1 percent to $4.67 billion, although net interest margin fell to 2.88 percent from 3.09 percent a year earlier, and from 2.92 percent in the third quarter. Fee income and other income fell 37 percent to $2.53 billion. Wachovia ended the year with $763.5 billion of assets. Through Friday, Wachovia shares had fallen 45 percent in the last year, compared with a 34 percent drop in the 24-member Philadelphia KBW Bank Index .BKX. In the last three months, the shares had fallen by one-third. "It's hard for me to understand the impact that out stock price has taken over the last three months," Thompson said. "I look at how we compare to others and I feel very good about where Wachovia is." (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel; Editing by Derek Caney/Andre Grenon)
