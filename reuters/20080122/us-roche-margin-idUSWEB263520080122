 ZURICH  (Reuters) - Roche Holding AG ( ROG.VX ) sees little impact on group margins on earnings per share from its $3.4 billion acquisition diagnostics maker Ventana Medical Systems Inc VMSI.O. 

 "(We) expect the operating margin in Ventana will be accreted to the margin for the diagnostics division ... there is certainly room to improve this margin," Severin Schwan, head of the diagnostics division, told journalists. "In terms of the group overall, it has a minimal impact on the margin and also on the EPS," he said. Schwan also said the group would continue to look for further acquisitions in diagnostics. "Roche will continue to screen the market and look out for the right opportunities, but it will always be very targeted," Schwan said. (Reporting by  Douwe Miedema  and  Sam Cage )
