 PARIS  (Reuters) - The equity sell-off of recent days is not comparable to the market collapses of 2001 and 1987, a top official at the NYSE-Euronext exchange operator said on Tuesday. 

 "It is fundamentally a credit crisis and the share markets are reacting to its consequences. It is not a stock market crisis such as we saw in 2001 and 1987," deputy CEO Jean-Francois Theodore said at the launch of a new product. (Reporting by Wiliam Emmanuel)
