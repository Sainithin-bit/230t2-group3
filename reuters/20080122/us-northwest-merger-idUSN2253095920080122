 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The flight attendants at Northwest Airlines Corp are willing to back a merger, but they want higher wages first. 

 "We would like to be supportive (of) a merger, but we must first ensure that our members' needs are addressed," Kevin Griffin, president of the Association of Flight Attendants union at Northwest, said in a statement. Northwest flight attendants are looking to reclaim concessions ordered by a bankruptcy court while the carrier was in Chapter 11. The union said those concessions led to a 40 percent reduction in wages and benefits. Northwest is reportedly in merger talks with Delta Air Lines Inc. The airlines have declined to comment.
