 BOSTON  (Reuters) - United Airlines said on Wednesday it would immediately comply with an order from U.S. regulators grounding Boeing Co's 787 Dreamliner pending safety checks of the plane's batteries. 
 United, which had some 787 flights in-air when the order came down, said it would put currently scheduled passengers for future flights on other aircraft. (Reporting By  Ben Berkowitz ; Editing by  Gary Hill )
