 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve ordered Goldman Sachs to hire an outside consultant to review mortgage loans serviced by a subsidiary in order to identify and compensate borrowers who were wrongly foreclosed upon, the central bank announced on Thursday. 

 The Fed said it believes a monetary penalty will be needed and plans to announce one at a future date. The subsidiary, Litton Loan Servicing LP, is being sold by Goldman to Ocwen Financial Corp. (Reporting by  Dave Clarke ; Editing by Phil Berlowitz)
