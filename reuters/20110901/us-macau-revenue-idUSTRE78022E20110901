 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Macau, the world's largest gambling destination, posted a 57 percent year-on-year rise in gaming revenue for August to $24.77 billion patacas ($3.08 billion) on Thursday, the latest indication that the enclave is powering ahead despite deep-seated concerns about the global economy. 

 The former Portuguese colony has reported booming revenue growth since the start of the year, boosted by an increasing number of cash-rich gamblers from mainland China eager to visit in the country's only legal casino market. Home to multi-billion dollar casinos including U.S. gaming stalwarts Sands China Ltd ( 1928.HK ), Wynn Macau Ltd ( 1128.HK ), and MGM China Holdings Ltd ( 2282.HK ), Macau is on track to post full-year revenue five times higher than rival Las Vegas.
