 VENICE, Italy  (Reuters) - The European Central Bank kept its interest rates at a record-low 1.0 percent on Thursday and its head Jean-Claude Trichet is expected to caution against hopes of a speedy economic recovery. 

 The decision met analyst expectations -- all 82 economists in a Reuters poll had expected interest rates to stay on hold in October for the fifth month running, with most expecting them to stay unchanged until late next year. "This was no surprise at all," said Nomura economist Laurent Bilke. "The ECB has signaled there wouldn't be any additional monetary policy stimulus but that they are not ready for a rate hike yet." Financial markets were largely unchanged after the decision. The Governing Council's Venice meeting was the second of two held annually outside its Frankfurt base and marks the first anniversary of coordinated rate cuts by major central banks in the aftermath of the Lehman Brothers collapse. The Reserve Bank of Australia on Tuesday became the first Group of 20 central bank to raise rates after the recession hit. While most analysts expect the next ECB rate move to be a hike, they forecast that it will not happen before the third quarter of next year. But tighter liquidity conditions may push up market rates before that, futures pricing shows. The Bank of England also kept its rates on hold on Thursday, as was widely expected. Attention now turns to Trichet's news conference, where he is seen confirming that current policy settings are appropriate. Markets will listen for any clues on the timing and order of the ECB's exit strategy. "Current rates are appropriate, that is a key sentence that will probably stay until well into next year," Bank of America economist Holger Schmieding said. The ECB is unlikely to detail its exit strategy, just to repeat that it can exit when needed, he added. Trichet's comments on how governments should wind back their extra spending and how the ECB will take fiscal exit into account in its monetary policy decisions will also be key. "They will definitely not do any explicit coordination (between fiscal and monetary exit strategies)," Schmieding said, but added: "There might be actually be a case that if fiscal policy is tightened in 2011, the ECB may take that into account and thus have an indirect impact on its rate policy." DOLLAR WEAKNESS Trichet's comments on economic recovery will also face close scrutiny. The euro zone economy shrank by a revised 0.2 percent in the second quarter of the year, and analysts expect it to have grown 0.3 percent in the July-September quarter. ECB policymakers have said the road ahead would be bumpy and Trichet is unlikely to change his tune just a month after the latest set of ECB staff economic projections. He said a month ago the ECB sees a very gradual recovery. "The ECB has been very cautious and its forecast is well below consensus forecast for 2010 economic activity," Bilke said, but added the ECB is likely to keep the previous assessment or, at most, make minor changes to its wording. Analysts are also looking forward to hearing the ECB's views on foreign exchange rates, after European policymakers expressed concern about the strong euro. The euro has gained roughly 3 percent against the dollar since the ECB's September rate meeting and about 16 percent in the last seven months. The Group of Seven countries at meetings in Istanbul stuck to their earlier statement warning against excessive volatility but Trichet said in an interview with Reuters Television on Tuesday that rebalancing the global economy did not mean the dollar should depreciate against the euro. "I don't think he will be more specific and go beyond that," Bank of America's Schmieding said. BANKING SUPPORT Markets also expect to hear the ECB's view of last week's 12-month tender, which saw demand fall to just 75 billion euros from 442 billion in June, reducing the amount of extra liquidity in money markets. "The amounts borrowed by banks could be interpreted as signaling that there is only little funding pressure in the banking system at the moment," Nomura's Bilke said. It is most likely too early for the ECB to reveal details of the next 12-month tender in December, Bilke said. Thursday's meeting is also the last one before the ECB publishes its third-quarter bank lending survey, and Trichet might give some preliminary details of the study. Some small and medium-sized companies have said access to loans is hampered, and politicians have warned of a credit crunch forming, but ECB policymakers have stressed the demand side in explaining slow credit growth.
