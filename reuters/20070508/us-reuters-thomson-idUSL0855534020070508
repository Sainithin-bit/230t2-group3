 LONDON  (Reuters) - Canadian publisher Thomson Corp. TOC.TO TOC.Nis in talks to buy Reuters Group Plc RTR.L RTRSY.O for about 8.6 billion pounds ($17 billion) to create the world's biggest financial news and data company, the two companies said on Tuesday. 

 Under the terms of the proposed deal, Reuters Chief Executive Tom Glocer would become chief executive of a dual-listed group to be called Thomson-Reuters, the companies said in a joint statement. The Thomson family, which owns 70 percent of the Toronto-based group, would own 53 percent of the combined company. Reuters investors would get 352-1/2 pence in cash and 0.16 of one Thomson share for reach Reuters share, together worth 686 pence a share at Monday's closing prices. That would be 28 percent above Reuters close on Thursday, the day before news of the talks emerged. The deal value is based on the number of outstanding Reuters shares. Reuters second-largest shareholder, ValueAct, said the price seemed fair, and it was happy with the mix of cash and shares. Shares in Thomson closed down 1.46 Canadian dollars at 45.77, giving it a market value of about C$29.5 billion Canadian dollars ($27 billion). Reuters shares, which rose to a five-year high of 659 pence in early trade, closed at 630 pence, well below the proposed bid, partly reflecting the decline in Thomson shares but also reflecting concerns that a deal could take a long time and face questions from competition regulators. "We would expect close U.S. and EC (European Commission) regulatory scrutiny," Credit Suisse analysts said in a note. The spread on the deal -- meaning the percentage difference between the value of Thomson's offer and Reuters current share price -- was 8.84 percent. Some arbitrage traders said the spread was slightly higher than could be typically expected, reflecting risks that a deal would not close or would be held up by anti-trust issues. Thomson, whose publishing interests span law, tax and scientific research, has been building its financial data business as it looks to tap into booming global markets. Currently third with 11 percent of the world's $12.5 billion market data business, Thomson would jump to 34 percent with Reuters, putting it just ahead of privately-owned Bloomberg with 33 percent, according to Inside Market Data. A deal would add Reuters strength in sales and trading to Thomson's base with money managers and investment bankers. The talks come amid a frenzy of dealmaking in the media sector. Last week Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. NWSa.N made a $5 billion bid for Wall Street Journal owner Dow Jones & Co Inc. DJ.N. The offer was rebuffed by Dow Jones' controlling investors. Thomson and Reuters said they expected to make over $500 million of annual synergies within three years of completion of a deal, which could come this or next year. "Although a rival bid cannot be ruled out, given the scale of synergies on offer (and therefore healthy premium offered) ... we view Thomson as the bidder best placed to secure Reuters," Numis Securities analysts wrote in a research note. THOMSON-REUTERS The combined Thomson Financial unit and Reuters financial and media businesses would be called Reuters, and adopt the Reuters trust principles aimed at protecting the independence of its news operation, the companies said. The Reuters Founders Share Co, run by 15 trustees, has a "golden share" and could block a takeover. "It should be emphasized that discussions are at a stage where there can be no assurance that agreement will be reached. No transaction will be announced without the support of the Reuters Founders Share Company," the companies said. The Thomson family bought its first newspaper in 1934 and built a publishing empire which, for a time, included the Times newspaper and Scottish Television. It branched into other fields, including creating a travel business that still bears its name, before focusing more recently on electronic publishing. It is in talks to sell its education unit, which analysts said could raise about $5 billion. Reuters was founded by German-born immigrant Paul Julius Reuter in 1851 when he opened an office to transmit stock market quotes between London and Paris via the new Calais-Dover cable. The Thomson family, through its Woodbridge vehicle, would vote in favour of a deal with Reuters, the companies said. Other Thomson shareholders would own 23 percent of the combined business and Reuters shareholders would own 24 percent. The deal is subject to approval by both sets of shareholders. Under the proposed deal, a so-called equalization agreement would mean that both companies' primary listings would be maintained. This should allow the two companies to remain in their existing equity indexes, the companies said. Thomson President and CEO Richard Harrington would retire on completion of the deal, at which point Reuters' Glocer would become chief executive of the combined company. Thomson's lead advisers are Bear Stearns BSC.N and Perella Weinberg Partners. UBS ( UBSN.VX ) is advising Reuters.
