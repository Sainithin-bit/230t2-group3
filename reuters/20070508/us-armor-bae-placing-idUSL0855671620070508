 LONDON  (Reuters) - British defense contractor BAE Systems Plc BA.L said on Tuesday it had raised 750 million pounds ($1.5 billion) in a share placing to help fund its acquisition of U.S. Armor Holdings Inc ( AH.N ). 

 BAE announced on Monday its plan to expand its share of the lucrative U.S. military market with a $4.1 billion deal to buy the U.S. body amour and army truck maker for $88 per share. BAE said around 174 million new shares, which represents about 5.5 percent of its issued ordinary share capital prior to the placing, were placed at a price of 430 pence each. Europe's largest defense contractor -- which makes Typhoon jet fighters, Nimrod reconnaissance planes and nuclear-powered submarines -- is building up its military business after selling its stake in plane maker Airbus ( EAD.PA ) last year. BAE already makes about 40 percent of its annual sales of almost 14 billion pounds in the United States. It ranks as eighth biggest Pentagon contractor, taking the lead role on $4.7 billion of awards last year and also undertakes major sub-contract work for other firms like Lockheed Martin Corp. ( LMT.N ) and Northrop Grumman Corp. ( NOC.N ). BAE shares were down 3 percent at 432-3/4 pence by 1500 GMT, valuing the group at around 13.8 billion pounds.
