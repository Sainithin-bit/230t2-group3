 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said on Monday it switched to using trans-fat-free oil for frying foods, including chicken, corn dogs and country steak at its in-store delis. 

 The switch to the healthier oil affects more than 2,400 delicatessen locations within Wal-Mart's Supercenter and Neighborhood Markets in the United States. While food selections vary from store to store, anything fried on-site at the delis will use the trans-fat-free oil, the company said. The switch started in January and is now complete, Wal-Mart said. Wal-Mart's announcement follows similar moves by restaurant companies, including Wendy's International Inc., Yum Brands Inc.'s KFC and Taco Bell chains and Starbucks Corp.. Trans fat increases the low-density lipoprotein -- so-called "bad cholesterol" -- in food and U.S. health officials have advised the American public to consume as little trans fat as possible. New York City has banned trans fats from restaurants and other states are experimenting with similar regulations to force restaurants to stop frying foods in oils that increase the risk of heart disease and stroke.
