 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Medical device maker Boston Scientific Corp. ( BSX.N ) may seek to sell some parts of the company to help pay down its roughly $7.2 billion in net debt, company officials told shareholders on Tuesday. 

 "There are some pieces of Boston Scientific we've acquired or inherited over the years that are no longer strategic," said Lawrence Best, executive vice president and chief financial officer. "It's better to simplify our business and basically liquidate our positions, or divest from those businesses," said Best, who is due to retire from his position in July. "This is a good thing. This will help fund some of the debt repayment. It also simplifies the business and allows management to focus on the sweet spots." Best did not offer details of what pieces of the company's portfolio it might consider selling. The company, best known for drug-coated stents used to treat clogged heart arteries, racked up much of its debt as a result of its $27 billion April 2006 takeover of rival Guidant. That deal has drawn some investor criticism as costs weighed on earnings. In March, the company said its net debt stood at $7.2 billion. Boston Scientific is also considering an IPO of its endosurgery unit. "Why the endosurgery IPO?" Best said. "The endosurgery group is the most predictable, most diverse part of our business. It's grown forever, it's predictable and that's why Wall Street would love it. Again, we have not decided to do this, we're exploring it." PLANT CLEANUP PROGRESS James Tobin, president and chief executive officer, noted that the company has completed most of the work it needed to do to resolve deficiencies at a plant that manufactures heart- rhythm devices. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration in December 2005 had issued a letter warning of problems at the company's St. Paul, Minnesota plant. Tobin said Boston Scientific is now ready for a third-party audit of the facility. The next step after that would be FDA evaluation. Resolution of this issue would allow the company to win U.S. approvals for new heart-rhythm products, such as pacemakers and defibrillators. "We've done 95 percent of the work that we need to do in order to put ourselves not just at compliance, but to set a new standard for what can be done in this area," Tobin said. Boston Scientific shares trade at about 18.7 times forecast 2007 earnings, roughly in line with the forward price-to- earnings ratio of the Standard & Poor's Health Care Equipment & Services Industry Group Index. .GSPHC They have declined about 3.5 percent so far this year, while their group has risen about 10.4 percent. In Tuesday afternoon trading, they were down 10 cents at $16.57 on the New York Stock Exchange. Boston Scientific last week named Sam Leno, formerly of orthopedic device maker Zimmer Holdings Inc. ( ZMH.N ) to succeed Best as chief financial officer.
