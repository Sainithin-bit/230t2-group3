 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard Co. ( HPQ.N ) raised its forecast for second-quarter revenue and earnings ahead of Wall Street targets on Tuesday, citing strength in its personal computer and server businesses and sending shares up as much as 2.7 percent. 

 The world's biggest maker of personal computers and printers said it now expects to post revenue of $25.50 billion to $25.55 billion in the second quarter, which is about $1 billion more than it had previously forecast and well ahead of revenue in the period a year ago. HP forecast adjusted earnings of 69 to 70 cents per share for the second quarter -- up from its previous estimate of 63 to 64 cents. Analysts were looking for earnings excluding items of 65 cents a share on revenue of $24.6 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. It also raised its forecast for net earnings per share to 64 to 65 cents from its previous estimate of 57 to 58 cents. The per share figures will be helped by buybacks that reduced the amount of outstanding stock. HP also set third-quarter targets ahead of Wall Street's. "Demand for HP products remains robust despite concerns about the economy," said Brent Bracelin, an analyst with Pacific Crest Securities. "To put up that type of revenue number, they have to have gotten a healthy contribution from their PC business, which is a third of their revenue," he said. "It's definitely a pleasant surprise, especially in light of less robust comments from other companies including EMC (Corp. ( EMC.N )), Seagate (Technology STX.N), Sun (Microsystems Inc. SUNW.O) and IBM (International Business Machines Corp. ( IBM.N )) regarding U.S. enterprise spending," said American Technology analyst Shaw Wu. He said that HP also benefited in the quarter from lower prices on hard disk drives, flat panel displays and microprocessors. "We believe HP's upside surprise is more likely the result of share gains as opposed to a stronger market," Wu said. Shares of the company were up 95 cents or 2.2 percent to $44.75 after the updated forecast, which HP issued after inadvertently releasing some financial data. The stock had hit a fresh 12-month high of $44.97 earlier in the session. HP has been taking market share from longtime rival Dell Inc. DELL.O, which has stumbled in recent quarters. HP's PC business, includes desktop PCs, workstations and notebook computers. Dell lost market share to HP in the fourth quarter and in January, when founder Michael Dell replaced Kevin Rollins as chief executive officer following a string of disappointing earnings reports, slowing growth and complaints about printers. By contrast, HP's chief rival IBM last month posted an 8 percent rise in quarterly profit, helped by higher sales of software and computer services. IBM is the world's biggest technology services firm. For the third quarter, HP forecast revenue of about $23.7 billion to $23.9 billion, earnings per share before items in the range of 63 to 65 cents, and EPS on a generally accepted accounting principles basis in the range of 59 to 61 cents. Analysts have been expecting Palo Alto, California-based HP to earn a profit before items of 61 cents a share on revenue of $23.6 billion, on average, according to Reuters Estimates. Shares of Dell rose 1 cent to $25.91 and shares of IBM fell 1 cents to $102.75. EMC shares were up 10 cents at $15.71, Seagate up 29 cents to $22.63 and Sun unchanged at $5.22.
