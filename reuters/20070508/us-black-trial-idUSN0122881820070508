 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - The man who was Conrad Black's trusted business partner for 30 years testified on Tuesday how the two men diverted millions of dollars to themselves. 

 David Radler, who has pleaded guilty to a single count of fraud and faces 29 months in prison, provided details in the former media baron's fraud trial of a $472 million sale of U.S. newspapers in 1998. Radler said the sale included $50 million in non-compete fees, part of which was siphoned off by Black and other defendants in the case. "Mr. Black told me that Inc. deserved some of the non-compete monies that were being allocated," Radler testified, referring to Hollinger Inc., Black's closely-controlled Toronto-based holding company. Hollinger Inc. was the largest shareholder in Chicago-based media giant Hollinger International Inc., which was led by Black with Radler as his deputy. "He said Inc. was the parent and, as the parent, it deserved a portion of the $50 million fee. He said it was deserving," Radler said. "I listened. I certainly didn't say no," he added. Radler said it was later determined that the Canadian company would get $12 million, or roughly one fourth of the fee. Black and three co-defendants are accused of using the non-compete payments to give themselves tax-free bonuses. Such payments were set aside from the proceeds after sale prices were determined, and were designed to give the buyer a guarantee that the seller would not reenter the same market. Prosecutors say Hollinger International should have received all the proceeds and was cheated out of $60 million. The 25 percent allocation of non-compete payments to Hollinger Inc. in the 1998 sale became the "template" for future transactions, Radler said, and the executives also inserted themselves into non-compete arrangements to receive payments individually. Black is charged with racketeering, fraud, money laundering and obstruction of justice and faces up to 101 years in prison and millions in fines and restitution. Radler recalled being told by former top company executive Peter Atkinson, a defendant, that Radler had to sign a non-compete agreement as part of the $3 billion sale of Hollinger International's Canadian newspapers in 2000. "I was kind of stunned," Radler said, because the agreement effectively barred Radler from the industry in Canada. "I told him I did not want to sign one without getting compensation" and asked for C$25 million, ultimately settling for C$19 million. Atkinson and Hollinger Inc.'s former Chief Financial Officer Jack Boultbee, another defendant, were "inserted" into that deal and received C$2 million each, Radler said. A fourth defendant, Hollinger International's former attorney Mark Kipnis, asked for and received a $100,000 bonus. Radler said he and Black agreed that similar non-compete arrangements could reward the executives in a series of newspaper sales that took place from 1999 to 2001. KEPT FROM DIRECTORS Radler said the specifics of the payments to the executives and companies they closely controlled were kept from the directors of Hollinger International Inc. "What if anything did Mr. Black say (to the board) about Inc. receiving 25 percent of the non-compete payments?" prosecutor Eric Sussman asked Radler. "He didn't say anything," Radler replied. "Why didn't you say anything to the board about this?" Sussman asked. "I should have said something but I didn't. I regret that," Radler replied. Sussman often had to reword questions because Radler's rambling answers triggered objections from defense lawyers. At one point, Sussman asked Radler to listen closely to his questions. Radler said he misinformed Hollinger International's board members that the purchasers of the newspapers had requested the non-compete agreements, because telling the truth would have prompted probing questions he did not want to answer. "Because if the buyers didn't want the non-compete, why offer it?" Radler said. Hollinger International, which sold off hundreds of newspapers it once owned in North America as well as London's Daily Telegraph and the Jerusalem Post, later ousted Black and Radler and changed its name to Sun-Times Media Group. It is now a much smaller company with regional holdings here. The 62-year-old Black, a Canadian-born member of Britain's House of Lords, faces up to 101 years in prison, millions in fines and $92 million in forfeitures if convicted. His co-defendants face lesser charges. Radler first took the stand on Monday in the trial's eighth week as the U.S. government's star witness. On Tuesday, he shot an occasional glance at his former business partner during breaks in his testimony. The case in federal court is being prosecuted by the office of U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald, who recently won a perjury conviction against former top White House aide Lewis "Scooter" Libby. The Tuesday session was ended around midday to allow defense lawyers time to review boxes of documents from Black's Toronto offices that prosecutors said they recently obtained. Black lost a legal effort in Canada to keep them from being released. (With writing by Mike Conlon in Chicago)
