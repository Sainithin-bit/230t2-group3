 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - J. Pedro Reinhard, who was fired by Dow Chemical Co. ( DOW.N ) last month after being accused of holding unauthorized talks to sell the company, on Tuesday sued Dow for libel and breach of contract. 

 The complaint filed by the board member and former chief financial officer seeks both compensatory and punitive damages for libel, and compensatory damages for breach of contract, amounting to $75 million. The complaint was filed in the United States District Court, Southern District of New York, against Dow and Andrew Liveris, the company's chairman and chief executive. Last month, Dow fired Reinhard and Romeo Kreinberg, head of its performance plastics operations, accusing them of engaging in a "business activity that was highly inappropriate." Chris Huntley, a Dow spokesman, said the company had on Tuesday morning filed suit against both Reinhard and Kreinberg. "This is clearly a response to what we (Dow) did this morning," said Huntley, adding that Dow has not yet seen Reinhard's complaint and could not comment on it immediately. Midland, Michigan-based Dow had earlier this year been the subject of numerous leveraged buyout rumors. Reinhard was Dow's chief financial officer for 10 years before stepping down from that post in late 2005. He is currently on the boards of Colgate-Palmolive Co. ( CL.N ) and Royal Bank of Canada ( RY.TO ) ( RY.N ). Reinhard is also still a member of Dow's board of directors, as only shareholders can remove a board member. However, Dow has dropped Reinhard from its slate of nominees for election to its board, which is due to be held at the company's annual meeting this Thursday. Reinhard has categorically denied Dow's allegations. "I have demonstrated the highest standards of ethics and integrity, and have acted in accordance with my fiduciary responsibilities," Reinhard said in a statement on Tuesday. "I have and will continue to categorically deny that I have been part of any secret effort to take over or acquire Dow Chemical," Reinhard added. Kreinberg has denied the allegations and said no proof of anything was offered to him. "I can't imagine where this has come from. I've been 30 years with the company and I'm extremely surprised about everything that has happened," Kreinberg said in a phone interview with Reuters last month.
