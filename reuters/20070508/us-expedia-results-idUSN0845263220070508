 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Online travel agency Expedia Inc. ( EXPE.O ) said on Tuesday quarterly net profit grew, but shares fell more than 8 percent as adjusted income fell short of expectations. 

 The No. 1 online travel agency said first-quarter net earnings rose to $34.8 million, or 11 cents per share, from $23.3 million, or 6 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, Expedia earned 18 cents per share. On that basis, analysts' average forecast was 20 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Shares, which rose 10.5 percent in the first quarter, were down 6.69 percent at $23.15 on Nasdaq in early trade. "It's just that expenses were higher than expected, and they missed consensus on the bottom line," said Marianne Wolk, an analyst at Susquehanna. The company's operating expenses were mostly higher, with the biggest increase in selling and marketing costs, which jumped 10.6 percent. The company reporting total bookings of $5.02 billion, up 8 percent from the first quarter of 2006. European bookings grew 32 percent. Expedia and rivals such as Priceline.com Inc. ( PCLN.O ) have been making inroads into European markets, where online travel bookings lag behind the United States. The companies also have set their sites on budding Asian markets. "With accelerating transaction growth, a 32 percent increase in European bookings, 11 percent revenue growth and the very beginning echoes of resurgence at Expedia.com we are seeing the early results of the reinvestments and reorganizations that made last year so challenging," said Expedia Chairman Barry Diller.
