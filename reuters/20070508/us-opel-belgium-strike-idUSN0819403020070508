 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Workers at General Motors' Opel ( GM.N ) plant will vote on Thursday whether to accept an offer to end their strike, a union official said on Tuesday. 

 "People will express their votes on Thursday morning and we'll see what the results will be," said Walter Cnop, president of Belgium's Christian ACV-CSC union. He said a meeting with striking workers on Tuesday evening had been informational, but did not mean an end to the strike. Two more informational meetings were set for Wednesday morning and afternoon for workers on other shifts, he said. Earlier, another union official indicated the strike might end as soon as Tuesday. Workers walked out in protest against a decision by GM not to build the next-generation Astra model in Belgium, as well as plans to cut 1,400 jobs in the plant in Antwerp, about a third of the work force, this year. But on Tuesday, GM Europe offered a deal that may secure enough production to make the plant viable. GM Europe said it planned to produce two models of a new generation vehicle for the European market, with annual production of 120,000 vehicles. It said it would also look at opportunities for additional models, "assuming the ongoing competitiveness of the plant." The Astra is GM's top model in Europe with nearly half a million sold last year. GM's decision not to produce the new Astra in Belgium was another blow to the country's auto industry after Volkswagen AG ( VOWG.DE ) said last year it would cut its work force in Brussels to 1,500 from over 5,000. Europe's largest carmaker eventually offered the plant the prospect of building the new Audi A1, securing 2,200 jobs, but only after workers had accepted longer hours for the same pay.
