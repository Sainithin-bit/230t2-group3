 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Maintenance problems with aging oil refineries and strong global gasoline demand should push gasoline prices for American motorists slightly above $3.00 per gallon this summer, the U.S. Energy Information Administration projected on Tuesday. 

 During the U.S. summer driving season, the average monthly gasoline pump price is projected to peak at $3.01 per gallon in May and again in August, as gasoline inventories remain low and the hurricane season approaches, the statistical agency said in its latest monthly outlook. Retail prices are projected to average $2.95 per gallon over this summer up from $2.84 last summer, EIA said. EIA's estimates for the average summer gasoline price are 14 cents per gallon higher than what the agency predicted in April. "Gasoline inventories are expected to remain below the lower end of the normal range throughout the summer, which will keep pressure on gasoline prices and likely result in higher margins and retail prices than those seen last summer," EIA said. Gasoline inventories, which typically build slightly in April, sharply declined last month because of the high incidence of refinery outages and low imports, the agency said. Total motor gasoline inventories at the end of April are estimated to be 193 million barrels, over 14 million barrels less than last April.
