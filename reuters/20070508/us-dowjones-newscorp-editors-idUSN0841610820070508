 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Some Wall Street Journal editors knew that News Corp. NWSa.N was making a $5 billion bid for the paper's parent, Dow Jones & Co. DJ.N, at least a week before the news broke elsewhere, but they did not publish it, the New York Times reported on Tuesday. 

 The Times said that while no one has suggested that anyone at Dow Jones traded on the information, questions of who knew about the offer ahead of a formal announcement could become an issue for securities regulators looking into unusual trading in options to buy Dow Jones stock in advance of the news. Several days after Murdoch submitted a letter to the Dow Jones board, he sent an e-mail message to the Journal's top editor, Paul Steiger, marked "Personal and Confidential," telling him of the bid, the Times reported citing unidentified sources at Dow Jones. Murdoch offered his reassurances that he would uphold the editorial integrity of the Journal if he were successful, according to the Times. The Times, citing people within Dow Jones, reported that Steiger felt bound by the "confidential" nature of his communications with Murdoch, and it weighed heavily on his decision not to publish a story. Several other editors were also aware of the offer, the paper said. A Dow Jones representative could not immediately be reached for comment.
