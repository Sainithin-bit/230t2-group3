 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Independent power producer Dynegy Inc. ( DYN.N ) said on Tuesday it posted a quarterly profit against a year-earlier loss, citing higher power prices in its northeast region and stronger weather-driven demand. 

 Net income was $14 million, or 3 cents per share, compared with an year-earlier loss of $4 million, or 1 cent per share. Shares of the Houston-based company, whose power plants produce a total of nearly 20,000 megawatts of electricity, have risen about 40 percent this year, compared with a rise of 15 percent in the Standard & Poor's utility index .GSPU. Increased power demand has helped push the utility index to near its lifetime high as the sector continues rebounding from the 2001-2002 industry meltdown that resulted from Enron Corp.'s bankruptcy and the California energy crisis.
