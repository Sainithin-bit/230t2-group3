 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Drugstore and pharmacy benefits company CVS/Caremark Corp. ( CVS.N ) posted a 24 percent rise in first-quarter profit on Tuesday, aided by new stores and strong sales of prescription drugs. 

 The results include 10 days of operations at Caremark, the pharmacy benefits manager that CVS acquired on March 22. Chief Financial Officer David Rickard said during a conference call that CVS and Caremark are both doing well and showing strong sales growth, and the shares rose 3 percent. First-quarter profit was $408.9 million, or 43 cents per share, compared with $329.6 million, or 39 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items related to the acquisition, CVS/Caremark earned 46 cents per share, in line with Wall Street expectations. "The quarter was clearly messy, given the partial impact of Caremark; however, we believe that individual performance at both businesses was fairly strong," Raymond James analyst John Ransom said in a research note. CVS issued the results the day before its annual meeting. Several groups oppose two board nominees who were on Caremark's board before the $24 billion acquisition, in part because they believe the pair were part of a flawed negotiation process. GENERICS First-quarter revenue jumped 32.1 percent to $13.18 billion, aided by the June acquisition of Albertsons' Osco and Sav-on drugstore chains. As previously reported, sales at stores open more than one year, a key measure of retail strength known as same-store sales, rose 7.5 percent. CVS, based in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, said April same-store sales rose 6.1 percent, with pharmacy same-store sales up 7 percent and same-store sales of general merchandise up 3.9 percent. Total revenue for the four weeks ended April 28 jumped 21.4 percent to $3.7 billion, excluding Caremark. Bank of America equity analyst Scott Mushkin said the April results missed his forecast for a 7 percent rise in same-store sales and a 7.5 percent rise in pharmacy same-store sales. CVS said pharmacy same-store sales were pressured by about 5.8 percentage points due to recent generic introductions. While sales took a hit, the use of generics should support gross profit in the second quarter, Mushkin said in a note. While generic medicines are cheaper, they are more profitable for pharmacies since the prices of branded drugs are tightly controlled by the major drug companies that make them. Pharmacy benefit managers such as Caremark administer prescription drug benefits for employers and health plans. They also benefit from greater use of generics since they can buy them in bulk from manufacturers to leverage discounts. The percentage of Caremark's prescriptions filled with generics increased 4.5 percentage points in the first quarter to a record 58.2 percent. Mail and retail revenue both increased. By comparison, rival Express Scripts Inc. ( ESRX.O ), which failed in its bid to buy Caremark, said in April that its use of generics reached 60.3 percent in the first quarter, up from 56.3 percent a year earlier. OUTLOOK Chief Financial Officer Rickard said the board is likely to discuss share repurchases on Wednesday, and he included the assumption of buybacks in a new outlook he gave on Tuesday. CVS had previously forecast full-year earnings of $1.87 to $1.93 per share. It now expects $1.86 to $1.91 per share, including a hit of about 7 cents from the Caremark deal and a few cents due to the delayed timing of repurchases. Rickard forecast second-quarter earnings of 44 cents to 47 cents per share. Analysts, on average, expect CVS to earn 45 cents per share in the second quarter and $1.86 per share this year, according to Reuters Estimates. Rickard stood by a prior forecast for Caremark to add 8 cents to 10 cents to earnings per share in 2008, and 14 cents to 18 cents to earnings per share in 2009. Shares of CVS/Caremark were up 73 cents, or 2 percent, at $36.85 in late-morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares trade at about 15.8 times estimated 2008 earnings, while rival drugstore chain Walgreen Co. ( WAG.N ) trades at a multiple of 19.1, according to Reuters data. As of April 28, CVS had 6,210 stores. The company also operates 52 specialty pharmacies.
