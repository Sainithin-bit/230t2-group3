 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. economy will grow in 2007, with the rate of growth in manufacturing outpacing that of the non-manufacturing sector, purchasing and supply management executives said on Tuesday. 

 Manufacturing revenue is seen growing 5.6 percent in 2007 while capital spending in the sector was expected to rise 5.8 percent, said the Institute for Supply Management in a semiannual forecast. Capacity utilization in manufacturing was estimated at 82.8 percent, the ISM's Business Survey Committee forecast said. "While 2007 appears to be lagging behind the last three years, in terms of manufacturing growth, the forecast indicates that manufacturers are investing and foresee revenue improvement in the future," said Norbert Ore, chair of the ISM manufacturing business survey committee. U.S. non-manufacturing revenue was expected to grow 2.1 percent in 2007, according to the ISM survey. U.S. non-manufacturing capital spending was forecast to be up 5.6 percent in 2007, while capacity utilization in non-manufacturing was seen at 84.8 percent. While the rate of growth for non-manufacturing looked lower than the rate of growth for manufacturing, Anthony Nieves, chair of the ISM non-manufacturing business survey committee, said the non-manufacturing sector has maintained a very good rate of growth over the last year. "You have to look at where your baseline is," Nieves said. "We're measuring rates of change and you have to be cognizant that non-manufacturing has gone through 49 months of growth without a contraction." Ore reported that respondents to the manufacturing survey reported an increased ability to raise prices. "We expect manufacturers to have significant pricing power for the rest of the year," Ore said. Based on the survey results and the U.S. government's report that U.S. gross domestic product rose just 1.3 percent in the first quarter, "we probably have expectations of somewhat higher growth for each of the remaining three quarters," Ore said.
