 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Lazard Ltd. ( LAZ.N ) posted weaker-than-expected quarterly earnings on Tuesday amid higher costs and little growth in merger and acquisition fees, sending shares of the financial advisory firm down. 

 First-quarter net income rose to $55.0 million from $52.5 million a year earlier. Earnings per share, assuming the full exchange of all ownership interests, fell to 47 cents from 51 cents, reflecting an increase in shares outstanding. The earnings fell short of analysts' average forecast of 62 cents a share, as calculated by Reuters Estimates. Lazard shares fell nearly 4 percent before paring losses. They were down 80 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $53.10 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. "We expect the stock to respond negatively to this morning's (earnings-per-share) miss, which we would take as an excellent opportunity to buy a premier global M&A franchise with still solid (earnings-per-share) visibility in '07," Bank of America analyst Michael Hecht wrote in a research note. For years, New York-based Lazard's booming M&A business picked up the slack for a laggard money-management arm undergoing a turnaround, but those roles were reversed in the first quarter. Operating revenue rose 11 percent to a record $388.2 million, driven primarily by 23 percent growth in asset-management revenue. Assets under management rose 13 percent from the end of December, to $124.9 billion, a new record, fueled by a net increase of $11.6 billion in new customer funds. But in a period of rampant takeover activity worldwide, Lazard's M&A business eked out just a 1 percent gain in fees to $196.1 million, though that was a record for the first quarter. Lazard Vice Chairman Steve Golub said the flat results reflected the timing of completed deals, which is when advisers are paid. "It's relative to completions," Golub said in an interview. "This year it seems as though our backlog is weighted toward the second half." BofA's Hecht said merger and restructuring revenue came in below his forecasts, and costs were higher. Compensation and benefits costs rose 10 percent to $220 million in the quarter, although operating revenue gained 11 percent. Non-compensation expenses rose to 18.3 percent of operating revenue, compared to 16.5 percent in the quarter a year ago, reflecting increased recruitment costs, professional fees and other costs, it said. Still, Hecht said Lazard's prospects are bright thanks to a backlog of pending fees and strong momentum in its money-management unit. "The good news is that Lazard's pipeline of deals continues to be solid at a total of $402 billion, with $160 billion expected to close in the second quarter," he said. Lazard Chief Executive Bruce Wasserstein said in a statement that the company will expand its M&A coverage into new markets and "adjacent businesses" through takeovers, investments and new hires. "We are also actively pursuing expansion of our asset-management business through acquisitions, new investment products, including merchant banking investments," and the hiring of individuals and teams, he said. Lazard's restructuring business remains "soft," with revenue falling 29 percent to $9.6 million in the first quarter. Golub blamed the glut of investor cash keeping corporate default rates down around 1 percent, compared with 2 percent to 4 percent historically. Non-compensation expenses surged 22 percent in the quarter, driven by investments in asset management and M&A, though the year-ago period included one-time recoveries.
