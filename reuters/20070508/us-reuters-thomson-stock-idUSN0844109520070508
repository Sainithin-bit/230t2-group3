 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of Thomson Corp. TOC.TO TOC.N fell about 5 percent in early North American trading on Tuesday after the Canadian publisher said it was in talks to acquire Reuters Group Plc RTR.L RTRSY.O for about $17.6 billion (8.8 billion pounds).  

 In the opening minutes of activity on the Toronto Stock Exchange, Thomson shares fell C$2.38 to C$44.85. The stock had closed Monday at C$47.23. Meanwhile, on the New York Stock Exchange, its U.S.-listed shares slid $2.03 to $40.80 after finishing Monday at $42.83. Because roughly half of the transaction will be paid in Thomson shares at a rate of 0.16 of a Thomson share for each Reuters share, each move in Thomson shares affects the prospective deal's value. In London, Reuters shares were up 3 percent at 634.25 pence. Its American Depositary Receipts were down 0.73 percent at $75.94 after ending Monday at $76.50 on Nasdaq. ($1=C$1.104)
