 LONDON  (Reuters) - Canada's Thomson Corp TOC.TO is in talks to buy Reuters Group Plc RTR.L for about 8.8 billion pounds ($17.6 billion) to create the world's biggest news and financial data company, the two firms said on Tuesday. 

 Following are key details of the potential deal. ** Each Reuters share would be entitled to 352.5 pence per share in cash and 0.16 Thomson share. ** The deal would value each Reuters share at 697 pence, based on Monday's closing prices, a 42 percent premium to Reuters closing share price on Thursday which was the day before it announced a bid approach. ** Reuters will pay a 12 pence dividend for 2007, with 5 pence payable as an interim dividend. The total paid would be subject to proportionate adjustment if closing occurred before end-December. If closing occurred next year, a proportionate 2008 dividend will also be paid. ** The firms forecast they would make over $500 million of annual synergies within three years of completion. ** The enlarged, dual-listed group will be called Thomson-Reuters, and the combined Thomson Financial unit and Reuters financial and media businesses will be called Reuters. ** The combined group will also adopt the Reuters trust principles aimed at safeguarding the independence of Reuters news, the joint statement said. The Reuters trustees have a "golden share" capable of blocking a takeover of the company. ** Woodbridge, the Thomson family holding company that will own about 53 percent of the combined company, would vote in favor of the deal. ** Other Thomson shareholders would own 23 percent of the combined business and Reuters shareholders will own 24 percent. ** Reuters Chief Executive Tom Glocer will become chief executive of the combined company.
