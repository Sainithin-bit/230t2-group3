 (Reuters) - The Treasury Department on Monday offered up to $30 billion in new aid to insurer American International Group, the latest in a series of rescues that draw on a $700 billion U.S. financial bailout fund. 

 The fresh aid would come on top of a $40 billion government investment in AIG made in November under the Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program. In its latest report on transactions under the $700 billion financial rescue program released on February 24, the Treasury said it had disbursed $306.15 billion. Much more, however, has been pledged and the Obama administration has held out the possibility it could to go Congress to request a further $750 billion. Following is an outline of funds spent or pledged from the TARP bailout fund so far: -- An unspecified amount pledged to seed a public-private partnership to buy bad assets from banks. -- An unspecified amount pledged to pump capital into banks. In the most recent transactions report, the Treasury said it had purchased $196.36 billion in bank equity. -- $50 billion pledged for mortgage foreclosure mitigation. -- $20 billion investment in Citigroup as part of a package in which the government agreed to share in losses on $301 billion of assets. In addition to the investment, the Treasury agreed to cover up to $5 billion in losses on the portfolio. The $20 billion is in addition to $25 billion disbursed in the initial round of bank capital injections. -- $20 billion investment in Bank of America as part of a package in which the government agreed to share in losses on $118 billion of assets. The $20 billion is in addition to $25 billion disbursed earlier as part of the Treasury's bank capital program. -- $40 billion investment in troubled insurer American International Group made on November 25. In addition, the Treasury said on March 2 that it stood ready to provide up to $30 billion more. -- $24.78 billion has been disbursed to prop up the U.S. auto industry, according to the latest transactions report. -- $100 billion pledged to cover potential losses for a Federal Reserve program aimed at supporting credit card, auto, education and small-business lending.
