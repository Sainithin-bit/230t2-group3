 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - HSBC Holdings has moved up the time of the media briefing for its annual results by 45 minutes to 0800 GMT on Monday, the UK-based lender said in a statement. 

 The company, whose shares were suspended from trading in Hong Kong ahead of the market opening on Monday, is expected by sources to announce a rights issue to raise as much as $18 billion alongside its 2008 results. (Reporting by  Tony Munroe ; Editing by  Ken Wills )
