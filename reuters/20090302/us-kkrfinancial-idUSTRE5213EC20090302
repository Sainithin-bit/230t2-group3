 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - KKR Financial Holdings LLC ( KFN.N ), a debt fund managed by private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co, reported a $1.2 billion quarterly loss on Monday and said it would not pay a dividend for the fourth quarter, and probably not for 2009. 

 The publicly traded fund, which invests in such assets as corporate loans, high-yield corporate bonds and distressed debt securities, had also not paid a third-quarter dividend. KKR Financial, known as KFN, said the figures reflected a provision for loan losses, losses on sales of assets during the quarter, a writedown of corporate loans, losses on derivative transactions and a $454 million impairment charge. "Currently, almost all leverage financial companies are facing real challenges and must adjust and rethink their business models," Chief Executive William Sonneborn said on a conference call. "KFN is no exception. Over the course of the fourth quarter, KFN was materially impacted by the dramatic decline in leverage loan prices." The company said about 84 percent of its investments are in leveraged loans, of which 88 percent are senior secured loans. KFN said on the conference call that a number of companies in which it holds corporate debt are on its "watch-list." This includes names that may be performing well and are not necessarily at risk of a covenant breach, but could have an issue such as a higher refinancing risk, it said. The names cited include real estate company Realogy, casino firms Las Vegas Sands Corp ( LVS.N ) and Harrah's Entertainment, bankrupt oil and chemical company Lyondell Chemical Co, retailer Michaels Stores, chip firm Freescale Semiconductor and retailer Neiman Marcus. KFN said that during the year, three of its corporate loan investments defaulted, including media company Tribune Co ( TRBCQ.PK ), which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy during December. For the quarter, KKR Financial reported a net loss of $1.2 billion, or $7.85 a share, compared with year-earlier net income of $59.9 million, or 52 cents per diluted share. KFN said it believes it had enough liquidity and access to liquidity to meet its financial obligations for at least the next 12 months. Shares of KFN fell 34 percent to 71 cents -- below the key $1 dollar level. KFN in December said it received a listing standards notice from the New York Stock Exchange cautioning that it had fallen below the NYSE's continued listing standard, which requires a minimum average closing price of $1 per share over 30 consecutive trading days. It said in December it had six months to bring its average share price back above $1. On February 26, the NYSE said it was suspending the $1 minimum price requirement for its listed companies until June 30. (Editing by Lisa Von Ahn and Gerald E. McCormick)
