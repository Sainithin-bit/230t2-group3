 (Reuters) - Outdoor advertising company Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings Inc ( CCO.N ) swung to a quarterly loss, hurt by a goodwill impairment charge of $3.2 billion due to the global economic downturn, sending its shares down 32 percent to an all-time low. 

 The company reported a fourth-quarter net loss of $3.01 billion, or $8.53 a share, compared with a profit of $106.6 million, or 30 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue came in at $785.5 million. Excluding the goodwill impairment and certain other charges, the company posted a loss of 2 cents a share. Analysts expected earnings of 11 cents a share, excluding exceptional items, on revenue of $867.1 million, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue from the America's region fell about $54.8 million for 2008, with the entire decline occurring in the fourth quarter, as poster and bulletin revenue dropped due to cancellations and non-renewals from major national advertisers. "Our Outdoor business has been hit by the deterioration in the global business environment and specifically the advertising downturn," Chief Executive Mark Mays said in a statement. As the United States sinks deeper into a recession, businesses are pulling back on advertising budgets to cut down on expenses. Shares of the San Antonio, Texas-based company fell $1.05 to a low of $2.20 before paring some losses to trade down 64 cents at $2.61 Monday morning on the New York Stock Exchange.
