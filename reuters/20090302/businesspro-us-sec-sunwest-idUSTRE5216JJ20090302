 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. regulators charged Sunwest Management with securities fraud alleging the retirement home operator lied to investors about its operations and investments, the Securities and Exchange Commission said on Monday. 

 The SEC alleged Oregon-based Sunwest, which operates more than 200 retirement homes in the United States, concealed the risks of investments and exposed investors to "massive losses when the economic downturn triggered Sunwest's collapse." Sunwest raised at least $300 million from some 1,300 investors by promising a steady income stream and promoting its success in running the properties, the SEC alleged. The SEC said it was seeking an emergency court order to freeze Sunwest's assets. (Reporting by  Rachelle Younglai ; Editing by  Andre Grenon )
