 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Trading in shares of HSBC Holdings plc was suspended in Hong Kong on Monday, the Hong Kong stock exchange said, ahead of what sources have said will be a rights issue of up to $18 billion to be announced later on Monday alongside its 2008 results. 

 The statement said HSBC's shares were suspended pending the announcement of a corporate action to be made about the same time HSBC releases its annual results.
