 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending rebounded in January, snapping six months of declines, and incomes rose unexpectedly, boosted by salary increases for government employees, a government report showed on Monday. 

 KEY POINTS: * The Commerce Department said spending rose by 0.6 percent, the largest increase since May, after falling by an unrevised 1 percent in December. * Incomes advanced by 0.4 percent, also posting the biggest increase since May, after December's 0.2 percent decrease. * The department attributed to rise in income to pay rises for federal civilian and military employees, as well as cost-of-living adjustments to several government transfer payments programs. * It said excluding these factors, incomes would have increased by 0.2 percent in January. COMMENTS: KEITH HEMBRE, CHIEF ECONOMIST, FAF ADVISORS, MINNEAPOLIS: "The overall spending number is a slight surprise on the upside. This puts consumer spending on better track for the first quarter than expected. We are looking at flat to slightly up quarter for consumer spending, but that's not going to be the case for GDP, which will be dragged down by housing and business investments." "This is good news that the rate of decline is not as steep, but the bad news is that government support doesn't create value due to borrowing and running a deficit. Ultimately what determines the long-term growth is increases in production and the labor force." KIM RUPERT, MANAGING DIRECTOR OF GLOBAL FIXED INCOME ANALYSIS, ACTION ECONOMICS LLC, SAN FRANCISCO: "It was a little bit surprising but it appears some of the income numbers were boosted by special factors, including some cost of living adjustments and a few other factors. "Nevertheless it was kind of the first piece of good news that the economy has gotten in a while. It's not clear it is going to shake the markets up a whole lot. "I think the focus will still be on the ongoing economic problems and various bailouts, but it seems to have taken some of the bid out of Treasuries." TIM O'SULLIVAN, CHIEF DEALER, FOREX.COM, BEDMINSTER, NEW JERSEY: "I think the personal income data is probably going to be pushed aside as we start to take a look and digest the information about the package that EU rejected over the weekend. I think that's far more important. "Consumer confidence levels are hitting all-time lows and everybody understands that the consumer in the United States is currently under water and does not look to be turning around anytime soon." VASSILI SEREBRIAKOV, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO, NEW YORK: "Personal spending and income were firmer than expected, and we're seeing the dollar slip a bit. We saw stronger retail sales in January and so it's not really a surprise that spending was up as well. Overall, it's mainly a risk appetite story -- better-than-expected data is good for the U.S. equity market and somewhat bad for the dollar." JOHN WILSON, CHIEF TECHNICAL STRATEGIST FOR EQUITY CAPITAL MARKETS, MORGAN KEEGAN, MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE: "Obviously the savings rate has gone up. It finally took this kind of fear to get people to save. The dollar is extremely strong; I think that goes with the saving. We're seeing worldwide fear, and on that, the dollar index may break new highs, though it is moving in a long-term historical range. "The important thing is the psychology of the market. Last week we thought we were poised for a long-awaited rally, whether something major or an oversold rally. The news coming out of Washington that we're going to raise taxes on the segment of our society that already contributes the most in taxes is not sitting well. "Today we have the market cutting Oct 2002 lows. The problem is that no one yet has a feel that the recession will end this year. The depth and duration of the recession is up for question and until people determine that, I think the market will have a tough time making a lot of progress." ZACH PANDL, ECONOMIST, NOMURA SECURITIES INTERNATIONAL, NEW YORK: "The underlying income trend is more like 2/10 of an increase given the special factors. The year is starting off on a slightly better footing. On the spending side, the figure in line with the earlier retail sales report, but it can't be sustained given the weakness of the consumer sector." SCOTT BROWN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, RAYMOND JAMES & ASSOCIATES, ST PETERSBURG, FLORIDA: "The income numbers were certainly higher than expected, but a lot of that was the social security payment adjustment." "There was a big increase in the savings rate to 5.0 percent. It is good that people save but it is not good that everybody saves at the same time. That makes the current downturn more severe and long lasting." "I don't think the numbers were that far out of line (with expectations). The bond market is looking more to the stock market for direction. We have a huge flight to safety because the stock market looks increasingly weak at this point." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. equity index futures pare losses. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices trim gains. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar pares gains versus euro.
