 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The White House said on Monday the latest government bailout of American International Group Inc was necessary to prevent the troubled insurer from posing a further threat to the financial system. 

 "Today's actions were critical," White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters. U.S. stocks tumbled after AIG got a new but not necessarily final government bailout following a record $61.7 billion quarterly loss, fueling fears that the global financial crisis is getting worse. Gibbs said the government had determined that "the risk of doing nothing was unacceptable."
