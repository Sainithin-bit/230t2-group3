 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. factory activity contracted again in February, but at a less severe rate, according to an industry report released on Monday. 

 U.S. construction spending dropped in January to its lowest level in more than four years, according to a government report on Monday, dragged down by the residential slump. KEY POINTS: * The Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity rose to 35.8 in February from 35.6 in January. * A reading below 50 indicates contraction in the sector. * Economists had expected a reading of 33.8, according to the median of their 74 forecasts in a Reuters poll, which ranged from 30.0 to 36.9. COMMENTS: CHARLIE SMITH, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, FORT PITT CAPITAL GROUP, GREENTREE, PENNSYLVANIA: "The manufacturers have so aggressively cut their inventories over the past 60 days that any slowing in inventory de-accumulation will result in slightly better numbers. "In Treasuries, the fear trade is dominating. However, the long bond is in this 3.5 percent to 3.6 percent area; a reflection that the absolute fear spike we saw in November and December has partially given back on concerns there will be so much supply in the next year." ANNA PIRETTI, SENIOR ECONOMIST, BNP PARIBAS, NEW YORK: ISM: "We have seen production deteriorating at rapid rate. I wouldn't read any positive news in today's report. This is still a low reading in recession levels. It's still painting a gloomy picture. "We came off a very weak quarter. We will have another negative quarter. The conditions in the labor market are very weak." CONSTRUCTION SPENDING: "The weakness in housing reintensified at the end of last year. This is continuing into 2009 and what's driving that is the sharp deterioration in job contraction. Some of the government programs will help but we will still see some of this weakness." DAVID SOWERBY, MARKET STRATEGIST, LOOMIS SAYLES, DETROIT: "A little better than expected but that's the difference between are you donating pints of blood or quarts of blood. "Just more in your face debilitating news on the economy, it's that simple. Amid all of this, at least you're seeing continued respectable news on prices paid. "The best you can say is there was no further deterioration in new orders." BORIS SCHLOSSBERG, DIRECTOR OF FX RESEARCH, GFT, NEW YORK: "The ISM's underlying details were not that impressive. The employment index was down and that should affirm the view that Friday's non-farm payrolls report could be as bad as many are expecting. At best, we can say there are some signs of stabilization, but it's hardly a bastion of optimism. It's nothing to crow about. So the initial burst of optimism could fade although the positive headline numbers fueled a relief rally in the dollar against the yen." GARY THAYER, SENIOR ECONOMIST, WACHOVIA SECURITIES, ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI: "It was better than expected which is some good news but it still shows manufacturing contracting, but not quite as broadly in February as in January. The breakdown of the report shows that the production component was up for a second consecutive month but the employment component continues to decline and that suggests companies are still trying to cut costs in this weak environment." WARREN SIMPSON, MANAGING DIRECTOR, STEPHENS CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS: "I think it's just the same old, same old. Obviously things are getting bad and they are steadily getting worse. The worst is yet to come. I think most people know that now and we just have to hang in there here -- there's not much else you can do. "I think what's really overhanging the market is AIG, we gave them all that money and they are obviously still bleeding terribly. They are mortally wounded. That's discouraging. That makes you discouraged on all the TARP and whether the stimulus package is going to work. AIG is the stench that has just overtaken the market, no doubt about it and it's not going to go away. What's next? I don't know. And the President is trying to push a huge budget through and I don't think that weighs well on the Street either." MICHAEL WOOLFOLK, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST, THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON, NEW YORK: "Take a look at the report which cites no expectation of a recovery in 2009 though some optimism about the impact of the stimulus package. It means very little for the dollar. Risk averse safe-haven buying of dollars remains the order of the day following some dreadful news from overseas. The PMIs were universally awful in Europe." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. equity indexes pare losses. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices pare gains. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar rises versus yen.
