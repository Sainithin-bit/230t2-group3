 (Reuters) - Swiss bank UBS AG ( UBSN.VX ) ( UBS.N ) is raising the base salary of its senior investment bankers after reducing many bonuses sharply, the New York Times said, citing two people briefed on the changes. 

 The step is part of a bigger overhaul of UBS's compensation system, the people, who spoke anonymously because the bank has not decided to publicly disclose the changes, told the paper. It aims to align overall compensation more closely with other financial services jobs, like consulting, the paper said. Some salaries for senior bankers are being raised to about 300,000 pounds ($429,400) from about 120,000 pounds ($171,800), still less than what they earned when they received bonuses, the paper said. A UBS spokesman in Hong Kong could not be immediately reached for comment by Reuters. UBS agreed to change its compensation practices when it received a Swiss government bailout last year and is slashing bonuses for its investment bank by more than 80 percent.
