 ST. JOHN'S (Reuters) - Antigua and Barbuda's government will move to take control of an offshore island which it discovered was owned by Texas billionaire Allen Stanford, accused of an $8 billion securities fraud, a government official said on Monday. 

 Guiana Island, which Stanford controlled through a British Virgin Islands company whose shares he acquired, constitutes an additional 1,500 acres held by the U.S. financier in the tiny Caribbean state at the heart of his business empire. Antigua and Barbuda's government obtained parliament's approval last week to seize 250 acres of Stanford-owned land following the February 17 announcement by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of fraud charges against the Texan. "We have just discovered further assets of Stanford -- some 1,500 acres," the government official, who asked not to be named, told Reuters by telephone. "Our main aim is to make sure that the lands are returned to Antigua," the official added. He said the cabinet would meet on Tuesday to decide whether it would seek to take control of Guiana Island through the same acquisition process it had applied to the 250 acres already targeted. "That's on the cards," he said. The SEC accuses Stanford, a colleague and three of their companies of carrying out a "massive Ponzi scheme" over at least a decade. The fraud case has rocked Antigua and Barbuda, a tiny twin-island state where the financier and sports entrepreneur held businesses and properties and is the biggest private investor and employer. Prime Minister Baldwin Spencer's government has made clear it wants to seize the Stanford land -- which includes plots housing his Antigua-based banks and companies, as well as beachside homes and development properties -- to mitigate the impact on the local economy of the fraud scandal. "The government felt that it needs to ensure that everything is secure ... It's more of a protective measure," the official told Reuters. (Reporting by  Pascal Fletcher , editing by Gerald E.
