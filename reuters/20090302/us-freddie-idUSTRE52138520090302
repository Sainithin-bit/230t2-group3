 (Reuters) Freddie Mac FRE.N on Monday said that David Moffett, its chief executive officer, would be resigning no later than March 13. The company expects to name an interim CEO before that time, and said the bard was working with the Federal Housing Finance Agency to name a successor. 

 Freddie Mac said it continues to estimate that FHFA will submit a request to the Treasury to draw an additional $30 billion to $35 billion under senior preferred stock purchase agreements. Shares of Freddie Mac fell a penny to 41 cents in premarket trade.
