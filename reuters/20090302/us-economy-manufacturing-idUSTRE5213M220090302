 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Factory activity contracted again in February, but at a less severe rate, according to an industry report released on Monday. 

 The Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity rose to 35.8 in February from 35.6 in January. A reading below 50 indicates contraction in the sector. Economists had expected a reading of 33.8, according to the median of their 74 forecasts in a Reuters poll, which ranged from 30.0 to 36.9.
