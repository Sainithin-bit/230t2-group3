 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks opened sharply lower on Monday, knocking world stocks deeper into bear territory, after a $61.7 billion quarterly loss at AIG and HSBC launched Britain's largest ever rights issue drove the dollar to 3-year highs and the price of bonds higher. 

 Renewed concerns about the health of the financial sector sparked a worldwide sell-off in risky assets, pushing oil down by more than 6 percent, as American International Group ( AIG.N ) posted the largest quarterly loss in U.S. corporate history. "AIG is the stench that has just overtaken the market, no doubt about it and it's not going to go away. What's next? I don't know," Warren Simpson, managing director at Stephens Capital Management in Little Rock, Arkansas. Also unnerving investors was HSBC, Europe's biggest bank, which launched an $18 billion rights issue to shore up its balance sheet after it reported a 18 percent fall in adjusted pretax profit for 2008 and sliced its dividend by 29 percent. Renewed skittishness about the financial sector fanned safety-seeking flows into government bonds across the board. Major stock indexes around the world slipped to new lows. MSCI's all-country world equity index .MIWD00000PUS slid more than 3 percent at one point and the Dow fell more than 2 percent after opening to below 7,000 for the first time since October 1997. The S&P 500 also slid more than 2 percent. Driving investor angst was uncertainty over when a worsening global recession, which many had hoped would soon begin to show signs of stabilizing, will abate. "The depth and duration of the recession is up for question and until people determine that, I think the market will have a tough time making a lot of progress," said John Wilson, chief technical strategist at Morgan Keegan in Memphis. Declining shares outnumbered advancing shares by more than 5 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange. At least 367 stocks touched new 52-week lows out of 2,937 stocks that had traded after half an hour of trade. After 10 a.m., The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was down 104.26 points, or 1.48 percent, at 6,958.67. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was down 11.03 points, or 1.50 percent, at 724.06. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was down 10.81 points, or 0.78 percent, at 1,367.03. European shares also were sharply lower, with the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of leading regional shares off 3.6 percent at 693.26 points. Banks were the biggest fallers on the index. HSBC ( HSBA.L ) lost 18.1 percent as investors viewed it as a bad harbinger. "We interpret HSBC's move as a signal that management does not expect a recovery in global macro for a long time. In HSBC, we see vulnerability to the collapse in world trade and rising balance sheet risk," Sandy Chen, an analyst at Panmure Gordon. AIG and HSBC enhanced the appeal of the dollar as a safe-haven currency, while the euro fell after European Union leaders rejected a mass bailout for Eastern Europe and a survey showed euro zone manufacturers suffering their worst month in 12 years. The dollar gained against a basket of major currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index .DXY up 0.59 percent at 88.688. The euro was down 0.44 percent at $1.2612, while against the yen, the dollar rose 0.24 percent to 97.75. "With all the negative news lately -- today from the U.S. insurance sector and the European summit -- the market is just not prepared to take on a lot of risk," said Dustin Reid, senior currency strategist at RBS Global Banking & Markets in Chicago. "So you're seeing people pile into the dollar." Government bonds rose. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note added 14/32 in price to yield 2.97 percent. The 2-year U.S. Treasury note rose 2/32 to yield 0.9385 percent. U.S. light sweet crude oil fell $2.72 to $42.04 a barrel. Spot gold prices fell $7.70 to $936.45. (Reporting by  Steven C.
