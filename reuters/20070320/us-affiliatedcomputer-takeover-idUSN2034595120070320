 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Affiliated Computer Services Inc.'s ( ACS.N ) founder said on Tuesday he and investment fund Cerberus Capital Management plan to take the computer services company private with a $5.9 billion buyout. 


 The move comes after ACS' chief executive and chief financial officer resigned last year following an investigation into backdated stock options. ACS is among nearly 200 companies that are being investigated for questionable options accounting. ACS founder and chairman Darwin Deason, who was not implicated in the options scandal, said he and Cerberus plan to buy ACS for $59.25 per share. That is a 15.5 percent premium over Monday's closing price. ACS shares rose 17 percent to $60.21 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange, and analysts said investors were betting on a competing bid. ACS entertained and rejected an offer from a group of private equity firms at the end of 2005. Some of those investors may now review their interest. "The door is open for another offer," said Jefferies & Co. analyst Joseph Vafi. "Darwin is clearly opening up invitations." The renewed prospects for ACS's sale come as the Dallas-based company seeks to emerge from a rough year in 2006 that tarnished its image with investors. Its CEO, Mark King, and its CFO, Warren Edwards, resigned in November after an internal probe determined they had violated the company's code of ethics through their role in improper stock options granting practices. Lynn Blodgett, formerly chief operating officer, was named CEO, and John Rexford was named CFO. The stock options investigation cost millions of dollars and cut into earnings, required the restatement of historical financial statements, and hurt the company's stock price. "The entire Street has lost confidence in the story. Doing something like this ensures that he (Deason) maintains control of the company," Vafi said of the buyout offer. ACS was not immediately available for comment. Based on the 100 million shares outstanding in ACS' latest regulatory filing, the Deason-Cerberus offer is worth about $5.925 billion. The offer is worth $8.2 billion including debt that would either be refinanced or remain outstanding, according to a statement from Deason. As of Monday, ACS shares had fallen about 19 percent over the last 12 months, compared with a 1.5 percent fall in shares of bigger rival Electronic Data Systems Corp. EDS.N. Deason, who founded ACS in 1988, said he and Cerberus are prepared to work together to negotiate a buyout immediately. As of December 31, Deason owned nearly 2 million ACS shares, or a 2.16 percent stake, according to a regulatory filing. Deason and Cerberus have engaged Citigroup Global Markets Inc. as financial adviser and to arrange financing related to the proposal. Deason would continue as executive chairman after a buyout, he said in his statement. Private equity firms such as Cerberus buy companies, then often cut jobs and costs to make the businesses more efficient before eventually selling them at a profit. In the six months ended December 31, ACS reported net income of $133 million on revenue of $2.8 billion. It had cash flow from operations of $305 million during that period.
