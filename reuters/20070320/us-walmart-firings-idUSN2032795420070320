 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) asserted in a court filing that two former top marketing officials engaged in a sexual relationship while choosing new advertising agencies and sought jobs with one of the agencies they recommended, The New York Times reported. 


 Wal-Mart accused Julie Roehm and Sean Womack of extending their visits with Draft FCB, an ad agency involved in the review, to spend more personal time together and to promote themselves to the agency as job candidates. Reached by the Times in Las Vegas, Roehm denied Wal-Mart's accusations of an affair with Womack, and said she had not had job discussions with Draft FCB. The Times said Womack did not return a call for comment. Roehm was abruptly fired from Wal-Mart on December 4 after less than a year as head of marketing communications. She has sued the company, claiming breach of contract and fraud. Womack, who was vice president of marketing communications, left the company at the same time as Roehm. Wal-Mart said in its request to file a counterclaim against Roehm that it would seek compensation from her for legal fees in the case and for other damages.
