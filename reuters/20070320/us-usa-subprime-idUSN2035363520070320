 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - New Century Financial Corp., once the largest independent provider of subprime mortgages, was dealt a fresh setback on Tuesday when Fannie Mae said it would no longer buy its loans made to borrowers with poor credit, while another big subprime lender filed for bankruptcy. 


 The privately held lender, People's Choice Home Loan Inc., joined more than two dozen home-financing firms that have sought Chapter 11 protection since the subprime crisis began at the end of 2006. The lenders were hit hard last week by news of a record number of U.S. home loans going into foreclosure, led by the subprime category, which includes borrowers with the weakest credit histories. Wall Street slid on fears that a much-anticipated bursting of the housing bubble might be taking place. But the market has recovered on signs that the sector might be improving. In one hopeful sign on Tuesday, Accredited Home Lenders Holding Co. LEND.O, a struggling subprime lender, said it managed to win fresh financing from a San Francisco hedge fund, helping it avert a cash crunch. The news boosted hopes that some financiers might see bargains in the battered subprimes. Also lifting sentiment was a government report that the pace of U.S. home construction rose 9 percent in February, beating analysts' forecasts. Still, building permits came in below expectations, extending their downtrend and capping optimism about a sustained upturn in new construction. MORE WOES FOR NEW CENTURY For New Century Financial Corp. ( NEWC.PK ), the Fannie Mae news was a new blow for a company whose lending practices were already under scrutiny by investigators in a number of states. Fannie Mae FNM.N severed business ties with New Century. which can no longer sell its loans to the No. 1 U.S. mortgage finance company. Once high-flying New Century has so far managed to avoid a much-predicted bankruptcy filing, but investors were losing faith in its chances. The latest news sent its stock down 16 percent, near an all-time low of $1.65 a share. People's Choice became the latest casualty on the subprime junk pile, joining Mortgage Lenders Network USA Inc., Ownit Mortgage Solutions Inc. and ResMae Mortgage Corp. Shares of many U.S. subprime lenders have dropped sharply in recent weeks as a rising wave of delinquencies prompted Wall Street investment banks to cut off a vital source of funding to the industry. Shares of Accredited, which had been falling, rose as much as 30 percent after it said it secured a five-year, $200 million loan from Farallon Capital Management. The loan carries an interest rate of 13 percent. Accredited shares gained $1.82, or 20 percent, to $10.77 after climbing as much as 30 percent before regular trading began. Any news of financing for the cash-strapped lenders or stability in the housing market has been a rallying point for investors. U.S. stocks and Treasury bond prices rose on Tuesday. Caution prevailed in most financial markets as Federal Reserve policy-makers began a two-day meeting that is expected to result in no change in benchmark interest rates. The housing data did nothing to change that perception. The Commerce Department said housing starts set an annual pace of 1.525 million units in February, compared with a 1.399 million unit pace in January. That was the sharpest month-over-month increase since a 13.1 percent rise in January 2006. Economists had forecast February housing starts to rise to a 1.45 million-unit pace from January's originally reported pace of 1.408 million units. The Dow  .DJI  and other major equity indexes were up more than 0.5 percent, extending Monday's rally, while benchmark 10-year Treasury notes were up 4/32 in price for a yield of 4.55 percent. SENATE BANKING COMMITTEE Subprime lenders are coming under increasing pressure from Washington. On Monday, U.S. Senate Banking Committee Chairman Chris Dodd, a Democrat and a U.S. presidential hopeful, said he asked executives at the top five subprime companies to explain their lending practices at a hearing on Thursday. The companies are HSBC Holdings Plc ( HSBA.L ), New Century Mortgage Corp, Countrywide Financial Corp. CFC.N, General Electric Co.'s ( GE.N ) WMC Mortgage unit and First Franklin Mortgage FFHS.O.
