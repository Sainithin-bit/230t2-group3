 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Subprime lender Accredited Home Lenders Holding Co. LEND.O, trying to avoid a cash crunch, said on Tuesday it had received a five-year, $200 million loan with an annual interest rate of 13 percent. 


 News of the distressed financing deal from San Francisco hedge fund Farallon Capital Management lifted Accredited shares 30 percent before regular trading began. Shares of U.S. subprime lenders, which make mortgages for borrowers with poor credit histories, have been hammered in recent weeks amid a rising wave of delinquencies and pulled funding by Wall Street investment banks. But any news of financing for the cash-strapped subprimes has been a rallying point for investors. Accredited shares surged $2.75 to $11.70 in early electronic trade. Last week, Accredited shares were trading at less than half that price. That's when Merrill Lynch sold about $389,000 worth of Accredited stock owned by company president Joseph Lydon in a forced liquidation under a loan and pledge agreement between the executive and the brokerage, U.S. regulatory filings show. The sale included 15 transactions on March 13, with an average share price of $5.35, a filing showed. Accredited said it received the $200 million commitment from Farallon. The hedge fund will receive 3.3 million warrants from Accredited, with an exercise price equal to $10 a share. That means Farallon could cash in those warrants and own about 14 percent of Accredited. Accredited said the loan, secured by the company and its subsidiaries, and the sale of $2.7 billion in mortgage loans -- although at a sharp discount -- are part of its goal to boost liquidity. The company, however, said it will continue to consider other strategic options.
