 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - IntercontinentalExchange Inc. ( ICE.N ) 
on Tuesday shot back at comments from Chicago Mercantile 
Exchange Holdings Inc. CME.N regarding ICE's proposed merger 
with CBOT Holdings Inc. BOT.N, parent of the number two U.S. 
futures exchange. 


  CME earlier set a meeting with shareholders of CBOT, parent 
of the Chicago Board of Trade, to defend its takeover deal. It 
termed some of the claims made in ICE's competing proposal last 
week "significantly exaggerated."  "CME's rhetoric will not fool CBOT shareholders," Jeffrey 
Sprecher, ICE chief executive, said in a statement. "The ICE 
proposal provides more than $1.3 billion, or over $25 per 
share, in additional current value, making it clearly 
financially superior."
