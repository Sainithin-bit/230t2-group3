 LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Blockbuster Inc. BBI.N Chairman and Chief Executive John Antioco will leave by year-end after agreeing to a smaller 2006 bonus and resolving a dispute over his pay package, the video rental chain said on Tuesday. 


 Antioco, at the helm for a decade, has been under pressure from board members to cut costs and boost profits rather than invest aggressively in an online business that competes with Netflix Inc. ( NFLX.O ) Billionaire investor and director Carl Icahn tried to oust Antioco from the board during a 2005 proxy battle and called his $54 million severance package at the time "unconscionable." Blockbuster shares were down 3.2 percent at $6.88 in mid-day trade, after falling as low as $6.77. Netflix shares were up 4.2 percent at $22.25. The company said it would pay Antioco a 2006 bonus of $3.05 million. That is more than the $2.28 million that was conditionally offered by the board but far short of the $7.65 million he was entitled to under his previous contract. Analysts were divided over what effect Antioco's departure would have on the share price going forward. "My guess is that as long as Antioco is there, they don't change anything," Wedbush Morgan analyst Michael Pachter said. "The impact should be positive short term, because ... Icahn wants the share price to go up. I really think Icahn just is impatient. He is not a long-term investor." LESS THAN ORIGINALLY ENTITLED But Citigroup analyst Tony Wible viewed the change as "disruptive during this critical transition period for Blockbuster." Wible added that Antioco could pressure Blockbuster's share price by selling his estimated 3 percent stake in the company. Under a revised employment agreement, Antioco will receive a $4.99 million payment at the end of his employment, the company said. This compared with the $13.5 million that he would have been entitled to if he had been terminated without cause under his previous contract. The revisions to Antioco's contract are unusual, because he will walk away with far less than he could have received. "This revised employment agreement allows for management continuity and ample opportunity for an orderly succession by the end of the year," Antioco said in a statement. Icahn abandoned plans to take control of the company last year in a tacit show of support for Antioco. "John and the company have reached terms that are clearly in the best interests of the stockholders," Icahn said in a statement on Tuesday. Bill Coleman, senior vice president of compensation at Salary.com, a Web site about pay and employment, said only a few high-powered institutional investors, such as Icahn, have the power to shake up boardrooms and negotiate such a deal with a departing CEO. "I suspect that perhaps Carl Icahn is looking at this as a way to make a mark and send a signal" about executive pay, he said. "Here we have a situation where you've got a company and a compensation committee and a CEO who have looked at the whole situation and settled for something other than the greediest possible solution," Coleman added. "I don't think it was a trivial undertaking to convince any CEO to accept this deal." For 2007, Antioco will receive a salary of $1.25 million, bonus of $2,025,000 and deferred compensation of $1.45 million, according to a Blockbuster filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
