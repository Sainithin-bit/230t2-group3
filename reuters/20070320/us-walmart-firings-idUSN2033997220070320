 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) has countersued a former marketing executive claiming she and a marketing colleague had a romantic relationship and used a review of advertising agencies to spend time together and seek jobs at one of those agencies. 


 In a suit filed on Monday, Wal-Mart accused former executives Julie Roehm and Sean Womack of misusing the agency review process and traveling at the company's expense ostensibly on Wal-Mart business in order to spend time together. Wal-Mart also charged the executives with accepting gifts from advertising agency DraftFCB, which was later chosen to handle Wal-Mart's ad account, and of discussing job opportunities with that agency. Interpublic Group of Cos. Inc. ( IPG.N ) is the parent company of DraftFCB. Roehm was fired by Wal-Mart on December 4 after less than a year as head of marketing communications at the world's largest retailer. She sued the company, claiming breach of contract and fraud. In its suit, filed as a counterclaim to Roehm's lawsuit, Wal-Mart quoted e-mails it said Roehm and Womack sent to each other as proof of their relationship. The suit cites one e-mail purportedly sent to Womack by Roehm as saying: "I think about us together all of the time. Little moments like watching your face when you kiss me." The message was preserved by Womack's wife, Wal-Mart said in the suit. The suit, first reported by The New York Times, said Womack admitted to having a sexual relationship with Roehm when confronted by his wife, but later tried to recant his story and tell his wife that there had been no affair. Wal-Mart said in the suit that the Womacks soon separated. Roehm and Womack could not be reached for comment. The New York Times story said Roehm denied Wal-Mart's accusations of an affair with Womack, and also denied that she had discussed job opportunities with DraftFCB. Wal-Mart said in the suit that Roehm had violated company policy that prohibits inappropriate relationships between supervisors and associates, and forbids accepting gifts from suppliers. The suit cited as an example Roehm letting DraftFCB pay more than $700 for dinner at Chicago's LuxBar. According to the suit, an employee at the ad agency made reservations and told the restaurant to deliver separate checks at the end of dinner. The suit said that when the separate checks arrived, Roehm handed hers to the agency's Chairman and Chief Executive Howard Draft. The suit said Womack had worked with Wal-Mart on a contract basis while employed by advertising agency Saatchi X, and that he was later made Wal-Mart's vice president of communications architecture, reporting to Roehm. Wal-Mart awarded its $580 million ad account to DraftFCB and Carat USA, part of Aegis Group Plc AGS.L, last October. The company dropped both agencies days after Roehm and Womack were fired in December and reopened bidding for the account. In January, Wal-Mart selected the Martin Agency, also part of Interpublic, and Publicis ( PUBP.PA ) to handle its account. Wal-Mart said in the suit it would seek compensation from Roehm for legal fees and other damages that were not specified in the court documents. Wal-Mart shares were up 71 cents at $47.30 late on Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange. (Additional reporting by  Jessica Wohl  in Chicago and  Michele Gershberg  in New York)
