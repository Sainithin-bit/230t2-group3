 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Jewelry and accessories retailer Claire's Stores Inc. CLE.N said on Tuesday that it would be acquired by private equity firm Apollo Management LP for about $3.1 billion. 


 Apollo will pay $33 per share for Claire's, which targets girls and young women with its baubles. Shares of Claire's traded at $31.86, up $1.10, or 3.6 percent, after the announcement. Claire's said members of its founding family, which owns a large portion of its voting shares, entered into a separate agreement to vote their shares in favor of the deal. The retailer put itself up for sale in December and hired Goldman Sachs to help it explore its options. Apollo had been the last bidder in the auction after another private equity firm, Apax Partners, walked away after failing to agree with the chain on a buyout price, according to retail trade publication Women's Wear Daily. Last week, Claire's said it would delay the release of its fourth-quarter results to clear up an accounting issue relating to lease rights for stores in France.
