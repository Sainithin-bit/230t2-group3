 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Tuesday as a series of takeover deals bolstered investor confidence and offset apprehension about the latest Federal Reserve rate-setting meeting. 


 Affiliated Computer Services Inc. ( ACS.N ) stock shot up nearly 17 percent after the company received a $5.9 billion buyout bid.  "The fact is, there's so many companies with such low leverage on their balance sheets. In aggregate, so many corporate balance sheets are in such good shape," said Lincoln Anderson, managing director and chief investment officer at LPL Financial Services in Boston. "That's what's driving the buyouts and takeovers." The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  ended up 61.93 points, or 0.51 percent, at 12,288.10. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  closed up 8.88 points, or 0.63 percent, at 1,410.94. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  finished up 13.80 points, or 0.58 percent, at 2,408.21. Optimism about the technology sector may roll into Wednesday's session after software makers Oracle Corp. ORCL.O and Adobe Systems Inc. ( ADBE.O ) both reported earnings that beat Wall Street expectations, sending shares of both stocks higher after the market close.  Oracle shares rose 3.9 percent to $18.24 in electronic composite trading. During the regular session, the stock added 2.2 percent. Adobe shares climbed 3.5 percent to $42.25 after the closing bell. Trading was moderate on the New York Stock Exchange, with about 1.45 billion shares changing hands, below last year's estimated daily average of 1.84 billion, while on Nasdaq, about 1.71 billion shares traded, below last year's daily average of 2.02 billion. Affiliated Computer Services' shares rose 16.9 percent to $59.95 on the NYSE after its founder, Darwin Deason, and investment fund Cerberus Capital Management offered to buy the computer services company. Shares of Palm Inc. PALM.O, the handheld computer and cell phone maker, rose on reports that the company may be close to a $2 billion buyout deal, with mobile phone makers Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ) and Motorola Inc. MOT.N said to be among the bidders. Palm shares ended up 3.5 percent at $18.77 on Nasdaq, while Motorola shares were up 2.9 percent at $18.82 on the NYSE. Subprime mortgage lender Accredited Home Lenders Holding Co. LEND.O secured financing, helping to quell fears that turmoil in the industry that lends to home buyers with sketchy credit would spawn wider trouble for the economy. Accredited Home shares surged 20.3 percent to $10.77 on the Nasdaq. For more details on the crisis in the subprime mortgage market. The Fed's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee began its two-day meeting on Tuesday. The Fed was expected to hold its benchmark federal funds rate steady at 5.25 percent, but investors will focus on its statement on the outlook for the economy and future interest rate policy, expected on Wednesday afternoon. On the downside, shares of oilfield services company Halliburton Co. ( HAL.N ) and those of its rivals declined after the company said its first-quarter profit will not meet Wall Street estimates due to decreased drilling completion in Canada and the northern United States. Halliburton stock was down 5.9 percent at $30.50 on the NYSE. BJ Services Co. BJS.N declined 2.7 percent to $26.62 and Weatherford International Ltd. ( WFT.N ) fell 1.8 percent to $44.36, both on the NYSE. In economic news, a government report showed a stronger-than-expected pace of home construction in February, easing concerns about the impact of subprime mortgage troubles on housing. <ID:nN20347031> Advancing stocks outnumbered declining ones by a ratio of about 5 to 2 on the NYSE and by more than 9 to 5 on the Nasdaq.
