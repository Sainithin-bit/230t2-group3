 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - A federal judge on Tuesday postponed the trial of a $40 billion lawsuit filed by Enron Corp. investors, a day after an appeals court ruled the complaint could not proceed as a class-action claim. 


 U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon in Houston signed an order delaying the trial, scheduled to start on April 16, pending the plaintiffs' appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. On Monday, investment banks Merrill Lynch and Co. Inc. MER.N and Credit Suisse Group ( CSGN.VX ) and Barclays Plc ( BARC.L ) won a huge victory when a federal appeals panel in New Orleans said Judge Harmon had erred when certifying the lawsuit as a class-action complaint. The banks, which had advised Enron on certain financial transactions, had argued Judge Harmon wrongly allowed investors to allege they were primary participants in the fraud that eventually led to Enron's collapse. The lawsuit has so far netted more than $7 billion for investors, including $2 billion or more each from Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce ( CM.TO ), J.P. Morgan ( JPM.N ) and Citigroup ( C.N ). Lawyers not involved in the case said it would be difficult for the plaintiffs to pursue claims against the deep-pocketed banks on an individual basis if the Supreme Court declines to hear the case or upholds the decision from the Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit.
