 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve policy-makers opened a two-day meeting on Tuesday likely to feature discussions about rising mortgage defaults and softer economic growth, but no change in U.S. interest rates. 


 The U.S. central bank's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee began meeting at about 2:30 p.m. (1830 GMT) and will announce its decision on rates on Wednesday at around 2:15 p.m. (1815 GMT). The consensus among economists was that the trend-setting federal funds rate will be held steady -- for a sixth straight session -- at 5.25 percent. But worry that a meltdown in the subprime mortgage market may hit the housing sector hard enough to hurt the broader economy could push discussion of future rate cuts to the surface. As if to emphasize the uncertainty in the outlook, a Commerce Department report issued before Fed officials began meeting on Tuesday showed housing starts climbed 9 percent in February to a 1.525-million unit a year pace. Still, with national growth already soft, the backdrop to the Fed gathering was one of concern that strains in the subprime mortgage market that caters to less credit-worthy borrowers could tip the risks that the economy faces toward undue slowing and away from inflation, which has been the primary concern of policy-makers for months. POISED TO REACT How the Fed characterizes its view of the outlook in the statement it will release outlining its decision will be dissected especially closely by financial markets. "The main question at this meeting is how to adjust the language," said economists Brian Sack and Laurence Meyer, a former Fed governor, in an advisory to clients of Macroeconomic Advisers LLC. Among factors the policy-makers must weigh are "the downward revision to fourth-quarter real GDP growth, a series of weaker indicator reports that have pushed down estimates of first-quarter growth, a blowout in the subprime market and broader financial turbulence," Sack and Meyer said. Late last month, the government said gross domestic product, the broadest measure of national economic output, grew at only a 2.2 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, a sharp downward revision from its initial 3.5 percent estimate. Some analysts feel growth may come in under 2 percent for the first three months this year. Financial markets have steadied in recent days since the global gyrations that followed a sharp fall in Shanghai stocks on February 27 and U.S. stock prices were moderately higher on Tuesday. MORTGAGE ANXIETY But the risk of rising defaults in the wobbling subprime mortgage sector is still in front of anxious policy-makers. That heightens pressure for the U.S. central bank to at least nod to the seriousness of the issue, which has aroused U.S. lawmakers to the point that they want the Fed and other bank regulators to testify on why they were not more alert to developing problems. "We expect Fed officials to sound more open to the possibility of easing, if necessary," said Maury Harris, chief economist for UBS Bank in New York, who is forecasting rate cuts later in the year. That means the Fed could start at least to lay the groundwork for a future rate change, even while holding the line now, in order to make financial markets aware that officials are ready and prepared to shift policy if necessary to keep the expansion from losing too much steam. "In economics, changes often matter more than levels, and we believe the message should be that Fed officials' perceptions of risk are evolving," Harris said.
