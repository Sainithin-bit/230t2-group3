 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co. said on Tuesday it would recall about 166,000 vehicles in the United States of the Accord, Odyssey and five other models to fix a faulty component in the fuel pump. 


 The defect in the pump, manufactured by Japan's Mitsuba Corp. , could cause the engine to stop and fail to restart, said a spokesman at Honda, Japan's second-biggest automaker. No accidents have been reported stemming from the defect. The same defect affected about 30,000 of the 528,400 vehicles Honda said it would recall in China last week, the spokesman said. A recall filing for vehicles using the same component will also shortly be made in Japan, he said. The cost of the recall is still unknown, he said. Subject to the recall are some Accord, Accord hybrid, Odyssey, Acura TL, Acura RL, Acura TSX vehicles from the 2005 model year and some 2006 Ridgeline pickup trucks. Shares in Mitsuba were down 1.4 percent at 974 yen at the midday break, while Honda was up 1.2 percent at 4,180 yen.
