 CLAYCOMO, Missouri  (Reuters) - President George W. Bush used visits to struggling U.S. automakers on Tuesday to pitch his energy agenda, promoting cars that use less or no gasoline as a way to cut oil use and tailpipe emissions. 


 Bush toured General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. plants in the Kansas City area in symbolic stops also aimed at easing strained ties with distressed companies that were once mainstays of the economy. He also urged Congress to act swiftly on his energy proposals to boost use of alternatives to gasoline-only vehicles, like electricity, gasoline/electric hybrids and ethanol/gasoline blends. The plan would also require a new conservation mandate the auto industry is resisting. "That would be a good sign that we recognize that we have a problem here in America and we aim to solve it together," Bush said at Ford's assembly plant in Claycomo, Missouri. Sharp cuts in gasoline consumption to reduce oil imports and lowering emissions to combat global warming are energy security priorities in Washington. On the 2008 presidential campaign on Tuesday, former Sen. John Edwards, a Democrat, planned to propose an "aggressive but achievable" goal of cutting emissions by 80 percent by 2050. GM, Ford and Chrysler Group. lost a combined $16 billion last year and embraced part of the White House energy plan to help revive sales. They also want to improve their image with consumers who are choosing more fuel-efficient vehicles made by Japan's Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. in greater numbers. Critics of U.S.-based auto companies have said they were short-sighted in chasing profits from gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles and pickups when fuel was cheap in the 1990s and were caught flat-footed when prices soared and consumer demand for their products waned. Automakers are now ramping up production changes and promising new products as the price of gas continues to head higher this year. Gas has risen for seven straight weeks in the United States and is 7.3 cents higher than a year ago at $2.58 per gallon, the government reported on Monday. 'RELEVANT' VEHICLES Bush irritated the industry when he said last year that bailouts were out and urged U.S.-based car companies -- now in the midst of wrenching restructurings -- to make "relevant" vehicles to better compete. On his trip to the Midwest where ethanol is produced and sold, Bush viewed gasoline/electric hybrid engines and vehicles at the GM facility in Fairfax, Kansas, and saw similar technology at the Ford location. "What you're proving here is a car or a truck doesn't have to look like a golf cart if you're running on electricity. It can be a normal size vehicle that people like to drive, Texans like to use pickup trucks as you well know," Bush said. The administration believes changes in auto industry practices would be the most dramatic way to cut petroleum use. Gasoline demand accounts for nearly half of the average daily U.S. consumption of 20.9 million barrels of oil. Late on Monday, the administration proposed legislation to reduce gasoline use by 20 percent over the next decade, mainly through the use of hybrids and alternative fuels. The proposal would require that autos use 35 billion gallons of alternative fuels by 2017, which is the equivalent of 15 percent of projected gas use in that year. The mandate is a nearly five-fold increase over figures in a 2005 energy law. Many energy experts, however, doubt the United States will be able to make the scientific breakthroughs necessary to meet the fuels goal. Bush also wants more efficient cars that run on gas. The auto industry opposes his plan to increase mileage standards by 4 percent annually to 34 miles per gallon by 2017. Ford, GM and Chrysler have instead agreed to double, to 2 million, the number of cars and trucks capable of running on renewable fuels by 2010.
