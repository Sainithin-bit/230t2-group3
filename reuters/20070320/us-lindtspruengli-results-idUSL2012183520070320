 ZURICH  (Reuters) - Swiss chocolate maker Lindt & Spruengli confirmed its mid-term outlook as 2006 net profit rose 21 percent, boosted by North American consumers developing a taste for its Lindor pralines and its chocolate bars. 


 Lindt & Spruengli ( LISP.S )( LISN.S ), whose famous gold bunnies are hitting shops in time for Easter, said on Tuesday desire for premium chocolate had strengthened its position in Europe and North America as it unveiled its largest ever investment program. Net profit rose to 209 million Swiss francs ($172.3 million) in 2006, in line with the average forecast in a Reuters poll of 11 analysts, on net sales up 15 percent at 2.59 billion francs. The group, which makes a broad range of chocolates including Kirsch batons and Easter eggs, generated North American sales of more than $500 million. "Year for year our two brands Lindt and Ghirardhelli are enjoying double-digit growth, year for year our two brands are growing fastest and year for year we are winning market share," Chief Executive Officer Ernst Tanner said at a news conference. The group, which has developed Lindor pralines filled with mint or peanut butter to cater for North American tastes, said it would again increase its marketing projects in the area in the coming years. London cocoa futures rose to their highest point in more than two years on Tuesday. Cocoa prices have risen steadily since November 2006 amid mounting concerns about dry weather in West Africa, the world's top cocoa producing region. By 1323 GMT, Lindt participation certificates -- the most commonly traded form of its stock -- were changing hands 0.59 percent lower at 3,025 francs per share, in line with a slightly weaker market. Lindt & Spruengli, which traces its origins back to a Zurich confectionery shop in the 1840s, has benefited from increased consumer spending on indulgence foods such as chocolates. The group, whose products have featured in Hollywood films, confirmed its medium-term sales growth target of between 6 and 8 percent and its 8 to 10 percent mid-term operating profit growth goal. "Taking into account the current economic forecast and the favorable consumer sentiment, we are confident that these targets can be beaten again in the short-term, in the current year, 2007," Tanner said. The company said it had outpaced the growth of the overall chocolate market many times over, thus gaining market share. Tanner said the group planned investments worth more than $413 million over three years to expand plants and to improve the processing, storage and logistics at its facilities. SWEET SUCCESS "The results were strong, and the company benefits from the trend to premium chocolate, particularly among Anglo-Saxon countries, which have traditionally preferred their chocolate cheap and sugary," Kepler Equities analyst Jon Cox said. "Excellent products, excellent management. However, we have a question mark about valuation and believe it benefited from problems with competitors last year, for example at Nestle ( NESN.VX ), Cadbury CBRY.L, Hershey ( HSY.N ), which might not happen again in 2007," he said. Lindt shares are trading at about 28 times estimated earnings, while rival Swiss chocolate maker Barry Callebaut ( BARN.S ) is trading at around 24 times, according to Reuters data. Operating profit rose 19.4 percent to 297 million francs, giving an operating margin of 11.5 percent. The group said it would propose raising its dividend to 275 francs per registered share from 225 francs and to 27.50 francs per participation certificate from 22.50 francs.
