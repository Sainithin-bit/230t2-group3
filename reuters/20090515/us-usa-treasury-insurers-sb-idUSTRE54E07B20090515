 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department said on Thursday that four insurers had been approved for access to the government's bank bailout plan. 

 A Treasury spokesman said Hartford Financial, Prudential Financial Group, Lincoln National Corp and Prudential Financial Inc met requirements for access to the government's Capital Purchase Program. The firms qualified because of their status as bank holding companies and because they each applied for access prior to a November 14, 2008, deadline, the Treasury spokesman said.
