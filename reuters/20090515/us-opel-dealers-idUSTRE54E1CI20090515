 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Opel's 4,000 dealers in Europe aim to invest half a billion euros on buying a stake in the ailing German carmaker and securing a seat in its boardroom. 

 Following a meeting in Vienna on Friday, the umbrella association Euroda said all national dealership organizations bar Finland had voted in favor of a plan to each pay into a fund that would finance a stake of between 10-20 percent. "It could be a historic first that (sees) dealers take an appreciable stake in a carmaker and have a certain influence on (its) policies," Euroda Vice-Chairman Albert Still told reporters during a conference call. Euroda -- which together with Opel's 50,000 European workers would aim to hold a blocking minority in any new Opel company -- said it plans to start talks with the carmaker's parent General Motors next week as well as with European governments that host its plants. "We will provide a total amount of up to 500 million euros ($677 million) over three years through a contribution of 150 euros per new vehicle (sold)," Euroda Chairman Jaap Timmer said. "In return we demand a fair equity share in the new company, representation on the supervisory board and obviously a fair financial return on our investment." Still added that the dealership group wanted "to signal to politicians ...that it makes sense to invest in Opel." Berlin has yet to reach a decision on whether to give the carmarker billions of euros in state aid. OUTCOME UNCLEAR Euroda would not at this point lend its backing to takeover plans for Opel being considered by either Fiat or Magna and its Russian backers, GAZ and state-controlled lender Sberbank. Thomas Bieling, one of the two co-chairmen of German Opel dealers' organization VDOH, had voiced skepticism regarding Fiat's interest due in part to strained relations between the Italian carmaker and its German dealers. Still said it was uncertain whether Euroda's plans would be realized, but Timmer added that GM Europe President Carl-Peter Forster has repeatedly welcomed such a move. Euroda wants to amend the existing dealer contracts to include fund contribution to ensure all member met their financial commitments. Aachen-based dealer Esko Thuellen told Reuters ahead of the meeting that the funds would place a burden on dealers, who often earn very thin margins, and that he would prefer an investment model "where (we) don't have to contribute or only need to do so to a smaller extent."
