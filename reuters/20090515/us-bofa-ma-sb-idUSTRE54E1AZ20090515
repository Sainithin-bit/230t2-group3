 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Bank of America appointed Michael Cho, a South Korea-focused investment banker, as head of Asia M&A, according to a memo obtained by Reuters on Friday. 

 Cho moved to Asia in 1996 after a stint in Merrill Lynch's San Francisco-based technology M&A group. David Petrie was also named head of Australia M&A, the memo said. Bank of America confirmed on Thursday that Asia Pacific M&A head Kalpana Desai was leaving the bank, the latest in a series of high level departures. The bank has seen several Merrill defections this year. Alan Hartman, previously head of M&A for the Americas at Merrill, and two top Merrill healthcare bankers left BofA last month to join boutique firm Centerview Partners. Merrill was not an early comer to Asia, but about five years ago it quickly built up its banking business to handle the region's booming economic growth. Merrill went from 12th place in 2007 on the M&A Asia (ex Japan) league table to 5th spot last year, with 39 completed deals worth $36.2 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.
