 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks and oil prices turned south on Friday on resurgent worries following the recent rally in the face of economic data that still show a mixed picture of when economies will pull out of a deep global recession. 

 The dollar and yen rose as worries persisted about global prospects despite better-than-expected U.S. economic news, prompting investors to seek shelter in the two currencies. Gold climbed to a six-week high after data showed U.S. core inflation rose more than expected in April, boosting the precious metal's appeal as a hedge against rising prices. Oil fell toward $56 a barrel, pressured by forecasts of weak global demand and the stronger dollar. U.S. economic reports that suggested the recession's worst phase was past were eclipsed by worries about weak demand for oil. Reports showing the euro-zone economy contracted at its fastest pace on record added to worries on when economies will turn the corner. The euro-zone economy shrank 2.5 percent quarter-on-quarter at the end of March, and 4.6 percent from the same period a year ago, driven by a plunge in German output. "We had some negative news coming from Europe earlier today," said Michael Woolfolk, a senior currency analyst at The Bank of New York Mellon, noting the "market remains jittery." U.S. stocks turned lower after early gains due to the expiration of option contracts and a fresh assessment of a jobs report on Thursday that was worse than expected, said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in New York. "Yesterday's rally, given the news, caught people off guard and left the market in a place where no one's quite sure of the next direction," Meckler said. Equity options and some options on stock indexes stopped trading at Friday's close. Options expiration is typically orderly, but volatility can occur as players unwind positions against stock and index products. The CBOE volatility index .VIX jumped 6.1 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  closed down 62.68 points, or 0.75 percent, at 8,268.64. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  fell 10.19 points, or 1.14 percent, at 882.88. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  declined 9.07 points, or 0.54 percent, at 1,680.14. European shares closed higher, with gains for most banks outweighing losses for defensive plays such as telecoms. The FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of top European shares rose 0.5 percent to close at 839.94 points. Over the week, the index fell 3.1 percent, but is up 30 percent from a lifetime low on March 9. But analysts were skeptical about when, and how strongly, an economic recovery will come through. "We've had a spectacular rally," said Philip Lawlor, chief portfolio strategist at Nomura. "Risk appetite has rebuilt. The question is about more green shoots. "I don't think the data is actually going to turn positive for another six or nine months," he said. U.S. and euro-zone government debt slipped after U.S. industry and consumer sentiment reports bolstered hopes the economy might soon start to recover. U.S. industrial production fell 0.5 percent in April, a more modest pace than in recent months and less than the 0.6 percent economists had expected. The data dimmed the allure of safe-haven investments such as U.S. Treasuries. Separate reports showing improved national consumer sentiment and a slower rate of contraction in New York state manufacturing this month also trimmed flight-to-safety bids. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell 13/32 in price to yield 3.14 percent. The 2-year U.S. Treasury note fell 1/32 in price to yield 0.86 percent. The dollar rose against a basket of major currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index .DXY up 0.63 percent at 82.952. The euro fell 1.03 percent at $1.3492. Against the yen, the dollar was down 0.78 percent at 95.12. Equity market losses and moderate gains in the dollar against other currencies also encouraged selling in the commodities markets. U.S. crude for June delivery fell $2.28 to settle at $56.34 a barrel, down from a six-month high of more than $60 hit earlier this week. London Brent for July fell $2.61 to $55.98 a barrel. The losses came after the International Energy Agency, the Energy Information Administration, and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries downgraded in recent days their forecasts for global energy demand in 2009. U.S. gold futures for June delivery settled up $2.90 at $931.30 an ounce in New York. Overnight in Asia stocks rose as investors bought shares that would benefit from a global recovery.
