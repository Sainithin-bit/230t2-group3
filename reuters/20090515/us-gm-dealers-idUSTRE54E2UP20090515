 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp is expected to announce details of its U.S. dealer consolidation plans on Friday, just over two weeks before the automaker's deadline to complete a sweeping restructuring that could include bankruptcy. 

 GM's dealership count is expected to drop by about 2,000 from the roughly 6,000 it has now, but GM has not said how many would be terminated, lost when it sheds the Saturn, Hummer and Saab brands and how many would fold due to financial strain. The automaker's North American sales vice president, Mark LaNeve, is scheduled to host a conference call at noon EDT on Friday to discuss the consolidation activities. The announcement comes the day after GM rival Chrysler announced plans to terminate 789, or 25 percent, of its 3,189 dealerships as of June 9 and GM mapped out a legal strategy similar to the one Chrysler has been using should the largest U.S. automaker be forced to seek bankruptcy protection.
