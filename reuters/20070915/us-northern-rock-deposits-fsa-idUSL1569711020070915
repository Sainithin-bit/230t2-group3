 LONDON  (Reuters) - Britain's financial watchdog reiterated on Saturday that it considers mortgage bank Northern Rock to be solvent and that problems customers are facing in withdrawing money are not linked to its financial health. 

 Shares in Northern Rock NRK.L plunged on Friday, and customers clamored to withdraw money, after the bank agreed an emergency loan from the Bank of England to cope with a lack of liquidity and high interest rates in money markets. "The FSA reiterates that it judges Northern Rock to be solvent and that savers can continue to deposit and withdraw funds," the Financial Services Authority (FSA) said in a statement. "Clearly, there have been some operational problems with queues at some branches and difficulties with the bank's website caused by the unusually high volumes of customers trying to access their accounts as a result of the publicity surrounding Northern Rock. "These problems are entirely logistical and are in no way related to the bank's solvency or its underlying ability to deliver funds to savers who wish to withdraw." FSA Chairman Callum McCarthy added: "To be absolutely clear, if we believed that Northern Rock was not solvent, we would not have allowed it to remain open for business."
