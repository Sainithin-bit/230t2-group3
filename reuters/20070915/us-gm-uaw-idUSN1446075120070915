 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Negotiators from General Motors Corp and the United Auto Workers union returned to the bargaining table on Saturday for a third day of intensive talks aimed at clinching a labor contract for the largest U.S. automaker. 

 The union agreed to extend its now-expired labor contract with GM on an hour-to-hour basis late Friday night. That move stoked expectations the two sides were nearing a deal after eight weeks of bargaining and avoided the threat of an immediate and potentially crippling strike. The contract talks, which have hinged on GM's push to cut its health care costs with a new plan for retirees, were set to restart around 10 a.m. ET on Saturday, a person familiar with the schedule said. Negotiators began arriving at the GM building to resume talks after 9 a.m., the person said. Both sides had agreed to break for about five hours after a marathon bargaining session that began early Friday and brought GM Chief Executive Rick Wagoner into direct negotiations with UAW Chief Ron Gettelfinger for the first time in the talks. GM and UAW declined to comment on the progress of the talks, which will affect more than 73,000 hourly workers and almost 270,000 blue-collar retirees. The UAW on Thursday singled out GM as its "strike target," a term it had avoided in more collegial negotiations in 2003. Rival automakers Ford Motor Co. and privately held Chrysler LLC signed contract extensions with UAW, clearing the way for their union-represented workers to continue working. The Detroit-based automakers lost more than $15 billion in 2006 and have cut more than 80,000 jobs through buyouts driven by plant closings. Given the industry's weakness, analysts have viewed a strike as unlikely. The last major UAW strike against GM was in 1998, when a 59-day walkout at two GM parts plants caused shortages that eventually shut down almost all of the automaker's assembly plants and caused sales to plummet. GM never recovered its pre-strike U.S. market share of 31 percent and has lost about 7 percentage points since. RATCHETING UP THE PRESSURE Wall Street analysts have been optimistic that GM would clinch a deal that slashes health care expenses that totaled $4.8 billion last year. Membership in the UAW has dropped to about 540,000, just over a third of its peak in 1969, reflecting the toll foreign competition has taken on U.S. automakers. Despite its waning size and influence, the UAW has historically negotiated pay and benefit packages considered the gold standard for organized labor in a U.S. economy where less than 10 percent of all private workers remain unionized. The contract talks have been dominated by complex negotiations over the idea of cutting billions of dollars in GM's health-care expenses by funding a new stand-alone trust fund to pay for retiree care. The two sides continue to spar over how many billions of dollars the automaker would offer for such a fund -- known as a voluntary employee beneficiary association, or VEBA -- and how large a discount the UAW would accept. Two union officials familiar with the UAW's stance said the union sought a job security guarantee in exchange for a VEBA. Another key unresolved issue was how deep a discount GM would be allowed as it looks to make a one-time payment to clear a long-term liability for retiree health care estimated at over $50 billion, people familiar the discussions said. Wall Street analysts have said they expect GM might be able to convince the UAW to take over retiree health care for between 50 cents and 70 cents on the dollar. One UAW official briefed on the talks said both sides appeared to be nearing agreement toward the higher end of that range. But Gregg Shotwell, a veteran GM employee and UAW dissident, said a fund earmarked for retiree health care would be a "hard sell" for the union. "The UAW has lost credibility over job security," he said. "Nobody believes it anymore." (Additional reporting by  David Bailey , Ben Lamothe, Dave Rogers and Kevin Krolicki)
