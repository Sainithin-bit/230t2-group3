 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp and the United Auto Workers union continued labor talks past the Friday deadline, while union members were told the current contract would be extended on an "hour-to-hour" basis. 

 GM and the UAW have been in talks to replace a four-year labor contract for eight weeks. The union had set a deadline of 11:59 pm EDT on Friday and had threatened to call a strike against the largest U.S. automaker. Both sides continued to talk in the early hours of Saturday, a source close to the talks told Reuters. "It's been extended hour to hour," UAW Local 160 President Jerry Gillespie said of the GM contract.
