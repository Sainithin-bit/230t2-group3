 DETROIT  (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers has told local union leaders negotiations with General Motors Corp. were continuing with some news expected shortly, a local UAW official told Reuters on Saturday. 

 "From what I hear it sounds like a settlement, not a strike," the official said on condition of anonymity. Both sides returned to the bargaining table on Saturday for a third day of intensive talks. The union has agreed to extend it now expired labor contract on an hour-to-hour basis.
