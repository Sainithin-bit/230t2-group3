 LONDON  (Reuters) - British mortgage bank Northern Rock said on Saturday it had not drawn down any of the money from the emergency facility it had arranged with the Bank of England so far. 

 Shares in Britain's eighth-biggest listed bank plunged on Friday after it disclosed the emergency facility and customers scrambled to withdraw their savings. A source close to the matter said customers had withdrawn about 250 million pounds ($505 million) from Northern Rock branches on Friday, or around 1 percent of total deposits. The Financial Times newspaper said around 1 billion pounds of deposits were withdrawn on Friday, including online withdrawals. Northern Rock declined to comment on the level of withdrawals.
