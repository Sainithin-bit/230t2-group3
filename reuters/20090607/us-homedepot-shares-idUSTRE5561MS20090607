 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Home Depot's ( HD.N ) stock price "looks like a bargain" as the home improvement has slowed expansion and tried to improve customer service under Chief Executive Frank Blake, according to the latest issue of Barron's. 

 In its June 8 edition, Barron's quotes research from analyst Deborah Weinswig of Citigroup Global Markets, who writes "We believe that Home Depot is going to be the stock to own going into its current fiscal year, and we would be buyers at current levels." Barron's suggests that at $25 a share, "Home Depot's battered stock price looks like a bargain as a leveraged play on an economic rebound beginning over the next 12 months or so." The weekly says the stock could rise into the $30s. (Reporting by  Paul Thomasch ; Editing by  Diane Craft )
