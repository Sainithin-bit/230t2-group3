 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Federal safety regulators have opened a probe into some Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) SUVs due to complaints that the liftgate windows can shatter without warning and are also looking at some GM and Honda SUVs for different issues. 

 The preliminary investigations by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration were posted on the agency's website on Monday. The NHTSA also opened investigations into faulty gas gauges in 865,000 General Motors Co ( GM.N ) sport utility vehicles as well as Honda Motor Co Ltd ( 7267.T ) CR-V SUVs for a defect in the headlights. There were 18 complaints that the liftgate glass on the rear doors or hatches on 200,000 Ford Escapes and Mercury Mariners could shatter when the gate was opened or closed, according to safety regulators. In one incident, a consumer reported that she and her 10-year-old son were cut by glass fragments, NHTSA said. Many of the incidents occurred during cooler temperatures. Ford issued a technical service bulletin in November 2010 for the vehicle, titled "Broken Liftgate Window Glass - Built on or before 10/15/2010," according to NHTSA. The bulletin reads: "Some 2010-2011 Escape and Mariner vehicles built on or before 10/15/2010 may experience the liftgate window glass breakage, typically when colder ambient temperatures are present." NHTSA opened an investigation to determine the extent of the issue, the agency said on its website. The safety agency also opened an investigation covering 288,000 Honda CR-V SUVs from model years 2002 to 2004 for complaints that the headlights stopped working. NHTSA said it has received 12 complaints alleging both low-beam headlights stopped working simultaneously. "Several of the complainants report the headlight switch and its wiring harness connector required replacement to repair the low beam head light circuit," NHTSA said. "It was also reported the switch and connector had become damaged by overheating/melting." Federal regulators are also investigating 865,000 GM SUVs for potential faulty fuel gauges that could mistakenly tell drivers their vehicles have more gas than they do. NHTSA said it opened a preliminary investigation covering Chevrolet Trailblazers, GMC Envoys, Buick Rainiers and Saab 9-7s from model years 2005-2007 after receiving 668 complaints alleging inaccurate fuel gauge readings. Of the complaints over the weekend, 58 incidents were alleged to result in a vehicle stall and 43 of those occurred because the fuel level reading indicated more fuel than what was actually in the tank, NHTSA said. One complaint alleged the affected vehicle stalled while exiting the interstate and was struck from behind, according to NHTSA. NHTSA said the complaints show an apparent increasing trend, with most complaints received within the past year. Spokesmen for GM, Ford and Honda said their companies are cooperating with NHTSA.
