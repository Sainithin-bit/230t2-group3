 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Prospects for global growth have deteriorated over the past month and developed economies are headed for the first full-year contraction since World War II, the International Monetary Fund said on Thursday. 

 The IMF said it now expects 2009 global economic growth of 2.2 percent, down 0.8 percentage point from its October forecast. While government efforts to cushion the blow were helping, more steps were warranted, the fund said. "Market conditions are starting to respond to these policy actions, but even with their rapid implementation, financial stress is likely to be deeper and more protracted than envisaged (in October)," the IMF said in a statement. "There is a clear need for additional macroeconomic policy stimulus relative to what has been announced thus far," the IMF added. "Room to ease monetary policy should be exploited." The Bank of England made a shock 1-1/2 percentage point cut in interest rates on Thursday while both the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank reduced rates by one-half point. The IMF now expects the U.S. economy to contract by 0.7 percent next year, compared with its October forecast for 0.1 percent growth. In countries using the euro currency, the economy will likely shrink by 0.5 percent in 2009, down from the October forecast of 0.2 percent growth. It forecast a 1.3 percent decline for the British economy next year. In emerging and developing economies, the IMF now expects 2009 growth of 5.1 percent, down a full point from its October forecast, in part because of falling commodity prices. While that has helped ease the inflation burden on rich countries, it is hurting commodity exporters. The IMF lowered its 2009 baseline oil price projection to $68 per barrel from $100, and noted prices had also fallen for metals and food. The fund warned that conditions could get even worse as financial firms reduce their debt, investors brace for rising corporate defaults and consumers cut back on spending. "The forceful policy responses in many countries have contained the risks of a systemic financial meltdown," the IMF said. "Nonetheless, there are many reasons to remain concerned about the potential impact on activity of the financial crisis." The IMF said policy responses could be "reinforced, clarified and better coordinated and thereby foster a more rapid recovery in lending and demand."
