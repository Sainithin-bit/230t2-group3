 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Private-equity company Blackstone Group LP ( BX.N ) on Thursday reported a $509 million third-quarter loss and said it had cut the value of a number of the companies in its portfolio as equity markets tumbled. 

 The New York-based company, one of the world's biggest private equity firms, has been hammered as the year-long financial crisis has practically shut down the credit markets. A revival in leverage is vital for the business to be able to do deals of any significant scale. "It's relatively clear at this point that we're heading to a good-sized recession," Blackstone's chief executive, Stephen Schwarzman, said on a conference call. "No one can predict how deep or long it will be. We can see indicators from our portfolio companies that this is happening, particularly in the U.S. and Europe." Blackstone said in a statement that unless market conditions improve markedly, its fourth-quarter payout might be "significantly lower" than the 30 cents a unit it pays now, or it might have "no distribution at all." But the company said on the conference call that it expects sufficient cashflow to meet a distribution of $1.20 per public unit for 2009. Public shareholders receive distributions ahead of Blackstone personnel. James said the 2009 distribution "looks pretty secure." For the fourth quarter, Blackstone said it would weigh the cashflow for the year versus the near-term outlook for 2009 to determine how much it pays out. Blackstone shares were down 9.3 percent to $7.80 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares are trading at about a quarter of their June 2007 initial public offering price of $31. So far, Blackstone has proven to be a poor investment choice for sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corp, which bought its original stake in the company just before the IPO and has seen the value of its investment sink. CIC intends to raise its stake from 9.9 percent to 12.5 percent by purchasing Blackstone shares on the open market, a source familiar with the matter said last month. "I think you have a business where you have great opportunities for investments," said Dan Fannon, research analyst at investment bank Jeffries. "But you are also dealing with the impact of everything purchased over the last two to three years at high multiples with a lot of leverage that will be negatively impacted by the economic environment." Fannon said he has a "hold" recommendation on the stock. LOSS IS WORSE THAN EXPECTED The company reported a third-quarter loss of $509.3 million before income taxes, non-cash charges for vesting equity-based compensation, and amortization of intangible assets -- a measure it calls "economic net income." On a per-share basis, the after-tax loss was 44 cents -- much worse than analysts had expected. Wall Street's average forecast was for the company to break even on a per-share basis, according to Reuters Estimates. Blackstone prefers to focus on economic net income because of the huge payouts associated with its more than $4 billion initial public offering in June 2007. On the basis of generally accepted accounting principles, its third-quarter loss was $365.5 million, compared with a loss of $107.3 million a year earlier. The year-earlier economic net income was a profit of $229 million, or 21 cents a share after taxes. Blackstone's chief operating officer, Tony James, said that since the start of the year the company had written down the value of about a third of the companies in its portfolio. The rest had either been written up or were unchanged. That does not include stakes Blackstone owns in public companies. The company has taken part in some of the largest leveraged buyouts ever, including the $23 billion purchase of Equity Office Properties Trust. But it has suffered along with the rest of the private equity industry as the credit crunch has frozen the debt markets to large leveraged buyouts. James said the firm was seeing improvement in the credit markets, which he thought had bottomed out. He said access to debt for private equity has been limited, but "as a preferred customer of the banks, we think we are better situated than most to continue to get support for deals." Blackstone has repeatedly said it sees great opportunity to buy assets as the markets fall, despite the limited leverage available. "We are convinced we are going into a really remarkable period to buy assets at low prices in almost all of the asset classes we invest in," said Schwarzman.
