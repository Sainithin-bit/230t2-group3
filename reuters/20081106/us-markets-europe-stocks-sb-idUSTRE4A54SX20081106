 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - European shares traded lower in the early afternoon on Thursday, extending losses after a widely expected European Central rate cut failed to offset worries about a weakening economic outlook. 

 By 1314 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 3 percent at 924.28 points, following the ECB decision to cut interest rates by 50 basis points to 3.25 percent. The index had hit low of 911.3 points early in the session, but had pared back losses after a hefty Bank of England rate cut. "It is clear the markets would react to a 50 basis point cut by the ECB negatively because, in the end, it was fully priced in," said FrankfurtFinanz analyst Heino Ruland. "There were a lot of people hoping for a cut of 75 points because the economy is contracting in a way I haven't ever seen." The Bank of England at midday slashed rates by 1.5 percentage points to 3 percent. Most economists polled by Reuters had forecast a half-point BoE cut although several had changed their forecasts following a series of gloomy data. "In the wake of England's interest rate cut, there was probably at least one or the other investor who had speculated on a bigger cut in ECB rates," said Giuseppe-Guido Amato, investment analyst at Lang & Schwarz. Britain's central bank has never cut interest rates by more than half a point since it was made independent in 1997. "This decision is unprecedented and the market is going to be confused for a time by it," said Jim Wood-Smith, head of research at Williams de Broe. "On the one hand it is good news; on the other hand it is confirmation that we are up a gum tree." Banks were the biggest losers on the index. HSBC, BNP Paribas, UBS and Banco Santander were down 4.3-8.2 percent. Elsewhere in financials, the world's biggest listed hedge fund firm Man Group lost 35.8 percent after it said its pre-tax profit fell 24 percent to $622 million in the six months to end-September. AXA, Europe's biggest insurer by market capitalization, dropped 6.7 percent after it reported lower 9-month sales. Across Europe, the FTSE 100 index was down 3.3 percent, Germany's DAX was 4.4 percent and France's CAC 40 was 3.7 percent lower. COMMODITIES FALL, DEFENSIVES RETURN Energy stocks also contributed to heavy losses on the index as crude fell 2.9 percent as the dollar strengthened and dismal economic data pointed to a deeper U.S. recession than feared. BG Group, BP, Royal Dutch Shell and Total were down 1.4-3.2 percent. A retreat in metal prices also weighed on mining shares with  copper down 3.4 percent. Vedanta Resources slipped 9.7 percent after the group posted a 24.7 percent drop in first half profit. Rio Tinto, BHP Billiton and Xstrata were between 9.2-9.7 percent lower. On the upside, brewer InBev gained 0.9 percent as it insisted its $52 billion takeover of Anheuser-Busch was on track after third-quarter results slightly exceeded expectations despite rocketing costs. Investors also turned to defensive stocks considered a safe bet in times of economic turmoil, with the pharmaceutical sector regaining some of the ground which it lost on Wednesday. Roche and Novartis were both up around 1.4 percent. (Additional reporting by  Tyler Sitte  and Joanne Frearson; Editing by Hans Peters)
