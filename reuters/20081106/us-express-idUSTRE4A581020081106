 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Express Scripts Inc has received an extortion letter threatening to expose millions of patient records, the company said on Thursday. 

 The letter, which was sent to the pharmacy benefit manager in early October from "an unknown person or persons," contained information on 75 Express Scripts members, including names, dates of birth, social security numbers and, in some cases, prescription information. Express Scripts said it immediately notified the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which is investigating, and it notified the members named in the letter last week. The company said it is also conducting its own investigation with the help of outside experts in data security and computer forensics. Express Scripts spokesman Steve Littlejohn said the company delayed publicizing the letter to allow the investigation to take shape, but it had now reached a stage where the company wanted to make it public. CEO George Paz called the threat "outrageous" and said the company was taking it "very seriously." "We are cooperating with the FBI and are committed to doing what we can to protect our members' personal information and to track down the person or persons responsible for this criminal act," Paz said in a statement. Express Scripts said it launched a website --  www.esisupports.com  -- for members seeking information about the security incident and to access resources and information to protect themselves against possible identity theft.
