 NEW YORK/LONDON  (Reuters) - Shares in Man Group Plc, the world's largest listed hedge fund manager, tumbled on fears its clients would liquidate more funds, while private equity firm Blackstone Group LP slid after a third-quarter loss. 

 As a number of leading financial groups revealed more damage from the global financial crisis on Thursday, Man ( EMG.L ) shares slid 31 percent. Man said it had moved most assets into cash in its Man Global Strategies (MGS) product, raising fears it was preparing for an acceleration in client cash-ins. Turbulent markets forced Blackstone ( BX.N ) to lower the value of its investments, and the U.S. company turned in a third-quarter economic net loss of $509.3 million versus a year-earlier profit of $229 million. Its shares closed down 12 percent at $7.55. "It's relatively clear at this point that we're heading to a good-sized recession," Blackstone Chief Executive Stephen Schwarzman said on a conference call. "No one can predict how deep or long it will be. We can see indicators from our portfolio companies that this is happening, particularly in the U.S. and Europe." Man said MGS, which invests in other hedge funds, lost 20.3 percent of its value in the first nine months. It said assets were likely to fall by $7.5 billion by the end of the year from $8.6 billion at the end of September, as it deleverages the product. This caused the group to bring forward a $107 million amortization charge on sales commissions. "We read management's decision to accelerate amortization of upfront MGS sales commissions as an admission that outflows from MGS are expected to accelerate," analysts at Citi said. The share price fall came despite recent strong performance from its flagship AHL managed futures strategy, which is up 18.3 percent over the 12 months to November 3. Man's first-half pretax profit fell 24 percent to $622 million due to a drop in performance fees. Total funds under management fell 9 percent to $67.6 billion in the half year and dropped further to around $61 billion by the start of November, the group said. RSA UPBEAT Elsewhere, leading European banks, insurers and asset managers reported weak results, though U.K. commercial insurer RSA Insurance Group PLC ( RSA.L ) maintained a more upbeat tone in reporting an 11 percent rise in premium income. AXA SA ( AXAF.PA ), Europe's biggest insurer by market value, posted a 0.9 percent fall in sales in the first nine months of the year, with revenue affected by outflows at its asset management division due to the market turmoil. While AXA managed to stay profitable, other European insurers could not avoid losses due to the turmoil. Dutch Aegon NV ( AEGN.AS ) suffered a third-quarter net loss of 329 million euros, while Belgian financial group KBC Groep NV ( KBC.BR ) made a loss of 906 million euros. Austrian bank Raiffeisen International Bank Holding AG RIBH.VI was forced to cut its 2008 net profit forecast by 5 percent despite a better-than-expected 32 percent rise in third-quarter net profit. Banks and insurers across the globe have been hit by the worst financial crisis in about 80 years, which began when U.S. homeowners started to default on their loans. However, AXA remained upbeat over its prospects and said it could handle the crisis due to its "strong underlying profitability and cash flows." "We expect to come out of the current turmoil stronger and better positioned," CEO Henri de Castries said. Britain's RSA posted an 11 percent rise in premiums for the first nine months to 4.9 billion pounds ($7.8 billion) and reiterated that it expects to achieve a combined ratio -- costs and claims as a percentage of premiums -- of better than 95 percent this year. Meanwhile, Henderson Group Plc ( HGGH.L ) said assets under management fell 3 percent in the three months to end-September, sending its shares down 5.5 percent. And private equity investor 3i Plc ( III.L ) said it expected a more challenging second half as the credit squeeze and economic downturn continues to reduce portfolio earnings and dampen M&A activity. Its shares slid 13 percent. Despite shell-shocked financial markets, investors continued to look for places to put their money, and both Man and Henderson saw solid net new asset inflows. At Man, client inflows were up 17 percent as institutions continued to invest in funds, while Henderson said net inflows were 800 million pounds. 3i sees opportunities in the wake of the credit crunch. "We have on the buyouts side some evidence of being able to access debt where there have been good quality buyouts to be done," said CEO Philip Yea.
