 LONDON  (Reuters) - The Bank of England slashed interest rates by 1.5 percentage points to 3 percent on Thursday as policymakers act to ward off a deep recession. 

 Following are reactions from business groups and economists to the decision. WILLEM BUITER, FORMER MPC MEMBER, PROFESSOR AT LONDON SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS "I think it is wonderful. We obviously underestimated their willingness to do something radically different from what they have ever done before. I probably should have given them more credit, because these are unprecedented circumstances, so an unprecedented response." "I could have written some of that (statement) myself. I tend to find myself an outlier in this debate, and to find that I am part of the consensus is surprising, it's very good." MICHAEL COOGAN, DIRECTOR-GENERAL, COUNCIL OF MORTGAGE  LENDERS "It's very good news for consumer confidence. It shows the Monetary Policy Committee grasping the nettle, which they needed to do." "I hope that then starts to feed through to the interbank lending numbers, so that they can be fed through into both mortgage saving reductions and improvement in the economy as a whole." "Half of mortgage customers are on fixed rates, so (the rate cut) isn't affecting them. "Around 40 percent are on tracker rates, and they will get the benefit. And we have around 10 percent on standard variable rate, and the question is: will they get the full benefit or a partial benefit?" SHAMIK DHAR, DIRECTOR, FATHOM CONSULTING "Rarely have all these economic ducks lined up in one direction quite so dramatically. I think what we've seen is the bank return to its activist roots. This is the kind of decision that I think the first MPC would have taken. "It's good to see the bank gets the problem. I think we're going to see inflation fall dramatically. I've always thought rates will come down to two percent by the middle of next year and I think the risks to that are now well on the down side. "The possibility of rates getting to zero or thereabouts is significant now." JAMES KNIGHTLEY, ECONOMIST, ING FINANCIAL MARKETS "The UK has been living beyond its means for too long and a prolonged period of pain is inevitable. We forecast that the economy will contract by 1.7 percent in 2009 with inflation set to fall sharply as lower energy costs feed through and weak activity constrains corporate pricing power. "With corporate profits set to plunge, firms will be looking to cut costs. This points to a surge in unemployment, which will dampen inflation expectations and provide room for further monetary policy easing. We continue to look for additional aggressive rate cuts from the Bank of England and suspect we could be down to 2.5 percent in December and 2 percent in January." GRAEME LEACH, CHIEF ECONOMIST AT THE INSTITUTE OF DIRECTORS "This is a bold and aggressive move by the MPC and just what the economy needs. The household savings ratio is close to zero and could spike upwards, business investment intentions have fallen off a cliff and the banks are unlikely to pass on the reduction in full. "A 150 basis point reduction shows that the MPC think inflation is yesterday's story and deflation is the risk for tomorrow. We think interest rates could touch record lows of 2 per cent or less by this time next year. The sooner we get interest rates down the less is the risk of a long and deep recession." HOWARD ARCHER, ECONOMIST, GLOBAL INSIGHT "The fact that the Bank of England had never previously moved interest rates by more than 50 basis points in any direction since the Monetary Policy Committee was set up in 1997 highlights the very serious situation that the UK economy is in. On top of the very clear evidence that the economic downturn is deepening, credit conditions remain uncomfortably tight." ROSS BOWEN, MANAGING DIRECTOR OF CONNELLS SURVEY & VALUATION "It's now crucial that lenders pass this unprecedented 1.5 percent rate cut onto borrowers. "Consumers must see the benefit of looser monetary policy if we're to avoid the worst ravages of recession. The government and authorities cannot relax now -- the health of our whole economy depends on it." STUART PORTEOUS, HEAD OF RBS GROUP ECONOMICS "Extraordinary times require extraordinary actions. Today's rate cut is unprecedented in the history of the MPC. Markets were crying out for something bold and the MPC has delivered. The slowdown in the real economy is accelerating and I expect rates to fall toward 2 percent. It now looks like we'll get there sooner rather than later." MATTHEW SHARRATT, UK ECONOMIST, BANK OF AMERICA "It was an astonishing 150 basis point cut. It really showed the Bank of England stepping up to the plate in the context of truly serious slowdown in economic activity." "We continue to expect that there is going to be further easing from the Bank of England. The door is still firmly open to substantial easing. We continue to look for 2 percent in the bank rate during the first quarter. But after today's decision I think the chances are very much growing that they could take the bank rate down even below 2 percent during the second quarter of next year." ADAM LENT, HEAD OF ECONOMICS, TRADES UNION CONGRESS "This is the right call. It shows the Bank now understands that the problem is recession not inflation. This cut was precisely in line with the TUC's call. "But the real challenge is to ensure that these cuts are passed on to both business and mortgage customers. Too many banks seem to be more interested in hanging on to their bonuses than using the huge bail out from the taxpayer for its proper purpose of getting the economy moving again. Unless the cost of credit comes down, there will be many avoidable job losses in sound businesses." DAVID PAGE, CHIEF ECONOMIST, INVESTEC "This is a stunning move by the bank. It shows just how seriously the UK authorities are taking the economic situation. "The MPC is clearly trying to ensure that the depth and the scale of the recession are limited. "There would be very few in the markets who would have expected a move on this scale. "There's relatively little in the statement that points to where we might be going forward. The experience of the Federal Reserve suggests the central bank could keep cutting." JONATHAN LOYNES, CAPITAL ECONOMICS "It's a spectacular move but there is still more to do. At 3 percent, UK interest rates are still well above U.S. ones when economic conditions suggest they should be as low if not lower. "Our view remains that UK rates will fall to 1 percent or below." RICHARD LAMBERT, DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE CONFEDERATION OF BRITISH INDUSTRY "The Bank clearly felt the need to get ahead of the curve and make what is a very bold and decisive step. "They have never cut by more than half a point before. They like to move in short stages. They have clearly decided rates are coming down fast, we might as well get on with it, and that's a good thing." AMIT KARA, UK ECONOMIST AT UBS "It's clear that the MPC believed that the level of interest rates was way wrong at 4.5 percent. In our view there will be more rate cuts. We're looking for rates at 2 percent. "It's clear that the MPC did not want to disappoint markets. There has clearly been a reassessment of the situation."
