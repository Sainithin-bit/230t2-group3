 BRUSSELS/NEW YORK  (Reuters) - World number-two brewer InBev said on Thursday its $52 billion takeover of Anheuser-Busch was on track and that third-quarter results slightly exceeded market expectations despite rocketing costs. 

 Also on Thursday, Budweiser-maker Anheuser reported quarterly profit in line with Wall Street's view and claimed a gain of market share on the strength of sales of Bud Light Lime. Belgium's InBev, the brewer of Stella Artois and Beck's, said it was on course to close the purchase by the end of the year in the face of market turmoil that forced the postponement of a $9.8 billion rights issue last month. Chief Financial Officer Felipe Dutra told a conference call the deal to buy the maker of Budweiser, agreed in July before the financial crisis deepened, was simply awaiting approval by Anheuser shareholders on November 12, and by regulators. "I firmly believe the deal will be closed based on the agreed-upon conditions," he said. "The rights issue will be executed as part of the capital structure of the transaction," he said, adding the delay was the result of volatility rather than price or demand. Chief Executive Carlos Brito told a later conference call that InBev had earmarked five non-core assets for possible sale, and might reach a $7 billion divestment target by selling two or three. Consolidation has increased elsewhere in the sector over the past 24 hours as Molson Coors Brewing Co emerged as the holder of a 5 percent stake in Australia's Foster's. InBev said EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) rose 6.5 percent on a like-for-like basis to 1.39 billion euros ($1.79 billion) in the July-September period, from 1.33 billion a year earlier. A Reuters poll of eight analysts had produced a consensus of 1.37 billion. InBev shares rose as much as 6.1 percent in early trade, making them the strongest in the FTSE Eurotop 300, but eased back to 29.37 euros, a gain of 0.8 percent, at 10:40 a.m. EDT. This followed Wednesday's 13.5 percent fall after Danish rival Carlsberg trimmed its full-year earnings outlook due to weaker consumer sentiment. Some analysts saw Thursday's initial gain as a relief rally. "The numbers are broadly in line. The shares were really badly hit yesterday," said Wim Hoste, analyst at KBC Securities. Anheuser shares ticked up 0.1 percent to $63.68, still below InBev's $70 a share offer price. LOWER GROWTH, INFLATION IN 2009 InBev, set to take back the spot as number-one brewer from SABMiller Plc when it buys Anheuser, said cost of sales per hectolitre accelerated to 9.9 percent in the third quarter, but should decelerate significantly in the final quarter. For the full year, the figure should be "moderately" above the upper end of its previous expectation of 5 to 6 percent. "In 2009, cost of sales could favor us, partly offsetting lower volume growth," CFO Dutra said, adding he saw volume expansion similar to the 2008 level of 2 percent to 3 percent, down on 2007's increase of 5.2 percent. Revenue increased by a like-for-like 7.7 percent to 3.95 billion euros, against analyst expectations of 3.92 billion euros, and normalized net profit rose 3.8 percent to 542 million euros. Analysts had on average forecast 537 million euros. InBev had in October forecast high single-digit sales growth. Eastern Europe was the clear underperformer, with declining volumes and increased marketing expenses in Russia. Anheuser, which also brews Michelob, reported net income fell 5.7 percent to $666.1 million, or $0.90 per share. However, ignoring one-offs including charges related to the InBev deal, it earned $1.05 per share, exactly in line with expectations. The company reported last month that U.S. quarterly beer volumes rose by 2.3 percent and sales from wholesalers to retailers by 3.6 percent, in what one analyst said were the strongest sales results since 2000.
