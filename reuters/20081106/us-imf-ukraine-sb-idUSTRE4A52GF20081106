 WASHINGTON/KIEV  (Reuters) - The IMF approved a $16.5 billion loan program for Ukraine to ease strains from the global financial crisis and officials expressed confidence on Thursday that the country was out of the woods. 

 The International Monetary Fund, in a statement issued late on Wednesday, said it would immediately disburse $4.5 billion to the government under the two-year loan agreement. "The authorities' programme is designed to help stabilize the domestic financial system against a backdrop of global deleveraging and a domestic crisis of confidence, and to facilitate adjustment of the economy to a large terms-of-trade shock," the Fund said. "The authorities' plan incorporates monetary and exchange rate policy shifts, banking recapitalization, and fiscal and incomes policy adjustments." In Kiev, President Viktor Yushchenko welcomed the decision, taken after Ukraine's fractious parliament approved enabling legislation. He said it provided a "signal to the international community to boost the rating of trust in our country." Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, the president's former ally turned rival, said the loan would "allow us to stabilize completely the financial situation in Ukraine." The head of the central bank's policy-making council later said it was the bank's open-ended intervention that stabilized the hryvnia currency after it hit a historic low last week. Daily intervention of up to $500 million, Petro Poroshenko said, had reduced demand for dollars and restored stability. "Exports had earlier held foreign currency in anticipation of a higher (dollar) rate and dealers had earlier tried to make money on working the rates. But today we have a significantly reduced scope for speculative operations," he told reporters. Poroshenko also said subsequent tranches of the IMF loan would depend on whether authorities formally requested them. Disbursement of parts of IMF credits is generally linked to further review of conditions in the country receiving the funds. RECESSION FORECAST The IMF decision was issued along with forecast indicators predicting that Ukraine would sink into recession next year, with a 3 percent fall against 6 percent growth this year. In a statement, Murilo Portugal, IMF deputy managing director, said Ukraine's economy, especially its banking system, was under severe stress, caused by a drop in global steel prices, the country's main export, and global financial turmoil. He said Ukraine's programme would seek to restore financial and economic stability through a more flexible exchange rate regime with targeted interventions, so-called 'pre-emptive' recapitalization of banks, and tighter monetary policy. "The flexible exchange rate regime, backed by an appropriate monetary policy and foreign exchange intervention, will help absorb external shocks and avoid disorderly exchange market developments," Portugal said. "The recent unification of official and market exchange rates should increase clarity about the regime." Exchange controls recently imposed, he said, would be phased out as confidence returns to the economy. Ukraine's central bank has been intervening since early October to bolster the hryvnia currency. It began offering buy-sell rates for currencies this week after previously only selling or buying a currency. Portugal said as credit pressures abate, tighter monetary policy will be needed to guard against inflation. He said the government's target of a balanced 2009 budget would be reviewed, although it could be achieved through expenditure restraint and a phased increase in energy tariffs. Portugal said recapitalization efforts for banks would ease liquidity pressures that could prolong an economic downturn. "Decisive measures that have been taken to allocate public funds to recapitalize banks and to facilitate bank resolution processes will ensure that problems can be dealt with promptly," he said.
