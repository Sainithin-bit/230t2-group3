 LONDON  (Reuters) - The Bank of England made a shock 1-1/2 percentage point cut in interest rates on Thursday to just 3 percent, their lowest level in more than half a century, as it seeks to prevent Britain from sliding into a deep recession. 

 That was the biggest official interest rate cut since the 1981 slump and completely wrong-footed analysts who had mostly been predicting a half-point reduction. Not one in 62 polled by Reuters had expected such a massive move. The BoE said the economic outlook had got a lot worse and drastic action was now needed. Economists said more rate cuts would still follow and it was possible Britain could soon have rates the same level as in the United States -- one percent. "The MPC needs to keep cutting interest rates aggressively. I think that they will need to fall to 1 percent," said Roger Bootle, economic adviser to Deloitte. "Rates have never before been this low, but extraordinary times require extraordinary action. And it is not impossible to imagine circumstances under which rates end up having to go lower, perhaps even to zero as they have done in Japan." Two-year bond yields fell to a record low below 2.5 percent. The pound, already down about 20 percent this year, fell but then rose after the rate verdict as investors bet the economy's growth prospects had improved. The British economy shrank for the first time in 16 years in the third quarter and most economists expect further contraction through next year and only a small recovery in 2010, when Prime Minister Gordon Brown must call an election. COORDINATED CUTS? The Swiss National Bank and European Central Bank also cut interest rates on Thursday as countries all around the globe try and cope with the fallout from the credit crisis that has felled some of the biggest financial institutions around the world. "It is welcome that we are having co-ordinated cuts," said Treasury Minister Yvette Cooper shortly after the moves. Thursday's stunning BoE move follows a globally co-ordinated emergency rate cut of half a percentage point last month, meaning British rates have come down by nearly three percentage points since last December. While some praised the latest BoE decision as courageous, others wondered why Governor Mervyn King, who often says he wants monetary policy to be boring, had taken so long. One BoE policymaker David Blanchflower had been calling for rates cuts for most of this year but the majority of the Monetary Policy Committee had been fixated on inflation running significantly above the central bank's 2 percent target. The economy, meanwhile, has been slowing sharply. House prices started sliding a year ago as the supply of new mortgages has all but dried up in the wake of the credit crunch. The average British home now costs 15 percent less than it did a year ago, according to the country's largest mortgage lender, raising the prospect of hundreds of thousands falling into negative equity -- their home worth less than their debt. Consumer spending has also been taking a battering as Britons deal with not only the credit crunch but also huge rises in petrol prices and household bills over the last year. Britain's biggest clothing retailer Marks and Spencer Group Plc said this week that its profits had slumped by a third as sentiment was being hit by the events in markets. The BoE rate cut could boost morale. Thursday's rate cut, if passed on in full, would reduce the monthly repayment on a 250,000 pound 25-year mortgage by 225 pounds, according to the Council of Mortgage Lenders. Petrol prices have also fallen sharply, providing another boost to stretched household incomes and the government is hoping this should provide enough of an impetus for recovery next year. Experts are not so sure, particularly as the credit squeeze means lenders are reluctant to pass on rate cuts in full despite exhortations by the prime minister. The BoE will publish its updated forecasts for the economy next week. "The UK has been living beyond its means for too long and a prolonged period of pain is inevitable," said James Knightley, economist at ING. "We forecast the economy will contract by 1.7 percent in 2009 with inflation set to fall sharply lower as lower energy costs feed through and weak activity constrains the corporate pricing power."
