 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc forecast fiscal first-quarter and full-year earnings will be far below Wall Street estimates, indicating that the economic crisis could have a prolonged impact on cell phone demand. 

 Chief Executive Paul Jacobs said problems arising from the credit crunch would likely last a few more quarters, and shares of Qualcomm, which supplies wireless chips and technology licenses, fell 3.5 percent. Qualcomm forecast fiscal 2009 revenue at $10.2 billion to $10.8 billion, compared with the average analyst forecast of $12.1 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. It saw pro forma earnings for the year that began on September 29 at between $2.00 and $2.10 per share, far below the average Wall Street forecast of $2.56. "While we continue to see strong growth in 3G CDMA, the current macroeconomic conditions and potential for further economic slowdown creates an uncertain business environment for the next few quarters," Jacobs said in a statement. "As a result of the credit crisis and the economic uncertainty, our guidance reflects slower end-market device growth for 2009 than previously anticipated and a significant contraction in channel inventory in the first and second fiscal quarters." Qualcomm forecast first-quarter pro forma earnings per share, before items such as its investment arm, of 46 cents to 50 cents, on revenue of $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion. Analysts on average had expected first-quarter earnings of 61 cents a share on revenue of $2.9 billion. The poor outlook overshadowed quarterly earnings that beat Wall Street expectations. For the fourth quarter ended September 28, Qualcomm posted a net profit of $878 million, or 52 cents a share, down 22 percent from a year earlier. Excluding items, Qualcomm said its profit was 63 cents per share. Analysts, on average, had forecast 60 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Quarterly revenue rose 45 percent to $3.3 billion. Qualcomm said it was helped by a previously announced technology licensing agreement with leading mobile phone maker Nokia, a move that settled their long-standing legal battles. Shares of Qualcomm fell to $31.91 in extended trading, after closing down 6.03 percent at $33.05 on Nasdaq. (Reporting by  Ritsuko Ando , editing by Richard Chang)
