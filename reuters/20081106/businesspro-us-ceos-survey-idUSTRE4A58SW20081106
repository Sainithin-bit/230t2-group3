 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. chief executives have abruptly lost confidence in business and economic conditions and about jobs, according to a monthly index that posted its biggest-ever drop in October. 

 The CEO Confidence Index fell 42 points to 58.2 last month, a record low, Chief Executive magazine said on Thursday. The index had registered gains in confidence in August and September. Measures of both current and future business conditions also plummeted in October, and the survey's employment confidence indexes reached record lows. More than two-thirds of CEOs expect employment to fall over the next quarter, according to the survey, suggesting the U.S. unemployment rate could reach 8 percent in coming months, compared with 6.1 percent in the most recent reading. The government will release October jobs data on Friday. "We have never seen confidence drop so sharply and dramatically during one polling cycle," said publisher Ed Kopko. About 300 business executives from both private and public companies responded to the magazine's survey, which dates back to October 2002. (Reporting by Nick Zieminski, editing by Dave Zimmerman)
