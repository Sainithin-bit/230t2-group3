 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Thursday it is very difficult to see when the business environment will stabilize amid the global crisis. 

 "Frankly it's very difficult to determine when the environment will stabilize," Executive Vice President Mitsuo Kinoshita told a news conference, adding that Toyota had folded in tough exchange rate and sales assumptions into its latest forecasts. (Reporting by  Chang-Ran Kim )
