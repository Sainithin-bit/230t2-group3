 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Top U.S. toymaker Mattel Inc announced on Thursday it was cutting about 1,000 jobs, saying the global economy had entered "one of its most challenging and difficult periods in the last 100 years." 

 The job cuts come less than a month before the holiday sales season, which is expected to be one of the worst in up to 20 years. Mattel said the 1,000 positions, which represent about 3 percent of its total workforce, would be eliminated through layoffs, freezing open positions, attrition and retirement. The company, known for toy brands such as Barbie and Elmo, had already posted disappointing third-quarter results in October, At that time, its Chief Executive Bob Eckert said, "we're experiencing what is likely the worst economic crisis of my generation." On Thursday, Mattel said the current economic environment had heightened its need to address the future structure of its business, which included streamlining its workforce. Wedbush Morgan Securities analyst Chris White said it was the timing of the announcement and not so much the job cuts, which was surprising. "The fact that any company right now would announce jobs is not surprising," White said. "But the largest toy company, maybe two weeks before Black Friday announcing it? A little surprising." Its shares, which were down almost 3 percent, would have fallen lower if not for dismal October same-store sales results from U.S. retailers which was keeping investors focused on those stocks, White said. Mattel shares closed down 46 cents at $14.52 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by  Aarthi Sivaraman ; Editing by  Andre Grenon )
