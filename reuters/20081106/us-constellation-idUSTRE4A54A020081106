 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Constellation Energy CEG.N on Thursday said third-quarter operating profit tumbled due to poor results from its merchant business, which was hit by poor results from its energy trading business. 

 Excluding items, the company posted quarterly earnings of 76 cents a share, down from a year-ago profit of $1.45 a share. The company posted a net loss of $225.7 million, or 1.27 a share, compared with a year-ago profit of $251.4 million, or $1.38 a share. In September, Constellation Energy agreed to sell itself to MidAmerican, a unit of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc ( BRKa.N ), ( BRKb.N ) for about $4.7 billion in cash as mounting fears about its liquidity cut its value by nearly 60 percent. In a bid to increase liquidity, the company had said it would sell its upstream gas assets and international coal and freight businesses. Constellation said it now also intends to sell its Houston-based downstream gas trading operations. (Reporting by  Euan Rocha , editing by Maureen Bavdek)
