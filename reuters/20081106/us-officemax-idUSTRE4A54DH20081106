 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - OfficeMax Inc OMX.N reported a large quarterly loss on Thursday due to a charge from a note backed by failed investment bank Lehman Brothers, but the office supplies retailer beat Wall Street expectations. 

 OfficeMax and rivals like Office Depot ( ODP.N ) have been hit as small business owners cut spending in a weak U.S. economy. OfficeMax said it expects "significant sales declines" due to the economy and a weak holiday sales season. The company forecast increased deleveraging of costs and expenses in its fourth quarter compared to the first nine months of the year. OfficeMax reported a third-quarter net loss of $432.7 million, or $5.70 per share, compared with a profit of $48.9 million, or 64 cents per share, a year earlier. The quarter included a charge of $735.8 million for impairment of a Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEHMQ.PK guaranteed installment note, as well as a charge of $18.2 million for interest receivable related to the note. Adjusted for the charges, the company earned $28 million, or 36 cents per share. On that basis, analysts had expected 34 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales fell 9.5 percent to $2.096 billion, lower than the $2.13 billion expected by analysts. In September, OfficeMax said a unit's $835 million in securitization notes were in default because of guarantor Lehman's bankruptcy. The guaranteed installment note was issued in connection with the 2004 sale of timberlands. Sales in OfficeMax's retail and contract divisions fell 7.3 percent and 11.5 percent, respectively. The retailer said sales in both divisions trended in the negative low-double-digit range in October and it expects negative sales trends for the rest of the year. Last week Staples ( SPLS.O ), the world's largest office products retailer, said third-quarter adjusted profit would top Wall Street estimates and backed its long-term financial expectations. That contrasted with Office Depot, which posted a surprising quarterly loss and said it would delay new store openings in the weak U.S. economy. U.S. office furniture shipments fell 1 percent in September to $985 million, the lowest growth rate since September 2004, according to the Business and Institutional Furniture Manufacturers Association. Shares of OfficeMax closed at $5.57 Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange and were inactive premarket on Thursday. The stock has lost more than 89 percent of its value over the past 52 weeks.
