 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - DVD rental company Blockbuster Inc posted a narrower third-quarter loss on Thursday, helped by the addition of more consumer products and cost reductions at its stores. 

 Blockbuster said last month it was comfortable with analysts' third-quarter estimates and repeated its full-year forecasts. Third-quarter revenues fell 2.7 percent, reflecting the closure of dozens of stores from the year earlier, to $1.2 billion from $1.24 billion. Net loss for the quarter narrowed 48.3 percent to $17.8 million, or 11 cents per share, from a net loss of $34.4 million, or 20 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company posted a loss of 8 cents, which was better than analysts' consensus forecasts of a loss of 15 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. "They're right on track. It was a good report. When you look at the top line, they're operating fewer stores, but they're making more money on a per store basis," said Stern Agee analyst Arvind Bhatia. The company's shares were up slightly higher in thin, volatile after-hours trade to about $1.39 a share after closing down 23 cents at $1.32 a share on the New York Stock Exchange.
