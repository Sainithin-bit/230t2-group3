 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President George W. Bush said on Thursday the United States faces economic challenges that "will not pause" to let a new president settle into the job, as he promised to work for an orderly transfer of power to Democrat Barack Obama. 

 "Ensuring that this transition is as smooth as possible is a priority for the rest of my presidency," Bush told more than a thousand federal employees at the White House. "We face economic challenges that will not pause to let a new president settle in," Bush said, referring to the economic and financial crisis that has roiled world markets. (Editing by  Sandra Maler )
