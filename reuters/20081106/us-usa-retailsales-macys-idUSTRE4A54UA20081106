 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Department store operator Macy's Inc., parent of Macy's and Bloomingdale's chains, on Thursday reported a 6.3 percent drop in October sales at stores open at least one full fiscal year. 

 The company, which decided in late October to reinstate monthly same-store sales reports, also reiterated its second-half comparable store forecast on Thursday. Cincinnati-based Macy's said total sales were $1.72 billion for the four weeks ended November 1, down 6.9 percent from the year-ago period. Macy's said third-quarter total sales were $5.5 billion, above analysts' expectations of $5.487 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Third-quarter comparable store sales were down 6 percent, the company said. Macy's reiterated a previous forecast of a same-store sales drop of 3 percent to 6 percent in its fall season, which it defines as the period from August to January and includes the critical holiday shopping season. The department store said it expects its fourth-quarter same-store sales to be down 1 percent to 6 percent, and November comparable-store sales to fall in the low-double digits, in part the result of a calendar shift that moves a week of sales into the December period. In October, Macy's slashed its full-year profit forecast and warned that sales could fall sharply in the back half of its fiscal year. For months, U.S. consumers have avoided shopping at department stores as rising food and fuel prices pressure household budgets also hurt by the housing market slump, job losses and a credit crunch.
