 RANCHI, India  (Reuters) - Hundreds of tribal people beat drums, fired crackers and distributed sweets in eastern India Thursday to celebrate Barack Obama's victory as the first black U.S. president-elect. 

 Tribals are among the poorest and most backward sections of Indian society and say they suffer racial discrimination in a country enjoying an economic boom in some areas. When news of Obama's triumph reached the state capital of Jharkhand, hundreds in traditional tribal dress thronged to a statue of Mahatma Gandhi, dancing and shouting slogans of optimism. "The victory of Obama in U.S. election is indication that racial discrimination will end in all forms," Ajay Tirkey, the president of a tribal organization said. "This is a historical moment of the world that a black has been elected to president of most powerful country of the world. We hope even India will soon get a black president."
