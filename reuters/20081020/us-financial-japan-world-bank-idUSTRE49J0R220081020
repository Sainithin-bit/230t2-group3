 TOKYO  (Reuters) - The World Bank's top economist said on Monday that central banks across the globe should pay closer attention not only to consumer prices but also to real estate and stock prices to prevent the recurrence of the financial crisis. 

 "Monetary policy should not target only CPI (consumer price index), but should include equity and asset prices," World Bank Chief Economist Justin Yifu Lin said in a briefing on the impact of the financial crisis on developing countries and lessons from the recent credit crunch. Lin said he appreciated the recent slew of coordinated policy actions by industrialized nations aimed at containing the financial crisis. "Responses to global crisis must be systematic, comprehensive, decisive and coordinated," he added. Central banks in industrialized nations launched last month a joint dollar-funding facility, while some of them also coordinated simultaneous rate cuts as they sought to contain the spread of the credit crunch. In addition, central bank chiefs and financial ministers from the G8 have agreed recently to conduct public fund injections into the financial sector, hit hard by the credit meltdown. Lin also stressed the need for developing countries hurt by the financial market turmoil to adopt an expansionary fiscal policy and monetary easing to overcome the credit crunch and slowdown in the global economy. He said that with an expansionary fiscal policy aimed at boosting domestic demand and monetary easing, China, for instance, "can easily maintain 8 to 9 percent growth."
