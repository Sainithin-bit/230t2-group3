 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Top U.S. toy company Mattel Inc MAT.N posted a slightly higher third-quarter profit on Monday, helped by increased sales of some Fisher-Price and American Girl products. 

 The owner of Barbie and Hot Wheels posted net profit of $238.1 million, or 66 cents per share, compared with $236.8 million, or 61 cents per share, a year earlier. Sales rose 6 percent to $1.95 billion, with currency benefits accounting for 2 percentage points of the gain. Sales rose 7 percent internationally and increased 4 percent in the United States. Worldwide gross sales for Barbie fell 1 percent as declines overseas offset modest domestic growth, Mattel said. (Reporting by  Aarthi Sivaraman ; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
