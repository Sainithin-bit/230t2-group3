 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Australia's central bank may not cut interest rates as aggressively as many hope, media reports suggest, given the government and commercial banks are injecting stimulus of their own. 

 Expectations of another big rate cut from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) were also dented by a record rise in producer prices, reported on Monday, which deepened already hefty losses for bill futures. "The market got ahead of itself and now it's coming back to earth," said Brian Redican, a senior economist at Macquarie. "We still think the RBA will cut further, just not in a rush." The central bank stunned investors early this month by cutting its key cash rate 100 basis points to 6.0 percent, the biggest easing in 16 years. With financial markets in turmoil and a global recession looming, bill futures had been pricing in a further easing of at least 75 basis points at the RBA's next policy meeting on Nov 4. That had now been scaled back to 50 basis points. Analysts cited a report from columnist Terry McCrann in the Australian newspaper over the weekend that the government's sudden announcement last week of a A$10.4 billion ($7.2 billion) stimulus plan had lessened the need for more steep rate cuts. "Whatever official rate cut it was planning to deliver, it will now be less. Potentially, reduced all the way to zero. No rate cut," wrote McCrann, who has become influential in markets after correctly tipping easings in October and September. The fiscal plan is equal to almost 1 percent of gross domestic product and much of that will come before Christmas. "The package certainly does make it much less likely that we get further aggressive RBA easing given the fiscal stimulus is equivalent to a few rate cuts," said Adam Carr, a senior economist at broker ICAP. PRICE PRESSURE Inflation pressures were also proving stubborn. Government data out on Monday showed producer prices jumped 2.0 percent in the third quarter, twice what analysts expected and the biggest rise since the series began in 1998. That would squeeze profit margins and add to already high consumer prices. The consumer price index (CPI) for the third quarter is due out on Wednesday and expected to rise 1.0 percent, taking annual inflation to 4.7 percent, from 4.5 percent in the second quarter. The RBA's key measures of core inflation are also seen rising by 1.0 percent, leaving the annual pace around 17-year highs of 4.4 percent and well above its target of 2 to 3 percent. Adding to the case for being cautious on further easing was independent cuts from three of Australia's major banks. Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, National Australia Bank and Commonwealth Bank of Australia have all cut their variable mortgage rates by between 20 and 25 basis points since Friday. One reason the central bank cut by so much in October was to ease funding pressures in the banking system which were threatening to actually push mortgage rates higher. "Yes, funding pressures have eased a bit, but they remain intense," said Carr, noting bank bill swap rates were still prohibitively far above expected official rates. "If you take away rate cut expectations, I think the logical move would be a spike in bank bill rates, so it wouldn't pay in this environment for the RBA to deliver nothing," he argued. For that reason, he still expected the central bank to ease by 50 basis points at its November 4 policy meeting. (Reporting by Wayne Cole; Editing by  Mark Bendeich )
