 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - American International Group Inc ( AIG.N ) will cut its lobbying activities after questions from Capitol Hill over the use of a $120 billion federal bailout, a company spokesman was quoted as saying. 

 The Wall Street Journal, on its website on Monday, reported the insurer will also reduce events it had planned for the coming months to cut costs by about $80 million, citing the spokesman Nick Ashooh. He was not immediately available to confirm the comments. "We're reviewing all of our expenses and activities. As part of that we have suspended lobbying activities," Ashooh told the Journal. The company will keep lobbying offices open but reduce staffing, according to the report. Rep. Henry Waxman, chair of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, wrote to AIG Chief Executive Edward Liddy last week asking for details on how the company has used the $123 billion it has received from the government so far. AIG asked the government to come to its aid last month after large losses on mortgage-linked investments left the giant insurer on the verge of bankruptcy. The company is in the midst of selling off assets to try and pay off the federal loan. (Reporting by  Lilla Zuill ; editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)
