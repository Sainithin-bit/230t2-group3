 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of NRG Energy Inc ( NRG.N ) jumped more than 24 percent to $24 before the bell on Monday after Exelon Corp ( EXC.N ), the largest nuclear power operator in the United States, made an unsolicited offer to buy NRG. 

 The shares are still trading below what they would be worth under Exelon's deal. Exelon offered to pay a fixed exchange ratio of 0.485 Exelon shares for each NRG share, equal to about $26.43 a share based on Friday's closing prices. Exelon shares slipped 2.7 percent to $53.04 in premarket trade. Buying NRG, an independent power producer, would expand Exelon's unregulated energy business. The combined company would be the No. 1 U.S. power company, with generating capacity of around 47,000 megawatts, or enough electricity to serve nearly 45 million homes, according to Exelon.
