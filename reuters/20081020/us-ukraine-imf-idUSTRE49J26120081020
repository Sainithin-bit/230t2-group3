 KIEV  (Reuters) - Ukraine's Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko expressed confidence on Monday that talks with the International Monetary Fund would prove successful and that the country would secure "substantial" financial assistance. 

 A statement on the government Web site said Tymoshenko had held a new round of talks on Monday morning with an IMF mission in Kiev since last week. "Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko stressed that the talks would come to a successful conclusion and that it was very likely Ukraine would receive substantial financial assistance," the statement said. Ukrainian officials, after launching talks with the IMF last week, said the Fund was prepared to provide up to $14 billion to help stabilize the country's financial system. Ukraine has suffered limited effects from the world wide financial crisis, but its hryvnia currency has weakened and the central bank has plowed new sums into banks for refinancing. Other countries, like Hungary, Iceland and Serbia, are also seeking help to find remedies to jolts sustained from the world financial crisis. Fund officials have offered no comment on their talks in Ukraine. The ex-Soviet state is plagued by constant political turbulence and faces its third parliamentary election in as many years in December after the breakup of a ruling coalition linked to the 2004 pro-Western "Orange Revolution." IMF officials met Tymoshenko and President Viktor Yushchenko, her political rival, on Friday, and a presidential adviser said two to three weeks were needed to clinch an agreement on a credit facility of $10-14 billion. As the mission proceeded, ratings agency Fitch downgraded Ukraine's credit rating to B+. The cost of insuring Ukraine's debt against restructuring or default rose sharply on Friday to a mid-price of 2,000 points -- meaning it costs $2 million a year over five years to insure $10 million of debt.
