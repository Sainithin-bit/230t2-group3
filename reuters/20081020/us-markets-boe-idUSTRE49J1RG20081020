 LONDON  (Reuters) - The Bank of England acted to make it easier for commercial banks to get short-term funding on Monday, introducing new facilities promised last week to allow banks to borrow overnight and for up to a month. 

 Bank of England Governor Mervyn King said on October 16 that the reforms would help provide certainty to banks looking for financing at a time when commercial money markets were not functioning normally. In the overnight lending facility, banks can borrow from the BoE at a rate 25 basis points above the BoE's benchmark interest rate, currently 4.5 percent. "The purpose of the Operational Standing Facilities is to stabilize expectations that overnight market interest rates will be in line with Bank Rate; and, to that end, to give banks a means to manage unexpected 'frictional' payments shocks," the BoE said on its website. The BoE is ceasing publication of daily borrowing, because that had caused banks to avoid the BoE's previous overnight lending facility for fear that other lenders would see they were short of cash. The so-called discount window facility (DWF) allows banks to borrow British government bonds for up to 30 days against collateral. "The purpose of the DWF is to provide liquidity insurance to the banking system. The Discount Window Facility is not intended for firms facing fundamental problems of solvency or viability," the BoE said. The BoE added it would continue to review its collateral rules in consultation with financial markets. * For the BoE statement, see  here * For coverage of the plans' announcement on October 16, and similar measures by other central banks, go to
