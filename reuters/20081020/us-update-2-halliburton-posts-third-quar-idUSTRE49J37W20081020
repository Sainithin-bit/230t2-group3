 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Halliburton Co ( HAL.N ) posted a quarterly net loss on Monday, hurt by an acquisition-related charge and costs from the cash settlement of a convertible senior notes premium. 

 The third-quarter net loss was $21 million, or 2 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $727 million, or 79 cents a share. Excluding items, the company posted earnings of 76 cents a share. Analysts on average had expected profit of 74 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Additionally, Halliburton said the hurricanes that hit the Gulf of Mexico had hurt results by 4 cents a share. Quarterly revenue rose 23.5 percent to $4.85 billion, exceeding analysts' estimates of $4.62 billion. Halliburton and rivals offering equipment and technology to help energy companies produce oil and gas have been hit hard as the economic slowdown depresses energy prices, threatening marginal exploration and production projects. On Friday, industry leader Schlumberger Ltd ( SLB.N ) reported a 13 percent rise in third-quarter, in line with forecasts, but said the growth of spending by clients would slow in 2009. Its shares fell 6 percent despite a rise in oil prices. Halliburton, on the other hand, rose 3 percent on Friday. Analysts at Pritchard Capital Partners said last week that Halliburton and Baker Hughes Inc ( BHI.N ) had "Schlumberger-like" qualities, but at attractive valuations of about 5 times estimated 2009 earnings, or half of Schlumberger's multiple. Shares of Halliburton have lost 52 percent of their value in 2008, in line with the Philadelphia Stock Exchange oil services index .OSX, while Schlumberger has fallen 49 percent.
