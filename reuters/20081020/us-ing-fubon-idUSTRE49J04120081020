 TAIPEI  (Reuters) - Dutch financial group ING says it will sell its Taiwan life insurance unit to Fubon Financial for $600 million, as it races to raise cash to shore up its capital and restore investor confidence. 

 Fubon said it would issue new shares to ING, giving the Dutch firm a 5 percent stake in the Taiwan company. Fubon also said it would issue subordinated debt securities to ING. ING Life Taiwan is the island's fourth largest life insurer, with a 7.3 percent market share in terms of total premiums. It had total assets of T$600 billion ($18.4 billion) and more than 2.2 million customers at the end of last year. The sale of ING Taiwan Life to Fubon will create a new top-tier local player with assets of nearly T$1 trillion, Fubon said. The combined company will have a 14 percent market share in terms of total premiums and 18 percent in terms of first-year premiums. The deal will add 2.2 million customers to the existing 6.5 million customers of Fubon Financial, whose businesses also include a bank, a brokerage and a property insurance unit. ING said it would remain active in Taiwan through its fund unit, ING Funds, as well as through its ING Real Estate Investment Management and ING Wholsale Banking arms. The Dutch financial giant announced the deal after it became the latest European bank to seek government funding by agreeing to a 10 billion euro ($13.5 billion) cash injection on Sunday. Following a weekend of intense talks after its share price was slashed by more than a quarter in the latest trading session and the partial nationalization of rival Forbis two weeks ago, ING was seeking to shore up its financial position. As governments around the world pour in billions of dollars of state cash to help stabilize their banks, financial institutions like ING and U.S. insurance giant AIG have been selling off non-core overseas assets to help shore up their capital positions. "The acquisition will create a stronger and more balanced financial platform for Fubon with full resources to provide comprehensive financial products and services to our customers," Fubon Chairman Daniel Tsai said in a statement. He said Fubon would keep the rights and interests of ING Life Taiwan's policyholders unchanged after the acquisition. Fubon Vice Chairman Richard Tsai said he expected the deal to be accretive to Fubon Financial's earnings per share. Fubon's shares were down 2.24 percent in early Monday trade in Taiwan, outperforming a 3.22 percent fall for the battered banking and insurance sub-index. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2009. J.P. Morgan acted as Fubon's financial adviser, while Citigroup advised ING. ING is the second-largest foreign life insurer in Asia, behind AIG, which has also been moving to sell some of its Asia assets to raise cash as it struggles in the current global financial crisis. Despite market speculation, AIG has yet to comment definitively on whether it plans to sell Nan Shan Life, Taiwan's No. 3 insurer. Earlier this month, Nan Shan said it would raise $1.45 billion by selling new shares to its troubled parent, as Taiwan insurers scramble to raise new funds as portfolio values plummet amid sell-offs on major global stock markets.
