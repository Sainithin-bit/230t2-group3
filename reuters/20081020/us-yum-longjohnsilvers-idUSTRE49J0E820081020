 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Yum Brands Inc's Long John Silver's on Sunday said it would roll out its first non-fried fish menu items later this month as the restaurant industry responds to consumer calls for healthier food. 

 The new menu, called Freshside Grille, is lower in fat and calories than the quick-serve seafood chain's standard fare. Entrees and side dishes will include grilled Pacific salmon, shrimp scampi, mixed vegetables and seasoned rice. Louisville, Kentucky-based Long John Silver's will begin introducing the new menu in late October at its U.S. restaurants. (Reporting by  Lisa Baertlein ; Editing by  Bernard Orr )
