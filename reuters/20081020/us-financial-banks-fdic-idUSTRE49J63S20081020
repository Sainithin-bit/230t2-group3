 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Each U.S. bank that qualifies for the government's capital injection program will receive a maximum of $25 billion or an amount equal to 3 percent of its risk-weighted assets, whichever is less, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp said on Monday. 

 The FDIC released details of the application process, including stipulating that the minimum amount of an injection will be equal to 1 percent of a qualifying bank's risk-weighted assets. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said earlier on Monday that sufficient capital has been allocated under the program so that all qualifying banks can participate.
