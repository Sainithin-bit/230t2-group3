 BALTIMORE  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Governor Randall Kroszner said on Monday that U.S. consumers face a lot of challenges from a falling "wealth effect" as equity prices and home values suffer big losses. 

 Kroszner said it was "important to think about what the government can do to support economic activity." Answering questions after a speech to the Risk Management Association meeting in Baltimore, Kroszner fell short of endorsing a second federal stimulus plan, which Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke supported in comments to Congress earlier on Monday.
