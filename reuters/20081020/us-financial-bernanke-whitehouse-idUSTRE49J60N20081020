 ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE  (Reuters) - The White House said on Monday it remained open to the idea of a second economic stimulus package but its willingness to accept a new plan would depend on details put forth by the Democratic-led Congress. 

 "We'll remain open to the idea and then we'll just have to see when Congress gets back, if they decide to move forward, what sort of package they want to draft into legislation ... and see if it actually would stimulate the economy," White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said aboard Air Force One with President George W. Bush headed to Louisiana. U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke told Congress on Monday another wave of government spending may be needed to boost the struggling economy. Perino said Bush, who so far has resisted Democratic proposals for a second package, would weigh advice from all of his economic advisers, noting that "obviously Ben Bernanke is a key one."
