 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Federal and New York state prosecutors have launched a broad investigation of the credit default swap market, asking whether CDS data was manipulated by investors to squeeze financial stocks amid a global credit crisis. 

 The prosecutors said they are looking at whether investors drove up prices of CDS transactions reported to data providers but never actually completed. Rising CDS prices, indicating a higher risk of debt default, drove down prices of bank stocks during the past year. Michael Garcia, the federal prosecutor for Manhattan, and New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo told Reuters they have joined forces to investigate the CDS market. Representatives of the two offices declined to comment on companies or individuals being scrutinized. "The efforts of the U.S. Attorney's Office, whose primary role will be to determine whether any federal laws have been violated, will serve to complement the broader mandate of the Attorney General's Office," Garcia's office said in a statement. Cuomo's office said it has issued subpoenas seeking data from a range of financial market players, including stock exchanges, hedge funds and three companies that process swap trades: clearing agent Depository Trust Clearing Corp, CDS data provider Markit, and market data and news company Bloomberg LP. CDS are a form of insurance that bond buyers can purchase to protect themselves against a default. As more investors rely on CDS data to judge a company's financial health, rising CDS prices sent bank stocks plunging and disrupted trading and prime brokerage businesses. The CDS inquiry began several weeks ago but is still in its preliminary stages, the prosecutors said. As in any market-manipulation probe, it is difficult for government authorities to prove a trader intended to break the rules. Representatives of Depository Trust Clearing, Markit and Bloomberg could not be reached immediately for comment. In July, Depository Trust Clearing and Markit formed a joint venture to combine their electronic trade-processing services.
