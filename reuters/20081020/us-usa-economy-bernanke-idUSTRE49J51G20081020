 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke told Congress on Monday that another wave of government spending may be needed as the economy limps through what could be an extended period of subpar growth. 

 Separately, the Conference Board's index of Leading Economic Indicators unexpectedly rose for the first time in five months. KEY POINTS: * It was the first time that Bernanke had explicitly endorsed a second stimulus package. * Bernanke said Congress should consider including measures to improve access to credit, but did not specify what form they ought to take. * He said there were some encouraging signs that steps taken so far to unfreeze credit markets were helping, but it was too soon to assess their full effects. COMMENTS: CHRIS RUPKEY, CHIEF FINANCIAL ECONOMIST, BANK OF TOKYO/MISUBISHI, NEW YORK: "Stocks liked the idea of a second round of stimulus. Bernanke was kind of downbeat in his outlook, seeing weakness for the next several quarters. The testimony was a little on the bleak side. Bernanke's suggestion that considering additional fiscal stimulus would be appropriate was welcome. "The testimony anchors the case for a 50-basis-point cut in the federal funds rate next week. We have the weakest financial market conditions since the Great Depression. You could lower the federal funds rate at least to the 1 percent level it was at during the 2003 deflation scare. There is no reason to keep fed funds rate above the level that got us out of the last recession. The downside risks are pretty great." OMER ESINER, SENIOR CURRENCY ANALYST, RUESCH INTERNATIONAL,WASHINGTON: "For the most part, he's (Bernanke) echoing recent comments by recent Fed speakers. It's noteworthy that he did seem to throw his support behind further fiscal stimulus, which could come in the form of either tax cuts or a stimulus package from the government. So we're seeing a little bit of a reaction to those comments. That's the one noteworthy change I am seeing from recent comments. He did seem to suggest that there've been some encouraging signs in credit markets, which is I think consistent with what we've seen in term of Libor and the narrowing of credit spreads. He's definitely painting a pretty bleak outlook for the U.S. economy and that certainly would tend to boost risk aversion. But I think those comments were mitigated somewhat by his assessment that credit conditions are improving a little bit and also his seeming support of fiscal stimulus." NIGEL GAULT, DIRECTOR, U.S. ECONOMIC RESEARCH, GLOBAL INSIGHT, LEXINGTON, MASSACHUSETTS: "One of most significant things is he's endorsing another fiscal package, which I think makes a lot of sense. "The government is acting as a support for the financial system but it's also got to act as a support for the real economy, almost as a spender of last resort because the private sector spending is going to be declining pretty sharply. "Given the private sector spending will be declining and given that the government is really the only entity that people feel comfortable lending to at the moment it makes sense for the government to borrow from the private sector and spend." VASSILI SEREBRIAKOV, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO, NEW YORK: "The move toward another fiscal stimulus plan is not surprising because the Fed is seemingly running out of options in terms of monetary policy. Bernanke is a very much aware of Japan's deflation and is not willing to lower interest rates to zero. His remarks seem to be positive for stocks and are pushing dollar/yen a little higher." JONATHAN BASILE, ECONOMIST, CREDIT SUISSE, NEW YORK: BERNANKE: "If the Fed Chairman is a proponent of fiscal stimulus, there are two things to read into this. They are not expecting their actions to be the only a solution to the current crisis and number 2 their forecast is more friendly toward inflation and growth is significantly weaker. All hands are on deck. This should not only be fought by the Fed. All policy initiatives should be brought to bear." "Fed funds is already at 1.50 percent. There's not that much more to do for Fed to do in terms of Fed funds. It shows there's not that much more left in their arsenal." LEADING INDICATORS: "Most of it is due to money supply, which is up a lot. It was almost 0.5 percent by itself. Next month's number is going to be terrible. We are not going to read anything into this. The economy is going to continue to show weakness...Your forward momentum is shot. There will be more pain to come." STEPHEN MALYON, CHIEF CURRENCY STRATEGIST, SCOTIA CAPITAL, TORONTO: "Bernanke appears to have restored some confidence in markets by advocating another fiscal stimulus. Although markets may also have been influenced by the stronger than expected U.S. leading economic indicator." GREG SALVAGGIO, VICE PRESIDENT, TRADING, TEMPUS CONSULTING, WASHINGTON, D.C.: "It's interesting to watch (Ben) Bernanke going political now and stepping into the Treasury's territory. For the forex markets the fact that he is now supporting another stimulus plan should be detrimental to the dollar. But liquidity is so thin and with LIBOR rates still very high, companies and other financial institutions are using the dollar to cover all their finance needs. Demand for the buck will remain high at least until the Presidential elections. Until then, I would sell euros any time it gets close to $1.35 and buy it back when it touches $1.33." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. equity indexes extend early gains. BONDS: Treasury debt prices steady near the unchanged mark for the session, with the focus of bond traders on Bernanke's comments on U.S. economic weakness. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar edges higher. RATE FUTURES: Fed fund futures added to chances of 50 basis point interest rate cut at October meeting.
