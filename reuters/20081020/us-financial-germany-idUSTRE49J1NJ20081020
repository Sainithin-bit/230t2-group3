 BERLIN/FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Germany's battered public-sector landesbanks will be among the first institutions to make use of Berlin's 500 billion euro ($672 billion) rescue package despite strict conditions set by the government. 

 Germany's powerful DSGV banking association said landesbanks would tap the fund and urged other banks to do the same. DSGV represents the savings banks that dominate the country's retail landscape and are also big shareholders in landesbanks, which serve as regional wholesale banks. "The manner and extent (to which landesbanks will use the package) will be decided on a case-to-case basis," the association said. Berlin unveiled the outlines of the rescue package a week ago in a coordinated move with other European countries designed to restore confidence in a battered financial sector. On Monday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cabinet approved strict conditions for banks that avail themselves of government funds, including limits on managers' salaries, bonuses and severance. But that did not appear to deter the landesbanks, which have been under financial pressure since troubles in the U.S. subprime mortgage market first erupted last year and snowballed to create a global financial crisis. The financial woes have added to worries that Germany will fall into recession this year, and the government now appears determined to complement the bank rescue with other measures to stimulate Europe's largest economy. On Monday, Berlin said it was considering steps to boost investment in specific sectors of the economy, for example the auto and construction industries. A government spokesman said Merkel's government, an uneasy coalition of her conservatives and the center-left Social Democrats, would decide on such measures in the coming weeks. The ruling parties are worried that a sharp downturn in the economy could hurt their chances in next year's federal election. Fearing a voter backlash, they are also keen to show a readiness to help average Germans and sectors beyond banking that have been affected by the crisis. CAP ON MANAGER SALARIES In a signal that Berlin does not intend to give banks a free ride, the government gave itself far-reaching powers to shape decision-making at banks that tap into the rescue funds. The law approved by Merkel's cabinet on Monday states that it would be inappropriate for managers in these troubled banks to make more than 500,000 euros per year. Banks participating in the scheme would also be forced to scrap severance and bonus schemes that were deemed inappropriate and would not be able to pay out dividends while they were using government funds. Each bank will be allowed recapitalization of up to 10 billion euros, and the fund will assume risks of up to 5 billion euros per bank. Over the weekend, Bavarian Finance Minister Erwin Huber suggested the German state's public sector bank BayernLB was likely to make use of the package. HypoVereinsbank, which belongs to Italy's UniCredit SpA, said it would also look into it. Several of Germany's landesbanks have seen large writedowns linked to the global credit crisis and have been expected to be among the first to use the funds. Other German lenders have been worried that accepting government funds could send the wrong signal to hypersensitive financial markets that have been quick to punish the weak. Commerzbank CEO Martin Blessing has said his bank, Germany's second-biggest, will take a close look at using government funds, but the conditions set by the government on Monday could make large listed banks reluctant. Deutsche Bank CEO Josef Ackermann has all but ruled out the use of state funds. (Additional reporting Christian Kraemer in Munich; Writing by  Noah Barkin ; Editing by  Andy Bruce  and John Wallace)
