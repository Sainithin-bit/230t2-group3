 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Boeing Co ( BA.N ) and its striking machinists union said they will resume talks this week as they look to end a stoppage that has halted production at Boeing's Seattle-area plants for six-weeks. 

 The talks, convened by federal mediators, will start on Thursday morning in Washington, D.C., both sides said on Monday. The 27,000 members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers rejected Boeing's three-year work contract offer last month and walked out on September 6. The two sides briefly tried to find a compromise earlier this month, with the help of federal mediators, but talks collapsed as the parties failed to find common ground on job security and outsourcing of work. Wall Street analysts say the strike is costing Boeing about $100 million a day in revenue and will push its delayed 787 Dreamliner even further off schedule. Boeing, which has not yet detailed the financial effect of the strike, is set to report quarterly earnings on Wednesday. The company's shares, which hit a 4-1/2 year low of $39.99 last week, rose 4.8 percent to $46.71 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday.
