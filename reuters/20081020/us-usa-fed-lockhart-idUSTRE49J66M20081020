 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - The global credit crisis will chill U.S. economic growth well into next year but powerful steps to unlock financial markets have been taken and will work, a top Federal Reserve official said on Monday. 

 "We at the Atlanta Fed expect weakness to persist for some time into 2009 as credit markets gradually improve," Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Dennis Lockhart said in prepared remarks to the Buckhead Rotary Club. "The thawing of credit markets is a necessary condition for a recovery back to levels of growth consistent with the economy's underlying potential," he said. Lockhart is not a voting member of the Fed's interest-rate setting committee this year. The Fed has slashed interest rates and pumped over $1 trillion into financial markets to prevent a credit crisis sparked by massive losses on U.S. home loans from inflicting a deep and damaging recession on the U.S. economy. It cut key rates by a half percentage point to 1.5 percent earlier this month in a sudden inter-meeting decision that was coordinated with other central banks in an unprecedented move. "A broad set of policies have been devised and forceful actions taken to mitigate the effects of this credit contraction. I believe these policies will work," Lockhart said. Financial markets believe that the Fed will lower its benchmark overnight funds rate by at least another 25 basis points by the time of its next scheduled policy meeting, on October 28-29, with a roughly 50 percent likelihood that it will take off another half point. Sharp declines in oil and other commodity prices in recent weeks as investors bet the crisis will trigger a global recession is expected to pull headline U.S. inflation sharply lower next year, removing a potential obstacle to further monetary policy action. Lockhart noted price pressures were heading down. "With the deterioration in economic conditions and the recent associated falloff in energy and many other commodity prices, I anticipate further dissipation of inflationary pressures. "Nevertheless, given high inflation readings during the summer and into the fall, I'll continue to watch developments closely," he said. U.S. headline consumer inflation peaked at a year-on-year rate of 5.6 percent in July and has since drifted back to a reading of 4.9 percent last month.
