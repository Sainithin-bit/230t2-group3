 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Greek political leaders will resume talks on Monday to hammer out a 2013-14 budget cut plan their country needs to qualify for further bailout funds, Socialist PASOK leader Evangelos Venizelos said on Thursday. 
 "We will continue talks on Monday," Venizelos told reporters after a three-hour meeting with Prime Minister Antonis Samaras and moderate Democratic Left leader Fotis Kouvelis. (Reporting by Harry Papachristou)
