 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp has restarted units at its 149,500 barrels-per-day (bpd) refinery in Torrance, California, after finishing planned work, traders said on Thursday. 
 An Exxon spokeswoman confirmed a regulatory filing late Wednesday that reported planned flaring for Thursday through Saturday at the plant, but did not say whether units that were shut for maintenance had restarted. A West Coast trader said on Thursday that the refinery was "back up in full operation." Exxon in early June confirmed that the plant had shut a hydrogen unit and planned to shut a coking unit and hydrotreater for an overhaul. (Reporting By Kristen Hays; editing by John Wallace)
