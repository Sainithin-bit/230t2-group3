 LONDON  (Reuters) - German software group SAP said on Saturday that JP Morgan had advised it on its $3.4 billion acquisition of U.S. cloud-computing software company SuccessFactors. 
 Morgan Stanley was the adviser to SuccessFactors, a spokesman for SAP also said. The deal will provide some solace for the two U.S. investment banks as deals in Europe have come to a virtual halt in the continent's debt crisis. (Reporting by  Douwe Miedema )
