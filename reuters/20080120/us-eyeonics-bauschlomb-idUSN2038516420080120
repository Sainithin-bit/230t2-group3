 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Eye-care company Bausch & Lomb said on Sunday it agreed to buy privately held Eyeonics Inc, which makes an intraocular lens used for the treatment of cataracts. 

 Bausch & Lomb, which went private, also said it expects sales of $654 million to $660 million in the fourth quarter, and $2.51 billion to $2.52 billion for the full year. That compares with 2006 fourth-quarter and full-year sales of $597.6 million and $2.29 billion, respectively, it said. The company said it anticipates fourth-quarter adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of between $120 million and $126 million, compared with $85.7 million in the year-ago period. It expects full-year adjusted EBITDA of between $408 million and $414 million, compared with $338.5 million in 2006. Financial terms of the Eyeonics deal, which is expected to close during the first quarter, were not disclosed. Eyeonics, founded in 1998, markets the crystalens intraocular lens, which replaces the eye's natural lens. Private equity firm Warburg Pincus completed the acquisition of Bausch & Lomb in October for some $4.5 billion, including about $830 million of debt.
