 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The stock of International Business Machines ( IBM.N ), which continues to make sales gains in emerging markets and among smaller U.S. companies, looks cheap, Barron's said on Sunday. 

 The magazine said the stock, which closed up about 2.3 percent at $103.40 on Friday, had not yet reached Barron's target of roughly $125. (Reporting by  Paritosh Bansal ; editing by Carol Bishopric)
