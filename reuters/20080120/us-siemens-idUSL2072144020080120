 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Siemens ( SIEGn.DE ) hopes to know within months exact details of a corruption case that the U.S. markets watchdog SEC has come to view as the biggest in history, Siemens Chairman Gerhard Cromme was quoted as saying. 

 Cromme told German paper Welt am Sonntag that company lawyers had not given him any names of executives swept up in the latest allegations or details of what they may have done. "But I hope to get a extensive dossier and the names in spring. Then we should be far enough along to have a complete overview of who knew what and when and who was responsible," he said. Fresh allegations have emerged from a program that granted amnesty to company whistleblowers, forcing the German conglomerate last week to postpone a shareholder vote, set for Thursday, ratifying management's performance. Only Peter Loescher, who became chief executive last July, has won a clean bill of health in the probe of suspect practices, including allegations employees used slush funds to pay billions of dollars of bribes in return for contracts. Cromme said management had misled the supervisory board in some cases by withholding key information. "It was always reports of isolated cases that the executive board had followed up on and ended. In retrospect, we as the supervisory board had to ascertain that this depiction was not accurate," he said. Cromme and Loescher met the Securities and Exchange Commission last month to discuss the affair, which is also subject to U.S. and German criminal probes. He gave no details about what penalties the SEC might have in mind. "A decision about possible penalties will only come when we have cleared everything up. For the SEC, Siemens is the biggest corruption case in history," he said. German media have speculated that Siemens could face billions of dollars in fines if not a ban from U.S. contracts, as the SEC is able to impose. Cromme said he did not expect the punishment to put Siemens in financial straits. "The issue for U.S. authorities is not whether to force a potential rival of U.S. companies out of the market. We hope that the SEC pays tribute to our efforts to have moved ahead so forcefully. Our U.S. attorneys are in constant dialogue with the market regulator. The SEC has clearly favored the steps taken so far," he said. Cromme said Siemens would seek to recover damages from managers implicated in the scandal.
