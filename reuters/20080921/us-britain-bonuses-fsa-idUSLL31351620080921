 LONDON  (Reuters) - Regulators need to look closely at remuneration regimes at investment banks and brokerage houses following the financial market crisis, the chairman of Britain's Financial Services Authority said on Sunday. 

 "What is appropriate for regulators to do ... is to ask searching questions about the nature of people's remuneration and to ask questions of institutions as to whether they are paying out bonuses before they are really sure whether the profits are really there," Adair Turner told Sky Television. Britain needs to make sure that "we do not have a structure of remuneration in investment banks and trading rooms which allows people to be paid out large amounts of money on profits that are in a sense illusory," he said. The recently appointed chairman also defended the FSA's decision to introduce a temporary ban on short-selling in financial stocks. "The decision made was absolutely appropriate," he said. "We needed exceptional measures and those measures, among other things, have helped recreate a sense of order in the market for financial stocks." He emphasized that the ban was temporary, and conceded that many financial experts argue that short-selling, which involves selling borrowed stock and then buying it back later at a lower price and pocketing the difference, is a "perfectly reasonable" part of a liquid market. But, he said, "it can also produce self-fulfilling downward spirals," as seen on stock exchanges around the world last week. (Reporting by  Luke Baker ; Editing by David Cowell)
