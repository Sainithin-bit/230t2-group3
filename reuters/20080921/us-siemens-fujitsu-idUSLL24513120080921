 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Siemens ( SIEGn.DE ) plans to sell its stake in the Fujitsu Siemens Computers NIXG.UL joint venture to partner Fujitsu ( 6702.T ), German paper Euro am Sonntag reported, citing unidentified, informed people. 

 Fujitsu would then sell on the end-customer business of the joint venture as it is mostly interested in the commercial customer business, the weekly paper reported. A possible buyer is Chinese computer maker Lenovo ( 0992.HK ), Euro am Sonntag reported, citing unidentified people in the industry. Fujitsu Siemens said negotiations between the two partners about the future of the joint venture are ongoing, while Siemens declined to comment. The German-Japanese venture will be automatically extended for another five years from 2009 if neither partner gives notice this year that it wants to get out.
