 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Rep. Barney Frank on Sunday proposed including executive pay limits and foreclosure mitigation efforts in the Treasury Department's $700 billion financial bailout plan aimed at absorbing bad mortgage assets that have paralyzed the U.S. financial system. 

 In a counter-proposal to the Treasury plan, Frank would also put the facility under the oversight of the U.S. comptroller general, the government's main auditor, according to a document obtained by Reuters. Frank's staff gave the proposal to Treasury staff at a meeting on Sunday, a person knowledgeable about the meeting said.
