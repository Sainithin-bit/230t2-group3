 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Car sales of BMW ( BMWG.DE ), the world's largest premium car maker, might drop in 2009 as the company focuses on  its profit margins, WirtschaftsWoche reported, citing a manager of the company. 

 BMW no longer wants to use unit sales as a yardstick for its performance as these do not express the company's profitability, said Philipp von Sahr, BMW's head of sales in Germany, according to the weekly magazine. (Reporting by  Peter Dinkloh ; Editing by David Cowell)
