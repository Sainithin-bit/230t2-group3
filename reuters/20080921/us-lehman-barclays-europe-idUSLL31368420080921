 LONDON  (Reuters) - British bank Barclays Plc will put in an offer for parts of Lehman Brothers' European business on Sunday to meet an indicative deadline set by administrators, a person familiar with the matter said. 

 Barclays bought Lehman's core U.S. broker-dealer business in a $1.75 billion deal on Tuesday, and executives said they would consider buying more Lehman assets outside the United States, such as some equities and equity capital markets businesses in Europe. Barclays and PricewaterhouseCoopers, the administrators for Lehman's European business, declined to comment. (Reporting by  Steve Slater ; Editing by David Cowell)
