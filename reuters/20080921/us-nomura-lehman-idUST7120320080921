 TOKYO/LONDON  (Reuters) - Japan's Nomura Holdings is interested in buying the European operations of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers, according to reports on Sunday, while Barclays will bid for parts of the business, a person familiar with the matter said. 

 Barclays executives said this week they were interested in parts of Lehman's business in Europe, and the source said the bank will pitch an offer for parts on Sunday to meet an indicative deadline set by its administrators. Japan's largest brokerage Nomura will bid for Lehman's European business, Japan's Mainichi newspaper and Britain's Sunday Times reported. It particularly wants the M&A and stock trading divisions, the Japanese paper said. Barclays bought Lehman's core U.S. broker-dealer business in a $1.75 billion deal late on Tuesday, and executives said the next day they would consider buying more Lehman assets outside the United States, such as some equities and equity capital markets businesses. Barclays and PricewaterhouseCoopers, the administrators for Lehman's European business, declined to comment. A spokesman for Nomura said: "We are always exploring options, however we do not comment on market rumours." PwC is expected to move quickly as further delays would cause Lehman to lose customers and staff. Mainichi said that U.S. investment bank Morgan Stanley had approached Nomura for funding. No one was available for comment at Morgan Stanley. The fate of Lehman's non-U.S. businesses is uncertain. Lehman has hired investment bank Rothschild to advise it on the sale of its Asia operations, a person with direct knowledge of the sale process told Reuters on Friday.  Barclays is also seen as a candidate to buy all or part of the Asia business. John Varley, Barclays chief executive, said after sealing the deal for the U.S. business that he was looking at other Lehman assets. "We now have the opportunity, and it's an opportunity that we're looking at quickly and seriously, to see what else might fit with the businesses we're developing around the world," Varley said. The bank said it would typically be in areas where Lehman has strong positions and Barclays is weak, such as in equities and the equity capital markets business.. Barclays said on Sunday that Rich Ricci, chief operating officer for its investment bank and investment management arm, will head the integration of Lehman's U.S. arm. It aims to return the U.S. unit to "business as usual" on Monday after weeks of turmoil. Once the fourth-largest U.S. investment bank, Lehman filed for bankruptcy protection this week, after collapsing from exposure to risky securities backed by U.S. subprime mortgages.
