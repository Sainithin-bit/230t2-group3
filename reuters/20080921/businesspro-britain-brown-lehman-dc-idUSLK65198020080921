  Corrects final paragraph to make clear money transferred to 
New York from London, instead of from New York to London.
 

 MANCHESTER  (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Gordon Brown 
said on Saturday he was pushing the United States to help 
return $8 billion from failed investment bank Lehman Brothers 
to its staff in Britain.  Brown also said he would visit the United States on 
Wednesday to meet with financiers and global authorities to 
discuss the turmoil in financial markets.  "We are asking and working with the American government to 
get that money back to pay salaries, not of high-flying 
financiers, but of cleaners and people who are computer 
operators who would otherwise be denied their money," Brown 
told delegates at the ruling Labour party's annual conference.  Administrators for Lehman's European operations have 
questioned why $8 billion was transferred to New York from 
London just before the bank collapsed.  (Reporting by  Matt Falloon , Editing by Sumeet Desai)
