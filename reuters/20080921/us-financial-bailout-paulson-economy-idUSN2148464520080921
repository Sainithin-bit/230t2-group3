 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, trying to remedy the biggest U.S. financial crisis in decades, said on Sunday, "I wouldn't bet against the long-term fundamentals of this country." 

 "But this is a humbling experience to see so much fragility in our capital markets, and ask how did we ever get here," Paulson told NBC's "Meet the Press" as he sought to sell the U.S. Congress and the American people on his multi-billion-dollar rescue plan. "I'm confident Congress will move and move quickly," Paulson said. Asked about the fundamentals of the U.S. economy, Paulson said, "I won't bet against the American people ... We will work through this." (Reporting by  Thomas Ferraro )
