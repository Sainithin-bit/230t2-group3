 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Institutional money managers will not have to disclose their short positions to the public immediately, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said on Sunday. 

 Under the SEC's emergency rule, the information will be made public two weeks after it is filed electronically to the commission, the agency said in a statement. The new order will take effect at 12:01 a.m. ET on Monday, September 22, the SEC said. (Reporting by  John Poirier  and  Rachelle Younglai )
