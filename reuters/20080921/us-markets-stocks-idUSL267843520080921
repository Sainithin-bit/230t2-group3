 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Stock index futures opened lower on Sunday evening, suggesting U.S. stocks may give back some of Friday's massive rally, as investors awaited details on the workings of the proposed $700 billion bank bailout. 

 S&P 500 futures fell 7.90 points but were below fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures dropped 98 points and Nasdaq 100 futures shed 10 points. Sweeping government measures to rescue the financial system and restore confidence in shaky markets spurred a huge relief rally in U.S. stocks on Friday, ending a week that saw the most dramatic reshaping of the financial landscape since the Great Depression.
