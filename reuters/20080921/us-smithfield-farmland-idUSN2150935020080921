 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - More than 4,000 workers at a pork processing plant of Farmland, owned by Smithfield Foods SFD.N, voted overwhelmingly to reject the company's contract proposal, which included increases in workers' share of health-care costs. 

 Farmland employees at the plant in Denison, Iowa, are members of the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 440, whose bargaining committee also authorized union leaders to call a strike, according to the statement. Smithfield representatives were not immediately available for comment. (Reporting by  Aarthi Sivaraman ; Editing by  Gary Hill )
