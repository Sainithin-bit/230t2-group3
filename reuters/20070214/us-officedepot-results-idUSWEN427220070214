 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Office Depot Inc. ( ODP.N ), the world's No. 2 office-supplies retailer, on Wednesday said quarterly profit rose on slightly higher sales at its North American stores and strong demand for its private-label items. 


 The company said fourth-quarter net income rose to $135 million, or 48 cents a share, from $106 million, or 34 cents a share, a year earlier. Office Depot said it opened 39 stores during the quarter and remodeled 63. The retailer has been closing and remodeling stores in recent quarters, and expanding its private-label merchandise business as it tries to better compete with industry leader Staples Inc. ( SPLS.O ). The Delray Beach, Florida-based company, which operates about 1,158 retail stores in the United States and Canada, said quarterly sales rose 3 percent to $3.8 billion. Excluding special items, Office Depot said it saw a profit of 54 cents a share for the quarter. On that basis, analysts were expecting the company to post earnings of 52 cents a share on revenue of about $3.9 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.
