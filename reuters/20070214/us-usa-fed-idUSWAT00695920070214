 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Wednesday the U.S. economy appears on sound footing with inflation easing, and expressed confidence the current level of interest rates will cut further into price pressures. 


 "Overall, the U.S. economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace this year and next, with growth strengthening somewhat as the drag from housing diminishes," Bernanke told the Senate Banking Committee as he delivered the central bank's semiannual monetary policy report. "There are some indications that inflation pressures are beginning to diminish. The monthly data are noisy, however, and it will consequently be some time before we can be confident that underlying inflation is moderating as anticipated," he said, adding that core inflation was "somewhat elevated." While Bernanke said the Fed's current policy stance, with overnight interest rates at 5.25 percent, was likely to gradually bring nonfood, nonenergy inflation down further, he said the central bank was prepared to act to beat back inflation if necessary. The U.S. central bank has held benchmark borrowing costs steady since pushing them up to their current level last June. Bernanke's comments suggested the Fed is prepared to leave rates on hold for an extended period. "There's no sign the Fed will be moving off the sidelines any time soon," said strategists at Action Economics. Financial markets, which had been braced for a more hawkish warning on inflation, took their cues from Bernanke's view that inflation pressures were ebbing. Prices for U.S. stocks and government bonds rose, while the value of the dollar fell, as traders saw the testimony as suggesting the Fed might be in position to lower interest rates late in the year. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at a record high. A Reuters poll of 21 bond firms that deal directly with the Fed found 14 believe the central bank's next move will be to cut interest rates. Five dealers said they expect the Fed's next move will be to raise rates while two said it could go either way. HOUSING WOES LESSENING In its report, the Fed said the U.S. economy was likely to grow by about 2.5 percent to 3 percent this year and about 2.75 percent to 3 percent in 2008. It said it expected core inflation, as measured by the price index for personal consumption spending minus food and energy, to be 2 percent to 2.25 percent this year, and to edge down to a range of 1.75 percent to 2 percent in 2008. Many Fed officials have said their comfort zone for core inflation is between 1 percent and 2 percent. Bernanke, however, cautioned that there were uncertainties shrouding the forecasts. In particular, he noted difficulties in projecting prices for oil and other commodities, adding: "They remain a key source of uncertainty to the inflation outlook." Bernanke said the downtrodden U.S. housing market was demonstrating tentative signs of stabilization, but he said that did not mean the economy was now set to roar ahead. "Even if housing demand falls no further, weakness in residential investment is likely to continue to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters," he said. He also said it was hard to know how far the U.S. housing slowdown had yet to run and warned that the sector's woes could turn out to be greater than the Fed currently expects. Bernanke was accorded a generally deferential treatment by lawmakers as he faced a committee led by a Democratic Party majority for the first time since he become Fed Chairman in February 2006. Democrats won control of both the Senate and the House of Representative after November elections. Bernanke told lawmakers in response to questions that he expects the inventory of homes for sale to return to normal levels by the end of 2008. He said stabilization of housing markets would depend on the critical spring selling season. In his testimony, Bernanke said that robust economic activity among major U.S. trade partners is helping to spur a solid expansion in U.S. exports and should continue to do so. But Bernanke told lawmakers concerned about the competitiveness of the U.S. auto industry against Japanese car makers that he agreed with Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson that the value of Japan's yen is set in open markets with no overt signs of intervention.
