 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co. ( KO.N ) reported lower fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday, hurt by an asset write-down at its largest bottler, but operating profit exceeded Wall Street expectations. 


 The world's largest soft-drink maker said demand for its products in emerging markets like China and Russia helped offset weak North American results. "(Coke) reported another good quarter, the fifth or sixth in a row that slightly beat the Street (earnings-per-share) consensus while also delivering unit volume growth at or above the top end of its long-term target," Stifel Nicolaus analyst Mark Swartzberg wrote in a research note. Net income fell to $678 million, or 29 cents per share, from $864 million, or 36 cents per share, a year earlier. However, excluding special items, primarily the charge for the write-down at Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. ( CCE.N ), earnings were 52 cents per share, 2 cents better than the average forecast of analysts polled by Reuters Estimates. Coke said net operating revenue rose 7 percent to $5.93 billion, while total unit case volume, a key metric in the beverage industry, rose 4 percent. Coke shares were down 25 cents at $47.96 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. CAUTION IN NORTH AMERICA Case volume in the key North American market fell 2 percent, hurt by a drop in soda and warehouse-delivered water sales, but sales of Dasani water and the energy drink Powerade rose. In recent years, Coke and rival PepsiCo Inc. ( PEP.N ) have been trying to expand their product lines as consumers in many developed markets shift away from sugary soft drinks toward healthier beverages such as water and orange juice. "North America was obviously a disappointment from a volume perspective, but it did contribute with a solid profit growth," Coke Chief Executive E. Neville Isdell said on a conference call. International operations' unit case volume rose 6 percent, due in part to the launch of Minute Maid orange juice in nine new countries. Coke said it saw strong growth across Latin America and in emerging markets such as China, Russia, India, Nigeria, North and West Africa and the Middle East. Volume in Japan rose 2 percent despite declines in Georgia Coffee, a ready-to-serve canned coffee. But Coke saw double-digit unit case volume declines in the Philippines as affordability and availability continued to hinder sales. Strength in emerging markets, while still a relatively small portion of overall revenue, has helped Coke withstand slowdowns in mature markets, whereas Pepsi has relied on its diverse portfolio of snacks and cereals. OUTLOOK Coke expects long-term growth of 3 percent to 4 percent in volume, 6 percent to 8 percent in ongoing currency-neutral operating income, and high-single-digit in ongoing share growth, Chief Financial Officer Gary Fayard said in a conference call. The company said it expects solid performance in most markets except North America, which is expected to lag throughout the first half of 2007. The company expects to repurchase $2.5 to $3.0 billion of its stock this year. The fourth-quarter results came one day after Coca-Cola Enterprises, which is about 35 percent-owned by Coca-Cola Co., reported a $1.71 billion quarterly loss and said it planned to cut 3,500 jobs, or 5 percent of its global work force. The bottler wrote down the value of its North American franchise license intangibles, resulting in a charge of $2.9 billion. Last week PepsiCo, the world's No. 2 soft drink company, reported a 61 percent rise in quarterly profit, but its shares fell on weak demand for its Gatorade sports drink and a conservative forecast.
