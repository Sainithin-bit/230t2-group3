 LONDON  (Reuters) - U.S. shares are expected to open slightly firmer on Wednesday ahead of congressional testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, while earnings from Coca-Cola ( KO.N ) will dominate a thin earnings calendar. 


 At 1013 GMT, S&P SPc1 and Nasdaq NDc1 futures were up 0.03 and 0.01 percent, respectively, while Dow futures DJc1 were up 0.04 percent. U.S. stocks rallied on Tuesday after talk that aluminum maker Alcoa Inc. ( AA.N ) may be a takeover target bolstered optimism about deals. Energy shares, such as oil giant Exxon Mobil ( XOM.N ), lent support after U.S. crude oil futures rebounded from Monday's sell off. With corporate results thin on the ground the economy is likely to take center stage. Bernanke's testimony to Congress later on Wednesday and again on Thursday will be scrutinized for hints on the outlook for U.S. interest rates. It may also give key signals to markets about how fast U.S. economic growth will return to trend after slowing somewhat. U.S. growth is seen as key to the general well-being of the global economy. A recent run of strong U.S. data, including a report on unexpectedly robust fourth-quarter productivity, has prompted investors to scale back expectations for an interest-rate cut in the first half of the year. Elsewhere on the economic front January retail sales, due at 1330 GMT, will also be watched closely. Dow component Coca-Cola Co. reports earnings before the stock market opens.
