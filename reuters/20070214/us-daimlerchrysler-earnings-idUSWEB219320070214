 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Fourth-quarter operating profit at DaimlerChrysler rose to 1.877 billion euros ($2.45 billion) despite an operating loss at U.S. arm Chrysler, the world's fifth-biggest carmaker said on Wednesday. 


 Hit by consumer reluctance to buy trucks and sport utility vehicles at a time of high fuel prices, Chrysler swung to a loss of 124 million euros, but premium division Mercedes Car Group boosted operating profit to 1.295 billion. Analysts polled by Reuters had on average expected group operating profit of 1.47 billion euros in the quarter, up from 1.048 billion a year earlier. Daimler proposed a flat dividend of 1.50 euros per share. It forecast total unit sales would increase slightly in 2007. "DaimlerChrysler assumes that total revenues in 2007 will be at least in the magnitude of the prior year. Based on the divisions' projections, DaimlerChrysler should achieve a significant increase in profitability in the planning period of 2007 through 2009," it added. It said it would give a more detailed outlook with first-quarter results once it switches to the IFRS accounting system from U.S. GAAP. The company gave no immediate details on its restructuring program for Chrysler, which was also due to be announced on Wednesday.
