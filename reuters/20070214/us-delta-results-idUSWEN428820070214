 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc. DALRQ.PK said on Wednesday its net loss widened due to reorganization costs, but reported its first full-year operating profit since 2000, and said it was on track to exit bankruptcy protection this spring. 


 Delta, the No. 3 U.S. carrier, said it had reached its goal of $3 billion in annual financial improvements one year ahead of its original target, bringing it closer to its goal of emerging from Chapter 11 protection as soon as late April. The fourth-quarter net loss widened by 60 percent to $2 billion from $1.2 billion a year earlier. The most recent results were hurt by a $2.5 billion charge for reorganization costs. Excluding special items, Delta, which has been operating under bankruptcy protection since September 2005, lost $179 million, an improvement of $603 million from the year-earlier quarterly loss. "There is great momentum building toward a successful emergence from Chapter 11 this spring as a strong, healthy and independent global competitor," Chief Executive Gerald Grinstein said in a statement. Operating revenue rose 5.3 percent to $4.14 billion, but was below the analysts' average estimate of $4.37 billion. Mainline unit costs decreased by 9.3 percent. Still, an analyst said unit costs were higher than he expected. "The real test will be after the restructuring is complete," Calyon Securities analyst Ray Neidl wrote in a research note. Late last month, Delta won exit financing commitments from six major banks for $2.5 billion, which was seen as a major step toward fending off an unwanted $9.8 billion takeover bid from rival US Airways Group Inc. ( LCC.N ). US Airways withdrew its offer on January 31 after Delta creditors rejected it. Atlanta-based Delta's operating income was $6 million for the quarter and $58 million for the full year. Total passenger revenue rose 5.9 percent for the quarter on a 3.6 percent fall in capacity. Consolidated passenger unit revenue rose 9.9 percent. The airline said that at the end of 2006 it had $3.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, with $2.6 billion unrestricted. As of February 12, Delta had hedged about 52 percent of its planned fuel consumption for the first quarter. The company expects its average fuel price for the first quarter to be $1.89 per gallon. Its shares fell 2 cents to $1.10 in over-the-counter trading.
