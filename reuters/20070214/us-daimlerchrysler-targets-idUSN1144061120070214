 AUBURN HILLS, Mich  (Reuters) - DaimlerChrysler has targeted improvements in the profitability of Chrysler beyond the 2.5-percent return on sales it has set as an initial goal by 2009, Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche said on Wednesday. 


 "There is planning going beyond that target," he said, when asked about DaimlerChrysler's longer term planning at a news conference at Chrysler headquarters. Separately, Chrysler Chief Executive Tom LaSorda said he expected talks aimed at getting a concessionary health care deal with the United Auto Workers union would resume soon.
