 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Deere & Co. ( DE.N ), the world's largest maker of agricultural and building equipment, reported better-then-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday as strong sales to farmers and foresters more than offset a decline in sales to builders. 


 Profit rose to $238.7 million, or $1.04 a share, in the fiscal first quarter ended January 31, from $235.9 million, or 99 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 5 percent to $4.20 billion. Analysts' average earnings forecast was 81 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Over the past six months, Deere shares have risen nearly 50 percent, outperforming its 34 peers on the S&P Capital Goods subindex, which rose about 11 percent. Even so, the stock trades at about 8 times expected 2007 earnings, a premium to its peers, which trade, on average, at about 4.8 times expected earnings. Like its rivals, including Agco Corp. ( AG.N ) and CNH Global CNH.N, Deere has benefited from investor excitement over ethanol, the corn-based fuel additive, which has lifted the prices of several key commodities. Since tractor and combine sales typically rise and fall with farmers' cash receipts, rising corn and soybean prices have raised expectations that the agricultural equipment industry is about to enjoy a surge in demand for its products. But so far, that surge hasn't materialized. Earlier this week, a top trade group reported that North American agricultural equipment industry retail sales comparisons started the new year on what Robert McCarthy, an analyst at R.W. Baird, characterized as  "relatively downbeat note," with row crop and four-wheel-drive tractor sales both down "significantly." Even so, most analysts -- and Deere itself -- believe the favorable farm economic conditions will ultimately translate into higher sales. Moline, Illinois-based Deere said it expects its overall sales to rise about 5 percent in the current quarter and to rise slightly for the full year, an improvement over its November forecast for flat sales for the year.
