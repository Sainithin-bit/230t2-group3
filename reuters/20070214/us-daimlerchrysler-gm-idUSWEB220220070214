 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - DaimlerChrysler declined comment on a German magazine report on Wednesday that it was in talks to sell its loss-making Chrysler division to General Motors. 


 "I cannot and will not go into any further details," Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche told reporters in Detroit when asked about GM. The news conference was carried on the Internet. Germany's Manager Magazin cited company sources as saying the talks were in full swing but still at an early stage.
