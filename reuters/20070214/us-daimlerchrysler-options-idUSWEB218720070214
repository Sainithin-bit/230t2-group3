 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - DaimlerChrysler raised the prospect of parting company with its loss-making U.S. Chrysler arm on Wednesday, a move which could unwind a blockbusting 1998 merger creating the world's No. 5 car maker. 


 The group said it would review all options for its Chrysler operations. The announcement ahead of a news conference in Detroit -- the home of the U.S. auto industry -- to outline its turnaround strategy for Chrysler sent the group's stock up more than 5 percent to its highest level since June 2002. It also plunges Chrysler into the maelstrom that has swept up Detroit rivals General Motors Corp and Ford Motor Co as they cut thousands of jobs and close plants to reflect falling U.S. market share amid an onslaught by Asia competitors. The announcement was a departure from the group's clear statement as recently as October that Chrysler was not for sale. "Today the supervisory board will reach a decision on the board of management's decision to restructure the Chrysler Group. The board of management intends to consider other, more far-reaching strategic options with partners in order to support and facilitate the program," the company said. "No option is being excluded in the interest of arriving at the best possible solution for the Chrysler Group and DaimlerChrysler as a whole." The stock peaked at 51.86 euros and was up 4.8 percent at 51.59 euros by 1230 GMT while the DJ Stoxx European car sector index gained 2.1 percent. "The market clearly wants something radical. That might be hard to do given the size of the pension liabilities and the linkages between Daimler and Chrysler," one London trader said. "They'll close some plants and take costs out." German newspapers Handelsblatt and the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) reported that Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche would announce at the news conference that he had hired an investment bank to review strategic options for the group. The FAZ quoted a manager close to the company as saying maintaining the status quo was the least likely outcome. "A divorce on earth will follow the marriage made in heaven," he was quoted as saying, referring to the 1998 merger. Zetsche will also lay out clear margin targets for each business, the FAZ said, citing company sources. The stock has outpaced the index by around 3 percent this year and trades at nearly 14 times 2007 earnings per share, a premium to BMW on 11 times but lagging fellow turnaround play Volkswagen on nearly 15 times EPS. EARNINGS ECLIPSED DaimlerChrysler is due to unveil its latest restructuring plan for Chrysler almost six years to the day after its first attempt at shoring up profits from across the Atlantic. Analysts expect it to cut thousands of jobs and close two North American plants at Chrysler, which Zetsche ran until taking the top spot in Stuttgart at the start of last year. Although growing ranks of shareholders would like to see Chrysler go, divesting it is easier said than done. Bank Sal. Oppenheim analyst Michael Raab estimates it would cost 26 billion euros to separate the two businesses. A real stumbling block is around 18 billion euros in unfunded pensions and healthcare liabilities for retired workers that any buyer would insist the company finance in full, analysts say. It could be difficult to find a buyer for Chrysler, although bankers say a Chinese carmaker bent on expansion abroad would find it attractive if the price was right. Linking Chrysler up with Renault or Volkswagen could offer small-car expertise it lacks. The Chrysler reorganization plan is set to eclipse earnings at DaimlerChrysler. Fourth-quarter operating profit at DaimlerChrysler rose to 1.877 billion euros ($2.45 billion) despite an operating loss at U.S. arm Chrysler. Hit by consumer reluctance to buy trucks and sport utility vehicles at a time of high fuel prices, Chrysler swung to a loss of 124 million euros but premium division Mercedes Car Group boosted operating profit to 1.295 billion. Analysts polled by Reuters expect on average fourth-quarter operating profit to rise 41 percent to 1.47 billion euros ($1.92 billion). Zetsche's credibility is at stake after a surprise profit warning at Chrysler last year as a shift in consumer tastes exposed its reliance on trucks and SUVs as fuel prices rose. It continued to pump out such vehicles even without dealer orders, inflating inventories that required margin-sapping incentives to deplete. Analysts see Chrysler posting a 2006 operating loss of more than 1 billion euros, its third full-year loss since the merger. -- Additional reporting by Sitaraman Shankar in London
