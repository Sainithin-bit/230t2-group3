 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - When DaimlerChrysler Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche introduced George W. Bush to a gathering of business leaders in Detroit two years ago, he could not resist poking fun at the president's Texas twang. 


 "I personally appreciate that, on this day, I won't be the only one here who might be accused of speaking with a bit of an accent," Zetsche said. That was typical of the affable German engineer who has used his sense of humor -- telling self-deprecating jokes while tending bar for reporters at the Detroit Auto Show, for instance -- to become one of the auto industry's best-liked executives. But it has not all been smiles beneath Zetsche's walrus mustache as the head of the world's fifth-biggest carmaker and as a rescuer of the flagging Chrysler division early this decade. As group CEO, he cut more than 9,000 high-paying jobs at premium division Mercedes Car Group in Germany and became the group's first top executive in living memory to visit workers on the factory floor to explain the move. Eager to break down the cultural divide between Stuttgart and Detroit, he moved to cut white-collar staff by a fifth as a way to eliminate corporate red tape. Now he has launched more sweeping job and cost cuts at Chrysler to follow up on the emergency turnaround plan he launched at the U.S. automaker six years ago. That plan cut 40,000 jobs -- more than 30 percent of Chrysler's workforce -- eliminated assembly line shifts, closed some factories and forced suppliers to swallow stiff price cuts. His success at turning around Chrysler vaulted the 53-year-old Zetsche into the top job at group headquarters in Stuttgart, replacing Juergen Schrempp. "Dieter is really an inspirational leader," Mike Jackson, chief executive of U.S. auto dealership group AutoNation, once told Reuters. Jackson worked closely with Zetsche when Jackson served as head of Mercedes-Benz USA. "He has been a great mentor to me and a great mentor to many other executives," Jackson told Reuters. "He attracts talent, motivates talent and inspires talent." Zetsche, who speaks six languages and plays the viola and violin, once described his leadership with a touch of Teutonic charm in a speech to the Harvard Business School. "You can't pretend to be someone you're not," he said. "I'm not a John Wayne kind of leader ... I'm not a flashy guy. I'm bald. I have a big mustache. I wear glasses. I speak English with a bit of an accent. And I don't mind making fun of myself."
