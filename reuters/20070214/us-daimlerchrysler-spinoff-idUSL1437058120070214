 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - DaimlerChrysler's DCXGn.DE chief executive is examining the possible spinoff of the firm's ailing U.S. unit Chrysler, Handelsblatt and Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung said on Wednesday, citing sources close to the matter. 


 DaimlerChrysler CEO Dieter Zetsche was expected to announce at the company's full-year results press conference later on Wednesday that he was looking into all options, including a partial or complete sale of Chrysler, Handelsblatt said, citing supervisory board sources. Zetsche had contracted a U.S. investment bank to examine all options for the U.S. unit, the paper said. "Everything is possible," one person familiar with the matter told Handelsblatt. It was "more likely that something drastic will happen than that nothing will happen". DaimlerChrysler is due to unveil its latest restructuring plan for Chrysler on Wednesday, almost six years to the day after its first attempt at shoring up profits from across the Atlantic. Analysts expect the world's fifth-biggest carmaker to cut thousands of jobs and close two North American plants at Chrysler, which Zetsche ran until taking the top spot in Stuttgart at the start of last year. Handelsblatt added that options would include forming a global alliance with a competitor or floating Chrysler on the stock exchange in New York. Nobody at DaimlerChrysler was immediately available for comment.
