 LONDON  (Reuters) - Investors kept one eye clearly focused on upcoming congressional testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Wednesday while equities again drove close to record highs. 


 The dollar was weaker against the euro and essentially unchanged against the yen. Euro zone government bonds were flat. Oil fell below $59 a barrel after jumping more than 2 percent on Tuesday. Bernanke's testimony to Congress later on Wednesday and again on Thursday will be scrutinized for hints on the outlook for U.S. interest rates. It may also give key signals to markets about how fast U.S. economic growth will return to trend after slowing somewhat. U.S. growth is seen as key to the general well-being of the global economy. "We generally expect that Bernanke's remarks will (show) ... that the Fed is comfortable with the current monetary policy stance, and that ... growth will return to a level at or a little below trend and that core inflation will gradually retreat," Danske Bank said in a note. Stock markets, in the meantime, continued to rack up gains, with MSCI's main world index .MSCIWD close to its all-time high reached last week. European shares rose amid a flurry of corporate results, helped also by rallies in the United States and Asia. The FTSEurofirst 300 index  .FTEU3  of top European shares was up 0.23 percent. Earlier, Asian stocks also rose, with Japan's Nikkei at its highest in nearly seven years on gains in tech firms and blue chips. The Nikkei average  .N225  rose 0.74 percent or 131.19 points to 17,752.64, its highest close since May 9, 2000. The broader TOPIX index  .TOPX  ended up 0.54 percent at 1,765.31, its highest since April 2006. EURO UP The euro hit a six-week high against the dollar as Tuesday's strong euro zone growth data boosted expectations for more interest rate hikes in the region. The dollar held steady against the yen ahead of Bernanke's appearance. Euro zone growth surged to 0.9 percent in the fourth quarter, on a par with U.S. growth rates, cementing expectations that the European Central Bank will raise rates to 3.75 percent in March with perhaps more to come later this year. The euro was up 0.4 percent at $1.3095  EUR= . The dollar was flat at 121.22 Japanese yen  JPY= Euro zone government bonds were flat ahead of heavy new European issuance and Bernanke.
