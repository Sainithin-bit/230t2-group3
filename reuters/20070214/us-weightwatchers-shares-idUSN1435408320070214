 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of Weight Watchers International Inc. ( WTW.N ) tumbled as much as 8.7 percent on Wednesday after the operator of weight-loss centers forecast 2007 profit below analyst expectations. 


 The company said late on Tuesday that it expected 2007 earnings of $2.33 to $2.47 per share, which was below the $2.49 that analysts were expecting at the time. Since the company issued its forecast, the average analyst estimate has fallen to $2.45 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. "Weak guidance should have a particularly negative impact on the stock, given the market had priced in upside with a huge 40.4 percent run-up in the stock since August 14," J.P. Morgan Securities analyst Dara Mohsenian wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday. In a later note, Mohsenian downgraded his rating to "neutral" from "overweight" after the company's Wednesday analyst meeting. During the meeting, Chief Executive David Kirchhoff tried to emphasize Weight Watchers' long-term strategy, which includes reaching out to new markets, stepping up their online presence and improving product promotion and licensing. Before the meeting, analysts said they were concerned about sluggish growth in the North American market and increasing pressure from competitors. "While Weight Watchers highlighted several incremental opportunities in their analyst meeting today under a new CEO, we believe the changes are evolutionary rather than revolutionary," wrote Mohsenian. The stock was down $2.93, or 5.5 percent, at $50.75 in afternoon New York Stock Exchange trading after falling as low as $49.03 earlier in the day. The shares have traded between $37.50 and $55.65 over the past 52 weeks.
