 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Wednesday the United States must tackle the challenge posed to public finances by population aging. 


 "The long-term prospects for the U.S. fiscal situation are quite serious," Bernanke told the Senate Banking Committee in response to a question during semi-annual testimony on monetary policy. He said that unless steps were taken, the retirement of the baby-boom generation and rising healthcare costs could push national debt, measured as a percentage of gross domestic product, to levels not seen since the Second World War.
