 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Wednesday told lawmakers that the central bank is watching for signs that U.S. spending is outpacing underlying productivity capacity. 


 "I believe that flexibility has been essential in helping us make technological advances and create from them economic benefits," Bernanke told the panel in answering questions after testifying on the central bank's twice a year report on the health of the economy. The Fed chief also told lawmakers on the Senate Banking Committee that a flexible labor force and deep capital markets help lead to strong U.S. productivity. "We need to maintain that flexibility in our economy," he said.
