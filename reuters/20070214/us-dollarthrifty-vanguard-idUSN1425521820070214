 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group Inc. DTG.N is in early talks to merge with Vanguard Car Rental, owner of the National and Alamo chains, in a deal valued at more than $3 billion, the New York Times reported on Wednesday, citing people involved in the discussions. 


 The negotiations have been taking place on and off for several months, the paper said, adding that they are at a particularly delicate stage and may still collapse. If completed, a deal would create the third-largest rental car company in the United States behind leaders Enterprise Rent-a-Car and Hertz Global Holdings Inc. ( HTZ.N ), but outpacing Avis Budget Group Inc. CAR.N in terms of revenue, the paper said. A deal with Vanguard would most likely be a reverse takeover, so that Vanguard would be the controlling shareholder, the paper said. Dollar Thrifty and Vanguard were not immediately available to comment.
