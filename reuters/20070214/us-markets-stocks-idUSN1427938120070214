 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rallied on Wednesday, sending the Dow Jones industrial average to a record close, as investors were relieved by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's comments that inflation is poised to ease while the economy grows moderately. 


 It was a broad-based rally, with conglomerates such as General Electric Co. ( GE.N ) and Honeywell International Inc. ( HON.N ) among the biggest gainers. The stock market also got a lift from stronger-than-expected earnings from companies, including Applied Materials Inc. ( AMAT.O ). The Fed chief's message in testimony to Congress eased worries that the U.S. central bank might raise interest rates in an effort to control inflation in the near term. Traders said Bernanke's comments increased hopes that the Fed may cut rates later in the year, which could help enhance corporate profits. "This was a very sanguine comment on inflation, and that was very encouraging," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer of Johnson Illington Advisors in Albany, New York. "It says to me that the Fed is not likely to change interest rates any time soon." Shares of rate-sensitive stocks rose, including American Express Co. ( AXP.N ) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. ( JPM.N ). The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  rose 87.01 points, or 0.69 percent, to end at a record 12,741.86, its 28th since the beginning of October. The Standard & Poor's 500 index  .SPX  advanced 11.04 points, or 0.76 percent, to finish at 1,455.30. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  gained 28.50 points, or 1.16 percent, to close at 2,488.38. The blue-chip Dow average rose as high as 12,759.40, an intraday record, while the S&P 500 climbed to 1,457.65 -- its highest since September 2000. DJ TRANSPORTS AND UTILITIES JUMP Besides the Dow itself, the Dow Jones transportation average .DJT and Dow utilities average .DJU hit record closes, according to Dow Jones Indexes. The last time this happened was on March 17, 1998, it said. The Dow Jones transportation average rose 2.1 percent to end at 5,117.27, while the DJ utilities average gained 0.4 percent to finish at 477.07. It was the second day of strong gains for the stock market. On Tuesday, the Dow snapped a three-day streak of losses and had its biggest gain of the year. Shares of Applied Materials, the top supplier of equipment for making microchips, rose 3.9 percent, or 70 cents, to $18.89 on the Nasdaq. The company posted a profit that topped expectations. It also said revenue could rise as much as 5 percent in its current quarter. In other earnings news, farm equipment maker Deere & Co. ( DE.N ) jumped to an all-time high at $113.72 after it reported stronger-than-expected profit. <ID:nN142833511>. In New York Stock Exchange trading, Deere's stock ended at $111.91, up 9 percent, or $9.24, for the day. SWEET TALK FROM THE FED Bernanke told the Senate Banking Committee the economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace this year and next, with growth strengthening as the drag from housing ends. He added there were indications that inflation pressures were beginning to diminish.  "This is a little love note to the market," said Ethan Harris, chief U.S. economist at Lehman Brothers in New York. On Thursday, Bernanke will give the second part of his semiannual testimony to Congress, by appearing before the House Financial Services Committee. Shares of industrial conglomerates, which are sensitive to the economy's cycles, and financial services stocks were among those giving the biggest boost to the blue-chip Dow average and the broad S&P 500. GE's stock gained 1.7 percent, or 60 cents, to $36.37, while Honeywell advanced 2.2 percent, or $1.03, to $47.54. Shares of American Express rose 1.9 percent, or $1.09, to $58.69, while JPMorgan's stock added 0.9 percent, or 47 cents, to $51.42. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note US10YT=RR fell to 4.74 percent, down from 4.79 percent before Bernanke's testimony, and down from 4.81 percent late on Tuesday. The Fed chief's calm assessment of inflation pressures and the economy stirred a relief rally in the bond market. The 10-year note's price, which moves inversely to its yield, shot up 19/32. GARMIN'S STOCK HEADS DUE NORTH The Nasdaq also was boosted by navigational device maker Garmin Ltd. ( GRMN.O ), which said fourth-quarter earnings more than doubled. Garmin's stock climbed 8.1 percent, or $4.29, to $57. Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT.O ) shares rose 1.3 percent, or 37 cents, to $29.40, after it agreed to settle a class-action lawsuit in Iowa that accused the world's largest software maker of overcharging consumers in the state.  Trading was moderate on the New York Stock Exchange, with about 1.52 billion shares changing hands, below last year's estimated daily average of 1.84 billion, while on Nasdaq, about 2.28 billion shares traded, above last year's daily average of 2.02 billion. Advancing stocks outnumbered declining ones by a ratio of more than 2 to 1 on the NYSE and by about 3 to 2 on Nasdaq. (Additional reporting by Tamawa Kadoya and  John Parry )
