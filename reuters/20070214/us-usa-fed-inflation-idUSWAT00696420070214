 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Wednesday told lawmakers that recent measures of inflation were encouraging. 


 "We haven't had much information on inflation since just two weeks ago, but the  recent readings on inflation have been encouraging," Bernanke told the Senate Banking Committee after his testimony on the central bank's twice-yearly report on the economy's health. The Fed chief also told the panel in answering questions that at the rate the economy has been growing, it is reaching full employment. "Clearly we are much closer today than we were a few years ago," he said.
