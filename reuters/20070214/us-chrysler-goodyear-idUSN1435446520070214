 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Chrysler Group Chief Executive Tom LaSorda said on Wednesday he would consider a retiree health-care deal similar to the one Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. reached with the United Steelworkers Union. 


 Speaking to analysts and investors on a conference call following Chrysler's restructuring announcement, LaSorda said of Goodyear's deal with its workers: "Absolutely, yes, it's something that we would consider. We've done a lot of analysis on that ... we continue with our discussions with the UAW." The Goodyear agreement created a $1 billion health-care fund for retirees that, if approved by federal courts, would start with a company contribution in stock and cash. The company's one-time contribution would free it from paying retiree benefits in the future. Chrysler, which said Wednesday it will cut 13,000 jobs as part of an effort to return to profitability, hopes to resume talks with the United Auto Workers union on health-care concessions. Last year, the union declined to give concessions to Chrysler.
