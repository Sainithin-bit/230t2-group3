 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wall Street was unsurprised to hear of more takeover speculation in the mining sector on Tuesday, but despite a surge in Alcoa's stock price, few analysts believed the U.S. aluminum giant was about to be gobbled up. 


 Alcoa Inc. shares rose as much as 10 percent early on and there was also frantic options trading surrounding Alcoa after London's Times newspaper reported BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto Ltd. were both considering bids worth about $40 billion for the Pittsburgh-based company. Most analysts saw such a scenario as unlikely and said even if there was some truth to the speculation, it would be a thorny deal fraught with operational and regulatory problems. "Speculation of an Alcoa takeover by Rio Tinto or BHP Billiton is not new," wrote Lehman Brothers analyst Peter Ward, who downgraded Alcoa's investment rating. "We believe a takeover by either of these companies is unlikely." While UBS analyst Glyn Lawcock felt an Alcoa takeover by one of its Anglo-Australian rivals made good business sense, he thought the timing was "questionable" for BHP given its recent $10 million buyback announcement and the retirement of Chief Executive Chip Goodyear. "Such an acquisition would make sense given that both BHP and Rio have the financial flexibility and that Alcoa's refining assets are long life and low cost," Lawcock said. David Gagliano of Credit Suisse wrote that there would be "certain hurdles that acquirers would need to overcome," while Charles Bradford of Bradford Research/Soleil cut Alcoa's rating from 'buy' to 'hold,' saying he would give a less-than-even chance of Rio Tinto or BHP acquiring Alcoa. Most analysts agreed that anyone eyeing up Alcoa would most certainly only be interested in its upstream, or mining and smelting, operations, rather than downstream businesses manufacturing products such as kitchen foil. Brian Hicks, co-manager of U.S. Global Investors' $1.1 billion global resources fund, said he was skeptical of BHP or Rio buying Alcoa. "The consensus opinion is that it is probably not very likely and I am in that camp. "Rio and BHP are primarily upstream producers and would not want the rolling mills and packaging, which would require pretty big divestitures." Hicks said merger speculation was rife because mining companies are raking in the highest prices in a decade for metals, from copper to zinc and aluminum. With strong balance sheets and cash in hand, they are looking to reinvest. "And it is cheaper to buy a competitor than explore and start new mines. It is a trend we see continuing," he added. ALCAN INSTEAD? BMO Capital Markets' Victor Lazarovici noted that neither BHP nor Rio had commented on the Alcoa report. "But in our opinion the major mining companies constantly consider potential acquisitions and, of the stocks that we cover, Alcoa and Alcan are among the most attractive based on assets and valuation," he wrote in a note. Indeed, Canadian aluminum producer Alcan was cited by others as another, possibly more likely acquisition target. Alcan, which does not have the same type of downstream business as Alcoa, may be a more interesting takeover target for large mining companies looking to increase their aluminum operations, an industry source told Reuters. A mining company that wants to buy Alcoa could potentially reach a deal by teaming up with a private equity buyer that is interested in the packaging business, the source said, which most large mining companies would not want. But he noted rumors of Alcoa and Alcan being bought have been around for quite some time and surface almost annually. BMO's Lazarovici said although downstream assets may not necessarily be attractive to major mining groups, a recently announced takeover of aluminum products maker Novelis by India's Hindalco Ltd. suggests such assets may be easier to restructure and worth more than previously thought. Meanwhile, bullish Alcoa options traders outnumbered bears, with more than 72,000 calls and 44,000 puts changing hands in the U.S. options market. This was much more than normal volume of 18,288 contracts, according to market research firm Track Data. "The options action pricing is indicating that BHP or Rio have the financial and management capabilities to do this deal and that is resulting in optimism of some type of transaction occurring in the next few months," said Paul Foster, options strategist at Web information site theflyonthewall.com in Chicago. Alcoa stock, which had risen 10 percent in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange, eased off to close at $35 -- up $2.10 or 6.4 percent.
