 NEWARK, Delaware  (Reuters) - Workers threatened with job losses by DaimlerChrysler AG's decision to close a Delaware assembly plant expressed hope on Wednesday that the facility could be saved despite a wrenching cost- cutting plan for the automaker's Chrysler unit. 


 Chrysler workers had been bracing for weeks for the Wednesday announcement of the turnaround plan for Chrysler, a program of job cuts, shift reductions and proposed benefit rollbacks that became known as the "St. Valentine's Day massacre." The Newark, Delaware plant, which makes two of Chrysler's low-selling sport utility vehicles, had been widely seen as a target for closure. Chrysler confirmed early on Wednesday it would "idle" the plant in two years as part of production cuts that involve the loss of some 13,000 jobs. But members of the United Auto Workers Local 1183, which represents Newark's hourly workers, said Chrysler had not clarified whether the planned closure was final. Some expressed hope Chrysler could still opt to revamp the Delaware plant into a more flexible manufacturing facility more responsive to market needs. Chrysler officials said their aim was to shutter the plant in 2009. "There is no future product at this point for that facility," said Chrysler spokeswoman Michele Tinson. The potential gap between Chrysler's view of the deep cuts it needs to survive and the willingness of its hourly workers to sacrifice will loom large in coming months, analysts cautioned. Chrysler's cost-cutting plan hinges on getting the UAW to reverse course and grant it the same concessionary deal on health care the union gave General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. Chrysler will also be looking for the union to roll back from benefits guaranteed by its current contract when talks begin on a new agreement this summer. The Delaware plant, which employs about 2,000 people, makes the Chrysler Aspen and Dodge Durango models, which like other sport utility vehicles, have suffered from falling sales since last year. Some workers at the local UAW headquarters said the Newark plant should be reconfigured to make a wider range of vehicles. "When we started to build the Durango, people wanted to buy big cars that guzzled gas," said George Vazquez, 42, who has worked at the plant for eight years. "Now the market has changed, and people want more fuel efficient vehicles." A retooled plant could still be viable, said Vazquez, a line worker in the trim department who said he made $53,000 with overtime in 2006. "This is the beginning of something good," he said. "I think I have a big bright future here." A statement issued by the union local also expressed some optimism that Wednesday's announcement was not the end of the road for the Newark plant. "The announcement was what we expected. It could have been worse. They could have just told us they were closing the plant," the statement said. But Chuck Madarani, 47, criticized Chrysler management for failing to recognize changes in the market. "They should have been aware of the changes that were coming down the line," he said. Madarani, who has worked at the plant for 28 years, said the work force had delivered all the quality improvements demanded by management in recent years. He felt let down by Wednesday's announcement. "We bust our backsides to make sure nothing leaves our area without the right quality," he said.
