 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Deere & Co. ( DE.N ), the world's largest maker of agricultural equipment, reported higher-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday and raised its fiscal-year outlook, sending its shares up as much as nearly 11 percent to an all-time high. 


 The results, which reflected strong sales to farmers and foresters, suggested a long-awaited ethanol-related spurt in spending on farm equipment might finally be under way. Profit rose to $238.7 million, or $1.04 a share, in the first quarter ended January 31, from $235.9 million, or 99 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting 81 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 5 percent to $4.2 billion. Deere raised its forecast for fiscal 2007 earnings to $1.4 billion from $1.33 billion, saying it expected an increase in agricultural equipment and commercial and consumer business to offset a decline in construction sales. "Originally they were being really cautious about what the ag market was going to do in '07 and building out 2008 to be a little bit stronger," said Morningstar analyst John Kearney. "It looks like now 2007 isn't going to be so bad, which -- if you go on what they've been saying -- feeds hopes for an even stronger 2008." ETHANOL BOOST Like Agco Corp. ( AG.N ), CNH Global CNH.N and other rivals, Deere has benefited from investor excitement over ethanol, the corn-based fuel additive that has lifted the prices of several key commodities. Since tractor and combine sales typically rise and fall with farmers' cash receipts, higher corn and soybean prices have raised expectations that the agricultural equipment industry is about to enjoy a surge in demand. But so far, that surge has not materialized. Earlier this week, a top trade group reported that industry sales in North America had started the new year on what R.W. Baird analyst Robert McCarthy called a "relatively downbeat note," with row crop and four-wheel-drive tractor sales both down "significantly." Even so, most analysts -- and Deere itself -- believe the favorable farm economic conditions will ultimately translate into higher sales. The Moline, Illinois-based company said it expected its overall sales to rise about 5 percent in the current quarter and to rise slightly for the full year, an improvement over its November forecast for flat annual sales. The improvement will come from agricultural sales, which will offset an anticipated decline in construction equipment as the once-hot U.S. housing market continues to correct and builders postpone purchases, Deere said. Deere shares rose $9.24, or 9 percent, to $111.91 on Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange, after touching $113.72 earlier in the session. Agco and CNH also rose. Over the past six months, Deere shares have risen nearly 50 percent, outperforming 34 peers on the S&P Capital Goods subindex .GSPIC, which rose about 11 percent. The stock trades at about 8 times expected 2007 earnings, a premium to its peers, which trade, on average, at a multiple of 4.8.
