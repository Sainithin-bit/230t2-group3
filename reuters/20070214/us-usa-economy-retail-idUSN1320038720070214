 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - January retail sales were unexpectedly flat as motor vehicle, gasoline and electronics sales fell sharply in the post-holiday season after a December that was stronger than originally indicated, a Commerce Department report showed on Wednesday. 


 Economists will pay close attention to these figures as they project economic growth in the first quarter of the new year. In remarks to lawmakers, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Wednesday expressed confidence in the health of the U.S. economy despite a housing slowdown. "Overall, the U.S. economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace this year and next, with growth strengthening somewhat as the drag from housing diminishes," Bernanke said in remarks to the Senate Banking Committee. And in fact, retail sales rose 0.3 percent in January after excluding the volatile automotive sector, which can skew the overall sales figures because automakers frequently change sales incentives. The gain in sales less autos fell short of Wall Street expectations but nonetheless added to a robust and upwardly revised 1.3 percent increase in December. "Fundamentally, the headline January number is a little disappointing but that was offset by the upward revision in December. A 0.3 percent rise ex-autos is also a little weaker than we thought, but it's still a solid increase," said David Wyss, chief economist at Standard & Poor's Ratings Services in New York. "The surprise was the bigger-than-expected drop in autos. This reflects either weaker demand or heavier discounting." The U.S. Treasury bond market, which prefers slower growth and less inflation, was higher in price in late-morning trading. THE INFLATION QUESTION In his congressional testimony, Bernanke warned that risks to the economic outlook and prospects for keeping prices well contained were significant. He said there were some signs inflationary pressures were easing but added a few words of caution. "It will be some time before we can be confident that underlying inflation is moderating as anticipated," Bernanke said. "The prices of oil and other commodities are notoriously difficult to predict, and they remain a key source of uncertainty to the inflation outlook." In its semiannual report to Congress, the Fed said core inflation, as measured by the price index for personal consumption spending minus food and energy, is expected to be 2 percent to 2.25 percent this year, and to edge down to a range of 1.75 percent to 2 percent in 2008. The Fed also predicted U.S. GDP was likely to grow by about 2.5 percent to 3 percent this year and about 2.75 percent to 3 percent in 2008. VEHICLE SALES FALL The retail sales data showed motor vehicle and parts dealer sales fell 1.3 percent in January after an upwardly revised 1.0 percent gain in December. Sales at gasoline stations, reflecting lower pump prices, also fell 0.7 percent after a downwardly revised 3.6 percent gain in December. Sales at electronics and appliance retailers fell 1.2 percent in January after a Christmas flat-panel television buying binge pushed up December sales by 1.8 percent. General merchandise stores, however, bolstered by customers redeeming gift cards, reported a 1.3 percent sales increase, beating their 1.2 percent gain in December. Sales at building material and garden supplies stores reported a 0.8 percent gain in January, reflecting a stabilization of the U.S. housing market. OTHER DATA Separately, applications for U.S. home mortgages rose last week, driven by an increase in loan refinancing, the Mortgage Bankers Association said on Wednesday. The trade group said its seasonally adjusted index of mortgage application activity rose 1.5 percent to 639.8 in the week ended February 9. And ever mindful of the shifting winds of demand, U.S. businesses kept their inventories unchanged in December, which is the first time they did not add to their stocks since the summer of 2005, a Commerce Department report said.
