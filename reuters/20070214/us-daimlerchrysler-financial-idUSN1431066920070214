 AUBURN HILLS, Michigan  (Reuters) - DaimlerChrysler AG is targeting a return on equity of between 14 percent and 20 percent for its financial services unit, Dieter Zetsche, the chairman of the automaker, said. 


 Zetsche said DaimlerChrysler Financial Services had achieved a return on equity of 18.2 percent in 2006. The comments were made in the text of a speech for delivery in conjunction with a review of the company's fourth-quarter and 2006 results for analysts and investors. Zetsche said in the prepared remarks that the return on equity target would mean that DaimlerChrysler's financial services unit would be "well positioned for profitability" in future years.
