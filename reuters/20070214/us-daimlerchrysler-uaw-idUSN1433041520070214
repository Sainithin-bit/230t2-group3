 DETROIT  (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers union on Wednesday called DaimlerChrysler AG's Chrysler Group's restructuring plans "devastating," adding that the automaker cannot cut its way to profitability. 


 "Today's action by DaimlerChrysler is devastating news for thousands of workers, their families and their communities," the union said in a statement. "Over the past six years DaimlerChrysler has closed or sold 16 facilities and reduced its work force by one third. The company cannot cut its way to profitability." DaimlerChrysler on Wednesday laid out a dramatic restructuring plan for Chrysler that includes cutting 13,000 jobs -- around 16 percent of the workforce -- and closing two sites. The plan also includes slashing production capacity by 400,000 units through 2009. "The actions announced today will be the subject of ongoing discussions and 2007 national negotiations between the UAW and DaimlerChrysler," the UAW said.
