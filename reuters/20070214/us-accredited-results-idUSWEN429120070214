 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Accredited Home Lenders Holding Co. LEND.O, a California subprime mortgage lender, reported a fourth-quarter loss on Wednesday, hurt by worsening conditions in the market for loans to people with weaker credit histories. 


 The net loss for the San Diego-based company totaled $37.8 million, or $1.49 per share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $43.3 million, or $1.96 per share.
