 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Office Depot Inc. ( ODP.N ), the world's No. 2 office-supplies retailer, said on Wednesday its quarterly profit rose 27 percent, but its sales fell short of Wall Street's expectations and its shares dropped 2.5 percent. 


 The company said fourth-quarter net income rose to $135 million, or 48 cents a share, from $106 million, or 34 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, Office Depot said it saw a profit of 54 cents a share for the quarter. On that basis, analysts were expecting the company to post earnings of 52 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. "The bottom line is that the quarter was not a disaster, but not very solid either," Credit Suisse analyst Gary Balter said in a research note. Chief Executive "Steve Odland and his team have done a tremendous job leading the turnaround efforts to date," said Balter, who has a "neutral" rating on Office Depot's stock. Sanford Bernstein analyst Colin McGranahan called it "a messy fourth-quarter as one-time charges and gains clouded the results. Adjusted for these nonrecurring events, however, fourth-quarter results appeared to be moderately ahead of consensus expectations," wrote McGranahan, who has an "outperform" rating on Office Depot's shares. The Delray Beach, Florida-based company, which operates about 1,158 retail stores in the United States and Canada, said quarterly sales rose 3 percent to $3.8 billion, slightly below the consensus forecast of $3.9 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Office Depot said it opened 39 stores during the quarter and remodeled 63. The retailer has been closing and remodeling stores, and expanding its private-label merchandise business as it tries to better compete with industry leader Staples Inc.  ( SPLS.O ). Office Depot's stock trades at 19.54 times 2007 earnings, a discount to rivals Staples and OfficeMax Inc. OMX.N, which trade at 21.02 and 26.5, respectively. Its shares have fallen about 22 percent from their 52-week high of $46.52 reached May 11.
