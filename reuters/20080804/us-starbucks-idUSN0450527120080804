 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp filed its separation agreement on Monday with Jim Alling, the former president of Starbucks Coffee International, who will receive a lump sum payment equal to 12 months of his base salary. 

 Alling last week was replaced by Starbucks Chief Operating Officer Martin Coles -- who had in the past been president of Starbucks Coffee International -- as the coffee chain shakes up its ranks, closes stores and cuts workers in a bid to turn around its business. A prior filing showed Alling's base salary was $600,000. Among other things, Alling will also receive a lump sum payments equivalent to the cost of continuation coverage for his health insurance.
