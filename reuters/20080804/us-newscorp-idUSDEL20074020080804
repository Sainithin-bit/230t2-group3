 MUMBAI  (Reuters) - News Corp chief Rupert Murdoch said television advertising in the United States was good, despite a slowing economy, while Asia was a long-term bet driven by the emergence of a wealthy middle class. 

 During a visit to Mumbai on Monday, Murdoch told reporters advertising for News Corp's television properties in the United States was very good. "Our advertisement on television and the Internet is very, very good, except for local television," he said. "Cable networks are all sold out for 12 months," he said, adding that Britain was holding up "very well". Murdoch has repeatedly warned a slowdown in advertising on U.S. local television stations and newspapers would have a severe impact on media businesses. Shares of News Corp, which owns media properties including the 20th Century Fox movie studios, Internet social network MySpace and the Times of London newspaper, are among the worst hit media stocks this year on concerns the sector will be hurt by an economic slowdown. Murdoch, who created a global media empire from a pair of newspapers in Australia, said he remained convinced of the long-term opportunity in Asia, where India is set to become the top pay-TV market by 2012, despite increasing fragmentation. "In the long term, the media and advertising outlook for Asia is tremendous as wealth is created and people get educated and you see the emergence of a wealthy middle class," he said. Murdoch said the U.S. media conglomerate plans to invest $100 million in six regional-language television channels in India, where News Corp is the leading broadcaster. But Murdoch, who has been one of the most aggressive buyers of media companies, including last year's acquisition of Dow Jones & Co for about $5.6 billion, said he would only enter the Indian print space if rules on foreign investment were relaxed. "We don't see ourselves taking a stake in print -- because it is not available and because we won't want to take just a 26 percent stake," Murdoch said, referring to the cap on foreign investment in news media in India. GOING REGIONAL In India, where News Corp controls top broadcaster Star, and has ventures for cable distribution and satellite, it is facing a tougher fight from local firms such as Zee Entertainment Enterprises and ventures of global rivals such as Walt Disney, Viacom and Turner International. Annual revenue for television in India, which is seeing an explosion of new channel launches, is forecast to more than double to $11.6 billion by 2012, according to research firm Media Partners Asia. But price controls and intense competition will slow the growth of average revenue per user, it has said, while the cost of production, distribution, content and technology will rise. Murdoch said News Corp will launch channels in six Indian regional languages over 12 months, and will expand its presence in movies, and the digital and mobile space, with greater collaboration between Dow Jones Newswires and the Star network. News Corp will more than double Dow Jones Newswires' editorial staff in India to 60-70 in the next six months. "We are happy here; the slower expansion of the economy may slow growth a bit, but in the long term there is a lot of growth to be had," said Murdoch, who on Monday unveiled the 'Global Dow' index, with an additional index called India Titans 30 Index. Murdoch said he was hopeful restrictions on foreign investment in media in India will eventually ease. "A lot of countries have restrictions in the media, but with the expansion of the Internet, the rules are getting ridiculous." "I think in time these rules will be done away with."
