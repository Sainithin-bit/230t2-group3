 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Humana ( HUM.N ) posted second-quarter profit on Monday that beat Wall Street's projections on better-than-expected results for its Medicare prescription drug plans for seniors. 

 The large U.S. provider of Medicare plans also lifted its 2008 profit goal, after sharply reducing its full-year expectations in March. Shares rose 6.4 percent to $47.50 in premarket trading. Humana had warned that high drug costs for its Medicare plans would hurt results this year, but analysts said on Monday that the company appeared to have been conservative. "Humana's original assumptions about the severity of mispricing in the (prescription drug plan) business have turned out to be conservative," Wachovia analyst Matt Perry said in a research note. "We'd be buying HUM shares today." Shares of Humana have performed worse than rivals this year before Monday's trading, as a raft of profit warnings and worries over a downturn has hit investor confidence in the sector. For the quarter, net income fell to $209.9 million, or $1.24 per share, from $216.8 million, or $1.28 per share, a year earlier. Humana, the fifth-largest U.S. health insurer by market value, previously said it expected second-quarter earnings of $1.15 to $1.20 per share. Analysts expected $1.18, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 14 percent to $7.35 billion. Humana's membership in its full-service Medicare Advantage plans stood at nearly 1.35 million, up 19 percent from a year ago. The company has added 202,000 members so far this year, out of an expected 240,000 by year end. Humana's overall consolidated benefits ratio, measuring the percent of premium revenue spent on health benefits, worsened to 85 percent from 83.4 percent a year ago, driven by higher drug claims. The Louisville, Kentucky-based company now anticipates full-year earnings per share in the range of $4.30 to $4.40, up from its previous guidance of $4.10 to $4.35. Humana sharply reduced its full-year expectations in March, blaming an error in designing benefits for one of its Medicare drug plans. But the company has insisted the problems were confined to this year and that results would rebound in 2009. Goldman Sachs analyst Matthew Borsch said the second-quarter results bolster the company's position that its earnings issue has been limited to the drug-plan segment. The company also said on Monday it planned to acquire Cariten Healthcare for about $245 million to boost its presence in Tennessee. Humana shares have fallen 41 percent this year, more than a 34 percent drop for the Morgan Stanley Healthcare Payor index     .HMO.
