 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors have sent subpoenas 
to Wyeth WYE.N seeking information related to the drugmaker's 
promotion and pricing of its ulcer drug Protonix. 

  In a regulatory filing on Monday, Wyeth said it had been 
served with subpoenas for documents and grand jury testimony 
from the U.S. attorney's office for the District of 
Massachusetts.  Wyeth said it was producing documents in response to the 
subpoenas and was cooperating with the investigation.  Until recently, Protonix was one of Wyeth's top-selling 
products. But the company saw its second-quarter sales of 
Protonix fall 59 percent, hurt by generic competition.  Wyeth shares were up 92 cents, or 2.3 percent, at $41.16 on 
the New York Stock Exchange.  (Reporting by  Lewis Krauskopf ; editing by Carol Bishopric)
