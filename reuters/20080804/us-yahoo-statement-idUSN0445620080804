 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc said on Monday it accurately announced the results of Friday's shareholder vote and was not a party to any errors that may have been made by voting institutions or proxy intermediaries used by shareholders. 

 "The independent inspector of elections certified the results of the election and Yahoo accurately announced those results," the Internet company said in an e-mailed statement. Yahoo issued its statement after Capital Research Global Investors, one of its largest shareholders, asked for a probe of shareholder voting, believing there was more opposition to Chief Executive Jerry Yang. Yang was reelected with 85 percent of the favorable vote. (Reporting by  Anupreeta Das ; Editing by  Andre Grenon )
