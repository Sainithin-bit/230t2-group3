 (Reuters) - At least four brokerages widened their 2008 
loss estimates for General Motors Corp ( GM.N ), saying the No. 1 
U.S. automaker's disappointing second-quarter results 
emphasized the need for it to raise cash to combat a severe 
U.S. downturn. 

  The struggling automaker, which has lost more than $51 
billion over the past three years, posted a $15.5 billion 
quarterly loss on Friday as its North American sales fell 20 
percent and plunging prices for SUVs prompted deep charges for 
its auto finance business.  Most analysts believe the company will have significant 
cash issues going forward, with some believing the automaker 
will have to tap external funding sources to meet its capital 
needs.  GM burned through $3.6 billion in cash in the second 
quarter and ended the period with $21 billion in cash and $5 
billion in undrawn credit.  Liquidity will remain an important concern among investors 
as cash flow in the second half of the year is likely to remain 
negative for the company, Goldman Sachs said.  According to Lehman Brothers, the automaker may need $3 
billion to $4 billion of additional secured funding or asset 
sales to remain above its $11 billion to $14 billion of minimum 
working cash needs.  Credit Suisse believes GM's cash burn could reach about 
$6.2 billion in the second half of 2008 and that it could burn 
another $4.2 billion in 2009.  The brokerage widened its third-quarter loss-per-share 
estimate on GM to $3.27 from $2.60.  Citigroup said while the automaker will be able to tide 
over its 2008 capital needs internally, it would require 
external financing to maintain its liquidity above management's 
threshold in 2009.  The brokerage expects GM to spend $7.5 billion in the 
second half of the year, driven by seasonal working capital 
outflows and higher North America losses, and $5.9 billion in 
2009.  Lehman said with its revised 14.0 million unit seasonally 
adjusted annual rate (SAAR) for 2008, it sees more downside 
risk to the automaker's earnings and cash flow, with growing 
pressure to complete a financing and asset sale plan to provide 
sufficient liquidity through the downturn.  SAAR is a closely tracked indicator of auto industry 
demand.
  FORD BETTER POSITIONED  Lehman said it remained more comfortable with the 
turnaround prospects at GM's rival Ford Motor Co ( F.N ).  While both are doing a credible job on cost reduction, Ford 
is better placed due to its stronger cash position and clearer 
car strategy.  "While we expect industry pressures to also weaken Ford's 
liquidity, we estimate that Ford will end 2009 with $15.3 
billion in cash without raising additional cash," Lehman 
analyst Brian Johnson wrote in a note to clients.  GM shares were trading at $10.27 in afternoon trade on the 
New York Stock Exchange. They have lost about 58 percent of 
their value since the start of the year.  Ford shares, which have shed more than 30 percent 
year-to-date, were up about 4 percent at $4.83.  (Reporting by Dilipp S. Nag in Bangalore; Editing by Himani
