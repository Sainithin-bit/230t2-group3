 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Sanjay Jha, the new co-chief executive and head of Motorola Inc's MOT.N struggling mobile devices business, said on Monday that he would take about 90 days working with Motorola employees, partners and customers to review the business. 

 "I don't know that I have a magic plan today." said Jha in a telephone interview with Reuters. "It will take me about 90 days to ... figure out what is the right way to move this business to the next level." Jha said the company was still committed to splitting off the money-losing mobile devices unit but that he would work on improving the unit while the details were being worked out. "Job number one is to continue to execute really well and deliver the new products to the marketplace," he said. Greg Brown, co-CEO and head of Motorola's broadband mobility unit, which sells network equipment and television set-top boxes. said he was open to all options for improving shareholder value for the business even as he said he would concentrate on expanding the division independently. "Our focus on broadband mobility would be to continue to grow the business organically," Brown said in an interview but added, "We'll always look at all options." Jha said he plans to move from California to the Chicago area to be closer to Motorola's headquarters in Schaumburg Illinois, a Chicago suburb. (Reporting by  Sinead Carew ; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)
