 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Capital Research Global Investors said on Monday that the fund management group has asked for a recount of the strong showing in favor of the reelection of Yahoo Inc's board of directors last Friday. 

 The arm of Capital Research and Management, a major Yahoo shareholder, confirmed the outlines of a report in The Wall Street Journal that cited unnamed sources as saying the fund group headed by portfolio manager Gordon Crawford had questioned the number of votes for Yahoo CEO Jerry Yang. "Capital Research Global Investors has asked Yahoo to recheck the vote totals and Yahoo is doing that," said Chuck Freadhoff, a spokesman for the Capital Group and its affiliates.
