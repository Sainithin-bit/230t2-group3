 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Fox International Channels and The Wall Street Journal plan to expand an agreement to work together that will see the newspaper's content promoted on television networks in Latin America. 

 Although Fox International Channels (FIC) does not own news networks in any of its 16 channels in Latin America, it will begin advertising the content from the paper's The Wall Street Journal Americas (http:www.wsjamericas.com) Spanish and Portuguese language site. FIC and the Journal are owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. The agreement represents the latest development how Murdoch aims to use the sprawling global assets of News Corp to expand the Dow Jones franchise, which he purchased for $5.6 billion last year. WSJ Americas ads will begin appearing on Fox, FX and National Geographic channels in the region. Over time, that relationship could be further expanded, Hernan Lopez, chief operating officer of FIC, said in a phone interview. "We may in future start putting news updates on screen and invite viewers to see more of the news on wsjamericas.com," he said. Little known in the United States until a few months ago, Fox International Channel owns .Fox Networks, an online advertising network that sells unused ad inventory on websites outside of the United States. In May, FIC launched Worthnet.Fox, an ad network focusing on financial news and investment advice, and struck a deal to be a third-party ad sales representative in the region.
