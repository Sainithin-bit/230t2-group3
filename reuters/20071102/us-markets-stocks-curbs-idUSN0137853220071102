 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The New York Stock Exchange said on Thursday it instituted downside trading curbs at 9.38 a.m. EDT as U.S. stocks fell sharply in early trading. 

 A downgrade of Citigroup Inc, the No. 1 U.S. bank, sparked concerns about the financial sector. The New York Stock Exchange Composite Index, which is used to determine when to begin trading curbs, was down 212 points, or 2 percent, at 10,099. The trading curbs require that all program selling of S&P 500 stocks must be on an up-tick.
