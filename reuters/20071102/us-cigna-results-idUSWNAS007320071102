 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Cigna Corp reported a bigger-than-expected third-quarter profit increase on Friday on strength in its international and reinsurance segments, but its shares fell after the company forecast next year's earnings below Wall Street's target. 

 Cigna, whose earnings release concludes a mixed reporting season for large U.S. health insurers, also lowered the top end of its membership forecast for 2007. FTN Midwest analyst Peter Costa said investors were likely disappointed with Cigna's forecast for earnings for its main health care segment. "The guidance was fairly conservative in particular on the health care business," Costa said. "That reflects the fact that next year will be an investment year as the company expands into some newer areas," Costa said, namely its Medicare business for seniors and operation serving small businesses. Strong enrollment growth has helped drive the company's stock up 18 percent this year, before Friday's trading. Its shares fell $2.37, or 4.6 percent, to $49.38 in Friday morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. For the quarter, net income rose 22 percent to $365 million, or $1.28 per share, from $298 million, or 92 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, earnings were $1.14 per share, 21 cents ahead of the analysts' average forecast, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 6.5 percent to $4.41 billion. Analysts said that much of the quarterly earnings surprise stemmed from Cigna's non-core businesses, deflating some of the enthusiasm for the results. For 2008, Cigna projected adjusted earnings of $4 to $4.20 per share. Analysts had expected $4.21. The company projected 2008 healthcare earnings of $740 million to $780 million for its main health care segment. The middle of its forecast would amount to growth of about 10 percent. Before the company issued its outlook, Goldman Sachs analyst Matthew Borsch had said in a research note that Cigna needed to target health earnings of above $780 million in order to drive the stock higher. Membership in Cigna's health plans was 10.2 million at the end of the quarter, about 900,000 higher than a year ago. After-tax adjusted earnings in the health care segment slipped to $173 million from $177 million. The results included an after-tax charge of $6 million from a disease management pilot program in Georgia. This business also suffered because of lower volume in its mail-order pharmacy and a decline in one part of its fully insured membership from the end of 2006. A closely watched measure of the share of premiums spent on medical costs improved to 83.9 percent from 85.7 percent a year earlier. Cigna said it now expected to report 2007 earnings of $3.80 to $4 per share, excluding special items, compared with its view of $3.55 to $3.75 given in August. The company said it expected its health-plan enrollment to show growth of 5 percent to 5.5 percent for 2007, excluding acquisitions. It previously targeted an increase of 5 percent to 6.5 percent. The company projected increasing membership by 3 percent to 5 percent in 2008. Cigna's share-price increase of 12 percent this year has outpaced a 2.5 percent rise for the S&P Managed Health Care index .GSPHMO>, a gauge of large health-insurer stocks.
