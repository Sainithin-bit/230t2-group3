 LONDON  (Reuters) - Renewed fears over credit troubles and the health of banks knocked world stocks and the dollar lower on Friday, and boosted safe-haven bonds while investors held vigil for a key U.S. employment report later in the day. 

 Credit market sentiment worsened after brokerages downgraded Citigroup ( C.N ) and Bank of America ( BAC.N ) on Thursday, a day after the Federal Reserve cut U.S. interest rates to limit economic damage from the housing market's downturn. Concerns about the fallout from U.S. subprime mortgages sparked a sell-off in risky assets and pushed up the cost of interbank lending in August and September, prompting the world's major central banks to inject liquidity to prevent the financial system from seizing up. "We are seeing economic weakness in the U.S. and weakness in financial institutions ... There is reason still for investors to head out of the U.S. and sell the dollar," said Geoffrey Yu, currency strategist at UBS. The FTSEurofirst 300 index was down 0.9 percent, tracking Tokyo stocks and the rest of Asian shares lower. The MSCI main world equity index was down 0.6 percent, tumbling from all-time highs hit on Thursday. Oil prices fell further from this week's record high while gold held below 28-year highs. However, the recent surge in these commodity prices has increased concerns about inflation, which also weigh on stocks. "There are worries over housing, over banks and oil prices pushing higher, and so you have concerns about valuations," said Justin Urquhart Stewart at 7 Investment Management. The iTraxx Crossover index, the most widely watched indicator of European credit market sentiment, widened by 9 basis points to 347 bps. It was a blowout in this index which triggered credit concerns in August. PAYROLLS VIGIL U.S. payrolls data is expected show the economy created 80,000 jobs in October, after an increase of 110,000 jobs in the previous month. "The fact that the data follow the FOMC move to a neutral bias suggests that a print significantly above (levels around 83,000) would support the Fed's message that an ease in December is not to be counted on," Calyon said in a note to clients. "It would likely take a very weak payroll number for market participants to re-price odds in favor on a rate cut in December." Emerging sovereign spreads tightened by 3 bps, while emerging market stocks were down 1.6 percent. The December Bund future was up 9 ticks, drawing safe-haven bids. U.S. light crude was down 0.15 percent at $93.28 a barrel. Concerns over the U.S. economy pulled prices off this week's record high above $96, although they are up more than 86 percent since January. Gold stood at $789.20, ticking higher towards this week's 28-year peak.
