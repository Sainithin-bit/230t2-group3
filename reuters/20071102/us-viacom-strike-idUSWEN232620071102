 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Media conglomerate Viacom Inc VIAb.N said on Friday it has prepared for the possibility of a strike by Hollywood screenwriters, whose labor contract with production studios has expired. 

 Two of Viacom's popular comedy shows, "The Daily Show with Jon Stewart" and "The Colbert Report," which rely on fresh writing on current events, could be affected by a strike and the company would have to evaluate what to do with that programming. But overall, the company sees little or no effect from a strike for its units including the Paramount movie studios and MTV Networks cable channels. "We have been preparing for the possibility of a strike," Viacom Chief Executive Philippe Dauman said on a conference call with analysts. "We have a good pipeline of movies that are already produced or are in production which will not be affected." (Reporting by  Michele Gershberg , editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
