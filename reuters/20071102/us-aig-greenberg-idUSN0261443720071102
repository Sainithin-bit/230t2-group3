 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Former American International Group Inc ( AIG.N ) chief executive and major stockholder Maurice "Hank" Greenberg said in a filing on Friday that he was considering "strategic alternatives" for the world's largest insurer. 

 Greenberg, who was forced out of the company, said he anticipated holding discussions with other shareholders and third parties that would "improve ... the value of their investment." Shares of the insurer rose 4.4 percent to $61.77 in after-hours trade, after closing at $59.12 on the New York Stock Exchange. Its 52-week low, set on Oct 25, was $58.46. As of last month, Greenberg owned or controlled more than 300 million shares of AIG, according to Reuter's data. Greenberg's filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission comes at a time when AIG is trading near its 52-week low because of investor fears about its exposure to securities backed by subprime mortgages. AIG officials could not be reached for comment immediately.
