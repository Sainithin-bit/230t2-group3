 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. tax authorities at the Internal Revenue Service are focusing on the private equity and hedge fund industry in an attempt to discover if fund managers are paying their taxes properly. 

 The move is the latest government effort to look at taxation in the industry, as Congress has also been considering bills that would raise taxes on the senior executives of private equity firms. Private equity firm Blackstone Group LP's ( BX.N ) $4.13 billion initial public offering earlier this year focused attention on how partnerships pay their taxes. In a statement on Thursday, the IRS said it would look at hedge funds and private equity as part of a bigger effort to gather information about large business taxpayers. Specifically, the IRS said it "seeks to identify any areas of possible non-compliance in the income tax reporting of hedge fund and private equity fund investors and managers, as well as possible non-compliance in the reporting of withholding obligations." For example, the IRS plans to probe how fund managers categorize income as a capital gain versus ordinary income, and whether  the accounting methods the taxpayers are using clearly reflect their income. Under U.S. tax law, partnerships like Blackstone do not pay the 35 percent corporate tax rate, but rather distribute nearly all their profits to common unit-holders, who individually pay the 15 percent capital gains tax. Also, executives at private equity firms that buy out poorly performing corporations typically take a 2 percent fee on such transactions and keep 20 percent of the profits from major transactions, in an arrangement known as carried interest that also qualifies for lower tax rates. Critics have said the industry is unfairly exploiting a tax loophole that should be closed but Blackstone has said these methods are  standard practice. The increased attention on hedge funds and private equity, is a change for the IRS which has tended to do relatively light audits of partnerships in the past, according to Viva Hammer, a partner at law firm Crowell & Morning, and former associate tax legislative counsel at the office of tax policy at the Treasury Department. "Partnerships have very complicated, extremely intricate tax rules... and people have been aware for a long time that this is an area that should have more resources devoted to it," Hammer said. "There's much more money at stake in these partnerships." A Senate bill introduced in June proposed that taxes on publicly traded partnerships should be more than doubled. (Reporting by Emily Chasan)
