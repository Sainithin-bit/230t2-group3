 NEW YORK/PARIS  (Reuters) - Trans-Atlantic exchange operator NYSE Euronext NYX.PANYX.N posted a nearly fourfold increase in quarterly profit on Friday as this summer's credit market turmoil drove record trading volumes. 

 Stock exchanges benefited during the third quarter as market volatility caused by the subprime mortgage crisis spurred trading. Earnings surged at German exchange operator Deutsche Boerse ( DB1Gn.DE ), which reported a 44 percent rise in third-quarter profit. Nasdaq ( NDAQ.O ), the second largest U.S. equities market after the New York Stock Exchange, said recently quarterly net income doubled, excluding special items. Ongoing cost cuts also helped drive NYSE Euronext's net income to $258 million, or 97 cents per diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, up from $68 million in the year-ago quarter. "The quarter appears to be a solid, expense-driven beat of our expectations," said Fox-Pitt, Kelton analyst Edward Ditmire. Excluding merger costs and other items, NYSE Euronext earned $202 million, or 76 cents per share, beating analysts' average estimate of 72 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Total revenue for the quarter was about $1.2 billion, double the $602 million NYSE Euronext earned in the year-ago quarter. Analysts were expecting the operator of the New York, Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels and Lisbon exchanges to earn revenue of $986.3 million, according to Reuters Estimates. Derivates trading made up one-fourth of NYSE Euronext's net revenue (excluding various payments and fees) during the quarter. European cash trading made up 18 percent of net revenue and the remainder came from its U.S. equities trading, market data and listings businesses. NYSE Euronext said its European cash markets had their best quarter ever with an average 1.34 million trades per day, up 85.5 percent year on year. NYSE Group Inc completed its merger with Euronext NV in April. The stock has gained 30 percent since mid-September but remains about 14 percent below its share price in April when the combined joint stock started trading in Paris. NYSE Euronext shares were down $1.25 at $89.70 in morning trading.
