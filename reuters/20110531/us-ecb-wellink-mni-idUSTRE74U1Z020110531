 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Europe's economic recovery is losing steam but it is far too early to say for sure it has peaked, European Central Bank Governing Council member Nout Wellink was on Tuesday quoted as saying. 

 "For the moment I'm inclined to say that it's clear the recovery is losing steam," the Dutch National Bank president told news agency Market News International in an interview conducted on Saturday. "But for the moment I just see this as some volatility. You absolutely can't derive from that the conclusion that we have already been at the top of the cycle -- absolutely not." Wellink also said the 17-country bloc's central bank would increase its interest rates if it believed inflation or expectations for price growth in the euro area were set to rise. "Our policy is to prevent further acceleration of the inflation rate in the period ahead," Wellink was quoted as saying. "So if we have the feeling that inflation and inflationary expectations would go up further in 2012, then additional monetary measures are necessary." Annual euro zone inflation fell to 2.7 percent in May from 2.8 percent in April, but still remains well above the ECB's goal of below, but close to 2 percent. Turning to Greece, Wellink said restructuring of its sovereign debt was a "non-issue" which would have negative implications and could spread to other debt-ridden countries. Greece does not want to restructure and can manage without doing so, he told Market News. "I'm still confident that the Greeks will deliver," he said.
