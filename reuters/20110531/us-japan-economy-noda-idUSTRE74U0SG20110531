 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japanese Economics Minister Kaoru Yosano said on Tuesday that the government must act to preserve fiscal discipline. 

 "The government and politicians must always bear in mind the need to maintain fiscal discipline and must act to achieve this end," Yosano told reporters. Credit rating agency Moody's on Tuesday placed Japan's sovereign ratings on review for possible downgrade, citing concerns about a weak policy response to faltering economic growth prospects. Yosano said that he was unhappy about the move. (Reporting by  Tetsushi Kajimoto ; Editing by  Joseph Radford )
