 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japanese government bonds fell on Tuesday as data fueled hopes that factory output may rebound quickly from disruption caused by the March earthquake and tsunami, with broker hedging ahead of a 10-year JGB auction pushing up yields from near multi-month lows. 

 Long-dated JGBs were also seen weighed by profit-taking from Japanese banks in the wake of a downgrade on Tokyo Electric Power. Market players said that holders of Tepco bonds may have been selling JGBs to make up for possible losses on the utility's debt. Position tweaking by market players before a 2.2 trillion yen ($27.1 bln) 10-year auction on Wednesday helped exacerbate the fall in JGBs, said a trader for a Japanese bank. Lead June 10-year JGB futures dropped 0.28 point to 140.63, dipping back below resistance at 140.91, their 200-day moving average. JGB futures have tested that level over the past week but have not managed to break clearly higher. "There seems to be a bit of reaction to the data showing that output is expected to post a V-shaped recovery," said Jun Fukashiro, chief fund manager for Toyota Asset Management. Bonds with maturities over 10-years were also weighed down after Standard and Poor's cut its credit rating on Tokyo Electric Power to junk status on Monday. The credit default swap on Tepco widened to a record 950 basis points on Tuesday. While industrial output rose less than expected in April, manufacturers surveyed by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry expect output to rise 8.0 percent in May and increase 7.7 percent in June. MUTED REACTION There was a muted reaction from JGB futures after Moody's said it had placed Japan's Aa2 sovereign rating on review for a possible downgrade, adding that while a JGB funding crisis was unlikely in the near to medium term, pressure could build over the longer term. Nobuto Yamazaki, executive fund manager at DIAM Asset Management, said the decision would not have much impact on JGBs. The announcement followed a similar move last week by ratings agency Fitch, which cut its outlook on Japan's sovereign debt. The bulk of JGBs are held by domestic investors who typically take such announcements in their stride. But some players said the warning was behind corrections to superlongs in the afternoon session. The benchmark 10-year JGB yield rose 3 basis points to 1.150 percent and the 20-year JGB yield climbed 4 basis points to 1.940 percent. The yield curve bear-steepened as the rise in superlong yields outpaced those of other maturities. The spread on two-/20-year yields widened to 178 basis points, the highest in almost two weeks.
