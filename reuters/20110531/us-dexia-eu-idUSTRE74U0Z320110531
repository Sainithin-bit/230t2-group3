 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Franco-Belgian financial group Dexia ( DEXI.BR ) is to hold talks with European Union regulators in the coming days to amend a restructuring plan which it agreed to after receiving a bail-out in 2008. 

 On Friday, Dexia -- which received about 6 billion euros ($8.57 billion) from France, Belgium and Luxembourg in September 2008 -- took a 3.6 billion euro hit to clear its balance sheet of low-grade U.S. assets and speed up bond sales. "We will provide the European Commission with all detailed measures in the coming days," a spokeswoman for the group said on Tuesday, referring to the EU's executive branch. Dexia has already divested a Slovakian unit and also needs to sell its public financing businesses in Italy and Spain. Belgian media reported that the talks with the Commission could start as early as Tuesday. (Reporting by Robert-Jan Bartunek; editing by Charlie Dunmore and Erica Billingham) ($1=.7000 euro)
