 BERLIN  (Reuters) - Germany is considering dropping its push for an early rescheduling of Greek bonds in order to facilitate a new package of aid loans for Greece, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter. 

 The report clashed with a separate story in the Financial Times Deutschland, which said Germany, the Netherlands and other countries still wanted private creditors to agree to extend the maturities of their Greek debt as part of any new aid package. But the Journal report was cited by traders as a reason behind a rise in the euro, which pushed above $1.44, to its highest level against the dollar in over two weeks. The German finance ministry declined comment on the report. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, speaking in Hanover late on Monday, said the voluntary participation of private creditors in debt relief for Greece remained on the table. He warned last week, however, against a restructuring of Greek debt in a sign the bloc is exploring softer solutions that would stop short of triggering a "credit event." One compromise solution would be to convince holders of Greek debt that matures in 2012 and 2013 to roll over their holdings, or essentially buy new bonds, in line with the "Vienna Initiative" approach used in central and eastern Europe at the height of global financial crisis in early 2009. Euro zone sources told Reuters on May 19 that this avenue was being explored. A voluntary debt rollover was also expected to be discussed at a meeting of senior European finance officials in Vienna on Tuesday, two European sources familiar with preparations said. These sources said several options were under discussion ranging from simply asking private creditors to commit to maintain their exposure to Greece for the duration of a new program to more ambitious options like extending the maturities of Greek debt by up to 3 years and possibly playing with the interest rates. Greece faces a funding gap of over 60 billion euros in 2012 and 2013. Any private sector involvement is likely to form part of a broader package of measures to fill that hole, including aggressive privatizations and new austerity from the government in Athens, and additional aid from Europe and the IMF.
