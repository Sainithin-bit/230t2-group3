 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund's board is set to decide by the end of June who the next head of the global financial institution will be. 

 The IMF has had 10 managing directors since 1946, all of them European. Four were from France, two from Sweden and one each from Spain, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. The last three managing directors -- Horst Koehler of Germany, Rodrigo Rato of Spain and Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who resigned May 18 -- have left suddenly. Emerging market countries argue that their increasing clout in the global economy, with China and India the world's fastest-growing nations, should give them a stab at the IMF top post. While IMF voting shares were updated in 2008 and again in 2010 to reflect emerging markets' rise, the distribution of power is still heavily skewed in favor of the United States and Europe, which together hold a majority of the votes. So far, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde and Mexican central bank governor Agustin Carstens have been nominated to succeed Strauss-Kahn. Following are some questions and answers about the succession process. WHO DECIDES? The 24-member IMF board, which represents the IMF's 187 member countries, is responsible for selecting -- or firing -- the IMF managing director. The board, led by Shakour Shaalan, an Egyptian national, agreed on a selection process on May 20 and said it had to be done in an open, merit-based manner. The most significant difference from past selection processes is that any IMF member countries can submit candidates. Previously, only IMF board directors were able to put forward names, usually at the instructions of their capitals. The nomination process opened on May 23 and closes on June 10, after which the board will short-list the candidates to three. The nomination process this time has been shortened to three weeks, less than the six weeks in 2007 when Strauss-Kahn was selected. The board has agreed to complete the current selection process by June 30. HOW IS THE SELECTION MADE? The board will interview short-listed candidates and see whether there is consensus among member countries on who should be the next head of the IMF. Failing that, the board will make their selection based on a majority of votes cast. Under 2008 and 2010 voting power, the United States and Europe hold more than 50 percent of the votes needed to keep a European in the job. Along with  allies Canada and Japan, they have close to 60 percent. Together, India, China, Russia and Brazil hold less than 12 percent of vote, according to board officials. Each of the 24 members of the board is allowed one vote, even if the member represents a constituency of countries from other regions. Individual countries cannot cast votes. For example, Switzerland will likely vote with Europe even though it speaks on the board for a constituency of countries including Poland, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Serbia, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Azerbaijan. Also, Spain is in a constituency currently led by Mexico and includes Nicaragua, Venezuela, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Costa Rica. In such cases, the group of countries will have to decide which candidate they will support. WHAT IS THE "GENTLEMAN'S CONVENTION" THAT MAINTAINS EUROPE'S GRIP ON THE IMF HELM? An understanding dating back to World War Two between the United States and Europe has ensured that the head of the IMF is always a European, and the president of its sister institution, the World Bank, is an American. The World Bank is currently headed by Robert Zoellick, whose five-year term ends in mid-2012. Emerging market economies are aggressively challenging the status quo, calling it an "obsolete unwritten convention" that undermines the legitimacy of the fund. The No. 2 at the IMF is also always an American. The current No. 2, John Lipsky, has said he will resign when his term ends in August. While the United States is holding back naming his successor, sources have said the Obama administration is considering White House adviser David Lipton for the post. HOW SERIOUS IS THE EMERGING MARKET CHALLENGE? Warnings by emerging markets to Europe and the United States not to engage in a backroom deal on the next head of the IMF are serious but unlikely to change the outcome. Emerging market countries' voice in the leadership battle has long been muted by internal divisions along geographic, cultural and historical lines. But this time, a joint statement by IMF directors from China, India, Russia, Brazil and South Africa has shown a more united front. In reality, there is little developing and emerging markets can do to force a change because of the IMF's distribution of votes favors the United States and Europe. Europe has collectively always nominated only one candidate, which is then vetted by the United States. Already, Europe has coalesced around French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde. The United States, which is the IMF's largest shareholder, has only once objected to Europe's choice. That was in 2000, when Europe initially put forward German finance official Caio Koch-Weser. Washington's opposition forced Germany to withdraw Koch-Weser and put forward Koehler, who served until 2004. ARE EMERGING MARKET COUNTRIES LIKELY TO NOMINATE A CONSENSUS CANDIDATE? That is still possible. Emerging market countries are still in talks on likely candidates. Many countries appeared to rally in support of former Turkish finance minister Kemal Dervis, who eventually said he would not stand for the post. WHO IS THE LIKELY WINNER? While the nomination process closes on June 10, Lagarde is likely to become the next IMF managing director. She would be the first woman to head the institution. While some on the IMF board are strongly against another politician heading the fund, Europe's voting power and the expected support of the United States and other Western allies will be enough to hand Lagarde the job.
