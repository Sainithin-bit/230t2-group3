 (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc, the insurance and investment company run by billionaire Warren Buffett, will hold its annual shareholder meeting on Saturday in Omaha, Nebraska. 

 The meeting attracted 32,000 people last year. Along with the annual meeting for Wal-Mart Stores Inc, it is perhaps one of the most heavily anticipated shareholder galas. Buffett, 78, took over Berkshire in 1965 when it was a struggling textile mill. Berkshire now owns close to 80 companies and has a market value of roughly $145 billion. The following information about Berkshire and its investments is drawn from the company's 2008 annual report and its website: FINANCIAL INFORMATION: 2008 net income: $4.99 billion Change from prior year: down 62 pct 2008 net income per share: $3,224 2008 revenue: $107.786 billion Cash and equivalents at year-end: $25.54 billion Common stock investments at year-end: $49.07 billion DERIVATIVES HOLDINGS (dollar amounts in millions): Notional Assets Liabilities Value Equity index put options -- $10,022 $37,134 Credit default obligations: -- High-yield indexes -- 3,031 7,892 Individual corporate -- 105 3,900 States/municipalities -- 958 18,364 Other 503 528 Counterparty netting and funds held as collateral (295) (32) Totals 208 $14,612 SELECTED COMPANIES OWNED: Benjamin Moore Iscar Metalworking Borsheim's Fine Jewellery Marmon Holdings Clayton Homes MidAmerican Energy Fruit of the Loom National Indemnity Geico Nebraska Furniture Mart General Re NetJets International Dairy Queen See's Candies MAJOR STOCK INVESTMENTS AS OF DEC. 31, 2008: Market Shares Pct Cost Value Owned * Company Owned (mlns) (mlns) 151,610,700 American Express 13.1 $ 1,287 $ 2,812 200,000,000 Coca-Cola Co 8.6 1,299 9,054 84,896,273 ConocoPhillips 5.7 7,008 4,398 30,009,591 Johnson & Johnson 1.1 1,847 1,795 130,272,500 Kraft Foods Inc 8.9 4,330 3,498 3,947,554 POSCO 5.2 768 1,191 91,941,010 Procter & Gamble 3.1 643 5,684 22,111,966 Sanofi-Aventis 1.7 1,827 1,404 227,307,000 Tesco PLC 2.9 1,326 1,193 75,145,426 US Bancorp 4.3 2,337 1,879 19,944,300 Wal-Mart Stores Inc 0.5 942 1,118 1,727,765 Washington Post 18.4 11 674 304,392,068 Wells Fargo & Co 7.2 6,702 8,973 Others 6,035 4,870 Total Common Stocks $37,135 $49,073 * Also has holdings in Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp and Moody's Corp carried at "equity value," equal to cost plus retained earnings since purchase, minus taxes that would be paid if the earnings were paid as dividends.
