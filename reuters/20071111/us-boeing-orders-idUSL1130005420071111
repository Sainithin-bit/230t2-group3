 DUBAI  (Reuters) - Boeing Co ( BA.N ) expects to win orders for 75 more planes from Middle East carriers this year, a company official said in comments published before the Dubai Airshow on Sunday. 

 The Chicago-based plane maker expects to sign $15 billion aircraft orders with Gulf Arab airlines, Lee Monson, Boeing vice-president for Middle East and Africa commercial plane sales, was quoted in Dubai-based daily Khaleej Times as saying. Boeing had already received 75 aircraft orders in the region this year and expected 150 before the end of the year, Monson said. Gulf Arab airlines ordered 95 planes last year, he said. About a third of the new orders would be for the Boeing 787 dreamliner, added Monson, who declined to say which Gulf Arab airlines would likely make purchases. Emirates EMAIR.UL is expected to order up to 100 mid-sized planes at the Dubai Airshow, which runs from November 11 to November 15. The biennial Dubai event saw deals worth $21 billion announced two years ago. (Writing by Daliah Merzaban; Editing by  Tomasz Janowski )
