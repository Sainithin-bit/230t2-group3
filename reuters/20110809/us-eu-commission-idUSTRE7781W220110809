 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - The European Commission said on Tuesday that it was premature to say that recent market developments indicated that the 27-country European Union was entering a recession. 

 "I'm not sure we can conclude from a few days of serious evolution on the market that we are entering one type of recession or other types of economic recession," Commission spokesman Olivier Bailly told a daily briefing. "We have economic forecasts that are actually more positive than what we see in other analysis made by actors in the financial markets," he said.
