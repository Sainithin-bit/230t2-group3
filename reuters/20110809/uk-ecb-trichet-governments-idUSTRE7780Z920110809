 PARIS  (Reuters) - European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said on Tuesday euro zone governments must work fast to implement new emergency bailout measures for the debt-laden bloc agreed at July 21 crisis talks. 

 "What we ask is that all the decisions which were taken on July 21 be put into effect as quickly as possible," Trichet told Europe 1 radio. (Reporting by  Alexandria Sage  and  Nick Vinocur )
