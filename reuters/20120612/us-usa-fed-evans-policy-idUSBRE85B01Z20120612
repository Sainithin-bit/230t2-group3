 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The world's central banks are independently trying to deal with a slowing global economy, and if the time comes for a more coordinated effort the appropriate authorities would talk about it, a top Federal Reserve official said on Monday. 
 Charles Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, did not, however, suggest such talks were needed now. (Reporting by  Jonathan Spicer ; Editing by Leslie Adler)
