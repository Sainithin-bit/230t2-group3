 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Such firms as Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ) and Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) were among the financial institutions that received payouts from American International Group Inc ( AIG.N ) since the Federal Reserve first began to aid AIG, according to the Wall Street Journal. 

 Citing a confidential document and people familiar with the matter, the Journal said AIG paid at least two dozen U.S. and foreign financial institutions about $50 billion. Goldman received about $6 billion, as did Germany's Deutsche Bank AG ( DBKGn.DE ). (Reporting by  Helen Chernikoff ; Editing by  Gary Hill )
