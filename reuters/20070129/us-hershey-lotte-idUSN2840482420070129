 SEOUL  (Reuters) - U.S. chocolate group Hershey Co. ( HSY.N ) and South Korea's Lotte Confectionery Co. ( 004990.KS ) will set up an $80 million joint venture in Hong Kong to make candies for the Chinese market, Lotte said on Monday. 

 The South Korean company was giving details of the cooperation, previously announced by Hershey. The agreement would mark a move into a potentially huge market for the maker of Hershey's Kisses, Reese's peanut butter cups and other products as it faces higher costs and fiercer competition in the United States. Lotte's Shanghai factory will start manufacturing the candy in April, with sales starting in August. (Additional reporting by Kim Yeon-hee)
