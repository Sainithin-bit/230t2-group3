 MUMBAI  (Reuters) - American Tower Corp. ( AMT.N ) may buy 20 percent in the tower unit of India's Reliance Communications Ltd. ( RLCM.BO ) for $1 billion, the Hindustan Times daily said on Monday, citing sources close to the development. 

 A spokesman for Reliance Communications, India's second-biggest mobile services firm, declined comment on the report. The Financial Times had reported in November U.S. private equity groups Blackstone BG.UL and Carlyle CY.UL were in talks to invest as much as $1 billion in Reliance Communications' tower unit. Singapore state investment agency Temasek TEM.UL and American Tower, a telecommunications tower management company, were also thought to be in talks, the FT had said. Shareholders in Reliance Communications last week approved to transfer the company's more than 12,000 towers and related infrastructure of its CDMA and GSM operations to its subsidiary, Reliance Telecom Infrastructure Ltd.
