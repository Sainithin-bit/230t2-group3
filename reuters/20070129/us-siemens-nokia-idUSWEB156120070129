 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Siemens ( SIEGn.DE ) and Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ) reiterated on Monday they expected their telecoms networks joint venture, which has been delayed by a compliance review at Siemens, to close this quarter. 

 They said they still expected to reduce headcount by about 10-15 percent over the next four years at Nokia Siemens Networks but that actual cuts would only start after checking labor-law requirements and after the joint venture had begun operations. "Nokia and Siemens have made strong progress toward the integration of Nokia Siemens Networks," the two companies said in a statement.
