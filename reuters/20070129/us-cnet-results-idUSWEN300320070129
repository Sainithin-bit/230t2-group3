 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Technology media company CNET Networks Inc. ( CNET.O ) on Monday posted a lower quarterly profit, weighed down by $6.5 million in costs related to a probe into stock options grants and higher expenses. 


 Fourth-quarter net income fell to $6.3 million, or 4 cents per share, from $20.7 million, or 13 cents per share, a year ago. Revenue rose 14 percent to $118.4 million.
