 BANGALORE  (Reuters) - Consulting firm Accenture Ltd. ( ACN.N ) plans to raise its staff numbers in India by 30 percent to 35,000 by August, overtaking the United States as its biggest employment hub, Chief Executive William Green said on Monday. 

 The expansion underscores India's growing importance as a destination for outsourcing. Accenture, one of the world's largest consulting companies, currently employs 27,000 people in India, spread across six cities -- Bangalore, Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Pune and Chennai, accounting for about 19 percent of its global workforce. It has about 30,000 employees in the United States. "At 35,000 people at the end of our fiscal year, India will become the largest country for Accenture, passing the United States," Green told reporters. "India has become such an essential component of Accenture and the men and women here are very important to our success, to our future," he said. Green, who joined Accenture in 1977, said the global outsourcing demand continued to be strong as companies look to improve quality and service by cutting costs. "I think the momentum you have seen in our business over the last 4-5 quarters... you will continue to see that kind of momentum going forward," he said. In December, Accenture forecast net revenue in the current quarter, its fiscal second, of $4.6 billion to $4.8 billion after topping analyst expectations with a 32 percent rise in net income in the November quarter. India's low-cost, English-speaking engineering workforce has attracted a slew of global companies like IBM ( IBM.N ) and Electronic Data Systems Corp. EDS.N, which outsource services such as supply-chain management, payroll processing, and financial analytics. Their growing presence in India present stiff competition to Indian software majors such as Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. ( TCS.BO ) and Infosys Technologies Ltd. ( INFY.BO ). In June last year, IBM said it would invest $6 billion in India over three years as part of its move to increase outsourcing services and client management from Asia's fourth-largest economy. Texas-based Dell Inc. DELL.O, the world's leading personal computer maker, said in March it planned to double its staff in India to 20,000 over three years.
