 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - CITIC Pacific Ltd. ( 0267.HK ) may book HK$1.8 billion (US$231 million) profit from a spin-off of its telecom business CITIC 1616, a Hong Kong newspaper reported on Monday. 

 The Standard cited market sources as saying CITIC Pacific might sell 35 percent of CITIC 1616 and new shares would account for about 10 percent of the enlarged share capital. The paper said CITIC Pacific planned to raise US$300 million by the end of March through listing of the telecom unit. The China-backed conglomerate had said earlier this month it was considering spinning off its CITIC 1616 on the Hong Kong bourse. (US$1=HK$7.8)
