 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Oxiana Resources Ltd. OXR.AX offered on Monday to buy Agincourt Resources Ltd. AGC.AX for A$415 million ($322 million) to expand in gold mining and gain a grip in uranium as it plans to diversify its commodities exposure. 

 The agreed bid drove Agincourt's stock up by nearly a third, while only denting shares in Oxiana, which has a market value of nearly A$4 billion. Analysts said the acquisition would help Oxiana expand beyond in Asia beyond Laos, where it operates the Sepon mine, while boosting its presence in Australia and lifting overall gold mining potential. "Companies are finding out that having all your eggs in one country does not necessarily work," said Shaw Stockbroking analyst Ted Leschke. "This is a way for Oxiana to mitigate its Laos assets." Oxiana offered 0.65 of its shares for every one Agincourt share. This values Agincourt at A$1.92 a share, based on Oxiana's closing price last week, a 33 percent premium to Agincourt's last close of A$1.44 and 39 percent up on its average price over the last 30 days. The bid has the unanimous blessing of Agincourt's board, and was supported by Agincourt's major shareholder, Newmont Mining Corp. ( NEM.N ). Newmont has already agreed to an option giving Oxiana 19.9 percent of Agincourt. Agincourt was up 27 percent to A$1.83 at 0326 GMT, while Oxiana was down 2.4 percent to A$2.89. INDONESIA GOLD PROJECT Once it owns Agincourt, Oxiana said it would proceed with development of Agincourt's Martabe gold project in North Sumatra, Indonesia, which is estimated to hold a resource of 5.8 million ounces of gold. Over the last 12 months, Oxiana shares have risen 47 percent. Agincourt over the same period has risen 18 percent, which is in line with gains in the S&P/ASX200 index .AXJO. "The acquisition of Agincourt continues the Oxiana strategy of owning, developing and operating quality resource assets in the Asia-Australasian region," Oxiana Managing Director Owen Hegarty told a media teleconference. Agincourt also operates the Wiluna gold mine in Western Australia state, a 110,000 ounce per year producer, and has a 57 percent stake in uranium group Nova Energy Ltd. NEL.AX. "Long-term we are looking at diversification, but this also is a way of saying that we are very much in the gold business," Hegarty said. Hegarty said the long-term plan was for further diversification in its commodities, though it was also seeking a re-rating based on its gold operations. Oxiana also said it met its full-year production targets, producing 60,803 tonnes of copper cathode at Sepon and 173,524 ounces of gold. Incremental increases in production could see copper output rise above 80,000 tonnes annually over the next few years, Hegarty said. Copper ore mined by Oxiana is turned into a cathode ready for fabricating into wire and rod at the company's Khanong project 600 kilometers (375 miles) southeast of the Laotian capital Vientiane, to supply buyers mainly in Vietnam and Malaysia. Its Golden Grove mine in Australia yielded 46,605 tonnes of zinc in the December quarter, taking full-year output to 138,817 tonnes, Oxiana said in its fourth-quarter report.
