 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Food distributor Sysco Corp. ( SYY.N ) on Monday posted a 16 percent increase in quarterly profit, helped by intensive efforts to boost sales and cost-cutting measures, in its warehouse system. 

 The company, which distributes food and other supplies to restaurants, cafeterias and other food sellers, said profit was $236.7 million, or 38 cents a share, in the fiscal second quarter, ended December 30, compared with $204.2 million, or 33 cents a share, a year earlier. Earnings per share matched the average of analyst estimates compiled by Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 7.5 percent to $8.57 billion. Sysco has conducted reviews of thousands of its food distribution contracts to find ways to increase sales. The company has said that sales to customers who participate in the reviews increase at a mid-teens percentage rate, on average. Analysts, on average, forecast sales of $8.65 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Food cost inflation was 2.6 percent, as measured by the change in Sysco's cost of goods, the company said.
