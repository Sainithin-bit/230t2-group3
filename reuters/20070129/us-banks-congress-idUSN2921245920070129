 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives introduced a bipartisan bill on Monday that would ban Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) and Home Depot Inc. ( HD.N ) from owning a type of bank known as an industrial loan company (ILC). 


 The move came just two days before the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is to meet to decide whether to extend a six-month moratorium on ILC applications. Banking experts generally expect the FDIC to keep the freeze in place for applications by commercial firms while Congress debates the legislation. "We are seeking to prevent the expansion of a historically small special niche into a full fledge alternative banking system, which dissolves the line between banking and commerce," one of the bill's co-sponsors, Massachusetts Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said in a statement. ILCs are state-chartered and fall under supervision of the FDIC because the agency provides deposit insurance. ILCs can offer a range of services from checking and savings accounts to syndicated and bridge financing. "My concern regarding commercial companies owning banks has grown exponentially as more and more companies have discovered this loophole," Ohio Republican Paul Gillmor, who is co-sponsoring the bill, said in a statement. Wal-Mart said it wants to open such a bank so it can save money by internalizing credit card and check transactions. Home Depot ( HD.N ), wants to buy an existing ILC, CMS Energy Corp.'s ( CMS.N ) EnerBank, to provide home improvement loans. Banks in smaller communities fear their demise if a retail heavyweight like Wal-Mart enters the business. Larger banks see more competition from Home Depot, which wants to provide home improvement loans to contractors. "FDIC insurance was not created to underwrite commercial firms, but to protect the depositors of regulated banks," said Camden Fine, president of the Independent Community Bankers of America. 85 PERCENT, PRE-2003 GRANDFATHERED The bill would prohibit a company from owning an ILC unless it generates at least 85 percent of its revenue from activities that are financial in nature. It also aims to grandfather ILCs granted FDIC insurance prior to October 1, 2003, and those that did not change ownership after September 30, 2003. Their businesses would be unrestricted. However, ILCs that were opened or changed ownership between October 1, 2003 and January 29, 2007, would be limited from expanding beyond their current activities, such as branching into other states. Target Corp.'s ( TGT.N ) bank for example, which offers credit card services to corporate customers, would be unable to expand because it received FDIC insurance in 2004. The bill would also subject the holding company of an ILC, such as Merrill Lynch MER.N, which operates Merrill Lynch Bank USA, to FDIC regulation as long it is not already being regulated by the Federal Reserve or the Office of Thrift Supervision. U.S. banking industry groups support the bill. America's Community Bankers said it would "bring parity to the banking system while reducing potential risks to our financial system." The American Bankers Association said the legislation "takes a reasonable approach" with its ban of future ownership of ILCs by commercial companies. U.S. banking laws have traditionally walled off banking and commerce. But Utah and a handful of other states have permitted nonfinancial companies to own banks through the ILC loophole. The bill faces an uncertain future in the Senate where Utah Republican Robert Bennett, a senior member of the Senate Banking Committee, has repeatedly said he opposes any legislation to curb ILC ownership by commercial companies.
