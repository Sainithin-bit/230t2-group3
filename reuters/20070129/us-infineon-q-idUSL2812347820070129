 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Infineon ( IFXGn.DE ) gave a confident outlook for the coming quarters after its phone-chip unit narrowed its operating loss by more than expected in its fiscal first quarter, lifting its shares 3 percent on Monday. 

 Excluding results from memory-chips subsidiary Qimonda QI.N, which reported strong earnings last week, Infineon said in a statement it expected sales and operating profit at least flat this quarter compared with last quarter, excluding charges. Chief Executive Wolfgang Ziebart reiterated that communications-chips unit Com would break even in the quarter to end-December this year, telling a conference call this would have been reached even without an important new customer win last quarter. Infineon shares were up 3.3 percent to 11.45 euros by 0942 GMT, the top gainer in Germany's blue-chip DAX index  .GDAXI , which was flat. "The results are better than expectations with improving potential for revenue (and thus EBIT) at the company," JP Morgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande wrote in a note, maintaining his "Overweight" recommendation on the stock. Infineon's loss before interest and tax ex-Qimonda was 9 million euros ($12 million) in the first quarter to end-December, compared with a loss of 11 million euros in the fiscal fourth quarter, excluding high fourth-quarter charges. Sales for its non-Qimonda units -- Com and Automotive, Industrial and Multi-Market (AIM) -- declined 9 percent to 958 million euros. Net profit ex-Qimonda was 120 million euros, compared with a loss of 36 million euros in the fourth quarter. Infineon said first-quarter charges were insignificant. Infineon said it expected to win further new customers for its phone-chip platforms to compensate for a major loss of business from BenQ Mobile ( 2352.TW ), which filed for insolvency in Germany last year. "In a mixed market environment, we should return to revenue growth in Automotive, Industrial & Multimarket in the current quarter and see strong design-win momentum in Communication Solutions, in particular in the baseband business," Ziebart said in the statement. "This lets us look to the coming quarters with full confidence," he added. Markets have speculated that Infineon will supply the platform for Apple's ( AAPL.O ) new iPhone. Ziebart declined to comment on who the new customer won last quarter was. BENQ CHARGES "The earnings numbers are significantly better than expected," analyst Heino Ruland of Germany's Steubing brokerage said. "On the other hand, the charges from the BenQ bankruptcy will now be booked in the second quarter." Charges for restructuring related to the BenQ Mobile German bankruptcy will be booked this quarter but will be significantly less than the 30 million euros originally anticipated, Infineon said. Communications unit Com more than halved its EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) loss sequentially to 57 million euros in the first quarter, better than the average loss of 73 million euros forecast in a Reuters poll of 24 analysts. Infineon says the unit will be profitable by the end of 2007. Sales at Com fell 21 percent to 236 million euros, missing the poll average of 249 million. At the AIM unit, EBIT declined 14 percent to 55 million euros, in line with the poll average of 56 million, as weak U.S. car production led to a decline in the automotive business. AIM's sales, down 4 percent to 710 million euros, missed the poll average of 728 million. Infineon trades at 34 times forecast 2007/08 earnings, more expensive than the global semiconductor sector average of 30 times, according to Reuters Estimates. Its shares have outperformed the European technology index .SX8P by 35 percent over the last year -- partly thanks to the carve-out of Qimonda, with its volatile earnings. Infineon plans to reduce its 86-percent stake in Qimonda, the world's second-biggest maker of DRAM memory chips, to a minority, but has given no time frame. A lock-up period expires next month. Qimonda last week reported first-quarter EBIT of 250 million euros, better than the 224 million Reuters poll average.
