 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. ( BMY.N ), seemingly on the verge of shedding past troubles, again found itself the subject of takeover rumors on Monday, sending its shares to a nearly three-year high. 

 An unsourced report in a French publication said drug titan Sanofi-Aventis ( SASY.PA ) -- with whom it sells the blockbuster blood-clot drug Plavix and blood pressure treatment Avapro -- could announce a merger deal with Bristol within the next few weeks. Shares of Bristol rose as much as 7.8 percent, to $28.26 on the New York Stock Exchange. They last were that high in March 2004. Both companies declined to comment. Bristol's fortunes have been rebounding since a U.S. judge last year blocked further shipments of a generic version of Plavix and as the company prepares to seek approval for several promising medicines. However, Bristol has been without a permanent CEO since September, when it fired Peter Dolan, after a failed deal to delay competition to Plavix. "Bristol, whether it's Sanofi or anyone, is quite attractive," said John Farrall, a healthcare analyst with National City Private Client Group. "The fundamentals of this company are intact and fairly strong. It's an obvious target." Sanofi has been thought of as a prime potential buyer of Bristol because of their partnership. Farrall said other large pharmaceutical companies, including GlaxoSmithKline Plc ( GSK.L ), Pfizer Inc. ( PFE.N ) and Merck & Co. ( MRK.N ) could get in the mix. But Farrall cautioned that any bidder for Bristol would have to be confident with the patent risk to Plavix. A federal trial began last week in New York that could determine whether Bristol can stave off generics to Plavix into the next decade. "Any bidder has to be comfortable with the patent protection for Plavix," Farrall said. Bristol has recently launched medicines for rheumatoid arthritis and leukemia, and its stable of experimental medicines include three cancer drugs for which it plans to seek approvals in the next 18 months. Analysts see Sanofi's pipeline complementing Bristol's, particularly with fits in diabetes and cancer treatments. Major divestments, some said, would be limited to Bristol's cancer drug Taxol, which competes with Sanofi's Taxotere. In diabetes, Bristol's oral drugs could complement Sanofi's insulin drugs, as well as its obesity product Acomplia. Following the ouster of Dolan, James Cornelius, former chairman of medical device maker Guidant, has led the company on an interim basis, but the lack of a permanent replacement has fed takeover speculation. "If Bristol does not announce a new CEO in the next month or so, investors could start to ask more questions about whether Bristol could be acquired," Merrill Lynch analyst David Risinger wrote in a research note last week. Bristol shares were up $1.66, or 6.3 percent, at $27.87 in morning trade. (Additional reporting by  Ben Hirschler  in London, Caroline Jacobs in Paris and Ransdell Pierson in New York)
