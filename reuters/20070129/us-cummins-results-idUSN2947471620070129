 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Cummins Inc. ( CMI.N ), a diesel engine maker, said on Monday quarterly earnings rose 13 percent as North American truckers rushed to update their fleets ahead of tough new U.S. clean-air rules, offsetting a steep drop in demand from DaimlerChrysler. 

 Cummins said its power generation and distribution business also had another strong quarter, thanks in part to the ongoing effort to rebuild the shattered infrastructure of Iraq. The company's shares rose nearly 3 percent to $128.42 on the New York Stock Exchange. Cummins said fourth-quarter profit increased to $189 million, or $3.75 a share, from $167 million, or $3.31 a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 10 percent to $3.03 billion. Analysts, on average, expected it to report a net profit of $3.73 a share and a profit from continuing operations of $3.83 a share on sales of about $3 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. But in a note to investors, Peter Nesvold, an analyst at Bear Stearns, said the earnings were "low quality," artificially inflated by a 20-cent-per-share tax benefit. Stripping out that item, which Nesvold said had not figured in anyone's estimates, the company's earnings from continuing operations were "closer to $3.55." Looking forward, Cummins said it expects to earn $11 to $11.50 a share in 2007 despite a forecast downturn in the North American heavy-duty truck engine market as a result of this year's accelerated purchases by truckers. Analysts, on average, expect the company to report earnings of $10.02 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. The company also said it would no longer provide quarterly guidance, a decision Nesvold called "frustrating." AFTER THE PRE-BUY, A FALL? Like rival Caterpillar Inc. ( CAT.N ), Cummins enjoyed record demand in 2006 for its diesel engines as many truck operators -- worried about the reliability and costs of new engines designed to comply with the new environmental law -- rushed to update their fleets before the rule's January 1 implementation. Cummins' diesel engine segment reported sales of $1.95 billion during the quarter, up 6 percent on strong demand for heavy- and medium-duty trucks in North America. Heavy-duty truck engine shipments into that market rose 14 percent during the quarter while medium-duty engine shipments jumped 57 percent. Those gains helped offset a 15 percent drop in shipments of smaller diesels to DaimlerChrysler AG DCXGn.DE DCX.N during the quarter -- a reflection of the sharp production cutbacks at struggling Detroit automakers. But while the heavy- and medium-duty truck engine prebuy bolstered truck- and engine-makers' bottom lines in 2006, it is widely expected to result in a sharp drop-off in sales in 2007. Just last week, Caterpillar predicted that North American truck production would fall 48 percent in 2007, up from its previous forecast of a 37 percent decline, as a result of the new emission rules. The big question hanging over Cummins and others that benefited from last year's pre-buy is how they can continue to grow earnings in 2007. Cummins has promised to do so through increased sales of power generation and distribution systems, turbochargers and exhaust aftertreatment and filtration products as well as by cost-control efforts. Over the past year, the company's shares have risen more than 33 percent, outperforming its 34 peers on the S&P Cap Goods subindex, which has risen about 13 percent. Cummins now trades at about 9.9 times the earnings analysts expect the company to report in 2007, more than double the 4.5 average of its peers on the index.
