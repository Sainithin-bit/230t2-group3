 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Canon Inc. said on Monday it expects profit to rise 8.2 percent this year on robust sales of digital cameras and color copiers, but the forecast was below the market consensus and growth is expected to slow from 2006, when it benefited from a weaker yen. 

 Tokyo-based Canon is enjoying hefty returns from its No.1 market share in digital cameras and color office machines, and like other exporters such as Toyota Motor Corp. and Nintendo Co. Ltd. its overseas earnings were boosted by a weaker yen last year. Profit margins at Canon also outperform those of rivals Xerox and Nikon Corp. as it introduced more factory automation to squeeze costs while expanding its higher-end lineup such as copiers that use more ink and paper. For calendar 2007, Canon expects operating profit to rise to 765 billion yen ($6.3 billion), which would mark an eighth consecutive year of earnings growth. The market expects Canon to post 771.7 billion yen in operating profit this year based on forecasts from 20 analysts polled by Reuters Estimates. Earnings growth is also forecast to slow this year compared with the 21.3 percent profit jump in 2006. Annual sales are expected to rise 7.1 percent to 4.45 trillion yen this year, against a 10.7 percent jump in 2006. THE YEN FACTOR Operating profit in the year ended December 31 totaled 707 billion yen, including 78 billion yen due to the lower yen. "The biggest reason why we expect single-digit growth this year is because of the lack of currency impact," Toshizo Tanaka, a Canon executive in charge of finances, told a news conference on Monday. "But the good business environment won't change." Canon earns more than 75 percent of its sales outside Japan. The weak yen also boosted earnings at smaller printer rival Seiko Epson Corp., which reported better profits than expected on Friday. In the fourth quarter, Canon's operating profit rose 15.7 percent from the same period a year earlier to 195.9 billion yen. That compares with analysts' forecast of 195.5 billion. Canon supplies laser beam devices to No.1 printer maker Hewlett-Packard Co. and competes with Nikon as one of the only two makers of steppers for liquid-crystal displays. Canon, which earns 65 percent of total sales from office equipment, is also preparing to launch digital commercial printers, a market where smaller rival Ricoh is also aiming to expand. Ricoh said last week it would buy IBM's commercial printer business for $725 million. In its camera business, where it competes with Sony and Olympus, Canon is seeing steady growth in digital cameras helped by its strong brand and leading market share. For 2007, Canon expects its digital camera sales to rise 14 percent to 24 million units, which includes a 17 percent rise in digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) models to 3.0 million units. LCD SLUMP Canon expects LCD stepper shipments to drop 42 percent in 2007 to 36 units as panel makers hold back investments. Last week, Japanese chip gear maker Advantest said its quarterly profit fell partly because of slowing demand for its gears used to make LCD drivers. Canon is also the world's third-largest maker of chip steppers, used to print circuitry onto semiconductors, behind Netherlands-based ASML and Nikon Corp. It estimates shipments of its chip steppers will fall 6 percent to 180 units this year. In addition to strong sales of core products, Canon has been raising profitability with cost cuts, such as internalizing production of parts or cutting suppliers. Tanaka said it slashed 119 billion yen in costs last year and aims to cut another 120 billion yen this year. Separately, Canon is set to face litigation in the United State against Nano-Proprietary Inc., which says its plan to develop a new type of display with Toshiba violated a patent agreement. The dispute pushed Toshiba this month to agree to give up its stake in the surface-conduction electron-emitter display (SED) venture with Canon, adding an unexpected twist to Canon's endeavour to enter the booming TV industry. "Even with the change of plan, we still see SED as an important new business," Tanaka said. "Our plan to start selling TVs in Japan during the fourth quarter is unchanged, but we still don't have a plan for mass production. To begin, we will be using our pilot Hiratsuka plant." Analysts have also doubted if Canon and Toshiba would be able to mass produce SED televisions and compete against LCDs and plasma sets, which have faced dramatic price declines. "We are targeting a different genre to LCDs and plasma. We don't plan to roll SEDs out in the same price range," Tanaka said. Shares in Canon closed unchanged at 6,500 yen before the results came out, underperforming the benchmark Nikkei average, which rose 0.28 percent. The stock jumped 8.8 percent over the last quarter, outperforming a 4.5 percent gain in Japan's precision machinery index IPRCS, and the Nikkei's 6.8 percent rise. Mitsushige Akino, chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management, said the market has factored in good earnings and they are unlikely to have a positive impact on Canon's shares.
