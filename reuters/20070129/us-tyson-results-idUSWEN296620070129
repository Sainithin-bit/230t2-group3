 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Tyson Foods Inc. ( TSN.N ), the largest U.S. meat company, on Monday said quarterly profit rose 46 percent, beating Wall Street estimates by a large margin, as cost-cutting measures kicked in. 

 The company's shares rose to their highest level in more than a year. The profit was the first in a year for Tyson, and helped pull shares of other meat companies higher on Monday. "Poultry results were ahead of our expectations and solidly profitable, while beef posted an operating loss and was a bit weaker than we had been looking for," Diane Geissler, Merrill Lynch analyst, said of Tyson in a research note. Geissler maintains a "buy" rating on the stock and has a $19 per share objective. Tyson shares peaked Monday at $17.93 at the New York Stock Exchange, the highest since November 2005. For the first quarter ended December 30, Tyson reported earnings of $57 million, or 16 cents per share, compared with $39 million, or 11 cents per share, a year earlier. Wall Street analysts on average had expected 6 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 1.6 percent to $6.56 billion. Shares of pork producer Smithfield Foods Inc. SFD.N and chicken producers Pilgrim's Pride Corp. PPC.N and Sanderson Farms Inc. ( SAFM.O ) were higher, due in part to Tyson's results, JP Morgan analyst Pablo Zuanic said in a note. However, there are concerns. "We believe Tyson was a great food stock to own in the 1980s, but for the last 10 to 15 years it has mostly lagged; and despite new management, we simply do not see a major turn here yet," John McMillin, analyst at Prudential Securities, said in a research report. A glut of meat and poultry in 2006 and low meat prices prompted Tyson and rival chicken companies such as Pilgrim's Pride to cut production. In addition to reducing production, Tyson's cost-cutting program has included laying off workers and closing meat plants. On Monday, the company said those measures remain in effect. A company spokesman told Reuters Tyson is on track to meet or exceed an annual savings goal of $200 million. "We believe that where we are is where we need to be from a production standpoint," Chief Executive Richard Bond told Wall Street analysts during a conference call. CORN PRICES A WORRY Analysts remain cautious on Tyson due to the high corn prices and their potential impact on future results. Springdale, Arkansas-based Tyson is a huge buyer of corn to feed its chickens; higher prices translate to higher production costs. Corn prices have sped higher since late 2006 due to increased demand from producers of the biofuel ethanol. "We continue to urge caution to investors toward investments in any company that is a big buyer of corn," said Credit Suisse analyst David Nelson, in a research note. During the conference call, Bond acknowledged that he was surprised that corn had reached $4 a bushel. "I probably would have been one who was not anticipating $4 corn in early November," Bond said, adding that "now we have to deal with it." In the quarter, Tyson's chicken and pork segments posted operating profits. The beef business had a loss due to lower average sale prices and operating losses at its Canadian plant. Despite the market pressures, Tyson reaffirmed its prior forecast for fiscal year 2007 for earnings of 50 to 80 cents per share. In afternoon trading, shares of Tyson were up 59 cents to $17.28 on the New York Stock Exchange.
