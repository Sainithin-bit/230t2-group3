 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Schering-Plough SGP.N Chief Executive Officer Fred Hassan on Monday said the company's experimental treatment to prevent blood clots has potential to achieve annual multibillion-dollar sales, if it is approved. 

 Hassan had previously speculated the once-daily pill could achieve blockbuster sales, meaning annual sales of more than $1 billion. Asked on Monday if it could achieve multibillion-dollar sales, he said, "Yes, it looks very attractive and the market is large." The pill, which blocks a protein called thrombin that is involved in the clotting process, is now completing mid-stage trials to determine if it increases the chance of bleeding. The company has said it could begin late-stage trials this year among patients receiving stents -- tiny devices used to prop open coronary arteries. The trials would attempt to prove that patients taking its medicine in combination with aspirin and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co's ( BMY.N ) Plavix anti-clotting drug have fewer heart attacks, strokes and cases of cardiovascular death than those taking only aspirin and Plavix.
