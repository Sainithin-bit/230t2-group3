 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. tech stocks ended higher on Monday, lifting both the blue-chip Dow average and the Nasdaq Composite Index. But a sharp drop in oil prices dragged down energy shares and pushed the S&P 500 down for the day. 


 The sell-off in the energy sector offset the impact of deal news involving such companies as Bristol-Myers Squibb. Based on the latest available data, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 4.81 points, or 0.04 percent, to end unofficially at 12,491.83, while the Standard & Poor's 500 Index was down 1.44 points, or 0.10 percent, to finish unofficially at 1,420.74. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 5.39 points, or 0.22 percent, to close unofficially at 2,440.88.
