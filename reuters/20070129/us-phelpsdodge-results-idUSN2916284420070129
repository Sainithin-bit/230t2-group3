 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Mining company Phelps Dodge Corp. PD.N, an American institution for nearly two centuries, reported a ten-fold fourth-quarter profit increase on Monday, in what could be its last earnings announcement as an independent company. 

 Founded as a trading company in 1834, Phelps Dodge will disappear into U.S. corporate history when its almost $26 billion sale to Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. ( FCX.N ) is completed, as it said it expects sometime in March. "For nearly 173 years, the Phelps Dodge name has been a part of the American and global landscape," Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Steven Whisler said on a conference call with Wall Street analysts. "I'm pleased Freeport McMoRan will keep it alive in the marketplace. We all look forward to making significant contributions to the exciting new company we will become," he said. If there was any doubt about Phelps' potential contribution to what will be the world's largest publicly traded copper company, it was dispelled by the company's swan-song earnings announcement, which smashed analysts' expectations. Fourth-quarter net earnings were $1.3 billion, or $6.50 per share, compared with $121 million, or 60 cents per share, a year earlier, the Phoenix-based company said. Analysts' average earnings forecast was $4.22 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. In its financial report, Phelps Dodge said it produced about the same amount of copper in the fourth quarter as a year earlier, but the higher price pushed revenue up nearly 50 percent to $3.24 billion. Copper averaged $3.20 a pound in the quarter, up from $1.95 a year earlier. The red metal, which peaked at around $3.80 a pound last May, stood at $2.55 a pound on Monday. "We continue to benefit from strong prices for copper and molybdenum, each of which reflects solid market fundamentals," said Whisler, who will retire after the Phelps-Freeport transition period. Phelps' recent earnings have been constrained because the company locked-in portions of its 2006 and 2007 copper production at prices below market prices, which have soared six-fold in the last three years. But in the fourth quarter, it said changes in the value of its hedges boosted earnings by $156.7 million, or 77 cents per share. In the fourth quarter of 2005, when the price of copper was rising, the company took a big charge for its hedging on forward selling contracts. In addition, year-ago earnings were hurt by production problems at a big mine in Chile and special charges totaling $204 million for writing down the value of assets, provisions for environmental issues, and other items. In the 2006 quarter, in addition to the jump in revenue, Phelps paid less taxes and also recognized an after-tax gain of $330.7 million for its failed bid to acquire Canadian nickel miner Inco Ltd. Last November, Freeport McMoRan said it would buy much larger Phelps Dodge for $26 billion in cash and stock. On Monday, Whisler said he expects the deal to close in the current quarter, after shareholder meetings in March. He anticipates no regulatory problems to the merger. Shares of Phelps were down $2.01, or 1.6 percent, at $122.26 in late afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Freeport stock fell over 5 percent to $55.51, as copper for March sale HGH7 fell almost 4 percent in New York.
