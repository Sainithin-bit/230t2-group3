 LONDON  (Reuters) - Britain's Prudential ( PRU.L ) surprised investors on Monday with a 575 million pound ($1.1 billion) cash deal to sell loss-making Internet bank Egg to U.S. giant Citigroup ( C.N ), solving a nagging worry for the insurer. 

 But the sale -- at roughly half the value of the bank when Prudential bought out minority shareholders last year, as the market deteriorated -- will increase pressure on Chief Executive Mark Tucker to find a solution for the rest of his underperforming UK business, which saw flat sales in 2006. Egg accounts for only a fraction of Prudential's group business, but a higher-than-expected 145 million pound full-year loss and Egg's deteriorating value were an embarrassment for Tucker, who took the decision to buy out minority shareholders in 2005 after the group's previous boss failed to sell the bank it founded in 1998. Citigroup, which has a modest retail presence in Britain, said Egg would boost its UK business to four times its current size and was confident it could use "significant synergies" to extract value from the bank, returning it to profit. "It's a deal that is a win for us and a win for Prudential," George Awad, chief executive of Citigroup Global Consumer Group for Europe, Middle East and Africa, said. "Citigroup has watched Egg every day since it was (founded)." Though cheap compared to one billion-pound offers for Egg reportedly rejected by previous management and the roughly one billion pound value of the business at the time of the minority buyout, Egg will be sold at 2.1 times book value at the end of 2006 and analysts said they welcomed the deal as Prudential's first move to improve its UK unit. "It's a step in the right direction," analyst Roman Cizdyn at Oriel Securities said. "It ends an era." Prudential said it would take a writedown at company level but book a profit at group level, with the sale lifting earnings per share in 2007 and helping the group reduce net debt. STEP FORWARD Only last month, after media reports Citigroup was considering a bid, the insurer said it had rejected a bid approach and would focus on "completing the integration of Egg". But, speaking on a conference call on Monday, Tucker said the sale of Egg did not mean Prudential had changed its strategy. Tucker said Monday's deal was a combination of a good offer and a desire to pull out of a market that has worsened since Prudential last updated investors in October, amid a deteriorating credit market and lower lending levels. "We concluded, particularly in the light of the challenging conditions in the consumer credit market, that a sale of Egg would realize greater value than would be achievable through retaining the business," Tucker told analysts. He said distribution deals with Citigroup would allow it to continue accessing Egg's customer base. "I think the market will view this deal as good news," said analyst Kevin Ryan at ING. "It's a sensible thing for them to have done. They seem to have got two times book value for it so I think they've done well." Prudential shares initially climbed on news of the deal, with the market welcoming the end of a drawn-out problem. But the stock eased to close down 0.6 percent at 698 pence. Analysts said some investors had hoped for a better price, while others said concerns continued over the remaining UK business. FUTURE AT HOME? Prudential said last year it was reviewing its strategy at home, with a conclusion due by March. Since then, speculation over the future of its domestic insurance business and Egg, hit by tough conditions in the personal loans market, has been rife. Prudential's UK unit, dragged down by competition in bulk annuity sales and by Egg, has underperformed its peers and overshadowed strong growth at the insurer's fast-growing U.S. and Asian business for the past quarters. Prudential declined to give any update on its plans for its UK insurance business, but full year sales figures released early on Monday underlined concerns that Prudential was still struggling to grow its insurance business at home, with new business broadly flat year-on-year. Overall insurance new business, on an annual premium equivalent basis, beat expectations, climbing 16 percent year-on-year in 2006 to 2.47 billion pounds, boosted by growth in the U.S. and Asia. Jackson National Life, Pru's U.S. unit, achieved record new business of 613 million pounds, a 21 percent jump on the previous year, thanks to strong growth in sales of variable annuities. The insurer's Asian life operations had sales of 956 million pounds, up 30 percent on 2005, again above forecasts. The UK, however, saw overall sales up just 1 percent under APE, though UK retail insurance sales were up 14 percent to 689 million pounds, primarily driven by growth in individual annuities and corporate pensions.
