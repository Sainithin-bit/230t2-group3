 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Con-way Inc. ( CNW.N ) said on Monday its quarterly net profit rose, citing the sale of a business unit that made up for what the trucking and logistics company described as a "slack economy." 


 "Our financial performance in 2006 was not up to the standards our shareholders and employees have come to expect," Chief Executive Douglas Stotlar said in a statement, adding that this would be a catalyst for change in how Con-way does business. The company reported fourth-quarter net income of $84.2 million, or $1.65 cents a share, compared with $51.8 million, or 89 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding items, earnings per share were 82 cents for the quarter. Wall Street analysts had, on average, expected earnings per share of 74 cents for the quarter, according to Reuters Estimates. Con-way said it expects 2007 earnings per share in a range of $3.60 to $3.90. Analysts, on average, have forecast earnings per share of $3.79, according to Reuters Estimates. The San Mateo, California-based company said from now on it will only provide a full-year outlook that will be updated quarterly. The company's fourth-quarter results include a net gain of $41 million from the sale of Vector SCM LLC, a logistics joint venture with car manufacturer General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ). Con-way reported fourth-quarter revenue of $998.6 million, compared with $1.07 billion a year earlier. Analysts had, on average, expected revenue for the quarter of $1.001 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.
