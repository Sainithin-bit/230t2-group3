 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Merrill Lynch & Co. Inc. MER.N said on Monday it will buy First Republic Bank ( FRC.N ), which caters to the rich and specializes in luxury home lending, for $1.8 billion. 

 Merrill Lynch's cash-and-stock offer of $55 a share represents a 44 percent premium over First Republic's closing price Friday. That premium is partly for First Republic's wealthy demographic, which includes borrowers whose average net worth is $19.2 million, Atlantic Equities analyst Joe Dickerson said. Wall Street analysts questioned if Merrill Lynch's premium is too high, considering First Bank's modest growth prospects. "Although pricey, in our view, it does appear to be in line with what Bank of America agreed to pay for U.S. Trust (25 times forward earnings) late last year," Goldman Sachs analyst William Tanona said in a research note. Acquisition of the San Francisco-based regional bank will help Merrill Lynch build up its private banking operations as the ranks of the wealthy have grown. Last year, Merrill Lynch's global wealth management unit generated 35 percent, or $12.1 billion, of the company's total net revenue. "I will be the first to tell you that we are paying a full and a fair price because we believe it is a unique franchise and that we can add value to it over time," said Robert McCann, president of Merrill Lynch's global private client business. Merrill Lynch shares slipped $1.85, or 2 percent, to $92.68 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange. First Republic's stock surged 40 percent to $54.64. Analysts, on average, expect First Republic's earnings per share to increase 4 percent in 2007, according to Reuters Estimates. In contrast, Merrill Lynch's earnings per share are expected to increase 23 percent. Before the deal was announced, First Republic's stock was up about 1 percent in the past year, lagging behind the 10 percent gain on the Standard & Poor's Banks index..15GSPBK Merrill Lynch anticipates that the First Republic deal, expected to be completed in the third quarter, will add modestly to its profits by the end of 2008. First Republic will continue to operate its business separately as a new division of Merrill Lynch Bank & Trust Co., FSB. Chairman and Chief Executive Jim Herbert and President and Chief Operating Officer Katherine August-deWilde will continue in their roles. Merrill Lynch said it wants to boost First Republic's earnings and revenue growth by accelerating the expansion of First Republic's offices and by cross promotions of the two companies' products and services. Standard & Poor's equity analyst Stuart Plesser said in a research report last week that new branch openings should help First Republic's revenue grow 15 percent in 2007. He also said the bank's share price, about a 10 percent premium to peer regional banks, was too high in light of slower growth prospects. "We are concerned about continued net interest margin pressure due to an inverted yield curve and the bank's heavy reliance on borrowed funds," Plesser said. Merrill Lynch is paying 23.7 times First Republic's average earnings estimate for 2007 of $2.32 a share. "It is paying such a high price due to the uniqueness of the First Republic franchise," said Dick Bove, an analyst at Punk Ziegel & Co. As of September 30, 2006, First Republic had assets of $10.7 billion, loans of $7.6 billion, deposits of $7.9 billion, and assets under management or administration of $16.4 billion. In an interview with Reuters last year, John Thiel, head of the private banking and investment group at Merrill Lynch, said the firm had hired hundreds of bankers since 2000, as the ranks of the wealthy have grown. Merrill Lynch's private banking efforts tend to focus on clients with assets of $10 million and more. (Additional reporting by  Dan Wilchins  in New York)
