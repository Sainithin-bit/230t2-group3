 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc. ( VZ.N ) reported a fall in quarterly profit on Monday, as strong growth in its wireless venture was offset by charges from asset sales and spending on its high-speed, fiber optic network. 

 Analysts said Verizon Wireless' fourth-quarter subscriber growth beat expectations and FiOS -- Verizon's new high-speed Internet and video service -- showed solid growth, but the results were already priced into Verizon shares. The stock, which gained 24 percent in 2006, was little changed on the New York Stock Exchange. "The wireless numbers were nothing short of a home run -- spectacular," Stifel Nicolaus analyst Chris King said. But he also said investors were likely concerned about the company's spending on its fiber-optic network to deliver FiOS. FiOS diluted earnings by 10 cents in the fourth quarter, and Verizon forecast it to dilute earnings by 11 cents in the first quarter and around the mid-30 cents range in 2007. Fourth-quarter profit fell to $1 billion, or 35 cents per share, from $ 1.7 billion, or 59 cents per share, a year earlier. The results include charges related to the sale of its Dominican Republic assets and the spin-off of its directories publishing business. "We'll see some ups and downs," Denny Strigl, Verizon's president and chief operating officer, told Reuters. "But success-based dilution is good news in the long run." Most analysts have agreed such investment is necessary, since Verizon, like peers including industry leader AT&T Inc. ( T.N ), was losing traditional phone subscribers to wireless and cable television operators. Fixed-line customers in the fourth quarter fell 7.6 percent from a year earlier, accelerating from a 7.5 percent decline in the third quarter. Income before special items rose to $1.81 billion from $1.78 billion, although it fell to 62 cents a share from 64 cents a share because of a higher number of shares outstanding since the company's merger with MCI, which closed in January 2006. Wall Street on average had expected earnings before items of 61 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Quarterly revenue rose 26 percent to $22.6 billion. EYES ON WIRELESS, FIOS Verizon, like AT&T, has benefited from strong growth in Internet and mobile phone subscribers, which has helped ease the impact of declining fixed-line use. Verizon Wireless, a 55 percent owned joint venture with Vodafone Group Plc ( VOD.L ), added 2.3 million net customers in the fourth quarter, bringing its nationwide total to 59.1 million. That was a 15 percent increase from a year earlier and above the average forecast of 1.93 million additions from 10 analysts polled by Reuters last week. "The wireless numbers were strong. Churn is very low," said Kent Custer, an analyst at A.G. Edwards & Sons. Churn, the industry term for customer cancellations, fell to 1.14 percent in the fourth quarter from 1.24 percent in the third quarter, Verizon said. The company has also been trying to fend off competition from cable companies' all-in-one packages of video, Internet and phone services with FiOS. Verizon said it had 207,000 FiOS TV customers at the year's end, with the service ready for sale to 2.4 million homes. It had 7 million high-speed Internet connections at the end of 2006, up 36 percent from a year earlier. "It's still very small versus the millions of customers cable has, but it's ramping faster than we thought," said John Hodulik, an analyst at UBS. Goldman Sachs analyst Jason Armstrong was slightly more cautious. "FiOS metrics are encouraging and point to long-term health; but the size of the footprint is too small to make a difference to consolidated metrics, while the dilution trajectory still works against investors in the near term," he said in a research note. Verizon had capital expenditures of $17.1 billion on in 2006, and forecast spending $17.5 billion to $17.9 billion in 2007. Armstrong said that was higher than expected, while Verizon's planned share repurchases was lower than expected. The company said it bought back $1.7 billion of stock in 2006, and that it would likely buy the same amount in 2007. Verizon's stock was up 5 cents at $37.88. (Additional reporting by  Sinead Carew )
