 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Dow average and the Nasdaq edged higher on Monday, helped by gains in shares of Intel Corp. ( INTC.O ) and IBM ( IBM.N ) on optimism about new microchip technology. 


 Caution before the Federal Reserve's monetary policy meeting this week limited those gains, while a sell-off in energy shares on a sharp drop in oil prices helped push the Standard & Poor's 500 index lower for the day. Intel, the world's largest chip maker, and IBM announced new technology that they say will be crucial to increasing the power and speed of microchips. Analysts also said Tuesday's wider release of Microsoft Corp.'s ( MSFT.O ) Vista operating system underpinned the broader technology sector's advance in Monday's regular trading session. "The focus is on what's important to the Fed going forward, including the recent strength we've seen in economic data," said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co. in Boston. "If we continue to see strong economic data, there's a better chance the Fed raises interest rates instead of lowering them, and that's contrary to what we are thinking coming into the year." The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  gained 3.76 points, or 0.03 percent, to end at 12,490.78. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  dipped 1.56 points, or 0.11 percent, to finish at 1,420.62. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  rose 5.60 points, or 0.23 percent, to close at 2,441.09. Intel's stock gained 1.8 percent, or 36 cents, to $20.89 and ranked as the No. 1 advancer in the Nasdaq 100. Intel was also among the Dow's biggest gainers, which included International Business Machines Corp., up 1.1 percent, or $1.09, at $98.54 on the New York Stock Exchange, and computer maker Hewlett-Packard Co. ( HPQ.N ), up 1.8 percent, or 73 cents, at $42.42 on the NYSE. In contrast, software maker Microsoft dipped 0.2 percent, or 7 cents, to $30.53 on the Nasdaq. The Fed's Open Market Committee is expected to leave rates unchanged at the end of a two-day meeting on Wednesday. Investors are nervous that policy-makers may signal rates will not fall any time soon, or that they may even hint that the central bank is not done yet with raising rates. ANOTHER MERGER MONDAY Meanwhile, news of mergers and possible deals lifted investor sentiment. Shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. ( BMY.N ) rose 4.7 percent, or $1.22, to $27.43 -- and during the session rose to $28.26, its highest level in nearly three years -- after a report that the U.S. company, known for its cancer-fighting drugs, might be taken over. Merrill Lynch & Co. Inc. MER.N said it will buy First Republic Bank ( FRC.N ) for $1.8 billion.  Merrill Lynch's shares fell 2.3 percent, or $2.14, to $92.39, while First Republic's stock soared 40 percent, or $15.33, to $53.63, both in NYSE trading. First Republic was the Big Board's largest percentage gainer. In other deals, shares of Altiris Inc. ( ATRS.O ) surged 20 percent, or $5.41, to $32.55 on the Nasdaq after Symantec Corp. ( SYMC.O ) said it had agreed to buy the company in a deal worth about $830 million. Symantec shares fell 1.4 percent, or 25 cents, to $17.52, also in Nasdaq trading. EXXON FALLS AS OIL TUMBLES Exxon Mobil Corp. ( XOM.N ) fell 0.6 percent, or 41 cents, to $73.20. The stock was among the biggest drags on the Dow industrials and the S&P 500 as U.S. crude oil for March delivery CLH7 fell $1.41 to settle at $54.01 a barrel. On the Nasdaq, shares of wireless chip developer Qualcomm Inc. ( QCOM.O ) slid 1 percent, or 36 cents, to $37.15 after news that a federal jury in San Diego has said that Broadcom did not infringe two of Qualcomm's patents related to video encoding.  Trading was moderate on the New York Stock Exchange, with about 1.55 billion shares changing hands, below last year's estimated daily average of 1.84 billion, while on Nasdaq, about 1.99 billion shares traded, below last year's daily average of 2.02 billion. Advancing stocks outnumbered declining ones by a ratio of about 6 to 5 on the NYSE and by about 3 to 2 on Nasdaq. (Additional reporting by  Ellis Mnyandu )
