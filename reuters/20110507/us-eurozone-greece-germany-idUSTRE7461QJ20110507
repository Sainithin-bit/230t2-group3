 BERLIN  (Reuters) - A meeting of finance ministers from the euro zone's biggest economies yielded no decisions on how to proceed further with Greece's debt crisis, a German government official told Reuters on Saturday. 

 "That was no extraordinary or emergency meeting," the person said, adding Friday's meeting in Luxembourg was purely informal and as such had no authorisation to take resolutions. Another government source said the meeting had long been planned, and other issues were on the agenda apart from just Greece's problems to successfully implement a package of fiscal reforms. A spokesman for the German finance ministry confirmed that minister Wolfgang Schaeuble and deputy minister Joerg Asmussen represented Berlin in the talks. Greece said on Friday its finance minister George Papaconstantinou was invited to the meeting, which also was attended by European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet and Olli Rehn, the European commissioner for economic and monetary affairs. Jean-Claude Juncker, head of the group of euro zone finance ministers, said on Friday the meeting in Luxembourg was attended by ministers from Germany, France, Italy and Spain. He said there was a broad discussion of Greece and other international economic issues. Juncker denied a report in Germany's Spiegel Online magazine that the talks were held to discuss the possibility, raised by Athens, of Greece withdrawing from the 17-member euro zone, as well as the idea of restructuring Greece's 327 billion euro ($470 billion) sovereign debt. Economists and investors widely believe Athens will need to restructure its debt by forcing creditors, voluntarily or otherwise, to accept a change in repayment terms but so far the government has steadfastly refused this as an option. Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou earlier on Saturday denied there had been even unofficial discussion over Greece quitting the euro zone and asked that his troubled country be "left alone to finish its task. More developments could come in June, when the ECB, the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund will present a report on Greece's progress required before any further tranches of its 110 billion euro rescue package are paid out. So far Greece has received 53 billion of the overall amount received in four separate payments. (Reporting by  Gernot Heller ; writing by  Christiaan Hetzner ; editing by Keiron Henderson)
