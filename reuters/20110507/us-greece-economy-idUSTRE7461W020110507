 ATHENS  (Reuters) - A meeting of top euro zone finance officials in Luxembourg on Friday did not discuss extending the repayment of Greece's bailout loans, or any new bailout deal terms for the country, sources close to the discussion said on Saturday. 

 "There was an extensive debate on Greece's economic adjustment program. The progress made was recognized but it was also recognized that the program has not changed the situation (markets' confidence in Greece) as fast as expected," one source said.
