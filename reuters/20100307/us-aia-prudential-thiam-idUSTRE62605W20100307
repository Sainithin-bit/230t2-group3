 SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - Prudential Plc ( PRU.L ) CEO Tidjane Thiam will attempt to charm leading shareholders on Monday, moving to quell disquiet over the British insurer's $35.5 billion bid for AIA, the Asian arm of American International Group ( AIG.N ), the Financial Times reported on its website. 

 A number of UK investors have expressed concern over the extent and cost of the deal, which will more than double Prudential's size, and some are upset that Thiam flew to Asia last week rather than talking to them in more detail about the AIA deal. Those at the top of the shareholder register say communication has been rudimentary and those apprised of the deal before it was announced say they were informed rather than consulted on the plans. Thiam expects "good, challenging and constructive conversation" with Prudential's core UK investors, he told the Financial Times from Bangkok on the final leg of a three-day tour of staff and regulators in Asia on Friday. "We have clear demand from Asian investors who want to come into the Pru and our U.S. investors are keen," Thiam said. "Of course our UK investors make up the majority of the base and our task ... is to demonstrate the real value of this transaction. "The early discussions have been supportive." Several investors questioned the embedded value accounting methods used to value AIA, the FT said. Some have also questioned Thiam's track record. "There are issues such as his readiness for a transaction of this size," said one unnamed investor. (Writing by Asiadesk; Editing by  Bill Tarrant )
