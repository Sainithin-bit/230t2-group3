 LONDON  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ) ( TM.N ) could freeze new car launches this year if it is not satisfied the accelerator problem that forced a mass recall of its vehicles has been solved, according to the Sunday Telegraph. 

 The report said the European launch of the RAV4 2010 model, the 2010 Auris and the Auris Hybrid, slated for later this year, could be halted, citing comments from the Japanese car maker's European boss. "We are discussing that, if necessary, we will postpone the launch timing. For us there is the hybrid in late May, which is really key. We want to make sure that this car is properly launched without any major issues," Tadashi Arashima, the chief executive of Toyota Motor Europe told the Sunday Telegraph. Arashima added that Toyota was "carefully assessing" the production volumes it will require in Britain during 2010. Toyota was forced to recall 8.5 million cars earlier this year because of braking problems with the Prius hybrid and concerns about sticky accelerator pedals on several other models. Toyota Europe was not immediately available for comment when contacted by Reuters. (Reporting by  Rhys Jones ; Editing by Jon Loades-Carter)
