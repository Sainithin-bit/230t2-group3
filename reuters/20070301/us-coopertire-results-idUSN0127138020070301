 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Cooper Tire and Rubber Co. ( CTB.N ) posted much better-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday on strength in its key North American market, sending its shares up as much as 11 percent. 


 Cooper, which has been restructuring to increase production and materials purchases from lower-cost regions, also said it expects raw materials prices to be more stable in 2007 than they were in 2006. Stripping out charges and a gain from discontinued operations, Cooper earned 33 cents per share in the fourth quarter, while analysts on average expected zero, according to Reuters Estimates. J.P. Morgan analyst Himanshu Patel said in a note that the results were much stronger than he had expected, mainly due to strength in North America, and partly due to inventory related accounting gains and a lower-than-expected tax rate. Cooper "seems to suggest that its cost plans are on target and expect to be completed in 2007," Patel said. The company's net loss widened to $27.6 million, or 45 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, from $6.9 million, or 11 cents per share, a year earlier. Cooper said the write-off of goodwill and intangible assets from acquisitions in North America, plus restructuring charges, totaled 86 cents a share in the quarter. The results included 8 cents a share of income from discontinued operations. Operating profit rose to $28 million in the quarter, from $6 million, a year earlier, driven largely by increased prices and a higher percentage of sales of more profitable tires in North America and Europe, and more efficient North American production, Cooper said. Net sales rose 29.1 percent to $739.1 million, while analysts expected $722.3 million. The revenue increase came mainly from China operations that Cooper took a controlling interest in a year ago. Findlay, Ohio-based Cooper said North American sales rose 12 percent to $585 million, due to higher prices and the sale of a higher percentage of more expensive tires. Operating profit rose to $35 million, from $9 million, a year earlier. Total Cooper light vehicle tire shipments were up 1 percent in the quarter in North America from a year earlier, while the Rubber Manufacturers Association reported that industry light vehicle replacement tire shipments were down 4 percent, Cooper said. Rival Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.'s GT.N North American operations were hit by a United Steelworkers strike for most of the quarter, which cut into tire production and sales. Internationally, sales rose to $177 million, from $66.4 million, a year earlier, but took an operating loss of $5 million because of higher raw materials costs in Europe and start-up costs for the Cooper Kenda joint venture in China. Cooper expects raw materials costs to be lower in the first quarter than they were in the 2006 fourth quarter. Cooper shares were up $1.16, or 7.87 percent at $15.90 Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange after rising as high as $16.40.
