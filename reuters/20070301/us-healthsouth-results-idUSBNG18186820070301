 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - HealthSouth Corp. ( HLS.N ), the biggest operator of rehabilitation centers, posted a smaller quarterly loss on improved pricing in its inpatient hospitals. 


 HealthSouth posted a fourth-quarter net loss of $77.9 million, or 98 cents a share, compared with a net loss of $113.9 million or $1.44 a share, a year earlier. Quarterly revenue fell 0.4 percent to $730.2 million from $733.4 million a year ago. The Birmingham, Alabama-based company said good pricing in its inpatient rehabilitation hospitals helped boost operating earnings in the inpatient unit by 3.2 percent increase, which was offset by revenue declines in its outpatient and diagnostics units. "Trends were mixed on a sequential basis ... We expect a muted reaction," Frank Morgan, an analyst at Jefferies & Co. said in an investor note. HealthSouth is turning itself around after a multi-billion accounting scandal that led to the ouster of its chief executive, a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation, and the restatement of several years of financial results. The company will not be forecasting earnings-per-share for 2007, because of "noise" in its corporate numbers expected to continue into the year, including division sales and settlement payments for several government lawsuits, Chief Executive Jay Grinney said. For its core inpatient division, the company expects 2007 net operating earnings growth wihtin a range of 3 to 4 percent growth. "Once we get through this final transition year," the company will resume forecasting yearly earnings per share, he told analysts on a conference call. The company is in the midst of selling off several divisions to focus solely on its inpatient rehabilitation, and to pay down about $3.3 billion in debt. In January, the company struck a deal to sell its outpatient rehabilitation division to privately held Select Medical Corp. for about $245 million in cash. Also on the block are its surgical and diagnostics units. Deals for the remaining two divisions, which it intends to either sell or spin off, the company has said. Shares fell 3.4 percent, or 81 cents, to $23.15 on the New York Stock Exchange in opening trade. (Additional reporting by  Dhanya Skariachan  in Bangalore)
