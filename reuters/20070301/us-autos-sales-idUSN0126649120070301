 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Chrysler Group, the embattled U.S. unit of DaimlerChrysler AG DCXGn.DE, reported an 8 percent drop in February sales on Thursday, becoming the last of the Detroit automakers to confirm weaker results for the month. 


 General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) said earlier this week its monthly sales would be down 6 percent to 7 percent. Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) said its February sales dropped 13 percent, in line with a forecast it offered earlier. GM -- along with fast-growing Japanese rivals Toyota Motor Corp. ( 7203.T ) and Honda Motor Co. Ltd. ( 7267.T ) -- were scheduled to announce final sales results later on Thursday. Chrysler's reported sales decline for February came as Daimler's luxury brand Mercedes-Benz posted almost flat sales. The results marked the first sales number since Chrysler announced a restructuring plan that will cut 13,000 jobs and Daimler began entertaining bidders for the struggling unit. Analysts expect the auto industry as a whole to report weaker sales numbers for February, continuing a trend that began late last year just as the U.S. manufacturing sector slipped into a broader slowdown. Toyota and Honda were expected to be the only major automakers to escape the downturn for February, drawing buyers with a reputation for high-quality and fuel-efficient vehicles. Inclement winter weather across much of the Midwest and Northeast in February is expected to have played a role in depressing showroom sales in the month. On an annualized basis, Wall Street forecasts for industrywide U.S. auto sales for February had been projected at between 15.8 million and 16.2 million vehicles, sharply below the 16.6 million recorded a year earlier. A number at the lower end of that range, if sustained in coming months, would represent the lowest annual sales trend since 1998 and could force further wrenching production cutbacks by the Detroit based automakers. GM, Ford and Chrysler have all said they expect to see a flat or only slightly weaker market this year compared with 2006 when the industry sold a combined 16.6 million light vehicles. GM and Ford, which are also restructuring their North American operations, have announced plans to reduce low-margin sales to car rental companies this year. Earlier this week, both automakers said those planned fleet sales reduction played an important role in their overall decline in sales for February. Sales incentives offered to U.S. new-car buyers declined in February despite steeper discounting by Ford. Edmunds.com, an auto industry-tracking Web site, said the average manufacturer incentive on cars and light trucks sold in the United States was $2,253 in February, down 4 percent from a year earlier. Sales incentives are widely tracked as an indication of the relative profitability of various automakers and the pressure they face to move inventory. On an industry-wide basis, the total sales discounts amounted to $2.7 billion for February with the U.S. automakers accounting for 70 percent of that total, Edmunds said.
