 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. pork producer Smithfield Foods Inc. SFD.N said on Thursday that quarterly profits declined because high feed prices hurt results in its hog production unit. 


 The company said it earned $60.4 million, or 54 cents per diluted share, for the quarter that ended January 28, down from $71 million, or 63 cents per diluted share, a year earlier. The company said in February it expected earnings of 53 to 56 cents per share. Analysts, on average, had been expecting the company to earn 55 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. "Given the adverse conditions in hog production and cattle feeding, I am reasonably satisfied with our third-quarter results," Chief Executive C. Larry Pope said in a statement. Sales rose to $3.3 billion from $2.9 billion a year ago. Smithfield, like other livestock producers, has seen hog production costs skyrocket due to higher corn prices. The company had said previously that consumers can expect to pay more for meat as it passes on those higher costs. "Looking forward, the recent rise in the price of corn, as well as other grain costs, will have a significant impact on our business," Pope said, adding that corn prices in the range of $4 per bushel were likely to remain for some time. The company has the nation's largest hog herd and sells about 14 million hogs a year. Smithfield has become a major meat producer both here and abroad due to a string of acquisitions. Last year it bought the refrigerated meats unit from ConAgra Foods Inc. ( CAG.N ) and with a partner it bought the European meat operations of Sara Lee Inc. SLE.N It expects to soon complete the purchase of U.S. hog and pork producer Premium Standard Farms Inc.
