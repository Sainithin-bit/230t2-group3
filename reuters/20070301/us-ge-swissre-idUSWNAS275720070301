 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - General Electric Co. ( GE.N ) backed its first-quarter and full-year earnings forecasts on Thursday and said it expects a $565 million pretax gain from divesting a 33.3 million share stake in Swiss RE RUKN.VX.

Analysts on average expect GE to earn 44 cents per share for the first quarter and $2.22 per share for 2007, according to Reuters Estimates.
