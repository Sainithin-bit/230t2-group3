 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Bacteria linked to contaminated peanut butter that has sickened hundreds of people has been traced to a plant owned by ConAgra Foods Inc. where it was made, U.S. health regulators said on Thursday. 


 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said it discovered the salmonella bacteria during an inspection of the now shuttered plant in Sylvester, Georgia that made Peter Pan brand peanut butter and the Great Value brand sold by Wal-Mart Inc. "The fact that FDA found Salmonella in the plant environment further suggests that the contamination likely took place prior to the product reaching consumers," the agency said. FDA officials have warned consumers to avoid Peter Pan peanut butter bought since last May as well as any Great Value brand with lot number 2111 on the lid. The contaminated products have sickened 370 people from 42 states and sent 60 of them to hospitals since last August, according to the latest count on February 27 by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). About 40,000 U.S. cases of salmonellosis are reported each year and about 600 people die of it, the CDC has estimated. The bacteria infection can cause abdominal cramps, diarrhea and fever. While it can usually be treated with antibiotics and hydration, it can cause a small number of people to develop Reiter's syndrome that leads to painful joints and urination complications. Although FDA tests had already confirmed salmonella in the peanut butter, the FDA has traced the contamination to the manufacturing plant. "We assumed this would be the case based on last week's news of confirmed findings in some test samples," ConAgra spokesman Chris Kircher told Reuters. "Now that the product is off the shelf, we're focused on completing our work with the FDA as an initial step in solving this problem." He said the company does plan to remain in the peanut butter business. ConAgra's Georgia plant is the only one that makes the peanut butter in question and has been closed since February 16. Last week, China's Ministry of Health warned consumers not to eat ay imported U.S. peanut butter carrying the Peter Pan or Great Value brands. The company's chief executive, Gary Rodkin, said last week that production was unlikely to resume until sometime in its next fiscal year, which begins at the end of May. He added ConAgra had already been planning to replace the equipment in the plant as part of a manufacturing upgrade. The salmonella found by the FDA in the plant matched the outbreak strain from peanut butter samples recovered from people who fell ill, the FDA said. The agency also said ConAgra had sent Peter Pan peanut butter to its Humboldt, Tennessee plant for use in ice cream and related toppings for such brands as Carvel and Sonic. While those related products have already been recalled, officials warned consumers they may still have some of the products in their home. A list of those products were posted on the FDA's site  here Shares of ConAgra closed down 9 cents at $25.14, while shares of Wal-Mart finished down 41 cents at $47.89.
