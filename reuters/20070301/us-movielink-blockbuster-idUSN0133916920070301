 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Movie-rental company Blockbuster Inc. BBI.N is in advanced talks to acquire Movielink LLC, an online movie-downloading company owned by the major Hollywood studios, the Wall Street Journal said on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter. 


 The  price was said to be less than $50 million in cash and stock but the deal would give Blockbuster a quick way into the online downloads business and bring much-needed marketing muscle to Movielink's efforts to increase market share now that big players like Apple Inc.'s ( AAPL.O ) iTunes and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) have jumped into the fray, the paper said. Movielink is owned by a joint venture of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, Paramount Pictures VIA.N, Sony Pictures Entertainment ( 6758.T ), Universal Studios ( VIV.PA ) and Warner Bros. ( TWX.N ) No one at Blockbuster or Movielink could immediately be reached for comment.
