 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) said on Thursday that U.S. sales rose 3.4 percent in February, driven by an increase in retail sales, but set its target for second-quarter production 5 percent lower than a year ago. 


 The world's largest automaker said it sold 311,763 vehicles in the United States last month, up from 301,545 vehicles a year earlier. An 11-percent increase in sales to showrooms offset an 18-percent reduction in fleet sales to daily rental companies, leading to GM's first monthly sales increase since November 2006. GM set its second-quarter production forecast at 1.175 million units to align capacity with demand and due to reduced rental sales.
