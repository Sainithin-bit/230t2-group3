 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - SLM Corp. SLM.N, better known as 
Sallie Mae, said on Thursday it restated nearly three years of 
financial statements because of several errors in its statement 
of cash flows. 


  The largest U.S. student loan company said its current 
annual report, filed Thursday, contains a restatement of its 
2004 and 2005 financial statements and its cash flow statements 
for the first three quarters of 2006. It said investors should 
no longer rely on the earlier financials.  Reston, Virginia-based Sallie Mae said the errors mainly 
concerned classifications related to restricted cash accounts 
involving on-balance-sheet securitizations. It said the changes 
should have been classified in the investing section of the 
cash flow statements rather than the operating section.  Sallie Mae said the restatement does not affect reported 
net income or cash stakes.
