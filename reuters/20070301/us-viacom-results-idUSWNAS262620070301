 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Viacom Inc. VIAb.N said on Thursday its fourth quarter profit rose helped by the purchase of Dreamworks compared with a year ago when profit was dragged by charges. 


 The owners of the Paramount film studio and Nickelodeon posted a fourth quarter net profit of $480.8 million, or 69 cents per share, compared to $129.5 million, or 17 cents per share a year earlier. Revenue rose 32 percent to $3.59 billion. Wall Street expected the company to post a profit of 59 cents per share and revenue of $3.16 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.
