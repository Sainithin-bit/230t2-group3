 (Reuters) - The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said Lenovo Inc. ( 0992.HK ) and Sanyo Electric Co. Ltd. 6764.T are voluntarily recalling about 100,000 packs of Lithium-ion batteries used in ThinkPad notebook computers. 


 The move comes after Lenovo received four reports of the batteries getting overheated and damaging the notebook, the commission said in a statement. However, the commission said the recall is not because of an internal battery cell defect. (Reporting by Anup Roy in Bangalore)
