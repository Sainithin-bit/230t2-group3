 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Del Monte Foods Co. DLM.N posted lower quarterly profit on Thursday due to rising ingredient costs and weak consumer demand for branded food and pet products. 


 Net profit for the quarter fell to $46.5 million, or 23 cents per share, from $51.9 million, or 26 cents, in the year-ago quarter. Excluding discontinued operations, the company posted a profit of 22 cents per share. Analysts, on average, had been expecting the owner of StarKist and 9Lives brands to post earnings of 22 cents per share, excluding items, according to Reuters Estimates. Net sales for the third fiscal quarter ended January 28 were up 15 percent to $907.2 million, compared to $789.6 million a year earlier. The increase was driven by the acquisition of pet brands Meow Mix and Milk-Bone, the company said. These acquisitions and new product growth helped the company "mitigate ongoing inflationary cost pressures and are enhancing the long-terms earnings performance potential of our company," Chief Executive Richard Wolford said in a statement. Earnings from continuing operations were flat compared to the previous year, including several charges that totaled 4 cents per share. Net sales of consumer products such as StarKist seafood fell 2 percent to $551 million, compared to $562.3 million a year earlier, the company said. It said higher fruit and fish prices and lower volume contributed to the dip. For the fourth quarter, the company expects to deliver between 13 percent to 15 percent sales growth, and earnings per share from continuing operations of 13 cents to 16 cents, including transformation-related and other expenses.
