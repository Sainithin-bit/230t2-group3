 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Del Monte Foods Co. DLM.N reported a 5.4 percent decline in third-quarter profit on Thursday, hurt by rising ingredient costs and weak consumer demand for its branded food products. 


 Increases in the costs of tomatoes, peaches and tuna and in packaging costs will continue to offset gains from price increases and acquisitions in its pet products division, Chief Executive Richard Wolford said during a conference call. "The same factors in the third quarter are expected to impact fourth-quarter operating income and offset realizations from pricing and acquisitions," Wolford said. Del Monte shares were slightly lower in midday trade. Net profit to $46.5 million, or 23 cents per share, for the third fiscal quarter ended January 28 from $51.9 million, or 26 cents, in the year-ago quarter. Excluding discontinued operations, the owner of StarKist and 9Lives cat food brands posted a profit of 22 cents per share, compared with an average forecast of 22 cents excluding items, according to Reuters Estimates. Net sales were up 15 percent to $907.2 million, driven by the acquisition of pet brands Meow Mix and Milk-Bone and growth from new pet products such as Pup-Peroni Ribs, the company said. However, these gains were partially offset by volume declines in consumer products and higher marketing and interest expense. GUIDANCE Earnings from continuing operations were flat including charges that totaled 4 cents per share. The company narrowed its guidance for earnings per share from continuing operations to 50 to 53 cents for fiscal 2007, compared with earlier guidance of 48 to 53 cents. It attributed the revision to lower-than-expected charges. Net sales of consumer products such as StarKist seafood and Del Monte packaged fruit fell 2 percent to $551 million, due in part to the higher fruit and fish prices and a short supply of fruit, the company said. For the fourth quarter, the company expects to deliver sales growth of between 13 to 15 percent sales and earnings per share from continuing operations of 13 cents to 16 cents, including transformation-related and other expenses. Deutsche Bank Securities analyst Eric Katzmann said in a research note that competition from other brands, rising energy and ingredient costs and the pressures of integration from recent acquisitions remain the main risks for Del Monte going forward. He affirmed his 'hold' rating on the stock. Shares of the San Francisco, California-based company were down 8 cents to $11.42 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has traded between $9.90 and $12.17 over the past 52 weeks.
