 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) posted an unexpected rise in February sales on Thursday, bucking a slump that pulled monthly U.S. auto sales lower for its struggling Detroit-based rivals, while Japan's Toyota made further market inroads. 


 GM's 3 percent year-on-year sales gain marked the first monthly improvement for the world's largest automaker since November. Toyota Motor Co. ( 7203.T ), the second-largest and fastest growing automaker in the U.S. market, posted a 12-percent gain in sales on the strength of a fuel-efficient line-up including its hybrid Prius. But GM's improved performance, driven by stronger sales of its profitable truck and sport utility vehicle line-up, came as the biggest surprise given concern about the U.S. economy and the spillover from a weak housing market and tighter lending. Wall Street analysts and GM had forecast a sales decline of the kind that hit GM's Detroit-based rivals. Chrysler Group, the embattled U.S. unit of DaimlerChrysler AG DCXGn.DE, reported an 8 percent drop in sales. Ford Motor Co's ( F.N ) sales were off 13 percent, in line with its own cautionary forecast. Other Japanese automakers had a positive month, although they lagged Toyota. Honda Motor Co's ( 7267.T ) sales rose 3 percent Nissan Motor Co's ( 7201.T ) monthly sales were up 1 percent. GM, which offered zero-percent financing on some vehicles in a February sale, saw showroom sales rise 11 percent in the month, more than offsetting an 18-percent drop in lower-margin sales to fleet operators, including car rental agencies. "The bottom line for us is the overall February performance was very solid. A bit above expectations, certainly on the retail side," said GM's chief sales analyst Paul Ballew. "We feel that in a market that is below trend ... that we're hitting our marks." Shares in GM, down before the release of its sales data, reached positive territory for a time but closed Thursday down 1.2 percent to $31.54 on the New York Stock Exchange. Chrysler's sales decline was the first monthly result since the struggling automaker announced a restructuring plan that will cut 13,000 jobs in an effort to restore the company to profitability by 2008. Potential bidders, including private equity firms, have begun to size up Chrysler for a potential acquisition after Daimler said last month it was leaving all options open for the unit, which represents the Dodge, Jeep and Chrysler brands. Analysts had expected the auto industry as a whole to post weaker sales numbers for February, continuing a trend that began late last year just as the U.S. manufacturing sector slipped into a broader slowdown. On an annualized basis, Wall Street forecasts for overall U.S. auto sales for February had been projected at between 15.8 million and 16.2 million vehicles, sharply below the 16.6 million recorded a year earlier. But GM's Ballew said the overall market appeared set for an almost flat result compared with a year earlier. FORD, GM SET LOWER PRODUCTION TARGETS Ford, which is counting on its ability to hold its U.S. market share near 14 percent as it shutters plants and sheds capacity this year, set a sharply lower production target for the second quarter. The No. 3 U.S. automaker said it would build 770,000 vehicles in the June-ending quarter, down 14 percent from a year earlier. GM also set a lower second-quarter production target, saying it planned to make 1.175 million vehicles, down 5 percent from a year before. In the pickup truck market, a key segment for both U.S. automakers, GM beat Ford by a wide margin. Sales of Ford's F-Series pickup trucks, the segment's top-selling model, dropped 12 percent in February. GM, meanwhile, saw double-digit gains for its newer Silverado and GMC Sierra models. Overall, GM's full-size pickup trucks gained 36 percent. The slowdown in the U.S housing market has hit the full-size pickup truck market especially hard because many contractors have delayed purchases, according to analysts. Ford's sales analyst George Pipas attributed the lower F-Series sales to the weaker economy, saying the No. 2 automaker would be in position to raise production in the second half if the housing market steadied or interest rates eased. "My feeling is that our sales are going to be what our sales are going to be given that we've got some underlying weakness in the economy," he told analysts and reporters. But Ford also faces new competition in the segment from Toyota, which began selling its all-new Tundra pickup last month. Toyota's pickup truck sales were up just under 2 percent in February. The Japanese automaker has called the new truck, which is priced above the comparable U.S. offerings, the most important product launch in its history.
