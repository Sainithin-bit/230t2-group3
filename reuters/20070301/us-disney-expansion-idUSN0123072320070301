 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co. ( DIS.N ) on Thursday said it was planning two big expansions to its Walt Disney World theme park in Florida, including a 900-acre luxury resort and a commercial district outside the gateway entrance. 


 In a statement, Disney said the luxury resort would be anchored by a Four Seasons hotel FSH.TO FS.N and would include an 18-hole golf course and vacation homes. Work on the luxury resort could begin this year, and the hotel is forecast to open in 2010. It will be located along the northeast border of Walt Disney World on the current site of the Eagle Pines and Osprey Ridge golf courses. In addition, on the western edge of the park, Disney said it would build a pedestrian-friendly development with hotels, stores and restaurants. That project, which is in the design stage, will be comparable in size to Disney's Animal Kingdom. The development, which will center around a retail village, will be built in phases over 8 to 10 years, Disney said. Disney shares were up 13 cents, or 0.38 percent, at $34.39 in mid-day trade Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange.
