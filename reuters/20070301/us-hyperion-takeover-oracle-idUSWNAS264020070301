 SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oracle Corp. ORCL.O said on Thursday it would buy Hyperion Solutions Corp. HYSL.O for $3.3 billion to boost its position in the fast-growing market for tools to help executives analyze business performance. 


 Oracle, which has a market value of more than $80 billion, will pay $52 in cash for each Hyperion share, a 21 percent premium over Wednesday's closing price of $42.84. The deal marks the latest in a steady stream of takeovers for Oracle as it seeks to surpass SAP AG ( SAPG.DE ) of Germany in the market for business software that help companies manage everything from human resources to accounting to supply chains. Oracle has spent more than $20 billion over the past two years on acquisitions of companies such as Siebel and PeopleSoft in search of growth as its core database software market matures. Oracle is the world's biggest database software maker and generates most of its revenue from those products. Shares of Hyperion rose 20 percent to $51.60 on the Nasdaq, where Oracle shares jumped 3 percent to $16.92. Analysts viewed the price as reasonable and said Oracle's deal -- while not surprising -- could potentially pressure rivals IBM ( IBM.N ) and SAP to make a counter move for Cognos CSN.TO and Business Objects BOBJ.PA BOBJ.O . Hyperion competes with Business Objects and Cognos in the broad market for business intelligence software that helps companies sift through data to detect trends and other information. "It is going to increase the chances that SAP or IBM feels compelled to make a similar acquisition," said Pat Walravens, an analyst at JMP Securities. Hyperion supplies analytical software that culls through volumes of corporate data to help executive decision-makers uncover underlying trends about a company's business performance. Oracle said Hyperion, which reported revenue of $222.9 million in its most recent quarterly report, has more than 12,000 customers including 91 of the Fortune 100 companies. Business intelligence is one of the fastest-growing parts of the software market and Oracle had long been rumored to be looking for an acquisition in this space, though the speculation had often focused on Business Objects. Business Objects stock fell about 2 percent, a decline some analysts attributed to the fact investors were banking on Oracle doing a deal for that company instead of Hyperion. But Brendan Barnacle, an analyst at Pacific Crest Equities, did not rule out a potential Oracle bid for Business Objects, because he said it would give the software maker an even better set of tools to attract customers. "I wouldn't rule out that they still wouldn't come back for Business Objects," he said. "They never admit they need anything, and it would give them query and reporting tools that are better than what they have now." Oracle's price for Hyperion was reasonable, he added. Oracle Chief Financial Officer Safra Catz said the combination with Hyperion would create savings and boost sales for both businesses. The deal would be "modestly dilutive" in fiscal year 2008 on a generally accepted accounting principle (GAAP) basis, but would add to earnings in the following years. Excluding certain items, Catz said the deal would add at least 1 cent per share to fiscal 2008 earnings and at least 4 cents a share in 2009. "We do expect to sell quite a bit more together than we do currently once we're in full speed and not in transition," Catz said on a conference call with analysts. Catz said the deal would contribute to Oracle's long-term goal of 20 percent annual earnings growth. Hyperion Chief Executive Godfrey Sullivan said the deal would not affect his company's customers. "We're confident our customers will see their investments protected and extended by Oracle," Sullivan said. Oracle's aggressive acquisition strategy has fueled speculation of other possible deals it could pursue. In January, rumors that Oracle would target Germany's SAP ( SAPG.DE ) boosted the stock price of the world's biggest maker of business software. Bernstein analyst Charles Di Bona said it made sense for Oracle to expand its software expertise. "The purchase of technology they don't have often makes sense for a software company," he said. Oracle expects the Hyperion deal, which is subject to regulatory review, to close around the middle of April. (Additional reporting by  Sinead Carew  in New York)
