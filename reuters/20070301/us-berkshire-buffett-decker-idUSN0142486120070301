 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. ( BRKa.N ) ( BRKb.N ) on Thursday said Susan Decker, the chief financial officer of Internet media company Yahoo Inc. ( YHOO.O ), will join its board of directors. 


 The appointment is effective at Omaha, Nebraska,-based Berkshire's May 5 annual meeting, Buffett said in his annual letter to Berkshire shareholders. Decker will replace Malcolm Chace, who has been on the 11-person board since 1992. Buffett said Decker fulfills his requirements that board members be "owner-oriented, business-savvy, interested and truly independent." He also said her age, 44, was a plus. "(She) is young -- an attribute, as you may have noticed, that your chairman has long lacked," said Buffett, who is 76. "We will seek more young directors in the future." In December, Yahoo gave Decker additional responsibility over a new unit focused on advertising, Yahoo's main source of income. The new role was part of a reorganization that may have bolstered Decker's chances of eventually succeeding Terry Semel as Yahoo's chief executive. Decker is the latest executive from a technology-oriented company to join Berkshire's board. Others include Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT.O ) Chairman Bill Gates and Level 3 Communications Inc. LVLT.O Chairman Walter Scott. "He appears to be building some institutional knowledge about technology companies onto Berkshire's board, figuring that in 10 to 15 years technology will be much more important to Berkshire, and a place the company might start moving toward," said Morningstar Inc. analyst Justin Fuller. Buffett owns more than 50 companies, but generally gets more than half of the profit from insurance and reinsurance. Chace's grandfather, also named Malcolm Chace, was a key figure in 1929 in merging four New England textile units into Berkshire Fine Spinning Associates, which merged in 1955 with Hathaway Manufacturing to form Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett said. Buffett took control of the combined company in 1965.
