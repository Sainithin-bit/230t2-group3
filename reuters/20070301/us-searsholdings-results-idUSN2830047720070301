 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Sears Holdings Corp. ( SHLD.O ) reported higher fourth-quarter profit on Thursday, helped by property sales and higher operating income at its Sears and Kmart divisions. 


 The company's chairman, hedge fund manager Edward Lampert, said in a letter to shareholders published on the company's Web site that he intended to grow, not shrink, the retailer, and said using existing assets, as opposed to opening new stores, was the best way to deliver value in the near term. Net income for the Hoffman Estates, Illinois, company came to $820 million, or $5.33 a share, for the fourth quarter ended February 3, from $648 million, or $4.03 a share, a year earlier. Results included various special items, including an 11 cent-a-share loss tied to swap investments; a 20-cent-a-share gain on sale of assets, and a tax benefit of 17 cents a share. Quarterly sales rose 1 percent to $16.3 billion, helped by an extra week. The company said sales at stores open at least a year fell 3.1 percent overall, with Sears' U.S. stores declining 4.9 percent and Kmart same-store sales off 0.9 percent. At Sears, same-store sales fell across most categories, but the company noted increases in women's apparel. At Kmart, declines in a number of categories were offset by rises in apparel and pharmacy. Sears, which announced the departure of its finance chief in January, cited improved margin performance at its stores. In his letter, Lampert said he intended to grow Sears Holdings. "Some commentators have asserted that we want to shrink the company, but that is simply not so," Lampert wrote. He also said the company ended 2006 with more cash on hand than debt, and expressed a belief that Sears was an investment-grade company despite no upgrades from ratings agencies. He also said the Kmart business was becoming more stable but said the company lagged behind key competitors on metrics such as margin, sales and profit per square foot.
