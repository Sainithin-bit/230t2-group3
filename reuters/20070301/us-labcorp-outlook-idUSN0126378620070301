 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings ( LH.N ) on Thursday cut its 2007 earnings forecast after Aetna Inc. ( AET.N ) terminated its LabCorp contract, sending shares in the diagnostic services company down by as much as 11 percent. 


 LabCorp, the second-largest provider of diagnostic tests, said the loss of the contract would likely reduce 2007 earnings by about 4 cents to 12 cents a share. Shortly after the announcement, larger rival Quest Diagnostics Inc. ( DGX.N ) said it had struck a deal to be No. 3 U.S. health insurer Aetna's preferred provider for five years, starting July 1. Shares of LabCorp tumbled $8.40 to $71.35 in midday New York Stock Exchange trade after trading a low as $70.65 earlier in the session. Quest shares rose 15 cents or 0.29 percent to $51.17 after falling nearly 3 percent earlier in the session. Aetna's decision to change providers is part of a larger effort by insurers to trim costs without impacting the health services they offer, said Allen Karp, vice president of healthcare delivery for Aetna. "This is an area where we can look at the total costs and use our leverage and size to drive better prices," Karp told Reuters. Aetna's termination of the LabCorp contract follows recent efforts by UnitedHealth ( UNH.N ) and Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield in New Jersey to renegotiate their own lab vendor relationships. Merrill Lynch analyst Doug Simpson said insurers are benefiting from an increasingly competitive market for lab services. "We expect the large publicly traded managed care organizations to continue reviewing their alternatives and look to improve the terms of their lab contracts," he said. As insurers focus on reining in costs for their customers, lab services are a relatively easy target, Simpson said. The top U.S. health insurers by membership are WellPoint Inc. ( WLP.N ), UnitedHealth and Aetna. LabCorp Chief Executive David King told Reuters in an interview two weeks ago he aimed to capture 10 percent of the market for diagnostic testing after winning a major contract with UnitedHealth from Quest. The U.S. market for such services is estimated at nearly $50 billion. Bank of America analyst Robert Willoughby said news of Aetna's decision "can only mean Quest has succeeded in capturing a more exclusive relationship with the payer." "While the economics of the relationship aren't crystal clear, we are boosting our revenue forecast for 2007 by roughly $50 million and maintaining our current (earnings per share) estimate of $3, which is at the high end of (Quest's) management's guidance range," he said.
