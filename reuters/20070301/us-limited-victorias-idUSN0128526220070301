 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Limited Brands Inc.'s ( LTD.N ) strategic changes, such as enlarging Victoria's Secret stores, are not expected to boost profitability in 2007 but should begin contributing to profitability in 2008, the company's chief financial officer said on Thursday. 


 Limited plans to start increasing the square footage of the average Victoria's Secret store by about 50 percent this year, CFO Martyn Redgrave said during the company's quarterly conference call. He also said that the company plans to continue closing underproductive apparel stores and converting its Express stores to offer clothing for both men and women. Redgrave said that the company plans to open 35 new Victoria's Secret stores and remodel another 105 stores to the new larger store size during 2007.
