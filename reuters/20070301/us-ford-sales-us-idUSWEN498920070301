 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) on Thursday said U.S. February vehicle sales fell 13 percent from a year earlier because of planned reduction of sales to daily-rental companies. 


 The company said sales to car rental firms last month were 30 percent lower than a year ago. The second-largest U.S. automaker said it sold 211,150 vehicles in the United States last month, compared with 244,021 vehicles a year earlier. Results for Ford include its import brands and some medium- and heavy-duty trucks.
