 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Staples Inc. ( SPLS.O ), the world's largest office supplies retailer, reported on Thursday a 21.5-percent rise in quarterly profit, driven by increased demand for its private label items and higher North American retail sales. 


 Staples said its fourth-quarter net income rose to $336.5 million, or 46 cents a share, from $277 million, or 37 cents a share, a year earlier. The current year had an extra week. Quarterly sales rose 18 percent to $5.3 billion from $4.5 billion as North American retail revenue increased 14 percent. Staples said sales of its private label items represented 20 percent of total sales for the year. But Staples' shares fell nearly 5 percent in early Nasdaq trading due to investor concerns about Staples' 1 percent growth in quarterly comparable store sales in North America, Lehman Brothers analyst Brad Thomas told Reuters. "The good news is it appears to not be an issue of the competitive environment, but more of an issue of the weakness in a few particular categories. Technology and furniture came in weak," said Thomas, who has an "overweight" rating on Staples' shares. Analysts, on average, were expecting Staples to earn 45 cents a share for the quarter on revenue of about $5.2 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. The Framingham, Massachusetts-based company said North American delivery sales rose 24 percent. For the first quarter, Staples said it expects earnings to grow between 15 percent and 20 percent and said it sees a "low single-digit" comparable-store sales increase in its North American retail segment. "They had a decent quarter and the outlook's good," said Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Colin McGranahan, who has an "outperform" rating on Staples' shares. Staples, which opened 99 stores in 2006, also said it expects 2007 earnings to range between $1.43 and $1.49 a share, helped by "low double-digit" growth in total sales. Analysts, on average, expect first-quarter earnings of 30 cents a share on revenue of $4.7 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Staples also raised its dividend 32 percent, to 29 cents a share. During the fourth quarter, the company entered a joint venture in India with Pantaloon Retail Ltd. and its office products business called Future Office. It also said it plans to buy Pei Pei, an office product chain near Shanghai. Staples shares trade at 20.3 times 2007 earnings, a premium to smaller rivals Office Depot Inc. ( ODP.N ) and OfficeMax Inc. OMX.N, which trade at 14.5 times and 19.6 times, respectively. Staples' stock, which has risen about 19 percent from a 52-week low of $21.08 on August 1, was down 2.6 percent to $25.35 a share in early afternoon trading on Nasdaq.
