 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Welcome to the dawn of a new credit cycle, with tighter bank lending, rising costs for riskier borrowers and a slowing economy. 


 That's the message from three of the biggest names in U.S. bond investing, Bill Gross, Dan Fuss and Jeffrey Gundlach. The trio have made big bets on U.S. government bonds and expect a tightening in financial and economic conditions will likely force the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates by the middle of the year, if not sooner. "The linear uptrend in risk-taking was broken this week," said Gundlach, chief investment officer at the TCW Group in Los Angeles, which manages assets worth $145 billion. "We are sitting here at our biggest Treasury position in 10 years. We are double the market weighting in Treasuries." After three years of abundant liquidity and muted volatility, this week's plunge in stocks and lower-rated debt have triggered a sudden pullback in risk-taking. Indeed, punctuating that pullback is the unwinding of the global carry trade by leveraged players. For the better part of this decade, investors have borrowed in low-yielding Japanese yen to buy high-yielding emerging market stocks, bonds and currencies. As investors undo their carry positions, the yen has risen about 3 percent this week, while emerging market currencies were broadly down. "When you get an upset as big as this in the so-called carry trade, you will see an initial cutback in risk appetite in various markets," added Fuss, co-manager of the $8.7 billion Loomis Sayles Bond Fund. "This week's events were very significant and have led to a change in psychology." The break in risk appetite not only goes for financial markets, but the economy as well. This week, Freddie Mac FRE.N, the second-biggest provider of money for U.S. home loans, said it will no longer buy subprime mortgages that are most sensitive to increases in interest rates and have the highest likelihood of foreclosure. Other companies and originators are expected to follow suit. "As credit availability is being restricted -- Freddie Mac and banks with subprime lending -- and the cost of credit in risk markets goes up, an inevitable slowdown in the U.S. and global economy will take place," Gross, chief investment officer at Pacific Investment Management Co., told Reuters. "That ultimately leads to the Fed cutting rates, perhaps as early as June of this year." BANKING ON BONDS - AND THE FED Gross, who manages the $101 billion PIMCO Total Return Fund, said the firm has a huge emphasis on the short end of the Treasury curve, particularly Eurodollar futures maturing between 12 and 18 months. Since the subprime bombshell in mid-February, investors have sought safety in Treasuries, helping bonds end a two-month skid. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries closed out February with their best monthly performance in half a year, and shorter-duration two-year notes did even better, notching their best month in three-and-a-half years. Investors are shifting their expectations for when the Fed will cut benchmark interest rates, prompted by deepening fears that rising defaults in subprime and the jump in the cost of credit in risk markets could slow economic growth. By Thursday, short-term U.S. interest rate futures were showing a roughly 58 percent chance of a 25 basis point cut in the U.S fed funds rate in June. The policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee has kept the overnight fed-funds rate target at 5.25 percent, the level it reached in mid-2006 after 17 straight increases since mid-2004. Gross, who was burned late last year by forecasting a Fed rate cut too early, is as convinced as ever that the Fed will have to act before long. He reasserted his view that the economy cannot withstand significantly higher rates as it is largely finance-based, with the housing sector at its epicenter. Now mounting tightening in economic and financial conditions threaten that support. Fuss said U.S. policy makers could be forced to slash short-term interest rates to 4.50 percent fed funds rate by mid-2007. "It is thin odds that the Fed will cut in March, but they should," said Fuss. "The economy is still growing but slowing, and it was slowing before all of this," he said, referring to the subprime and credit-market events. "You have to ask: Where will the growth come from?"
