 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The New York Stock Exchange said on Thursday it instituted downside trading curbs as U.S. stocks fell sharply in early trading. 


 The U.S. market's fall followed a sharp sell-off in equities on Tuesday. On Thursday, renewed inflation worries and a rise in the yen stirred concern that investors were being forced to unwind carry trades. The New York Stock Exchange Composite Index  .NYA , which is used to determine when to begin trading curbs, was down 159.75 points, or 1.8 percent, at 8964.79. The trading curbs require that all program selling of S&P 500 stocks must be on an up-tick.
