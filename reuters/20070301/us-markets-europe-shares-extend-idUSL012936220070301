 LONDON  (Reuters) - European shares followed U.S. stock futures lower on Thursday as the strength of the yen fueled worries over unwinding of the carry trade in that currency. 


 The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 1.1 percent at 1,465.48 points, its lowest point in the day. U.S. stock futures for the main indexes were down 0.6 percent as the yen rallied to 117.61 against the dollar and 155.44 against the euro. Investors are worried that this will hit the carry trade, which features borrowing low-yielding yen to invest in higher-yielding assets.
