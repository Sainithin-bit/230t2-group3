 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda picked a relatively inexperienced party official, Jun Azumi, as his new finance minister. 

 Following are key facts about Azumi: - As the ruling Democratic Party of Japan's (DPJ) parliamentary affairs chief he struggled to win cooperation from the opposition, which controls the upper house in a divided parliament while the Democrats control the more powerful lower house. - Azumi led the DPJ campaign in the upper house election in 2010 that the Democrats lost badly. - He told domestic media in August that the only way for the DPJ to stay in power was to retain a dialogue with the two main opposition parties, the Liberal Democratic Party and the New Komeito Party. - He has held a parliamentary seat for five terms; his political career includes a stint as senior vice minister of defense. - The 49 year old graduated from the School of Social Sciences at Waseda University, considered one of the top private universities in Japan. - After graduating from Waseda he joined public broadcaster NHK as an announcer. - He is from Ishinomaki, in Miyagi prefecture in northeast Japan, one of the cities hit hardest by the catastrophic earthquake and tsunami in March, which destroyed his family home. - He is a fan of the Hanshin Tigers, a baseball team from the Osaka area in western Japan known to draw fanatical devotion from its supporters.
