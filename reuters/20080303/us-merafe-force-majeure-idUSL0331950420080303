 JOHANNESBURG  (Reuters) - South Africa's Merafe Resources Ltd ( MRFJ.J ) said on Monday it declared force majeure on ferrochrome production at its chrome venture with Xstrata Plc XTA.L due to the country's power crisis. 

 "The venture has declared a force majeure with its customers as a precautionary measure should the venture be unable to supply the required quantities of ferrochrome due to the reduction in the operation's electricity supply," Merafe said in a statement. The venture has a total managed capacity of 1.96 million tons of ferrochrome production a year. A shortage of electricity as state utility Eskom ESCJ.UL grapples with rising demand has forced producers to partially close mines and put jobs at risk. Miners have been restricted to 90 percent of the electricity they would normally need, hurting production and helping push metal prices to record highs. Merafe said the outlook for ferrochrome prices in 2008 was positive, with demand forecast to rise about 9 percent. But supply-side constraints on South African producers because of the power outages and rations are expected to result in a supply deficit this year.
