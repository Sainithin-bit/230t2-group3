 (Reuters) - Australian miner Oxiana Ltd OXR.AX launched an agreed A$6.1 billion ($5.7 billion) takeover offer for Zinifex Ltd ZFX.AX on Monday, the latest move in a hectic round of consolidation among Australian miners. 

 In recent weeks BHP Billiton ( BHP.AX ), the world's biggest miner, has made an all-stock $147 billion takeover offer for rival Rio Tinto ( RIO.AX ), while Brazil's Vale ( VALE5.SA ) has launched a $90 billion offer for Xstrata XTA.L. Here are some of major merger moves since June 2007. * March 3: Australian miner Oxiana launches takeover bid for Australian miner Zinifex, to create a A$11.5 billion company ($10.7 billion) which would be the world's No. 2 zinc producer. * Feb 7: BHP Billiton launches sweetened, but hostile, $147.4 billion (75.1 billion pound) bid for rival miner Rio Tinto, ending months of speculation. The deal would create the world's third-richest company, ranking behind only Exxon Mobil  ( XOM.N ). * Jan 21: Brazilian mining giant Vale, the world's largest iron ore producer, says it is in talks to buy Swiss-based diversified miner Xstrata. The acquisition could be worth an estimated $90 billion. It would create the world's biggest nickel producer, ahead of Russia's Norilsk Nickel. * Jan 17, 2008: Anglo American Plc ( AAL.L ) says it is in talks to buy control of two Brazilian iron ore projects owned by MMX Mineracao ( MMXM3.SA )( XMM.TO ) for around $5.5 billion. * Dec 21: Russia's United Company RUSAL will buy a stake in Norilsk Nickel ( GMKN.MM ) from Mikhail Prokhorov's Onexim Group, to build a globally competitive Russian metals and mining major. * Dec 17: Australia's Zinifex offers up to A$775 million in cash for nickel miner Allegiance Mining AGM.AX. * Dec 7: China's state-owned Sinosteel makes a $1 billion cash takeover proposal for Australian iron ore miner Midwest Corp MIS.AX, way above a rival all-share offer from Murchison Metals Ltd ( MMX.AX ), as Chinese companies push overseas to secure resource assets. * Dec 5: Xstrata makes a A$960 million cash bid for coal miner Resource Pacific, trumping an all-share offer by New Hope Corp, as it seeks to grow in Australia's booming resource sector. * Dec 4: Palmary Enterprises Ltd looks set to win a battle for Australian manganese miner Consolidated Minerals Ltd CSM.AX after raising its offer to $1 billion and securing rival bidder Pallinghurst's stake. * Oct 29: Xstrata says it has offered A$3.1 billion for Australia's Jubilee Mines NL JBM.AX. Potential counter-suitors are thought to include BHP, Vale and Norilsk Nickel. Norilsk outbid Xstrata earlier for Australian nickel miner LionOre. * July 12: Rio Tinto agrees to pay $38.1 billion for Canadian aluminum company Alcan. By Oct 25, 79.4 percent of Alcan's shares had been tendered to Rio, which extended its bid to November 8 to buy the remaining Alcan shares. The acquisition makes Rio the world's largest aluminum producer. * June 25 2007: Germany's Norddeutsche Affinerie ( NAFG.DE ) offers 777 million euros to buy Belgian rival Cumerio CUMR.BR. The combination would create the world's third-biggest copper refiner and Europe's largest producer. Sources: Reuters (Compiled by Asia Commodities desk; additional writing by Gillian Murdoch)
