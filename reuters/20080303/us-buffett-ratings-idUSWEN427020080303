 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Warren Buffett said rating agencies should be affected for a long time by recent events, but it will be difficult for his Berkshire Hathaway Inc ( BRKa.N ) holding company to lighten up on its interest in Moody's Corp ( MCO.N ) because of the large size of its stake. 

 Buffett, speaking on CNBC, also said that he might buy a stake in another domestic drug company. Berkshire Hathaway owns shares of Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ.N ). (Reporting by  Dan Wilchins , editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
