 LONDON  (Reuters) - Miner Xstrata XTA.L said on Monday record output in 2007 had fuelled a 13 percent rise in net profit, and that it was still scouting for acquisitions during takeover talks with suitor Vale ( VALE5.SA ) of Brazil. 

 The world's fifth-biggest mining group by market capitalization said net profit rose to $5.54 billion last year from $4.89 billion in 2006, just short of $5.63 billion forecast in a Reuters Estimates poll of nine analysts. Xstrata, which is headquartered in Switzerland and listed in London, produced record amounts of coking and thermal coal, ferrochrome, nickel, zinc and platinum in 2007. The firm expects "significant" volume growth in 2008 and has already seen robust cash flows this year amid strong commodity prices, Chief Executive Mick Davis told Reuters. Xstrata said 2007 revenue rose 12 percent to $28.54 billion, while earnings per share before discontinued operations and exceptional items also rose 12 percent, to $5.60. Xstrata shares fell 1.0 percent to 39.21 pounds by 1450 GMT (9:50 a.m. EST), in line with 1.2 percent fall in the UK mining index .FTNMX1770. The shares have gained around a quarter since Vale said on January 21 that it was in talks to buy the firm. SEARCH GOES ON Davis declined to give details about the talks with Vale, but said the negotiations did not stop Xstrata looking for opportunities both large and small. "What we are trying to do as a management team is to position Xstrata to capture value for shareholders," he said in an interview. "A Vale transaction would be interesting in that pursuit, as would other transactions, whether ... Xstrata does the buying or Xstrata does the selling." He said a merger with Anglo American Plc ( AAL.L ) would be positive for both parties, but did not hold out hope the two would end up together if the Vale deal fell through. "There's no doubt that a combination of Anglo and Xstrata would give rise to a lot of synergies ... but things have to be in the universe of the possible," Davis said. Vale ( RIO.N ) said on Friday it had reached its limits in takeover talks, and that any deal would depend on the resolution of a dispute over marketing rights held by Swiss commodities trader Glencore, which holds a 35 percent stake in Xstrata. Since the financial results were largely in line with forecasts, many analysts focused on the takeover situation. "I am optimistic. I think that there will be a deal done because both parties will in the end be sensible ... It's such a good deal for both of them," said Tom Gidley-Kitchin at Charles Stanley in London. "It will become clear to them when Vale reaches the point where it is not prepared to go any further ... At that point they will look to see how they can meet each other." A link-up would help diversify Vale away from iron ore, which generates 40 percent of its cash flow, and boost its presence in copper and nickel. Worth an estimated $90 billion, the deal would be one of the largest takeovers in history and would create the world's biggest nickel firm, overtaking Russia's Norilsk ( GMKN.MM ). Xstrata, the No. 1 zinc producer, said it was optimistic about the outlook for metals prices as a widely-feared economic downturn in the United States would have scant effect on China. The bulk of China's commodity requirements, including $9.3 trillion to be spent on infrastructure over the next decade, are driven by internal forces rather than exports to industrialized nations, Davis told a results presentation. "To put this into context, China is building the equivalent of a new Australia every year in terms of infrastructure required," he said. Xstrata, which generates three-quarters of its operating profit from nickel and copper, said it had a pipeline of organic growth projects of $30 billion, which was expected to deliver compound annual volume growth of over 12 percent through 2013.
