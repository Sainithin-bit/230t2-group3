 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Warren Buffett said demand for oil is growing regularly, supply is finite and most U.S. oil field are depleting and if these trends continue, "who knows what the equilibrium price will be." 

 Alternative energy helps, but is not a "big answer to the kind of demand that is coming along," Buffett said, speaking on  CNBC. (Reporting by  Dan Wilchins , editing by Dave Zimmerman)
