 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry 
Paulson reaffirmed his commitment to a strong dollar on Monday 
and said the currency will reflect the United States' long-term 
economic strength. 

  "A strong dollar is in our nation's interest," he told 
Bloomberg Television. "The long-term (U.S. economic) 
fundamentals are very solid and they're going to be reflected 
in our currency."  The dollar was little changed against a basket of 
currencies in late-morning trading, after hitting a new 
all-time low earlier in the day.  (Editing by Theodore d'Afflisio)
