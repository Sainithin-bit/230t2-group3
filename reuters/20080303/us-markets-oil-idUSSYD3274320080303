 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oil hit another record high on Monday on expectations that OPEC will rebuff calls for more oil this week and after the dollar briefly touched new lows against other major currencies. 

 Gains were clipped, however, by a late rebound in the dollar and expectations that weekly government inventory data due on Wednesday will show an eighth weekly increase in U.S. crude oil stocks. U.S. crude oil for April delivery settled up 61 cents at $102.45 a barrel, after an earlier record high of $103.95. London Brent crude settled up 38 cents at $100.48 a barrel. The dollar briefly tumbled to lifetime lows against the euro and a basket of major currencies early on Monday, prompting a wave of buying in oil and other commodities. Oil held onto some of its gains after better-than-expected U.S. manufacturing data spurred a recovery in the dollar. "There is no top in sight yet for crude futures because hedge funds are looking at how far the U.S. dollar will fall," said Phil Flynn of Alaron Trading in Chicago. "They are buying commodities to hedge against inflation because hanging on to the dollar means they lose value." Speculators on the New York Mercantile Exchange increased net long positions in crude oil futures last week to the highest in seven weeks, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission released on Friday. NO OPEC HIKE Further support for oil came from signs the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has no plans to raise oil production at its meeting in Vienna this week even as oil prices have reached record inflation-adjusted highs. "I don't think OPEC would consider increasing production because then we would be increasing to meet demand that doesn't exist," said OPEC President Chakib Khelil. One OPEC source said the producer group may discuss a small increase of 500,000 barrels a day, citing high oil prices, while reiterating that the current fundamental supply and demand picture did not support an increase in output. Lower supplies from Iran and Nigeria pushed overall OPEC oil output down in February from January, according to a Reuters survey.  Tensions in the Middle East, South America and Nigeria remain supportive of oil because of their potential to disrupt supply. OPEC members Venezuela and Ecuador sent troops to their borders with Colombia after Colombia bombed rebels inside Ecuador. In Nigeria, attackers blew up a police houseboat on Bonny Island, an oil and gas export hub in southern Niger Delta.
