 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co ( 7201.T ) said on Monday its Nissan-brand vehicle sales were down 3 percent in February in the U.S. market, while sales of its luxury Infiniti-brand were down less than 1 percent. 

 Nissan's sales tallies were adjusted for an additional selling day last month compared with a year earlier. Both divisions of the Japanese automaker reported higher sales on an unadjusted basis for February. Nissan's flagship Nissan-brand sold 76,151 vehicles in the United States in February, compared with 75,514 a year earlier. Infiniti-brand sales were 10,068 in February, compared with 9,704 units a year earlier, the company said. (Reporting by  Kevin Krolicki ; Editing by  Andre Grenon )
