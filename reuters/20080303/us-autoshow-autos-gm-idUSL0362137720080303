 GENEVA  (Reuters) - February was a very disappointing month in terms of car sales for the U.S. industry, but General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) still expects a second half recovery, GM Vice Chairman Bob Lutz said on Monday. 

 "February was a very disappointing month for industry sales," Lutz, who oversees product development, told Reuters on the sidelines of the unveiling of a concept car for the Saab brand ahead of the annual Geneva autoshow. Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) also continues to forecast a rebound in U.S. industry sales in the second half of the year, an executive later told Reuters at a separate event on Monday. Their forecasts stand in contrast to those of Chrysler LLC President Jim Press, who said last week that such expectations were "wishful thinking." On Monday, Ford reported a 10 percent drop for February and said it would cut second quarter production. GM's numbers were worse. It reported a 16 percent decline in U.S. sales on an adjusted basis for the month, with the drop in sales of large trucks and SUVs. It also cut its second-quarter production plan. The auto sales data represent one of the first snapshots of overall U.S. consumer demand. Their weakness could provide more evidence for those who believe the U.S. economy has already slipped into recession. Lutz remained optimistic about the second half of the year, however. "We still expect the economy to recover in the second half," he told Reuters. "(But) our crystal ball is not that much better than anybody else's." At another event, Ford Vice President Jim Farley told Reuters the company expects U.S. industry sales to drop to about 15.5 million cars and light trucks for the year. "The industry is about where we thought it was going to be," Farley said after unveiling Ford's new Fiesta small car. "We see the second half being stronger. It is a very challenging market pricing wise, but we have the right mix now." Farley said Ford is hopeful about its prospects in the second half in part because of the launch of new vehicles in North America, such as the redesigned Focus, the F-150 series pickup trucks and others. Ford Europe Chief Executive John Fleming told Reuters the company expects 2008 industry sales of about 17.4 million to 17.6 million in its main markets in Europe, but sees the results being about flat when the fast-growing Russian market is included.
