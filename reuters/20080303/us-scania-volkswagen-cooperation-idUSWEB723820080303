 HAMBURG, Germany  (Reuters) - Volkswagen ( VOWG.DE ) intends to bring German truck maker MAN ( MANG.DE ) into a cooperation accord with Swedish rival Scania ( SCVb.ST ) after VW increased its Scania stake to a majority, a spokeswoman for VW said on Monday. 

 One industry source said VW, which is also MAN's biggest shareholder, had created the option for taking "further measures" by raising its Scania stake to 68.6 percent. VW has been trying to broker a  three-way truck merger that would include its heavy truck business in South America. The source said MAN had not been involved in the Scania sale talks.
