 STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - Scania ( SCVb.ST ) Chief Executive Leif Ostling said on Monday he plans to stay in his post at least until his contract expires next year and then he will see after that. 

 Asked about his future at a news conference following Volkswagen's ( VOWG.DE ) move to take a controlling stake in Scania, CEO Ostling said: I have a contract until next year, and I will stay for that long. After that we will talk about it." Earlier on Monday, VW bought a stake from Investor AB ( INVEb.ST ) to boost its stake in Scania to 68.6 percent of voting rights in the truck maker. On Feb 25, SKF ( SKFb.ST ) said Ostling had been nominated to become chairman of its board, sparking speculation that there was movement on a possible combination of Scania and MAN.
