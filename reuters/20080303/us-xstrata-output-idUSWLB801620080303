 LONDON  (Reuters) - Miner Xstrata XTA.L expects buoyant production growth in 2008 and has had robust cash flows so far this year from strong commodities prices, the CEO said on Monday. 

 "We're looking at significant volume growth this year," Chief Executive Mick Davis told Reuters. "And prices, at the levels where they are, we are enjoying pretty robust cash flow (so far this year)." Davis declined to comment on current takeover talks with suitor Vale ( VALE5.SA ) ( RIO.N ) of Brazil, but said the firm was constantly looking at opportunities. "There's no doubt that a combination of Anglo ( AAL.L ) and Xstrata would give rise to a lot of synergies ... but things have to be in the universe of the possible."
