 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Monday said that financial institutions should seize the opportunity to raise fresh capital if they think they need it, for both their own and the sake of the wider economy. 

 "The big message that I am giving to financial institutions is that if you think there is any likelihood that you are going to need capital, and it is available today, go get it," Paulson said during a question and answer session after a speech to an economic policy conference. "Because then it is better for you and the overall economy, much better than shrinking your balance sheet," he said. (Reporting by  Alister Bull ; Editing by Theodore d'Afflisio)
