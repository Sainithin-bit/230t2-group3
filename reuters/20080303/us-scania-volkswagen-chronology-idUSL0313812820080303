 (Reuters) - Volkswagen has built its voting stake in Sweden's Scania to a majority, paving the way for it to forge a three-way deal with German peer MAN to create Europe's truck market leader. 

 Here is a chronology of key events: August 6, 1999 - Volvo launches offer to buy Swedish peer Scania in deal worth 60.7 billion Swedish crowns ($9.8 billion) March 14, 2000 - European Union rejects plans by Swedish truck maker Volvo to buy Scania on competition grounds March 27, 2000 - VW acquires 34 percent of the votes and 18.7 percent of the capital of Scania from Investor AB for 370 Swedish crowns per A share, or around $1.6 billion May 25, 2000 - Volkswagen Chief Executive Ferdinand Piech becomes chairman of Scania September 13, 2006 - MAN discloses interest in Scania and says it wants to acquire more than a 90 percent stake for 9.6 billion euros ($14.56 billion) September 26, 2006 - Volkswagen, the biggest shareholder in MAN and Scania, rebuffs MAN's plan. It suggests instead a three-way alliance that would include VW's heavy truck business based in South America. Scania's second-biggest shareholder, Investor AB, also rejects a MAN takeover of Scania October 4, 2006 - Volkswagen acquires 15 percent stake in MAN, making it the largest shareholder in the German truck maker October 12, 2006 - MAN raises its offer to more than 10 billion euros and becomes Scania's third-biggest investor by buying more stock December 6, 2006 - Scania Chief Executive Leif Ostling likens MAN approach to a German "blitzkrieg", a remark for which he later apologizes January 11, 2007 - Volkswagen's supervisory board formally rejects MAN's offer for Scania and seeks a friendly deal January 23, 2007 - MAN withdraws its offer and agrees to seek a friendly alliance once tempers cool February 27, 2007 - VW raises its MAN stake to 29.9 percent. Days later it increases its Scania stake so that it holds 20 percent of its capital and 36.4 percent of the votes August/September 2007 - Efforts to forge a three-way accord make scant progress. Ostling calls for the new group to be based in Sweden February 5, 2008 - MAN says it swapped more liquid B shares with investors looking to get out of their A shares, which hold more votes, bringing Scania voting stake up slightly to 17 percent March 3, 2008 - VW builds its voting stake in Scania to 68.8 percent by paying around 2.9 billion euros for shares held by Wallenberg family foundations and the family-controlled Investor AB investment vehicle.
