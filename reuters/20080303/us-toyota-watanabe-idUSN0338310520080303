 GENEVA  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ) still expects to see a recovery in second-half industry-wide auto sales in the North American market although tighter credit conditions have injected a note of uncertainty, the automaker's president said on Monday. 

 Speaking through a translator on the eve of the Geneva auto show, Toyota President Katsuaki Watanabe also said that the stronger yen was making conditions tougher for the automaker but vowed to take steps to respond. "Sharp and sudden foreign exchange movements need to be avoided," Watanabe said. "The appreciation of the yen makes it tougher to make a profit, and Toyota will take various measures to address that situation."
