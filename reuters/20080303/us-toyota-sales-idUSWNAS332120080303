 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ) said on Monday its adjusted U.S. sales in February fell 6.6 percent from last year as light truck sales were pressured by high gas prices. 

 The Japanese automaker said U.S. sales in February fell to 182,169 vehicles from 187,330 in the same month last year. (Reporting by  Ben Klayman ; Editing by  Derek Caney )
