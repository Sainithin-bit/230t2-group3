 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Australian miner Oxiana Ltd OXR.AX launched an agreed A$6 billion ($5.6 billion) takeover offer for Zinifex Ltd ZFX.AX on Monday, as they look to diversify to benefit from booming global minerals demand. 

 A tie-up of the two miners would create an A$11.5 billion market value diversified miner with operations in Australia and Asia, which would rank as the world's No.2 zinc miner and with sizeable production of copper, lead, gold and silver. Zinifex shares rose as much as 11.3 percent to A$12.39, but traded below the implied valuation offered by Oxiana, suggesting that traders were not expecting a rival bidder or a higher offer. Chances of a rival bid were slim as it was an agreed bid, they said. "I would have thought that Oxiana would be more the one people looked at as a target. So in some ways, it's a bit of a protection for Oxiana from being taken over itself," said Steve Robinson, a fund manager with Alleron Investment Management. "Zinifex has got good cash flows which Oxiana can potentially use to fund its own or its organic growth," he added. Oxiana shares fell as much as 3.8 percent. "Oxiana had pretty good growth profile going forward, but this kind of dilutes that because Zinifex doesn't have a lot of organic growth if you look at their production profile," Robinson added. Oxiana's offer valued Zinifex at A$12.68 per share, a 14 percent premium to Zinifex's Friday's close. That is still a far cry from Zinifex's life-high of A$21.60 reached in July 2007. DIVERSIFACATION The two companies told a joint media conference that integration was their top priority though they would continue to look for more acquisitions outside Australia. "The companies have agreed that they won't be out there soliciting bids, that's not the intention," said Owen Hegarty, managing director of Oxiana. Each company agreed to pay the other an A$55 million break fee if they sought alternative transactions. "The most important thing for these two companies ... is to get on with this integration and the rest of the market will have to make up their hunch," he added when asked if he expected a new bidder to emerge. The combined group would become Australia's third-biggest diversified company by market value behind BHP Billiton Ltd ( BHP.AX ) and Rio Tinto Ltd ( RIO.AX ), the companies said in a presentation. "The combination makes strong strategic sense," said Zinifex Chief Executive Andrew Michelmore, who will head up the combined company. The combined group would earn about 63 percent of its revenue from zinc, 23 percent from copper and the rest from gold, lead and silver based on their December 2007 proforma output data. The proposed deal has been rumored since July last year, when Oxiana chief executive Hegarty said in an interview that Zinifex had quality assets and a takeover would create cost savings. Morgan Stanley was advising Oxiana while UBS was the financial adviser to Zinifex. GLOBAL CONSOLIDATION It comes at a time when big global miners have been making bold takeover bids. BHP, the world's biggest miner, has made an all-stock $147 billion takeover offer for rival Rio, while Brazil's Vale ( VALE5.SA ) has launched a $90 billion offer for Xstrata XTA.L. Consolidation in global miners is driven by expectations of continued strong demand for base metals from China and India as the two Asian economies grow rapidly. Analysts are expecting iron ore and coal prices to rise between 60 percent to 100 percent when annual contract negotiations conclude in April. "The two companies have largely complementary asset portfolios and development pipelines and the merged entity will be very well positioned to benefit from the strength of demand for commodities we see stretching out for many years," Michelmore said in an earlier statement. Oxiana would offer 3.2 of its shares for each Zinifex share, and the new entity would be equally held by shareholders of each company, the two firms said in the statement. The new company, which would be renamed once the merger was completed around June or July, would have combined earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of A$1.7 billion. It would have a cash balance of A$1.9 billion, providing a strong platform for both organic growth and acquisitions. Oxiana Chairman Barry Cusack will chair the new company, while Hegarty will become a director. Zinifex reshaped itself as a pure miner last year with the spin-off of its smelting assets into Nyrstar ( NYR.BR ), a venture with Belgium's Umicore NV/SA ACUMt.BR. The tie-up will provide diversification for both companies, although the combined entity will still remain highly exposed to zinc, which has fallen sharply in the past year because of a looming supply surplus as new mines are activated. Zinifex said its recommended A$852 million takeover offer for Australian nickel group Allegiance Mining Ltd AGM.AX will not be affected by the Oxiana proposal. Shares in Zinifex stood 9.9 percent higher at A$12.23 at 0153 GMT, while Oxiana was down 2 percent at A$3.90, while the broader market .AXJO was down 3.2 percent.
