 (Reuters) - Australian miner Oxiana Ltd OXR.AX launched an agreed A$6.1 billion ($5.7 billion) takeover offer for Zinifex Ltd ZFX.AX on Monday, looking to diversify to benefit from booming global minerals demand. 

 Here are some key facts about the two Melbourne-based miners: BACKGROUND: * OXIANA: First listed on the Australian Stock Exchange in 1932. It moved from gold mining to gold exploration in the 1980s. Both Chairman Barry Cusack and CEO Owen L. Hegarty formerly worked with mining giant Rio Tinto in Australia. * ZINIFEX: Operates Australia's largest zinc mine. It was assembled from the remnants of the Pasminco group that collapsed in 2001, owing billions of dollars due to depressed metal prices and bad hedge bets. PROFITS: * OXIANA: 2007 profit was A$305.8 million ($280.6 million) versus A$553.2 million in 2006. Market capitalization of about A$6.1 billion, according to Oct 2007 company statistics. * ZINIFEX: After-tax profits in 2007 were A$1.3 billion; a 24 percent rise on 2006. The company's mining business contributed A$8.3 billion to 2007 profits. MINES AND PRODUCTION: * OXIANA: Sepon gold and copper mines in south-central Laos, acquired from Rio Tinto in 2004, hold an estimated 3.8 million ounces of gold and 1.7 million tons of copper. The open-pit mines produced 102,390 ounces of gold, and 62,541 tons of copper in 2007. -- Golden Grove, 450 km (280 miles) northeast of Perth, western Australia, produced 131,954 tons of zinc, 15,404 tons of copper, 48,807 ounces of gold, 3,165,408 ounces of silver and 8,119 tons of lead in 2007. * ZINIFEX: Century Mine, at Lawn Hill in Queensland, is the world's second largest, and Australia's largest, zinc mine. It produced about 502,038 tons of zinc concentrates and 37,845 tons of lead concentrates in 2007. -- Rosebery Mine, discovered more than one hundred years ago on Tasmania's north-west coast, produced about 150,619 tons of zinc concentrate in 2007. THE MERGER: -- The tie-up announced on Monday would create a diversified miner with a market value of A$11.5 billion and operations in Australia and Asia. -- Oxiana's Cusack will chair the new company, while chief executive Hegarty will become a director. -- Zinifex said its recommended A$852 million takeover offer for Australian nickel group Allegiance Mining Ltd AGM.AX will not be affected by the Oxiana proposal.
