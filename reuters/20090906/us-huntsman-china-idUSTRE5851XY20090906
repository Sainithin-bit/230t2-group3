 LONDON  (Reuters) - Huntsman ( HUN.N ), an American chemicals group, is looking to buy chemical plants in China with part of a $2.7 billion compensation package, said senior executive Paul Hulme in a Financial Times interview on Monday. 

 "We are looking for potential acquisitions. The obvious place to look was China," said Hulme, Huntsman Textile Effects division global president. The firm is assessing a range of Chinese-owned assets alongside others belonging to European firms Clariant ( CLN.VX ) and BASF -- who have indicated they may be willing to sell -- the report said. Huntsman was "very liquid" according to Hulme after receiving a compensation payout over the collapse of a private equity backed buy-out by Hexion last year.
