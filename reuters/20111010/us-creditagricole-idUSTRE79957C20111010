 PARIS  (Reuters) - French banks do not need capital injections, the deputy chairman of the board of directors of Credit Agricole, Philippe Brassac, told Les Echos newspaper, adding that this would be a "false remedy" for the sovereign debt crisis. 
 Brassac added that the problems at Belgian-French bank Dexia had "nothing to do with the situation of the French banks, although it does add confusion." The comments were released ahead of the publication of a full interview with Brassac in the Tuesday edition of Les Echos. (Reporting by  James Regan , editing by Dave Zimmerman)
