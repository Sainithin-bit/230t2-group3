 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Belgium's financial markets watchdog FSMA said on Monday that trading in shares of Dexia would not resume at the market opening on Monday morning, but only later in the day after a news conference and analyst call. 
 Dexia shares were suspended on Thursday after falling 42 percent in the week. Dexia is holding a news conference at 0900 CET (0700 GMT). An FSMA spokesman said trading was likely to resume at around midday. (Reporting by  Philip Blenkinsop )
