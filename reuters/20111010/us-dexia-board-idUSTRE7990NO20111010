 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - The board of Franco-Belgian financial services group Dexia said on Monday it had accepted a rescue plan drawn up by the governments of France, Belgium and Luxembourg. 
 Specifically, it accepted Belgium's 4 billion euro offer to buy Dexia Bank Belgium, approved a scheme for state guarantees of up to 90 billion euros and instructed its chief executive to start talks with Caisse des Depots and La Banque Postale in order to strike a deal on French public financing.
