 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Diversified manufacturer Honeywell International Inc. ( HON.N ) reported an almost 14 percent rise in profit on Friday, but its shares declined after it forecast first-quarter earnings below expectations. 

 Fourth-quarter earnings at the world's largest maker of cockpit electronics for airplanes increased to $585 million, or 72 cents per diluted share, from $514 million, or 61 cents per diluted share, a year earlier. Stock analysts, on average, expected profit of 72 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue came in at $8.28 billion, up 13.8 percent from $7.28 billion, on growth at all four of the company's divisions -- aerospace, automation and control systems, specialty materials and transportation systems. The Morris Township, New Jersey-based company said separately it expects to report first-quarter profit of 60 cents to 62 cents per share on revenue of $7.7 billion. Analysts, on average, expect first-quarter profit of 63 cents per share on revenue of $7.67 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. "Revenues slightly beat our expectations across the board," wrote Merrill Lynch analyst John Inch in a note to clients. "We had hoped for a slightly better result from the commercial aerospace aftermarket ... considering the current robust industry environment." Overall aerospace sales at Honeywell were up 8.4 percent to $2.96 billion in the quarter. Honeywell shares fell 94 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $43.26 on the New York Stock Exchange, down about 4 percent for the year, while the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  is essentially flat. The shares had risen 10.6 percent in the fourth quarter. "There's a lot of expectation in this stock, and I think we're seeing that when it's not met, investors sort of shrug their shoulders and walk away for a while," said Peter Klein, a senior portfolio manager at Fifth Third Asset Management, which manages about $20 billion and owns Honeywell shares. He added that earnings were helped by a lower tax rate in the quarter. COMMERCIAL CONSTRUCTION HOLDS UP Honeywell's largest unit, automation and control, makes thermostats, alarms and other systems for running large buildings. While the unit has felt the effects of the slowing U.S. housing market, executives said the commercial construction sector has remained healthy. "We're less worried about it than we were a month ago," said David Cote, Honeywell's chairman and chief executive, on a conference call with analysts. Honeywell officials said they believe the U.S. economy is slowing, but not dramatically. "It may not be as robust in terms of growth as it was in '06, but it's still pretty darn good," said Cote. "If it stayed this bad all the time, I think we'd all be pretty darn happy." For the year, the company confirmed its earnings per share forecast of $2.85 to $2.95. Analysts, on average, expect $2.93 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. "We have a bias toward the high end of our 2007 EPS range," said Dave Anderson, chief financial officer, on the conference call.
