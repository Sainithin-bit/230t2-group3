 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Germany's Porsche AG ( PSHG_p.DE ) forecast on Friday it would be able to keep profits steady this fiscal year after income from its Volkswagen stake helped first-half pretax profit surge. 

 But its shares only edged higher as the market looked past the Volkswagen ( VOWG.DE ) windfall to focus on weaker car sales and revenue in the six months to the end of January. Earnings before taxes swelled to 1.45 billion euros ($1.9 billion) from 277.8 million a year before, while profit after tax rose sixfold to 1.05 billion euros, according to preliminary figures released before the sports car maker's annual meeting. Analysts polled by Reuters had on average expected first-half pretax profit of just 425 million euros. Porsche cited enhancement of its model mix and a one-off gain from its 27.4 percent stake in Volkswagen, in which it became the largest shareholder last year via a surprise swoop that Porsche said headed off a hostile takeover of VW. Hedging proceeds from the VW stake totaled hundreds of millions of euros, while revaluing the VW shares contributed 520 million euros more, it said. One analyst who asked not to be identified said he had heard from Porsche the hedges generated 600 million euros in income. "Assuming there are no surprises with VW or with the VW stock price, Porsche is confident to be able to achieve the previous year's result of 2.1 billion euros in the current year of business," the company said in a statement. Porsche shares, which have outperformed the DJ Stoxx European car sector index .SXAP by more than a quarter since the start of 2006, gained 0.5 percent to 1,105 euros at 0905 GMT, while the index eased 0.2 percent. "They were solid results but not enough to push the share higher," said Credit Suisse analyst Mike Dean. "The one-off impact from VW is well and good, but what is interesting is the way operating results developed without VW and Porsche did not give any information on that," added Merck Finck analyst Robert Heberger. Stripping out 520 million euros in VW revaluation gains, 600 million in hedging income and 7 million in associate income from VW would show underlying operating profit of 323 million euros, one analyst calculated. First-half revenues including divestment gains edged down 2.9 percent to 3.02 billion euros, while vehicle sales slipped 5.9 percent to 39,750 vehicles given a model changeover for the Cayenne offroader. It said it intended to keep full-year unit sales steady near the 96,794 vehicles it sold the previous year. At the Detroit car show early this month, Chief Executive Wendelin Wiedeking had struck a slightly more optimistic tone about pretax profits in the financial year ending July. He cited good business so far this year and solid orders for the refreshed Cayenne. At a news conference in December, Wiedeking had said Porsche would struggle to match the record 2.11 billion euros in pretax profit it made in 2005/06 year. (Additional reporting by Ralf Banser)
