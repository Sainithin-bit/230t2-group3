 SEATTLE  (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's quarterly profit beat 
Wall Street expectations on Thursday, driven by sales of server 
software and Xbox 360 game consoles, and the company raised its 
full-year profit target. 

  Shares of the world's largest software maker rose nearly 2 
percent in after-hours trade to $31.02, approaching a year high 
touched earlier this month.  Microsoft posted a 28 percent drop in fiscal second-quarter 
earnings as it deferred more than $1 billion in net income 
related to the consumer launch of its Windows Vista operating 
system and Office 2007 software due next week.  Those businesses account for most of its profit, and 
investors expect the new products to drive sales and earnings 
in the coming quarters.  "We think the company is in great shape," said Kim Caughey, 
an analyst at Fort Pitt Capital, which manages more than $1 
billion and holds Microsoft stock. "We're expecting the next 
couple of years for Microsoft to really hit its stride in terms 
of cash generation."  Net profit in its second quarter ended December 31 totaled 
$2.63 billion, or 26 cents per diluted share, compared with 
$3.65 billion, or 34 cents per diluted share, a year ago. 
Second-quarter sales rose 6 percent to $12.54 billion.  Analysts, on average, had expected Microsoft to report 
earnings per share of 23 cents on sales of $12.09 billion in 
the quarter, according to Reuters Estimates.  "A lot of the new products like Xbox 360 and SQL Server 
contributed to strong revenue growth this quarter," said 
Morningstar analyst Toan Tran.  The company said it deferred $1.64 billion in revenue and 
accompanying profit to this quarter from last quarter due to 
the way it accounts for upgrade coupons for those products.  Microsoft forecast third-quarter diluted earnings per share 
of 45 cents to 46 cents on revenue of $13.7 billion to $14 
billion. Analysts polled by Reuters Estimates, on average, 
expect earnings of 46 cents per share on sales of $14 billion.  For the full year, Microsoft lifted its earnings outlook 
range to $1.45 to $1.47 per share from an earlier range of 
$1.43 to $1.46 per share. The company narrowed its full-year 
revenue estimate range to between $50.2 billion and $50.7 
billion from between $50.0 billion and $50.9 billion.  On average, analysts expect full-year earnings of $1.45 per 
share on sales of $50.48 billion, based on Reuters Estimates.
  XBOX 360 SLOWDOWN?  In the past quarter, the company delivered strong Xbox 360 
sales, but Chief Financial Officer Chris Liddell scaled back 
its fiscal second-half sales forecast as the company looks to 
make the business profitable in the next fiscal year.  Microsoft shipped 10.4 million Xbox 360s from its November 
2005 launch to the end of 2006, beating a target of 10 million 
by the end of last year, and the large installed base helped to 
drive sales of Microsoft Studio's own "Gears of War" game.  The Redmond, Washington-based company now expects to have 
shipped a total of 12 million Xbox 360s by the end of June, 
below an earlier target of 13 million to 15 million consoles.  "We are just being cautious about the second half," said 
Liddell in an interview. "There is a reasonable amount of 
inventory in the channel."  Second-quarter sales at the entertainment and devices 
division rose 76 percent to $2.96 billion, but it lost nearly 
$300 million.  Microsoft's server business continued to grow at a rapid 
clip. Earnings at the server and tools division, which accounts 
for more than 20 percent of Microsoft sales, got a boost from a 
30 percent increase in SQL Server database software sales.  Second-quarter server sales rose 17 percent to $2.85 
billion and the division's profits rose 35 percent.  The company's online business struggled again. The business 
lost money for the fourth straight quarter and Microsoft scaled 
back its revenue outlook for the unit in the second half.  Microsoft said it will continue to invest for the long term 
in its online unit, which has been losing market share to 
Google Inc. in the Internet search business.  Shares of Microsoft have risen 12 percent since the start 
of its second quarter. Prior to the earnings announcement, the 
stock closed down 64 cents at $30.45 in Thursday Nasdaq trade.  "The stock from a technician's standpoint looks very good 
as it moves up very steadily on good volume," said Jim 
Hardesty, chief investment officer at Hardesty Capital 
Management, which owns Microsoft shares.  (Additional reporting by  Chris Sanders  in New York, Lisa
