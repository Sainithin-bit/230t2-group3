 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. military has awarded Michelin a 10-year $1.7 billion contract to provide tires for all its wheeled vehicles used around the world, the French tire-maker said on Thursday. 

 The contract from the Defense Supply Center in Columbus, Ohio is in addition to a recently awarded contract worth more than $700 million for U.S. military aircraft tires, Michelin said. Michelin is already the majority supplier of U.S. Army tactical tires, the company said. It has invested $16 million to increase military tire production to meet the surge in demand from the war in Iraq, the company said. The company said it would provide the tires from its own plants and competitive tire sourcing. Based in Greenville, South Carolina, Michelin's U.S. unit operates 19 plants and employs 22,300 people.
