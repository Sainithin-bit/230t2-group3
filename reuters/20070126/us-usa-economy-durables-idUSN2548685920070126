 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - New orders for U.S.-made durable goods rose a larger-than-expected 3.1 percent in December as demand for Boeing jetliners soared and most other sectors showed surprising strength, a government report showed on Friday. 

 Excluding volatile transportation orders, which are heavily skewed by aircraft, durable goods orders rose 2.3 percent in December following two monthly declines, a Commerce Department showed. Analysts polled by Reuters were expecting durables orders - goods meant to last 3 years or more -- to rise 2.5 percent overall. They were expecting a modest 0.5 percent gain when transportation orders were stripped out. "The economy this year is extremely dependent on both exports and capital spending and this figure suggests that capital spending will grow at a significant rate this year so it's a definite positive," said Michael Metz, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Co. in New York. "The Fed has to be reassured by all of this and the housing figures support the view of a soft landing in that sector. All this suggests there is no need for the Fed to do anything," Metz added. U.S. Treasury debt prices extended losses after the stronger-than-expected data, while the dollar initially strengthened against the yen and the euro. For the full 2006 year, new durable goods orders rose 7.0 percent from 2005, marking the third straight annual gain. Shipments for the full year increased 5.6 percent, also the third straight annual gain. Boeing Co. ( BA.N ) finished the year with strong orders, pushing its 2006 order book to 1,044 planes, a record level that beat rival Airbus ( EAD.PA ) for the first time since 2000. In December, transportation equipment orders rose 4.8 percent on the back of a 26.5 percent rise in civilian aircraft orders and a 20.5 percent rise in defense aircraft and parts. Boeing Co. Excluding defense, orders during the month rose 3.9 percent, far outstripping analysts' expectations of a 0.3 percent rise. Nondefense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a proxy for business spending, jumped 2.4 percent in December following declines in the previous two months. Analysts had expected a 0.6 percent rise in this category. Motor vehicles and parts orders also posted a strong gain of 6.8 percent, the highest monthly gain since August 2004, when they rose 8.2 percent. Machinery orders rose 5.0 percent, while primary metals orders rose 4.5 percent. Electrical equipment appliances and components were one of the few categories to fall, declining 1.4 percent.
