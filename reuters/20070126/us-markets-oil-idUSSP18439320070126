 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oil rose nearly $1 to over $55 a barrel on Friday on expectations cold weather in top consumer the United States would trigger a long-awaited rise in heating oil demand. 

 U.S. crude CLc1 rose 97 cents to $55.20 a barrel by 1849 GMT, after a $1.14 slide on Thursday. London Brent crude LCOc1 jumped 87 cents at $54.99. "OPEC cuts are gradually draining the surplus and winter has finally returned," said Nauman Barakat, senior vice president at Macquarie Futures USA. He added that a risk premium was coming back to the market as political tensions between the United States and Iran grew. Temperatures in the U.S. Northeast, the world's biggest heating oil market, were expected to stay below normal for at least the next week, according to AccuWeather. Unseasonably mild weather and a shift in fund flows had pushed oil down by as much as 18 percent this month, but the market's failure to break significantly below $50 a barrel last week has led to a rebound in prices. "With weather forecasts constantly shifting back and forth, price action should be expected to remain volatile with a downward basis," said Mike Fitzpatrick, vice president for energy risk management at Fimat USA. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has said it would wait to assess the impact of existing cuts of 1.7 million barrels per day before calling for further reductions. Rising geopolitical tensions were helping to support prices. The Bush administration in recent weeks has toughened its stance against major oil producer Iran, which the West has accused of seeking to secretly build an atomic bomb.
