 DAVOS, Switzerland  (Reuters) - New York Stock Exchange NYX.N Chief Executive John Thain said on Friday that plans to link up with the Tokyo Stock Exchange would be released next week, but that a Euronext-style merger was not on the cards. 

 "Over time it makes sense to have linkages with the Tokyo Stock Exchange ... We are working at it," he told reporters on the fringes of the World Economic Forum in Davos. "I don't think it is very likely that anything with Tokyo is the same type of merger that we'll have with Euronext." Thain later told Reuters that details of the link-up with Tokyo would be made public next week. The NYSE CEO also said that full integration of the NYSE and pan-European exchange Euronext ENXT.PA would take a year, and the combined exchange was open to include other European bourses. "In terms of Western Europe, there will be opportunities to include other marketplaces," he said. Thain said the NYSE had been open to including Borsa Italiana, with which Euronext held talks, and said it was likely that there would be some European additions to NYSE/Euronext. Euronext's head, Jean-Francois Theodore, said on Thursday he expects the tender offer to complete its merger with NYSE to start around the middle of February. "We are still waiting for the last regulatory approvals -- the ones from the Dutch finance ministry, the SEC (the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) ... and hopefully, normally, the tender offer should be closed in early April," he told CNBC TV. MORE CONSOLIDATION Exchange consolidation has gathered pace with NYSE merging with Euronext, while U.S. exchange Nasdaq ( NDAQ.O ) has made a hostile bid for the London Stock Exchange ( LSE.L ) which reaches a key stage on Friday when it has its last opportunity to change its offer. Asked about Nasdaq's move and whether it was a good one, Thain said he did not think hostile takeovers were the right strategy for stock exchanges. "For Nasdaq, if they were able to acquire London (Stock Exchange), it would help them a lot because Nasdaq has no international business. It is not clear that it would help London at all," Thain said. Asked whether NYSE could be interested in bidding for the LSE should the hostile bid by Nasdaq fail, Thain said: "We are just in the process of completing our merger with Euronext ... We are going to focus on that for now." The NYSE has been building up its presence in Asia and Thain said this would continue, although alliances rather than full mergers were the more likely path for it to take. "To fill out the global strategy, the other two places where we have to be ... are India and China," he said. Earlier in January, NYSE acquired a 5 percent stake in India's National Stock Exchange, securing a foothold in the fast-growing Asian giant. PREFERS CURRENT MTS STRUCTURE Thain also said he did not envisage a change of ownership for the MTS bond trading platform, whose control is currently shared by Euronext and the Italian stock exchange Borsa Italiana. He explained that in the structure of MTS there was a put and a call arrangement that would kick in if there was a change in the ownership structure, but said the jury was still out on whether the Euronext/NYSE merger would constitute a shift of control under the contract. "And there is also a question from a purely business view whether that would be a good idea to do that, because the participation of MTS comes from a lot of the region," he said. "So I think it actually would probably be bad for MTS's business if it was owned for instance 100 pct by Borsa Italiana. I think that it would hurt MTS' business and I think a bunch of the participants may not participate." "I don't think it is clear at all what will happen to the ownership structure of MTS. I think from our own perspective we would rather keep it the way it is." Euronext owns 51 percent in MBA, a holding that owns just over 60 percent of MTS. Borsa Italiana owns 49 percent of MBA.
