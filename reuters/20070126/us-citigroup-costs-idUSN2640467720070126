 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc. ( C.N ), the largest U.S. bank, plans to cut more than $1 billion of costs this year to help boost profits, Bloomberg News said on Friday, citing a person with direct knowledge of the matter. 

 A bank spokesman declined to comment. Citigroup will probably eliminate some jobs, move some positions to less-expensive locations, and streamline its risk-management department, the article said, citing the person. Chief Executive Charles Prince has charged new Chief Operating Officer Robert Druskin with finding ways to cut costs. Prince has said Druskin is to complete his review by the end of March, and is focusing on "structural matters" such as consolidating offices and operations, and moving employees. A $1 billion cutback would represent just 2 percent of Citigroup's $52.02 billion of operating expenses last year. It might assuage some investors who have demanded that Prince, now in his fourth year as chief executive, boost revenue faster than costs and do more to bolster Citigroup's stock price. Last year, Citigroup's operating profit rose 7 percent, compared with 28 percent profit growth at Bank of America Corp. ( BAC.N ), its largest rival. Several large U.S. banks have been paring expenses. No. 4 Wachovia Corp. WB.N expects in 2007 to approach $1 billion of annualized savings from its multi-year cost-cutting program. Citigroup shares closed on Friday up 74 cents at $54.67 on the New York Stock Exchange.
