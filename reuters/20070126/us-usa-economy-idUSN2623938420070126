 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Surprisingly strong gains reported in sales of new homes and new orders for costly manufactured goods in December signaled more vigor in some soft economic sectors but dashed hopes for early interest-rate cuts. 

 The two Commerce Department reports on Friday cemented market expectations that the Federal Reserve's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee will keep rates on hold when it holds a two-day meeting Tuesday and Wednesday. The strength of the figures surprised financial markets, giving the dollar's value a boost while initially driving down stock prices on fears of heightened inflation risks. New-home sales rose 4.8 percent in December to an annual pace of 1.12 million units. The median sales price rose to $235,000 in December from $232,200 in November, as builders cut the number of homes on the market to avoid inventory buildups. Orders for U.S.-made durable goods -- items intended to last three years or more -- rose 3.1 percent in December. While much of the gain came from strong demand for Boeing jetliners, other components like machinery and primary metals also posted sharp hikes. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  ended down 15.54 points at 12,487.02. It had been down more steeply earlier but recovered some of those losses on talk of possible bank mergers. The high tech-laden Nasdaq composite index  .IXIC  eked out a 1.25-point gain to close at 2,435.49. Bond prices also were little changed at the end of trading after steeper losses earlier because of concern about resurgent inflation potential from the brisk home sales and factory data. Analysts said recent indicators imply more underlying resilience in the economy than previously realized. SLOWDOWN OVER? "The problem for the Fed is that the FOMC meets next week and they have these strong housing data and even better general economic numbers to contend with," said economist Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors Inc. in Holland Pennsylvania. "The slowdown they had been pointing to is no longer there," he added. Over the full year 2006, new-home sales dropped 17.3 percent from 2005, the steepest fall in 16 years and the first year-over-year decline after a five-year rally. But investors focused on the strong December numbers and whether they stemmed from unseasonably warm weather or were a sign the slumping housing sector had bottomed out and was on the rebound along with manufacturing. Some worried the next interest-rate move could be up. "If this economy gets too good because of housing, or not (because of) housing, I worry what the Federal Reserve is going to do," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at Johnson Illington Advisors in Albany, New York. RATES A QUESTION Short-term interest rate futures prices trading during the day implied that the Fed will keep rates steady for much if not all 2007. Earlier this month futures priced at least 50 basis points in cuts for the year. The durable goods report showed that transportation orders in December climbed 4.8 percent on the back of a 26.5 percent rise in civilian aircraft orders and a 20.5 percent surge in defense aircraft and parts. Even excluding volatile transportation orders, which are heavily skewed by aircraft, durable goods orders rose 2.3 percent in December following two monthly declines -- a much stronger performance than Wall Street analysts expected. "The economy this year is extremely dependent on both exports and capital spending and this figure suggests that capital spending will grow at a significant rate this year so it's a definite positive," said Michael Metz, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Co. in New York. In 2006, new durable goods orders rose 7 percent from 2005, marking the third straight annual gain. Shipments for the full year increased 5.6 percent, also the third straight gain.
