 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of aluminum products maker Novelis Inc. NVL.NNVL.TO soared on Friday after it said it was in talks with various parties about the potential sale of the company. 

 The announcement followed a report in the Indian newspaper Hindustan Times that said the Aditya Vikram Birla (AVB) group, an Indian conglomerate, was considering an acquisition of Novelis for $5 billion to $6 billion. In its news release, Novelis said there could be no assurance about the timing or completion of any agreement and it gave no further details. A Novelis spokesman declined to comment on the report of Indian interest. The Indian newspaper cited "highly placed sources" as saying the deal would be in the vicinity of $5 billion and $6 billion. The sources said the group has completed preliminary due diligence and is expected to submit its bid shortly, with management support of the widely-held company. The Hindustan Times report said the acquisition of Novelis will make the AVB group's Hindalco Industries Ltd the world's largest player in the downstream business of aluminum products. The shares of Atlanta-based Novelis, which was spun-off from Canadian aluminum giant Alcan Inc.AL.TO, gained $3.99, or 13 percent, before being halted for news pending. In resumed early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the shares were up $9.12, or over 30 percent, at $39.25, before falling back to  $37.35. Last month, Novelis said that, as a result of ceilings on some of its contracts, it had not been able to pass on $350 million of metals price increases to customers in the first nine months of 2006. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had requested the disclosure, the company said. It believed it would be unable to pass on an additional $130 million in the fourth quarter. Novelis said that, based on market aluminum prices, it will be unable to pass on $230 million to $255 million in 2007 and $380 to $430 million in total after 2007. The company said that, under the scenarios described above, the impact of the ceilings would not cause it to default on its credit facility or senior notes. Novelis fired its chief executive in August after warning that profits would shrink because of soaring metal costs. In December, the company said it was looking ultimately to get rid of the aluminum price ceilings in its contracts. On December 29, Novelis named Edward Blechschmidt acting chief executive, effective January 2. Blechschmidt, a board member, succeeded Chairman William Monahan, who had also been interim chief executive officer since August.
