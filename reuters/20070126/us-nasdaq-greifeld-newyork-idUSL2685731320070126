 LONDON  (Reuters) - Nasdaq ( NDAQ.O ) Chief Executive Bob Greifeld is on a flight to New York from Switzerland, making it almost certain the London Stock Exchange ( LSE.L ) will not get a raised bid from its U.S. suitor, a source familiar with the matter said on Friday. 

 Greifeld, who had attended the Davos summit in Switzerland, did not hold any talks with the London Stock Exchange, which is fighting Nasdaq's offer valuing it at 2.5 billion pounds ($4.93 billion). Any increased offer by Nasdaq for LSE would have to be discussed by the two companies, so without any meeting before Saturday, the U.S. exchange's current offer would be final.
