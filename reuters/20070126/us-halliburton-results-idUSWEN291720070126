 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - Halliburton Co. ( HAL.N ) reported higher fourth-quarter profit before special items on Friday, just above analysts' estimates, as high energy prices stoked global demand for its oilfield services. 

 The company also offered reassurance about the outlook for its North American business, which investors have been watching intently due to a slide in natural gas prices. Income from continuing operations fell to $667 million, or 65 cents per share, from $1.1 billion, or $1.03 per share, a year earlier, including a $540 million tax benefit. Excluding special items, earnings rose to 62 cents a share from 51 cents, beating the average forecast of analysts polled by Reuters Estimates by 1 cent. "I think it's an OK quarter," RBC Capital Markets analyst Kurt Hallead said. "It's not gangbusters." Halliburton shares edged down more than 1 percent in early New York Stock Exchange trading. Quarterly revenue rose 8 percent to $6 billion. "Although we experienced weather-related activity decreases and holiday impacts in the United States during the fourth quarter, we expect demand for our services to remain strong throughout 2007," Chief Executive Dave Lesar said in a statement. KBR Inc. ( KBR.N ), which is about 80 percent-owned by Halliburton, reported lower fourth-quarter profit and sales on reduced activity from construction and military sites in Iraq. The Pentagon's largest contractor in Iraq, KBR said income from continuing operations fell to $43 million, or 28 cents per share, from $48 million, or 35 cents per share, a year earlier. Five analysts polled by Reuters Estimates had forecast, on average, a profit of 18 cents a share. KBR said consolidated revenue fell 8 percent to $2.5 billion. The engineering and construction services company, which had its initial public offering in November, has faced several investigations into alleged overbilling in Iraq. KBR shares were up 48 cents, or 2.1 percent, at $23.73 in morning New York Stock Exchange trade. Halliburton was down 37 cents, or 1.2 percent, at $29.37.
