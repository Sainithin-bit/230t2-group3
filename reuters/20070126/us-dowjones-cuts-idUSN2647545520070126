 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Dow Jones & Co. Inc. DJ.N said it will cut an unspecified number of administrative positions in field offices as part of a plan to centralize delivery operations for The Wall Street Journal and Barron's. 

 The cuts will be offset in part by new positions in regional centers in Chicopee, Massachusetts and South Brunswick, New Jersey, Dow Jones said in a company memo. The consolidation reflects Dow Jones' recent move to use subcontractors to deliver the Journal and Barron's to homes and offices. "With subcontractors delivering those publications now, our aim is to manage those delivery partners best," the memo said. "As a result, we're consolidating the former regional structure and building a new centralized delivery operations group." The changes will take place over the next five months, the memo said. Employees who lose their jobs will receive full severance benefits, it added.
