 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Fortune Brands Inc. FO.N, which sells a large variety of home fixtures, said on Friday that first-quarter earnings would be down about 20 percent due to the slowing housing market and higher costs for commodities such as copper and zinc. 

 Fortune shares, which had gained 18 percent over the last seven months, were down 3.5 percent in morning trade. Bernstein Research analyst Robert van Brugge said the company's first-quarter outlook was below his expectations, which had called for profit to fall about 14 percent. "I think it's good that management is putting all the inevitable, bad news out on the table," said van Brugge, who has an "Outperform" rating on the shares. "This is reality ... a cyclical housing downturn. The good thing is that at least they have the stability of the spirits business, which has performed very well," van Brugge added. Fortune, which also sells golf equipment and spirits, reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter profit as strong sales of its Jim Beam and Courvoisier cognac overshadowed weakness in the company's home products unit. Fourth-quarter net income rose to $251.8 million, or $1.62 per share, from $175.9 million, or $1.17 per share, a year ago. Excluding a net gain from a deferred tax benefit and restructuring costs, Fortune said it earned $1.39 per share, topping analysts' average estimate of $1.35 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. "I would call it an in-line quarter," said van Brugge, adding that the earnings beat was mostly a result of other, non-operating income and certain minority interests. Fortune said total net sales were $2.28 billion, up 16 percent from $1.96 billion a year ago. Comparable sales for the home and hardware brands, which include Simonton windows and MasterBrand cabinets, fell at a mid-single-digit rate, but Fortune said cost controls helped limit the adverse impact on margins. Comparable spirits sales grew at a double-digit rate, Fortune said, with particular strength in the United States and Asia. Fortune became one of the world's top spirits companies in 2005 with its purchase of more than 20 spirits brands -- including Canadian Club whiskey, Knob Creek bourbon and Sauza tequila. The company said in October that a softening housing market would hurt sales through the first half of 2007 of its home brands. "We also expect second-half results in our home products business -- while potentially down -- will be better than the first half as market conditions begin to improve and our comparisons ease," said Fortune Chief Executive Norm Wesley in a statement. He added that Fortune was raising prices on certain items and managing costs to help offset the impact of higher commodities costs. Deerfield, Illinois-based Fortune expects full-year profit before items to be in the range of down mid-single digits to up low-single digits. This implies earnings per share of about $5.00 to $5.40, van Brugge said, which is below the $5.54 per share consensus held by Wall Street analysts, according to Reuters Estimates. Fortune shares were down $2.95 at $80.01 on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares have traded in a 52-week range of $86.90 to $68.45.
