 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Germany's Porsche ( PSHG_p.DE ) forecast on Friday that it would be able to maintain profits in this fiscal year after first-half pretax profit easily beat what analysts had expected. 

 Earnings before taxes rose sharply to 1.45 billion euros ($1.9 billion) from 277.8 million euros while profit after tax was 1.05 billion euros. Analysts polled by Reuters had on average expected first-half pretax profit of 425 million euros. The company said: "Assuming there are no surprises with VW or with the VW stock price, Porsche is confident to be able to achieve the previous year's result of 2.1 billion euros in the current year of business."
