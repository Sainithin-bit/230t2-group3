 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Fortune Brands Inc. FO.N reported better-than-expected quarterly profit on Friday as strong sales of such spirits as Jim Beam bourbon and Courvoisier cognac overshadowed weakness in the company's home products unit. 

 Net income for the fourth quarter was $251.8 million, or $1.62 per share, compared with $175.9 million, or $1.17 per share, a year ago. Excluding special items, Fortune earned $1.39 per share. Analysts on average were expecting $1.35 per share, excluding items, according to Reuters Estimates. Fortune, which also sells golf equipment and kitchen cabinets, said total net sales were $2.28 billion, up 16 percent from $1.96 billion a year ago. Comparable sales for the company's home and hardware brands fell at a mid-single-digit rate in the quarter. Fortune became one of the world's top spirits companies in 2005 with its purchase of more than 20 spirits brands. The company said in October that a softening housing market would hurt sales through the first half of 2007 of its home brands, which include Simonton windows and MasterBrand cabinets. Fortune, based in Deerfield, Illinois, expects first-quarter earnings before special items to be down about 20 percent, due to the challenging home products market and higher commodities costs. For the full year, Fortune expects earnings before items to be in the range of down mid-single digits to up low-single digits. Analysts on average were expecting $1.07 per share for the first quarter and $5.54 per share for fiscal 2007.
