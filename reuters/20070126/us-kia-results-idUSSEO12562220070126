 SEOUL  (Reuters) - Kia Motors Corp. ( 000270.KS ), South Korea's No.2 auto maker, said on Friday it turned to a quarterly loss, hit by a stronger won and higher marketing costs. 

 Earnings for Kia, the affiliate of top South Korean auto maker Hyundai Motor Co. ( 005380.KS ) are expected to improve this year, helped by lower raw material costs and as production ramps up from its recently-opened Slovakia plant, lessening currency-related risk. Still, many analysts predict Kia will face challenges in 2007 due to heavier spending on marketing and as a firmer won currency  KRW=  will keep putting pressure on the company, which sells about 80 percent of its vehicles abroad. Sales at home, where Kia has a 23 percent market share, are not expected to pick up any time soon amid sluggish consumer sentiment in Asia's third largest economy and a lack of new models. Kia reported a net loss of 200 million won ($213,800) in the fourth quarter ended on December 31, compared to a revised 263.7 billion won profit a year earlier when a corporate tax refund boosted earnings by around 80 billion won. The result widely missed a consensus forecast for 57.5 billion won in a Reuters poll of seven analysts. Kia reported a net loss of 43.9 billion won in the third quarter of 2006. In the October-December period, Kia posted an operating loss of 55 billion won, compared to an operating profit of 54.1 billion won a year earlier and a revised 88.6 billion loss in the third quarter. Analysts expected Kia to report an 18.6 billion won operating loss. On Thursday, Hyundai posted a surprise 8.6 percent drop in quarterly operating profit, hit by a firmer won and weaker sales in a fiercely competitive global market. The company set a 2007 sales target of 18.3 trillion won, up 5 percent from last year, and said it would lay out 1.78 trillion won in capital expenditure, little changed on the previous year. The won's value  KRW=  on average rose 8.4 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier and gained 1.8 percent from the third quarter, dampening Kia's earnings, as the company sells about 80 percent of its products abroad. Sales rose 11 percent to 5.09 trillion won in the fourth quarter from 4.58 trillion won a year ago. That compared to an estimate of 5.16 trillion won, according to a Reuters' poll. For 2007, Kia is expected to post a net profit of 408 billion won, according to 21 analysts polled by Reuters Estimates. Shares in Kia, which has a market value of $4.32 billion, fell 1.29 percent to 11,500 won by 0111 GMT, compared to a 1 percent decline in the broader market  .KS11 . Kia fell 12.4 percent in the fourth quarter, underperforming a 4.6 percent fall in the KOSPI index. ($1=935.6 Won)
