 LONDON  (Reuters) - Shares in software group Business Objects BOBJ.PABOBJ.O rallied 4.9 percent on Friday as traders cited renewed speculation that its larger rival Oracle Corp. ORCL.O could make a takeover bid. 

 Oracle has previously mentioned Business Objects as a possible takeover target in the past but the company said it had no plans to be bought. Business Objects Director of Communications Philippe Laguerre said: "We never comment on rumors as a matter of policy." Laguerre said the company was also in a quiet period ahead of publication of its fourth quarter/full year earnings on February 6.
