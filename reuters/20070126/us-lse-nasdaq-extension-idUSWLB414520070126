 LONDON  (Reuters) - U.S. Nasdaq Stock Market Inc ( NDAQ.O ) said on Friday it had extended its hostile offer for London Stock Exchange Plc ( LSE.L ) until Saturday, February 10. 

 Nasdaq, which owns almost 30 percent of the LSE and is offering 1,243 pence per share or 2.7 billion pounds ($5.3 billion) in total, had set its own deadline of January 27 for LSE investors to accept the offer. But under UK takeover rules, its bid had until February 10 either to lapse or go unconditional.
