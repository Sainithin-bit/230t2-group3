 LONDON  (Reuters) - The Nasdaq Stock Market Inc. renounced the option of raising its hostile offer for the London Stock Exchange on Friday, leaving its fate with shareholders. 

 Nasdaq owns almost 30 percent of the LSE and is offering 1,243 pence a share in cash for the rest, valuing the operator at 2.7 billion pounds ($5.3 billion). Under UK takeover rules, the bid has until February 10 either to lapse or go unconditional. The number of LSE shareholders who have voted has not been announced. Any increased offer by Nasdaq for LSE would have to have be agreed by both companies. The two exchanges have engaged in a war of words in recent weeks, with Nasdaq criticizing the London exchange for refusing to discuss the prospect of an agreed takeover deal. Earlier this week, LSE rejected the criticism, saying Nasdaq had not sought "constructive discussion with the exchange". The pace of mergers is picking up among the world's stock exchanges as they come under pressure from customers to offer global services and cut fees. Competition is also becoming more intense, with a group of investment banks planning to create a pan-European equity trading platform this year. The LSE has long been a takeover target, in part because of its relatively small market capitalization compared with rivals. Its shares have more than trebled over the past two years as it has received and rejected a string of offers. HEYMAN UPS STAKE By 1416 GMT, LSE shares were up 0.2 percent at 1,285 pence, above the 1,243 pence-a-share offer price from Nasdaq, but they have retreated from an all-time high of 1,311 pence as hopes of a higher offer have waned. U.S. investor Samuel Heyman said he had increased his interest in the LSE to 10.44 percent. His investment vehicles, Heyman Investment Associates and Vesper Holdings, own derivatives such as options and contracts for difference through which he is exposed to LSE's shares. Mamoun Tazi, an analyst at Man Financial, advised clients to sell. "If enough shareholders take profit and drive the shares below 1,243p, then some of the remaining shareholders may be tempted to tender their shares," he said. Nasdaq Chief Executive Bob Greifeld said he was optimistic the bid would succeed. Speaking on Thursday on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum of business and political leaders in Davos, he said he should have a good feel for the level of acceptances next week.
