 LONDON  (Reuters) - U.S. Nasdaq Stock Market Inc said on Friday it had extended to February 10 the deadline for investors to accept its hostile offer worth 2.7 billion pounds ($5.3 billion) for London Stock Exchange Plc. 

 Nasdaq, which owns almost 30 percent of the LSE and is offering 1,243 pence per share in cash for the rest, earlier on Friday renounced the option of agreeing a higher offer with the LSE, saying there was insufficient time for dialogue and for an LSE board recommendation by a deadline of midnight, January 27. Any increased offer by Nasdaq for LSE would have had to have been agreed by the LSE, or come as a response to a bid from another party, since Nasdaq had previously declared its offer as final. Under UK takeover rules, the bid now has until February 10 to succeed or it will lapse. Nasdaq said in a statement that just 0.62 percent of LSE investors accepted its offer so far. LSE said in a response the "very low level of acceptances is in line with the board's view that Nasdaq's offer substantially undervalues the Exchange and fails to reflect its unique strategic position, outstanding financial performance and excellent prospects". LSE shares closed 0.9 percent higher at 1,295 pence. Friday's statements were the latest in a war of words in recent weeks, with Nasdaq criticizing the London exchange for refusing to discuss the prospect of an agreed takeover deal. Earlier this week, LSE rejected the criticism, saying Nasdaq had not sought constructive discussion with the exchange. The pace of mergers is picking up among the world's stock exchanges as they come under pressure from customers to offer global services and cut fees. Competition is also becoming more intense, with a group of investment banks planning to create a pan-European equity trading platform this year. The LSE has long been a takeover target, in part because of its relatively small market capitalization compared with rivals. Its shares have more than trebled over the past two years as it has received and rejected a string of offers. HEYMAN UPS STAKE Also on Friday, U.S. investor Samuel Heyman said he had increased his interest in the LSE to 10.44 percent. His investment vehicles, Heyman Investment Associates and Vesper Holdings, own derivatives such as options and contracts for difference through which he is exposed to LSE's shares. Mamoun Tazi, an analyst at Man Financial, advised clients to sell. "If enough shareholders take profit and drive the shares below 1,243 pence, then some of the remaining shareholders may be tempted to tender their shares," he said. Nasdaq Chief Executive Bob Greifeld said he was optimistic the bid would succeed. Speaking on Thursday on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum of business and political leaders in Davos, he said he should have a good feel for the level of acceptances next week.
