 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - KB Home ( KBH.N ), whose long-time chief stepped down following an internal probe into stock-options awards, said on Friday that U.S. regulators have opened a formal investigation into its options practices, and its shares fell 2 percent. 

 The company, the No. 5 U.S. home builder, received notice of an informal inquiry in August. It said in a regulatory filing on Friday that it was notified on January 19 that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is now conducting a formal investigation. In a formal probe, the SEC has the power to subpoena documents and other information from a company. The investigation takes management's attention away from focusing on strategy to deal with a soft housing market, said analyst John Tomlinson of Majestic Research in New York. It has also helped prevent KB Home from updating investors on its business conditions. "The company hasn't put out final third or fourth quarter earnings estimates partly because of (the probe), and I think this is just going to prolong that even more," Tomlinson said. "We really haven't a chance to see how their quarter was relative to the other builders. It'd be nice to know how sales and orders and the main drivers of the business were going." COOPERATING WITH SEC KB Home "has cooperated with the SEC regarding this matter and intends to continue to do so," the company said in the filing. A spokeswoman said the company had no additional comment. In November, CEO Bruce Karatz retired after 34 years with KB following an internal report that showed the company used incorrect measurement dates for stock option grants from 1998 to 2005. Karatz agreed to repay about $13 million in gains he received from mispriced options. At the time, the company fired its head of Human Resources' employment and its chief legal officer resigned. Karatz, like other heads of publicly traded home-building companies, saw his compensation soar in recent years thanks to the U.S. housing boom. He took in nearly $45.6 million in the fiscal year ended November 30, 2005, including base pay, bonuses, restricted stock and stock option grants, up about 29 percent from $35.3 million in 2004, according to Salary.com, a compensation specialist. KB is among more than 160 U.S. companies that are the focus of government investigations or are undertaking internal probes into options practices. The focus is on options that were backdated to increase their value to recipients, mostly top executives. KB said in December that it expects to restate financial results for 2003 through 2005 and the first half of 2006 because of options pricing errors. It has said it expects a noncash expense of about $41 million spread over several years. KB Home shares were down $1 at $51.12 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
