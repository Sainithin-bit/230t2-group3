 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Dow Jones & Co. Inc. DJ.N will cut an unspecified number of administrative positions in field offices as part of a plan to centralize delivery operations for The Wall Street Journal and Barron's, Dow Jones Newswires reported. 

 The cuts will be offset in part by new positions in regional centers in Massachusetts and New Jersey, Dow Jones reported, citing an internal company memo. Dow Jones Newswires is owned by parent company Dow Jones, which also publishes the Journal, Barron's and the Marketwatch.com Web site. The consolidation reflects Dow Jones' recent move to use subcontractors to deliver the Journal and Barron's to homes and offices, Dow Jones Newswires reported. Dow Jones officials did not return telephone calls and e-mails seeking comment.
