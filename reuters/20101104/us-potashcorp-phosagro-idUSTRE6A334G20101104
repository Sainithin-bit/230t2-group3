 YEKATERINBURG, Russia  (Reuters) - Russian fertilizer producer Phosagro, which emerged as a contender for Potash Corp the same day Canada blocked BHP Billiton's bid, said it would announce a decision on its own bid after November 15. 

 "At the moment Phosagro is in intensive consultations with the Russian government, Russian and foreign banks on a possible deal," the Phosagro press service said. "Phosagro will announce its next move after Nov 15." Phosagro Chairman Vladimir Litvinenko told Reuters on Wednesday he had asked close ally and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin to approve a potential move and examine the financial implications, saying Russian interests were at stake if BHP was allowed to succeed. He said Russia was at risk of losing its own markets if BHP Billiton gained control of world potash supply. But Phosagro would consider taking only a minority stake in Potash rather than staging a full takeover attempt. Phosagro did not comment on Canada's decision to block BHP Billiton's $39 billion bid for Potash Corp. The Anglo-Australian miner has 30 days to produce an alternative but Canada's ruling leaves little room for a modified offer.
