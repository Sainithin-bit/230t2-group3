 LONDON/SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - Commodity prices rose sharply on Thursday as Federal Reserve plans to pump more money into the U.S. economy sparked a slide in the dollar sending oil to a six-month high while sugar and silver scaled 30-year peaks. 

 The U.S. central bank said it would buy $600 billion in government bonds on Wednesday, undermining dollar sentiment. The U.S. unit hit a 28-year low against the Australian dollar. "This is a real dollar depreciation story. When you print money, real assets go up," said Patrick Armstrong, managing partner at Armstrong Investment managers in London. The Reuters-Jefferies CRB index, a global commodities benchmark, rose above 310 points to a two-year high. Crude oil hit a six-month high with the Fed move set to stimulate the economy of the world's top oil user. "As the dollar weakens people start thinking about putting their money into commodities to offset the currency and it's cheaper for importing countries to buy crude," said Roy Jordan, oil analyst at Facts Global Energy. Wide anticipation of the Fed stimulus measures -- meant to avert deflation and create jobs by easing long-term borrowing costs -- in October drove oil prices out of their previous range between $70-$80 a barrel. Top oil exporter Saudi Arabia earlier this week shifted its price range up to $70-$90 a barrel. U.S. crude for December rose almost $2.00 to a peak of $86.68 per barrel, a six-month peak for the benchmark front month. SILVER SOARS Gold soared to within a whisker of its record high while silver climbed to a 30-year peak. "The dollar is basically extremely weak and gold, and other precious metals which follow gold, are moving more like currencies than commodities," said Commerzbank analyst Eugen Weinberg. "Should the dollar weaken further, I wouldn't be surprised to see prices going higher." Spot gold hit a high of $1,381.20 an ounce, up 2 percent and close to its record $1,387.10. Silver rallied to its highest since March 1980, at $25.58 an ounce. Copper on the London Metal Exchange surged to its highest in more than two years. The metal used in power and construction hit $8,580 a ton, its highest since July 2008, when it touched a record $8,940 a ton. "Confirmation of quantitative easing is very helpful for base metals, though it was not unexpected and further weakness in the dollar is also helpful," said John Meyer, analyst at investment bank Fairfax. SUGAR RUSH Raw sugar prices jumped to a 30-year high while refined sugar hit a record with dollar weakness enhancing an already bullish outlook with global supplies tight. "Sugar, the same as corn, inventory levels are very low and on both of those you could potentially see a very significant spike -- not just globally macro driven but also micro supply/demand fundamentals," Armstrong said. ICE front-month March raw sugar futures touched a 30-year high of 31.57 cents while Liffe whites set a record peak of $772.50 a ton. Corn led an advance in grains and oilseed prices on the Chicago Board of Trade as demand, particularly from China, continued to outpace supplies following lower-than-expected yields in the U.S., by far the largest producer. "The supply side is disappointing, the demand recovery is well underway and stock levels are quite tight," said Barclays Capital analyst Sudakshina Unnikrishnan. Chicago Board of Trade December corn was up 1.4 percent to $5.89 per bushel, while CBOT November soybeans rose 1.3 percent to $12.43-1/2 a bushel. CBOT wheat futures were also higher, with December up 9-1/2 cents at $6.99-3/4 a bushel.
