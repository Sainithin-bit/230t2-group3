 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ) expects to start re-filing foreclosure documents in a couple of weeks, according to retail financial services Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf. 

 JPMorgan was among a handful of banks to temporarily suspend home seizures after finding glitches in foreclosure documents. Other banks, including Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) and Ally Financial's GMAC Mortgage unit, recently resumed some foreclosures. The second-largest U.S. bank had halted foreclosure proceedings in 40 states, affecting about 127,000 loans, Scharf told analysts at a conference in Boston on Thursday. JPMorgan has new processes in place to check it is meeting all the requirements in foreclosure proceedings, Scharf said. Separately, Scharf noted that mortgage losses and delinquencies in October had not increased from levels the bank reported September. The bank also said it is receiving large numbers of file requests related to mortgages it sold to investors that may not have met their sales description. Investors have been seeking to put mortgages with faulty paperwork back to the banks. In the presentation, Scharf said the bank has received file requests relating to $8.1 billion in mortgages year-to-date. That compares with requests of $9.2 billion for 2009. The bank has received repurchase demands totaling $2.9 billion so far this year, compared to just over $3 billion in 2009, Scharf said. JPMorgan last month said it has put aside more money against repurchase losses. The bank ended the third quarter with $3 billion in reserve against such losses.
