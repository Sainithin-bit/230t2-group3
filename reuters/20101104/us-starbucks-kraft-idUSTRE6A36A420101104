 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp ( SBUX.O ) informed Kraft Foods Inc KFT.N a month ago that it plans to end a more-than-a-decade-old deal under which Kraft distributes packaged Starbucks coffee to stores and other outlets. 

 Kraft, which also surprised Wall Street with its profit report, said it was too early to say what the impact of the lost agreement would be on its results. "We know this has been on their minds, but we haven't entered into any specific conversations about the when or the why or the how," said Kraft Chief Financial Officer Tim McLevish on a conference call with analysts. "Starbucks intends to work closely with Kraft to ensure an orderly transition," the world's biggest coffee company said in a statement on Thursday, after it reported higher-than-expected quarterly earnings. Kraft -- which itself makes coffee under the Maxwell House brand -- has been distributing packaged coffee for Starbucks since 1998.
