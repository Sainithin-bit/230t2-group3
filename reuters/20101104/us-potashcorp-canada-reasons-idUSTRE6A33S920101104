 OTTAWA  (Reuters) - Canada will fully explain its decisions for blocking BHP Billiton's bid for Potash Corp in early December, Industry Minister Tony Clement said on Thursday. 

 Clement, who shocked markets by blocking the bid on Wednesday, said he was obliged by the Investment Canada Act to keep his reasons silent until the end of a 30-day review period. "I'm quite anxious to enunciate the reasons ... the specific clauses within the legislation that are the basis of the decision," he told the House of Commons. "I am forbidden to do so until the 30-day period is up but believe me, I will do so with alacrity at that moment." (Reporting by  David Ljunggren ; Editing by Frank McGurty)
