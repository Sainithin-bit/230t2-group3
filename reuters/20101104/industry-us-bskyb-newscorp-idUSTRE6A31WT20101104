 LONDON  (Reuters) - Britain's business minister has asked the UK communications regulator to examine News Corp's proposed buyout of BSkyB, although several analysts expect the deal ultimately to go ahead. 

 News Corp, led by Chief Executive Rupert Murdoch, is proposing to buy the 61 percent of the British satellite broadcaster it does not already own for 7.8 billion pounds ($12.5 billion) to consolidate a business it helped build. The U.S. media conglomerate also owns newspapers in Britain including The Times and The Sun -- the country's best-selling tabloid, which supported Prime Minister David Cameron during this year's election campaign. Given News Corp's vast influence in Britain, there had been mounting public pressure on the government to vet the deal. "On the basis of the information and submissions available to me, I have decided that it is appropriate to issue an intervention notice in this particular case," Business Secretary Vince Cable said in a statement on Thursday. "The independent experts at Ofcom will now investigate and report to me on the media plurality issues that may arise from this proposed acquisition." Murdoch's company said the deal would not have a detrimental impact on British media. "News Corp is confident that the proposed investment will not adversely affect media plurality in the United Kingdom and looks forward to discussing any substantive issues with the relevant authorities," the company said in statement. DEAL ALSO UNDER EU SCRUTINY News Corp officially informed the European Union of its proposal on Wednesday, and EU competition regulators will also examine the matter -- on grounds of competition -- deciding by December 8 whether to clear the bid. BSkyB shares dipped 0.1 percent to 705 pence by 0920 GMT. Several analysts said that News Corp was likely to ultimately get its way and get full control of BSkyB. "The market still believes that the deal will go through," said Conor O'Shea, an analyst at brokerage Kepler. "My own view is that News Corp will ultimately achieve its goals with the current Sky share price (representing a sound bid level)," added Mike Jeremy, an analyst at Daniel Stewart brokerage. "Therefore today's statement should be viewed as part of an ongoing dialogue," said Jeremy. Lawyers also said the decision was not surprising given the degree of political interest and outright opposition from certain quarters. Competing media groups, including the BBC, have voiced their opposition to the deal. Oliver W. Bretz, a partner at law firm Clifford Chance, said Ofcom would only focus on the plurality issues as the European Commission was responsible for the competition side. "This really comes down to whether BSkyB currently has a material degree of independence," he said. Cable will decide whether to refer the matter to Britain's own Competition Commission after receiving the Ofcom report, which is due by December 31. BSkyB and News Corp first said in June that they were in talks about a possible takeover. News Corp, which owns 39 percent of BSkyB, proposed paying 7.8 billion pounds, or 700 pence per share, for the BSkyB stock it does not own. BSkyB's independent directors rejected the bid as too low, saying they would be prepared to support an offer above 800 pence. The two parties then agreed to seek regulatory approval before further price negotiations.
