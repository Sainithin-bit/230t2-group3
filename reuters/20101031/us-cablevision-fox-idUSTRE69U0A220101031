 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Cablevision Systems Corp and News Corp have a reached a programing deal which sees the return of the Fox local stations to more than three million New York area homes after a 15-day blackout. 

 The Fox stations and some of its sister cable networks, NatGeo Wild and Fox Desportes, disappeared off the systems of Cablevision after the cable operator was unable to reach a deal with Fox over a price rise in programing fees. With either side refusing to back down, Cablevision customers ended up missing some of their favorite shows and sports including the ongoing World Series baseball championship. The companies said signals were returned to Cablevision ahead of the third game of the series on Saturday. Terms of the new deal were not disclosed. In a series of PR and advertising campaigns, Cablevision had claimed News Corp had been demanding to more than double its fee to $150 million from $70 million. (Reporting by  Yinka Adegoke )
