 LONDON  (Reuters) - BHP Billiton ( BHP.AX ) is planning to raise its $39 billion hostile bid for Canada's Potash Corp ( POT.TO ), the world's largest fertilizer supplier, the Sunday Times reported, citing sources close to the situation. 

 A London-based spokesman for BHP Billiton ( BLT.L ) declined to comment. The paper said BHP is considering raising its $130 a share offer by 10 percent. BHP launched its bid in August, but Potash Corp's stock has consistently changed hands well above the bid price, signaling expectations of a sweetened bid. The shares ( POT.N ) closed on Friday at $145.09 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by  Julie Crust ; editing by  Michael Shields )
