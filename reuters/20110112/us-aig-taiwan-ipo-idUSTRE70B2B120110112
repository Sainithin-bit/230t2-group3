 TAIPEI  (Reuters) - The head of the group buying AIG's Taiwan unit said on Wednesday it may consider a share offer and promised not to sell the business for 10 years. 

 Samuel Yin, chairman of Ruen Chen Investment, a group comprising Ruentex Industries Ltd and shoe maker Pou Chen Corp, also told a media briefing he was confident the deal would pass regulators. Earlier on Wednesday AIG said it had agreed to sell Nan Shan to Ruen Chen for $2.16 billion. Yin is also chairman of the Ruentex Group, parent of Ruentex Industries. (Reporting by Rachel Lee )
