 (Reuters) - American International Group Inc has accepted a $2.16 billion offer for its Taiwan Nan Shan Life unit from a group led by local conglomerate Ruentex Group. 

 Following are some facts about Nan Shan: -- Nan Shan is Taiwan's No.3 life insurer by market share, behind the life insurance units of financial holding firms Cathay Financial and Fubon Financial. -- Founded in 1963, Nan Shan has 4 million policy holders, or about one-sixth of Taiwan's 23 million population. Its assets were T$1.7 trillion ($53 billion) as of June 2010. -- Nan Shan lost T$12.5 billion in the third quarter of last year and T$12.7 billion in the second. For the full year of 2009, the firm reported a net profit of T$10.6 billion. -- Nan Shan has about 30,000 sales agents, one of the largest numbers in the local insurance industry. The huge sales force had become a burden for AIG, in part because of union demands that all the different types of employee pensions were protected. -- AIG put Nan Shan up for sale in 2009 as part of efforts to raise cash and repay the U.S. government for its bailout. -- Taiwan's regulators rejected an original bid by Hong Kong-listed battery maker China Strategic and Hong Kong investment firm Primus because the two did not meet criteria on experience in the insurance business and ability to raise funds for future operations. -- That deal had sparked protests from politicians and unions over the buyer group's political connections with mainland China and over fears jobs would be cut.
