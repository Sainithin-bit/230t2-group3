 LISBON  (Reuters) - The trauma of past IMF interventions is deeply etched in the memory of many Portuguese and explains why applying for assistance would be so politically fraught for Lisbon and is dogging a presidential election race. 

 Memories of the hardship involved in two previous IMF programs in the 1970s and 1980s -- after Portugal emerged from decades of military rule -- go a long way to explain why avoiding a bailout is such a matter of national pride. Most economists and market analysts polled by Reuters believe Lisbon will have no choice but to apply for EU-IMF financial assistance soon in the footsteps of Greece and Ireland because its borrowing costs are becoming prohibitive. But Socialist Prime Minister Jose Socrates cloaked his determination to avoid a bailout in patriotic terms on Tuesday, saying speculation about a rescue "hurts our interests". The issue has taken center-stage in the campaign for the country's largely figurehead presidency, with both leading candidates trying to use it to discredit his rival. Center-right President Anibal Cavaco Silva, widely expected to be re-elected on January 23, turned talk of a looming IMF rescue against the Socialists on Tuesday, saying: "It is very clear, if the IMF enters, the government has failed." Socialist contender Manuel Alegre, who opinion polls suggest will not force Cavaco Silva into a run-off ballot, challenged his opponent to suspend the campaign to deal with the issue of a potential bailout. "This is about defending national sovereignty and rights against the pressures of faceless powers," Alegre said. DEMOCRACY'S CONQUESTS While many Greeks and Irish detested their government's decisions to take bailouts, in Portugal the issue goes to the heart of the relatively young democracy's social progress after it shook off one of Europe's longest dictatorships. The end of the 48-year regime of strongman Antonio Salazar in 1974 breathed fresh life into a country that had been isolated and economically backward for decades. Portugal veered initially to the left, introducing far-reaching social benefits that the rest of western Europe had enjoyed for years. But the honeymoon was short-lived and to many Portuguese, the IMF's intervention symbolized the failure of the initial hopes of the 'Carnation Revolution' that ended military rule, said political analyst Antonio Costa Pinto of Lisbon University. "It marked the end of the social conquests for large parts of society," he said, referring to the 1977 IMF program that entailed spending cuts, lost purchasing power for many and a currency devaluation. "It was a classic Latin American-style recipe, it created instant disillusionment with the re-establishment of capitalism." The IMF returned in 1983 bringing another dose of austerity. Popular memories of those interventions in what remains western Europe's poorest country with one of its widest income gaps explains why the Portuguese only talk about "the IMF coming", even if a bailout would be led by the European Union. Emotions surrounding the issue are sure to remain high as the presidential ballot approaches even though it is the government that would make any final decision. Wounded pride could give way another strong Portuguese trait, a tradition of resignation to a sad fate summed up in its fado music. Portugal's head of state has a mostly ceremonial role but has one key constitutional power -- he can fire the government. However, Cavaco Silva has not so far threatened to use that power against Socrates if he were to take a bailout. If the prime minister does have to yield and seek a bailout, he could still argue that the government was denied enough time to implement its tough 2011 budget to fix the situation, said Andre Freire, a political analyst at the ISCTE institute. "If it (a bailout) happens now, in coming days or weeks, without the government having had time to implement its budget and measures, it would be unjust to say it failed," Freire said. What is sure, is that if foreign financiers are invited in, the disenchantment with politicians is likely to be similar to what it was under the IMF the last time around. "If we had good politicians we wouldn't need this (foreign aid)," said Celeste, a chestnut seller in Lisbon. (Editing by Paul Taylor)
