 (Reuters) - American International group (AIG) has agreed to sell its Taiwan unit Nan Shan Life to a group led by local conglomerate the Ruentex Group for $2.16 billion, bringing closer to an end a troubled and protracted sale process. 

 The deal remains subject to final regulatory approval. Following is a chronology of the sale process: Oct 13, 2009: AIG agrees to sell Nan Shan to conglomerate China Strategic and Hong Kong investment firm Primus Financial for $2.15 billion, with the deal subject to regulatory clearance and a July 12, 2010 deadline for completion. Nov 17, 2009: Losing bidder Chinatrust Financial, after considering a legal challenge, agrees with China Strategic to take a 30 percent stake in Nan Shan when the deal is approved and to sell a 9.95 percent stake in itself to China Strategic. Nov 26, 2009: The-then head of Taiwan regulator the Financial Supervisory Commission tells Chinatrust to "think carefully" about its deal, warning it might complicate the review process. Jan 12, 2010: The buyer group formally submits documents to Taiwan's Investment Commission, kicking off the review process. March 11, 2010: In an unusual move, Taiwan's parliament discusses the deal, highlighting the political sensitivities surrounding the buyer group's mainland China connections. Protesters outside parliament oppose Chinese involvement and call for their jobs to be protected. June 5, 2010: China Strategic Chief Executive Raymond Or says he has quit his post on China's top political advisory body to try and avoid any further delays on the bid. June 11, 2010: AIG and the buyer group agree to put $325 million into an escrow account for four years to serve as extra capital for Nan Shan, a move seen as another attempt to kick-start the regulatory process and soothe concerns. June 21, 2010: Buyers extend the deadline of the deal by three months to October 12. China Strategic's Or says the company is doing its best to meet constant demands from regulators. June 25, 2010: Chinatrust's agreement for a stake in Nan Shan expires and China Strategic decides not to pursue it further, saying it has complicated the review process. July 6, 2010: Chinatrust says it would bid again for Nan Shan if the China Strategic deal is not approved. July 9, 2010; China Strategic's Or announces he will not take a seat on Nan Shan's board. Aug 11, 2010: AIG CEO Robert Benmosche visits Taiwan's financial regulators. Aug 31, 2010: Regulators reject the China Strategic/Primus bid on grounds the two did not meet criteria on experience in the insurance industry and the ability to raise funds for future operations. Sept 20, 2010: Buyers formally terminate the sale process, deciding not to appeal the regulator's decision. Nov 12, 2010: AIG says it hopes to sell Nan Shan within two months, for about the same price it had received the first time. Nov 22, 2010: Four bidders are invited to conduct due diligence: Chinatrust, Fubon Financial, Cathay Financial and the chairman of Ruentex participating via a holding firm set up for the bid. Dec 3, 2010: All four confirmed they would bid. A fifth bidder also reportedly took part, but no details were available. Jan 4, 2011: AIG receives an alternative proposal from Taiwan Secom Group, offering to jointly run Nan Shan with AIG and list it in Taiwan. AIG tells U.S. regulators that bids for Nan Shan were between $2.
