 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Stormy U.S. weather has taken its toll on commuters and travelers this winter, and it could also hit some company earnings for the final quarter. 

 Unexpected steep claims from storms in the fourth quarter could mean insurer Allstate Corp ( ALL.N ) will miss consensus estimates when it reports results next month, according to the latest data from Thomson Reuters StarMine. "It caused a lot of analysts to move their estimates lower on Allstate," said Sri Raman, senior quantitative research analyst at Thomson Reuters. As a result, Allstate's earnings estimate from StarMine, which weights forecasts according to analyst accuracy, is 18 percent below that of the consensus estimate, calculated by Thomson Reuters. Standard & Poor's 500  .SPX  earnings are expected to rise 32 percent compared with a year earlier, and analysts expect that overall the majority of companies will beat estimates. In a similar situation to Allstate's, media company Cinemark Holdings Inc ( CNK.N ) also has a good chance of missing estimates as the late-December blizzard kept consumers out the theaters over the holidays, Raman said. The blizzard kept many people home for two days just after the Christmas holiday and caused traveling delays for several days. StarMine's Cinemark estimate is 15.3 percent below the consensus. On the flip side, Deckers Outdoor Corp ( DECK.O ), which makes UGG boots, is expected to have benefited from the season's good dose of cool weather, Raman said. Deckers' StarMine estimate is 1.4 percent above the consensus estimate. Improved consumer demand may have also helped earnings for credit card company American Express ( AXP.N ), whose StarMine estimate is 6 percent above the consensus one. "The number of bad debts is down, and the consumer is strong in spending," Raman said. Carmax, too, should have a positive surprise when it comes to earnings. The StarMine estimate is 2.8 percent above consensus. Among airlines, Delta Air Line ( DAL.N ) has a StarMine earnings estimate 13 percent below the consensus one, while Alaska Air Group ( ALK.N ) has a StarMine estimate 21.1 percent above consensus.
