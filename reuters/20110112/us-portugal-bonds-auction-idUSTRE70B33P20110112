 LISBON  (Reuters) - Debt-ridden Portugal passed a key market test on Wednesday selling its benchmark 10-year bond at a lower yield than in the previous auction while demand was strong, lifting some pressure off the country to seek a bailout. 

 Portugal sold a total of 1.249 billion euros ($1.62 billion) in two bond maturities -- at the very top end of the initially indicated offer of 1.25 billion euros -- in its first bond sale of the year. "I think Portugal has passed this test, though of course the pressure is not off just yet. There was good volume sold, right at the top of the indicative amount," said Orlando Green, debt strategist at Credit Agricole in London. The average yield on the June 2020 bond fell to 6.716 percent from 6.806 percent in the previous sale in November. The October 2014 bond yielded 5.396 percent, up from 4.041 percent in October's auction, but below secondary market rates. Demand outstripped supply by 3.2 times on the 10-year paper, and by 2.6 times on the four-year maturity. "The strong demand shows that there is still appetite, and it shows there are sufficient investors out there who think Portugal and the euro zone can solve the country's problems before a possible bailout," he said. Portugal is widely seen as the next euro zone weakling to seek EU financial assistance after Greece and Ireland. Finance Minister Fernando Teixeira dos Santos told Reuters the auction was a success, with 80 percent of demand coming from abroad, and the country will continue to finance itself in the markets. RBS rate strategist in London, Harvinder Sian, said the drop in the yield came after a steep tightening in the secondary market spreads before the auction, apparently thanks to bond purchases by the European Central Bank. "These are good results. The drop in the yield is not that unexpected given what's been going on in the secondary market. We've heard the ECB has been buying there before the auction," he said. "6.8 percent is still not too good though, it's a rather high cost," he added. (Reporting by Andrei Khalip and Shrikesh Laxmidas; Editing by Ruth Pitchford and Toby Chopra)
