 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve plans to purchase $600 billion in longer-term Treasury bonds through June to support the U.S. economic recovery. 

 The U.S. central bank has said the policy, known as QE2 because it is the Fed's second round of quantitative easing, will be reevaluated regularly. The following are some recent comments from Fed policymakers (* denotes 2011 voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets U.S. monetary policy): * DALLAS FED PRESIDENT RICHARD FISHER, January 12 "Barring some unexpected shock to the economy or financial system, I think we have reached our limit. I would be wary of further expanding our balance sheet." * MINNEAPOLIS FED PRESIDENT NARAYANA KOCHERLAKOTA, January 11 "There is little or no economic theory to support a connection between monetary policy, as typically conducted in the United States, and bubble formation." * PHILADELPHIA FED PRESIDENT CHARLES PLOSSER, January 11 "The aggressiveness of our accommodative policy may soon backfire on us if we don't begin to gradually reverse course." ATLANTA FED PRESIDENT DENNIS LOCKHART, January 10 "The economy seems to have gained durable momentum as we begin 2011 ... While things are looking better, I don't expect a quick fix." * DALLAS FED PRESIDENT RICHARD FISHER, January 10 "I expect the program (QE2) to be carried through." * MINNEAPOLIS FED PRESIDENT NARAYANA KOCHERLAKOTA, January 10 "The bar is very high for me," Kocherlakota said, on what it would take to consider stopping short the Fed's planned $600 billion bond-purchase program. "There would have to be a disorderly reaction of some kind in inflation expectations or in the behavior of the dollar." * FED BOARD VICE CHAIR JANET YELLEN, January 8 "It will not be a panacea, but I believe it will be effective in fostering maximum employment and price stability," she said of QE2. * CHICAGO FED PRESIDENT CHARLES EVANS, January 7 "I'm keeping an open mind about the $600 billion and beyond that." * FED CHAIRMAN BEN BERNANKE, January 7 "We have seen increased evidence that a self-sustaining recovery in consumer and business spending may be taking hold ... Persistently high unemployment, by damping household income and confidence, could threaten the strength and sustainability of the recovery." * FED GOVERNOR ELIZABETH DUKE, January 7 On the bond-buying program, she said there is "accumulating evidence that these and other asset purchases were successful in exerting downward pressure on long-term interest rates." * CHICAGO FED PRESIDENT CHARLES EVANS, January 7 "With unemployment too high and inflation too low -- and both forecast to stay that way over the next two years -- we have missed on both of our policy objectives ... Accommodative monetary policy continues to be necessary for achieving each of these goals. KANSAS CITY FED PRESIDENT THOMAS HOENIG, January 6 "I believe these actions risk creating a new set of imbalances, or bubbles."
