 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - The European Commission and euro zone countries are discussing changes to the size and scope of operations of the European Financial Stability Facility, Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn said. 

 "It is important to prepare the forthcoming decision profoundly and well," Rehn told reporters on the sidelines of an economic conference on Wednesday. "It is now work in progress. We are working together with the member states to reach a decision," he said. He would not elaborate on the details of the potential changes, saying it would be premature as discussions were ongoing. Asked if the success or failure of Portugal's bond auction on Wednesday could be key to the country requesting financial aid from the EU and the International Monetary Fund, Rehn said: "We are following the events in Portugal. Portugal has taken very bold fiscal measures in the context of this year's budget and has announced substantial structural measures as well. Also the fiscal data of last year was quite positive." "Portugal is on the right path now in terms of taking bold action on fiscal consolidation and pursuing structural reforms," Rehn said. Asked if Spain could also be forced to seek EU financing, Rehn said: "Spain has taken very substantial fiscal measures, is putting forward very significant structural reforms, restructuring the banking sector, it is advancing its pension reform as well as the reform of the labor market -- these are very convincing actions and I am sure that Spain can turn the corner with these measures."
