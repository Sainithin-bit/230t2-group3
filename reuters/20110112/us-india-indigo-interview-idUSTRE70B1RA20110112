 MUMBAI  (Reuters) - Indian budget carrier IndiGo is considering all options including a possible initial public offering to finance a $15.6 billion deal with Airbus, but has made no decision yet, the firm's president said on Wednesday. 

 Taking advantage of booming demand from a burgeoning middle class in Asia's third-largest economy, IndiGo on Tuesday agreed to buy 180 planes from Airbus in the largest jet order in commercial aviation history. IndiGo will get the first delivery of the order in 2015, after it procures all 100 planes from a previous order, Aditya Ghosh told Reuters in an interview. Ghosh also said IndiGo would start international flights to the Middle East, South-east Asia and South Asia around September of this year, once it completes five years of operation, making it eligible for overseas routes. Owned by InterGlobe Enterprises and industry veteran Rakesh Gangwal, a former chief executive of U.S. Airways ( LCC.N ), IndiGo is the third-largest Indian domestic carrier by market share.
