 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Comcast Corp ( CMCSA.O ), the largest U.S. cable operator, is undervalued and the market is overreacting to fears that consumers are jumping to satellite television, Barron's said in its September 24 edition. 

 Comcast broadband service is making rapid gains as cable's share of residential broadband net subscriber additions is up to 54 percent from 49 percent a year ago, the financial newspaper said. "The cable operators, for all the hand wringing, are growing at their strongest growth rate in a decade," Bernstein Research analyst Craig Moffett told Barron's. The company should spend an increasingly small portion of its revenue on capital spending, which should expand free cash flow, Moffett told Barron's. Philadelphia-based Comcast is leading the charge by U.S. cable operators to win subscribers from phone companies by aggressively marketing its bundled television, high-speed Internet and phone services.
