 PARIS  (Reuters) - ECB chief Jean-Claude Trichet said on Sunday he favored allowing financial market actors to draw up a voluntary code of conduct on transparency as part of efforts to avoid a repeat of recent market turmoil. 

 Trichet said it was too early to draw definitive conclusions about the global credit crunch but welcomed closer cooperation between European banking supervisors, even though he was skeptical about the need for a single supervisory body. The global credit crisis began in the U.S. subprime mortgage sector, where home loans made to borrowers with poor credit records were repackaged and sold on as asset-backed securities to institutional investors around the world, including hedge funds. "We have to draw the necessary conclusions in terms of transparency of all markets, including the transparency of very sophisticated instruments," Trichet said in a live interview on TV5 television and Europe 1 radio. "We have to draw conclusions on the rating agencies, which played a role, on all the entities which one can say are not supervised, the famous hedge funds, the private equity funds ... the special vehicles," he said. "I would personally be in favor of allowing these industries themselves to draw up a code of conduct, or better conduct, so that we can see what they are capable of doing voluntarily." At a meeting of EU finance ministers and central bankers in Portugal this month to discuss the credit crisis, the ECB received praise for pumping emergency funding into money markets to prevent them seizing up totally. Trichet said on Sunday he welcomed moves towards closer cooperation between European banking supervisors as a result of the recent turmoil, and said it should be stepped up. But he added: "I would not say at this stage that the ECB would be in favor of a single regulator and a single supervisory authority, but is certainly (in favor) of a great improvement in the close cooperation."
