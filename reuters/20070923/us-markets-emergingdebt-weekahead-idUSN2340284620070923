 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Emerging sovereign debt investors will look to core market movements for direction in the coming week, with some analysts expecting a further tightening of credit spreads, albeit not all at once. 

 JP Morgan's Emerging Markets Bond Index Global 11EML showed yield spreads tightened by 26.55 basis points in the week that ended September 21, as markets rallied in the wake of the U.S. Federal Reserve's half percentage point cut in the target federal funds rate. The benchmark now stands at 4.75 percent. The JP Morgan EMBI Plus tightened 27.92 basis points in the week ending September 21. The lingering impact of the Fed's aggressive interest rate cut is helping the sector recover ground lost in the credit market turmoil because lower rates historically spur growth. But lower rates can also stoke higher inflation, putting central banks on notice. For the commodity-exporting emerging market countries, there is a window of opportunity to draw in more cash before economic growth begins to slow. "The entire Latin America region is in better condition to absorb external shocks. Growth depends mostly on domestic drivers and commodities on an historical basis are still very high. Around 41 percent of exports from Latin America is commodities," said Luis Oganes, head of Latin American economics and strategy at JP Morgan in New York. "We have a year-end target range of 185-200 basis points on the EMBI Global. We are now at 208. There is probably more of a rally in that respect, but between now and year end, it is unlikely to be a straight line. The 50-basis-point cut is not a magic bullet that will cure or solve all the structural problems that led to all this turbulence to begin with," he added. Emerging market investors are looking more intently at how U.S. stock markets are trading as a barometer for risk appetite. Last week the S&P500 stock index  .SPX  rose 2.8 percent. "Next week is very quiet on the G7 front, so I think emerging markets will be left to trade on news flow," said Nick Chamie, head of emerging markets research at RBC Capital Markets in Toronto. Looking outside of the Latin American region, Turkey and South Africa report their trade data next Friday. Both countries have high current account deficits, leaving them vulnerable to market volatility. Additionally, South Africa's August inflation data will be a crucial element in determining monetary policy. The central bank warned on Thursday that it will "act decisively" to counter emerging, broader price pressures.
