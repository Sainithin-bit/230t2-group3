 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co GT.N said on Wednesday it will close a tire plant in Australia by the end of 2008, cutting 600 jobs, under its long-term plan to eliminate high-cost production capacity. 

 Goodyear, the largest U.S. tire maker, also said it had completed a three-year restructuring goal of eliminating 25 million tires of annual production from higher-cost countries to save the company about $150 million per year in costs. Goodyear said it expects after-tax charges of about $125 million for the plant closings, including $75 million in the second quarter. The closing of the plant in Somerton, Victoria, will save about $35 million annually, it said. The Akron, Ohio-based tire maker said it would focus on increasing production of high-value tires in low-cost operations to support growth in the Asia-Pacific market. Goodyear has previously announced plant closings in the United States, Canada, New Zealand and England. It has scheduled an investor meeting for Thursday in New York. Goodyear has focused on selling a higher percentage of more expensive tires and has been able to raise prices in recent years to more than make up for rising costs for materials such as rubber, petroleum-based commodities and steel. The company has about 70,000 employees worldwide. (Reporting by  David Bailey ; editing by  Mark Porter  and Carol Bishopric)
