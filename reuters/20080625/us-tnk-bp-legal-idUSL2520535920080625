 LONDON  (Reuters) - The Russian shareholders in TNK-BP have threatened legal action in Russia and internationally in their dispute with British oil major BP Plc ( BP.L ) and said labor union unrest could follow. 

 The measures were outlined in a presentation to be delivered by Stan Polovets, chief executive of the Alfa-Access-Renova (AAR) consortium representing the Russian billionaire co-owners, in London, and which was distributed in advance by AAR. BP is locked in dispute with its Russian partners over control of the joint venture, which is Russia's third largest oil producer. TNK-BP TNBPI.RTS has endured raids on its offices by security forces, the arrest of staff, tax probes and difficulties in securing visa for secondees from BP in recent months. BP has blamed its partners for the problems. (Reporting by  Tom Bergin ; Editing by  David Holmes )
