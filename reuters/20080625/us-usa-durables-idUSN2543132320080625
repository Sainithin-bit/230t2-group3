 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - New orders for long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods were unchanged in May after two consecutive months of decline, government data on Wednesday showed, while a key barometer of business investment fell by less than expected. 

  KEY POINTS: * Non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending, fell by 0.8 percent in May. * This was somewhat less than analyst forecasts for a 1.4 percent drop but followed a 3.1 percent rise in April, revised down from a previously reported 4.0 percent gain. COMMENTS: SCOTT BROWN, CHIEF ECONOMIST WITH RAYMOND JAMES &  ASSOCIATES IN ST PETERSBURG, FLORIDA: "The numbers are so noisy. The ex-transportation number was a bit disappointing, but it's no big shakes. The overall trend (in durable goods data) has been fairly moderate, which seems to fly in the face of a lot of anecdotal evidence we are getting that business spending is slowing down." RONALD SIMPSON, DIRECTOR OF FX RESEARCH AT ACTION ECONOMICS  IN TAMPA, FLORIDA: "The headline (number) was pretty close to expectations, some of the components were a little better than perhaps some had expected. I don't see much reaction to these numbers at all given that the FOMC announcement is this afternoon. The dollar is going to trade pretty much sideways through 2:15 this afternoon." GARY THAYER, SENIOR ECONOMIST, WACHOVIA SECURITIES, ST.  LOUIS, MISSOURI: "Overall, the number was a little better than expected and the details of the report suggest that there is some underlying strength in areas like computers, electronics and electrical equipment. That's an indication that outside of housing, other parts of the economy are doing better. "Shipments of non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, which is a proxy for business investment spending, was up for a third consecutive month which suggests that companies are not significantly cutting their capital spending at this time. Part of this could be related to exports, but it still suggests that American companies are not a significant drag on the economy yet even though profits have been squeezed by rising costs." MARKET REACTION: * BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices remain lower * CURRENCIES: U.S. dollar remains down slightly against the euro and up slightly against the yen * STOCKS: U.S. equity index futures remain higher * RATE FUTURES: Fed fund futures steady, showing a 74 percent chance of a rate hike at the Fed's meeting in August.
