 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Department store operator J.C. Penney Co Inc ( JCP.N ) said on Wednesday it will reduce the number of stores it opens or renovates next year as it grapples with the weak retail environment. 

 The retailer added it still expects gross margin trends to improve in the second half of this year as it controls inventory levels and operating expenses, and its shares were up more than 4.5 percent. The Plano, Texas, company now expects 2009 capital expenditures of $650 million, versus $1 billion expected for 2008 and $1.2 billion spent in 2007. In 2009, 20 new or relocated stores will be opened, compared with 36 planned for 2008. The company said its previous plans called for the opening of 50 stores each year through 2011. In a statement, J.C. Penney Chairman Myron Ullman said the retailer expected the coming year "to remain very challenging for the American consumer." Department store sales have suffered as higher gasoline and food costs lead customers to cut their discretionary spending and reduce shopping mall visits. J.C. Penney also said it plans to renovate 10 to 15 stores in 2009, compared with 20 remodels expected this year and down from previous plans to overhaul 65 stores annually through 2011. The retailer added it expects total inventories to fall below 2007 levels by the end of this year's back-to-school season. Year-over-year gross margin trends are still expected to improve in the third and fourth quarters, it added. J.C. Penney shares were up $1.65, or 4.5 percent, to $38.53 in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
