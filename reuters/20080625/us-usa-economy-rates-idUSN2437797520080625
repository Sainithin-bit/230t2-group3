 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve is not likely to raise U.S. interest rates until later this year or sometime in 2009, when the economy is seen picking up steam, a securities industry group said on Tuesday. 

 The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association's economic advisory panel said in its semiannual forecast that the U.S. economy looked set to grow just 1.6 percent this year and a still-soft 1.9 percent in 2009. The median forecast for next year from the panel of top Wall Street economists reflects an expected pickup in growth to 2.5 percent in the second half of the year. "The U.S. economy will continue to encounter stiff headwinds through 2008, but begin to revive in 2009," Steve Davidson, SIFMA's managing director of capital market research, said in a statement. The Fed has cut benchmark interest rates by 3.25 percentage points since mid-September to help buffer the economy from a deep housing downturn and tight credit, but policy-makers have signaled growing concerns on inflation. However, they are widely expected to hold benchmark overnight rates steady at 2 percent at a two-day meeting that concludes on Wednesday. "Once the Fed sees the economy stabilizing, they would feel more comfortable raising rates as protection or an 'insurance policy' against inflation and inflationary expectations," Davidson added. The panelists expect inflation, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures price index, to reach 3.3 percent this year, but look for it to fall back to 2.2 percent in 2009. About 80 percent of the advisory group members expects tax rebate checks under a government economic stimulus program will add more than 0.5 percentage point to GDP growth in the second half of this year. Most of the respondents expect housing prices to "hit bottom" and begin to recover nationally some time in 2009, with the majority expecting housing sales to begin rising in the second half of 2008.
