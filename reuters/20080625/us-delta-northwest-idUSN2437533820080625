 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - If executives at Delta Air Lines ( DAL.N ) and Northwest Airlines NWA.N are confident their planned merger can shore up the two embattled carriers, a steep decline in shares says investors are far from convinced that consolidation is the key to offsetting record high fuel prices. 

 Since the pair announced plans to form the world's largest airline, shares of each carrier has fallen about 50 percent, a little more than the sector as a whole. That's a strong statement about investor confidence in the industry, which, in addition to the historic merger, is downsizing aggressively to cope with record high oil prices, which are approaching $140 a barrel. "Investors are clearly signaling that the rise in oil is so pervasive and significant that it's more than offset any benefits from capacity cuts or mergers or revenue increases," said Standard & Poors equity analyst Jim Corridore. "Airlines have done everything that they can do," he said. "They're just a victim of the circumstances that they find themselves in." Delta and Northwest's combination, which will be known as Delta, features the combination of their end-to-end networks, which the carriers say will produce benefits amounting to about $1 billion a year in annual savings and revenue. "These synergies will strengthen the merged airline in any economic environment. However, if oil prices remain high, the synergies enable us to offset increased fuel costs -- a benefit not available to either carrier on a stand-alone basis," Delta Chief Executive Richard Anderson and Northwest CEO Doug Steenland said in a letter to the Wall Street Journal published on Wednesday. WISE MOVE Experts tend to agree that the Delta/Northwest merger is a wise move, even if stock prices don't reflect much optimism. "The revenue potential for the expanded network will be achieved sooner and will overall be greater than either an alliance ... or no change to the network," said airline consultant Robert Mann. When the carriers unveiled merger plans in April, skeptics complained that the proposal featured none of the sweeping capacity cuts needed to save the ailing airline industry. Nevertheless, experts predicted at the time that a wave of consolidation would follow. The wave never came, but a string of deep capacity cuts did. Top carriers like AMR Corp's AMR.N American and UAL Corp's UAUA.O have recently announced major capacity cuts and layoffs. Last week, Delta and Northwest also announced large cuts, a move that many think will lead to a more efficient business and higher fares. "Mergers are only a small part of the solution with $140 fuel. It's really icing on the cake," said Joe Schweiterman, a transportation expert at DePaul University in Chicago. "Mergers produce modest gains at a time when airlines need a much bigger solution," he said. Analysts agree that the industry needs to cut its capacity by about 20 percent to gain stability. Experts such as Stuart Klaskin at KKC Aviation say capacity reduction is far more important than consolidation in the fight to shore up the airline industry. "It's good that these other carriers have not had this headlong rush to consolidate the way we though we were going to see," Klaskin said. (Editing by  Brian Moss )
