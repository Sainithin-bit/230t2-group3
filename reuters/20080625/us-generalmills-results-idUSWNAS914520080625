 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - General Mills Inc ( GIS.N ) on Wednesday reported a fall in fourth-quarter net earnings and said it expects costs to rise 9 percent in the current fiscal year as the food industry faces a continued increase in prices for grain, energy and other commodities. 

 But the maker of Cheerios cereal, Yoplait yogurt and Progresso soup said excluding a charge for the change in market value of commodity positions it holds, profit for the fourth quarter ended May 25 rose, matching amounts it had said it expected to report last week. Price increases helped boost sales and offset the impact of soaring commodity costs. The maker of Cheerios cereal, Yoplait yogurt and Progresso soup said net profit was $185.2 million, or 53 cents a share, in the fiscal fourth quarter, down from $224.1 million, or 62 cents a share, last year. Excluding the reduction in the value of commodity positions, earnings were 73 cents a share. Analysts on average were expecting the company to earn 73 cents a share, excluding special items, according to Reuters Estimates. Like other food companies, General Mills has had to cope with soaring costs for commodities like wheat and energy. The company has raised prices and found a variety of ways to cut costs while still investing in marketing and product development. In the quarter, sales rose 13 percent to $3.5 billion. General Mills repeated its forecast for fiscal 2009 earnings, which it said last week should be between $3.78 a share and $3.83 a share, assuming no impact from changes in the value of its commodity holdings. Analysts' average forecast is $3.79. For fiscal 2009, it forecast sales to grow at a mid-single-digit rate.
