 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve held 
a key interest rate steady on Wednesday and voiced greater 
concern about inflation, taking a step down a road that could 
lead to higher borrowing costs. 

 
KEY POINTS:  * The decision by the U.S. central bank, announced at the end 
of a two-day meeting, leaves the benchmark federal funds rate 
at 2 percent.  * It was the first time the Fed has held rates steady at a 
policy-setting session since embarking on a series of rate 
reductions in September to put a floor under an economy hit 
hard by a housing downturn and credit crisis.  
COMMENTS: 
GREG SALVAGGIO, VICE PRESIDENT OF TRADING, TEMPUS CONSULTING, 
WASHINGTON: "It's a bit more hawkish than people were whispering about. 
Certainly, the Fed's saying that the upside risks to inflation 
have risen has taken the market a bit off guard. This should be 
longer-term bullish for the dollar. Whether it can hold gains 
today remains to be seen. There are obviously some buyers 
coming into the market now, with people looking to grab the 
euro at cheaper levels there. But beyond that move, it should 
be dollar supportive."  
ROBERT DYE, SENIOR ECONOMIST, PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, 
PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA: "The Fed presented a more balanced assessment of risks and 
there's no change in policy for the time being. They obviously 
had to signal that they would continue to keep a watchful eye 
on inflation, but we expect them to continue to hold rates 
steady over the summer months and through the end of this year, 
contrary to the prediction of the fed funds futures market."  
WILLIAM LARKIN, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, CABOT MONEY MANAGEMENT, 
SALEM, MASSACHUSETTS: "The bond market is selling off, but I thought the 
statement was pretty positive for bonds because they said that 
they thought growth and inflation were going to moderate." "But most people see inflation (will) be a chronic problem 
as long as energy prices stay high."  
STEPHEN SCHORK, EDITOR OF THE SCHORK REPORT, ENERGY NEWSLETTER, 
PHILADELPHIA: "If we begin to see further dollar strength take some of 
the wind out of the bulls' sails, it will have a negative 
impact on oil prices." 
TOM KNIGHT, ENERGY PRODUCTS TRADER, TRUMAN ARNOLD, TEXARKANA, 
TEXAS: "I don't expect the Fed decision to keep rates unchanged to 
do much for energy futures. Crude futures are still trading in 
range. We've fallen below $132 and drifting back higher... we 
will likely end at the middle of the range."  
JOE MANIMBO, CURRENCY TRADER, RUESCH INTERNATIONAL, 
WASHINGTON: "The Fed made a moderately hawkish statement, signaling 
that the Fed may actually go ahead and raise interest rates 
later this year. That would obviously help the dollar."  
MARKET REACTION:  * BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices extended losses  * CURRENCIES: U.S. dollar gains, and then reverses the initial 
move as the euro bounces back above $1.56  * STOCKS: U.S. equity indexes add to gains  * RATE FUTURES: Fed fund futures choppy on FOMC decision, split 
on prospects for August fed move
