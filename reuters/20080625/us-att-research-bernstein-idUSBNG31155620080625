 (Reuters) - Sanford C. Bernstein boosted its rating on AT&T Inc ( T.N ) to "outperform" from "market-perform," noting the recent weakness in the top U.S. phone company's shares provided an attractive entry point, sending its stock up 2.5 percent. 

 But the brokerage cut its price target on the stock by $2 to $42 to reflect the broader pullback in the equity markets. Bernstein said sentiment in the telecom sector has turned bleak over fears of slowing wireless subscriber growth, risks of a price war, and worsening wireline access line and margin trends, causing valuations to fall. The sentiment was exacerbated after the company said its earnings would be hurt due to the subsidizing of Apple Inc's ( AAPL.O ), the brokerage said. However, there is a case for a bullish interpretation of the subsidy as it can deliver higher volumes, significant longer term value, and a longer and smoother earnings growth trajectory beyond 2009, it added. Shares over the past month have trailed the S&P 500  .SPX , Bernstein said. AT&T shares are down 11.9 percent since the start of the month, compared with a 5.5 percent drop in the S&P 500  .SPX . AT&T shares were trading up at $35.16 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by S John Tilak in Bangalore; Editing by Jarshad Kakkrakandy)
