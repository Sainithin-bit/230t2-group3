 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - As it prepares to become a public company on Nasdaq, Ticketmaster is betting big on providing an exchange where consumers can trade their own tickets to concerts and sports events. 

 Once primarily a box office service, Ticketmaster draws about 70 percent of revenue from Web sales and sees vast potential in the emerging market for customers who bought tickets and want to unload them in a protected environment. "Casual fans themselves haven't necessarily had the ability in any easy way to resell tickets, and that's all changing," Ticketmaster Chief Executive Sean Moriarty told Reuters. "Tickets are becoming much more like options: They're always available for a price," he said in an interview. "Every buyer is becoming a potential seller." The ticket resale market is expected to grow about 12 percent on average through 2012, when it will approach $4.5 billion, according to data cited by Ticketmaster. While it now accounts for an estimated 10 percent to 20 percent of ticket sales, Moriarty sees it as becoming nearly inseparable from the overall business over time. Secondary ticket sales have grown into a recognized business from what was once a gray market controlled by scalpers outside of sports and music venues. Now some of the Web's biggest companies, like eBay Inc ( EBAY.O ), offer the service to reap premiums on events that are in high demand. Earlier this year, Ticketmaster bought Web reseller TicketsNow, and also offers selling options on its main site. It is one area of growth eyed by the company, which is due to spin off from parent IAC/InterActiveCorp ( IACI.O ) by early August. Company executives said on Monday that Ticketmaster would take on $750 million in debt before its spin-off, with most of the proceeds to be paid as a dividend to IAC. In 2009, Ticketmaster expects profit growth, coupled with significant cost-cutting steps. The company faces competition from its long-time client, concert promoter Live Nation ( LYV.N ), which is ending their partnership to enter the primary ticket sales market next year and is looking closely at the resale market as well. In a sign of the risks tied to a changing industry for both live and recorded music, Live Nation's chairman resigned last week in a dispute over how aggressively the company should pursue costly deals with major name artists. STRONG OLYMPICS SALES Ticketmaster will hold onto investments in Front Line Management, which represents top-name artists, and iLike, a meteorically rising social network application that lets Web users compare and share music. Moriarty sees Ticketmaster making more forays into areas once dominated by record labels, helping artists market their music directly to fans and helping listeners navigate through a wealth of acts to discover new favorites. He has also set his sights on international expansion, and expects the company to as much as double its international presence to 40 countries in the next five years. The push reflects the emergence of live entertainment in new markets and could help offset any weakness from a deteriorating economy in the United States and Europe. For example, Ticketmaster has partnered with a local agent to be the exclusive ticket sales service for the Beijing Olympics this year. The Gehua Ticketmaster venture has sold 6 million out of 7 million total tickets it was allocated for the Games, with the remaining tickets becoming available next month. That is up from 6.7 million tickets sold for the Sydney Olympics in 2000 and 3.5 million for Athens in 2004. "The world is simultaneously getting smaller and wealthier and there's more entertainment for people on the planet," Moriarty said. At the same time, Ticketmaster has yet to see the impact of U.S. recessionary pressures on ticket buying. If it did, a resale option could also help keep consumers buying tickets, knowing they won't lose the value of the purchase. "That's not to say that they won't" be impacted by a weak economy, he said. "In general, live entertainment is a relatively low frequency purchase category. We don't know people are necessarily going to cut their annual baseball game or a summer amphitheater show in the event that times are a bit tougher."
