 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The governor of Washington state plans to hold a news conference on Wednesday to "address allegations of repeated discriminatory lending practices" by Countrywide Financial Corp CFC.N, the governor's office said in a press advisory. 

 The alleged activity targeted the state's minority community, Gov. Christine Gregoire's office said. It said the governor would be joined in Seattle by the state's Department of Financial Institutions, which led the investigation, the Urban League of Metropolitan Seattle, and a victim of predatory lending.
