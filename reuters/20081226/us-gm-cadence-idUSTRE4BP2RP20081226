 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) has filed a lawsuit against a bankrupt auto-parts supplier, saying it is holding necessary equipment "hostage" which could potentially interrupt the launch of its new Chevrolet Camaro car. 

 In a lawsuit filed on Wednesday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware, General Motors asked the court to allow it access to facilities of the supplier, Cadence Innovation, so it could obtain necessary tooling and parts for its plants. Cadence, which makes door trim, instrument panels and air bag covers, filed for bankruptcy protection in August, but this month abandoned plans to sell itself and is now liquidating, according to court papers. GM said it needed immediate access to the tooling, because it does not have enough parts on hand, and its vehicle assembly operations could be interrupted. "Even one day's disruption in supply of certain Component Parts could cause a shutdown of GM assembly operations, disrupting not only GM's business, but the operations of countless suppliers, dealers, customers, and other stakeholders," GM said in the complaint. GM said that such a shut down could cost millions of dollars per plant per day and it would need to have a successor supplier in place by January 12 for the launch of the new Chevrolet Camaro. GM said it had an accommodation agreement with Cadence that requires the auto-parts supplier to continue to manufacture the parts and provide tooling and equipment. A Cadence lawyer and spokesman were not immediately available. (Reporting by  Emily Chasan  and Santosh Nadgir in Bangalore; Editing by  Tim Dobbyn )
