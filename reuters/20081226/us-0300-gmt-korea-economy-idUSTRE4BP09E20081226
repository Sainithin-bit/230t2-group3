 SEOUL  (Reuters) - South Korea's economy is in an unprecedented crisis with domestic and overseas demand falling at the same time, but the government will strive to avert an annual decline in exports in 2009, the economy ministry said on Friday. 

 The Ministry of Knowledge Economy said in its new year policy report to President Lee Myung-bak that it would aim to boost 2009 exports to $450 billion from around $430 billion projected for this year and earn a trade surplus of more than $10 billion. "The Korean economy is faced with an unprecedented crisis with exports and domestic demand, the two pillars of economic growth, falling at the same time," the ministry said. It also said the government would aim to boost foreign direct investment into the country by some 6 percent to $12.5 billion in 2009 from $11.8 billion seen for this year. The ministry, which is also in charge of energy policy, said state-run Korea National Oil Corp (KNOC) would aim to acquire a medium-sized overseas oil company or companies in 2009 to secure more sources of energy supply. South Korea does not produce oil on its territory to feed Asia's fourth-largest economy. (Reporting by  Yoo Choonsik ; Editing by  Jonathan Hopfner )
