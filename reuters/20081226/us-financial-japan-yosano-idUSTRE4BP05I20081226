 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japanese Economics Minister Kaoru Yosano said on Friday that the severe conditions surrounding the nation's economy would continue next year. 

 "Particularly striking is the pace of fall in industrial output," Yosano told a news conference after a cabinet meeting. "Japan's economy is in an abnormal situation, experiencing a recession and financial crisis at the same time." (Reporting by  Leika Kihara )
