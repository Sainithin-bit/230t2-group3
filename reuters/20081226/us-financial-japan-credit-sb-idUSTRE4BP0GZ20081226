 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan will provide credit support to Japanese firms operating in developed countries to help them cope with the global financial crisis, Finance Minister Shoichi Nakagawa said on Friday. 

 The plan will be implemented by the end of this year, with the government asking the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) to provide loans to Japanese firms and branches operating in the developed world. JBIC, the international wing of the state-owned Japan Finance Corp, has already announced it will provide loans, available through the end of March 2010, to exporters dealing in emerging economies and big firms operating in developing countries. "We decided to take these unprecedented and emergency steps to cope with the current financial and economic situation," Nakagawa told a news conference after a cabinet meeting. The steps follow those taken by major economies around the world to dish out trillions of dollars in bailouts and fiscal stimulus packages and drive borrowing costs ever closer to zero.
