 MONTREAL  (Reuters) - Alcan Inc. AL.TO( AL.N ) shares rose 6 percent on Wednesday on speculation a counter offer could emerge to Alcoa Inc.'s ( AA.N ) $28.4 billion hostile bid for the big Canadian aluminum maker. 

 Alcan rejected the offer on Tuesday that would create the world's largest producer of the metal, which is used in products ranging from beverage cans to airplanes, and said it was in talks with third parties. "A lengthy delay of this deal would grant another company sufficient time to review its options and launch a counter- bid," John Redstone, analyst at Desjardins Securities, said in a research report. He said there was a 50 percent chance of a counter-bid for Alcan, especially as Alcoa's May 7 offer would likely take several months to gain approval from anti-trust authorities. Shares in Alcan gained 6 percent to $85.89 on the New York Stock Exchange -- 14 percent higher than Alcoa's cash-and-stock offer of $75.18 a share. In Toronto, Alcan rose C$4.28 to a new high of C$92.50. Alcoa Chief Executive Alain Belda said the company was prepared to move forward as quickly as possible to address the remaining conditions to the offer. "We have an aggressive, well-developed plan that recognizes and eliminates potential competitive overlaps and we are confident that we can effectively resolve any regulatory issues," he said in a statement after the markets closed on Wednesday. Alcoa shares rose $1.42, or 3.6 percent, to close at $40.37 in New York. Alcoa expects to extend its offer for Alcan, which expires on July 10, from time to time to accommodate the longer period needed to fulfill the offer's conditions. Alcoa was offering $58.60 a share plus 0.4108 of its shares, for Alcan. Alcoa said it has begun discussions on its proposal with anti-trust authorities in the United States, Canada and Europe. OTHER POTENTIAL SUITORS "Maybe Alcoa thinks there is no one else serious on the horizon so they try a first round and then come back with another offer," said Commonwealth Securities of Australia analyst Martin Petch. The Globe and Mail newspaper said on Wednesday that Alcan was in talks with BHP Billiton Plc ( BLT.L )( BHP.AX ) as part of its plan to consider alternatives to the Alcoa bid. Some analysts were unsure that Alcan would fit well with BHP, which has turned away from downstream metals fabrication since its merger with Billiton in 2001. "I don't think they (BHP) want the rolling stock and those type of things, such as mills," said ABN AMRO mining analyst Warren Edney in Melbourne, where BHP is headquartered. "They are not into that sort of stuff." Meanwhile, Rio Tinto Ltd./Plc. ( RIO.AX ) ( RIO.L ) is seen more likely to employ its scrip in any big takeover attempt to avert a potential liquidity crunch. Thanks to a boom in demand for nickel, iron ore, copper and other mineral commodities, BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto export en masse to fast-industrializing but resource-starved China. However, aluminum is one of the few minerals commodities China does not need to import. A spokeswoman for BHP, whose Australia-listed shares fell 0.9 percent to A$31.10 in a broader market down 1.2 percent, declined to comment. Alcan officials would not respond to questions about market speculation. Sources familiar with the matter said Alcan was likely to encourage counter offers, but it was too early to pick a favorite in any auction for the Montreal-based company. Other potential counter bidders are Xstrata Plc XTA.L and Anglo American Plc ( AAL.L ), banking sources added. Alcan profits have been rising over the past few years along with aluminum prices and it has a line of bauxite, alumina and aluminum production expansion projects underway that analysts expect will add to earnings. Yet some analysts think the company ought to consider diversifying into other metals. (Additional reporting by  Mathieu Robbins )
