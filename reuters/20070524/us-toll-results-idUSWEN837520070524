 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Luxury home builder Toll Brothers ( TOL.N ) said quarterly profit fell 79 percent, hurt by the U.S. housing slump, but its shares rose on Thursday along with its sector after government data showed a better-than-expected rise in new home sales. 

 Toll shares rose 2.2 percent in early trading, after a Commerce Department report showed that new home sales rose 16.2 percent in April, the sharpest gain in 14 years.  Net income fell to $36.7 million, or 22 cents a share, in the second quarter ended April 30 from $174.9 million, or $1.06 a share, a year earlier. The results beat analysts' average expectation of 14 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. "The results were bad, everyone knew they were going to be bad," said Eric Landry, equity analyst at Morningstar, in Chicago. Excluding after-tax write-downs of $72.9 million, Toll said it earned 66 cents per share. For about a year, home construction has fallen off sharply on weakening demand and rising interest rates. This followed a long run-up in property values in many parts of the United States, as Americans took advantage of low interest rates and unconventional financing schemes like interest-only mortgages to purchase larger and more luxurious homes. Toll's results showed that the slower buying at the lower end of the market, hurt by the troubles in the subprime lending market, which focuses on writing mortgages to less-creditworthy borrowers, were hurting the high end of housing as well. That's largely because the higher-end buyers such as Toll caters to often need to sell a first home before upgrading. "This is not a low-end type of phenomenon," Landry said of the slowdown. "The entire housing chain has been affected." Second-quarter revenue fell 19 percent to $1.17 billion. Net contracts were down 25 percent to $1.17 billion. Net of cancellations, contracts totaled 1,647 units, down 24 percent. The second-quarter cancellation rate was 18.9 percent, down from the prior quarter's rate of 29.8 percent, but still higher than the company's historical average of about 7 percent. "Given the uncertainty surrounding sales paces, and market direction and, thus, the potential for and size of future impairments, we are not comfortable giving full earnings guidance," Chief Financial Officer Joel Rassman said in a statement. The company said it expected home building revenue of $4.26 billion to $4.88 billion for 2007 and $990 million to $1.28 billion in the third quarter. Analysts, on average, had expected full-year revenue of $4.43 billion and third-quarter revenue of $1.09 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. HOLDING BACK The company noted that there remain some "glimmers of strength" in a soft real-estate market, citing the New York City metropolitan area, as well as areas around Philadelphia; the state of Delaware; Raleigh, North Carolina; the Texas cities of Austin and Dallas, and Northern California. "We continue to seek a balance between our short-term goal of selling homes in a tough market and maximizing the value of our communities," said Robert Toll, chairman and chief executive, in a statement. "Many of these communities have substantial embedded value, realizable in the future, that should not be sacrificed in the current soft market." Toll Brothers shares rose 65 cents to $30.42 in early New York Stock Exchange trading. Elsewhere in the sector, shares of D.R. Horton Inc. ( DHI.N ), the largest U.S. home builder, were up 30 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $23.93, while shares of No. 2 Pulte Homes Inc. ( PHM.N ) rose 99 cents, or 3.6 percent, to  $28.17. Toll shares have declined 5.7 percent so far this year, a less-steep drop than the 8.4 percent slide in the Dow Jones U.S. home builders index .DJUSHB, and trade at about 19.8 times the company's forecast 2007 earnings, a discount to the forward price-to-earnings ratio of 22.2 for that index.
