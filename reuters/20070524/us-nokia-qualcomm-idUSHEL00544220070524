 HELSINKI  (Reuters) - Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ), the world's top mobile phone maker, said on Thursday it has filed its first patent counter-suit against Qualcomm ( QCOM.O ), seeking damages and an injunction against the U.S. company's chipsets. 

 Nokia said it also responded to the lawsuit filed by Qualcomm in Wisconsin on 2 April 2007. Nokia says it remains confident that its products do not infringe either of the two Qualcomm patents-in-suit and said that both patents are invalid. Over the past 19 months, Qualcomm has filed 11 patent suits against Nokia seeking damages and injunctions, Nokia said. Nokia said it has filed in a Wisconsin court patent counter suits against Qualcomm for its infringement of six Nokia implementation patents used in Qualcomm GSM/WCDMA and CDMA2000 chipsets. "First and foremost, this is a counteraction. Since they are seeking injunction against us, we are doing this reciprocally," Rick Simonson, Nokia Chief Financial Officer told Reuters in an interview. "We believe very strongly Qualcomm has copied our implementation patents," he said. An important cross-licensing agreement over technology patents between U.S. chip firm Qualcomm and Nokia expired partly last month, and their ongoing battle is worrying investors and the industry on both sides of the Atlantic. The legal dispute between the two centers on Nokia's use of Qualcomm patents for 3G, a high-speed wireless technology, but it also has a bearing on Qualcomm's chips business, which according to Nokia uses many Nokia-patented technologies.
