 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Drugmaker Mylan Laboratories Inc. MYL.N posted a quarterly loss on Thursday on charges related to an acquisition, and reported an adjusted profit that was held back after it deferred contribution from a generic version of a blood-pressure drug. 

 Mylan, due to accounting issues, did not record any contribution from a generic version of the blockbuster blood-pressure drug Norvasc that it launched in the quarter. Not including the generic Norvasc contribution "will be viewed as a disappointment," Cowen & Co. analyst Ken Cacciatore said in a research note. Mylan's shares slipped nearly 3 percent early, despite the fact that the company's results beat its prior forecast. Net loss was $71.3 million, or 31 cents per share, for its fiscal fourth quarter that ended March 31. The quarter included purchase-accounting adjustments related to its acquisition of India-based Matrix Laboratories Ltd. MAXL.BO, including a write-off of $147 million. The net loss compared with net earnings of $57.7 million, or 27 cents per share, a year earlier. Mylan posted adjusted profit, excluding the Matrix charge, of 47 cents per share for the quarter, and $1.65 per share for the fiscal year, after saying last month it would report adjusted earnings per share of $1.60 to $1.63 for the fiscal year. Analysts, on average, expected 55 cents per share for the quarter, according to Reuters Estimates. However, Mylan said, most analysts included in their estimates contributions for Mylan's generic form of Pfizer Inc.'s ( PFE.N ) Norvasc. Mylan launched the drug, known generically as amlodipine, on March 23, but said it deferred revenue recognition of the product because of accounting rules. Mylan would have recognized up to $90 million of net revenue related to amlodipine for the fourth quarter. Mylan currently sells the only generic version of amlodipine, but said that other competition could arrive leading to uncertainty about its pricing on the product. "We view this exclusion of generic Norvasc as the height of conservatism since establishment of a reserve could have been able to provide some level of comfort to the auditors in case of competitive launches," Cacciatore said in a research note. Quarterly revenue jumped 53 percent to $483.7 million, helped by generic versions of two Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ.N ) products -- the Duragesic pain patch and Ditropan XL overactive-bladder treatment. Mylan announced earlier this month that it would buy Germany-based Merck KGaA's ( MRCG.DE ) generics unit for $6.7 billion in a deal it said would make it the world's third-largest generic drugmaker. Mylan's shares fell 55 cents, or 2.7 percent, to $19.69 in early NYSE trading. (Additional reporting by Varsha Tickoo in Bangalore)
