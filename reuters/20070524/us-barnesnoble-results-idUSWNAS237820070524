 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Barnes & Noble Inc. ( BKS.N ), the world's largest book retailer, on Thursday posted a first-quarter loss, citing charges stemming from the closure of its Internet distribution center and an investigation of its stock option granting practices. 

 The retailer said the net loss totaled $1.7 million, or 3 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier profit of about $10 million, or 14 cents a share.
