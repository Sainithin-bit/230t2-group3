 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Clothing retailer Gap ( GPS.N ) reported on Thursday a 26 percent drop in quarterly profit as it cut prices at its struggling Gap stores and began closing its Forth & Towne business. 

 Gap, which also owns the Old Navy and Banana Republic chains, also reiterated its profit forecast for the year, indicating it still does not expect a quick financial fix, and said its search for a new chief executive could take time. On a conference call with analysts, interim CEO Robert Fisher said Gap's flagship chain would begin targeting late-20s shoppers to distinguish itself from teen-oriented retailers Abercrombie & Fitch Co. ( ANF.N ) and American Eagle Outfitters Inc. ( AEO.N ) The company, which operates more than 3,000 stores worldwide, is trying to revive sales and regain its former position as the icon of American casual fashion. Gap did not buy back stock last quarter and executives said it would not resume buybacks until the business stabilized. First-quarter net income fell to $178 million, or 22 cents per share, from $242 million, or 28 cents per share. As reported earlier this month, sales rose 3.5 percent to $3.56 billion. Excluding losses at Forth & Towne, which targets women over 35, Gap earned 25 cents a share. On that basis, analysts had expected, on average, earnings of 24 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Gap itself had forecast earnings per share to range between 23 cents and 25 cents, excluding Forth & Towne costs. TARGETING LATE-20-SOMETHINGS "The focus on the late 20s customer is going to allow us much more focused product assortment, much stronger marketing messages," Fisher said, adding that it would sharpen its focus by cutting the number of fall products it sells by 30 percent. Retail analyst Jennifer Black of Jennifer Black & Associates said that move should help Gap "stand for something, versus just being a sea of mediocrity." Gap, based in San Francisco, has been looking for a new CEO since January. "This type of search can take time and it remains a top priority for the board," Fisher said. Meanwhile, the company has made a slew of management changes, most recently the appointment of Patrick Robinson on Wednesday as design chief for Gap Adult and gapbody. Robinson had been artistic director of Paco Rabanne since 2005 and previously worked for Perry Ellis and Anne Klein. Gap has said uninspiring fashions are behind its reporting of flat or falling same-store sales in every month but three since June 2004. Same-store sales, which track sales at stores open at least a year, fell 4 percent in the first quarter compared to a 9 percent decline a year earlier. Chief Financial Officer Byron Pollitt said the company's Gap stores increased markdowns during the quarter to cut excess inventories. That drove gross margins, a measure of profitability, down 2.1 points from the previous year. "We expect Gap brand inventories to be back in line by fall," Pollitt said. Fisher has called 2007 a transition year and has promised no quick fixes for turning around the company. Gap said in a statement it still expects to earn between 76 cents and 86 cents per share this year. Excluding Forth & Towne losses, earnings are expected to be 80 cents to 90 cents a share. Excluding items, analysts are expecting earnings of 93 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Gap shares were trading at $18.50 in extended trading, up 1.1 percent from their New York Stock Exchange close. The stock trades at 18 times analysts' average estimate for next year's earnings, compared with an average multiple of 14 for companies in the Standard & Poor's specialty retail index .GSPSPR.
