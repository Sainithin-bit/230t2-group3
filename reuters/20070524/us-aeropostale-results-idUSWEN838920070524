 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Teen retailer Aeropostale Inc. ( ARO.N ) reported a 62 percent rise in first-quarter profit on Thursday, helped by improved sales and a higher gross margin. 

 The company forecast second-quarter profit above the current Wall Street view, and its shares rose in extended trading. Net income was $13.8 million, or 26 cents per share, for the quarter ended May 5, compared with $8.4 million, or 15 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts expected 25 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Total sales rose 12 percent to $275.8 million, while sales at stores open at least a year increased 2.5 percent. In a statement, the mall-based retailer said results were aided by better inventory management and demand for its fashions. Gross profit as a percent of sales was 32.2 percent, better than the year-earlier 28.6 percent. Unlike many competitors who lowered their first-quarter earnings outlooks due to difficult April sales, Aeropostale raised its quarterly view earlier this month, citing a positive trend in gross profit margins during April. That was despite a 14 percent decrease in April same-store sales, a key measure of retail performance that measures sales at established stores. Aeropostale said it expects a profit of 26 cents to 28 cents a share for the second quarter, above the current Wall Street consensus estimate of 20 cents a share. The retailer said its forecast reflects an expected shift in profits of 4 cents to 6 cents per share into the second quarter from the third quarter, based on a calendar change that accelerates the back-to-school selling season. Aeropostale shares rose 1.3 percent to $46.99 in extended trading from their $46.38 close on the New York Stock Exchange after the results were posted.
