 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Brown Shoe Co. Inc. ( BWS.N ) said on Thursday quarterly profit fell, hurt by a charge and lower-than-expected sales in its wholesale division. 

 The company, which operates the Famous Footwear and Naturalizer chains, said first-quarter net income fell to $9.6 million, or 22 cents a share, from $10.0 million, or 23 cents a share, a year ago. Excluding one-time charges, the company earned 29 cents a share. The results included a charge of 7 cents a share stemming from the company's earnings enhancement plan. Analysts, on average, were expecting the St. Louis-based Brown Shoe to earn 18 cents a share for the quarter, excluding items, on some $575.6 million in sales, according to Reuters Estimates. Brown Shoe said quarterly sales slipped 1.6 percent to $566.3 million from $575.5 million and sales at its wholesale division tumbled 16.6 percent. "Our wholesale division sales were slightly lower than we expected," Chief Executive Ron Fromm said in a statement. "Nonetheless, operating margins in the quarter at wholesale were strong, generating a 190 basis-point improvement over last year." At its Famous Footwear chain, sales at stores open at least a year, a key retail measure known as same-store sales, climbed 3.4 percent from a year ago, the company said. Same-store sales at Brown Shoe's specialty retail segment, which also includes Naturalizer and Shoes.com, rose 3.4 percent. Brown Shoe said it expects 2007 sales to range between $2.48 billion and $2.52 billion, with earnings between $1.52 and $1.55 a share. The full-year earnings forecast includes a charge of 31 cents a share from Brown Shoe's earnings enhancement plan. The company said it expects to earn 22 cents to 24 cents a share during the second quarter on sales between $582 million and $592 million. For the second quarter, analysts on average, expect Brown Shoe to earn 23 cents a share on about $598 million in sales. Analysts also see full-year earnings of $1.54 a share on about $2.5 billion in sales. The company also named Sheri Wilson-Gray as its new chief marketing officer.
