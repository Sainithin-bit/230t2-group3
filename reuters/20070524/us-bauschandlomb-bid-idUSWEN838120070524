 PHILADELPHIA  (Reuters) - Advanced Medical Optics Inc. EYE.N on Thursday confirmed it was interested in exploring a potential acquisition of Bausch & Lomb Inc. BOL.N and offering a superior price than the eye-care company's deal to be bought by a private equity firm for $3.67 billion. 

 "We believe that the current transaction with Warburg Pincus undervalues Bausch & Lomb, and we plan to enter the go-shop process with the intention of exploring a superior offer for the company," Advanced Medical said in a statement. Bausch & Lomb agreed last week to be acquired by Warburg Pincus for about $3.67 billion. Bausch & Lomb, however, had the right to solicit other offers during the next 50 days.
