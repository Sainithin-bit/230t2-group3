 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bakery company Flowers Foods Inc. ( FLO.N ), whose brands include Nature's Own, posted better-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday, helped by price increases and stronger sales of higher-priced items, sending its shares up more than 3 percent. 

 Net income rose to $28.5 million, or 46 cents per share, from $22.9 million, or 37 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting earnings of 42 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose to $609.9 million from $563.6 million a year ago, helped by higher pricing, more sales of higher-priced items and higher sales volume. The company affirmed its 2007 outlook for earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.33 to $1.43 and sales of $1.98 billion to $2.04 billion. Analysts on average were expecting earnings of $1.39 per share on sales of $2.03 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. "Given the better than expected profit margin trends... It seems Flowers should post full-year earnings per share near the high end of its guidance range," wrote JP Morgan Securities analyst Pablo Zuanic in a note to clients. Shares of Flowers Foods were up 3.4 percent at $33.53 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. (Additional reporting by  Anupreeta Das )
