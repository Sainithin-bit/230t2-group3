 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Citigroup's ( C.N ) involvement in most transactions announced on the latest "Merger Monday" helped it edge ahead of rivals in the M&A advisory league tables for announced global deals. 

 But with transactions taking place at record pace this year, the lead in the M&A league tables could change hands frequently before the final bragging rights are won. Nonetheless, Citi said its global reach helped it muscle in on the majority of the roughly $100 billion of deals announced at the beginning of this week. Year-to-date, the value of global M&A is approaching $2.5 trillion. Some of the biggest recent mergers have been cross-border, a discipline where Citigroup believes it has an advantage. For example, Citi advised Riyadh-based chemicals company Saudi Basic Industries Corp. 2010.SE (SABIC) which on Monday bought General Electric Co's ( GE.N ) GE Plastics business in an $11.6 billion cash deal. "The ability to provide strategic advice to SABIC in its acquisition of GE Plastics is as cross-border as you get," said Raymond J. McGuire, co-head of global investment banking for Citigroup, in an interview. "What are the forces at play today? It is global in nature," said McGuire. "Monday reflected strategic activity from the emerging markets to the developed markets." Regardless of geography, liberal credit markets and lower interest rates are still main drivers of M&A. "Underlying this is a global financing market that is also at historically attractive rates -- you have an interest rate environment that is helping to give courage," said McGuire. TIGHT RACE With a record level of mergers, investment bankers make sure they get league table credit for their deals. Even at this early stage of the year, banks are in continuous contact with compilers of M&A advisory league tables like Thomson Financial and Dealogic. The race for the top league table places is as intense as ever. "It's close -- people are getting credit for the same deals because you have multiple advisers," said Richard Peterson, director of capital markets at Thomson Financial. For deal value year-to-date, Citigroup this week edged slightly ahead of second-place Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ), with both firms involved in more than $700 billion of transactions, according to both Dealogic and Thomson. "On a volume basis, it's typically fairly tight," said Jody Drulard, managing director at Dealogic. But while this deal value number grabs the headlines, helps marketing, and ensures bragging rights, Drulard said that internally, investment banks are more interested in actual revenue earned from M&A. And on a revenue basis, Goldman is still ahead of all rivals year to date, according to Dealogic and Thomson. "When you flip it over to a revenue basis, Goldman Sachs tends to be way out in front," said Drulard. "Internally, they all look at revenue. Externally, from an advertising perspective, they look at the volume totals." Asked for Goldman Sachs' view on the league table race, a company spokesman said: "We manage our business to provide value for clients, not for the league tables."
