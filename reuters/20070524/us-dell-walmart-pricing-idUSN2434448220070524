 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) said on Thursday it will charge less than $700 for two multimedia desktop personal computer bundles from PC maker Dell Inc. DELL.O that it plans to start selling next month. 

 Wal-Mart disclosed the pricing in a statement sent via e-mail to Reuters. Officials with Wal-Mart and Dell declined to identify the equipment that will be included in the two Dimension desktop PC bundles that it will be offering at some 3,500 Wal-Mart and Sam's Club stores in the United States and Canada. A spokesman for Dell said that his company will sell the same products on its own Web site.
