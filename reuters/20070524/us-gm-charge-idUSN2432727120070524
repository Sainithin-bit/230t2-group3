 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp.( GM.N ) could take a $1 billion charge in the second quarter in relation to its financial exposure to Delphi Corp DPHIQ.PK, GM spokeswoman Renee Rashid-Merem said on Thursday. 

 The No.1 U.S. automaker in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing that its exposure to bankrupt auto parts maker Delphi Corp. DPHIQ.PK was probably $7 billion. "We have taken a $6 billion charge to date," Rashid-Merem said. "In order to hit that $7 billion, we would potentially take an additional $1 billion charge in the second quarter." "That's primarily non-cash," she added.
