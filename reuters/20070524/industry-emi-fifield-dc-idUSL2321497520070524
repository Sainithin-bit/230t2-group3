 LONDON  (Reuters) - Former EMI Group Chief Executive Jim 
Fifield is still working on a deal to buy the company despite 
his reported financial backer, Corvus Capital, pulling out, the 
New York Post said on its Web site. 

  The private equity group said on Wednesday it had 
considered making a bid for EMI but had decided against it. The 
newspaper said on Thursday Fifield had received financial 
commitments from members of the Qatari royal family.  It said Fifield wanted to run EMI's recorded music division 
and sell its publishing assets to record executive Charles 
Koppelman and private equity firm GTCR Golder Rauner.  EMI's board recommended a 265 pence a share offer from 
private equity firm Terra Firma on Monday.
