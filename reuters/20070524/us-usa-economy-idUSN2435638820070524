 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Sales of new homes rose 16.2 percent in April, the sharpest climb in 14 years as builders slashed prices a record 11 percent, a government report showed on Thursday, signaling stabilization in the housing sector. 

 Other reports also reflected economic strength, indicating the Federal Reserve would likely hold interest rates steady for the foreseeable future. The Commerce Department said sales of new single-family homes in April rose to an annual rate of 981,000 units from a revised pace of 844,000 in March. Analysts had expected sales would increase to only an 860,000 unit rate. The stronger-than-expected showing came as builders slashed prices, pushing the median price of a new home to $229,100 in April from $257,600 in March. "When you slash prices and pile on the incentives, you move product," said Mike Larson, a real estate analyst at investment firm Weiss Research in Jupiter, Florida. "That was the lesson the auto industry taught us post-9/11, and that's the lesson in today's new home sales report." Another report showed April orders for durable goods rose a weaker-than-expected 0.6 percent, but key gauges of business investment and inventories signaled strength. U.S. Government bond prices fell and the dollar rose against the euro as the data led financial markets to scale back expectations of a Fed interest rate cut. Major U.S. stock indices initially rose on the home sales data but then turned negative as traders took profits ahead of the holiday weekend. HOME INVENTORIES LEANER The number of new homes for sale fell to 538,000 in April from 546,000 in March. It would take 6.5 months to clear that inventory at the current sales pace, a sharp drop from the 8.1 months recorded a month earlier. Some analysts said the new homes data was a sign of stabilization in the housing market and would help dissipate a major cloud over the U.S. economy. "The housing market seems to be bottoming out. The worst is clearly behind us in terms of the decline in home sales and construction activity," said Mark Vitner, senior economists with Wachovia Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. At the same time, economists said the data on durable goods -- costly items meant to last three years or more -- indicated the health of the factory sector was improving, while businesses were showing a willingness to spend. The rise in orders followed a strong 5 percent March gain, while orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, seen by economists as a proxy for business investment, rose 1.2 percent in April after a 4.4 percent increase in March. CIVILIAN AIRCRAFT, AUTOMOTIVE ORDERS FALL The softer tone of overall durable goods orders in April was due largely to changes in the volatile transportation sector, where orders fell 1.3 percent after a 13.6 percent March rise. April civilian aircraft orders fell 10.7 percent after a 53.6 percent gain in March, while motor vehicle and parts orders dropped 1.9 percent after rising 2.7 percent. In a third report, the Labor Department said new claims for jobless benefits rose 15,000 to 311,000 last week. But a four-week moving average of claims, which irons out weekly variations to give a clearer picture of underlying labor-market trends, fell for a fourth successive week. The average hit 302,750, the lowest level since February 2006. (Additional reporting by  Glenn Somerville  and Patrick Rucker in Washington)
