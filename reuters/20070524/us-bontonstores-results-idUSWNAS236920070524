 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Retailer Bon-Ton Stores Inc. ( BONT.O ) reported a wider quarterly loss on Thursday as bad weather resulted in lower-than-expected sales in April. 

 The company, which doubled its size last year by acquiring department stores from Saks Inc. SKS.N and Belk, reported a first-quarter net loss of $29.3 million, or $1.78 a share, compared with a loss of $10.8 million, or 66 cents a share, a year earlier.
