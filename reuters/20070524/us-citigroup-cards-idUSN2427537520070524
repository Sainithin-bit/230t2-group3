 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Citigroup ( C.N ) is replacing thousands of Visa-branded American Airlines credit cards with new account numbers and cards that carry the American Express logo, the Wall Street Journal reported on its Web site on Thursday. 

 The change comes as Citigroup tries to strengthen its relationship with American Express Co. ( AXP.N ) that began in late 2005, the paper reported. Citigroup could not be reached immediately.
