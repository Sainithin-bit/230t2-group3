 PHILADELPHIA  (Reuters) - Private equity firms not only are causing the mergers and acquisitions market to expand, but they're also starting to speed up the auction process. 

 Experts say decisions by Alltel Corp. ( AT.N ) and EMI Group Plc EMI.L to accept early takeover offers from private equity firms before letting their sale auctions run their course marked a new trend of accelerating negotiations. Rural wireless telephone company Alltel grabbed a $25 billion takeover proposal at least two weeks before the formal deadline for first-round offers, leaving two other bidding groups in the cold. Music company EMI forged its $4.73 billion deal three days before potential suitors were expected to submit final offers. The move by the private equity bidders to lob high offers and lock deals in place before the bidding deadlines reflected a scrappy strategy to try to beat opponents, some merger experts said. "If you feel you have a preemptive bid and you are comfortable making it, you try to make it and preempt the auction process," said Morton Pierce, chairman of the mergers and acquisition group at law firm Dewey Ballantine LLP in New York. Global mergers and acquisitions have topped $2.3 trillion so far in 2007, up from $1.4 trillion a year earlier, according to Dealogic. Private equity firms and other buyout groups accounted 18 percent of merger volume globally and 34 percent in the United States, the research firm said. Because of the competitive merger market, bidders are trying new strategies to ensure success, experts said. "I think it is somewhat aided by the environment where -- it is trite to say, but true -- there is so much money chasing all these deals," Pierce said. Still, without fully exhausting the auction, companies may never know whether a richer offer may have emerged. "When there's an offer that's been made and an auction process that hasn't been completed, it's incumbent upon the board to explain why they accepted an early offer," said Allen Michel, professor of finance and economics at Boston University's School of Management. In the case of Alltel, the company on Sunday accepted a cash bid of $25 billion from TPG Capital and the buyout arm of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. ( GS.N ) First-round bids, however, were not due until June 6, sources familiar with the situation had previously told Reuters. Media reports said Alltel proposed an earlier bid deadline, and the two losing investor groups indicated they could not submit their rival offers in time. Alltel spokesman Andrew Moreau declined to comment on details of the auction, but said the bidding process had been fair to all parties involved. While Alltel may not have attracted other bids, its investors will never know what would have happened if the auction had run its course. Analysts doubt a rival offer will surface now, given the existing deal's high premium and $700 million breakup fee. Alltel's stock this week has failed to top the bid price of $71.50 per share, reflecting investors' doubts that a higher offer is looming, investment bankers said. GAME OF CHICKEN "The question of whether to take an early bid or go through a complete auction is really a game of chicken for both sides," said Peter Townshend, a partner specializing in the private equity and emerging companies practice group at San Diego law firm McDermott Will & Emery LLP. "If you go through the whole auction, bidders run the risk that others will outbid them," Townshend said. "Meanwhile, if the target completes the whole process and the other offers don't turn out as high as they or Wall Street had expected, the company runs the risk that the early, high bid could disappear." In some cases, companies could be using an early offer as a "stalking horse bid" that establishes the minimum price they would accept, Townshend said. Experts say EMI may have been wise to grab the offer from private equity firm Terra Firma while it waits to see if music industry rival Warner Music Group Corp. WMG.N emerges with a bid. EMI now has a solid deal to fall back on if Warner fails to launch an offer. Since the Terra Firma deal was announced on Monday, shares of EMI have surged, trading above the offer of 265 pence a share as investors awaited rival bids. Warner, the fourth-largest music company, is evaluating its options for EMI, two sources close to the talks previously told Reuters. EMI and Warner were not immediately available for comment. Although companies could expose themselves to potential shareholder lawsuits by failing to conduct a full, competitive auction, Michel said it would be very difficult for a court to determine damages. "The damages become speculative because no one knows what other bids might have emerged," Michel said, "but the premature closing of an auction process would no doubt lead large shareholders to raise questions and potentially begin a litigation process." Still, as Pierce said: "You could argue that shareholders -- rather than being hurt -- are locking in and getting their money hopefully sooner." (Additional reporting by  Caroline Humer  in New York)
