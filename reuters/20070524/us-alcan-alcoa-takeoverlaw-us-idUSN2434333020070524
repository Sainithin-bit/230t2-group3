 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - If Canadian aluminum company Alcan Inc. AL.TO, the subject of a hostile takeover bid from U.S. rival Alcoa ( AA.N ), defends itself by turning the tables with an offer for Alcoa, some tough Pennsylvania anti-takeover laws stand before it. 

 Pennsylvania is one of a handful of U.S. states with laws designed to protect companies, and the jobs, based there. But in the end, the likelihood of such an offer succeeding may come down to how much Alcan is willing to pay, rather than the law itself. Pennsylvania takeover laws allow a company to consider a wide-range of constituents such as employees and community, rather than just shareholders, when it reviews a buyout offer. That means a company can reject an offer for a broader range of reasons than in other states. Alcoa made a more-than-$28 billion bid for Alcan ( AL.N ) this month, but Alcan rejected the offer this week, saying it did not reflect the company's value. After the announcement, Alcan Chief Executive Dick Evans refused to rule out the possibility that among its takeover defenses was a possible run at Alcoa, leaving analysts to speculate about the possibility. Such a move is called a Pac-Man defense, named for the video game in which the Pac-Man, properly fed, turns around and eats the ghost that had been chasing after him. PENNSYLVANIA LAW FIGHTS RAIDERS Pennsylvania was one of several states that turned to tougher takeover laws after a wave of hostile deals in the 1980s. "Pennsylvania decided that it was not going to be victimized by corporate raiders, particularly by those coming from the other side of the Hudson, meaning Wall Street," said Anthony Sabino, a professor of law at St. John's University in Queens, New York. The laws put up a number of obstacles, including making it easy for a target company to use a poison pill defense, which typically involves increasing the number of shares outstanding to make a buyout more expensive for any would-be acquirer. The laws also limit a shareholder's ability to call a special meeting -- a tactic used when a company is running a proxy battle to gain control of the board. They also set minimum severance payments and protect labor contracts. In addition, the laws have an anti-greenmail provision aimed at stopping companies that signal an intention to take a large stake as a takeover step but then simply sell the shares at a profit, as well as other limits on the control a shareholder can exercise. That said, as with any hostile offer, the trick to getting a deal done often has to do more with how much the would-be acquirer is willing to spend than with the roadblocks. "It's not impossible to do a hostile in Pennsylvania. There are a number of states that have relatively restrictive takeover laws, but what often happens is that the price being offered becomes high enough that shareholders are coaxed into accepting the bid," said Allen Michel, professor of finance and economics at Boston University's School of Management. "Hostile offers often become friendly deals in the end due to the high premiums offered," he said. "The Pennsylvania laws are a two-edged sword. They can chase away offers or serve as a catalyst for a committed bidder to offer a very large premium and, in the end, become successful." Alcoa shares were down 9 cents, or 0.2 percent, at $40.28 and Alcan was off $1.47, or 1.7 percent, at $84.42, both on the New York Stock Exchange.
