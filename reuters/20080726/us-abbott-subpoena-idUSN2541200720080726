 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Abbott Laboratories ( ABT.N ) said on Friday that it received a subpoena last month from the U.S. Department of Justice related to the sales and marketing of its bile-duct stents. 

 The subpoena was filed by the Justice Department to determine whether Abbott's activities violated civil or criminal laws, Abbott said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The government is seeking to determine whether the activities violated laws such as the Federal False Claims Act, the Food and Drug Cosmetic Act and the Anti-Kickback Statute in connection with Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement paid to third parties, Abbott said. Abbott is cooperating with the investigation, a company spokesman said, adding that domestic sales of the product in question are nominal. (Editing by Carol Bishopric)
