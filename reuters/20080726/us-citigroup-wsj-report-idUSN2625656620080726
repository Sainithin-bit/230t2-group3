 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - A former manager of a Citigroup Inc ( C.N ) hedge fund has filed a complaint with a British tribunal accusing the bank of causing his fund's demise, the Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday, citing people familiar with the matter. 

 In a sealed complaint filed last month with a state-run employment tribunal, John Pickett, who ran a hedge fund known as CSO Partners that specialized in corporate debt, accuses the bank of pressuring CSO to buy billions of dollars in troubled loans, the newspaper reported. Pickett said the loans undermined CSO and led to his resignation. Citigroup called the complaint "without merit," the Journal said.
