 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Google Inc ( GOOG.O ) is in early talks to join a group looking to lay a high-speed, trans- Pacific undersea cable that could potentially lead to the Internet company becoming an investor in the project, according to the Wall Street Journal. 

 The potential undersea fiber-optic investment could reflect Google's recent push to provide Internet-based services to businesses, since companies have lower tolerance for service interruptions and have offices around the world, the Journal reported on its Web site, citing a person familiar with the matter. The discussions remain fluid, the Journal reported. (Reporting by  Anupreeta Das )
