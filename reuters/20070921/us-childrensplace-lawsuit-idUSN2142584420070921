 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - An investor has sued Children's Place Retail Stores Inc ( PLCE.O ) and several of the company's executives, claiming executives hid information and misled investors. 

 The suit, which was filed in U.S. district court in Manhattan on Friday, is seeking class action status. In the lawsuit, investor Debra Hall claims the children's clothing retailer and its executives concealed material information about the company's profitability, an options investigations, the status of its license agreement with Walt Disney Co ( DIS.N ) and other factors that hurt its stock price. In the suit, the investor claims she and others "would not have purchased The Children's Place common stock at the prices they paid, or at all, if they had been aware that the market prices had been artificially and falsely inflated by Defendants' misleading statements." A Children's Place spokeswoman did not immediately return a message seeking comment. Children's Place shares are down nearly 60 percent year-to- date after the company, which runs the Disney Store chain and its namesake clothing chain, disclosed in August that its quarterly net loss nearly doubled and forecast full year earnings way below analyst estimates. Children's Place has yet to file its annual report for the year ended in February and several quarterly reports, prompted by a review of the company's historical stock options practices. Last month, Children's Place said its internal policies and procedures had been violated by two employees -- one who was a "named executive officer" and one who was not. It did not identify either.
