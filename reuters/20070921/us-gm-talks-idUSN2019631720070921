 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) and the United Auto Workers broke off negotiations in the early hours of Friday and agreed to return to the bargaining table later in the day, a GM spokesman said. 

 Talks adjourned around 12:45 a.m. ET on Friday, GM spokesman Tom Wickham said, as the two parties adjourned a bargaining session of more than 14 hours. The largest U.S. automaker and its major union have been locked in intensive labor negotiations since last Friday, when the UAW's past contract expired.
