 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Securities and Exchange Commission 
has issued a cease-and-desist order to pension consulting firm 
Callan Associates, citing incomplete disclosure of a conflict 
of interest, according to a document on the agency's Website. 

  Callan, which serves more than 270 funds with assets over 
$900 billion, has referred clients to BNY Brokerage Inc as 
Callan's preferred securities broker since 1999, the document 
said.  According to the September 19 document, Callan disclosed it 
had a contractual relationship with BNY that required Callan to 
identify BNY as its preferred or exclusive broker.  But, according to the document, Callan failed to disclose 
it was receiving annual payments that were contingent on Callan 
clients generating a certain level of commissions for BNY.  "The omission of this conflict caused Callan's public 
disclosures to be misleading," the document said.  The New York Times, which earlier reported the news on its 
Website, said Callan neither admitted nor denied the finding, 
but said it had amended its disclosure forms. Callan was not 
fined, the Times said.  A Callan spokeswoman told the Times the firm's eight-year 
agreement with the Bank of New York Mellon Corp ( BK.N ), of 
which BNY is a subsidiary, had expired on January 1 and the 
payments at the heart of the matter had ended.  Callan Associates was not immediately available for comment 
to Reuters.
