 ALBANY, New York  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve's lowering of interest rates has not spurred "moral hazard" in financial markets, Federal Reserve Board Governor Kevin Warsh said on Friday, arguing that markets have suffered real losses. 

 "I don't think our actions at this point have really spoken to moral hazard," Warsh said in answer to a question at the State University of New York at Albany's School of Business. "The tough valuations and the real losses that have been suffered across most of these asset markets, they are real," he said. "To the extent that some of these financial institutions are able to profit going forward is principally because they're putting new risk capital out there, they're putting new money at risk." Moral hazard refers to the idea that central bank rate cuts could bail out investors who made bad investment decisions, fostering the idea the Federal Reserve is providing a safety net for markets.
