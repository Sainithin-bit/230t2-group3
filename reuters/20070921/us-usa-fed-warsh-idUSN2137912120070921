 ALBANY, New York  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Board Governor Kevin Warsh said on Friday that the U.S. central bank will closely watch economic conditions to determine monetary policy going forward. 

 Warsh, speaking to the State University of New York at Albany's School of Business, also said the central bank would not necessarily act to bail out investors. "There are uncertainties that we are going to take into account. But rather than try to address our policy toward what is happening in a particular asset market, we're going to stay very focused on real time indicators and forward indicators" for growth and jobs, he said. "As we see those trends develop I think that will be far more important than anything else to impact out policies going forward." Warsh stressed that a smooth-functioning market was essential to a prosperous economy, but also spelled out that this did not mean the Fed should protect investors from loss. "Such actions distort asses prices and crucially impair the efficiency of capital allocation," he said. The Fed's lowering of interest rates earlier this week has not spurred "moral hazard" in financial markets, as markets have suffered real losses, he said. Moral hazard refers to when investors act recklessly on the belief that monetary authorities would bail them out under any circumstances. The Fed cut its overnight funds rate by a larger-than-expected half percentage point to 4.75 percent on Tuesday after several weeks of financial market turmoil sparked by problems in the U.S. subprime mortgage market. SUBPRIME THE TRIGGER, NOT CAUSE Earlier in a speech, Warsh said subprime mortgages may have been the spark, but were not the cause of the market's problems, and he said that these were rooted in the complacency of investors. "It seems increasingly apparent that many investors and financial intermediaries became so content with the benign economic conditions and robust financial markets that they tended to act with confidence greater than warranted by the fundamentals," he said. "Indeed, some may have overly relied on credit ratings as sole gatekeepers for evaluating risk. So perhaps, in some sense, markets can become too liquid." "How quickly markets normalize may depend on the speed with which investors and counterparties gain comfort in their abilities to value assets," he added. Warsh said the central bank's interest rate cut this week was designed to shield the economy from market turbulence, not bail out investors. Largely echoing the Fed's statement, he said: "The action was intended to help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might arise from the disruptions in financial markets and promote moderate growth over time." "What originated as a liquidity shock could potentially give rise to increases in credit risk. The (Federal Open Market) Committee will continue to assess the effects of these and other developments on economic prospects and will act as needed to meet our dual mandate, fostering price stability and economic growth," Warsh said.
