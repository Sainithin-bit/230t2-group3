 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Germany's Deutsche Lufthansa ( LHAG.DE ) said it planned to offer 5.7 percent more seating capacity on its global flight network for the winter season, boosted by increases on U.S. and Asian routes. 

 Lufthansa will lift available capacity on international routes by 6.5 percent and on European services by 4 percent in the winter schedule, which runs from October 28 to March 29, it said on Friday. "We are enlarging our long-haul route network, with the focus on America and Asia," said Karl Ulrich Garnadt, board member of Lufthansa's passenger airline. "In Europe, we are further expanding our route network to Eastern Europe and simultaneously raising frequencies on several routes to business destinations," he added. The winter timetable will include 13,272 scheduled flights, 2.9 percent more than in the year-earlier period, Lufthansa said, with new routes planned to Orlando, Karachi and Lahore.
