 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Managing the euro zone's debt crisis requires a three-pronged approach of reinforcing the bloc's bailout fund, bolstering weak banks and helping Greece, ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet said on Wednesday. 
 "What is now necessary is to clarify crisis management in three dimensions: reinforcing the EFSF's capacity to ensure financial stability ... strengthening the balance sheets of the European banks; and working out an appropriate solution for Greece's medium term adjustment," Trichet said in a speech to mark the end of his eight years as ECB President.
