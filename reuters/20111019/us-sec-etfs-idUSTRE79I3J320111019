 WASHINGTON/NEW YORK  (Reuters) - BlackRock, the world's largest money manager, called for regulators to flag riskier exchange-traded funds, a move being met with fierce opposition by rivals who dominate that niche. 
 As U.S. regulators launch a broad review into the roughly $1 trillion ETF sector, a top BlackRock official told lawmakers on Wednesday that better disclosure rules are needed across the market, including its own huge ETF business. But the BlackRock official also urged regulators to adopt a new classification system that would strip the ETF label from more complex products largely offered by competitors -- a proposal that some industry players characterized as self-serving. Noel Archard, a managing director at BlackRock in charge of product development for iShares, said leveraged or inverse ETFs are relative newcomers to the market that carry greater risk and may not be appropriate for many retail investors. BlackRock iShares, which has $538 billion in ETF assets and is the biggest provider in the United States, has no leveraged or inverse ETFs out of the 225 it offers in the United States. Four derivative-based funds it offers would be covered by BlackRock's suggested new classifications. "Calling such products ETFs causes investor confusion and regulators should require a different label," Archard said of leveraged and inverse ETFs at a Senate Banking subcommittee hearing examining risks in that market. A Securities and Exchange Commission official who testified at the hearing on Wednesday said BlackRock's proposal deserves "serious consideration." Other parts of the ETF industry, however, blasted BlackRock's regulatory plan. Michael Sapir, chief executive of ProShares Advisors LLC, the largest provider of inverse and leveraged ETFs, accused BlackRock of using the hearing to "advocate its own agenda." "It appears that they are trying to turn this hearing into a platform to really advance their own competitive interests rather than really talking about the real issues," Sapir told Reuters in an interview. ProShares has $33 billion in total assets of which $27 billion is in leveraged and inverse ETFs. David Nadig, director of research at IndexUniverse.com, which focuses on ETFs, called BlackRock's testimony "a bit self-serving" because the majority of iShares' ETFs would not fall under the new classification it is calling for. "From BlackRock's perspective, that would be just ducky because most of their product line wouldn't fit into that definition," Nadig said. REGULATORY REVIEW Exchange-traded funds such as those managed by BlackRock, State Street and the Vanguard Group, generally track market indexes and trade on exchanges. They have grown to account for roughly $1 trillion in assets since their inception in the 1990s, and have some similarities to mutual funds in how they are structured and managed. Increased scrutiny of exchange-traded products has been fueled by ETFs' performance during major market events like the May 6, 2010 "flash crash" and also by the recent proliferation of more complex exchange-traded products which some say may be confusing to average retail investors. SEC Investment Management Director Eileen Rominger told the hearing on Wednesday that the SEC has launched a broad, agency-wide review of exchange-traded funds. Rominger, a former Goldman Sachs investment officer, said the SEC is looking at investor disclosures, liquidity levels, fair valuations, and potential impact on volatility, among other issues. She did not reveal specific plans for new regulations, but she did give a nod toward BlackRock's proposal. "I think that the classification system that Mr. Archard described is very interesting and deserves serious consideration," Rominger told lawmakers. AN ETF BY ANY OTHER NAME? Many ETF providers and investment advisers say creating another acronym to distinguish complex ETFs from simpler ones will only cause more confusion. "Seven out of 10 investors don't know what an ETF is," said Tom Lydon, president of Global Trends Investments, an adviser managing $85 million. "This would just make it more complicated." The short-term trading nature of these products does not mean they should be denied the ETF label, said Steven Baffico, chief executive of Four Wood Capital Partners, and former head of U.S. retail at Guggenheim Funds Distributors Inc. "It would seem to me that transparent, low-cost exposure to desired markets with ease of execution is really what ETFs were constructed to provide in the first place, isn't it?" he said.
