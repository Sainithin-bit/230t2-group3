 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Medical device maker Medtronic Inc ( MDT.N ) on Tuesday reported sharply lower net earnings on charges related to the acquisition of spinal products company Kyphon Inc. 

 But fiscal third-quarter earnings excluding charges exceeded Wall Street expectations, and the company said it would not be surprised if the consensus estimate for full-year earnings rose, as sales of its implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) to treat rapid heart rhythms recovered following a component recall. Medtronic in October had halted sales of its Sprint Fidelis line of leads, or wires that link the heart to an ICD, after finding that the components may have contributed to five patient deaths. The company increased production of an alternative lead to sell with its ICDs. "After the first month we were able to pretty much pick up the pieces and resume to where we were before this whole situation occurred," Medtronic Chief Executive Bill Hawkins said in an interview. Medtronic said net earnings in the fiscal third quarter ended January 25 were $77 million, or 7 cents a share, compared with $710 million, or 61 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding 56 cents of special charges mostly for the Kyphon purchase, Medtronic said it earned 63 cents a share. On that basis, analysts' average forecast was 61 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Third-quarter revenue rose 12 percent to about $3.41 billion from a year ago, and sales of ICDs increased 2 percent to $726 million. Medtronic is the largest maker of ICDs, with about half of the market for the life-saving devices that can shock a racing heartbeat back to normal rhythm. Hawkins said the Fidelis recall has had a minimal impact on Medtronic's ICD market share despite analysts' predictions that it lost ground. Some analysts, however, said the company did appear to have suffered share erosion, noting competitors Boston Scientific Corp ( BSX.N ) and St. Jude Medical Inc ( STJ.N ) posted stronger ICD growth rates in the quarter. "If everyone's growing faster and you're growing 2-3 percent, you are probably losing some market share," said Morningstar analyst Debbie Wang. Minneapolis-based Medtronic said revenue in its Cardiac Rhythm Disease Management division, which includes both ICDs and pacemakers, rose 3 percent to about $1.22 billion. Revenue from cardiovascular products including stents to treat clogged arteries increased 7 percent to $512 million. Neurological device revenue rose 10 percent to $320 million, and diabetes product revenue increased 14 percent to $258 million. Spinal treatment revenue climbed 35 percent to $808 million, boosted by $147 million in revenue from Kyphon, Medtronic said. "Despite EPS upside, Q3 results confirm our view that the company is losing share in its key franchises (ICDs and core spinal instrumentation), which we think will put a cap on the stock price," Morgan Stanley analyst Glenn Reicin said in a note to clients. Demand for ICDs is still recovering from the negative effect of product recalls in 2005 and 2006 by Boston Scientific's Guidant unit. Medtronic said the U.S. ICD market grew about 2.5 percent in the latest quarter, continuing a recent pace of low-single-digit growth, while the international market grew about 20 percent. Executives said the company would not be surprised if the Wall Street consensus estimate for its fiscal 2008 per-share earnings excluding items rose 2 cents from the current $2.52. Fiscal 2008 earnings will benefit as the company's ICD sales continue to recover from the Fidelis recall;, as the global ICD market strengthens; and as the Kyphon acquisition and the launches of the Endeavor drug-eluting stent and a new pain treatment device bolster sales, Medtronic officials said. Shares of Medtronic rose 52 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $49.64 in late morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock is down 12 percent since the company announced its problems with the Fidelis lead. (Reporting by Susan Kelly, editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
