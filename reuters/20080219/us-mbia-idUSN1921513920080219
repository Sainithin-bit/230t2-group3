 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - MBIA Inc ( MBI.N ) said on Tuesday it replaced its chief executive and wants to separate its municipal bond business from other operations as the bond insurer struggles to hold on to top credit ratings. 

 The world's largest bond insurer, which recently raised capital as expected payouts on subprime mortgage bonds increased, said Joseph "Jay" Brown has returned as chairman and chief executive of MBIA after the ouster on Saturday of former CEO Gary Dunton. The CEO change is the second major executive departure at a U.S. bond insurer in as many months and reflects the turmoil the industry faces amid rising expected losses from repackaged mortgage bonds the insurers had guaranteed. Expected losses are triggering ratings downgrades, calls for more capital at the insurers and big market gyrations for stocks and bonds. Dunton, 52, has helped increase claims paying resources by as much as $3.2 billion in recent months, Brown said, but MBIA's board of directors wanted new leadership to deal with regulators and restructure the company. "He ran that leg of the marathon and I'm running the next one," Brown said in a telephone interview. Brown, 59, said in a statement issued on Tuesday that he spoke to New York State Insurance Superintendent Eric Dinallo, who is trying to broker a solution to the problems facing MBIA and its rivals. "I believe we can look forward to improved dialogue with the department," Brown added in the statement. Brown said MBIA needs to reorganize itself so its municipal finance business is separate from the structured finance business, which guarantees securities such as repackaged mortgage bonds. The municipal bond business is widely expected to face minimal payouts in coming years. It is not clear how the division will take place, but in five years, Brown expects MBIA to have separate units for municipal bond insurance, structured finance guarantees, asset management and perhaps a few other products. The units will be capitalized separately. "My guess is our cost of raising capital would have been a lot cheaper" if the businesses had been separate during the most recent round of capital raising, Brown said. The shares of Armonk, New York-based MBIA have plunged more than 83 percent in the past year, including a 4.4 percent drop on Tuesday to close at $11.70. DUNTON FOLLOWS GENADER MBIA's leadership change comes after Ambac Financial Group Inc ABK.N said in mid-January that chief executive Robert Genader was retiring, in part because he disagreed with the board of directors about the insurer's plans to raise capital. In an interview with CNBC, Brown was optimistic a deal involving New York state could happen in the next two weeks. Between 1999 and 2004, Brown was chief executive of MBIA and its main unit, MBIA Insurance Corp. He joined the firm as a director in 1986 and retired last May. MBIA, known in industry parlance as a "monoline" bond insurer, originally focused on the relatively safe business of guaranteeing municipal bonds, but over the last decade devoted increasing energy to the riskier activity of backing structured mortgage securities and other repackaged debt. That strategy fueled growth, but led to rising losses during the past year as housing sales sputtered and credit markets seized up. New York regulators are trying to orchestrate a rescue so bond insurers can maintain their triple-A ratings. FGIC Corp has said it is planning to split itself in two, while Ambac is also considering splitting up its businesses. New York Governor Eliot Spitzer, to whom Dinallo reports, is less interested in a specific timetable for a plan to help rescue bond insurers than in finding the right solution, his spokeswoman said on Tuesday. Spitzer told reporters last week a solution could happen "within a couple of days." Spitzer told reporters in Albany on Tuesday that he was "making good progress" in talks with the U.S. Treasury, the Federal Reserve, and major banks to help bond insurers keep their top "AAA" ratings. Last Wednesday, MBIA completed the sale of $1.1 billion of stock at $12.15 a share and the stock closed New York Stock Exchange trading on Friday at $12.24. MBIA said it finalizing the terms of a severance agreement with Dunton. MBIA has agreed to treat Dunton's departure as essentially not being for "cause." In a regulatory filing, MBIA said Brown would receive a salary of $500,000 and would be eligible for a cash bonus of up to $2 million. He also agreed to buy 359,000 MBIA shares at $12.15 per share, or $4.36 million worth, with his own funds. Pending shareholder approval, Brown also would receive 1.63 million shares of performance-based restricted stock, plus an additional $5 million in stock to be granted in one year. The restricted stock will vest within 5 years if MBIA's share price reaches or exceeds $40. (Additional reporting by  Christian Plumb ) (Editing by Dave Zimmerman,  Andre Grenon ,  Toni Reinhold )
