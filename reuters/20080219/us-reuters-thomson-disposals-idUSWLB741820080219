 LONDON  (Reuters) - Thomson Corp TOC.TO and Reuters RTR.L are in preliminary talks with a number of parties regarding the databases they need to make available in order to win regulatory approval for their deal. 

 Thomson and Reuters said on Tuesday they had agreed to sell copies of their financial databases -- Thomson's Worldscope, Reuters Estimates, Reuters Aftermarket Research and Reuters EcoWin -- in order to meet conditions set by the European Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice. "We are in preliminary discussions with a number of parties, we don't believe, given the interest in these assets, that disposal will be an issue," Reuters Chief Executive Tom Glocer told reporters on a conference call.
