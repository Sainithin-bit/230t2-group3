 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. conglomerate General Electric Co 
( GE.N ) is expected to make changes to its accounting policies 
in a bid to end a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 
probe, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday citing 
people familiar with the situation. 

  The three-year-long probe, which is looking more closely at 
how GE recognizes revenue, could continue for another year, 
said the Journal citing people familiar with the situation.  GE said in October it would be making adjustments to its 
previously filed financial statements party due to incorrectly 
estimating contract profitability at its aviation business.  (Reporting by  Yinka Adegoke )
