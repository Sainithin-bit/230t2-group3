 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - ConAgra Foods Inc ( CAG.N ) said on Tuesday that earnings in its third quarter, ending February 24, would come in higher than expected, thanks to strong performance of its trading and merchandise segment and its food and ingredients unit. 

 The company also said in the future, it expects earnings per share to grow in the range of 8 percent to 10 percent, excluding items that may affect comparisons. The company's announcement comes as it provides a business update at the Consumer Analyst Group of New York's annual conference in Boca Raton, Florida.
