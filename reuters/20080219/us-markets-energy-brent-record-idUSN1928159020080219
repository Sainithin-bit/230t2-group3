 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - London Brent crude CLc1 leaped almost 4 percent to a record high on Tuesday, lifted by concerns over tight supply as OPEC was expected to keep production tight. 

 Brent for April delivery LCOJ8 hit an intraday high of $98.70 per barrel, surging $3.79 or 3.99 percent. That surpassed the previous record of $98.50 set on January 3. (Reporting by  Gene Ramos ; Editing by John Picinich)
