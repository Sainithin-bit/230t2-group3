 OTTAWA  (Reuters) - Canada's Competition Bureau said on Tuesday it would not challenge Thomson Corporation's TOC.TO takeover of Reuters RTR.L, following similar moves by U.S. and European authorities. 

 The regulator said Thomson's commitment to divest certain assets, based on remedies negotiated with U.S. and European authorities, eased any concerns it may have had over competition issues.
