 LONDON/DUBAI  (Reuters) - OPEC will find it difficult to cut its oil output because prices are again rising toward a record high, Libya's top oil official and OPEC sources said on Tuesday. 

 The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meets in Vienna on March 5 and some members including Iran have urged the group to lower output, even though oil is trading above $98 a barrel. "There is still more than two weeks to go and prices are at $98," Libya's National Oil Corporation Chairman Shokri Ghanem told Reuters by telephone. "It is too early to say." "We know that it is not all fundamentals, but whenever the price is like this, it is difficult to cut." Earlier on Tuesday, OPEC sources said a reduction was unlikely to be decided at the meeting because of rising prices and uncertainty about supply from Venezuela and Nigeria. "Prices are high and this is not the time to talk about a cut," said an OPEC delegate from one of the group's larger producers, who declined to be identified by name. "It is too early at this time to make a definitive statement, but the logic would be no change," said a second source familiar with OPEC policy. Nigeria's oil output has been hit by militant attacks and fellow OPEC member Venezuela is threatening to halt oil sales to the United States over a dispute with the world's biggest oil firm, Exxon Mobil. The 13 OPEC members pump about 40 percent of the world's oil. NO INCREASE Oil rose above $98 a barrel on Tuesday, closing in on a record high of $100.09 reached on January 3. Prices were up in part because OPEC President Chakib Khelil, who is also Algeria's oil minister, told Reuters on Monday "production is not going to increase -- it will either decrease or be stable". Iran, OPEC's second-largest producer, is prominent among those calling for a reduction. "The normal course of events is that we should have a cut in production in March but we will have to review market conditions and world reserves before deciding by how much," Iran's oil minister, Gholamhossein Nozari, said on Sunday. At meetings in December and earlier in February, OPEC opted to maintain its output targets, despite calls from consumer nations for more supply to rein in high prices. Analysts have suggested that OPEC could decide to trim supply quietly if needed to stop prices falling too far, but would be unlikely to announce a formal reduction in its supply target next month. Supply by the 12 OPEC members, all except Iraq, that pump oil at agreed levels has been rising, according to outside estimates. The 12 in January pumped 30.2 million barrels per day, up 410,000 bpd from December, according to a Reuters survey. OPEC oil ministers will have another chance to discuss the oil market on the sidelines of the International Energy Forum, a gathering of producers and consumers, taking place in Rome on April 20-22.
