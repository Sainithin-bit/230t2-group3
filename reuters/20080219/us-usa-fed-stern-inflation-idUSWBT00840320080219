 GOLDEN VALLEY, Minnesota  (Reuters) - Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Gary Stern on Tuesday said that recent inflation readings have been higher than his preference but should go down over time. 

 Policy-makers should target inflation levels over the long run and should not try to affect month-to-month swings in inflation levels, he said in response to questions after speaking to the Financial Planning Association of Minnesota. (Reporting by  Mark Felsenthal ; Editing by Theodore d'Afflisio)
