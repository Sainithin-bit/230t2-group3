 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Some major hospitals are switching from using a heparin blood thinner product made by Baxter International Inc ( BAX.N ) to one produced by its rival APP Pharmaceuticals Inc APPX.O, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday. 

 The Journal said APP is rapidly increasing its production of heparin after Baxter was forced to halt sales of its heparin product following reports of hundreds of allergic reactions in patients who used its blood thinner. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said last week it has never inspected the Chinese plant that was the source for much of the active ingredient in Baxter's product. The Journal said the FDA said it had inspected the Chinese operation that produces some active ingredient for APP and plans to inspect the Baxter supplier's Chinese operation this week. Spokespeople for Baxter, APP and the FDA were not immediately available. (Reporting by  Yinka Adegoke ; Editing by Paul Bolding)
