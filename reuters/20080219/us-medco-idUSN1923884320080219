 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Medco Health Solutions Inc MHS.N reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings on Tuesday, helped by sales of generic drugs, and the pharmacy benefit manager boosted its full-year profit forecast, sending its shares higher. 

 Medco, which derives more than half its profit from mail-order delivery of generic medicines, said its rosier outlook reflected confidence in its fundamentals, new business, and more generics becoming available sooner than anticipated. Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), which administer prescription drug benefits for employers and health plans and operate large mail-order pharmacies, have profited from the availability of low-cost generic versions of popular drugs. Morgan Stanley analyst David Veal said in a research note, "Another quarter of solid growth, when coupled with higher guidance, affirm our positive view of the PBM industry and should offer relief for the high level of investor nervousness around the quarter." After a huge gain in 2007, Medco shares had fallen 3 percent this year through Friday's close, compared with a 13 percent drop for rival Express Scripts Inc ( ESRX.O ). Medco shares rose $2.10, or 4 percent, to $51.08 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Express Scripts shares were up $3.17, or 5 percent, to $66.87. Medco's fourth-quarter net income fell 9 percent to $207.6 million, or 38 cents per share, from $228.8 million, or 39 cents per share, a year earlier. The latest results were hurt by higher-than-expected costs tied to new clients and expenses related to two acquisitions. The year-earlier earnings were boosted by the temporary availability of a generic version of a popular blood thinner. Excluding special items, earnings were 43 cents per share, 2 cents above analysts' average forecast, according to Reuters Estimates. "This was another strong quarter for (Medco), with strength across most segments," Deutsche Bank analyst Barbara Ryan said in a note. Quarterly revenue rose 4 percent to $11.4 billion. Medco's adjusted volume of prescriptions handled rose 1.3 percent to 190 million. Its volume of prescriptions delivered by mail increased 8 percent to 24.4 million. The Franklin Lakes, New Jersey-based company said a record 61.4 percent of prescriptions handled were for generic drugs, up from 57.3 percent a year ago. Sales in its specialty pharmacy segment, which include more complex drugs that often are infused, rose 12 percent to nearly $1.6 billion. "Medco continues to deliver strong results, driven by generics and specialty," JP Morgan analyst Lisa Gill said in a research note. Medco increased its 2008 profit forecast, excluding special items, to a range of $2.27 to $2.31 per share, representing growth of as much as 27 percent over 2007. Previously, it forecast $2.15 to $2.21 per share. Analysts expect $2.20 per share. Newly available generic versions of Merck & Co Inc's ( MRK.N ) blockbuster osteoporosis drug Fosamax are expected to help results this year.
