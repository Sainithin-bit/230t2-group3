 BEIJING  (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell ( RDSa.L ) is drilling 17 wells in China, including for tight gas and shale gas, Chief Executive Peter Voser told Reuters on Sunday. 

 If the drilling is successful, Shell aims to spend $1 billion a year over the next five years on shale gas in China, he said on the sidelines of a forum, adding that it was already spending $400 million on unconventional gas in China this year. (Reporting by Chen Aizhu)
