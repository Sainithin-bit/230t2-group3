 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - Dutch Finance Minister Jan Kees de Jager said on Sunday he was willing to propose Dutch Central Bank President Nout Wellink as European Central Bank (ECB) president if Jean-Claude Trichet steps down end-October. 

 "The favorite candidate from Germany has left. The game seems to be open again. If this would lead to new insights, we will think about it," De Jager told Dutch current affairs television programme Buitenhof. "The first ECB president was a Dutchman, (Wim) Duisenberg, and now we have a Frenchman. So it would be strange to have a Dutchman again but Duisenberg did not fully complete his term," De Jager said.
