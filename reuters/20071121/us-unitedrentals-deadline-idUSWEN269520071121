 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - United Rentals Inc ( URI.N ) said on Wednesday that it was fulfilling all its obligations under a $4 billion takeover deal struck in July with Cerberus, and said it stood ready to complete the transaction. 

 United Rentals said this was demonstrated by it extending the expiration date for previously announced debt tender offers. Cerberus pulled its takeover offer for United Rentals last week. United Rentals said on Monday that it filed a lawsuit seeking to force Cerberus to complete the deal. Cerberus said earlier on Wednesday it was taking legal action to ensure United Rentals honors the terms of the deal which Cerberus says caps its liability at $100 million. (Editing by Carol Bishopric)
