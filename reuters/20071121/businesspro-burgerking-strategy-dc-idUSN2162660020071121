 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Burger King Corp BKC.N, the world's 
No. 2 hamburger chain, plans to test a $1 double cheeseburger 
that would challenge one of industry-leading McDonald's Corp's 
( MCD.N ) best-selling items, the Wall Street Journal said 
Wednesday in its online edition. 

  "It is our belief that the dollar double cheeseburger is 
the most powerful weapon our competitor has, to continue their 
growth and steal disproportionate share from the category," a 
note emailed to Burger King employees and franchisees from the 
company's chief marketing officer said in disclosing the test, 
according to the Journal.  Burger King said it will feature a larger double 
cheeseburger than McDonald's at a heavily discounted rate in 
three unidentified U.S. markets early next year, the Journal 
said.  Representatives of Burger King could not immediately be 
reached for comment.  McDonald's, the world's largest restaurant company, has 
outperformed many other restaurant chains and retailers this 
year, with breakfast items and new menu choices like chicken 
snack wraps doing well in the United States, and extended 
restaurant hours helping in Asia and Australia.  Earlier this month, Burger King said its results were 
boosted by new chicken sandwiches on its menu, expanded store 
hours, and marketing promotions featuring the Simpsons and 
Transformers.  (Reporting by  Justin Grant ; Editing by  Valerie Lee )
