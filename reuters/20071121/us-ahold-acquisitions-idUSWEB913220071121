 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - Dutch supermarket group Ahold ( AHLN.AS )AHO.N is on the lookout for acquisitions in the regions where it has operations, its chief executive said on Wednesday. 

 "We will continue to look for opportunities to acquire businesses in geographical regions we operate in," CEO John Rishton told reporters on a conference call. He declined to provide details. Analysts have said smaller Belgian rival Delhaize ( DELB.BR ) would make a good merger candidate. Ahold owns the Netherlands' biggest supermarket chain Albert Heijn but derives 60 percent of its sales in the United States. (Reporting by  Foo Yun Chee )
