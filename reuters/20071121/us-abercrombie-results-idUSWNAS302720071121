 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Abercrombie & Fitch Co ( ANF.N ) reported a 15 percent rise in quarterly profit on Wednesday, helped by strength in its namesake chain of stores and improved margins, and stuck by its profit outlook for the second half of the year, which includes the holiday season. 

 The results come after numerous apparel retailers reported weak third-quarter sales and cut their holiday forecasts as the uncertain economic environment, unseasonably warm weather and a lack of must-have items crimp sales. Citigroup upgraded shares of the retailer, which sells trendy fashions for teenagers and young adults, to "buy" from "hold," saying its "accelerating international growth, more conservative inventory management ... and easing comparisons could drive accelerating earnings per share growth." Its shares rose $2.85 or 3.9 percent to $75.64 in afternoon New York Stock Exchange trading. The mall-based retailer said net income for its third quarter, ended November 3, rose to $117.6 million, or $1.29 per share, from $102.0 million, or $1.11 per share, a year earlier. Analysts, on average, had been expecting $1.28 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. "Despite the tough macro environment, our business remained consistent, which speaks to the strength and the differentiation of our brand," Mike Kramer, Abercrombie's chief financial officer, said on a call with analysts. "We generated solid sales growth, gross margin expansion and strong earnings growth," he said. SALES TRENDS Abercrombie said third-quarter sales rose 13 percent to $973.9 million. Same-store sales, a key retail gauge that measures sales at stores open at least a year, increased 1 percent. Same-store sales rose 3 percent at both its namesake Abercrombie & Fitch chain and its Abercrombie children's chain but fell 1 percent at its Hollister chain and 7 percent at its RUEHL stores. Price increases on its merchandise and lower losses of inventory theft or shoplifting helped offset higher markdowns compared with a year earlier. The company said its RUEHL stores, which first opened in 2004 and are geared toward 22- to 30-year-olds, are not performing as well as it would like, but it is still "very bullish" on the brand. The retailer said its brands "are not intended to appeal to everyone," which limits expansion potential, but it is looking at international markets to bolster its growth. "While we are less than halfway to full potential from a store expansion standpoint domestically, we are increasing focus on expanding the A&F and Hollister brands on an international basis," Kramer said. He said the company is pursuing projects that have the highest returns on capital and the lowest risk. Abercrombie will open a Tokyo flagship store in late 2009, its first store in Asia. The retailer also plans to introduce a new concept, what it is calling a "fifth concept," in January with the opening of four stores. For the second half of its fiscal year, it forecast earnings per share of $3.63 to $3.67. It said the low end of the outlook is based on flat same-store sales for the fourth quarter. For its current fiscal year, it expects to increase its gross square-footage roughly 10 percent, mainly through the addition of six new Abercrombie & Fitch stores, 25 new Abercrombie stores, 58 new Hollister Co stores, seven new RUEHL stores, and four stores of its new concept.
