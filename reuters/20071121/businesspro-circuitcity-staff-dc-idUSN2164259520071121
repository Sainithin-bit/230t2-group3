 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Circuit City Stores Inc CC.N, which 
replaced 3,400 workers earlier this year with lower-paid 
employees, is asking some former staff to return, the Wall 
Street Journal said Wednesday in its online edition. 

  According to the Journal, a spokesman for the consumer 
electronics retailer said workers discharged in March are among 
former employees who have received letters inviting them to 
apply for positions either created by new store openings or 
routine turnover.  Representatives of Circuit City could not immediately be 
reached for comment.  The newspaper said job openings are largely for two types 
of employees: product specialists, who concentrate on sales, 
and members of the product flow team, who accept product 
deliveries and arrange merchandise displays.  The consumer electronics retailer, which is in the midst of 
a multiyear effort to revamp its business and win back market 
share from larger rival Best Buy Co ( BBY.N ), has been trying to 
reduce expenses amid heavy competition.  (Reporting by  Justin Grant ; Editing by  David Holmes )
