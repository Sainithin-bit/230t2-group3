 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Children's Place Retail Stores Inc ( PLCE.O ) on Wednesday reported net income of $11.8 million for its fiscal third quarter, which it said was hurt by unusually warm weather, unappealing merchandise and a challenging macroenvironment. 

 The results included about $4 million, or 9 cents a share, in severance expenses and about $2.3 million, or 5 cents a share, related to investigation fees incurred in the quarter, ended November 3. The company said the results were preliminary and that it would not provide earnings on a per-share basis until it finishes its historical financial statements and files delinquent reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The company could be delisted by the Nasdaq stock market if its fails to file its statements by January 9. Consolidated net sales rose 7 percent to $587.4 million in the quarter, less than planned. Merchandise that did not resonate with customers, unusually warm weather and a "challenging macroeconomic environment" hurt sales at its namesake and Disney-branded stores, interim Chief Executive Chuck Crovitz said in a statement. "All of these issues resulted in significant margin pressure as we increased promotional activity to clear through merchandise," Crovitz said. To strengthen earnings, the company said it would invest more conservatively in inventory, slow the rate of capital spending and store openings particularly its namesake stores, and cut costs. Separately, Children's Place appointed Richard Paradise as senior vice president of finance and said it expects him to become chief financial officer once its delinquent SEC reports are filed. Paradise was previously the CFO for the Bath & Kitchen division at American Standard Cos Inc ASD.N.
