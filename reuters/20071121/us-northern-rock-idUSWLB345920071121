 LONDON  (Reuters) - Stricken British bank Northern Rock NRK.L has received more rescue proposals, but warned that one of them contemplated an offer well below Tuesday's closing price, wiping another 12 percent off its value on Wednesday. 

 The auction of Northern Rock was slammed by one of its major shareholders, hedge fund RAB Capital, which said the bank should not be broken up, but should be continued as a going concern. Northern Rock declined to disclose the number or names of its suitors. U.S. buyout firm JC Flowers has made what is believed to be the only offer for all of Northern Rock, but it only includes a "nominal value" for shareholders, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters on Tuesday. Another person said rival buyout firm Cerberus had made a proposal, and a consortium led by Richard Branson's Virgin Group VA.UL and Olivant, an investment group led by veteran troubleshooter Luqman Arnold, said they have submitted offers. Northern Rock said that one of the offers on the table was for all the company but at "materially below" its price at Tuesday's close. "The company's advisors have begun discussions with a number of selected interested parties to clarify their proposals," it added in a statement. Northern Rock shares fell 12.6 percent to 84.8 pence, as dealers said it appears increasingly likely shareholders will not get much for their holdings. It was the seventh successive daily fall and cut the bank's value to 360 million pounds ($741 million), down almost 90 percent since the start of September. MORE BIDDERS? Philip Richards, chief executive of RAB Capital, which built up a stake of more than 6 percent in Northern Rock in September, said he was confident some shareholder value can be salvaged, but criticized the auction process. "What the government should be doing having caused a huge mess is working with the company. There are other stronger management teams putting themselves forward. It shouldn't be broken up, it should continue as a going concern," he said. Richards said he expected other bidders who have not yet been identified to emerge. Northern Rock had also been hurt by the Bank of England's lending policy during the crisis, Richards said, in contrast with the U.S. Federal Reserve or the European Central Bank. "People are borrowing left, right and centre elsewhere. It's only in the UK that a bank gets named and shamed and destroyed in the process," he said. The union representing Northern Rock staff also on Wednesday called on any buyer to keep Northern Rock as a listed company and to recognize its 6,200 staff as a key stakeholder. Unite the Union urged a buyer to ensure long-term job security and continue the work of the Northern Rock charitable foundation. Northern Rock was forced to go to the Bank of England for emergency loans two months ago, as the global squeeze on credit caused its funding strategy to collapse, prompting the first run on a British bank for over 140 years. It shares have since plunged and its borrowing from the Bank of England is estimated to have reached 25 billion pounds as the authorities desperately cast around for a buyer. U.S. buyout firm Apollo and Dutch bank ING ( ING.AS ) have also been tipped as potential bidders for Northern Rock. Paragon ( PARA.L ), Britain's third biggest buy-to-let lender, fall sharply for a second day after its warning that it could collapse or need to launch a 280 million pound rights issue as it faces financing problems amid the credit crunch. Paragon shares slumped 36 percent to 80p, cutting its value to under 100 million pounds, down over 60 percent this week. (Additional reporting by  Mark Potter , Editing by Sue Thomas)
