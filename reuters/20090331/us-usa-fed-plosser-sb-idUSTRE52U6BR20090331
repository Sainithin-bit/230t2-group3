 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve needs to brace for outside pressure when it dismantles its various lending programs, as it must to prevent a longer-run jump in inflation, Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser said on Tuesday. 

 "When financial markets begin to operate normally and the outlook for the economy improves, our balance sheet must contract," Plosser said in a speech at the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business. But various interest groups are likely to cry foul when the Fed starts to end any of its programs, saying markets are too fragile or the economy still too weak, he said. "Such pressures could threaten the Fed's independence to control its balance sheet and monetary policy. We will need to have the fortitude to make some difficult decisions about when our policies must be reversed or unwound," he added. Plosser said that while he opposed lending policies by the Fed that "stray into the realm of allocating credit across firms or sectors of the economy," terming any move in that direction is the responsibility of the Treasury. Suggestions that the Fed become the U.S. financial system's top overseer also needed to be handled "with great care," said Plosser, who is not a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee in 2009. "We must avoid giving the Fed a mandate for financial or systematic stability that is too vague or too sweeping ... over-promising puts the central bank's credibility at risk," he said. Any such diminishing of the Fed's credibility would threaten the U.S. central bank's ability to meet its core monetary policy objectives of stable prices and sustainable economic growth, Plosser warned. "Instability or volatility in the general level of prices can also be a significant source of financial instability ... we must make sure that in trying to cure one source of financial instability, we do not sow the seeds of another," he noted. Plosser also called for authorities to tackle the issue of "too big to fail," whereby some banks or financial institutions are seen as too large or interconnected to go under. Market discipline breaks down when creditors believe they are never at risk, and firms are thus given incentives to become too large, merely in order to exploit the implicit guarantee of a government bailout, he said. Plosser warned that the Fed, despite hundreds of billions of dollars pumped into the financial system since 2007 through an array of lending programs, has "not articulated what I think are sufficient guidelines that govern these decisions." "The mere act of creating the Fed's special lending programs has created moral hazard," he said. "Intervening too often or expanding too broadly the set of institutions that have access to the central bank's credit facilities can ... increase the probability and severity of a future financial crisis."
