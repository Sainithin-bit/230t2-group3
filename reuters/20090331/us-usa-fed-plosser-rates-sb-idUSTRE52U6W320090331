 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Philadelphia Federal Reserve President Charles Plosser said on Tuesday he is cautiously optimistic about the prospects for the U.S. economy to grow in the second half of 2009. 

 It is important for the Fed to consider the lag involved in monetary policy and get ahead of potentially rising inflation, even by raising interest rates before the U.S. jobless rate peaks, Plosser told reporters after a speech. "Unemployment is a lagging economic indicator. The economy is going to turn around long before unemployment rates peak," he said. "There'll come a time when we have to start raising rates and draining all this liquidity." The Fed in the past has sometimes been too slow to start tightening its policy after an economic downturn, particularly in the 1970s, he said.
