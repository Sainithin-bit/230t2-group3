 LONDON  (Reuters) - Global stocks looked set on Tuesday to achieve their best monthly performance in more than six years in March, while commodity prices also rose and the Japanese yen fell. 

 The MSCI World index put on 0.7 percent and was on course to record its biggest monthly rise since October 2002. But the global stock index is still down 12 percent this quarter after losing 22.7 percent in the October-December period last year. "The market has snapped back from yesterday. The falls were probably overdone. Now it is a wait and see approach for investors with important U.S. sentiment data coming out later -- the Chicago PMI figures and U.S. consumer confidence," said Heino Ruland, strategist at Ruland Research in Frankfurt. Euro zone inflation plunged to an all-time low in March, halving its annual rate from February and strengthening the case for a deep European Central bank interest rate cut just two days before the ECB meets. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European firms rose 2 percent, and UK retailer Marks & Spencer soared more than 10 percent after reporting a smaller-than-feared drop in fourth quarter underlying sales, lifting other embattled retailers. The pan-European index is up for the month, but still down 13 percent in the first three months of the year. The futures for Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq rose 1 to 1.2 percent, pointing to a higher open on Wall Street. UBS said its equity risk appetite indicator improved to -1.7 from -1.81, moving higher for the third straight week. "The indicator remains above extreme risk averse territory," it said in a note. "Twelve month equity returns when the index is between -3 and -1.5 have tended to be low and even negative historically." Japanese unemployment rose to a three-year high in February as a deepening recession put more people out of work, and Prime Minister Taro Aso said he planned to submit an extra budget to fund a new stimulus package but was mum on how much the government would spend to shore the recession-hit economy. The announcement came two days before world leaders gather in London to discuss ways out of the global crisis. Tokyo's Nikkei average ended down 1.5 percent. Japanese blue chips managed to gain more than 7 percent this month as the country's financial year draws to a close, but were down 8.5 percent in the first quarter. The yen also fell broadly, while the euro rose 0.95 percent to $1.3327. "A lot of today's trading is all about quarter-end flows and the end of the Japanese fiscal year, with dollar/eyn gaining as the new fiscal year gets underway," State Street foreign exchange strategist Lee Ferridge said. World Bank President Robert Zoellick said the dollar would remain the world's dominant reserve currency and a strong U.S. currency is critical to pull the world out of crisis. STRONG DOLLAR NEEDED Base metal prices rose, and crude rose above $49 a barrel, recouping some of the previous session's 7 percent loss as stock markets edged up. Leaders from the Group of 20 rich and big developing economies will address a crisis that has felled major banks and cost millions of jobs as the world faces its biggest recession since the 1930s. Officials have already acknowledged the G20 summit would fall short of an overhaul of the world economy. U.S. and European leaders have also differed over whether more spending or more regulatory reform would be a better response to the crisis. Government bonds were mixed. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rose by 2 basis points but the euro zone benchmark 10-year bund fell by 4 basis point.
