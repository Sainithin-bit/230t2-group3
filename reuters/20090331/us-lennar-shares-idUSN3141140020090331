 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of Lennar Corp ( LEN.N ) fell as much as 15.6 percent on Tuesday, a day after the No. 2 U.S. homebuilder reported a wider quarterly loss. 

 While Lennar led the sector down, homebuilder shares fell across the board after a Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller report showed prices of U.S. single-family homes declined by a record 19 percent in January from a year earlier. The Dow Jones U.S. Home Construction Index .DJUSHB was down almost 5 percent, compared with a 1 percent rise in the Standard & Poor's 500 index  .SPX . Lennar posted a loss of $155.9 million, or 98 cents a share, for its fiscal first quarter, ended February 28, compared with a year-earlier loss of $88.2 million, or 56 cents a share. The company's shares were down $1.18 to $7.53 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange after falling as low as $7.35 earlier. (Reporting by  Helen Chernikoff ; editing by John Wallace)
