 LONDON  (Reuters) - Barclays said it is in exclusive talks to sell its iShares asset management unit to private equity firm CVC Partners, in a deal likely to be worth about 3 billion pounds ($4.3 billion). 

 Barclays said CVC was its preferred bidder, confirming an earlier Reuters report. The deal is likely to be worth about 3 billion pounds, a person familiar with the situation said. The sale would not include the securities lending business of San Francisco-based Barclays Global Investors (BGI), the parent of iShares. Barclays will retain a roughly 20 percent exposure to iShares -- a leading exchange traded funds provider offering products tracking an index -- through warrants, the source said. Barclays shares trimmed earlier gains after the report and closed down 0.7 percent at 148 pence, underperforming a strong bank sector and valuing it at just over 12 billion pounds. Analysts had put the value of iShares at about 3 billion pounds, though bank industry sources had said bidders could be willing to bid near 4 billion pounds, but that may have included the securities lending business. Excluding the securities lending business will make the deal less complex with U.S. regulators, the source said. A second source said one of the other bidders had wanted to include that shared business, which had made it harder to value the business. Barclays is expected to lend CVC a significant portion of the money required to finance the deal. Although the price tag is lower than some expectations the sale will still produce a substantial capital gain, seen as the key issue for Barclays. "It should be enough to push their core Tier 1 ratio north of 7 percent, which is what the market wants to see," said Simon Maughan, analyst at MF Global. Barclays' core Tier 1 ratio was 6.7 percent at the end of December. It said on Friday it did not need to raise any fresh capital after Britain's financial regulator subjected it to a strict stress test and was satisfied its balance sheet could withstand more pain. CAPITAL BOOST It was not clear whether CVC was bidding alone, or whether it was part of a consortium. CVC declined to comment. Goldman Sachs had earlier been mooted as a potential bidder, as were Bain Capital and a consortium of Hellman & Friedman and Apax Partners. A deal could be reached late this week but could be delayed into next week, sources said. Barclays on Monday rejected an offer to take part in a British government plan to insure risky assets, saying it was not in the economic interests of its investors. Joining the scheme could have increased political interference, analysts said. Barclays is also expected to consider joining other banks in offering to exchange low-ranked bonds for higher quality debt to boost balance sheet quality. The bank has 34 billion pounds of Tier 1 and Tier 2 bonds, and buying back 7.5 billion pounds of those could increase its core Tier 1 ratio by about 1.2 percent, analysts at Credit Suisse said in a note on Tuesday.
