 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Department store chain Macy's Inc ( M.N )said on Tuesday it recorded an estimated pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of around $5.4 billion in 2008. 

 The charge was within the range of $4.5 billion to $5.5 billion previously forecast by Macy's. The company said its goodwill impairment estimate is subject to further adjustment in the first quarter of 2009. The non-cash write-down of goodwill is expected to have no impact on the company's business, bank credit agreement or bond indentures. The primary causes for the goodwill impairments are the deterioration in the general economic environment and the resulting decline in the company's share price and market capitalization, according to Macy's.
