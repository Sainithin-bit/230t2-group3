 TOKYO  (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama has ordered General Motors Corp and Chrysler LLC to accelerate their survival efforts and brace for possible bankruptcy, saying neither had done enough to justify the taxpayer money they were seeking. 

 Here are questions and answers on how this could affect Asia's carmakers. WHAT WOULD A DETROIT CARMAKER'S BANKRUPTCY MEAN? Bankruptcy of either GM or Chrysler would have a detrimental domino effect that would disrupt the supply chain and trigger more plant closures and job losses, further sapping demand. Many suppliers to U.S. automakers also provide components for "transplant" factories owned by Japanese carmakers such as Toyota Motor Corp, Honda Motor Co and Nissan Motor Co. That means those carmakers may have to take the costly step of extending financial assistance to key suppliers and/or flying parts from other supply centers, provided they have a fall-back supplier. The same goes for dealers that sell cars across multiple brands. A massive round of job losses would also knock consumer sentiment, hurting all brands doing business in the United States, the world's top car market until it was overtaken by China earlier this year. ARE ANY ASIAN AUTOMAKERS LIKELY TO COME TO DETROIT'S AID? No Japanese or Korean carmaker appears interested. Indian automakers are on the sidelines after Tata Motors Ltd's costly and so far unsuccessful purchase of Ford Motor Co's premier Jaguar and Land Rover brands last year. Some Chinese carmakers may be interested in parts of the Detroit giants' businesses. Ford's Volvo Cars and GM's Hummer, Saturn, Opel and Saab brands are on the block. But Chinese carmakers rumored to be possible buyers such as Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd and Chery Automobile, have expressed cautious interest at best, while the Chinese government appears to be steering its carmakers away from such acquisitions. As for joint venture companies in China, GM's partner SAIC Motor may welcome an increased stake in their alliance, but GM would likely be reluctant to relinquish its hold since those operations are a rare cash cow in the current industry. ARE ASIAN RIVALS IN Favor OF THE U.S. AUTO INDUSTRY BAILOUT? Many executives say yes, as long as it does not go beyond an effort to help the carmakers get back on their feet. What they don't want is excessive aid that would foster unfair competition and protectionist moves. South Korea's Kia Motors might be better placed as it imports nearly all the vehicles it sells in the U.S. HOW HAS THE MARKET REACTED? Japan's transport equipment index, which includes the major Japanese auto companies and suppliers, has tumbled 42 percent in nine months since the crisis deepened in mid-2008. General Motors has lost three-quarters of its value in the same period, while Ford is down 43 percent. WHAT WOULD BE AN IDEAL SCENARIO FOR ASIAN AUTOMAKERS? A soft landing that would keep the U.S. automakers alive but see them gradually concede market share to stronger Asian brands, as they had been in their home market before the current crisis hit.
