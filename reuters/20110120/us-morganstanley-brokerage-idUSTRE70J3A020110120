 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley's wealth management division attracted $14 billion in new client assets during the fourth quarter, bringing the division back on track to meet growth targets set by Chief Executive James Gorman. 

 The division, which includes a 51 percent stake in the brokerage giant Morgan Stanley Smith Barney and a business serving high-net-worth investors, posted net income of $272 million, up 68 percent from a year earlier. Morgan Stanley retained $166 million of that profit, with the remainder going to joint venture partner Citigroup Inc. The quarter marked an upturn in the brokerage's performance, which has been largely disappointing since Morgan Stanley and Citigroup combined their wealth businesses in May 2009. Last year, after the bank reported the outflow of assets, Morgan Stanley executives told investors the targets may take longer to reach. Now, the latest asset inflows show the integration of two long-time rival brokerages is "proceeding well," said Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat in an interview with Reuters. "The new assets are a good sign in what has been a challenging environment," said Alois Pirker, research director at Aite Group. "Even in a good year, $14 billion is a good quarter." Integration costs were $63 million for the quarter versus $83 million in the third quarter. The combination of the two businesses is on track to be completed by 2012, Gorman said during a call with analysts. Other targets set by Gorman for this year, including $50 billion in net new assets and a pretax profit margin exceeding 20 percent, remain "very market dependent," Porat said. The fourth-quarter pretax profit margin was 12 percent. Key to boost profit margins are completing the integration of Morgan Stanley and Smith Barney while also expanding the number of loans and mortgages advisers sell to clients, Porat told analysts. Revenue for the division rose 7 percent to $3.4 billion, largely as net interest income rose by $195 million, more than doubling from last year. Commissions rose 4 percent, though management and other fees fell by 4 percent. Morgan Stanley's ranks of financial advisers continued to shrink, down 76 advisers during the fourth quarter to 18,043 worldwide. But its advisers were more productive, generating an average of $742,000 in annualized fees and commissions, up 8 percent from the third quarter. The division also seems to be attracting wealthier clients, with a 15 percent increase in assets from clients who have $10 million or more to invest. It now oversees $522 billion in assets from these clients, up 15 percent from a year ago. Overall, the division oversees $1.7 trillion of client assets, up 7 percent. The firm continued shrinking its branch network, closing 16 retail offices during the quarter. It now has 851 branches. Last week, Morgan Stanley reorganized the leadership of its retail brokerage unit, replacing Morgan Stanley Smith Barney President Charles Johnston with Greg Fleming, a former Merrill Lynch president who for the past year ran Morgan's asset management businesses.
