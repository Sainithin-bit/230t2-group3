 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Southwest Airlines Co ( LUV.N ) met Wall Street estimates for fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday on better passenger revenue, even as rising fuel costs boosted operating expenses. 

 The discount carrier said bookings for the current first quarter were strong. Its shares rose 0.8 percent as some other airline stocks moved lower. Morningstar analyst Basili Alukos said Southwest was probably increasing its domestic market share. "They are perceived as having the lowest fares," Alukos said, "and they haven't gone along and started to tack on as many a la carte or incremental fees as the legacy carriers." Southwest expects to acquire rival AirTran Holdings Inc AAI.N this year to expand in U.S. East Coast markets. The carrier also plans to add a larger Boeing Co ( BA.N ) plane to its fleet and is upgrading its reservation systems to pave the way to sell to international destinations. "Southwest has more opportunities for growth," said ITG Investment Research analyst Matthew Jacob. "But with those opportunities come uncertainty. Acquisitions always carry a lot of risk." Revenue and profit have improved at many U.S. airlines in the past year after the 2008-09 economic downturn curbed travel demand. Earlier this week, Delta Air Lines Inc ( DAL.N ) posted a fourth-quarter profit against a year-earlier loss, and American parent AMR Corp AMR.N delivered a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss. But spiking oil prices have renewed worries about the strength of the airline industry's recovery, and sector shares have sold off this week. The Arca Airline index  .XAL  was down 0.9 percent on Thursday. Southwest said it expected fuel costs of about $2.80 a gallon in the current quarter, up from $2.48 in the fourth quarter. "Except for fuel, we have a great outlook for 2011," Southwest CEO Gary Kelly said during a conference call. The company said its hedge program would help offset fuel price increases. Fourth-quarter net income rose to $131 million, or 18 cents a diluted share, from $116 million, or 16 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding a gain tied to fuel contracts, profit came to 15 cents a share, in line with the analysts' average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose nearly 15 percent to $3.11 billion. Passenger revenue gained 14 percent. Total expenses rose 14 percent as fuel and oil costs climbed 18 percent. Costs tied to maintenance and repairs were 20 percent higher. Southwest shares rose 11 cents to $12.94 on the New York Stock Exchange. Delta's stock was off 0.1 percent at $11.44, and AMR was down 2.2 percent at $7.52. Industry leader United Continental Holdings ( UAL.N ) slid 0.7 percent to $24.22.
