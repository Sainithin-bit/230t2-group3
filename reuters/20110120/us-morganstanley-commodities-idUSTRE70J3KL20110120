 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley's commodities risk fell in the fourth quarter as it faced trading woes similar to the rest of Wall Street, but the No. 2 U.S. investment bank still pipped top rival Goldman Sachs with a higher risk year-on-year. 

 Morgan Stanley's Value-at-Risk for commodities stood at $26 million in the fourth quarter, down almost 20 percent from the third quarter, like Goldman's. But compared with a year earlier, when its commodities VaR was at $23 million, the fourth quarter showed an improvement of 13 percent for Morgan Stanley. Goldman's commodities risk fell nearly 40 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2009. VaR in an industry measure for how much of a bank's money is at risk on a day for trading a particular asset class.
