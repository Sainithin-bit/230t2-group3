 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc ( DAL.N ) sued the Export-Import Bank of the United States on Wednesday, renewing a legal fight over subsidies that benefit aircraft exporters such as Boeing Co ( BA.N ) and by extension non-U.S. airlines. 
 The suit was filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. Joining Delta as plaintiffs were Hawaiian Airlines Inc and the Air Line Pilots Association, International. (Reporting by  David Ingram ; Editing by  Gary Hill )
