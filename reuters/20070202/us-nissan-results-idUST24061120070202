 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co. ( 7201.T ) reported a worse-than-expected 23 percent slide in quarterly net profit, blaming a sluggish recovery in U.S. sales, and forecast the first full-year earnings drop under turnaround king Carlos Ghosn. 


 The results and forecasts, worse than the market had expected, pushed shares of Renault SA ( RENA.PA ), which owns 44 percent of Nissan, down by as much as 4.2 percent. Sales slid around the world last year after Nissan raced to meet an ambitious sales target of 3.6 million vehicles in the 12 months to end-September 2005. Last year, the maker of the 350Z sports car and Versa subcompact was overtaken by Honda Motor Co. ( 7267.T ) as Japan's second-biggest carmaker as production plummeted amid a lack of new model launches. Ghosn, chief executive of both Nissan and Renault, had flagged a recovery during the October-March second half, but high gasoline prices and an escalating price war hit sales of Nissan's SUVs and other light trucks in the United States, curbing retail sales growth in the December quarter. "We feel bad about this decrease," Ghosn, who also faces a bumpy road to recovery at Renault, said of the financial figures. "This is not in the culture of Nissan, to miss something that has been forecast, particularly when it's relative to profit," he told reporters via video conference from Paris. "We're going to be very cautious when we give forecasts from now on." Tokyo-based Nissan cut its net profit forecast to 460 billion yen ($3.8 billion) for the fiscal year to end-March 2007 from a prior estimate of 523 billion, and its operating profit forecast by 12 percent to 775 billion. A survey of 19 brokerages by Reuters Estimates put net profit at 538 billion yen and operating profit at 854 billion yen, but those projections will almost certainly be lowered after Nissan's latest guidance. Conceding that Nissan could not blame its shortfalls entirely on adverse business conditions such as a weak overall U.S. market, Ghosn said the carmaker would draw up additional measures to help meet goals under its three-year plan. He said details would be unveiled in April. Ghosn stood by Nissan's commitments under the plan to pay dividends of 34 yen for 2006/07 and 40 yen for 2007/08 "whatever happens". October-December operating profit dipped 17 percent to 183.1 billion yen, the fourth quarterly drop in a row and below an average estimate of 218.7 billion in a survey of five brokers. Net profit fell to 104.5 billion yen, while revenue rose 1.8 percent to 2.34 trillion, aided by a 13-yen rise in the euro. GLOBAL SALES FORECAST ELUSIVE In light of disappointing sales in the United States as well as Japan, Nissan Corporate Vice President Joji Tagawa said the company was certain to miss its global sales target of 3.73 million units for this business year. To be sure, overall vehicle demand in the United States softened in 2006, with gas-guzzling light trucks taking the biggest hit. But most other Asian carmakers are making strides in the world's biggest car market at the expense of General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) and Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) while the U.S. companies restructure and axe tens of thousands of jobs amid shrinking sales and high legacy costs. On Wednesday, rival Honda posted a 5.2 percent rise in quarterly operating profit as a soft yen and brisk sales in the U.S., Europe and Asia made up for higher materials costs. Japan's top-ranked Toyota Motor Corp. ( 7203.T ) is expected to post a double-digit rise when it reports profits on Tuesday. "Nissan benefited from the impact of the currency," said Koichi Ogawa, chief portfolio manager at Daiwa SB Investments. "Had it not been for the weaker yen, the results would have been a lot worse." Nissan's Tagawa predicted the slow recovery would persist into the fourth quarter. Last month, robust passenger car sales lifted Nissan's U.S. sales by an adjusted 4.5 percent. But sales of light trucks slid 12 percent in what the company said was an indication that Nissan was refusing to get dragged too deep into the margin-eroding incentives game. Nissan plans to make up for lost ground with the global launch of 11 all-new models during the 2007/08 business year, on top of the strategically important Qashqai crossover and two other vehicles to be rolled out in the fourth quarter. Nissan shares rose 8.3 percent in October-December, lagging the transport sector subindex's .ITEQP.T 17.4 percent gain. Ahead of the results on Friday, Nissan closed down 1.8 percent at 1,509 yen.
