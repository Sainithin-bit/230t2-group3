 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Nearly 2,800 workers at Harley-Davidson Motor Co.'s ( HOG.N ) largest assembly plant began walking the picket lines early on Friday morning in the first work stoppage to hit the U.S. motorcycle maker in 16 years. 


 On Wednesday, workers at the York, Pennsylvania plant rejected the company's last, best and final offer for a new three-year contract by a vote of 2,514 to 98. The workers then authorized a strike when the current five-year contract expired shortly after midnight by a vote of 2,533 to 52. Harley had been seeking a variety of concessions from the workers, including a new two-tier wage-and-benefit plan. It said the concessions were necessary to help the company, which is currently enjoying growing sales and profit, avoid finding itself "in the same position that the Detroit auto industry is in now" 10 years down the road. On Thursday, Harley said it was immediately suspending production of the Touring and Softail motorcycles the York plant produces. Those models are among the company's most profitable. The stakes in a prolonged walkout are potentially high. In a note to investors on Thursday, Tim Conder, an analyst at A.G. Edwards & Sons, pointed out that the two models from the York plant are Harley's highest-margin products and account for about 60 percent of all the motorcycles it makes. Michael Savner, an analyst at Bank of America Equity Research, estimated a strike would cost the company roughly $11 million in sales, and about a penny per share of profit, every day the production shutdown lasts. But Conder said he was optimistic that the issues would be quickly resolved, citing Harley's "long history of extremely good company/labor relations." Harley, which faces similar contract expirations in Kansas City later this summer and Milwaukee early next year, hasn't experienced a work disruption since 1991. At that time the York workers, who make between 700 and 800 bikes a day, staged a walkout that was quickly resolved. Craig R. Kennison, an analyst at R.W. Baird, said he thought any strike this time would be similarly short-lived. Harley had planned for a short strike when it issued its first-quarter shipment guidance last month and shipments of the two bikes the plant makes during the fourth quarter left dealers with ample supply to satisfy demand during the off-season, Kennison said. "While a prolonged strike could do some harm to the brand, a short disruption would do little damage," Kennison wrote in a note to investors,
