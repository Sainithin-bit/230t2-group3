 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Equity Office Properties Trust said on Friday it still preferred a $54-per-share cash offer from private equity firm Blackstone Group, despite a higher cash-and-stock bid of $56 per share from Vornado Realty Trust. 


 Equity Office EOP.N, the largest U.S. office landlord, said it was recommending the $22.4 billion Blackstone deal because it believes it has "certainty of value and virtual certainty of closing in the immediate future." But Equity Office's biggest institutional shareholder, asset manager Cohen & Steers, still favors the roughly $23.2 billion Vornado ( VNO.N ) offer because it is higher and because of Vornado's track record in real estate. "The highest, risk-adjusted, bid wins as far as we are concerned," said Robert Steers, co-chief executive of Cohen & Steers. Some EOP shareholders, such as Cohen & Steers, are dedicated real estate investors whose funds are often designed to invest in publicly traded real estate securities. Analysts were unsure about the chances of an even higher offer from Vornado, but did not rule it out. Vornado declined to comment. "You'd have to have a bid that's just so good that even with all the risks, you can't ignore it," said Shawn Campbell, principal of Campbell Asset Management. On Friday, proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis said it supported Vornado's bid, chiefly because Blackstone's deal would deprive investors of a large amount of real estate investment opportunities. DELAY Equity Office said it was advised it could take four to six months to close the Vornado proposal because of the need for a Vornado shareholder vote and the potential for review by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In contrast, Blackstone's offer could close within a week. Equity Office said given the time delay in Vornado's proposal, it has been advised the net present value of that offer is between $54.28 and $54.88 per share, even after taking into account the receipt of dividends in the interim. "The approximately 1 percent higher net present value of the Vornado offer fails to adequately compensate Equity Office shareholders for the increased risk when compared to the Blackstone transaction," Equity Office said in a statement. In addition to the risks associated with time, Equity office would be on the hook for the $500 million break-up fee for terminating the Blackstone deal if shareholders of either Vornado or Equity Office balked at the Vornado deal, Equity Office said in a filing. Finally, Vornado has said it wanted to sell $20 billion within the first year of ownership of Equity Office, but a person familiar with the deal said it wants Equity Office to line up $10 billion in assets whose sale could be closed by the time the corporate buyout is completed. If sales are not going well, if interest rates rise and office prices change, or if the real estate market sags, Vornado shareholders could vote down the deal. "The biggest risk is the shareholder vote and (Vornado) can get out of this deal if the market changes," the person said. Over the past three years, Equity Office has been the most prolific seller of office buildings, but still has only been able to sell $8 billion worth, the person said. A special Equity Office shareholder meeting to vote on the Blackstone deal is technically scheduled to open Monday. But the company said it would immediately adjourn the meeting and give shareholders extra time to review additional proxy material. The vote is scheduled for on or about Wednesday. WAR Including debt, Blackstone's offer is valued at $38.3 billion, which would make it one of the biggest leveraged buyouts ever. Vornado's offer has a total value of $41 billion, including debt and "all potential transaction costs." Blackstone would receive a $500 million breakup fee if Equity Office terminated their agreement. The competing offers for Equity Office represent the largest-ever battle for a real estate investment trust and one that involves big personalities in the real estate and private equity industries. Equity Office was founded more than 30 years ago by real estate magnate Sam Zell. Vornado's offer pitched its chief executive, Steven Roth, up against Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman, whose private equity firm has played a central role in a wave of real estate deals. Equity Office won support from one governance expert in its preference for Blackstone. "We continue to recommend the Blackstone offer for a lot of the same reasons that we have seen from market analysts and from the board -- the risk factor," said Shirley Westcott, managing director of policy at shareholder advisory firm Proxy Governance.
