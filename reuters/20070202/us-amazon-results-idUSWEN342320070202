 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc. ( AMZN.O ) posted on Thursday a quarterly profit that fell 51 percent but still beat analysts' expectations, helped by healthy holiday sales of electronics. 


 Wall Street, encouraged by the online retailer's 34 percent rise in quarterly sales and a 2007 sales forecast that topped expectations, pushed its shares up as much as 6 percent shortly after the market close, but the stock later gave up the gains. Higher taxes and investment spending drove down Amazon's fourth-quarter net income to $98 million, or 23 cents per share, from $199 million, or 47 cents per share, a year earlier. Total sales rose to $3.99 billion, helped by a 55 percent rise in sales of less-profitable electronics. "You have to be a patient investor to own Amazon," said Stifel Nicolaus analyst Scott Devitt. "It is a very, very long-term business in terms of hitting a leverage point. Nobody knows when it's coming. Some don't believe it." The Seattle-based company, which has been expanding into categories such as digital downloads and groceries, has focused on revenue growth in recent years, betting that the success of new initiatives will boost profits in the long-term. "We're getting more share of wallet from customers," said Chief Financial Officer Tom Szkutak during a conference call with analysts. The results topped Wall Street consensus estimates of 21 cents per share of earnings on sales of $3.78 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Tax expense equaled 22 cents per share during the quarter, while a year ago Amazon received a tax benefit of 9 cents per share. Excluding a favorable impact from currency exchange rates, sales rose 30 percent. But concerns remained over how much it is costing the company to drive growth, with Global Crown Capital analyst Martin Pyykkonen calling the company's 2007 profit margin forecast "lackluster." Marketing costs rose in the quarter but a 34 percent rise in technology and content spending was below a 42 percent year-over-year rise in the third quarter. Increased sales of electronics, lower prices and discount shipping program Amazon Prime crimped profit margins, Szkutak said. Looking to 2007, Amazon gave full-year targets for operating earnings of between $355 million and $505 million on revenue of $13 billion to $13.7 billion. Analysts had been expecting revenue of $12.57 billion for the year, according to Reuters Estimates. For the first quarter, Amazon expects operating income of $82 million to $122 million and net sales of $2.85 billion to $3 billion. Analysts had been expecting sales of $2.77 billion. EXPENSIVE LOYALTY Over the holidays, Amazon tried to spur traffic to its site with promotions such as a limited supply of Microsoft's ( MSFT.O ) popular Xbox 360 Core Systems for $100 instead of its suggested $300 retail price. But heavy discounts, together with Amazon Prime, have come under attack as expensive ways to foster consumer loyalty. Asked about operating profit margins in 2007, Szkutak said newer categories that have been costly in the short term will begin to pay off. "These newer categories are becoming much more meaningful for us. Over time, we will be able to get those margins to be very solid within our business," Szkutak said. "When we get to scale on those particular categories, good things happen." Also on Thursday, Amazon opened pre-orders for the last installment of the popular "Harry Potter" book series. Last year, it had more than 1.5 million units pre-ordered and Amazon said that so far, pre-orders were well ahead of last year's. Amazon trades at 51 times estimated 2007 earnings, about three times that of many traditional retailers such as Wal-Mart ( WMT.N ) or Best Buy ( BBY.N ), and above eBay Inc. ( EBAY.O ) -- the No. 1 e-commerce Web site -- at 25 times. After the initial rise, Amazon stock rose to $38.82 in extended trade from a Nasdaq close of $38.70, up 2.7 percent.
