 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) lost more than a sixth of their combined U.S. sales in January, and Toyota Motor Corp. extended its 20-month winning streak and claimed the No. 2 spot in the U.S. market. 


 Ford's sales plunged 19 percent and GM lost 16 percent, as both U.S. automakers cut their reliance on low-margin sales to car rental agencies and closed a combined 28 factories. But Toyota's contrasting 10-percent gain in January sales underscored its momentum with a lineup of fuel-efficient cars and the pressure on the struggling U.S. auto industry to offer more aggressive discounts in the face of lackluster consumer demand, analysts said. Analysts said they expected industrywide sales to have dropped by 5 percent or more, reflecting less aggressive discounting, a weaker U.S. housing market and higher interest rates. "We've hit a point where the consumer is strained and I think we're in a position where the industry is going to downshift and stay there," said Global Insight analyst George Magliano. Other major automakers reported sales gains for January. DaimlerChrysler AG's U.S. sales were up 3 percent on an unadjusted basis, including a 1 percent gain for Chrysler Group. Nissan Motor Co. Ltd.'s sales rose 8.9 percent before adjusting for sales days. Honda Motor Co. Ltd. posted a 2.4 percent gain on the same basis. There were 25 sales days in January, one more than a year earlier. As a result, adjusted sales results were about 4 percentage points lower than the simple change in unit sales reported by the automakers. Overall, U.S. sales of cars and light-duty trucks came in at about 16.7 million units on an annualized and seasonally adjusted basis for the month, down from 17.5 million units a year earlier, according to Autodata Corp. Analysts had expected sales to slip to between 16.2 million and 16.9 million units. 'ON AN ISLAND' Toyota's sales rise reflected strong sales of its passenger cars, including the Camry sedan and luxury Lexus models, such as the ES 350 and the LS 460. "Toyota is the outlier in an industry that is a bit weak," said GM sales analyst Paul Ballew. "They sit out there on an island right now." GM and Ford attributed their sales declines to decisions they had previously announced to cut back on low-margin sales to car rental agencies and focus on more profitable sales to retail customers. But analysts said the underlying trend at showrooms also looked weak, raising the prospect of more aggressive incentive spending and even lower margins for an industry struggling with chronic overcapacity. Edmunds.com analyst Jesse Toprak estimated overall incentive spending dropped 6 percent to about $2.6 billion in January, but said the pricing pressure could intensify. "If you're an automaker, you can't roll out new product in the short term, so one of the only options you have is to step up incentives," he said. Chrysler's sales results were stronger than analysts had expected, but in contrast to Ford and GM it did not detail the share of its sales to fleet customers. The automaker, which is scheduled to announce a restructuring later this month, will cut first-quarter production by a "significant" margin, spokesman Jason Vines said. Chrysler, which led the industry in estimated incentive spending in January, on Thursday rolled out a new program of "value coupons" for dealers to offer buyers in addition to cash rebates on many of its models including the Dodge Charger and Magnum. GM also indicated that it would offer deeper discounts on some models this month and next. "We're going to maintain our competitiveness," Ballew said. "You'll see somewhat more aggressiveness ... but we're not going to go down the path in which we just throw incentive dollar after incentive dollar." Ford, which is racing to cut jobs and shutter plants as its market share declines, said its retail sales had declined by about 5 percent in the month. Sales of its market-leading F-series pickup trucks were down 15 percent. "We are focused on getting this business back to profitability, full stop," Ford's chief sales analyst George Pipas said. "Where we are in sales races and rankings or where people forecast we are going to be is a distraction we are not going to be bothered with."
