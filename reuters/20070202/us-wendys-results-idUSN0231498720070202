 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Wendy's International Inc. WEN.N reported a 90 percent drop in fourth-quarter net profit on Friday due to losses at the recently-sold Baja Fresh brand and costs for employee compensation and the burger chain's planned breakfast menu. 


 The company's shares fell more than 4 percent following the announcement as results came in well below analysts' estimates. Net income was $3 million, or 3 cents per share, compared with $30 million, or 25 cents per share, a year ago. Income from continuing operations, after taxes, was 9 cents per share. Excluding one-time charges and a tax benefit, Wendy's earned 6 cents a share, well below Wall Street's average estimate of 21 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Total revenue fell 1.1 percent to $596.4 million. Wendy's last month said sales at company-owned restaurants open at least 15 months, a key retail measure known as same-store sales, rose 3.1 percent in the fourth quarter, helped by demand for new Double Melt cheeseburgers. At franchised Wendy's restaurants, same-store sales rose 2.7 percent. Wendy's has relied on promotions like a 99-cent junior bacon cheeseburger and new products like the Double Melt cheeseburger to help it compete with bigger rivals McDonald's Corp. ( MCD.N ) and Burger King Holdings Inc. BKC.N. In the last year, the company has shed smaller brands like Tim Hortons and Baja Fresh Mexican Grill so it can concentrate on boosting performance at its flagship brand. The strategy has started to pay off. Same-store sales have improved in the past three quarters after posting a drop of 4.8 percent in the first quarter of last year. During the fourth quarter, Wendy's named interim Chief Executive Kerrii Anderson to that post permanently. Anderson had served as the company's chief financial officer and was named interim CEO after former chief Jack Schuessler resigned suddenly in April. Wendy's shares were down $1.49, or 4.4 percent, at $32.35 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
