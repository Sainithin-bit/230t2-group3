 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Traders were betting on Friday that 
U.S. employers added 182,800 jobs in January, according to the 
preliminary implied median market forecast of a derivatives 
auction. 


  The result was higher than the 161,400 jobs gain implied in 
the auction late Thursday and above the median forecast of 
economists in a Reuters poll that forecast a 149,000 gain in 
January.  U.S. payrolls grew by a 167,000 in December.  The U.S. Labor Department will issue the January non-farm 
payroll report at 8:30 a.m. (1330 GMT).  Friday's derivatives auction was the last of the five 
auctions on non-farm payrolls scheduled this week.  Investors use the auctions to hedge against surprises in 
the report, and traders also use the auctions to speculate on 
the outcome.  Economic derivatives are offered by Goldman Sachs, 
interdealer broker ICAP and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange 
CME.N.
