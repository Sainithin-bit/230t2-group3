 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Equity Office Properties Trust EOP.N said on Friday that its board of trustees has voted to reaffirm its support for a $54 per share takeover offer from private equity firm The Blackstone Group, despite a higher competing bid from Vornado Realty Trust. ( VNO.N ) 


 The board of EOP, the largest U.S. office landlord, said the $56 per share cash-and-stock offer from Vornado "fails to adequately compensate Equity Office shareholders for the increased risk when compared to the Blackstone transaction." The board said it has been advised that it would likely take about four to six months to close the Vornado deal because of the requirement for a Vornado shareholder vote and the potential for review by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Given this time delay, the board has been advised that the net present value of the Vornado offer is between $54.28 and $54.88 per share, even after taking into account the receipt of dividends in the interim, EOP said. In contrast Blackstone's all-cash offer, whose closing conditions have largely been satisfied, could close on or about February 9, EOP said. "The board of Equity Office believes that the Blackstone transaction has certainty of value and virtual certainty of closing in the immediate future," EOP said in a statement. EOP said it will file a proxy statement further describing the reasons for its conclusion on Friday, February 2. A special shareholder meeting to vote on the Blackstone deal remains scheduled for February5, EOP said. It added however that it expects the meeting will be immediately adjourned until February 7, in order to give shareholders sufficient time to review and consider the supplemental proxy materials. The vote would then be taken on February 7 and the deal would close on or about February 9, EOP said.
