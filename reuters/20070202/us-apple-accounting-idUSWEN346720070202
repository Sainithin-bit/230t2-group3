 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Apple Inc. ( AAPL.O ) reiterated in a regulatory filing on Friday that the U.S. government informally had requested information and documents on its past stock-options practices and said the issue was a distraction for management. 


 The company disclosed the same information in a filing with the SEC in December, when it said it would take an $84 million charge for misdating more than 6,400 stock options. Apple said in the quarterly filing on Friday that it received an informal request after it gave the results of an internal review of its stock options grants to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California. "Resolution of these matters will be time-consuming, expensive, and will distract management from the conduct of the company's business," Apple said in the filing. Apple, maker of the market-leading iPod digital music player and Macintosh computers, is among the best known of more than 160 companies under scrutiny for their accounting of stock options granted to executives. Investors have particularly focused on whether the scandal will hurt Chief Executive Steve Jobs, the driving force behind Apple's turnaround in recent years. Some twenty options-related lawsuits were filed in 2006 against companies such as Apple, UnitedHealth Group Inc. ( UNH.N ) and Juniper Networks JNPR.O over stock option grants. Cupertino, California-based Apple has said its internal review found two questionable options awarded to Jobs, but found no wrongdoing by current management, including Jobs. According to media reports, Jobs was questioned by federal investigators in San Francisco earlier in January. Apple shares were down 32 cents, less than 1 percent, at $84.42 in late Friday trade on Nasdaq. The stock had risen to a record $97.80 in January after Jobs unveiled its long-awaited iPhone, but have since retreated following Apple's lower-than-expected outlook for the current quarter.
