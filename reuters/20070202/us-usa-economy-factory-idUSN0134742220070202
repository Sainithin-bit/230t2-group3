 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - New orders at U.S. factories rose 2.4 percent in December, higher than forecast, while inventories edged up, a government report showed on Friday. 


 Analysts polled by Reuters had expected factory orders to gain 1.8 percent after November's revised 1.2 percent rise, originally reported as a 0.9 percent gain.
