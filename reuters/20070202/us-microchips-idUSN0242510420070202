 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Global sales of microchips are expected to rise about 10 percent to $273.8 billion this year after increasing 8.9 percent to $247.7 billion in 2006, an industry group said on Friday. 


 Sales in December were $21.7 billion, a 9 percent increase from December 2005 and a 3.6 percent decline from $22.5 billion in November 2006, the Semiconductor Industry Association said. Fourth-quarter sales were $65.2 billion, up 9 percent from a year earlier and up 1.9 percent from the third quarter. Sales have benefited from the spread of microchips into a broad array of consumer gadgets, such as mobile phones, digital music players and high-definition television sets, and a booming market for memory chips. "2006 was the year of the consumer in the electronic industry," SIA President George Scalise said in a statement. Major chipmakers include PC processor giant Intel Corp. ( INTC.O ), memory chip leader Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. ( 005930.KS ) of South Korea, and Texas Instruments Inc. TXN.N, the biggest supplier of cell phone processors. Over the past year, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange's semiconductor index .SOXX has fallen 13 percent, compared with a rise of 13 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500 index  .SPX .
