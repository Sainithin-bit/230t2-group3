 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Gannett Co. Inc. ( GCI.N ) posted a better-than-expected 3 percent rise in quarterly profit on Friday, boosted by higher advertising demand at its newspapers and a rise in political ad sales at its TV stations. 


 Gannett, the largest U.S. newspaper company and owner of USA Today, is the second major publisher this week to post results that were ahead of forecasts on Wall Street. Its share price rose more than 2 percent by midday, suggesting some relief among investors who have seen the newspaper industry consistently hammered by advertising and circulation declines. Both Gannett's newspaper and broadcasting revenue rose in the quarter. But like the New York Times Co. ( NYT.N ), which reported quarterly results on Wednesday, Gannett benefited from an additional week in the 2006 quarter. Tribune Co. TRB.N and McClatchy Co. ( MNI.N ) will report earnings next week. Overall, Gannett's fourth-quarter profit rose to $353.5 million, or $1.51 per share, from $343.3 million, or $1.44 per share, in the year-earlier period. Revenue rose 7.5 percent to $2.2 billion. Wall Street expected a profit per share of $1.49 and revenue of $2.15 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Morgan Stanley analyst Lisa Monaco cautioned that newspaper publishers are not clear of broader troubles in the business. "Some investors may find the fact that Gannett is showing some growth in newspaper ad revenue (albeit modest) a positive, but we don't find anything in these numbers that gets us excited about newspaper industry trends or Gannett," Monaco said in a research report. "Newspaper ad revenue was as expected but circulation, other, and broadcasting revenues were above our estimates," she said, adding: "Part of the revenue upside could be because the extra week had a greater-than-expected impact." Indeed, advertising demand in its newspaper and broadcasting divisions were both higher in the quarter, the company said. Newspaper group revenue rose 5 percent to $1.94 billion. Ad sales rose 3.7 percent to $1.45 billion in the division, lifted by local and national ad sales. But Gannett said higher newsprint costs and other expenses pushed quarterly operating profit at the newspaper group down 4.5 percent to $472.6 million. Broadcasting division revenue rose 30.3 percent to $270.6 million, boosted by political ad spending. Gannett said "substantially higher online revenue" also contributed to the growth, but did not break out results. Broadcasting operating profit rose 35 percent to $135.2 million in the quarter. Gannett shares were up $1.31 to $59.25 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange. (Additional reporting by  Kenneth Li )
