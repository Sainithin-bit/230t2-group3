 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve officials, who are debating whether to adopt an explicit target for inflation, have discussed whether an implicit, or "soft" target, might be preferable, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday. 


 The debate reflects Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke's belief that the central bank needs to develop a clearer, more systematic way of communicating its intentions, the Journal said. At Bernanke's behest, the Fed's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee is studying possible changes in how it communicates its forecasts, statements and meeting minutes, the Journal reported. Fed officials say one form of implicit targeting would be to extend the horizon of the Fed's economic forecasts beyond two years, with the inflation forecast for the last year of the period representing the Fed's implicit target, the Journal reported. Another would be to poll all 19 FOMC members on their personal definition of price stability and publish the resulting range, rather than forcing them to agree on a single number or range, the paper said. Currently, the Fed's official aim is to achieve price stability, but it doesn't specify what rate or range of inflation it thinks would fulfill that goal, the paper said.
