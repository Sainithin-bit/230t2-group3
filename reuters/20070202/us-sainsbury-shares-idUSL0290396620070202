 LONDON  (Reuters) - Private equity firms CVC CVC.UL, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts KKR.UL and Blackstone BG.UL said they were in the early stages of assessing a bid for British supermarket group J Sainsbury, driving its shares to an 8-year high. 


 Shares in Britain's third-biggest supermarket owner leapt as much as 18 percent to 526-1/2 pence, valuing the business at as much as 9.7 billion pounds ($19.1 billion). "No decision has been made regarding the relative merits of an offer and as a consequence there can be no assurance that any offer for Sainsbury will be forthcoming," the private equity firms said in a joint statement. Sainsbury ( SBRY.L ) declined to comment. Shares in rival Tesco ( TSCO.L ) and WM Morrison Supermarkets ( MRW.L ) also rose sharply as investors re-evaluated the sector and some analysts speculated the bid momentum could flow to other companies. Numis analyst Steve Davies, who earlier this week forecast a bid approach for Sainsbury, said he believed a financial buyer prepared to arrange a full sale and leaseback on Sainsbury's properties could afford to pay 600 pence per share. He conservatively valued Sainsbury property at 7.5 billion pounds ($14.8 billion). "You have to be careful as this may not necessarily turn into a bid, but if it does I'd expect Sainsbury to stage a robust defense," Davies said. By 1240 GMT, 182 million Sainsbury shares had traded hands compared with an average daily volume of 12.8 million during the past 30 days. The stock traded up 15.1 percent at 512-1/2 pence. Tesco was up 4 percent and Morrison up 7.2 percent, outperforming a 3 percent rise in the DJ Stoxx index of European retailers .SXRP. Analysts speculated any Sainsbury offer could raise bid interest among UK non-food retailers with Home Retail Group ( HOME.L ) and Kesa KESA.L seen as the most likely targets. "The market at the moment seems in need of a catalyst to lift it to the next level. Such high profile bid speculation could provide such a jolt," Richard Hunter, head of UK Equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers wrote in a note. TARGET Sainsbury, in the throes of a restructuring under Chief Executive Justin King, has long been tipped as a potential target for private equity firms with any deal expected to be financed in part by selling and leasing back its stores. "We would not rule out a bid materializing, particularly as the property angle comes into play," credit analysts at Royal Bank of Scotland said in a note to clients, although they noted around half of the grocer's over 7 billion pounds of property assets were already pledged under securitisations. The takeover talk was given a new boost on Thursday when the company disclosed the Sainsbury family trust had sold 40 million shares, cutting its stake to 238 million shares, or 13.9 percent. The family holding has often been cited as a potential obstacle to a takeover. The Sainsbury family's lawyer was not immediately available for comment and analysts said it was not clear whether the sale was coincidental or a signal they backed a bid. However, some analysts remained skeptical about the chances of an offer resulting from the private equity interest, particularly with signs King's turnaround of the group is stalling after January earnings showed slowing profit growth. "Our view remains that any offer based on a sale and leaseback of the property portfolio is unlikely, as it would lumber the purchaser with a large retail bill," Seymour Pierce analyst Richard Ratner said in a note in which he cut Sainsbury to "sell" from "underperform". Sainsbury credit default swaps widened by 25 basis points to 55 basis points on confirmation of the private equity interest. The supermarket chain, whose share price has risen nearly 50 percent in the past year on its turnaround plans, trades at 32 times forward earnings compared with 19 times for Britain's biggest retailer Tesco and 17 times for the DJ Stoxx index of European retailers.
