 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A new investor lawsuit against Dell Inc. accuses the computer maker of improperly accounting for hundreds of millions of dollars in payments from long-time partner Intel Corp., a plaintiffs' attorney said on Friday. 


 The lawsuit accuses Dell of artificially inflating profits "by secretly receiving approximately $250 million a quarter in likely illegal rebate kickbacks payments" from Intel in return for an exclusive deal to purchase Intel's microprocessors, class-action lawyer William Lerach told Reuters. Intel denied the accusations and said that some of the claims appear to "rehash" similar complaints against the chip maker by smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc.. A Dell spokesman would not comment on the lawsuit. "We deny the plaintiffs' allegations and plan to move quickly to defend ourselves," said Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy. Dell has for years used Intel microprocessors in all of its computers but began buying processors from AMD last year. Analysts said it is widely known that Intel pays marketing fees to industry partners like Dell that feature its logo on computers and in advertising. Dell does not break out such payments, known as "reimbursements," in its financial statements. While the legality of such payments is unclear, analysts say they should be clearly marked by both parties. "The numbers of more than a $1 billion (annually) of what I would call marketing incentives (paid by Intel to Dell) is probably right on track," said ThinkEquity Partners analyst Eric Ross. "They don't disclose that at all, either of them, so it's hard to really dig it out." The lawsuit adds to legal risks at Dell, which is contending with a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into its accounting. The U.S. Justice Department is also reviewing the company's accounting. BRILLIANT MODEL? On Wednesday, the company replaced Chief Executive Kevin Rollins with founder and Chairman Michael Dell, who had been CEO until 2004. The change comes as the No. 2 personal computer maker struggles with missteps in the U.S. consumer market and market share losses to Hewlett-Packard Co.. If more light is shed on the marketing practices employed by Intel and its partners, Intel will likely have a harder time "buying their way in" to supply deals, said Ross. At the same time, Dell and others might be required to clearly state the sums received from Intel, a move that could uncover weaker operating profits, he said. "The low cost advantage and high margins that Dell was enjoying ... may not be the brilliance of the direct (marketing) model," said Ross. "It may have been the brilliance of having a single supplier that pays you." AMD had accused Intel of building up a dominant market share for some computer chips through anti-competitive conduct, including offering secret rebates. The plaintiffs in the Dell case also contend the company and its executives participated in a "widespread, long-running scheme to defraud" shareholders and inflate Dell's stock price, said Lerach, head of law firm Lerach Coughlin Stoia Geller Rudman & Robbins LLP in San Diego. The suit was filed on Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Austin, Texas, by the union-backed Amalgamated Bank's LongView Funds and the UK-based West Midlands Pension Fund, Lerach said. It seeks class-action status on behalf of other investors. Other defendants in the suit include Intel and Dell's accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers, and executives including Dell Chairman and Chief Executive Michael Dell and former CEO Rollins. A PricewaterhouseCoopers spokesman declined to comment. Shares of Dell slipped 9 cents to $23.71 on the Nasdaq. Intel stock was up 5 cents at $21.16.
