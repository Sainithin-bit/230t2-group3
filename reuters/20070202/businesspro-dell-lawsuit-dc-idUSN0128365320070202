 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Dell Inc. DELL.O is facing an 
investor lawsuit alleging that it improperly accounted for 
hundreds of millions of dollars in payments from its long-time 
partner Intel Corp. ( INTC.O ), the Wall Street Journal reported 
on its Web site on Friday. 


  In a lawsuit filed Wednesday by class-action lawyer William 
Lerach, plaintiffs allege that the computer giant was receiving 
as much as $1 billion a year in "secret and likely illegal" 
kickbacks from Intel to ensure that Dell used no other 
chipmaker, the Journal said.  The suit was filed in the U.S. District Court in Austin, 
Texas, it said. Officials at the law firm and at Dell could not 
immediately be reached for comment.  Dell on Wednesday named founder Michael Dell as chief 
executive, replacing Kevin Rollins as the No. 2 computer maker 
struggles with missteps in the U.S. consumer market and market 
share losses to Hewlett-Packard Co. ( HPQ.N ).
