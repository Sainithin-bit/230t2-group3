 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc. ( GS.N ), top banker to blue-chip companies, sees big opportunities in smaller deals. 


 Seeking ways to boost banking fees after hitting record levels last year, Goldman intends to do more deals with "middle market" companies, ranging from $500 million to $2 billion in market value. These companies together comprise the bulk of the U.S. economy and a lucrative source of new business. The middle market is "an area historically we do not cover very well," said Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein during a Merrill Lynch investor conference in November. He said middle-market deals will be a top priority. Most of Wall Street's top-tier banks have launched middle-market efforts during previous merger-and-acquisition booms, only to retreat when the fees were too small or when deal activity dried up. Blankfein said Goldman will make small deals pay off by advising, financing and investing its own capital with clients. The triple-play strategy has helped it to reap record gains and fees from some of the biggest deals of recent years. "Being an adviser, financier and co-investor allows us to realize opportunities that did not exist when banking was a pure advisory business," Blankfein said. Goldman's effort will follow moves by Citigroup ( C.N ), Merrill Lynch & Co. Inc. MER.N and Bank of America Corp. ( BAC.N ) in recent years to tap into that market. Leveraged buyout firms like Texas Pacific Group also are turning their attention to a sector that is bustling, boasts higher margins and has room to grow. There were about 1,200 deals worth between $50 million and $500 million last year, according to Mergerstat, with total value up 14 percent to about $200 billion. Overall M&A activity reached a record last year, but mid-market deals are still short of the 1,400 booked in 2000. "That's why you're seeing more and more of the New York firms opening up mid-market practices," Mark Brady, head of M&A at Chicago bank William Blair & Co., told Reuters. Goldman's entrance could be bad news for mid-market specialists, such as Jefferies Group Inc. JEF.N, Piper Jaffray Cos. ( PJC.N ) and Houlihan Lokey Howard & Zukin, which have benefited in the absence of the top-tier banks. SEEKING MARQUEE NAMES Some boards will choose a big bank's marquee name and the capital they can provide. But scale doesn't always guarantee success, bankers and analysts agree. Middle-market chief executives, they added, want top-shelf service -- something that giant banks may be reluctant to provide when the fees are middling. "If you're the CEO of a $300 million company, you have to be asking yourself, 'How important am I to them?'" Brady said. And big banks like Goldman aren't geared to trading stocks or providing research and banking services to middle-sized companies, Jefferies CEO Richard Handler said in an interview. "(Goldman is) an unbelievable powerhouse of a firm, but it's a very different business," Handler said. "It's one thing to say you want to come into this market, but you also need quality research. You have to traffic in those stocks and have senior bankers committed to these companies." Ultimately, according to mid-market bankers, big firms find it hard to keep focused on lower-fee deals. Goldman's average deal size last year was $2.9 billion, according to Dealogic, versus roughly $200 million in the middle market. "If you don't follow companies in that space, you can't credibly say you're a middle-market player," Piper investment banking head Jon Salveson said. "It's really hard to be pulled in both directions, to be primary coverage person for a global company, and at the same time pitch your best advice to a client with $30 million in revenue." UBS analyst Glenn Schorr expects Goldman to make inroads, over time becoming among the top five banks in this area. "One of the very few areas where Goldman has slipped is in their lack of penetration in the middle markets," Schorr said. "But there is no secret sauce. They need to focus more and find the low-hanging fruit. And they will." (Additional reporting by  James Kelleher  in Chicago)
