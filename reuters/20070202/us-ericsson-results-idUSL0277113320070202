 STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - Ericsson ( ERICb.ST ), the world's largest supplier of equipment for mobile phone networks, reported fourth-quarter pre-tax earnings below expectations on Friday and reduced its 2007 market growth forecast. 


 The lowering in guidance for 2007 was in line with the expectation of sector analysts of a tough year ahead. Ericsson shares slid and were off 5.7 percent at 25.8 crowns by 1000 GMT, its biggest one-day decline for around eight months. However, Ericsson chief executive Carl-Henric Svanberg said he remained upbeat and that the lowered guidance was more to do with a weaker-than-expected performance by rivals. He stressed the forecast was for the market, not his own company. "We are gaining market share actually faster than we had thought. We also see that weaker players are losing market share faster than thought," he told a news conference. Ericsson has powered ahead since having to halve its staff and nearing collapse after the end of the IT boom, but doubts have arisen about growth in the telecoms systems sector. Competition has also intensified given the entry of rivals like ZTE ( 000063.SZ ) and Huawei HWT.UL of China. At the same time, Ericsson has said it can benefit as its rivals are busy managing complicated mergers. Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ) is merging its networks business with that of Siemens ( SIEGn.DE ) while Alcatel and Lucent have also joined up to become Alcatel-Lucent ALU.PA. The difficulty of managing such processes became clear last week when Alcatel-Lucent warned that uncertainty created by its merger would hurt sales and profits in the fourth quarter. Ericsson's fourth-quarter pretax profit was 12.2 billion crowns ($1.76 billion), under the average forecast in a Reuters poll of 32 analysts of 12.51 billion crowns, but up from 10.1 billion in the same period of 2005. It was in the range of forecast of 11.2-14.2 billion. For 2006, pretax profit rose to 36 billion crowns from 33 billion in 2005. Ericsson got a boost from a strong performance by mobile phone maker Sony Ericsson, whose fourth-quarter earnings reached a record and which has become number global handset maker. Ericsson owns the venture with Japan's Sony Corp ( 6758.T ). FIVE PERCENT GROWTH Svanberg estimated that growth in the markets for systems for the key GSM/WCDMA mobile phone technologies had been 5 percent in 2006 and expected the same rate this year. This was lower than the moderate growth forecast the company had previously, implying 5 to 9 percent expansion. The group reported a gross margin of 41.8 percent versus 42.6 percent in the Reuters poll and an operating margin of 22.7 percent compared with a forecast 23 percent. One area of growth many firms in the sector are eyeing is China, with hopes resting on high-speed 3G. However, the authorities have long delayed issuing 3G licences to operators. Svanberg said he expected none to be issued this year, a surprise statement given that in December as Chinese official was quoted as saying the government might issue licences soon. Ericsson's cash position and prospects for enhanced payouts has been a theme among some sector analysts of late. Quarterly cash flow of 8.9 billion crowns meant the company did not live up to its ambition of about 12 billion, though it beat the 6.6 billion expected in the Reuters poll. It left the company with net cash of 40 billion crowns at the end of 2006. He said dividend policy so far was consistent with earlier payouts that equaled 30 percent of net income.
