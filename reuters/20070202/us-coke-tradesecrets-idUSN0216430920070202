 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - A U.S. jury on Friday found a former Coca-Cola Co. ( KO.N ) executive assistant guilty of conspiring to steal trade secrets of the beverage giant and trying to sell them to rival PepsiCo Inc. ( PEP.N ) for as much as $1.5 million. 


 Joya Williams, a former assistant to the director of global brands at Coca-Cola, could face up to 10 years in prison when she is sentenced. Williams, 41, showed no emotion as the verdict was read. "She's holding her own," according to her lawyer, Janice Singer, who said that she planned to appeal. "She seems pretty strong." Williams took the stand in her own defense and testified that although she routinely copied and took home work documents, she had no part in the plan to steal and sell sensitive data of her former employer to Pepsi. Instead, Williams said she was deceived by Ibrahim Dimson of New York and Edmund Duhaney of Decatur, Georgia -- her two co-defendants, who pleaded guilty in October. Duhaney testified that Williams, a family friend, initiated the plan and provided confidential Coke documents and samples of unreleased products. Duhaney said Williams was to have received $150,000 if Pepsi paid for the confidential information. The jury of seven women and five men began deliberating on Wednesday and took about 12 hours to reach a verdict. On Thursday, the panel sent a note saying it was deadlocked, but U.S. Judge J. Owen Forrester urged jurors to think over their positions and resume discussions on Friday. Lawyers in the case, who spoke with jurors privately after the verdict, said the playback of taped phone recordings between Williams' two co-defendants helped resolve the deadlock. Most of the jurors declined to talk with reporters, but one said, "I think there were some issues with how (Williams) represented herself" as he left federal court. UNDERCOVER STING The trial, which began last week, included testimony from Williams' former boss at Coca-Cola, her ex-boyfriend and an FBI agent who took part in an undercover sting that eventually led to the arrests of the three co-defendants. During the trial, prosecutors introduced surveillance video showing Williams packing documents into a bag at her Coca-Cola office and phone records showing calls made from Dimson's number to Williams' number shortly after Dimson had spoken with the undercover agent, who posed as a third party on behalf of Pepsi expressing interest in Coca-Cola documents. Prosecutors also attacked Williams' credibility by calling to the stand a Georgia businessman who said he was not the source of a $4,000 deposit that the government said Williams was paid by one of the co-defendants in the conspiracy. Williams had testified that the business owner loaned her the money. "This defendant misused her unique access as an employee to Coke's trade secrets and other proprietary information for personal profit," said David Nahmias, the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Georgia. The scheme came to light when PepsiCo, based in Purchase, New York, provided a copy of a letter to Coca-Cola in May 2006 from a person claiming to be a high-level employee offering product samples and other confidential information, prosecutors said. Atlanta-based Coke then contacted the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, which began an undercover inquiry. Coca-Cola "will continue to take all necessary measures to rigorously safeguard our intellectual capital," company spokeswoman Crystal Warwell Walker said in a statement after the verdict was published.
