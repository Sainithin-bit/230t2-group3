 STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - Truck maker Volvo ( VOLVb.ST ) posted quarterly pretax earnings that were lower than analysts had expected on Friday, but an extraordinary dividend and surprisingly strong orders in Europe lifted its shares. 


 Volvo, the world's second largest truck maker, said it would pay 50 crowns per share in dividends, doling out some of the cash activist shareholders have been pressing for, and raised its outlook for its key European truck market. Shares in the firm rose 2.0 percent to 521 crowns by 1040 GMT, outperforming the Stockholm bourse's blue chip OMXS30 index  .OMXS30  which was down 0.3 percent. Volvo reported fourth-quarter pretax earnings of 5.23 billion crowns ($753.2 million) versus a year-ago 4.14 billion and the mean forecast of 5.57 billion seen in a Reuters poll. "The main impression is that it is positive that they pay out an extraordinary dividend. It is also incredibly positive that the order intake in Europe is up as much as it is," Kaupthing analyst John Hernander said. Orders in Europe in the fourth quarter climbed 58 percent. Volvo said it planned to pay an ordinary dividend of 25 crowns per share, up from 16.75 crowns a year ago and above the 18.31 crowns seen by analysts. It will also pay an extraordinary dividend of 25 crowns per share in a share split and redemption. Eight analysts in the poll who had expected the extra payout the level at 38 crowns per share on average. NEW EUROPE? Truck makers have benefited from bulging order books on both sides of the Atlantic in recent years. Demand in the United States during the end of 2006 was exaggerated by customers pushing forward purchases ahead of new emission rules, implemented at the turn of the year. Truck makers and analysts are now forecasting a sharp drop in sales in the U.S. this year. Revenues at Volvo, which sells trucks, buses, construction equipment and a broad range of engines, dipped slightly to 65.07 billion crowns from 65.29 billion a year ago, undershooting the poll's mean forecast of 66.68 billion. But Volvo raised its forecast of the European heavy-duty truck market this year to about 300,000 units versus a previous outlook of a largely flat market of around 290,000 units. "In Europe, we are calling it at 300,000, but if you really would take a look at our order intake we would probably put a plus mark after that. But it's early in the year here," Volvo Chief Executive Leif Johansson told a news conference. Johansson said that the European truck market, where the firm was now working to raise capacity, was seeing a structural change with the growth in the new EU states and further east acting as a catalyst. "What we really have is a change in the whole of the set-up of Europe," Johansson said. Volvo said order bookings of heavy trucks, which it sells under the Renault and Mack brands as well as its own name, rose 8 percent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, despite falling 60 percent in North America. The firm did not make a specific forecast of the North American market, repeating that it expected it to decline sharply during the first half of 2007 while the last six months remained difficult to judge. Johansson said he still expected the North American market to recover in the second half of the year.
