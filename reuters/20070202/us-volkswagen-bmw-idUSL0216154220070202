 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - German mass carmaker Volkswagen ( VOWG.DE ) improved January VW brand sales in the United States by 2.3 percent to 16,610 vehicles thanks to rising demand for the Passat estate and the Golf GTI models, the company said late on Thursday. 


 Luxury brand BMW ( BMWG.DE ), which makes roughly a third of the cars globally that VW does per year, continued to outsell its larger mass market peer in the United States with 19,761 vehicles delivered last month -- a rise of 2.1 percent. Including the 30 percent monthly decline at its Mini brand, where demand cools as the next generation first hits showrooms the middle of this month, BMW group sales fell 1.8 percent to 21,811 units in January in the United States.
