 LONDON  (Reuters) - British Airways BAY.L expects to announce a major plane order by late summer, Chief Executive Willie Walsh said on Friday. 


 He told reporters on a conference call that the order, which is expected to replace more than 30 of BA's older Boeing Co. ( BA.N ) 747 and 767 models, should be decided by "mid- to late summer". Boeing and Airbus ( EAD.PA ) are bidding for the order, which will follow a smaller deal for planes which the airline is expected to announce. Walsh also noted the airline was close to finalizing the sale of its BA Connect regional business to Flybe and expected completion in March. With fuel a key factor in costs at BA, Chief Financial Officer Keith Williams told reporters on the call that the company expected fuel costs to rise 5 to 10 percent in the quarter to end-March.
