 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - While scientists debated Pluto's fate last summer, Fisher-Price executives were forced into a debate of their own: What would become of their Planet Heroes action figures if Pluto lost its planet status? 


 Fisher-Price had spent months creating Planet Heroes, a line of action figures aimed at 3- to 5-year-olds. The line was designed with characters representing the nine planets -- including "Shiver" for Pluto. In August, astronomers from around the world headed to Prague to discuss whether Pluto measured up to its other interstellar planetary colleagues. Fisher-Price held meetings of its own to try to devise a strategy for Pluto. "We were nervous," said Ben Jamesson, senior marketing manager for Fisher-Price boys, in an interview. "We wanted to be true to the solar system." In a stroke of luck for the toy maker, scientists only demoted Pluto to "dwarf planet" status, and the Fisher-Price team positioned Shiver as an underdog -- the smallest of the Planet Heroes, zooming around in a large snowmobile to compensate for being rather small in stature. "Everybody loves an underdog," Jamesson said. FROM RESCUE HEROES TO PLANET HEROES Fisher-Price and parent company Mattel Inc. MAT.N are getting ready to unveil the Planet Heroes line as toy makers descend on New York City late next week for the American International Toy Fair, where they will show off their latest products for 2007. Toy makers are struggling to revive sales as children are increasingly drawn to electronic gadgets like digital music players and video game consoles at younger ages. That has intensified competition among toy makers to develop toys that appeal to children 7 and under since they accounted for 62 percent of total U.S. toy sales in 2005, according to market research firm NPD Group. Fisher-Price is hoping Shiver and the rest of the Planet Heroes will strike a note with preschoolers and their mothers the same way its Rescue Heroes did when it was launched. In 1998, Fisher-Price introduced Rescue Heroes, marking the first foray into the preschool action-figure arena. With the motto "cool guys who are good guys," the toys featured characters who used their skills in positive way. In the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, attacks in New York, Rescue Heroes figures like the Billy Blazes firefighter character surged in popularity. But in the past few years, sales of Rescue Heroes started to wane, and Fisher-Price began looking for a new concept that could be understood easily by preschoolers worldwide. The team honed in on making characters based on the planets. "We don't have to explain to everybody that there are planets," said Tyler Berkheiser, lead designer of the Fisher-Price boys line. "It started to click." The Planet Heroes each have special talents linked to their planet. For instance, "Zip" travels at incredible speed since he represents Mercury, the planet that travels around the sun the fastest. Planet Heroes fared well in tests with mothers because they offer "soft learning," said Shehnaz Safiuddin, director of marketing at Fisher-Price. While the line is not positioned as educational, children will learn about the planets by playing with the toys, she said. Each hero comes with a card that lists facts about the planet that the character represents. Fisher-Price is positioning Planet Heroes as more than just an action-figure toy line. It is also releasing a DVD that tells the story of the origin of Planet Heroes, and it plans to develop more DVD episodes. Some of the toys, which will hit stores in the fall, will also come with a Planet Heroes comic book, and Fisher-Price is setting up a Web site that will tell more about the characters and show a trailer for the DVD episode. "We're really trying to make it a property," Jamesson said.
