 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - NYSE Group Inc. NYX.N posted a fourth-quarter profit on Friday, reversing a year-earlier loss, but results were not as strong as some investors had hoped, and its shares fell. 


 NYSE, which owns the New York Stock Exchange, earned $45.5 million, or 29 cents per share, compared with a loss of $20.3 million, or 18 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, earnings were 45 cents per share, a penny short of the average forecast of analysts polled by Reuters Estimates. "The quarter was a little weaker than we had thought and seemed to lack incremental positives," said Fox-Pitt, Kelton analyst Ed Ditmire. He said the results may have a muted effect as investors focus on what the NYSE will look like once it completes a merger with Euronext ENXT.PA, which operates the Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam and Lisbon bourses. "This quarter, sandwiched between <the Archipelago and Euronext> mergers, was a little disappointing," Ditmire said. The 2005 fourth-quarter results were hit by one-time expenses related to NYSE's acquisition of electronic trader Archipelago. NYSE shares were down $1.05, or 1 percent, at $100.64 in afternoon trading. They fell as low as $97.06 in morning dealings. Fourth-quarter revenue rose to $658.5 million from $425.5 million a year earlier. Excluding activity fees, revenue was $477.7 million, compared with analysts' average forecast of  $461.2 Analysts said revenue was hurt by a new pricing schedule that does not charge legacy NYSE customers for routing to other market centers. They also said expenses were higher than expected in several areas, including marketing costs. NEW LISTINGS UP, LISTED VOLUME SHARE DOWN New listings on the Big Board were up for the quarter, including 28 transfers from other markets, up from 16 a year earlier, and 29 non-U.S. company listings, up from 19 a year earlier. But during the quarter, the Big Board handled 70 percent of trading for its listed securities, down from 72 percent in the third quarter and 79 percent in the 2005 fourth quarter. "The trading business for NYSE performed only OK this quarter due to tremendous competitive pressure," Celent LLC analyst David Easthope wrote in a note to clients. Last month the NYSE completed a phase of its hybrid market platform, which adds electronic trading capabilities at the top U.S. stock exchange and is designed to make the Big Board compliant with Regulation NMS, a series of sweeping changes that update U.S. markets for new, rapid trading technologies. "With Reg NMS a reality in the next few months, NYSE will be under the microscope to prove its hybrid structure can be competitive with other trading venues," wrote Easthope.
