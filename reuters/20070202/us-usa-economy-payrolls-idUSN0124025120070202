 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. economy added a modest 111,000 jobs in January, but the job picture was much brighter than first estimated in the final quarter of last year, a government report showed on Friday. 


 While the January jobs gain fell short of economists' forecasts, upward revisions to prior months' data indicated the economy was on solid ground. A separate report found consumers -- whose spending fuels two-thirds of economic growth -- were more upbeat in January than they have been in two years. "I think what we're seeing is confirmation that the economy in the fourth quarter was very strong. We do know that it's slowing a bit in the first quarter, but not enough to cause concern," said Marc Pado, U.S. market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in San Francisco. Most of last month's hiring was in the service sector, which added 104,000 jobs. Factories posted their seventh straight monthly loss, partly reflecting auto-sector weakness, the Labor Department said. Construction firms added 22,000 workers in January as unseasonably warm weather spurred building activity. U.S. government bond prices inched higher and the dollar rose after the data, which left traders believing the Federal Reserve would keep interest rates steady well into this year. U.S. stocks were mixed with the Dow Jones Industrial Average  .DJI  ending down 20.19 points and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  up 2.45 points. Analysts said the jobs data suggested the economy was moving ahead at reasonable clip, but it was not at risk of overheating. "The number in January looks like the economy is beginning to behave the way that people expected it to, it is beginning to decelerate," said Mark Vitner, Senior Economist at Wachovia Securities in Charlotte. "This report makes it look like we are going to have six more months of soft landing." The Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers said its final index on consumer sentiment in January rose to 96.9 from 91.7 in December. The January reading was the highest since December 2004. The survey found consumers upbeat on the potential for wage gains, but still concerned about inflation, despite a big drop in gasoline prices. Wall Street analysts polled before the employment report expected the report to show 149,000 jobs were added outside the farm sector last month. They had also expected the unemployment rate to hold steady at 4.5 percent, but it edged up to 4.6 percent in one of the report's weak spots. 2006 JOBS PICTURE BETTER The report showed the employment picture for the last three months of 2006 was better than first thought, with the payroll count for the final three months of last year revised up by a total of 104,000 jobs. That helped round out a picture of year-end strength. The government had said on Wednesday that the economy grew at a solid 3.5 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter. Separate data from the Commerce Department on Friday also pointed to a strong 2006 finish, as new orders at U.S. factories rose a larger-than-expected 2.4 percent in December. Non-defense capital goods orders, excluding volatile aircraft, increased 3.1 percent after a November drop. Economists see that figure as a good measure of business spending. On the wage front, average earnings per hour rose 0.2 percent in January to $17.09. That was a smaller gain than in December and below the 0.3 percent increase expected on Wall Street. Still, hourly earnings were up 4 percent from a year ago, a level likely to keep officials at the Fed watching closely for any signs wage gains may be fueling inflation. "There's no threat of a rate hike out of this number, but no likelihood of a rate cut either," said Pado. The jobs report also contained an annual revision in which the Labor Department recalculated its job count for the 12 months through March 2006 based on state unemployment insurance records. It said it had undercounted employment growth during that period by a hefty 752,000 jobs, or 0.6 percent.
