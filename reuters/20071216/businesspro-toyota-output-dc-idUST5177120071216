 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ) expects its 
global production in 2008 to expand to about 9.9 million 
vehicles, about 500,000 units more than the projection for this 
year, the Nikkei business daily reported on Sunday. 

  The expected growth in global output is due to continuing 
robust sales in China, the Middle East and other emerging 
economies, the paper said.  Toyota is set to unseat General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) as the 
world's biggest car maker by sales volume this year.  No one at Toyota could be reached for comment.  (Reporting by  Aiko Hayashi ; Editing by  Alan Raybould )
