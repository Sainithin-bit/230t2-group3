 BERLIN  (Reuters) - European plane maker Airbus ( EAD.PA ) plans to agree in the coming week to sell four of its European factories to U.S. group Spirit AeroSystems Holdings ( SPR.N ), a German newspaper reported on Saturday. 

 The Internet edition of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung reported that Airbus chief Tom Enders believed it was possible the company could decide by next Friday to sell three plants in Germany and one in Britain to Spirit. The paper cited "sources in the sector" and said the factories in question were at Varel, Nordenham and Augsburg in Germany and Filton in Britain. Enders favored Spirit because of its expertise in carbon fiber technology, which is important for the construction of future plane models, the paper said. He did not want to sell Germany's plant in Laupheim to Spirit as the components produced there did not require carbon fiber technology. EADS's Airbus division is struggling to recover from costly delays to its A380 superjumbo jet that have prompted it to sell or find partners for plants and cut 10,000 jobs. German technology and space group OHB Technology ( OHBG.DE ) had previously been mentioned as a possible partner for some of the plants. (Writing by  Madeline Chambers ; Editing by  Alan Raybould )
