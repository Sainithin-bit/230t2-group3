 ROME  (Reuters) - Air France-KLM's ( AIRF.PA ) bid for Alitalia AZPIa.MI includes a share swap and a capital hike of 750 million euros ($1.09 billion), with up to 1,700 job cuts, Air France's Chairman Jean-Cyril Spinetta was quoted as saying. 

 Several Italian newspapers reported in their Sunday editions that Spinetta, speaking to Italian reporters in Paris, also said Air France would buy back Alitalia's maturing bonds and renew its fleet, with two or three new aircraft each year. "We have proposed to Alitalia a share swap, which means that Alitalia will become fully part of the holding with Air France and KLM," Spinetta was quoted as saying by Corriere della Sera. The share swap would allow the Italian Treasury, which is selling its 49.9 percent stake in Alitalia, to keep a minority stake in the new group, Il Sole 24 Ore said. "Why did we choose the share offer? Certainly not because we lack cash, we have lots of it. But because we want to give a strong signal of our willingness to integrate Alitalia in the group," the newspaper quoted Spinetta as saying. Air France-KLM and small Italian airline Air One are the two top contenders to buy Alitalia, which loses more than 1 million euros a day. Alitalia's shares tumbled to a record low on Friday after it emerged that both offers were far below market price -- with Air One bidding just 1 euro cent a share and Air France offering 35 euro cents per share, less than half Alitalia's closing share price of 0.75 euro on Friday. The struggling airline has put off a final decision on which offer to pick until December 18, after the government failed to identify a preferred partner last week. Regarding job cuts, a sensitive issue on which Alitalia's unions have threatened to strike, Spinetta said his plan coincided with Alitalia's own restructuring strategy and that cuts would number between 1,000 and 1,700 jobs. The head of the Franco-Dutch carrier also confirmed that Alitalia's twin hubs strategy would be ditched to focus on Rome's Fiumicino airport at the expense of Milan's Malpensa. "Malpensa is the main cause behind Alitalia's losses," Spinetta said, according to Corriere della Sera. The newspaper said Spinetta had not quantified how much money Air France-KLM was prepared to invest in Alitalia overall, saying that he did not know all the details of the company's financial situation. Air France could not immediately be reached for comment. In a separate interview with Il Sole 24 Ore, Deputy Prime Minister Francesco Rutelli said the Italian government was taking its time in analysing the offers because the industrial plans presented by Air One and Air France "are not convincing". Air One's all-Italian offer is less advantageous financially while Air France's leaves in doubt the future of Alitalia, he said. "We have to know if our children will go to China from Rome or Milan or via Paris," Rutelli said. In a statement late on Saturday, Air One said it would make Alitalia Europe's fourth-largest carrier. The domestic airline has firm orders for 90 new Airbus A320s that would allow it to replace the 77 old MD82s that Alitalia still uses on Italian and European routes, it said. Air One did not specify how long it would take to replace the fleet. (Reporting by  Silvia Aloisi  and Mathias Wildt, Editing by Erica Billingham)
