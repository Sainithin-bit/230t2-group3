 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc ( BRKa.N ), the conglomerate built by billionaire investor Warren Buffett, could be overvalued, Barron's reported on Sunday. 

 Barron's estimates that Berkshire is worth about $130,000 a share, about 10 percent below the current level. Because of its high price relative to its book value and earnings, Berkshire shares could be "dead money for at least a year," the investor weekly said. Barron's said American International Group ( AIG.N ), Wells Fargo ( WFC.N ), and American Express ( AXP.N ) may be better values in the financial sector. Wall Street is waiting for Buffett's next move, and insurance broker Marsh & McLennan ( MMC.N ) might appeal to him, Barron's said. Berkshire stock closed on Friday at $143,000, up 38 percent from its 12-month low of $103,800 hit on February 27. (Reporting by  Chris Reiter ; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)
