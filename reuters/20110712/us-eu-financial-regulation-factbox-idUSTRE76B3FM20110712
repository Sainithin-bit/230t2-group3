 (Reuters) - The European Union's regulatory in-tray is set to start bulging just as the bloc is trying to nail down agreement on two draft measures to curb short selling and shine a light on derivatives. 

 The regulatory agenda has been driven largely by the need to plug supervisory holes uncovered by the financial crisis. All measures are drafted by the European Commission and must be approved jointly by the European Parliament and member states to become law, a process that typically involves haggling and changes. The following are the key measures and related stories: BANK CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY Commission to propose draft "CRD IV" law on July 20 which updates the bloc's bank capital requirements rules to include tougher Basel III standards agreed at the global level. Countries outside the EU, such as the United States, watching closely to make sure there is no deviation from Basel III to give EU banks advantages. DERIVATIVES Measure to require central clearing and reporting of derivatives traded bilaterally between banks to curb risks and improve transparency. Bogged down in tussle between Britain, which wants the measure to cover all derivatives, and parliament, which wants only off-exchange contracts covered for clearing purposes. Deal not expected until September. SHORT SELLING Measure to crack down to curb excessive shorting of bonds or shares if it is causing volatility in markets. Parliament voted for ban on "naked" sovereign credit default swaps (CDS) or where the holder does not own any of the underlying government debt being "insured" against default. EU states think this is not practical and want a ban on "naked" sovereign debt selling or where the holder does not own the government bond being sold. Negotiations between the two sides continue over the summer. BANK CRISIS RESOLUTION Commission to propose in September mechanisms for winding up banks in an orderly way during a crisis, focusing on cross-border cooperation, such as common resolution tools. Also possible "haircuts" on bond holders to avoid taxpayers having to bail out banks again. SECURITIES TRADING Commission to propose in October a reform of its near four-year-old markets in financial instruments directive (MiFID). It will extend the scope of transparency and trading rules from shares to bonds and commodities and usher in a tougher regime for ultra-fast trading. There will also be a separate reform of the bloc's rules for tackling market abuses to include tougher sanctions. RATING AGENCIES Commission to propose in November ways to increase competition in credit ratings, a sector dominated by the "Big Three" of S&P, Moody's and Fitch. May also include requirements on rating agencies to be more open in how they rate sovereign debt and could include a ban on rating government debt of a country which is receiving international aid. AUDITORS Commission to propose in November ways to increase competition in auditing, a sector dominated by the "Big Four" of KPMG, Deloitte, PwC and Ernst & Young. Also to require auditors to blow the whistle on risky business practices at banks and become more independent of financial sector clients. OTHER MEASURES The Commission has also proposed a draft law to crack down on lax standards for granting home loans. It is also set to propose rules to increase protection for consumers that buy financial products and may step forward with another round of reforms (UCITS V) to EU mutual funds rules. New rules to crack down on hedge funds and private equity groups have already been approved and take effect around 2013, along with new Solvency II capital rules for insurers.
