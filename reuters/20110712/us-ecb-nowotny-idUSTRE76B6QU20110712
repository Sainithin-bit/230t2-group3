 VIENNA  (Reuters) - Credit rating agencies have worsened the crisis in the euro zone and financial markets could live without them, European Central Bank Governing Council member Ewald Nowotny said on Tuesday. 

 Nowotny, who also heads Austria's central bank, told Austrian television he did not need to go to a rating agency to assess the economic situation in Greece. "It is all apparent from public statistics and whether these statistics are accurate or not, the rating agencies ... do not give any more intrinsic knowledge, they simply give opinion," he told broadcaster ORF. "And these opinions, they continue to give them in such a way that it worsens the crisis." He said the financial world had survived in the past without the weighty influence of rating agencies. Creditors have been attempting to fine-tune a voluntary private-sector creditors' deal for Greece that can get past credit rating agencies without it being termed a default -- something that would likely cause further market turbulence. Nowotny echoed criticism of rating agencies by European officials earlier this month, who said there were signs of bias against the European Union after Moody's downgraded Portugal's debt to "junk" status. European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso has said the bloc was looking at getting away from its reliance on the mainly U.S.-based ratings companies and weighing possibilities for legal redress.
