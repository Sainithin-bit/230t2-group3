 DUBLIN  (Reuters) - The European Commission said on Tuesday it regretted the decision by Moody's Investors Service to downgrade Ireland to junk status, the first credit ratings agency to do so despite Dublin so far meeting its goals under an existing EU-IMF bailout. 

 "The European Commission regrets the decision of Moody's to downgrade Ireland today," Amadeu Altfaj, a spokesman for the Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn, said in a statement. "It contrasts very much with the recent data, which support a return to GDP growth this year, and the determined implementation of the program by the Irish government, which has taken strong ownership of it ... Thanks to the determined action, the Irish program is fully on track," he said. (Reporting by Carmel Crimmins)
