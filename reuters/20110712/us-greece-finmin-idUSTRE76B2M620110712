 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Greece must unite behind its austerity plan to secure a stronger bargaining position on the world financial stage, its finance minister said on Tuesday but his deputy cast doubt on important privatization targets. 

 Euro zone finance ministers completed talks in Brussels on Monday promising cheaper loans, longer maturities and a more flexible rescue fund to help Greece and other EU debtors and stop financial contagion. But at the same time they acknowledged for the first time that some form of default may be needed to cut Greece's huge debt burden and secure economic recovery. The government has committed to austerity measures to secure rescue funds. "We must implement the program in a climate of national unity and social cohesion, it is a prerequisite for a stronger bargaining position," Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said, underlining his calls for political consensus in a statement issued after the Eurogroup talks in Brussels. Athens needs a second bailout package to take it through to mid-2014 as it faces a funding gap next year under its current EU/IMF rescue deal and is highly unlikely to be able to return to bond markets in 2012. Its hopes for extended funding were kept alive after the socialist government passed a tough package of budget cuts, taxes, privatizations and structural reforms to stop generating deficits and make the 230-billion-euro economy more competitive, amidst stiff political opposition. "The invitation to the political opposition to negotiate together the new program and its details is still valid. Any consensus in Greece, even the smallest, strengthens our position abroad," Venizelos said in his statement. OPPOSITION VOICES The opposition conservatives who voted against the bailout deal last year have been deeply critical of the economic adjustment plan Athens agreed with the EU and the IMF, saying the policy mix is wrong, taxing the economy into a tail spin. Doubts over the government's pledges to raise 50 billion euros ($71.52 billion) from privatizations by the end of 2015 to pay down debt emerged late on Monday after deputy finance minister Pantelis Oikonomou predicted it would be tough to sell all the assets slated for privatization. Oikonomou told lawmakers that investors were more interested in financial instruments than in buying companies. "I predict, and you will see that I'll be right, that not everything earmarked for privatization will be sold, but much less. This is not possible (to sell everything)," Oikonomou said. Athens managed to borrow 1.62 billion euros mostly from Greek investors via T-bills on Tuesday at a slightly lower yield compared to a June auction to roll over maturing short-term debt despite rising market tension over the debt crisis which is staring to affect Spain and Italy. There were less foreign investors participating in the sale than a month ago. Greece's Prime Minister George Papandreou told a cabinet meeting on Tuesday that the EU was coming around belatedly to his view that the debt crisis was a broader problem. "From the beginning we have said a comprehensive European solution is needed. The debt crisis is the result of our own serious mistakes and chronic weakness but at the same time it is a crisis that concerns the euro," he said. "We proposed solutions such as eurobonds, we fought and continue to fight for these." In a withering open letter to Jean-Claude Juncker, the chairman of the Eurogroup, Papandreou said earlier European partners had acted too slowly to stem the crisis while creating a "cacophony" that had ultimately put domestic politics before the common currency.
