 DUBLIN  (Reuters) - Ireland has sufficient funding under its existing EU-IMF bailout package to cover its financing requirements until the end of 2013, the country's debt management agency said on Tuesday after Moody's Investors Service junked its sovereign debt. 

 The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) said the Moody's decision was primarily drive by a concern private investors would have to shoulder part of the burden from a possible second bailout for the country. "Moody's acknowledges that Ireland has demonstrated a strong commitment to fiscal consolidation and is successfully delivering on its objectives as required under the EU/IMF Program of Support," the NTMA said in a statement released minutes after the downgrade. The NTMA added that a pledge by euro zone finance ministers to make the bloc's rescue fund more flexible and cut the interest rate and extend the maturity of its loans was a positive development for Ireland.
