 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Budget talks between President Barack Obama and top Republicans have entered a critical phase this week as they try to end a standoff over raising the government's borrowing limit. 

 The talks are aimed at striking a deal to slash the long-term deficit, which Republicans say is needed before they will support an increase in the $14.3 trillion debt limit. The Treasury Department has warned that if Congress does not raise the debt limit by August 2, the United States will run out of money to fully pay its bills, triggering "catastrophic" economic consequences and possibly another recession. The federal budget deficit -- essentially the government's annual overdraft -- is expected to hit $1.4 trillion this year and stay in the trillion-dollar range for years. The federal debt is the government's total accumulated borrowing. The U.S. government borrows about $125 billion each month. HOW CLOSE ARE THEY TO DEAL? The White House, Republicans and Democrats have been negotiating since May to try to strike a deal on budget savings to clear the way for a borrowing cap rise. But with the debt limit deadline drawing perilously close, talks have entered an intense phase. Obama, a Democrat, said on Monday that both sides will meet every day this week. Republicans have said any deal to cut long-term deficits should involve "trillions" of dollars but have insisted those savings come from spending cuts alone. Democrats and Obama demand that any deal must involve a combination of both spending cuts and increased revenue, either through tax hikes or closing tax loopholes, or both. Negotiations led by Vice President Joe Biden collapsed in June when Republicans walked out over Democrats' demands that increased revenues be part of a deal, although significant progress was made in those sessions, with more than $1 trillion in savings identified. After a series of informal meetings last week between Obama and House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner, the top Republican in Congress, it appeared that a deal might be in reach when both indicated that a $4 trillion, 10-year deficit-cutting deal was on the table. But on Saturday night, ahead of a scheduled negotiating session at the White House on Sunday, Boehner abruptly announced that a $4 trillion grand bargain was impossible -- again because of Democratic demands that increased revenue be part of the package. Boehner told Obama -- who on Monday was still pressing for a $4 trillion package -- that a smaller $2 trillion deal, made up of spending cuts alone, was more realistic. In a press conference on Monday, Obama said he was willing to consider cuts to popular entitlement programs such as Medicare, the government-run health program for the elderly. He scolded Republicans for being unwilling to discuss tax increases. "If not now, when?" he asked. The decision by Boehner, well known as a dealmaker, reflects how wary he is of offending Republicans on his right flank, particularly those affiliated with the conservative Tea Party movement. IS THERE A WAY REPUBLICANS CAN COMPROMISE ON TAXES? One idea Democrats have proposed on taxes and revenue increases is the closing of some tax loopholes now. They have then offered Republicans a deal: if Republicans will agree to let the Bush-era tax cuts on the wealthiest Americans expire in 2013, they will work on reforming the tax code that, as Obama said on Monday, "could potentially lower everybody's rates and broaden the base." Obama added: "Nobody is looking at raising taxes now. We're talking about potentially 2013 and the out-years." But Republicans have so far balked at this offer. Eric Cantor, the No. 2 Republican in the House, has said Republicans could agree to a deal centered on closing certain tax loopholes, and ending breaks for big energy companies, if such an agreement was revenue-neutral. In other words, if the tax breaks were scrapped, then these need to be offset by tax cuts elsewhere. Yet Democrats object to that approach. Democratic aides also indicated on Monday there would not be enough votes from their side on a deal that only included spending cuts. So the path to a deal is still not clear. To push a package through the House of Representatives, Boehner is going to need Democratic help. But Obama is already facing a backlash from liberal Democrats in the House over his willingness to discuss cuts to entitlement programs. Even if party leaders strike a deal, it will still need much work -- and more time -- to garner the necessary votes in Congress to get it passed before August 2. That makes the next 10 days crucial. ARE THE MARKETS WORRIED? U.S. stocks slumped more than 1 percent on Monday as worries about the U.S. budget talks and the euro-zone debt crisis sent a shudder through markets. Bond markets have stayed calm and yields remain low, but that could change quickly if talks collapsed. Three credit rating agencies have said the U.S. could lose its coveted AAA credit rating if no deal emerged and the debt limit was not raised. One has said that if a deal does not look imminent by mid-July, it will start looking at the possibility of downgrading the rating. WHO HAS THE MOST AT STAKE IN THE TALKS? There are considerable risks on all sides. Many economists predict that a default by the United States will trigger panic in the bond markets, a spike in interest rates across the economy, with investors dumping the dollar en masse, and another recession. Obama is widely seen as the steward of the economy, and another recession could doom his chances of re-election in 2012. If Boehner fails to get a "yes" vote in the House to raise the debt limit, Republicans will likely be blamed -- in the short-term at least -- for the economic turmoil that will follow.
