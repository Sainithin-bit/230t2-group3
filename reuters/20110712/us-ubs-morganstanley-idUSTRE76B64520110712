 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. brokerage arm of UBS ( UBSN.VX ) said it hired Morgan Stanley Smith Barney brokerage executive Jon Mallon to manage its Santa Rosa, California, branch and help attract and advise high-net-worth customers from affluent towns north of San Francisco. 

 Mallon began his career at Morgan Stanley in 1993, but left two years later to join Lehman Brothers, where he worked until 2001, according to FINRA BrokerCheck records. After brief stints at Broadband Capital Management and C.E. Unterberg Towbin LLC, Mallon returned to Morgan Stanley in 2007. UBS said Mallon was most recently chief operating officer for Morgan Stanley Smith Barney's Western U.S. division. (Reporting by  Joseph A. Giannone )
