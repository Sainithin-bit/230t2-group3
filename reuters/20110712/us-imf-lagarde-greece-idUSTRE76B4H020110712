 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday welcomed Europe's decision that Greece's debt problems require a broader response and said it would cooperate in trying to help. 

 "The IMF welcomes the Eurogroup reaffirming their commitment to safeguard stability in the euro area," IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said in a statement. "We also welcome the ... recognition of the need for a broader, more forward-looking policy response to assist Greece in its efforts to restore growth and competitiveness, and to bolster debt sustainability," she added. European Union leaders were poised to hold an emergency meeting of finance ministers after acknowledging for the first time that some form of Greek default may be needed to cut Athens' debts and stop contagion to Italy and Spain. A senior euro zone source told Reuters the meeting likely will be held on Friday. Earlier on Tuesday, a bank lobby group, the Institute of International Finance, said the Euro zone countries and IMF need to demonstrate they can craft a Greek rescue plan or risk seeing financial markets "spinning out of control." Lagarde's statement effectively acknowledged that more must be done to prop up crisis-stricken Greece and get it to a point where it can sustain its own debts. "The IMF will work closely with Greece and European partners to support these objectives," she said. (Reporting by  Glenn Somerville ; Editing by Andrew Hay)
