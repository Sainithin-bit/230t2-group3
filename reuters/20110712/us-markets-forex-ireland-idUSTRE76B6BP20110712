 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The euro fell against the U.S. dollar on Tuesday after Moody's Investors Service on Tuesday cut Ireland's credit rating to junk status, saying the country will likely need additional rounds of official financing before it can return to international capital markets. 

 Moody's cut Ireland's ratings by one notch to Ba1 from Baa3 and kept a negative outlook on the rating. The euro was last down 0.3 percent at $1.3987. The session low of $1.3835 was touched earlier in the global session. The euro also fell against the yen and Swiss franc slipping 1.3 percent against the yen and 1 percent against the Swiss franc in late afternoon New York trade. (Reporting by  Nick Olivari )
