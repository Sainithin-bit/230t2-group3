 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Risks that private creditors will be required to share the burden of future euro zone bailouts have been growing in the past few days, further weighing on the ratings of Ireland, Portugal and Greece, Moody's Investors Service said on Tuesday. 

 Prospects of private sector participation in additional rounds of financing for those countries have been clear in the latest statements from euro zone finance ministers, Moody's analyst Dietmar Hornung told Reuters in an interview. "The Eurogroup statement from yesterday confirms our view that the euro area is willing to continue to provide liquidity support for peripheral countries and to give them time to achieve a sustainable financial position," Hornung said. "But at the same time we see a growing possibility that, as a precondition of additional rounds of liquidity support here, private-sector creditors participation will be required." The risk is that Ireland, Portugal and Greece will be unable to return to international capital markets once their current bailout programs expire because the private-sector precondition would likely increase borrowing costs for those countries, Moody's has said. Asked whether Italy would also be vulnerable in that scenario, Hornung said the country stands in a different category. "Italy is able to fund itself on the market, I don't see a parallel here," he said. (Editing by Leslie Adler)
