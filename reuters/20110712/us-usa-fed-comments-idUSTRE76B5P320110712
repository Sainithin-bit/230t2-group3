 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve, which last month ended its latest round of bond-buying stimulus, has yet to offer any hint it will ease monetary policy further despite signs that jobs growth has stalled. 

 But at their most recent policy-setting meeting, officials expressed sharply divergent views on the future of policy, with some expressing support for doing more if the recovery is too sluggish and inflation eases as expected, and others arguing for tighter policy if increases in inflation do not moderate. The meeting ended on June 22 with the Fed holding rates at near zero and repeating its promise to keep them low for an extended period. U.S. primary dealers polled by Reuters see a 20 percent chance the Fed will embark on a new round of stimulus in the next two years. The following are recent comments from Fed policymakers (* denotes 2011 voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets U.S. monetary policy): MINUTES OF JUNE 21-22 FOMC MEETING, released July 12 "On the one hand, a few members noted that, depending on how economic conditions evolve, the Committee might have to consider providing additional monetary policy stimulus, especially if economic growth remained too slow to meaningfully reduce the unemployment rate in the medium run. On the other hand, a few members viewed the increase in inflation risks as suggesting that economic conditions might well evolve in a way that would warrant the committee taking steps to begin removing policy accommodation sooner than currently anticipated." KANSAS CITY FED PRESIDENT THOMAS HOENIG, July 7 "Others think inflation is fairly well contained, they don't see the imbalance risk that I see, and so ... I'm not in the majority." ST. LOUIS FED PRESIDENT JAMES BULLARD, June 30 "If the economy is not performing well, then the committee should consider taking additional action." KANSAS CITY FED PRESIDENT THOMAS HOENIG, June 30 "An extended zero-interest rate policy is producing new sources of fragility that we need to be aware of." * DALLAS FED PRESIDENT RICHARD FISHER, June 28 "We've got monetary policy just about right ... If and when we see the economy pick up, then we will have to consider how we are going to take out that stimulus that we have provided." * MINNEAPOLIS FED PRESIDENT NARAYANA KOCHERLAKOTA, June 27 "You are all very aware that our country has gone through a difficult financial crisis and that we are still only beginning to make our way back from its impact." * FED CHAIRMAN BEN BERNANKE, June 22 "We have an awful lot of uncertainty right now about how much of this slowdown is temporary and how much is permanent, so that would suggest, all else equal, a little bit of time to see what happens would be useful in making policy decisions." FOMC STATEMENT, June 22 "The unemployment rate remains elevated; however, the Committee expects the pace of recovery to pick up over coming quarters, and the unemployment rate to resume its gradual decline toward levels that the Committee judges to be consistent with its dual mandate. Inflation has moved up recently, but the Committee anticipates that inflation will subside to levels at or below those consistent with the Committee's dual mandate as the effects of past energy and other commodity price increases dissipate."
