 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell said it was evacuating 300 more support workers from U.S. Gulf of Mexico facilities on Saturday due to Hurricane Dean. 

 "Since the beginning of the week, Shell has evacuated approximately 460 people, with approximately 300 scheduled to be evacuated today," Shell said in a news release Saturday. "Evacuations are expected to continue through the weekend." Shell has shut down production on approximately 10,000 barrels of oil and 15 million cubic feet of natural gas per day in preparation for the storm's possible entry into the U.S. Gulf, Shell said.
