 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - IBM ( IBM.N ), the world's largest 
technology services company, reported 11 percent profit growth 
but its shares fell 5 percent as the results failed to beat the 
targets of some investors who had driven the stock up recently. 

  International Business Machines Corp.'s quarterly revenue 
was boosted by a string of software-company acquisitions, while 
it also reported on Thursday $17.8 billion in services contract 
signings, a key indicator of future business.  Fourth-quarter net income advanced to $3.54 billion, or 
$2.31 per share, from $3.19 billion, or $1.99 per share, a year 
earlier. Revenue climbed to $26.3 billion from $24.4 billion.  Earnings before special items were $2.26 per share, topping 
the Wall Street consensus forecast of $2.19, according to 
Reuters Estimates.  But IBM shares fell 3.8 percent to $95.70 after the 
results, from their New York Stock Exchange close of $99.45.  "It looks like a great quarter -- but that was priced in," 
said Jerome Heppelmann, chief investment officer of Liberty 
Ridge Capital, which does not own IBM shares. Although earnings 
topped published Wall Street targets, he said they only met the 
"whisper numbers" of less official expectations.  IBM stock had risen 37 percent since hitting a year low 
last July, and 14 percent since the previous earnings report.  The stock, up about 21 percent in the last 12 months prior 
to the results, was trading at 15 times expected 2007 earnings 
per share, compared to a multiple of 17 for Hewlett-Packard Co. 
( HPQ.N ), which competes with IBM in computer hardware, and 20 
for services rival Accenture Ltd. ( ACN.N ).  "The only area that was disappointing on first glance was 
the hardware area," said Marc Heilweil, manager of Spectrum 
Advisory Services' Marathon Value Portfolio, whose biggest 
holding is IBM.  Hardware revenue rose to $7.2 billion from $6.9 billion, 
while the business's gross profit margin slipped to 41 percent 
from 42 percent.  Armonk, New York-based IBM has been expanding in software, 
its most profitable business, and last year bought 11 software 
providers including Internet Security Systems Inc. and FileNet 
Corp.  Technology services signings recovered after slumping 
earlier in 2006, as IBM won deals from the German military and 
Vodafone Group Plc ( VOD.L ).  "We feel good about the momentum as we enter 2007," IBM 
Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge told investors on a 
conference call following IBM's year-end financial report.  Chief Executive Samuel Palmisano last year announced a 
total of 14 acquisitions worth about $4.9 billion. They partly 
reflected an IBM push to automate services offerings, a 
traditionally lower-margin business, with more-profitable 
software.  Revenue from its software business, which typically 
accounts for about a fifth of total sales, rose 15 percent to 
$5.65 billion from $4.9 billion. The segment's gross profit 
margin was 86.5 percent compared with 86.3 percent a year 
earlier.  Revenue from technology services, IBM's largest unit, rose 
to $12.8 billion from $12 billion. The business signed services 
contracts worth $17.8 billion in the fourth quarter, the 
highest in four years and up 55 percent from $11.5 billion a 
year earlier.  (Additional reporting by  Eric Auchard  and  Michael Kahn  in
