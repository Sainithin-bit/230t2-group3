 NEW YORK  Jan 18 (Reuters) - Shares of Apple Inc. ( AAPL.O ) fell 3.6 percent in early trading on Thursday, a day after the maker of Macintosh computers and iPod digital music players delivered forecasts that fell short of Wall Street estimates.   The decline comes despite Apple's report that fourth-quarter profit jumped 78 percent and iPod sales topped 21 million, both beating analysts' expectations. Macintosh computer sales also rose but were lighter than expected, analysts said.  Apple's forecast for the second-quarter lagged analysts' targets, saying it expects profit per share of 54 cents to 56 cents and revenue of $4.8 billion to $4.9 billion. That compares with analysts estimates 60 cents per share on revenue of $5.2 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.      While the company is known for conservative forecasts, the outlook comes amid concerns about Apple's ability to sustain iPod growth, increase Mac sales and maintain profit margins.      J.P. Morgan analyst Bill Shope cut his rating on the stock to "Neutral" from "Overweight," noting that strong iPod sales during the previous holiday season does not guarantee continued success or portend a boost in Mac sales.      "Our previous thesis on Mac share gains has proven to be too optimistic, and this was a core component of our bullish stance on the shares," he said in a note to clients. "In addition, as we enter the seasonally weaker period of the year, iPod shipments may disappoint."      Not all analysts agreed with that stance. The share decline comes despite a chorus of Wall Street price target upgrades, including UBS, which lifted its target to $124 from $118, and Goldman Sachs, which raised its view to $110 from $102.      Goldman's Laura Conigliaro said the dip in price presented a buying opportunity, ahead of the introduction of iPhone, which was unveiled at Macworld last week. Apple's goal is to sell about 10 million iPhones in 2008.      "The fact that iPhone will be shipping by June will have investors anticipating it early in that quarter, suggesting that any nearer-term pullbacks should be bought," she said in a note to clients.      Shares of Cupertino, California-based Apple rose 18 percent in 2006, after more than doubling in 2005 and tripling in 2004, propelled by strong sales of iPods and a rejuvenated line of Mac desktop and notebook computers.      The shares, which last week hit an all-time high of $97.80, on Thursday eased to $91.48, down from Wednesday's close of $94.95 on Nasdaq.
