 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices jumped at the 
sharpest rate in eight months during December , climbing 0.5 
percent as prices for energy products shot up after three 
straight months of declines, the Labor Department said on 
Thursday. 

  Last month's gain in the Consumer Price Index was the first 
increase since August and followed a flat November. The 
December rise was the sharpest since a 0.6 percent increase 
last April.  Wall Street analysts had forecast that overall consumer 
prices would rise by 0.4 percent.  So-called core consumer prices, excluding food and energy 
costs, increased 0.2 percent in December after being unchanged 
in November. The rise in core prices was in line with 
forecasts.  Federal Reserve officials have said they remain wary about 
the potential for inflation to flare up, though expectations 
for price rises have been relatively well contained. The Fed is 
expected to keep U.S. interest rates on hold when its 
policy-setting committee meets later this month on January 
30-31.  For the full year 2006, the consumer price index increased 
by 2.5 percent , an improvement over 2005 when it was up 3.4 
percent.  In December, energy prices shot up by 4.6 percent after a 
0.2 percent fall in November and much larger decreases in 
September and October. Some of the increases in energy prices 
have likely eased since as world oil prices have come down.  The December increase in energy prices was the biggest in 
11 months, since a 5.0 percent price acceleration last January, 
the department said.
