 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Continental Airlines CAL.N, the No. 4 U.S. carrier, posted a smaller-than-expected fourth-quarter loss on Thursday as rising labor costs were partly offset by higher air fares and fuller planes. 

 Continental's results are another small sign of recovery in the airline industry, as it rides a surge in demand for air travel. On Wednesday, American Airlines parent AMR Corp. AMR.N and low-cost leader Southwest Airlines Co. ( LUV.N ) posted fourth-quarter profits. Continental's shares were down 5 cents, or 0.1 percent, at $49.95 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. On Wednesday, the shares, which have risen 65 percent over the last three months, hit their highest level since February 2001. Continental's net loss narrowed to $26 million, or 29 cents a share, from $43 million, or 53 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding a charge of $22 million for lump-sum payments to retiring pilots, Continental's loss was 4 cents a share. Wall Street analysts, on average, were expecting a fourth-quarter loss before charges of 15 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. The U.S. airline industry -- battered in recent years by low-fare competition and high costs -- managed to initiate several lasting fare hikes recently, helping some carriers to post profits for the first time in more than five years. But Continental's loss, burdened by an 11.9 percent increase in labor costs to $716 million, shows that the U.S. airline industry is still not completely recovered from its prolonged slump. "It would have been better had they been able to eke out a profit like AMR," said Ray Neidl, an analyst with Calyon Securities. "All legacy carriers need to be diligent about (controlling costs). On the revenue side, things look positive." Continental's operating revenue rose 11 percent to $3.16 billion, as the carrier's load factor -- a measure of the percentage of seats filled by paying passengers -- rose to a fourth-quarter record 79.8 percent. Higher ticket prices helped the company increase unit revenue by 4.3 percent. The fourth quarter is generally a tough period for airlines because, aside from the frantic travel over the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays, demand is soft. Things are looking good for the airline industry so far this year. Oil prices have fallen about 16 percent since the beginning of the year, which should lower the cost of jet fuel -- a major expense for airlines. "For Continental, the story is 2007. With oil down sharply, they should do well," said Jim Corridore, an equities analyst with Standard & Poor's. The results come as the industry braces for long-awaited consolidation among traditional airlines. US Airways Group Inc. ( LCC.N ) has made a hostile bid for larger, bankrupt rival Delta Air Lines Inc. DALRQ.PK. Analysts and industry observers expect the deal to spark other mergers if it succeeds. For its part, Continental, which has said it would prefer to remain independent, has held preliminary talks with United Airlines UAUA.O, people familiar with the situation have said.
