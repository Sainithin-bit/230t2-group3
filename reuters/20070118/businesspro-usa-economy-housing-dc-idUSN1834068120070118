 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The pace of U.S. home construction 
climbed 4.5 percent in December, a second-straight monthly 
increase that ran contrary to analyst expectations, but for all 
of 2006 the rate of new home building posted the biggest 
decline in 15 years, a government report on Thursday showed. 

  The Commerce Department said housing starts closed out the 
year at an annual pace of 1.642 million units in December 
compared to 1.572 million units in November.  Economists had forecast December housing starts to fall to 
1.560 million units from November's originally reported pace of 
1.588 million units.  For all of 2006 housing starts totaled about 1.8 million, 
that was down 12.9 percent from the 2005 total, the biggest 
decline since 1991.  Building permits, which offer a clue to future construction 
plans, rose 5.5 percent to a 1.596 million unit pace.  Economists were expecting building permits would register a 
1.500 million unit pace, close to the 1.513 million unit figure 
reported for November.  Permit applications for the year were down 14.9 percent, 
the biggest decline since 1990.
