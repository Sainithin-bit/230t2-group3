 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oil dropped below $50 a barrel on Thursday for the first time since May 2005 after U.S. data showed a sharp increase in crude supply in the United States, the world's top oil consumer. 

 U.S. crude futures settled down $1.76 at $50.48 a barrel, after hitting a 20-month low of $49.90 during intraday activity. London Brent fell $1.03 to $51.75 a barrel. Oil has dropped 18.3 percent since the start of the year, spurred by warm U.S. weather that crimped demand for winter heating oil and bolstered inventories. The plunge marked the biggest price slide over 10 trading days since April 2003, after the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. U.S. government data released Thursday showed an increase of 6.8 million barrels in crude stockpiles last week, well above analyst expectations of a 100,000-barrel rise. Distillate supplies, including heating oil, rose 900,000 barrels while gasoline stocks jumped 3.5 million barrels. "The market is selling off on the shocking headline showing huge builds in crude stocks," said Phil Flynn, an analyst for Alaron Trading. Analysts had said a firm break below $50 a barrel could cause an even steeper price slide by triggering sell options held by oil producers. But U.S. crude quickly rebounded on Thursday, after falling below $50 a barrel on short covering, with some analysts predicting oil prices may now be near a floor. "Picking the bottom for this market is like catching the proverbial falling knife, but I am seeing a number of signs of extreme oversold conditions," said Joel Marver, chief technical analyst at IFR division of Thomson Financial in Boston. LATE WINTER Prices hit fresh 20-month lows for three consecutive sessions after Saudi Arabia said production cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries were working well and an emergency meeting of the cartel was not necessary. "After seven-plus weeks of a drawdown, the build in inventory, with OPEC cutting, is a major negative," Christopher Jarvis, an analyst at Caprock Risk Management, said. "Coupled with products also building robustly in the dead of winter only compounds the short-term problems for crude oil." Prices found some support early in the session from a cold snap in the United States, which triggered the long-awaited winter demand for heating fuel. "Current U.S. weather forecasts should also provide some staying power to yesterday's higher move," said Man Financial. Colder weather in the U.S. Northeast -- which consumes about 80 percent of the nation's heating oil -- was expected to push demand above average for most of the week, private forecaster DTN Meteorlogix said. The National Weather Service said temperatures could average below normal along the eastern seaboard for another two weeks, though some warming could reach the Midwest and West next week. But the icy weather has come late and oil supplies are already ample, analysts said, limiting the price effects. (Additional reporting by Felicia Loo in Singapore and  Randy Fabi  in London)
