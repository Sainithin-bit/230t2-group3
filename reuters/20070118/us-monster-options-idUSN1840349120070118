 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Federal prosecutors are intensifying their criminal probe into stock-option manipulation at recruitment service Monster Worldwide Inc. ( MNST.O ), The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, citing sources familiar with the probe. 

 This was prompted in part by e-mails written by former general counsel Myron Olesnyckyj that suggest he knew about the accounting implications of backdated options, the Journal said, citing the sources. Olesnyckyj was suspended and then fired by Monster last year. He could not immediately be reached for comment. He indicated his understanding of accounting rules and the proper handling of grants in e-mails with senior finance and human resources officials, the Journal said, according to a person familiar with the matter. Another e-mail discussed his finessing of outside auditors, according to people who saw the e-mail, the paper said. Prosecutors may try to focus on him or get him to cooperate in investigating more senior officials, the Journal reported, citing people familiar with the case. Monster selected favorable grant dates for new hires, salesman-of-the-year awards and senior executives, according to sources cited by the Journal. Monster officials could not immediately be reached for comment. Monster admitted in December that it had overstated profit from 1997 to 2005 by $271.9 million and that the exercise price of a substantial number of stock option grants from 1997 through March 2003 was different from the fair market value of the underlying shares on the grant date. Monster's founder and chief executive resigned in October. He left the board after declining to be interviewed again for the company's probe. Nearly 200 companies are investigating their practices for granting stock options or are under investigation by U.S. authorities such as the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Internal Revenue Service and the Justice Department. Options backdating is a practice in which companies change the grant dates of stock options to boost their value to top executives. The practice is illegal if companies do a poor job of disclosing it or improperly account for it.
