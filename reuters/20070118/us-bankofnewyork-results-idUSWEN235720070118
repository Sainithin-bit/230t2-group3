 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bank of New York Co. ( BK.N ) said on Thursday fourth-quarter operating profit rose 7 percent, more than analysts expected, helped by growth in its main business of securities servicing. 

 Overall profit more than quadrupled, helped by a $1.38 billion gain from the October 1 swap of its 338-branch network for JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s ( JPM.N ) corporate trust business. Operating profit rose to $435 million, or 58 cents per share, from $405 million, or 53 cents, a year earlier. Revenue from continuing operations rose 22 percent to $1.89 billion, helped by an 18 percent jump in servicing fees. Analysts polled by Reuters Estimates on average forecast profit of 55 cents per share on revenue of $1.84 billion. Including the asset swap and other items, net income totaled $1.79 billion, or $2.36 per share. Bank of New York is reshaping itself by focusing on custody services for institutional investors and asset management. Capping what Chief Executive Thomas Renyi called a "watershed year," the company agreed last month to buy Mellon Financial Corp. MEL.N for $16.5 billion. "It is managing through several significant transactions extremely well," said Tom McCrohan, a senior analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC. "It is benefiting from an acceleration of securities servicing fees. It appears that core trends within the corporate trust business are on track, stable and strong." McCrohan has a "buy" rating on Bank of New York. In morning trading, Bank of New York shares rose 89 cents to $41.14 on the New York Stock Exchange. On a conference call, executives said Bank of New York expects to benefit this year from rising equity markets and continued strong merger and acquisition activity. "Virtually every product line that we've got has an international component, and a growing one at that," Renyi said. "Cross-border assets will improve much more dramatically than domestic assets." MELLON The merger of Bank of New York and Mellon, creating Bank of New York Mellon Corp., is slated to close around July 1. It would create a power in custody services, overseeing about $16.6 trillion of assets, and one of the biggest asset managers. Renyi would become chairman, while Mellon Chief Executive Robert Kelly would become chief executive. Mellon on Wednesday said growing asset management fees contributed to a 14 percent increase in quarterly profit, also topping forecasts. Bank of New York said fourth-quarter servicing fees totaled $958 million, including a doubling of fees from issuer services and double-digit gains in investor and broker-dealer services. These offset a 19 percent drop in execution and clearing services, which the bank attributed to a spinoff of some operations into a new company, BNY ConvergEx Group. Private banking and asset-management fees jumped 42 percent to $168 million. Revenue rose 1 percent from foreign exchange and trading and 2 percent from global payment services, while service charges fell 9 percent. Among other custody banks, Northern Trust Corp. ( NTRS.O ) said quarterly profit rose 16 percent, and State Street Corp. ( STT.N ) posted a 17 percent increase. Both released results Wednesday. Through Wednesday, Bank of New York shares had risen 25 percent in the last year, compared with a 12 percent gain in the Philadelphia KBW Bank Index .BKX.
