 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Abbott Laboratories Inc. ( ABT.N ), reported to be in talks about selling its diagnostics division to General Electric Co. ( GE.N ), will not sell two of its four diagnostics units, a source close to the matter said on Thursday. 

 Abbott will not consider the sale of its molecular diagnostics or diabetes businesses, the source said. The source could not say whether the other two diagnostics units -- in-vitro diagnostics and point-of-care in-hospital testing -- were in play. The New York Times, quoting people involved with the talks, reported that GE was near a deal to buy Abbott's diagnostics division for as much as $5 billion. Neither Abbott nor GE would comment about a potential deal. JP Morgan analyst Michael Weinstein, in a note to clients, said the diabetes and molecular diagnostics businesses are the two highest growth areas in Abbott's diagnostics portfolio. The diabetes business involves glucose monitoring meters and test strips. The molecular diagnostics business involves genetic testing, including special tests to detect breast cancer. Weinstein said Abbott was more likely to dispose of its lower-margin, lower-growth businesses in immunochemistry and blood screening. Those are the very areas that might be of interest to GE as it expands its GE Healthcare unit into the so-called in-vitro diagnostics space. The segment includes a wide range of lab-based tests. A potential deal with Abbott for those businesses would follow a similar deal last year by German conglomerate Siemens AG ( SIEGn.DE ), which bought the diagnostics division of drugs and chemicals group Bayer AG BAYG.DE for $5.27 billion. GE, Siemens and Philips Electronics NV ( PHG.AS ), the big three players in the medical imaging space, are working to expand their capabilities in molecular imaging, which uses chemical agents to enhance scans to detect the early stages of disease. For GE, a foray into more traditional test-tube-based diagnostics would follow its $10.7 billion acquisition in 2004 of British bioscience company Amersham Plc, which is developing molecular agents that could enhance PET scans and other advanced tests.
