  By David McMahon NEW YORK  Jan 18 (Reuters) - Crude oil futures fell
sharply on Thursday, hitting 20-month lows, while U.S. stock
indexes ended lower after a conservative forecast from Apple
Inc ( AAPL.O ) sparked worries about the health of the
technology sector.  After news of a big surge in inventories, oil crashed
below $50 a barrel for the first time since May 2005, hurting
the shares of energy companies such as Exxon Mobil ( XOM.N ) and
also helping drive down the price of gold.  The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  ended the day down
9.22 points, or 0.07 percent, at 12,567.93. The Standard &
Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  fell 4.25 points, or 0.30 percent, to
finish at 1,426.37, while the Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC 
dropped 36.21 points, or 1.46 percent, to close at 2,443.21.  The dollar held near a four-year high against the yen
after the Bank of Japan kept interest rates on hold, and a
crop of solid U.S. economic data reinforced a view that the
Federal Reserve is unlikely to cut interest rates any time
soon.  U.S. data showed an unexpected strengthening in housing
starts, the largest jump in consumer prices in eight months,
and a surprisingly strong rise in factory activity in the U.S.
Mid-Atlantic region. For details click on [nN18446448].  Despite the strong data, the dollar eased against most
major currencies, and Treasury bond prices edged higher as
some investors saw a buying opportunity after a six-week
sell-off. A speech by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke did not touch
on monetary policy and was largely brushed off by the market.  U.S. crude oil futures for February delivery CLc1
touched $49.90 a barrel, the lowest since May 2005, and
settled down $1.76 at $50.48 a barrel on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. The price of NYMEX crude oil has tumbled
36 percent from a record peak of $78.40 struck last July.  "The market is selling off on the shocking headline
showing huge builds in crude stocks," oil analyst Phil Flynn
at Alaron Trading said.  COMEX gold for February delivery GCG7 lost $5.20 to
settle at $628.10 an ounce, falling in sync with oil.  STOCKS SLIDE  Tech issues led the decline, and Apple shares suffered
their biggest one-day drop in nearly a year, a day after the
maker of the iPod unveiled record quarterly results, but
disappointed investors with a forecast below expectations.  Apple's stock had surged to a record high last week after
the company unveiled the iPhone, a new product that combines
features of its popular music player with a mobile phone.  The sharp drop in the price of oil helped send Exxon Mobil
( XOM.N ) shares down 0.69 percent to $71.96.  European shares ended the day little moved, with the
FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  down just 0.06 percent at 1,509.47.  Tokyo's Nikkei share average  .N225  hit a 9-month high
after the BOJ's decision to keep interest rates steady at 0.25
percent, the lowest in the industrialized world. The Nikkei
gained 0.63 percent, or 109.58 points, to 17,370.93, its
highest close since last May.  DOLLAR SURGES VS YEN, BONDS GAIN  The dollar jumped to a near four-year high of 121.60 yen
after the BOJ's policy decision, which overturned expectations
just a week ago that the central bank was set to raise
interest rates. The yen also slipped to near record lows
against the euro.  In late New York trading, the dollar was up 0.49 percent
at 121.20 yen, compared with 120.61 yent late on Wednesday.  Meanwhile the euro  EUR=  rose around 0.2 percent to
$1.2955 from $1.2936 late Wednesday, while sterling  GBP= 
also was up 0.2 percent at $1.9737 from $1.9696 the previous
day.  U.S. Treasury debt prices rose as investors took a break
from weeks of selling despite new evidence that economic
growth may not be slowing as much as originally expected.  Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR rose 8/32 in price to
99-00/32, for a yield of 4.75 percent, down from 4.79 percent
on Wednesday. The 2-year note US2YT=RR crept up 1/32 in
price to 99-23/32, for a yield of 4.89 percent, down from 4.91
percent on Wednesday.
