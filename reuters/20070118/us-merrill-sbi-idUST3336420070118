 TOKYO  (Reuters) - In a deal that will increase its exposure to Japan's resurgent property market, U.S. investment bank Merrill Lynch MER.N agreed on Thursday to provide up $4 billion in financing for real estate projects backed by Japanese venture capital firm SBI Holdings Inc. ( 8473.T ). 

 Merrill will arrange or directly contribute up to 500 billion yen ($4.15 billion) in funding for large-scale residential developments, SBI said. Most of the projects are likely to be in Japan, where land prices are rebounding, though the partnership will also seek investments abroad. SBI's role will be to identify worthy projects while Merrill will invest "on an opportunity basis", a source close to the deal said. Merrill's ultimate contribution will depend on the availability of suitable targets. "Five hundred billion yen is the ceiling," the source said. Urban Japanese land prices have bounced back after a 15-year slide and investors have lined up to finance a construction boom in office towers, apartments and shopping complexes that is transforming parts of Tokyo and other cities. The boom has drawn parallels with Japan's disastrous 1980s land and stock price bubble, though bankers say stricter regulation and more sophisticated financing tools have cut the risks this time around. Shares in SBI Holdings closed up 4.25 percent at 46,600 yen, beating a 0.63 percent rise in the benchmark Nikkei  .N225 . On Wednesday, Nomura Holdings Inc. ( 8604.T ), Japan's biggest securities brokerage, and the government-affiliated Development Bank of Japan (DBJ) said they would create a $400 million equity fund to buy stakes in real estate development companies.
