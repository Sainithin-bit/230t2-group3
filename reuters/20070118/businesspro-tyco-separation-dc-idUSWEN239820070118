 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Tyco International Ltd. ( TYC.N ) said 
on Thursday it expected its separation into three separate 
publicly-traded companies to occur early in the second quarter. 

  Tyco filed statements with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission to register stock for Tyco Electronics and Tyco 
Healthcare. The separation will be done through tax-free 
dividends to existing Tyco shareholders, the company said.
