 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - General Electric Co ( GE.N ) was near a 
deal to buy the diagnostics business of Abbott Laboratories Inc 
( ABT.N ) for more than $5 billion, according to a story on the 
New York Times Web site late on Wednesday. 

  The story, which cited people familiar with the matter, 
said that buying the Abbott unit, which has annual revenues of 
about $4 billion, would expand G.E.'s stable of diagnostic 
products and services.  A Wall Street Journal Web site story, citing people 
familiar with the matter, also reported that a deal was near 
but that it did not have additional details.  The Journal said it was possible GE could be buying a large 
part, but not all, of the Abbott unit.  Representatives from GE or Abbott were not immediately 
available for comment.
