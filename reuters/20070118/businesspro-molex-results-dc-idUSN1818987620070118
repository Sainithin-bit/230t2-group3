 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Molex Corp. ( MOLX.O )( MOLXA.O ), a maker 
of electronic components, on Thursday posted a 13.5 percent 
increase in second-quarter earnings, in line with its 
recently-lowered expectations, and forecast 
stronger-than-expected revenue in the third quarter. 

  While Chief Executive Martin Slark said the company's 
fiscal second-quarter profit margins were weaker than expected 
and orders fell from the prior quarter, the company was 
addressing its "short-term challenges." The company's shares 
rose in after-hours electronic trading.  Net income in the second quarter rose to $66.4 million, or 
36 cents a share, compared with $58.5 million, or 31 cents a 
share, a year earlier.  Analysts, on average, had expected a profit of 35 cents, 
according to Reuters Estimates. Last week, the company, whose 
connectors are found in consumer electronics as well as in cars 
and in military and medical technology, said it expected to 
report a profit of 34 to 37 cents for the second quarter, 
citing weak demand in the mobile phone business.  Revenue rose about 20 percent in the second quarter from a 
year ago, to $837.5 million, above the $836.7 million analysts 
had expected.  Currency translation added $18.6 million to the Lisle, 
Illinois-based company's revenue. Revenue also included $56.1 
million from Woodhead Industries, which Molex acquired last 
August. It said the integration of that business was on track 
and would be implemented in July.  For the third quarter, Molex expects earnings in the range 
of 32 to 36 cents a share on revenue in the range of $800 
million to $830 million. Analysts were expecting 34 cents a 
share, and $809.2 million.  Molex said it may revise its previously issued financial 
statements to reflect any adjustments related to its previously 
disclosed stock option misdating, but any adjustment is "not 
quantitatively material."  It estimated noncash adjustments related to the stock 
option misdating for grants to executive officers and employees 
since the beginning of 1995 at a loss of about $18 million 
after taxes.  That includes an amount to reflect charges based on recent 
Securities and Exchange Commission guidance, Molex said. The 
largest estimated impact due to option misdating in any one 
fiscal year is about $3.5 million after taxes in fiscal year 
2003.  Orders for the second quarter rose 10.7 percent to $778.7 
million, but down 9.9 percent from the prior quarter. The order 
backlog at the end of December was up 26.3 percent from the 
prior year to $375.9 million, but that was down 11.6 percent 
from the prior quarter.  Shares of Molex rose to $29.48 in after-hours electronic 
trading from its Thursday closing price of $29.40 on the 
Nasdaq.
