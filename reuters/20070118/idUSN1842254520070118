  (Recasts first paragraph, updates stock performance, adds analyst and CEO comment and byline)      By  James Kelleher       EAGLE RIVER, Wis., Jan 18 (Reuters) - Harley-Davidson Inc. ( HOG.N ) posted a nearly 10 percent rise in quarterly earnings Thursday thanks to strong international sales of its rumbling, iconic motorcycles, as well as market share gains in the United States.      The results are the latest sign that Harley is finding new customers even as the American baby boomers who have been its traditional buyer begin to get too old to ride.      Craig Kennison, an analyst at R.W. Baird, called the results "a solid quarter" and credited a number of factors for the improvement, including a 6.1 percent jump in average selling prices as customers gravitated toward more expensive, custom-outfitted bikes.      Fourth-quarter net profit rose to $252.4 million, or 97 cents a share, from $230 million, or 84 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose nearly 12 percent to $1.5 billion.   Analysts, on average, expected the Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based company to earn 96 cents a share on sales of $1.45 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.      During a conference call with analysts, Jim Ziemer, the company's chief executive, said the especially strong overseas sales represented the fruition of a program Harley undertook in recent years in places like Germany, getting rid of underperforming dealers.      "We saw great growth, double-digit growth, in our international markets last year and we're seeing it again this year," he said. "This is the result of things we've been putting in place the last three or four years. It's just didn't suddenly happen."      Since July, when the company introduced four new bikes and a powerful new powertrain at a dealer meeting in California, Harley shares have risen about 40 percent. The stock was down $1.64, or 2.25 percent, to $71.20 near midday on the New York Stock Exchange.      The company said worldwide retail sales of its motorcycles rose 6.4 percent during the fourth quarter. Sales in the United States, by far its largest and most important market, rose 0.3 percent, even as the overall domestic market for heavyweight motorcycles fell 1.7 percent.          Sales jumped 29.4 percent in international markets, driven by strong gains in Canada, Europe and Japan.      Looking forward, Harley said it expects to ship 82,000 to 84,000 motorcycles in the current quarter and reiterated its forecast for annual earnings-per-share growth of 11 percent to 17 percent through 2009.
