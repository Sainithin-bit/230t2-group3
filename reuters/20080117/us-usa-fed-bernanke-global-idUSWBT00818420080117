 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Thursday that Europe and Asia were unlikely to see as significant an economic slowdown as the United States. 

 "We do not see in Asia or in Europe the slowdown in growth that potentially we'll be seeing here in the United States," Bernanke told the House of Representatives Budget Committee. Bernanke noted that, unlike the United States, Europe did not suffer a two-year housing market decline. (Reporting by  Emily Kaiser ; Editing by  Jonathan Oatis )
