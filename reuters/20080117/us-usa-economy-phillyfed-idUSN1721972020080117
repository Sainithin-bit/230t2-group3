 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Factory activity in the Mid-Atlantic region contracted dramatically in January, reinforcing fears of recession, a survey showed on Thursday. 

 The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank said its business activity index took a huge dive to negative 20.9 in January from minus 1.6 in December, far below even the most pessimistic Wall Street forecasts. "You're seeing Northeastern manufacturers suffer a sharp drop in demand," said Pierre Ellis, senior economist at Decision Economics in New York. It was a second straight month of retrenchment, denoted by readings below zero. It was also the largest one-month drop since January 2001, just as the economy was on the cusp of its last recession. The figures would likely add to speculation economic growth is at risk over the coming months, particularly since both consumer spending and business investment appear to be softening simultaneously. Both the Federal Reserve and the federal government have vowed to act aggressively to fend off a prolonged slump. Fed chief Ben Bernanke said on Thursday he supported efforts in Congress to devise a fiscal stimulus package that might cushion the economic blow. The U.S. central bank is expected to slash benchmark interest rates by at least a half percentage point at its next monetary policy meeting, which takes place on Jan 29-30. Wall Street gave up early gains and turned sharply negative, extending a severe selloff this week. Bond prices surged as investors sought a safe haven. (Editing by  James Dalgleish )
