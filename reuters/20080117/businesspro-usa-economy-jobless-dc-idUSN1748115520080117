 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The number of workers filing initial 
claims for U.S. jobless benefits fell unexpectedly by 21,000 
last week, a government report showed on Thursday, in a report 
suggesting some improvement in the health of the labor market. 

  First-time claims for state unemployment insurance benefits 
fell for the third straight week, tumbling to 301,000 in the 
week ended January 12 from 322,000 for the prior week and to 
its lowest since September 22, the Labor Department said.  The fall in new claims defied a Wall Street forecast for a 
rise to 335,000 from the originally reported 322,000 in the 
week ended January 5.  The four-week moving average of new claims -- a better 
gauge of labor market trends because it irons out volatility in 
the week-to-week figures -- also fell sharply for the third 
straight week, dropping to 328,500 from 340,250 the prior week.  (Reporting by  Nancy Waitz ; Editing by Tom Hals)
