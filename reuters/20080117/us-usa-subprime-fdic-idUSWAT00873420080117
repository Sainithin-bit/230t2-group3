 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The chief of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp warned on Thursday that if industry solutions fail to help subprime mortgage borrowers, the odds of government involvement will increase. 

 With about 2 million subprime mortgages due to reset at sharply higher interest rates, FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair urged Wall Street to act quickly to help modify mortgages under a Treasury-backed industry plan because time is of the essence. "I very much believe in the market," Bair said in remarks prepared for a Bear Stearns investor conference in New York. "But if market solutions fail to solve the problem, government will step in." Without giving any details, Bair said regulatory measures may be needed to bring greater transparency. Regulators may want to further review capital requirements for structured financings based on external ratings, she said. (Reporting by  John Poirier , editing by Richard Chang)
