 CLEVELAND  (Reuters) - Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank President Sandra Pianalto said on Thursday the economy has shifted to a lower growth track and that she is concerned about downside risks to an already weak outlook. 

 Although inflation prospects have flared up recently, lower growth should help tamp down prices over time, Pianalto told the Association for Corporate Growth's Cleveland chapter. The Fed's 4th District president said the troika of high energy prices, falling equities prices and, especially, the weak housing market have combined to undercut consumer spending and overall growth, "The residential real estate market still appears to be in freefall," she said, on a day when U.S. housing starts for December were reported to have fallen to the lowest pace in more than 16 years. "Although I expect that the restraining influences to growth will diminish over time, and that the economy will gain firmer traction later this year and into 2009, I am concerned about the downside risks to that outlook." Pianalto is a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee in 2008. Thursday's remarks were her first on the economy in three months. Pianalto said conditions had deteriorated since the December FOMC meeting, a trend underlined by weak December payrolls growth. "We are also seeing a related slowing in consumer spending, perhaps in response to reduced household wealth. Tightened credit market conditions could also hinder economic growth this year for both businesses and consumers," she said. Even as the economy falters, there is a risk that the public's confidence in the Fed's commitment to price stability will be shaken, said Pianalto, who said she would be closely monitoring inflation expectations. Part of the recent rise in energy prices were passing through to core inflation, and the falling dollar seems to have boosted import prices as well, she said. Still, "I continue to believe that the economy's inflation trend will move lower over the forecast horizon as the growth rate of the economy slows and the influence of energy and import prices diminishes," she added. "Overall these comments are pretty dovish for the voting hawk, focused mainly on risks to growth," strategists at Action Economics said of Pianalto's remarks. The FOMC meets to discuss its next move on interest rates on January 29-30, and is widely expected to lower benchmark rates by one-half basis point, to 3.75 percent. Echoing a series of recent comments by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, Pianalto said the current "fluid" economic and financial environment created the need for policy-makers to be "highly flexible." Pianalto said the Fed and other agencies missed a "perfect storm" which culminated in the subprime mortgage blowup that many economists feel has pulled the economy to the brink of recession. A Reuters poll of economists taken over the past week says the U.S. economy faces a 45-percent chance of recession. "What we missed was the way that all these elements would end up in a perfect storm," she said. "There's a lot of blame to go around." Still, such asset bubbles are difficult to spot except in hindsight, and even harder to target with the "broad-based, blunt instrument" that is monetary policy, she said. Pianalto said she was not troubled "at the current time" by the huge infusions of capital that U.S. banks and other financial institutions are receiving from overseas. She termed the years-long decline in the U.S. dollar "orderly," but said it was unclear that the benefits to domestic manufacturers from a weaker dollar were as clear-cut now as in the past because so many materials are sourced from overseas.
