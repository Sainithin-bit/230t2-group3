 PHILADELPHIA  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Richard Fisher said on Thursday that recent inflation data was "not encouraging" and the central bank must be aware of keeping inflation expectations intact. 

 "We have responsibility, and one is to not plant seeds of inflation," he told reporters, even as he endorsed further monetary easing to support the economy. Fisher is a voting member on the Fed's rate-setting committee this year. The Federal Open Market Committee will hold its next meeting on January 29-30, at which it is widely expected to cut the benchmark federal funds rate by half a percentage point.
