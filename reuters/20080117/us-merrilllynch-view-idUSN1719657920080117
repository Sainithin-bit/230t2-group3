 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Merrill Lynch & Co Inc on Thursday said it took a $14.1 billion write-down in the fourth quarter on bad subprime mortgage bets, plus other charges, which have forced the brokerage to sell pieces of the company to foreign investors to raise capital. 

 Merrill Lynch reported a fourth-quarter net loss of $9.8 billion, or $12.01 a share, the largest in the company's history. That eclipses the company's $2.3 billion loss in the previous quarter. Market Reaction: Equity index futures fell, with the S&P contract turning negative after having been up overnight; benchmark 10-year treasury notes edged up, pushing yields to session lows, and the dollar fell against the yen and euro. European stock markets turned lower as well. Merrill Lynch shares were down 3.6 percent in electronic premarket trading in the U.S. Merrill Lynch's Frankfurt-traded shares fell to 36.6 euros after the release of the results for a loss of 2.9 percent compared to Wednesday's close in Frankfurt. The following is reactions from industry analysts: PAUL FENNER-LEITAO, CREDIT ANALYST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL,  LONDON "It looks as if over last 24 hours the rating agencies have restarted a review of financial guarantors and this is a new set of risks which people have not been anticipating. "A new and enhanced rating risk for guarantors of downgrades there presents more financial risk for the banks. It looks as if Merrill has taken an incremental markdown against one of financial guarantors that went sub-investment grade" ANGUS CAMPBELL, HEAD OF SALES AT CAPITAL SPREADS, LONDON "By now, people are starting to actually realize how far these things go," said "Things aren't good. Earnings for banks are going to be hit hard this year. (But) what they (banks) are managing to do is attract funding from elsewhere and we've seen Citi do that. So if there are people willing to still fund these banks then it looks unlikely there will be any dividend cuts, which is encouraging for investors. There is still confidence in the banks and you're seeing the banking stocks in London actually benefiting from that at the moment. Hopefully we're out of the woods, but it's still not completely clear." PETER BOOCKVAR, EQUITY STRATEGIST, MILLER TABAK & CO., NEW  YORK: "The loss seems higher-than-expected. The writedown, I guess was large, about in line. But we knew that it was going to be bad." Asked if the latest writedowns meant the company was wiping the slate clean, he said: "Prices (on mortgage related securities) continue to drop. So yeah, the slate is clean for today, but prices continue to drop. It's just marking to market." (Reporting by  Ellis Mnyandu  in New York and Michael Taylor in London, Andrew Hurst in Zurich)
