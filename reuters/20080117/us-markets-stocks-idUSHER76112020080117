 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Stocks fell on Thursday as data showing a sharp contraction in regional factory and news of a hefty loss by brokerage Merrill Lynch fanned worries about the economy and a weakening financial sector. 

 The S&P 500 index and the Dow industrials fell more than 1 percent. Merrill Lynch & Co Inc MER.N, the world's largest brokerage, reported a larger-than-expected net loss for the fourth quarter. Its shares fell 6 percent to $51.79.  The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank report, which showed activity in the mid-Atlantic region contracted more than expected in January, offset optimism about earlier data showing a drop in weekly jobless claims. It was the biggest monthly drop in the index of business conditions since January 2001. "Philly Fed was lower-than-expected. It kind of shocked the market. But at this point people are talking about what's priced into the market and what's not," said Cleveland Rueckert at Birinyi Associates Inc. in Stamford, Connecticut, The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was down 132.10 points, or 1.06 percent, at 12,334.06. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was down 19.59 points, or 1.43 percent, at 1,353.61. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was down 16.83 points, or 0.70 percent, at 2,377.76. Analysts said Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's testimony to a congressional committee largely repeated the Fed chief's concerns about the economy voiced last week. Pharmaceutical shares also were among top decliners on the S&P 500. Merck & Co Inc ( MRK.N ) and Schering-Plough Corp SGP.N were hurt by problems in a clinical trial of their shared cholesterol fighter, vytorin. Merck was down 3.4 percent at $56.35, while Schering was down 2.4 percent at $22.92. (Additional reporting by  Ellis Mnyandu ; Editing by Kenneth Barry)
