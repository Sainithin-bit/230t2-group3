 BASEL, Switzerland  (Reuters) - Swiss drugmaker Novartis AG ( NOVN.VX ) missed forecasts with a 42 percent drop in fourth-quarter net profit, hit by generic competition and a one-off restructuring charge, sending its shares lower. 

 Novartis, Europe's second-largest pharmaceuticals company by market capitalization, said on Thursday its fourth-quarter profit fell to $931 million and also announced its largest share buyback yet, worth 10 billion Swiss francs ($9.20 billion). Novartis shares fell 3.1 percent to 59.35 francs by 4:20 a.m. EST, bucking a firmer trend on the Swiss Market Index. It was the top European blue-chip loser in a stronger overall market. "Results are significantly below expectations," said Karl-Heinz Koch, an analyst at Vontobel. "The big disappointment comes from pharma and that raises questions about whether they will meet their future estimates." The company's problems are similar to much of the pharmaceuticals industry, which faces declining sales of franchises, a lack of significant new drugs, increasing generic competition and tougher regulatory hurdles. Novartis suffered a series of setbacks in 2007, including delays to important drugs like Galvus for diabetes and the withdrawal of bowel treatment Zelnorm in the United States. It cut 2.5 percent of its workforce, aiming for annual savings of $1.6 billion in 2010, and taking a charge of $450 million in the fourth quarter for the measures. The group had been expected to post net profit of $1.48 billion in the fourth quarter. It broadly maintained its existing outlook, saying it expected group sales to rise at a mid single-digit rate in 2008, with drugs sales increasing at a low single-digit rate. It proposed a 2007 dividend of 1.60 francs, up 19 percent. "We have to reduce our earnings estimates," said DZ Bank analyst Peter Spengler. "This will have a negative impact on our fair value. Our rating is under review." EARLY 2008 SLOWDOWN Novartis still sees a slowdown in early 2008, but an improvement later in the year as negative factors wash out. "Looking forward, one has to expect that the first quarter will be weak due to pharmaceuticals; the second quarter neutral; third quarter positive and fourth quarter very positive," Novartis Chief Executive Daniel Vasella told reporters. Vasella said Novartis may opt not to carry out a new late-stage trial for Galvus -- needed to gain U.S. approval -- depending on the ultimate possibility of success. "It's absolutely on the cards that we will file; it's absolutely on the cards that we will not file," he said. Shares in Novartis lost 12 percent of their value in 2007, in line with the DJ Stoxx European drugs sector index .SXDP. Its shares trade at about 15 times forecast 2008 earnings, according to Reuters data, just behind local rival Roche Holding AG ( ROG.VX ) but ahead of other European drug majors, GlaxoSmithKline Plc ( GSK.L ), Sanofi-Aventis ( SASY.PA ) and AstraZeneca Plc ( AZN.L ).
