 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Bush administration and Congress are discussing a possible economic stimulus package that would cost around $100 billion to $150 billion, House of Representatives Republican leader John Boehner said on Thursday. 

 "There's been some conversation about somewhere between $100 (billion) to $150 billion as the overall size of the package that has been discussed at the White House and up here," the Ohio congressman told reporters when asked if there was an "upper limit" to the cost of such legislation. Congressional leaders and U.S. President George W. Bush are scheduled to hold a telephone conversation about such legislation later on Thursday. While he provided reporters with a possible range for the size of a stimulus plan, Boehner added that there is "no firm number" yet on its potential cost. Boehner repeated remarks he made on Wednesday, saying Republicans wanted to work cooperatively with Democrats on a stimulus bill and that Congress needs to act "quickly." The top House Republican spoke to reporters as Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke testified to the U.S. House of Representatives Budget Committee that he supported efforts in Congress to write stimulus legislation.
