 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Merrill Lynch & Co Inc. Chief Executive John Thain said there will be no dramatic layoffs at the company even in the face of billions of dollars of losses. 

 Thain said on a conference call that he would not be targeting "thousands and thousands of people." Instead, selective cuts will be made, in areas such as structured credit and mortgage origination. Thain earlier said the company will move away from trades that are balance sheet intensive and it will move illiquid assets into third-party funds.
