 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. President George W. Bush will not include a push to extend his 2001 and 2003 tax cuts in an upcoming proposal for an economic stimulus, the White House said on Thursday. 

 "The president supports a permanent extension of his tax cuts, and he supports a short-term growth package, but they are separate," said White House spokesman Tony Fratto. The decision to leave the prior tax cuts out of the debate may improve the likelihood for a deal between Bush and the Democratic-led Congress on a stimulus plan. Democrats have rejected Bush's efforts to extend the tax cuts. (Reporting by  Caren Bohan ; editing by Gary Crosse)
