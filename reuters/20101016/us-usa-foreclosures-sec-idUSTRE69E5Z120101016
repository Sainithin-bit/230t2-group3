 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Securities and Exchange Commission is looking at companies' mortgage practices to see whether any securities laws were violated, a person with knowledge of the matter said. 

 The probe is very preliminary, and is not targeting particular companies at this stage, the person said. The SEC was not immediately available to comment. (Reporting by  Rachelle Younglai ; Writing by  Dan Wilchins ; Editing by  Gary Hill )
