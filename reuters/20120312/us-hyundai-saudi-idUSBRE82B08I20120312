 SEOUL  (Reuters) - South Korea's Hyundai Engineering & Construction Co Ltd said on Monday that it has been awarded an about $1.5 billion order to build an alumina refinery in Saudi Arabia. 
 Hyundai said in a regulatory filing that it would carry out engineering, procurement, construction and pre-commissioning work for the 1.8 million-tonne-per-year refinery, confirming an earlier announcement by Saudi Arabia's state-run Maaden. (Reporting by Ju-min Park; Editing by Chris Lewis)
