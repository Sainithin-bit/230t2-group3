 SEOUL  (Reuters) - South Korea's benchmark KOSPI index fell on Monday, weighed by concerns of an economic slowdown in China and as bullish signs from a strong U.S. jobs data were outweighed as expectations of further easing from the Federal Reserve were pushed back. 
 Cyclical shares fell across the board, as Samsung Heavy Industries ( 010140.KS ), South Korea's third-largest shipbuilder, slid 3.73 percent while Hyundai Steel ( 004020.KS ) dipped 3.77 percent. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI)  .KS11  declined 0.78 percent to close at 2,002.50 points. (Reporting by Joonhee Yu; Editing by  David Chance )
