 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Home improvement chain Lowe's Cos ( LOW.N ) will focus on boosting margins and market share in the coming year rather than bet on a U.S. economy plagued by high unemployment. 

 The company posted lower-than-expected quarterly sales and forecast a tepid full-year profit, but increased gross margin by 85 basis points and gained share from market leader Home Depot ( HD.N ) in some product categories like appliances, tools and outdoor power equipment in the third quarter. Lowe's executives said they will focus on these products and other margin growth initiatives, like offering more private label goods, as they wait for the economy to perk up. In an interview, Chief Executive Robert Niblock said he expects a gradual recovery in demand for home goods. He sees the second half of 2011 outperforming the first, but expects robust sales growth for the home improvement industry only in 2012. "There is gradual improvement out there. We are starting to grow jobs again, just not fast enough to pull unemployment down," Niblock said by phone, adding," We just don't expect that big macroenvironment to kick in  a meaningful way for our industry until... closer to 2012." Lowe's sees operating margin, or earnings before interest and taxes as a percentage of sales, rising 50 to 60 basis points in the current fiscal year. The company said it installed new inventory management software to help individual stores keep better track of prices and said it was making structural changes to become more competitive on prices on a local level. Lowe's will shed more light on its new initiatives in a meeting later this month. Such efforts could also give Lowe's an edge over its larger rival going forward, some analysts said. "Lowe's tools to extract efficiencies is slowly steering the debate in its favor," Wall Street Strategies analyst Brian Sozzi said. Lowe's shares were up 0.8 percent at $21.86 on Monday after touching an intraday high of $22.48. Home Depot, due to report quarterly results on Tuesday, rose about 1.2 percent. In what may prove a more hopeful sign for the economy, sales at U.S. retailers rose more than expected in October to post their largest gain in seven months, boosted by purchases of motor vehicles and building materials, according to Commerce Department data. Sales at Lowe's rose 1.9 percent to $11.59 billion, but missed the average estimate of $11.75 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales at stores open at least a year rose 0.2 percent. "Sales (at Lowe's) were a little light, but I don't think that's surprising," said Barclays analyst Michael Lasser, citing recent commentary on softness in housing-related products from other retailers as home prices remain weak. The company said net income rose to $404 million, or 29 cents a share, in the third quarter ended October 29 from $344 million, or 23 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the profit was 31 cents a share, while analysts on average were expecting 30 cents. For the full year, the company forecast earnings of $1.37 to $1.40 a share, while analysts on average were expecting $1.41. It expects sales to rise 2 percent to 4 percent.
