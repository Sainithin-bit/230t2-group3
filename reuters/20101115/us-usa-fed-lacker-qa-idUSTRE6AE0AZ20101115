 RICHMOND, Virginia  (Reuters) - It is unfair to claim the Federal Reserve is easing monetary policy in order to weaken the U.S. dollar and boost exports, Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker said on Sunday. 

 "To say that this is aimed at reducing the dollar is unfair," he said. "To call it manipulation is grossly unfair." Lacker added that the Fed has the tools it needs to withdraw monetary stimulus when the time is right. "The tricky part is figuring out when and how fast," he said.
