 MELBOURNE/TORONTO  (Reuters) - Global miner BHP Billiton failed in its $39 billion bid for fertilizer maker Potash Corp, despite offering more than $1 billion worth of concessions to try to win approval from Canada. 

 Following are the key undertakings BHP offered: * Remain in Canpotex -- the export arm of Potash Corp, Mosaic and Agrium -- for five years. * $450 million exploration and development investment over the next five years, over and above spending already planned on BHP's own Jansen potash project in Saskatchewan province. Jansen is set to be the world's biggest potash mine. * $370 million additional spending on infrastructure funds in Saskatchewan and New Brunswick provinces. * Commitment to forego certain tax benefits. Saskatchewan estimated the province stood to lose between C$3 billion to C$6 billion ($2.96-$5.93 billion) over 10 years in taxes and potash royalties if the takeover had proceeded. * Move more than 200 jobs from outside Canada to Saskatchewan and Vancouver. * Maintain current job levels at Potash Corp's Canadian mines for five years and increase overall employment in Canadian potash businesses by 15 percent in that time. * $250 million performance bond to ensure the company fulfilled its undertakings. * $8 million a year in spending on community programs, mainly in Saskatchewan and New Brunswick. * Investment in the University of Saskatchewan.
