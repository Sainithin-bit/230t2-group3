 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar climbed to a six-week high against major currencies on Monday as worries about Ireland's debt crisis persisted, hurting the euro, while rising U.S. bond yields increased the greenback's appeal. 

 Global equity markets ended little changed to slightly lower as concerns the Federal Reserve may scale back efforts to stimulate the economy muted optimism over two big takeover bids. A rise in the 10-year U.S. Treasury note's yield to a three-month high also buoyed the dollar, as bond investors unwound positions taken in advance of the Federal Reserve's second program of long-term purchases of government debt. Concerns about Ireland's ability to repay its debt and that its problems may spread throughout the euro zone rekindled the dollar's appeal as a safe-haven. "The euro fell below $1.36 and is set to remain under pressure in the near term as investors focused on fiscal troubles in Ireland and Portugal and await meetings of European finance ministers on Tuesday and Wednesday," said Greg Farinella, managing director and head of Treasury and trading at Espirito Santo Investment S.A. in New York. "The issues in Europe have been very focal the last couple of days and that's lending itself to euro weakness." News that a group of Republican economists and financial services executives will launch a campaign this week urging the Fed to drop the plan to buy $600 billion of Treasuries spurred a rise in government bond yields and boosted the dollar. Helping to motivate the sell-off in U.S. debt was the rationale that the economy could improve soon, making further large-scale asset purchases by the Fed -- after the $600 billion it committed to buy at its November policy meeting -- unnecessary. The rise in U.S. yields has enhanced the appeal of dollar-denominated assets. The U.S. Dollar Index .DXY, which measures the dollar's performance against a basket of major currencies, rose 0.69 percent to 78.619 after earlier rising as high as 78.629. It has now recouped all losses made after the Fed's November 3 announcement of a second round of quantitative easing. The euro fell 0.77 percent to $1.3585, while the dollar gained 0.82 percent to 83.28 yen, touching a five-week high as U.S. Treasury yields surged. Investors sold the euro as Ireland struggled to convince them it was in control of its debt problems, leaving open the possibility of a bailout. [ID:nLDE68T0MG] The euro has taken a hit in the past week as Irish bond yields have jumped on the country's struggles to control its spiraling debt. The debt-laden country is fully funded for 2010, but Irish press reports said on Monday it was considering asking for money for its banks, and other European governments were keen to avoid a contagion to other peripheral countries. "A lot of this is going to depend on how severe this whole euro-zone crisis becomes. Everybody is really focused on the Wednesday meeting with euro-zone finance ministers," said Boris Schlossberg, director of currency research at GFT in New York. "If they can't come up with some tangible resolution to the Irish problem, then the dollar definitely gets the benefit risk-aversion flows," he added. U.S. data showed U.S. retailers' sales rose more than expected in October, suggesting the economic recovery was on track. But a separate report showed an index of manufacturing in New York state fell in November to its lowest since April 2009 after new orders and shipments tumbled. STOCKS LOSE STEAM U.S. stocks ended slightly lower as the energy and materials sectors, which are sensitive to commodity prices and weaken when the dollar rises, led the way down as the Treasury market sell-off picked up steam in the afternoon. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  ended up 9.39 points, or 0.08 percent, at 11,201.97. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  fell 1.46 points, or 0.12 percent, at 1,197.75. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  closed down 4.39 points, or 0.17 percent, at 2,513.82. M&A activity kept the market afloat for most of the day after Caterpillar Inc ( CAT.N ) agreed to buy mining equipment maker Bucyrus International Inc BUCY.O for $7.6 billion and data storage equipment maker EMC Corp ( EMC.N ) inked a deal to buy smaller rival Isilon Systems Inc ISLN.O for $2.25 billion. The FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3  of top European shares gained 0.75 percent after falling for three straight sessions. European stocks rallied on news that German truck maker MAN SE ( MANG.DE ) and Sweden's Scania ( SCVb.ST ) were in talks over a possible merger, in a move that could result in Volkswagen ( VOWG.DE ) taking full control of both. The December futures contract for the Nikkei 225 stock index trading in Chicago fell 25 points to 9860. MSCI's all-country world stock index .MIWD00000PUS fell 0.1 percent. Persistent concerns that China will raise interest rates further also spurred selling of riskier assets as traders worried policy tightening will curb the robust demand of the  world's second-largest economy for commodities and other imports. The U.S. 30-year Treasury bond lost 2 points in late trading as dealers exited bets they had put on the Federal Reserve's $600 billion bond purchase program, dubbed QE2. The 30-year bond traded as low as 97-10/32 in price and its yield was as high as 4.41 percent, a level not seen since mid-May, according to Reuters data. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell 47/32, with the yield at 2.9575 percent. The 2-year U.S. Treasury note fell 2/32, with the yield at 0.5399 percent. The Fed on Monday bought $7.92 billion in Treasury debt maturing between September 2016 and November 2017. On Friday, the Fed bought $7.23 billion in Treasury paper maturing in four to six years. In energy and commodity markets, U.S. crude oil futures fell 26 cents, or 0.31 percent, to $84.62 per barrel, and spot gold fell $8.94, or 0.65 percent, to $1359.40 an ounce. Gold's drop from last week's record $1,424.10 an ounce was on concern the market had become overbought and as talk of a potential Chinese interest-rate rise knocked commodity prices sharply lower.
