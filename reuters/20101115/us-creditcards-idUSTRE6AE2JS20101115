 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Major U.S. credit-card lenders reported lower delinquency rates on Monday, as fewer Americans fell behind on payments, in another sign that the economic recovery is gaining momentum. 

 Lenders including Bank of America Corp, Citigroup Inc and American Express Co said the rate of late payments on their credit cards fell in October to the lowest level this year. Delinquencies are the first sign that consumers are having trouble paying their bills and indicators of future losses. The steady decline this year at the top U.S. credit-card lenders signals that American consumers have recovered from the worst of the financial crisis. "It's nice to see that consumers feel more confident in at least being able to pay their other bills," RBC Capital Markets analyst Jason Arnold said, adding that the October delinquency rates were slightly better than he had expected. "We still have a very slow recovery ahead of us, but it's encouraging to see the seasonal trends being overwhelmed by credit performance," he said. Credit quality usually worsens in the second half of the year, as consumers stop using tax refunds to pay down debt and start shopping for the holidays. The U.S. Commerce Department provided more positive evidence for the economy on Monday when it reported that sales at U.S. retailers rose more than expected in October. THE LONG ROAD BACK But uncertainty remains, as persistently high unemployment slows the rate of recovery at consumer lenders. Overall charge-off rates have fallen at most banks but remain high by historical standards. Loan portfolios are still shrinking, with consumers reluctant to take on new debt. Bank of America, for example, said in a regulatory filing on Monday that its charge-off rate inched back up above 10 percent in October, after falling to 9.99 percent in September. Bank of America, the largest U.S. consumer bank, still has the nation's worst credit-card loss rate, but it has dropped from more than 13 percent at the beginning of 2010. The company's delinquency rate in October fell to 5.60 percent from 5.71 percent. Lenders file monthly credit-card performance reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Citigroup said charge-offs rose to 10.27 percent in October, from 8.99 percent, largely due to a one-time accounting change. But its delinquency rate fell to 4.74 percent in October from 4.93 percent in September. At the other end of the spectrum, American Express continued to report the lowest level of charge-offs and delinquencies among the major U.S. lenders. The credit-card lender and transaction processing network said charge-offs was unchanged at 4.7 percent in October. Delinquencies fell to 2.3 percent from 2.5 percent in September. Like Discover Financial Services, American Express lends directly to consumers and competes with Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc to process credit-card transactions. The company is increasingly looking to its transaction-processing business for growth, and has cut back on lending to all but affluent consumers who mostly pay their bills in full every month. JPMorgan Chase & Co, which is increasingly competing with American Express for the most affluent credit card customers, said in a separate filing on Monday that its charge-off rate fell to 7.0 percent in October, from 7.78 percent in September. The bank's delinquency rate was unchanged at 3.81 percent the second-lowest at the top U.S. lenders. Discover's charge-off rate fell to 6.83 percent in October, from 7.15 percent in September. The company said its delinquency rate fell to 4.34 percent in October, from 4.41 percent in September. Capital One Financial Corp said charge-offs fell sharply in October, to 7.26 percent from 8.38 percent in September. The bank has reduced its loss rate from more than 10 percent at the beginning of the year. But Capital One's delinquency rate only improved slightly, falling to 4.45 percent from 4.53 a month earlier. Shares of Bank of America closed slightly down on Monday, while those of the other five rose. JPMorgan, Capital One and Discover all closed up more than 1 percent.
