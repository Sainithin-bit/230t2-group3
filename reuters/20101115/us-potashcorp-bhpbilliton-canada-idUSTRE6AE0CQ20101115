 TORONTO  (Reuters) - Canada said on Sunday it blocked BHP Billiton's bid for fertilizer giant Potash Corp partly because BHP, the world's top miner, lacked expertise in mining and marketing the crop nutrient. 

 Industry Minister Tony Clement said he was also not satisfied that the proposed $39 billion takeover would create a significant improvement in the level and nature of economic activity in Canada. "BHP Billiton is a large successful mining company, but they do not have comparable experience to PCS (Potash Corp of Saskatchewan) in the mining and marketing of potash," he told reporters in Toronto "My concern was that the successful bid could jeopardize the benefits that Canadians derive from the industry." Clement spoke after BHP formally scrapped its bid, the world's biggest deal this year, and bowed to calls from investors to return cash. Canada blocked BHP's bid for the world's largest fertilizer maker on November 3 and gave BHP a month to prove the takeover would benefit Canada. BHP said it would continue to pursue its Jansen potash project in Canada, which would be the world's biggest single potash mine. Clement, the minister responsible for ruling on the takeover, suggested the possibility BHP could have delayed Jansen's development if its bid succeeded may also have been a factor. "In a nutshell, we were concerned that the bid would mean that other capital expenditures may not be as forthcoming, so that the net impact would be negative rather than positive," he said. The expectation that BHP would exit potash marketing group Canpotex and run mines at full capacity was seen by many as another sticking point to a successful bid. Clement seemed to confirm this was the case. Potash Corp "has access already to infrastructure and a marketing system that allows it to sell throughout the globe," Clement said. "Certainly nothing in the plans and undertakings, or not to the extent necessary, that BHP was willing to give indicated that that would be enhanced by their proposed investment."
