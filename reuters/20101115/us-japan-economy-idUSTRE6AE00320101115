 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's economic growth accelerated in the third quarter as expiring government stimulus steps gave consumption a last-minute boost, marking an upward blip in a moderate slowdown that is leading the economy to a standstill. 

 Many analysts expect the economy to stall, or even contract slightly, in the next two quarters as the strong yen's damage to exports becomes more evident and factory output slumps after stimulus measures for low-emission cars expired in September. While few expect Japan to slip back into recession, policymakers remain alert for risks to the fragile economy. Should a renewed yen rise add to the woes dragging on growth, the Bank of Japan may ease monetary policy further to avoid a prolonged downturn. "Third-quarter growth relied heavily on domestic demand, and this suggests a marked slowdown in the final quarter as stimulus-driven consumption loses steam and export growth slows," said Junko Nishioka, chief Japan economist at RBS Securities. Japan's gross domestic product (GDP) grew 0.9 percent in July-September from the previous quarter, accelerating from a 0.4 percent gain in the second quarter and beating a median forecast for a 0.6 percent rise, Cabinet Office data showed on Monday. The fourth straight quarter of expansion translates into an annualized gain of 3.9 percent, nearly double the rate of U.S. growth marked in the same period. OUTLOOK THREATENED The government saw little to cheer about, with Economics Minister Banri Kaieda warning that slowing overseas growth and the strong yen could threaten the outlook. "Japan's economy is at a standstill with weakness in production," he said in a statement issued after the data. Japan emerged from its worst recession since World War Two in the second quarter of 2009, but growth has been spotty due to a lackluster labor market and slow gains in corporate spending. A Reuters poll showed the economy will likely shrink 0.1 percent in October-December as the effects of government stimulus fade, before resuming a moderate recovery. Underscoring the pain inflicted by the strong yen and slowing exports, net external demand -- or exports minus imports -- made no contribution to third-quarter GDP after adding 0.3 percentage point in April-June. Private consumption, which accounts for about 60 percent of the economy, rose 1.1 percent, the biggest increase in more than a year, due to the one-off boost from expiring incentives for low-emission cars and a looming tobacco tax hike in October that prompted an 11th-hour buying binge. Japan's powerful lower house of parliament is expected to pass on Monday a 5 trillion-yen ($61 billion) extra budget but analysts doubt that the modest package will give much of a boost to the economy. That leaves the onus on the BOJ, although it feels less pressure to ease now with the yen having weakened somewhat after its ascent near record-high levels last month. "The yen has fallen a bit but you can't disregard the risks of further yen rises due to U.S. monetary easing," said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute. "That will add pressure on the Bank of Japan to ease policy further as there's limited room for the government to boost fiscal spending." The BOJ last eased its policy early in October by setting a new interest rate target in a 0-0.1 percent range, pledging to keep rates effectively pegged at zero until the end of deflation was in sight, and announcing an asset buying scheme. The central bank has said it stands ready to expand monetary policy further by boosting the size of the asset buying fund, if economic conditions deteriorate.
