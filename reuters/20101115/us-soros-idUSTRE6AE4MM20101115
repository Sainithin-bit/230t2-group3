 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Billionaire investor George Soros in the third quarter reduced some of his big bets on gold, a market he has called "the ultimate bubble." 

 In a quarterly securities filing on Monday, Soros Fund Management reported it owned 4.7 million shares of the SPDR Gold Trust ( GLD.P ) at the end of the third quarter, down from 5.2 million at the end of June. Soros also trimmed positions in miners including Barrick Gold ( ABX.TO ), Great Basin Gold GBG.TO and Newmont Mining ( NEM.N ). He held unchanged large positions in NovaGold Resources ( NG.TO ) and Kinross Gold ( K.TO ). However, he call options on 705,000 shares of the SPDR Gold fund. Soros has said several times this year that gold is "the ultimate bubble." "I called gold the ultimate bubble which means it may go higher," Soros explained in September at a Reuters Newsmaker event in New York. "But it's certainly not safe and it's not going to last forever." Since hitting an all-time record of $1,424.10 an ounce last week, the price of gold has slipped. Spot gold was trading around $1,359 an ounce on Monday and U.S. gold futures for December delivery settled at $1,368.50. Soros does not typically explain his quarter-to-quarter moves. A spokesman was not immediately available for comment. Money managers like Soros are required to file form 13-F within 45 days after the end of each quarter. The forms include only U.S.-listed equity securities and related derivatives. Bonds, other securities and short positions are typically not disclosed. Managers may also leave off U.S.-listed equities they own under certain circumstances or file some holdings on confidential filings. (Reporting by  Aaron Pressman ; Editing by Phil Berlowitz)
