 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Yum Brands Inc ( YUM.N ) will cut "several hundred" jobs as it sells company-owned KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants to franchisees and restructures its U.S. business, a spokesman for the fast-food chain said on Wednesday. 

 The Louisville, Kentucky-based company plans to reduce the percentage of Pizza Hut and KFC restaurants it owns to 10 percent from 20 percent through unit sales to franchisees. The company will continue to own 20 percent of all Taco Bell outlets. "As we restructure, we are eliminating some positions and in addition to that, we're shifting some positions from Yum to our brands," spokesman Jonathan Blum said. He said up to 200 positions will be shifted from Yum to the company's brands. Several hundred other jobs will be eliminated across the company's campuses in Louisville, Dallas, and Irvine, California, Blum said. In addition, several hundred jobs supporting company-owned restaurants will be eliminated as outlets are sold to franchisees. Blum said the actions would result in "several hundred" net job losses.
