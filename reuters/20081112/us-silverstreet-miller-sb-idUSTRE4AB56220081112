 LONDON  (Reuters) - High profile fund manager Alan Miller, the former New Star chief investment officer hired by SilverStreet Capital, may set up a fund to invest in "immense" opportunities in convertible and high-yield bonds. Miller, who ran equity long/short hedges fund at Jupiter and New Star, told Reuters that asset management firm SilverStreet may set up a portfolio to invest directly in bonds -- where deleveraging by hedge funds has created "pockets of incredible value" -- although the structure had not yet been decided. "I think opportunities are on the bond side rather than the equity side ... Specific areas are a once-in-a 20 or 30-year opportunity," he said. "There are pockets ... where, if you started with a blank sheet of paper, you could create portfolios with amazing prospects ... Prices have come down quite dramatically. It's more a reflection of hedge fund deleveraging than fundamentals." His comments come as the shrinking hedge fund industry finds itself forced to sell convertibles and other bonds to meet heavy client redemptions. 

 Such selling has pushed down the convertible bonds market by around 45 percent since September. "In equities probably a lot of the fall has been matched by earnings downgrades," he said. "On the bond side there has been an equal fall, the risk of defaults has increased but at least that has been substantially priced in." He said the firm had not decided what type of structure it might use to buy these bonds, but said that "a lot of money has come out of that area. You may be better off starting clean so you can pick and choose, rather than investing in an old fund." Miller also said he did not plan to run an equity long/short hedge fund again because of "the thought of staring at the screen and watching prices move and getting stressed for every day of the year." Miller, a founding shareholder of New Star, left the firm last year by mutual consent following a sabbatical after losing a House of Lords appeal against a 5 million pound ($7.73 million) payment to his former wife in a high-profile divorce.
