 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Wednesday held a briefing on the government's financial rescue package. 

 Following are highlights of his remarks. ON CHANGING STRATEGY "I will never apologize for changing an approach or strategy when the facts change." ON PLAN FOR ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES LIQUIDITY FACILITY "These things are complicated, so this will take in my judgment weeks to design and then it will take longer to get going. In terms of the size, decisions have not been made. This could be of significant size. It will need to be significant to make a difference." ON EXPANDING TARP BEYOND FEDERALLY REGULATED BANKS "What we are doing right now, we are ... making it available to banks and thrifts that have a federal regulator and that is where the focus is right now. If we go beyond that, there are certain advantages to going beyond it and there are implementation difficulties." ON AID FOR AUTOMAKERS "I believe the auto industry is important, critical industry in the country. We are very supportive of manufacturing. So again, it's a critical industry, manufacturing is critical to the country. Our position all the way along is that any solution is going to be a solution leading to viability. Any solution will be leading to long-term viability. What you have heard the administration say so far is that the 136, which is the $25 billion set aside for the auto sector, one option would be to amend that bill to make money available." "I have said very clearly we need a solution but the solution has got to be one that leads to viability ... and again ... the intent of the TARP was to deal with the financial industry." ON FDIC PROPOSAL ON FORECLOSURE MITIGATION "When we look at the program you're mentioning, the FDIC program ... we're continuing to discuss and work through (it). But that is a subsidy or spending program" while TARP is an investment program. ON WHETHER $700 BILLION PACKAGE LARGE ENOUGH "I still am comfortable with $700 billion." NOT ASKING FOR FINAL TRANCHE FROM $700 BILLION YET "I have no timeline for going to Congress to ask for the drawdown of the second $350." ON DECISION TO BACK AWAY FROM ASSET PURCHASES "Over these past weeks we have continued to examine the relative benefits of purchasing illiquid mortgage-related assets. Our assessment at this time is that this is not the most effective way to use TARP funds, but we will continue to examine whether targeted forms of asset purchase can play a useful role, relative to other potential uses of TARP resources, in helping to strengthen our financial system and support lending." ON CAPITAL NEEDS "Although the financial system has stabilized, both banks and non-banks may well need more capital given their troubled asset holdings, projections for continued high rates of foreclosures and stagnant U.S. and world economic conditions." DESIGNING A PROGRAM THAT ATTRACTS PRIVATE CAPITAL "... we are designing further strategies for building capital in financial institutions. Stronger capital positions will enable financial institutions to better manage the illiquid assets on their books and better ensure that they remain healthy. Any future program should maintain our principle of encouraging participation of healthy institutions while protecting taxpayers. We are carefully evaluating programs which would further leverage the impact of a TARP investment by attracting private capital, potentially through matching investments. In developing a potential matching program, we will also consider capital needs of non-bank financial institutions not eligible for the current capital program; broadening access in this way would bring both benefits and challenges." POSSIBLE FACILITY FOR AAA ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES "With the Federal Reserve we are exploring the development of a potential liquidity facility for highly-rated AAA asset-backed securities. We are looking at ways to possibly use the TARP to encourage private investors to come back to this troubled market, by providing them access to federal financing while protecting the taxpayers' investment. By doing so, we can lower costs and increase credit availability for consumers. Addressing the needs of the securitization sector will help get lending going again, helping consumers and supporting the U.S. economy. While this securitization effort is targeted at consumer financing, the program we are evaluating may also be used to support new commercial and residential mortgage-backed securities lending." FORECLOSURE MITIGATION EFFORTS "... we are examining strategies to mitigate mortgage foreclosures. In crafting the financial rescue package, we and the Congress agreed that Treasury would use its leverage as a major purchaser of troubled mortgages to work with servicers and achieve more aggressive mortgage modification standards. Now that we are not planning to purchase illiquid mortgage assets, we must find another way to meet that commitment." "... there has been significant work to design and evaluate a number of proposals to induce further modifications. Each of these would, however, require substantial government subsidies." "As we evaluate the merits of any new proposal, we also will have to identify and justify the means to finance it. We must be careful to distinguish this type of assistance, which essentially involves direct spending, from the type of investments that are intended to promote financial stability, protect the taxpayer, and be recovered under the TARP legislation." ON GOVERNMENT BACKING FOR FANNIE MAE, FREDDIE MAC "Eight weeks ago, Treasury took responsibility for supporting the agency debt securities and the agency MBS through a preferred stock purchase agreement that guarantees a positive net worth in each enterprise -- effectively, a guarantee on GSE debt and agency MBS. We also established a credit facility to provide the GSEs the strongest possible liquidity backstop. As the enterprises go through this difficult housing correction we will, as needed and promised, purchase preferred shares under the terms of that agreement. The U.S. government honors its commitments, and investors can bank on it."
