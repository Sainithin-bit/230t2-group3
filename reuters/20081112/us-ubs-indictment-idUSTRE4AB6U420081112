 MIAMI  (Reuters) - The head of UBS AG's wealth management business, Raoul Weil, has been charged with conspiring to help thousands of wealthy Americans hide $20 billion of assets from U.S. tax authorities in Swiss bank accounts. 

 The indictment, a major escalation of a U.S. investigation into Switzerland's biggest bank, was unsealed on Wednesday. It said Weil had been charged with concealing the assets of about 17,000 U.S. clients from the Internal Revenue Service. An attorney for Weil said he was innocent and called the indictment against him "totally unjustified." "Mr. Weil denies any suggestion that he was aware of, engaged in or tolerated any illegal conduct in the operation of UBS's U.S. cross-border business," the attorney, Aaron Marcu, said in a statement. UBS said in a statement commenting on the indictment that Weil was chairman and chief executive officer of its global wealth management and business banking division. The statement said Weil was a member of the bank's group executive board, and that he had relinquished his duties with the bank effective immediately "in the interest of the firm and its clients and in order to defend himself." Weil was replaced on an interim basis by Marten Hoekstra, deputy CEO of global wealth management and business banking. A spokesman for Weil's U.S. lawyer said Weil is based in Switzerland. U.S. authorities did not publicly link the Weil case with that of Bradley Birkenfeld, a former UBS banker who pleaded guilty in June to helping a billionaire hide $200 million in assets from U.S. tax authorities. Birkenfeld has agreed to cooperate with investigators. UBS said it was continuing its efforts to cooperate with an ongoing investigation into its cross-border U.S. business. Weil and other unnamed bankers identified as co-defendants in his case are accused of being part of an effort to help U.S. clients hide $20 billion of assets between 2002 and 2007, a business that Weil himself called "toxic waste," the U.S. Department of Justice said in a statement. UBS gained $200 million a year in revenue from the work of Weil and the other executives and managers, the department said. The grand jury indictment, unsealed by the federal prosecutor for the Southern District of Florida, said other UBS executives in "highest level" positions, and some U.S. clients of the bank, were unindicted co-conspirators in the case. The indictment accused the bank of training desk heads and bankers on how to avoid detection by U.S. authorities, for example by changing hotels and using encrypted laptop computers. It says the bank reminded clients that it had a record since 1939 of concealing client identities from the United States. "The indictment is part of a larger U.S. enforcement effort that includes an outstanding subpoena to UBS seeking the names of over 17,000 U.S. clients with Swiss accounts that have not been disclosed to the IRS," said Sen. Carl Levin, chairman of the U.S. Senate's permanent subcommittee on investigations. "UBS told our subcommittee back in July that it was ready to cooperate, but the Swiss government has since forbidden UBS to turn over the names, claiming disclosure would violate Swiss secrecy laws," Levin said. UBS decided earlier this year to stop offering offshore Swiss bank accounts to U.S. citizens. The bank was recently described by U.S. President-elect Barack Obama as one of the banks that helped "tax cheats." According to the indictment, UBS bankers recruited clients at a major annual arts fair in Miami Beach, the Art Basel Miami Beach. Similar allegations were made when Birkenfeld was charged. Birkenfeld's attorney, David Meier, said he was unable to comment on any links between his case and Weil's. "When all is said and done, the full nature and scope of Brad Birkenfeld's contribution to the investigation will be very clear for all to see," Meier told Reuters. Birkenfeld initially pleaded not guilty. His change of heart and a subsequent plea deal were widely seen as bolstering a U.S. investigation of UBS' conduct in relation to services it provided to U.S. clients from 2000 through 2007. UBS has long been known as a zealous guardian of Swiss banking secrecy and the privacy of its customers. Weil faces a maximum of five years in prison and a fine of $250,000 if convicted on all counts. (Additional reporting by  Diane Bartz  and  Randall Mikkelsen ; Editing by  Michael Christie )
