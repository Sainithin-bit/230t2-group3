 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil futures fell more than $1 after Wednesday's settlement on mounting pessimism about the global economic outlook. 

 November delivery crude was down as much at $1.09, hitting $55.07 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange's Globex trading platform, after settling earlier Monday at $56.16 a barrel, down $3.17 from Tuesday's finish. Traders have said crude futures may find support in a range between $50 and $55 a barrel. (Reporting by  Erwin Seba ; Editing by  David Gregorio ; Editing by David Gregorio)
