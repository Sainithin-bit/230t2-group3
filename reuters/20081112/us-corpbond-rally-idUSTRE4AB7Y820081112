 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. corporate bonds are registering their first sustained gains since Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy, but the market's rally is offering little relief to many cash-strapped companies. 

 Rebounding from their worst selloff ever, investment grade corporate bonds have posted a 2.7 percent total return month to date, according to data from Merrill Lynch. The rally is improving appetite for new issues, but terms are still onerous and only well-known investment-grade companies are finding takers for large debt sales. "I think the risk is we're going to have some complacency start to bake in because the assumption is the worst is over," said John Atkins, analyst at IDEAGlobal in New York. "But I think on a very material basis, the worst is still ahead of us in terms of companies still defaulting and debt service becoming too expensive to remain an economic option." Signs of healing in the short-term debt markets, massive central bank rate cuts, and expanded government bailouts have all raised hopes that the worst of a crippling credit freeze may be in the past. In one indication of improving sentiment, spreads on investment-grade corporate bonds have narrowed by 32 basis points from a record high of 618 basis points on October 29, according to Merrill Lynch data. Spreads generally narrow as investors' appetite for corporate risk improves. NO RETURN TO EASY MONEY Borrowers are taking advantage of the market's better tone while it lasts. Through Monday, U.S. companies had sold $10.6 billion of corporate bonds this month, and over $3 billion more were being marketed on Wednesday. That compares with sales for all of October of about $21 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. The high-yield market remains frozen, however. Besieged by hedge fund selling, that market has absorbed only one new issue since September, a $750 million offering from casino operator MGM Mirage ( MGM.N ). Even high-grade companies are paying junk-like yields to sell debt. Tobacco company Altria Group ( MO.N ), for example, paid coupons of 9.95 percent to sell 30-year debt last week, or a yield of 600 basis points more than Treasuries. Historically, junk bond yields averaged about 450 basis points over Treasuries. "We're not going back to where we were in terms of many of the spreads levels, the liquidity that's accessible," Putnam Investments portfolio manager Bill Kohli said on a conference call on Tuesday. "Especially in the finance industry, people are going to have to operate without the same kind of easy access to capital they've had before." Single-A rated AT&T Inc( T.N ) on Wednesday launched a $1.5 billion five-year debt sale with expected yields of about 437.5 basis points over Treasuries, according to IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication. The company sold similar maturity debt in May at just 168 basis points more than Treasuries. The lowest quality junk bonds would have to pay rates of over 30 percent to sell debt, based on average yields on outstanding bonds. HIGHER DEFAULT RATE LOOMS "I don't see any quick return to high-yield issuance in any size, and I think the funding options for even single-A and triple-B borrowers are pretty expensive and difficult," said IDEAGlobal's Atkins. Single-A and triple-B are the two lower categories of investment-grade ratings. Moody's Investors Service on Wednesday raised its forecast for the global junk bond default rate to 4.3 percent by the end of the year and 10.4 percent a year from now. As recently as last month, it predicted the default rate would reach 4.2 percent by year end and 7.9 percent by October 2009. The attractive yields on corporate debt, rather than optimism about the fundamental outlook, is likely the reason for growing investor interest, strategists said. "Valuation alone, rather than misplaced economic optimism, seems to have been enough to stabilize or improve longer-term credit markets," Citigroup Global Markets economist Stephen Wieting said in a recent report.
