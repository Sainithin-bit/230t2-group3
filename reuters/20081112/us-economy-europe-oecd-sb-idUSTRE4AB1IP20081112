 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - There is room for further interest rate cuts in Europe because inflation is falling quickly, the head of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Angel Gurria said on Wednesday. 

 "Headline inflation is now rapidly receding, thanks to falling commodity prices," he said in a speech prepared for a Brussels policy briefing. "With inflation expectations well-anchored and substantial economic slack likely to develop, there remains scope fir further reductions in policy rates," he said. Gurria also said that the possibility of establishing a single European financial supervisor should not be ruled out and that discretionary fiscal easing was an important near-term policy option in Europe.
