 BOSTON  (Reuters) - General Electric Co ( GE.N ) has secured the temporary backing of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp for up to $139 billion of the debt of its finance arm, a spokesman said on Wednesday. 

 "We are eligible now and included in the FDIC temporary liquidity guarantee program," said Russell Wilkerson, a spokesman for the U.S. conglomerate. "This allows us to source our debt competitively with other financial institutions that are eligible. It certainly helps put us on a level playing field with other issuers," he said, adding, "It's beneficial to us in the market and it's part of a very clear plan and a number of decisive steps here to strengthen our liquidity plan through this volatile time." GE shares were down $1.71, or 9.6 percent, at $16.10 on the New York Stock Exchange. Earlier they fell to $16.05, their lowest point in more than 11 years.
