 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Home values in the United States posted their seventh consecutive quarterly decline, with nearly one-third of Americans who sold in the past year losing money, real estate website Zillow.com said on Wednesday. 

 Home values fell 9.7 percent year-over-year in the third quarter to a Zillow Home Value Index of $202,966, according to the third quarter Zillow Real Estate Market Reports, which encompass 163 metropolitan areas. Home values have dropped a total 12.8 percent since the market peaked in 2006. Year-over-year declines in the second quarter were 8.8 percent, indicating that price drops continued to accelerate in the third quarter, the reports showed. The continued declines in value are causing more homeowners to sell their homes for less than the original purchase price. Over the past 12 months, 30.2 percent of homes sold were sold for a loss, up from 23.7 percent at the end of the second quarter. In 17 markets -- 14 of them in California -- more than half of homes sold in the past year were sold for a loss, the reports showed. The percentage of homeowners with negative equity remained fairly steady from the second to the third quarter, however, as more foreclosures were completed and as median down payments rose in 61 markets. One in seven, or 14.3 percent, of all homeowners across the country has negative equity, and of homeowners who bought in the last five years, almost one-third, or 29.5 percent, are 'under water', the reports showed. "The fact that one-quarter of markets in Zillow's third quarter reports show negative or relatively flat annualized change over five years is an indication of the enormous amount of value that has been taken out of the real estate market through home value depreciation in the past few years," Stan Humphries, Zillow vice president of data and analytics, said in a statement. "It's clear we are at a unique point in history; we've had seven consecutive quarters of decline, and we expect that to continue until at least the middle of next year. Most markets are still seeing five-year annualized returns, but we will see more markets slip into flat or negative long-term change as the economy continues to suffer, factors like job losses begin to further affect foreclosure rates and home values continue to decline," he said. Foreclosures made up almost one in five, or 18.6 percent, of all transactions in the past 12 months and areas with the highest foreclosure rates are the markets with some of the greatest home value declines. In California's Central Valley, 57.6 percent of transactions in Merced were foreclosures, and in Stockton, foreclosures made up 56.4 percent of transactions. The New York metro area continued to have the lowest rate of foreclosures, with only 3.5 percent of all transactions being foreclosures, the reports showed.
