 SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - U.S. bank Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) has laid off eight analysts from its Asia Pacific ex-Japan equities research team, according to a company note obtained by Reuters on Wednesday. 

 A source familiar with the matter said the cuts were in line with the firm's decision to reduce its headcount by about 10 percent globally. Goldman will drop coverage of 38 firms as a result of the move, including Hynix Semiconductor ( 000660.KS ), LG Electronics ( 066570.KS ), Hyundai Engineering & Construction ( 000720.KS ) and Clear Media ( 0100.HK ), the note from the company said. A Goldman spokeswoman in Hong Kong declined to comment. Goldman has cut about 10 percent of its investment bankers in Tokyo, including one of Japan's top women bankers, as part of global efforts to cut its workforce, people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Tuesday.
