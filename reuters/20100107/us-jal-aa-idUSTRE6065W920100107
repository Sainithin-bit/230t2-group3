 TOKYO  (Reuters) - American Airlines has raised its offer of investment in Japan Airlines Corp by $300 million to $1.4 billion, the Wall Street Journal reported on its Web site. 

 American said last month that it, other members of the Oneworld airline alliance and private equity fund TPG are willing to invest $1.1 billion in JAL to prevent it defecting to Delta Air Lines and the rival Skyteam group. American met with JAL executives Thursday morning and sweetened its offer, the Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter. A formal announcement on the sweetened offer is expected next week, the newspaper said. (Reporting by  Nathan Layne ; Editing by  Edwina Gibbs )
