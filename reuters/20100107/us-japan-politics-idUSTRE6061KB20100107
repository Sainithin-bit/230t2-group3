 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japanese leader Yukio Hatoyama has survived a fuss over his finance chief's resignation and has a shot at steering his party to victory in a midyear election, but doubts persist about his ability to make tough policy decisions. 

 A scandal dogging the ruling party's No.2, Ichiro Ozawa, seen by critics as carrying too much clout over policies, remains a wild card as does the economy, still fragile after emerging from Japan's worst recession since World War Two. A pledge by Hatoyama to decide by May how to resolve a feud with Washington over a U.S. airbase on Okinawa island also represents a difficult challenge of his leadership skills. Hatoyama's Democratic Party (DPJ), which trounced the long-dominant Liberal Democrats in an August poll, needs to win a majority in the mid-year upper house poll to end reliance on two tiny coalition parties whose demands can make decisions problematic on matters from U.S.-Japan security ties to public spending. A defeat for the ruling bloc in the poll for the upper house, which can delay legislation, could create a political deadlock, foiling policy implementation as Japan grapples with the deep structural problems of an aging, shrinking population. The rich grandson of an earlier premier, the softspoken Hatoyama has seen his ratings sag to under 50 percent in some surveys due to voters' perception he's indecisive and under Ozawa's thumb. But support for the Democrats, who have vowed to pay more heed to consumers than companies, and to put politicians rather than bureaucrats in control of policies, is still around 40 percent, about double that of the demoralized Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). "Anything can happen between now and July, but if the election were called now, there is a good chance the Democrats could secure a majority," said Koichi Nakano, a political science professor at Tokyo's Sophia University. Hatoyama on Wednesday picked his deputy Naoto Kan as finance minister, turning to a politician with considerable clout but less hawkish fiscal views than his elderly predecessor, who quit for health reasons. Media reports said 77-year-old Hirohisa Fujii was also fed up after friction with party mastermind Ozawa. DEMOCRATS' SUPPORT HOLDS FOR NOW Kan, in his first lengthy remarks since taking his new post, said he wanted the yen to weaken to avoid hurting an export-led recovery and would work with the central bank to achieve that. He also suggested the debt-burdened government would spend to stimulate if growth faltered, a stance that might play well ahead of the election but could be a worry for bond markets. Analysts said the selection of Kan, a fiery debater and harsh critic of bureaucrats, made good political sense. "For a while, I was concerned that Hatoyama would turn out hopelessly indecisive but I think the decision was made quickly enough," Nakano said. "I'm reasonably optimistic about Kan. I don't know if he has the expertise needed to be a good finance minister but as a politician he is quite savvy and experienced," Nakano added. Japanese media speculated Hatoyama had picked Kan because Ozawa, whose strategic skills helped the Democrats win big in August and are vital to victory in the upper house poll, would have objected to other lawmakers whose names were floated. But while a perception Hatoyama is Ozawa's puppet could further dent the prime minister's ratings, some analysts said many voters were not so uncomfortable with the duo at the helm. "The Hatoyama-Ozawa pair may work surprisingly well until the upper house election," said Tsuneo Watanabe, a senior fellow at the Tokyo Foundation, a think tank. "Hatoyama is not that popular, but support for the DPJ is still firm. Voters feel they want to give them more of a chance." Hatoyama will likely survive a funding scandal involving heaps of cash received from his rich heiress mother. But a separate scandal hanging over Ozawa, forced to quit as Democratic Party leader in May after an ex-aide was charged with accepting illegal donations, might prove problematic. Japanese media said Ozawa would be questioned by prosecutors soon over a land purchase funded from a mysterious stash of 400 million yen ($4.3 million). "Prosecutors are really going after Ozawa," said Hirotaka Futatsuki, an independent political commentator. Analysts said the chances of Ozawa being brought down by the affair appeared remote, but agreed that if he were sidelined, it would be a big blow for the Democrats ahead of the election. "There is no doubt that would be the biggest present ever to the LDP from the prosecutors," Nakano said. ($1=92.30 yen) (Editing by  Jerry Norton )
