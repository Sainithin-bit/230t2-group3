 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A New York judge has ordered billionaire financier Ron Perelman to pay more than $4 million to a film development company he co-founded with his ex-wife, actress Ellen Barkin. 

 Manhattan-based Applehead Pictures LLC sued Perelman in 2007 in New York state Supreme Court, alleging the Revlon Inc chairman failed to make payments he had pledged to cover the company's operating expenses. Justice Debra James issued the order in December that Perelman pay $3.4 million promised to the company, plus interest. The judgment was formally entered against Perelman on Thursday. Perelman and Barkin, his fourth wife, went through a bitter divorce in 2006. Barkin, who starred in "Sea of Love" and "Ocean's Thirteen," reportedly got a $40 million settlement. Barkin, Perelman and Barkin's brother, George Barkin, created Applehead Pictures LLC in 2005. Later that year Perelman made a $465,000 payment to Applehead. Perelman counter-sued, also in 2007, saying Barkin used the company to settle a personal score and to employ her brother, a former editor of "High Times" magazine. A representative for Perelman declined to comment. (Reporting by  Edith Honan , editing by Ellen Wulfhorst and  Vicki Allen )
