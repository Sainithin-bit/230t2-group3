 Corrects spelling of Sallie Mae in headline 

 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - SLM Corp SLM.N, known as Sallie Mae, said on Monday it filed a lawsuit against the group that has agreed to buy it, seeking damages of $900 million. The suit, filed in Delaware Chancery Court, seeks a declaration that the buyer group has repudiated the merger agreement, that no material adverse effect has occurred under the merger agreement, and that Sallie Mae may terminate the merger agreement and collect damages. The consortium of private equity firms J.C. Flowers & Co and Friedman Fleischer and Lowe and major banks JP Morgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ) and Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) agreed in April to pay $25 billion, or $60 per share, for Sallie Mae. Last week it sent a revised proposal to the student lender offering to pay $50 a share in cash plus warrants that could result in an extra payout. Sallie Mae responded by saying it expects the buyers to honor their original contract.
