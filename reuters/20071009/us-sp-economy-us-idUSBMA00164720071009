 MUMBAI  (Reuters) - The chief economist of international ratings agency Standard and Poor's expects unemployment in the U.S. to rise further and said the world's largest economy was only halfway through the present housing crisis. 

 "I still think we are not through with the housing crisis yet -- housing starts are going to drop further, the unemployment rate is going to tick up further, we are expecting another year of sluggish U.S. economic growth. We are not halfway through with this crisis yet," David Wyss, S&P's chief economist, told reporters in Mumbai on Tuesday.
