 ST LOUIS  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis President William Poole said on Tuesday that if the U.S. central bank had to raise interest rates to keep inflation under control, it would not shrink from that task. 

 "If that is what we have to do to achieve the objective of low and stable inflation ... then that is what we'll have to do," Poole told the Industrial Asset Management Council in response to a question following a luncheon speech. Poole is a voting member of the Fed's interest-rate setting committee this year.
