 LONDON  (Reuters) - Britain threw a fresh lifeline to Northern Rock on Tuesday, offering to guarantee new retail deposits and extend funding arrangements to give the bank time to salvage something from its battered business. 

 The latest aid package came as the country's financial services watchdog said Northern Rock may not have needed to draw on emergency funds from the Bank of England (BoE) at all if its rescue had not been conducted in the full public glare. Northern Rock, which saw a run on deposits last month after it was forced by the global credit crunch to seek an emergency funding line from the BoE, said the new package would cost it 40 million ($82 million) to 50 million pounds this year -- around 10 percent of its targeted 2007 profit. But the bank said the new help would buy it time to assess its full range of options, which include being taken over as a whole, being broken up or even attempting to remain independent on a smaller scale -- an option largely discounted previously. The review process should be completed by February, it said. Analysts said the new arrangements could help to reassure prospective buyers and allay fears of shareholders and bondholders of a firesale of assets. But the arrangements are also controversial, as the decision to guarantee new retail deposits could potentially give Northern Rock an advantage over competitors. "If my mother were to ask me where she should put her money at the moment, I would say Northern Rock," Numis Securities analyst James Hamilton said. "What (prospective) buyers will want to know, is how long these arrangements will last and whether they will continue (after a deal)." Northern Rock said the arrangements would remain in place "during the current instability in the financial markets" and that it would "pay an appropriate fee ... to ensure that it does not receive a commercial advantage". Paying a commercial rate should help ease concerns the move could be found to count as undue state aid. The EU Commission said Tuesday it would form an opinion once it had full details. BACK FROM THE BRINK? The government had previously agreed to guarantee retail deposits made with Northern Rock before September 19 -- the day after its initial pledge -- but said moving beyond that would be unfair. It said on Tuesday, however, that it would extend the guarantee to all new deposits "during the current instability in financial markets". It also said it would offer additional funding from the BoE on more flexible terms, which will allow Northern Rock to also use commercial lending as and when it can. News of the agreement lifted Northern Rock's shares, down almost 70 percent since the crisis began in mid-September. The stock ended the day up 19.9 percent at 206.75 pence. "The situation must have been pretty near death, but Northern Rock now gets almost five months to find a buyer," Royal Bank of Scotland credit analysts said. "The timeline could encourage bigger banks to take a look if wholesale markets start to recover... If no buyer emerges, it will be curtains for Northern Rock at the end of February." Northern Rock, advised by Citi and Merrill Lynch, said talks with suitors were continuing, but sources familiar with the matter said a deal was "months rather than weeks" away. U.S. buyout firms Cerberus and JC Flowers are considering moves on the bank, according to other sources familiar with the matter. British and U.S. newspapers have also named Blackstone, Lone Star and Apollo as possible suitors. The crisis at Northern Rock has prompted widespread criticism of Britain's regulators for failing to prevent the first run on a UK bank in over a century. The Financial Services Authority, responsible for regulating UK banks, took its turn in the stand on Tuesday, telling parliamentarians during a grueling two-hour hearing that there were lessons to be learnt from the crisis. The FSA said a covert operation to save Northern Rock would have been an attractive option -- though it was impossible under UK rules and impracticable in modern markets, it said. An effort to save the bank by stealth, however, might have avoided the need for Northern Rock to draw on the BoE facility. "It did not actually fail to fund itself -- maturities shortened back into the overnight period, to the point the board thought it prudent to seek the lender of last resort facility," Chief Executive Hector Sants said in the hearing. "They needed the insurance of opening up a facility with the Bank of England. They would not have had to use that facility had there not been the retail run." Northern Rock's management is due to come before the same committee next week. (Additional reporting by  Mark Potter ,  Sumeet Desai  and Richard Barley in London and  Dale Hudson  in Brussels)
