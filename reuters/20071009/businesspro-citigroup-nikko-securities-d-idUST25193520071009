 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Citigroup ( C.N ) said on Tuesday it would 
merge its retail securities business in Japan with unit Nikko 
Cordial Corp 8603.T, as part of the U.S. financial firm's 
push in the world's second-largest economy. 

  Citigroup said last week it would buy out minority 
shareholders in Nikko Cordial, Japan's third-largest brokerage, 
for $4.6 billion. Under the buyout, Nikko Cordial will be 
delisted from the Tokyo exchange and Citigroup will list its 
own shares.  The two companies said in a statement they plan to bring 
their separate brokerage businesses together as early as May 
2008.  While Citigroup's brokerage unit has just two outlets in 
Japan, Nikko boasts a network of 110 branches and strong 
recognition among domestic investors.  Under the integration the Citigroup unit, Citibank 
Securities, would likely be merged into Nikko Cordial, the 
companies said.  After more than 100 years as niche player in Japan, 
Citigroup has been steadily rebranding itself for the Japanese 
market.  Earlier this year the firm relaunched its Japanese unit as 
a local bank, becoming the first foreign bank to receive 
approval to operate as a local entity and making it easier to 
open new branches.  Citigroup is one of several financial firms, including 
London-based HSBC Holdings PLC ( HSBA.L ), looking to target 
Japan's millions of wealthy individuals and the country's 
estimated $13 trillion in household assets.  Earlier this year Citigroup spent about $8 billion to buy a 
68 percent stake in Nikko Cordial, its biggest-ever Asian 
acquisition.
