 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - International Paper Co ( IP.N ), one of the world's largest paper makers, said on Tuesday its third-quarter results will fall short of analyst estimates due to lower-than-expected land sales. 

 The company now expects land sales of about $100 million in the quarter from its earlier forecast of $110 million to $140 million. (Reporting by  Euan Rocha , editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)
