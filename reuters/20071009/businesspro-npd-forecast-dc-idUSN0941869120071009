 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Retailers are touting holiday deals 
and discounts earlier than ever this year, but the efforts may 
fall flat as consumers expect to start shopping for this 
crucial season later than ever, according to a survey released 
on Tuesday by NPD Group. 

  Forty-one percent of survey respondents said they do not 
expect to begin their holiday shopping until after Thanksgiving 
-- 10 percent more than a year ago.  "Retailers are looking to start the season earlier but 
consumers just aren't ready." said NPD Chief Industry Expert 
Marshal Cohen in a statement.  Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, typically marks 
the launch of the ultra-competitive holiday shopping season.  But many retailers have already introduced early holiday 
deals and started clogging mailboxes with gift guides, worried 
about the state of consumer spending headed into the end of the 
year.  Wal-Mart Stores Inc began cutting prices on hot toys on 
Sept 30, while on September 28, L.L. Bean began offering free 
shipping and handling to all customers through December 21.  Home furnishing retailer Pottery Barn, a unit of 
Williams-Sonoma Inc, sent an e-mail on September 28 inviting 
recipients to "be the first to shop our new holiday 
collections."  But the early efforts may not be enough to get shoppers 
into holiday shopping mode.  "The hesitation comes in because there isn't that one 
must-have item coupled with the fact that consumers are 
conditioned to expect deeper discounts as it gets later in the 
season... where's the incentive to shop early?" Cohen said.  The survey was conducted between September 10 and September 
17, and was based on information from 1,943 completed 
interviews.
