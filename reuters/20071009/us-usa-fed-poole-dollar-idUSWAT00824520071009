 St. Louis  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President William Poole said on Tuesday that the depreciation of the U.S. dollar is something that is not explicable. 

 "The depreciation of the dollar is something that we cannot explain," Poole told the Industrial Asset Management Council. "We cannot explain the fluctuation of currencies after they have occurred."
