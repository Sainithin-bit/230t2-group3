 ST LOUIS  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis President William Poole said on Tuesday that the deprecation of the dollar should not hit inflation, owing to the limited passthrough from the currency via import prices. 

 "I do not see any implication for inflation, at least with the magnitude of the depreciation that we've seen so far," Poole told reporters after a speech to the Industrial Asset Management Council. "I did not see any evidence of a raft of dollar price increases for foreign goods, with the exception obviously of commodities," he said, noting commodity prices were set in world markets. "But for manufactured goods, I think the passthrough is very, very small," he said. Poole, who is a voter on the Fed's interest-rate setting committee this year, also said that inflation expectations remained well anchored since the central bank cut interest rates by half a percentage point on September 18.
