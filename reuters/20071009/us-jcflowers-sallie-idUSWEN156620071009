 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - J.C. Flowers & Co said on Tuesday that the $25 billion takeover price its investor group offered student lender Sallie Mae has expired and that the future of deal would be resolved in court. 

 SLM Corp SLM.N filed a lawsuit on Monday seeking the $900 million break-up fee tied to the deal. "We regret that our offer to amend the terms of the Sallie Mae transaction was allowed to expire without discussion," J.C. Flowers said in a statement. "Instead, Sallie Mae filed what we firmly believe is a meritless lawsuit. We now look forward to having this matter resolved in the Delaware Chancery Court." J.C. Flowers, together with Friedman Fleischer and Lowe and banks JP Morgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ) and Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) offered $60 per share for Sallie Mae earlier this year, but have since revised that offer down to $50 per share.
