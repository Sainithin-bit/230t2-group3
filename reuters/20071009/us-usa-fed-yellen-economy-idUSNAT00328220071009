 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President Janet Yellen said on Tuesday that the United States still faces downside economic risks. 

 The Fed's aggressive interest rate cut in September was helpful in reducing those risks, but it is too early to say the United States has "dodged a bullet," Yellen told reporters after a speech on the economy to a Town Hall-Los Angeles public affairs forum. Asked about the impact of the weak U.S. dollar on the inflation outlook, Yellen said that so far the currency's decline has had "surprisingly little impact" on U.S. import prices. Yellen is not a voting member of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee in 2007.
