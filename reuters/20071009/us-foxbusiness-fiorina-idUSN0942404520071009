 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - News Corp's NWSa.N upcoming Fox Business Network said on Tuesday it has tapped former Hewlett-Packard Co ( HPQ.N ) Chief Executive Carly Fiorina to be an on-air contributor ahead of the cable network's highly anticipated launch. 

 Fiorina, who served as HP chairman and CEO from 1999 to 2005 and who led the buyout of Compaq Computer, will be a general business contributor to the network. Some two years in the making, Fox Business is scheduled to debut on October 15 in more than 30 million U.S. homes and aims to compete against cable business news leader General Electric's ( GE.N ) CNBC.
