 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President Janet Yellen on Tuesday said she was on the fence about the interest rate outlook given the high level of uncertainty about the U.S. economy. 

 "I have a totally open mind about what, if anything, is going to be needed from here on in," Yellen told reporters after a speech to a Town Hall-Los Angeles public affairs forum. Yellen said the Fed's aggressive one-half percentage point interest rate cut in September, which took the fed funds target to 4.75 percent, had helped limit downside risks but it is too early to say that the rate cut means the economy has "dodged a bullet," she said. "Any forecast and any analysis of events should be made with a great deal of humility," Yellen said, adding that fallout on the economy and on markets from the credit crunch that descended in August is most likely not over. The U.S. economy turned in a reasonably good performance in the third quarter, helped by robust personal spending, but effects of recent financial turmoil are more likely to show up in fourth-quarter data, she said. Housing remains a sore spot, with many indicators pointing downward even before the financial turmoil began, Yellen said. Given the bulging inventories of unsold new homes, "further price declines may be needed to bring housing markets into balance," which coupled with higher mortgage interest rates could still crimp consumption. Yellen, the Fed's 12th District president, said the central bank was not engaging in "moral hazard" with its rate cut by possibly shielding speculators from losses. "Investors who misjudged risks will surely suffer losses even if monetary policy is successful in keeping the economy on track. ... I don't believe that the Fed should stand aside as a financial shock threatens to derail the economy." Yellen is not a voting member of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee in 2007. INFLATION ABATING Yellen said inflation pressures had improved to the point where a rate cut might have been possible even without the recent financial turmoil, because lower inflation had pushed up the "real" fed funds rate. Interest rates were "moderately restrictive" ahead of the Fed's September 18 rate cut, its first in four years, she said. After a significant decline in the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index this year, "inflation is closer to where we would like it to be" and could edge down more over the next few years, she said. Yellen forecast some slack emerging in the labor market, where the U.S. jobless rate has started to climb back from unusually low levels. Even at this year's cycle lows in the jobless rate, which often fuel worries about wage inflation, wages and compensation gains have been "well behaved," she said. "However, we do still face some inflation risks, mainly due to faster increases in unit labor costs and the depreciation of the dollar, and these will need to be watched carefully," she added. Yellen told reporters that the weak dollar has had a surprisingly small impact on U.S. import prices and would probably continue to do so as long as inflation expectations remain well anchored. Financial markets recently have pared back expectations for the Fed to make additional rate cuts in the near term. Implied prospects for another one-quarter point cut at the FOMC's October 30-31 meeting are currently near 34 percent against about 64 percent before Friday's stronger-than-expected September payrolls report. Yellen said that many of the liquidity problems that swamped financial markets are gradually being resolved. "My sense at this point is that things are improving," she said, while noting that not all markets would return to "business as usual." Some of the structured credit products that became popular in recent years may prove to be too complex to be viable going forward, she said. Banks are still cautious about lending and uncertain about how their liquidity needs will evolve, Yellen said. "They seem to remain concerned about making commitments of funds for longer periods of time."
