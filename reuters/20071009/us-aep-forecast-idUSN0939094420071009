 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Utility operator American Electric Power ( AEP.N ) stuck to its 2007 earnings forecast on Tuesday after agreeing to a landmark multibillion-dollar pollution settlement. 

 The company, the largest consumer of coal in the Western Hemisphere, said late on Monday it had settled an eight-year legal battle over pollution from its power plants that calls for it to pay $15 million in civil penalties and $60 million in clean-up costs. Environmental group Natural Resources Defense Council said the Columbus, Ohio-based company would spend a total of $4.6 billion on the fines and to upgrade its pollution controls at its plants, although AEP has disputed that figure. The new pollution controls will reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide by 79 percent and nitrogen oxide emissions by 69 percent from the 16 plants covered by the settlement. Those pollutants are the key causes of smog and acid rain, which damages soil and forests. AEP's biggest expense as a result of the suit will not start until 2017, the company said, when it will spend $1.6 billion to upgrade a major coal-fired power plant in southern Indiana. Financial forecasts and capital spending plans would not be affected by the deal, and AEP reaffirmed its forecast in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission for 2007 ongoing earnings of $2.90 to $3.00 per share. The lawsuit, brought in 1999 by eight states, the Environmental Protection Agency and more than a dozen green groups, accused AEP of expanding or modifying its older plants without installing pollution-control equipment in violation of "new source review" rules requiring environmental upgrades. The suit involved nine of the power generator's oldest coal-fired plants. Those plants are in Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky, Virginia and West Virginia. AEP, with 38,000 megawatts of power generating capacity, is one of the largest power producers in the United States. About two-thirds of AEP's power is made by burning coal.
