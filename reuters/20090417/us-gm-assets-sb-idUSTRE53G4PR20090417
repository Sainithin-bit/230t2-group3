 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp has dropped a plan to sell its AC Delco parts business and expects final bids on its Hummer SUV brand by next week, the company said on Friday. 

 GM Chief Executive Fritz Henderson said the automaker had been in talks with a number of interested parties on AC Delco but decided to stop the sale process because the tough credit market was dragging down the price of the profitable asset. "We just concluded recently that we're not able to achieve the kind of price we would need for this business to justify a sale," Henderson said on a conference call. "So we're going to keep the business. We're going to run it and grow it." AC Delco provides light-duty maintenance and repair parts and associated services for both GM and non-GM vehicles in more than 100 countries. The automaker had retained Merrill Lynch to assist in the sale of the unit. GM, which is operating under U.S. government emergency aid, has scrambled to unload its money-losing brands and operations as it races to raise cash and restructure its balance sheet. But the global recession, tight credit and sinking auto sales have made any auto asset an extremely tough sell, and several potential bidders have publicly denied any interest. GM is in the process of exploring options or offloading several business units, including its Saturn, Saab and Opel nameplates. The automaker has been trying to sell its Hummer brand since June. In December, GM said it was looking to drop its Pontiac, Saab and Saturn brands in addition to Hummer as part of a sweeping restructuring. GM said it would focus on Chevrolet, Buick, Cadillac and GMC, which represent 83 percent of current sales. Henderson said the automaker still planned to stick to its four core brands but was examining all elements of its brand strategy. He called reports that GM would be dropping one of the core brands "speculation." "Frankly we're looking at the purposes and reasons for all of our brands but our belief is that the four-core brand strategy is the right way to go to market," Henderson said. FINAL BIDS ON HUMMER GM faces a June 1 deadline to convince the U.S. autos task force overseeing its restructuring that it has a viable business plan. The automaker is racing to get concessionary deals from its bondholders and union and sell assets. GM has yet to announce any sale agreements but said it was close to a decision on Hummer. "We expect final bids from three potential purchasers by next week, and we're targeting, trying to make a decision as to where we want to go with one of these three before the end of the month," Henderson said. He also said the automaker would like to make a decision on Saturn soon. An investor group that includes private equity firm Black Oak Partners LLC and some Saturn dealers has approached GM about buying the assets of the Saturn brand and distribution network. "That firm (Black Oak Partners) is not the only firm who's got the interest in Saturn," Henderson said. "There are several other companies. The Saturn situation is a different thing from Hummer of AC Delco." "We'd like to bring this matter to resolution relatively promptly," he added. Henderson also said the sale process was progressing for its European brands. GM's Saab, which had sought protection from creditors in February to restructure, is seeking a buyer after the U.S. automaker said it would cut ties with the brand by January 1, 2010. "We have a number of parties who are in the stage of looking at Saab, and our books are open in terms of what the business looks like," Henderson said.
