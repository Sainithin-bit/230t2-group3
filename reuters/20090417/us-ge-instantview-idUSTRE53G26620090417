 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - General Electric Co ( GE.N ) posted a 36 percent decline in quarterly profit on weakness in its finance and media businesses, but industry analysts focused on a strong order backlog and GE's position to weather the tough economic environment. 

 The industrial conglomerate, widely seen as a barometer for the U.S. economy, said that while it continues to experience rising delinquencies at its financial services business, questions about credit ratings have been resolved. "We still have a strong rating and our outlook is stable," said GE Chairman and CEO Jeff Immelt. "Amid a continued weak economy, we're performing well and our backlog remains strong," he added. The company posted a profit of 26 cents per share, higher than the 21 cents per share expected by Wall Street analysts. GE shares turned higher in trading before the market on Friday. COMMENT JIM HARDESTY, PRESIDENT, MARKET STRATEGIST & CHIEF ECONOMIST AT HARDESTY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT IN BALTIMORE "Given the state of the economy, General Electric ( GE.N ) is demonstrating that it too is turning with the rest of everything, which is good news. I also think its financial services area was better than we expected, that's probably the best news. The result still wasn't good, though. "I think we're seeing a bottoming of the trends. I feel that the numbers are showing stabilization in the global economy and in the performance of GE stock, which I think has been victimized by both the uptick rule and naked short selling. While the company continues to do its basic blocking and tackling in a very difficult environment, now you're beginning to see that the company can perform admirably in a very difficult environment. "I do believe GE knows its been put in the penalty box and that management is determined to demonstrate that it can perform in an extremely difficult environment." DANIEL HOLLAND, EQUITY ANALYST, MORNINGSTAR, CHICAGO: "By and large, things panned out the way I had expected. The impressive parts really continue to be on the Energy Infrastructure side, where they were able to grow revenue and profits in the quarter. And that's pretty good given the state of the economy." "NBC Universal was down materially. By and large you look a the numbers and you say they did what you would expect them to do and maybe a little bit better." "I expected things to be pretty weak at NBC. Seeing the numbers come in with (divisional) profits down 45 percent is pretty tough. Consumer and industrial took a pretty good licking as well... barely even profitable." "Energy Infrastructure has been the backbone of growth for the company. Looking at the demand for gas turbines and the fact that we have a good incentive plan for renewable energy in place now, that should keep growth going pretty strong there." EDWARD MARACCINI, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, OPTIQUE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, MILWAUKEE "My gut reaction is on the capital side it's probably a little better than expected. There are no surprises on the downside and that's really good. "What's going to be really important here is if they don't have to raise new capital. That's key here. We don't want to see GE have to do an equity offering because that would dilute common shareholders. It looks like there were no surprises on the capital business that would require GE to do that." MANOJ LADWA, SENIOR TRADER, ETX CAPITAL, LONDON "General Electric managed to hold its own amidst difficult market conditions. Despite a 35 percent fall in profits, revenue was strong across its various subsidiaries and earnings per share came in ahead of market expectations. Going forward, market participants are likely to focus on them adhering to their forecasts."
