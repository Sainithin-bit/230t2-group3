 ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE  (Reuters) - The White House said on Friday President Barack Obama had full confidence in Steven Rattner, the head of his auto task force who has been linked to a probe into an alleged pension kickback scheme. 

 "He's not accused of doing any wrongdoing and he's not likely to face any criminal or civil charges as it relates to this. And the pending investigation was something that he brought up to us," White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters aboard Air Force One on the way to Trinidad. Asked whether Obama had confidence in Rattner, Gibbs said: "Yes," adding that he did not expect the revelations to cast a shadow over the administration's attempts to restructure the ailing U.S. auto industry.
