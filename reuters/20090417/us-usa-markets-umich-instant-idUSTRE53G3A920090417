 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence rebounded in April to the highest levels since September before investors panicked about the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the global banking system's near implosion, a survey showed on Friday. 

 KEY POINTS: * The Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers said its preliminary April reading of consumer sentiment rose to a level of 61.9, up from 57.3 in March and was the highest since 70.3 recorded in September. * The index of current economic conditions rose to 66.6 in April from 63.3 in March and was the highest reading since December. * The index of consumer expectations rose to 58.9 in April from 53.5 in March and was the highest since September. COMMENTS: TODD CLARK, MANAGING DIRECTOR OF STOCK TRADING, NOLLENBERGER CAPITAL PARTNERS, SAN FRANCISCO: "Definitely better than expected. We had an initial positive reaction to it but the market has kind of settled back in. Basically the theme of these week has been better than expected macroeconomic data, whether it's on the housing starts, whether it's the house price index, whether it's been sentiment or both Fed Chairman and the President's comments that they are seeing some signs the economy may be stabilizing - that's definitely helped the market this. "Also the banks that have been reported have been better than expected results which is certainly encouraging and the market has basically been able to hold together. One of the factors that is going to dominate today's trading is April expirations of options which could skew things a little but." JESSICA HOVERSEN, FIXED INCOME MARKET ANALYST, MF GLOBAL RESEARCH, CHICAGO: "This number is a non-event in the greater scheme of things. There are other things the (Treasuries) market is worried about like supply and Fed's buying." JACK ABLIN, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, HARRIS PRIVATE BANK, CHICAGO: "In my view, consumer expectations have turned out to be a pretty good predictor of the direction of retail sales. I'm encouraged by this news. I would expect retail to consolidate and improve as these numbers trend higher. "Unfortunately, this won't impact retail sales for six months from now, from what I've seen. It's encouraging news, but right now we want to hear from companies. We want to make sure their earnings are coming in as expected and that their outlooks are positive. That's what investors are going to be focused on right now." MARK VITNER, ECONOMIST, WACHOVIA SECURITIES, CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA: "The rise is not that surprising. This series tends to correlate with the stock market fairly well, and certainly it did that." CARL LANTZ, U.S. INTEREST RATE STRATEGIST, CREDIT SUISSE, NEW YORK: "The upshot is that everyone is now looking for upside surprises in the data, which tells you that all this is pretty much priced in." JOSEPH TREVISANI, CHIEF MARKET ANALYST, FX SOLUTIONS, SADDLE RIVER, NEW JERSEY: "The dollar is again responding to normal economic statistics in that when you get good data you get a stronger dollar. The anticipation for this number was good, and you had a stronger dollar before the release and the dollar retained the gains after the release." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: Dow adds to gains; Nasdaq pares losses BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices hold losses DOLLAR: U.S. dollar holds gains versus euro
