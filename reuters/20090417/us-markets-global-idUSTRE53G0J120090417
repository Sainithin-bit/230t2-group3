 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oil prices rose and global stocks edged higher on Friday after a consumer survey bolstered hopes that the U.S. economy is stabilizing, but clouded outlooks from Citigroup and General Electric capped gains. 

 The U.S. dollar extended losses versus the yen as the Dow and S&P 500 traded in and out of positive territory, boosting the safe-haven appeal of the Japanese currency. Both the dollar and the yen gained against the euro. U.S. Treasury debt prices fell but the selling was relatively modest in thin volume as investors were caught between fear of new supply on the one hand and support from Federal Reserve buying on the other. But euro zone government debt fell sharply as investors took a more positive view of Citigroup and GE, driving up European stock indexes on optimism the deep U.S. recession may be waning. The jump in European equities dented gold's appeal as a safe-haven, sending prices lower amid a decline in holdings of the world's main gold exchange-traded fund, the SPDR Gold Trust. U.S. consumers expressed more confidence in the U.S. economy than they have had since the sudden collapse of Lehman Brothers in September, the Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers showed, giving equities a lift. But comments from the two U.S. corporate icons weighed on market sentiment despite their better-than-expected results. Citigroup indicated consumer credit deterioration remained a worry and GE suggested that fallout from commercial real estate losses may worsen. "Investors after taking a close look at Citi are reevaluating the news. It's really mostly accounting benefit from moving to a mark-to-model approach," said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank in Chicago. Shares of Citigroup ( C.N ) dropped 2.99 percent to $3.89, and GE ( GE.N ) rose 3.26 percent to $12.67. At 1:25 p.m., the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  gained 35.29 points, or 0.43 percent, to 8,160.72. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  rose 6.16 points, or 0.71 percent, to 871.46. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  dropped 0.68 point, or 0.04 percent, to 1,669.76. The FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of top European shares rose 1.6 percent to 814.69 points, its highest close in more than two months. Over the week, the index gained 4.7 percent. Banks in Europe rallied on hopes that the worst was over for the battered sector. BNP Paribas ( BNPP.PA ) rose 4.6 percent, Barclays ( BARC.L ) jumped 7.1 percent, Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ) added 6.2 percent, Lloyds ( LLOY.L ) and Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ) both soared about 14 percent and UBS ( UBSN.VX ) climbed 7.3 percent. "What this shows, and what the market is reacting to directly is that banking is very profitable if you take out all the stupid stuff, like exotic derivatives," said David Evans, market analyst at BetOnMarkets.com. Oil rose above $50 a barrel, helped by the strong European equities markets, although brimming crude inventories capped gains. Crude oil prices have been limited by weak demand and rising stocks, which in the United States have reached their highest level in nearly 19 years. "Stronger equities are providing support to crude oil but the commodity is starting to feel fatigued, pivoting around $50 a barrel without any momentum," said Olivier Jakob of Petromatrix. U.S. light sweet crude oil rose 66 cents to $50.64 a barrel. A speech by the European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet failed to dispel uncertainty about the bank's policy steps next month, weighing on the euro. The euro fell 1.04 percent at $1.3041. The dollar rose against a basket of major currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index .DXY up 0.84 percent at 85.922. Against the yen, the dollar slipped 0.12 percent at 99.15. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell 26/32 in price to yield 2.93 percent. The 2-year U.S. Treasury note fell 5/32 in price yield 0.98 percent. Asian stocks rose after results on Thursday from JPMorgan and Google kept shares on track for a sixth week of gains. The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS edged up 0.3 percent on the day, while Japan's Nikkei share average  .N225  climbed 1.7 percent.
