 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve is unlikely to unveil new programs any time soon to battle the severe U.S. recession as it gauges the impact of plans already in place and assesses whether recent hopeful signs for the economy prove lasting. 

 At their last meeting in mid-March, policy-makers at the central bank surprised financial markets with plans to pump an additional $1.15 trillion into the economy. In addition, the Fed is already trying to reach new areas of distressed credit markets by expanding unconventional lending programs. The Fed's policy-setting panel meets again April 28-29, but officials appear unlikely to take any new steps now. Policy-makers have said they see tentative evidence the rapid pace of the economy's steep decline may be slowing. "The economy is still very weak, but there are some encouraging signs that support cautious optimism," Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Dennis Lockhart said on Thursday. In vastly ramping up its commitment to economy-supporting operations in March, the Fed has now vowed to purchase $1.45 trillion of mortgage agency debt and securities this year and $300 billion in longer-term Treasury securities within the next six months. Markets had been expecting the Fed to go more slowly in expanding its balance sheet and were stunned by the aggressive stance policy-makers displayed. The Fed's balance sheet already stands at over $2.1 trillion. It was roughly $870 billion when the crisis first struck in August 2007. FUNDS IN PIPELINE The central bank is also working on enlarging its program to improve credit market conditions by accepting new commercial mortgage-backed securities and older commercial and residential mortgage-backed securities in various lending programs. The Fed is reluctant to extend loans beyond three-year terms because it could make it hard to withdraw money from the economy when recovery takes root, but it is weighing a longer term for loans collateralized by commercial MBS. With ample funds in the pipeline, the Fed is likely to let what is for now a mildly improving economic outlook provide the cheer for markets and consumers rather than supplying shiny new initiatives to foster recovery. "If you can point to signs of stabilization you can explain why you don't have to have to take any radical new steps," said Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP in Jersey City, New Jersey . The Fed's surprising move in March was likely dictated by a depressing sense that the economy had deteriorated since the central bank's previous meeting in January. "There seemed to be a need to balance that with something positive," Crandall said. But signs of the economy's health are less dire now. STIMULUS BUCKS Further, the impact of the government's $787 billion tax cut and spending plan will begin to show in coming months, easing the fiscal strains on local governments and putting additional money in the pockets of consumers. Still, while the Fed's Beige Book -- an anecdotal look at conditions across the country that was released on Wednesday -- concluded that while there may be encouraging glimmers, activity was still quite weak. With the possibility of additional economic and financial shocks, the Fed's willingness to find yet more unorthodox ways to lift the economy cannot be ruled out. "We have to see steady improvement in the economy before we could call a turn," said Michelle Meyer, an economist at Barclays Capital. However, she said she had no doubt the Fed would act "very aggressively" if it felt the need. "They're still very much in the camp of easy monetary policy, continuing to expand their balance sheet," she said. (Editing by Leslie Adler)
