 STOCKHOLM/HELSINKI  (Reuters) - Mobile phone maker Sony Ericsson has seen some signs of stabilizing consumer demand for consumer electronics, including phones, but in many regions demand was still weak, its chief executive said on Friday. 

 "In March there were signs of stabilization ... in the U.S. and in Europe," CEO Hideki Komiyama told Reuters in an interview, echoing similar comments from top handset maker Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ) a day earlier. "Still, in some areas we still have weakness, in Eastern Europe, in Russia, the Middle East and India, but some other areas have clearly started seeing some signs of correction." Sony Ericsson ( 6758.T ) ( ERICb.ST ) reported earlier on Friday a deep loss for January-March and said its aims to bring the company back to profit as quickly as possible. "That's our plan and desire. How that will be resolved is up to the conditions in the marketplace and the economy. At this stage, it is hard to make a clear prediction," Komiyama said. "In general, the (economic) recovery will take a rather long time, and longer than expected originally," he said. Sony Ericsson, jointly owned by Sweden's Ericsson and Japan's Sony Corp, warned last month of the deep loss for January-March, raising speculation it might break up. "Despite the fluctuations in the economic downturn ... we have full support (from the parent companies)," Komiyama said.
