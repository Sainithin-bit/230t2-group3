 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The head of InBev NV said on Tuesday that the company does not plan to raise its $65 per share offer to buy rival brewer Anheuser-Busch Companies Inc. 

 "No, $65 is a great price, full price, that's it," InBev Chief Executive Carlos Brito said in response to a reporter's question. Brito spoke with journalists after meeting with U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri who told reporters she would try to block the sale. When asked if InBev had reached out to shareholder Warren Buffett or Mexican brewer Grupo Modelo, Brito responded: "Right now, we're trying to engage with their (Anheuser-Busch) board, that's the top of the agenda." Brito has previously said he hoped for a friendly deal with Anheuser-Busch and would keep it in St. Louis, Missouri. (Reporting by  Richard Cowan )
