 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs had more trading risk in the second quarter, but earned less trading revenue, in a reflection of how difficult it is for even the best regarded investment banks to generate earnings growth now. 

 The company's value-at-risk, a measure of trading risk known as "VaR," rose 38 percent in the second quarter from the same quarter last year. That meant the bank had maximum potential losses of $184 million on 95 percent of the trading days in the quarter, up from $133 million a year ago. Meanwhile, trading revenue fell 16 percent from a year ago. It was Goldman's second straight quarter of higher VaR and lower trading revenue. That raised the eyebrows of some analysts and risk management experts, who wondered if Goldman is getting fully compensated for the risks it takes by trading on behalf of clients or for its own account. "It's dangerous for Goldman Sachs, because eventually, they're going to get it wrong. They're not omnipotent," said Christopher Whalen, managing director at Institutional Risk Analytics, a risk management advisory firm. Goldman Chief Financial Officer David Viniar said on a conference call that VaR rose because the investment bank reduced its positions, but its existing positions became riskier as markets fluctuated. When asked about the rise in VaR compared with the trading results, Goldman spokesman Lucas van Praag said on Tuesday: "I don't think one should read anything into it." And investors generally seem less concerned about risk at Goldman than at other banks. Goldman trades at about 1.8 times its book value, or the accounting value of its assets minus liabilities, while Lehman Brothers trades below book value. Goldman, the largest U.S. investment bank, is the only major broker that has not recorded a single quarterly loss during this credit crunch, a feat investors ascribe to its superior trading and risk management abilities. And VaR is a crude measure of risk, in part because it assumes returns follow a bell curve, which for many instruments is an invalid assumption. VaR accounts for Goldman's risk from both client trades and positions the investment bank takes with its own funds. Higher VaR does not necessarily mean Goldman is taking more trading risk with its own funds. If client trading is responsible for much of Goldman's value at risk, the investment bank may be using its relative strength to win market share. But caveats aside, having a higher VaR and lower trading returns does send up a warning flag, investors said. Even if Goldman does not post a big loss from trading, it could have more trouble generating earnings growth from the area, analysts said. "It's not a good thing. At the end of the day, while Goldman Sachs has performed well through tough periods, there's no guarantee that will continue," said James Ellman, president at hedge fund Seacliff Capital, which does not own Goldman shares.
