 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A former partner at the Milberg Weiss law firm sued three of his former colleagues on Tuesday, claiming that their actions in a massive kickback scheme caused him serious professional and financial harm. 

 John Richards, a partner at Milberg from May of 2000 until shortly after the firm was indicted in 2007, filed suit in U.S. District Court in New York against former partners Melvyn Weiss, Steven Schulman and William Lerach, all of whom are serving or awaiting jail time after pleading guilty. The suit comes a day after Milberg LLP, one of the best-known U.S. law firms specializing in shareholder litigation, agreed to pay $75 million and admit to wrongdoing by former partners to resolve a long-running criminal case. In the lawsuit, Richards argues that his career and financial interests have been seriously injured as the direct consequence of defendants' admitted unlawful and unethical course of conduct and that they willfully breached their duties to their partners. Richards, who is seeking a jury trial, claimed in court papers that the amount of damages and injuries he suffered is well in excess of $3 million. He is seeking actual damages in an amount to be determined at trial and punitive damages in excess of $1 million. The suit also asks that the defendants be forced to return unjust gains and the costs of their defense that were paid by the firm. Lerach is now serving a two-year federal prison term and Weiss is set to begin serving a 30-month sentence in August. Schulman, who cooperated with prosecutors, is awaiting sentencing. Richards, in the lawsuit, said that he and other partners not involved in the kickback scheme were repeatedly assured that accusations in an earlier 2005 indictment that involved partners in the firm "were untrue and politically motivated." Believing the assurances, the plaintiff continued to serve as partner, the suit said. Prior to the settlement announcement, the firm was set to go on trial in August on charges that it illegally paid $11 million in secret kickbacks to clients it represented in securities class-action cases. Under the deal, prosecutors found that current lawyers at the firm did not know about or participate in the kickbacks conspiracy perpetrated by several former partners who have since been indicted in connection with the scheme. "Defendants had a fiduciary duty to plaintiff and other Milberg Weiss partners to be honest and forthcoming with government authorities ... and had a duty to reveal their unethical and unlawful conduct to authorities and take personal responsibility for such conduct," the suit said. "Instead defendants refused to acknowledge the truth and continued to misrepresent the facts to government authorities, putting the firm and the financial and professional interests of plaintiff and other innocent Milberg Weiss partners in grave jeopardy," the suit said. After being disqualified from a case because of his association with Milberg Weiss following the firm's indictment, Richards said in the suit that he had no alternative in order to preserve his legal practice but to leave and join another firm.
