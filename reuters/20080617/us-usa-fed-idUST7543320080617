 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Market expectations for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates three or four times by the end of the year do not seem to match the balance of views within the Fed, the Financial Times said on Tuesday. 

 The FT said its online edition that while some Fed officials now saw a heightened "tail risk" on the inflation side and were calling for rapid rate normalisation, a second school of thought inside the Fed did not share this view. Tail risk refers to an outcome that is not likely to occur but would be very costly if it did, the paper said. "These officials still envisage raising rates as market strains ease, the growth outlook improves, and to offset any rise in expected inflation, leaving real rates unchanged. But the pace of rate increases they anticipate is considerably slower than the first group," the newspaper said. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke may stand somewhere between these two schools of thought, the paper said. "But he is likely to share at least a good part of the Fed doves' thinking," it said. "The market, meanwhile, appears to be taking its cue from the first group. Since the second group is influential, this could turn out to be a mistake," the newspaper said. U.S. short-term interest rate futures show that investors now expect the Fed to raise interest rates, which now stand at 2.0 percent, by at least 0.75 percentage point by the end of this year.
