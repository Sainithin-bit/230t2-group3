 LONDON  (Reuters) - British Finance Minister Alistair Darling said on Tuesday it was vital for Britain to work with other countries to tackle soaring oil and food prices and bring down inflation. 

 As inflation reached its highest level in Britain in 11 years, Darling said high food and oil prices were a global problem which could only be solved through international action. "What we need to do is to make sure that we work with other countries to try and get those prices down because that is the only way we are going to get inflation down," Darling told reporters. "We are facing a problem which is affecting every country and we've got to act together to deal with it." (Reporting by  Matt Falloon  and Kate Kelland. )
