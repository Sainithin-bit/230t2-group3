 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - A boost to consumer spending from federal tax rebate checks will help the U.S. economy stay in positive territory over the next few months, said an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. 

 "We now anticipate stronger growth in the second and third quarters of the year as the drag from the housing sector lessens," Reuven Glick, group vice president, said in the San Francisco Fed's latest "FedViews" newsletter posted on their website on Tuesday. "After the fiscal stimulus package ends, we expect some payback with somewhat slower growth in the fourth quarter," Glick added. In the bank's previous newsletter released in early May, the San Francisco Fed had forecast negative growth in the second quarter. For 2009, U.S. GDP growth was forecast at an annual rate of about 3 percent, boosted by further improvements in the housing sector and an easing of credit constraints. Glick said that current five-month string of U.S. job losses was "not encouraging" but modest enough to suggest that the U.S. economy is not as weak as in prior downturns. "This number of job losses equals about half the average performance during the first five months of previous recessions," he said. Turning to prices, Glick said headline inflation could peak at more than 4 percent in the second and third quarters on the back of recent "unexpected" commodity price increases, before starting to wane as those price hikes level off or recede. However, "we expect core inflation to remain relatively stable, as slack in the economy absorbs additional price pressures," he said. The San Francisco Fed forecasts the headline personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index easing back to about 2 percent by late 2009, bringing it in line with the core PCE index, which excludes food and energy prices. In April the year-over-year core PCE price index was 3.2 percent, and the core index, which strips out food and energy costs, was up 2.1 percent. May's report is slated for release on June 27.
