 DETROIT  (Reuters) - U.S. automaker Chrysler LLC is suing 
Canadian auto parts maker Magna International Inc MGa.TO to 
recoup money it spent on a recall involving defective heated 
seats in minivans. 

  Chrysler filed the lawsuit in Oakland County court in 
Michigan, near Chrysler's headquarters, in February after 
exhausting all other option available "in the normal course of 
business," Chrysler spokesman Mike Palese said on Tuesday.  He declined to reveal the amount Chrysler is seeking from 
Magna, but said it was a "significant amount."  A lawyer for Magna did not immediately return a phone call 
seeking comment.  Chrysler recalled 161,500 1999-2001 model-year Dodge Grand 
Caravan and Chrysler Town & Country minivans in 2005 because of 
defective heated seats made by Magna.  The heating element in some of the seats overheated and 
burned through the fabric, Palese said.  "We are asking them to compensate us for the 
customer-service action," he said.  Chrysler has had a long and fruitful association with 
Magna, which had been one of the bidders for the automaker when 
it was for sale last year.  Magna builds vehicles on contract for Chrysler in its Graz, 
Austria, plant.  The lawsuit comes as Chrysler is battling a sharp slide in 
U.S. market share amid record high gas prices. The automaker, 
owned by private equity group Cerberus Capital Management, is 
hurting from a slump in demand for trucks and SUVs.  The automaker lost $1.6 billion in 2007.  In sharp contrast, Magna ended 2007 with one of the 
strongest balance sheets in the industry and net cash of $2.2 
billion.  (Reporting by  Poornima Gupta ; Editing by  Brian Moss )
