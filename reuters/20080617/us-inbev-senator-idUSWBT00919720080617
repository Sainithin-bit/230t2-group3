 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill said on Tuesday she would do everything possible to "stop the sale" of St. Louis-based Anheuser-Busch Cos Inc to rival brewer InBev NV. 

 McCaskill, a Democrat, said she met with senior officials of InBev in her office. Speaking with reporters after the meeting, McCaskill said she was unaware if Anheuser-Busch investor Warren Buffett has endorsed InBev's plan to buy Anheuser-Busch for $65 a share, or about $46.3 billion. The senator expressed concern about jobs and pension plans of workers now employed at Anheuser-Busch's operations in Missouri. (Reporting by  Richard Cowan , editing by Leslie Gevirtz)
