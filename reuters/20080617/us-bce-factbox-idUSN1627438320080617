 (Reuters) - The Supreme Court of Canada is hearing on Tuesday morning an appeal by BCE Inc. ( BCE.TO )( BCE.N ) of a lower court decision that imperils the telecom company's C$34.8 billion ($34.1 billion) buyout. 

 Here are some key facts about the case. THE COMPANY - BCE is Canada's largest communications company, parent of Bell Canada, with 54,000 employees and 800 million shares. - Its Toronto-listed shares closed at C$37.12 just before the May 21 Quebec court decision, and fell to a 52-week low of C$31.80 during the next day. Their 52-week high was C$41.80 last July 3, and they closed at C$33.53 on Monday. - Total debt is C$11.36 billion. Subtracting C$2.48 billion in cash/cash equivalents leaves net debt of C$8.88 billion. - It has an operating margin of 21.13 percent. THE PROPOSED BUYOUT - Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, with U.S.-based private equity firms Providence Equity Partners, Madison Dearborn Partners and Merrill Lynch Global Private Equity, are offering C$42.75 a share to take BCE private. - It would be the largest leveraged buyout in history. DEADLINES - The offer must receive court approval by June 30. - Bondholders who oppose the deal say this deadline could be extended if the purchaser, company and banks agree, but it is far from certain that a new deal could be reached. For one thing, the banks want to improve their terms and could seek to delay the transaction if they do not get their way. CENTRAL ISSUES - The case turns on whether corporate boards in takeover situations have a duty to their shareholders only, or also to bondholders and other stakeholders. - The Quebec Court of Appeal blocked the buyout on the grounds that the BCE board failed to take into account the interests of bondholders in backing a deal with substantially increased debt. - BCE argues that decision puts directors "in a position of irreconcilable conflict" in having to weigh interests of shareholders and debtholders beyond contractual obligations. BCE BONDS - The bondholders say the proposed buyout has cut the value of their bonds by 18 percent, partly because two rating agencies had downgraded Bell Canada debentures from investment grade to junk status. SUPREME COURT HEARING - The oral hearing began at 9 a.m. EDT (1300 GMT) Tuesday. - BCE and the bondholders will each have one hour, and then five minutes each for replies at the end of the morning. - Two interveners will have 10 minutes each. - The court could take a mid-morning break or a quick recess at the end of the hearing. It should all be concluded by noon or 12:30 p.m. POSSIBLE OUTCOMES - The court could rule from the bench, most likely after a break at the end of the oral hearings, either in favor of BCE or against. - It could reserve its decision for a later date. A date is usually not given but a decision would most likely be rendered before June 30. PRECEDENT - The Quebec court relied heavily on the Supreme Court of Canada's 6-0 judgment in 2004 in the Peoples case, which dealt with a corporate acquisition in which the buyer and the company purchased went bankrupt. - BCE bondholders point to language in that case that says "the best interests of the corporation" should be read not simply as "the best interests of the shareholders". - BCE points to Peoples language that says there is no need to read the interest of creditors into directors' duty to act in the best interests of the corporation. BCE also notes that Peoples deals with insolvency and BCE is not insolvent. ($1=$1.02 Canadian) (Reporting by  Randall Palmer ; Editing by  Bernadette Baum )
