 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc's LEH.N shares dropped 7.6 percent on Tuesday, as earnings from rival Goldman Sachs Group ( GS.N ) showed how difficult the future could be for Lehman, analysts said. 

 Goldman said on Tuesday that its second fiscal quarter earnings fell 11 percent. On Monday, Lehman said it lost $2.8 billion in the fiscal quarter ended May 31. Among Goldman's stronger areas were commodities and currencies trading, which make up a smaller portion of Lehman's business. "A few markets where Lehman is stronger just aren't doing as well," said Bill Fitzpatrick, an analyst covering financial stocks at Optique Capital Management, which does not own Lehman shares. Lehman shares fell $2.06 to close at $25.14 on Tuesday, and have fallen about 60 percent this year. The stock trades at less than 0.8 percent of its book value, implying that investors see more write-downs ahead for the bank, even after the $3.7 billion of write-downs it recorded on Monday. Financial stocks broadly fell on Tuesday, with Goldman dropping 1.46 percent and Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) down 4 percent. Morgan Stanley will report earnings on Wednesday. On days when brokerage stocks have fallen in recent months, Lehman has tended to decline the most. A spokesman for Lehman declined to comment. (Reporting by  Dan Wilchins , editing by Richard Chang)
