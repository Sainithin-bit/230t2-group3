 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury debt prices rallied on Tuesday as press reports indicated that, contrary to the view the market adopted last week, the Federal Reserve is not ready to raise interest-rates soon. 

 Data showing a drop in U.S. housing starts and a higher-than-expected rise in wholesale inflation in May had scant impact on a market focused on news reports indicating that expectations for tighter monetary policy this year had been exaggerated. "A lot of articles in the past couple of days" seem to be saying "that the market has placed too much (emphasis) on Fed rate hikes in months to come," said Sean Murphy, Treasury trader at RBC Capital markets in New York. Two-year yields, which are especially sensitive to shifting perceptions on the near-term outlook for Fed monetary policy, suffered their biggest one-day drop in three months as investors "curbed their enthusiasm" for as many as three Fed interest-rate hikes by the end of the year. Two-year Treasury notes jumped 7/32, their yields easing to 2.92 percent from 3.04 percent on Monday. Last week, yields on two-year notes posted their sharpest weekly rise in 26 years as anti-inflation talk from the Fed and other central banks persuaded the market that the Fed could raise rates two or three times before the end of the year. Gary Thayer, senior economist at Wachovia Securities in St. Louis, Missouri, said Tuesday's reports showing a 3.3 percent drop in housing starts in May and another showing a 1.4 percent rise in wholesale inflation demonstrated that the Fed had to monitor both the downside risks to the economy and the inflation outlook carefully. The twin considerations mean that the Fed "will hold rates steady for the time being," he said. "The Fed's bark is worse than its bite as we approach midyear," said William Sullivan, chief economist at JVB Financial Group in Boca Raton, Florida, referring to comments on global inflation by central bank officials last week that prompted debt markets to position for near-term rate hikes. "There still are appreciable downside risks for the economy and the credit environment remains fragile so tightening monetary policy would be a real problem," he said. "This is not an environment where the Fed can start withdrawing liquidity. An unexpected 0.2 percent decline in U.S. industrial production in May pointed to weak economic activity. Meanwhile, the amount of capacity used in that production declined, foreshadowing a possible easing of inflation pressures. Stock market losses, with shares of financial services companies under pressure, were also supportive for Treasuries. In midday trade, benchmark 10-year Treasury notes US10YT=RR were up 18/32 in price, their yields easing to 4.21 percent from 4.27 percent on Monday.
