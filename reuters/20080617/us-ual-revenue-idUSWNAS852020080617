 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - UAL Corp UAUA.O, parent of United Airlines, said on Tuesday that its second-quarter mainline passenger unit revenue is likely to show an increase 4 and 5 percent year-over-year. 

 The parent of the No. 2 U.S. airline said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it expects its mainline jet fuel price to average $3.31 per gallon for the second quarter. The company said its operating costs, excluding fuel, likely will show a rise of 3 to 3.5 percent in the quarter. (Reporting by Kyle Peterson, editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
