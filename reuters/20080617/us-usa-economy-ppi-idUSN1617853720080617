 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Record-high crude oil costs sent wholesale inflation soaring in May, but a key gauge of underlying price pressures likely moved ahead at a slower pace than the month before, according to a Reuters poll. 

 The producer price index -- a gauge of prices paid at the farm gate and factory door -- will likely rise a steep 1 percent in May after a 0.2 percent rise the previous month, according to a median forecast of 83 economists. After stripping out volatile food and energy costs, producer prices are expected to climb a moderate 0.2 percent after gaining 0.4 percent in April. Oil prices, which have risen nearly 40 percent this year and hit then-record highs above $130 a barrel in May, and rising food costs have squeezed consumers. Nationwide average U.S. gasoline prices are above $4 a gallon for the first time. "High commodity prices are posing a significant strain on U.S. households," the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said last week. Bush administration officials say that soaring oil use has outstripped suppliers' ability to keep up. Many Democrats in Congress blame speculators. The following is a selection of comments from economists: BANK OF TOKYO-MITSUBISHI UFJ PPI +1.2 PCT CORE +0.2 PCT Oil prices will be the biggest determinant of wholesale and consumer inflation going forward, and despite the fluctuations that may occur in speculation activity, the fact of the matter remains that fundamental drivers will keep oil prices high for the foreseeable future. GLOBAL INSIGHT PPI +1.6 PCT CORE +0.3 PCT We expect producer prices to surge 1.6 percent in May as gasoline prices record their first double-digit percentage gain since November 2007. Natural gas, electricity and fuel oil prices will also provide substantial upward pressure to the top line. WACHOVIA PPI +1.0 PCT CORE +0.1 PCT Producers are facing elevated price pressures in today's environment and the Fed is rightfully concerned that higher inflation expectations are taking hold with businesses and consumers.
