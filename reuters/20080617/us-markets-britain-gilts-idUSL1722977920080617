 LONDON  (Reuters) - British gilts and interest rate futures rallied sharply on Tuesday after the Bank of England indicated a deteriorating inflation outlook was unlikely to lead to hasty interest rate rises. 

 In a letter to the government to explain why inflation had risen to 3.3 percent in May -- more than a percentage point above target -- Bank Governor Mervyn King said the future path of interest rates was "uncertain". He stressed that the majority of the rise in inflation was due to higher oil and commodity prices rather than domestic spending. "The Governor did not rule out a rate rise, but his letter calmed interest rate markets and reinforced a sharp rally," said Philip Shaw at Investec. Interest rate futures have been pounded in recent weeks as investors have warmed to the view that interest rates will need to rise sharply to curb inflation. At 7:25 a.m. EDT, short sterling futures were up by 30 ticks in contracts from March 2009 onwards, having fallen almost non-stop over the past month. The September gilt future was 41 ticks higher at 104.19, outperforming the equivalent Bund. At the start of the week markets were pricing in a quarter-point rate hike by September. Now a rate hike is not fully priced in till November. "The Bank of England seems to be saying that it will keep interest rates on hold for now," said Richard McGuire, fixed income strategist at RBC. "Many market participants had short positions in UK interest rate markets, so positioning may have played a part in the rally." Gilts and short sterling interest rate futures had already got off to a good start. A front-page Financial Times story suggested market expectations that the Federal Reserve would boost rates three or four times this year did not match the view within the bank.  Bunds also got a lift after European Central Bank Executive Board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi said a quarter-point rate hike should be enough to bring inflation below ECB's 2 percent target. "There's a lot of playing down of rate hike expectations," said one London-based trader. "It smacks of a deliberate media assault." (Reporting by  Christina Fincher ; Editing by Ruth Pitchford)
