 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co plans to close a Michigan plant that builds large sport utility vehicles for nine weeks as demand for the vehicles has declined amid record high U.S. gas prices. 

 The Michigan Truck plant in Wayne, Michigan, which makes the Lincoln Navigator and Ford Expedition, will be idled starting Monday until August 25, Ford spokesman Mark Truby said on Tuesday. "We are seeing less demand in the large truck and large SUV market right now," Truby said. Consumers are spurning pickup trucks and SUVs and moving to smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles. Both the Navigator and Expedition are two of Ford's largest SUVs. U.S. Navigator sales fell 37 percent in May, while Expedition sales were down 43 percent. Ford has said it plans to increase car production and decrease the output of trucks to better align its line-up to market demand. The company plans in July to update investors on its production plans. (Reporting by  Poornima Gupta ; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
