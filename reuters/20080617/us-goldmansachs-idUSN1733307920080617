 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc on Tuesday said quarterly earnings fell 11 percent as balky debt markets slowed investment banking activity and eroded trading profit, yet the results were encouraging during the worst environment seen in decades. 

 The largest U.S. investment bank reported net income of $2.09, or $4.58 a share, for the fiscal second quarter ended May 31, down from $2.33 billion, or $4.93 a share, a year earlier. Analysts' average forecast was $3.42 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. The following is reaction from industry analysts and investors: THOMAS RUSSO, PARTNER AND PORTFOLIO MANAGER AT GARDNER  RUSSO & GARDNER, IN LANCASTER, PENNSYLVANIA: "They have an uncanny ability to stay out of trouble. One of the lessons that has come forth during all this is you can't know whether a bank has trouble ahead. One defense against trouble is corporate culture, and Goldman has shown they have retained a highly unusual degree of discipline in their culture." STEVE GOLDMAN, MARKET STRATEGIST, WEEDEN & CO, GREENWICH,  CONNECTICUT "They continue to do the right thing. They continue to meet expectations and hats off to them. They're doing a brilliant job. They've been the best and continue to shine." JIM PAULSEN, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER AT WELLS CAPITAL  MANAGEMENT IN MINNEAPOLIS "Goldman has always been one that hasn't been as close to the trouble as some of the others. But the story is good and it adds fuel to the argument that the financial arena is getting back to the business of making money."
