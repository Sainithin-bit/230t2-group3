 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Belgian beermaker InBev said on Tuesday that it was "committed to fully explaining" its strategy for growing and preserving the heritage of U.S. rival Anheuser-Busch to all shareholders. 

 In an emailed statement, InBev said it had "the highest respect for Anheuser-Busch, its employees, its leadership and the communities they operate in". It said that meetings being held were part of explaining its strategy. InBev announced its unsolicited bid last week and has not yet received a formal answer from Anheuser-Busch's board.
