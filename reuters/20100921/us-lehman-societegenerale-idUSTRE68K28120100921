 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEHMQ.PK is seeking to settle a dispute with the New York branch of French bank Societe Generale and says if it is approved it could recover at least $445 million for a unit of the bankrupt investment firm. 

 Lehman, which collapsed in September 2008 in the largest-ever U.S. bankruptcy, is asking a New York court to approve a settlement related to swap transactions with two special purpose entities. In 2006, Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc had purchased credit protection from the special purpose entities, called "Libra" and "Vela". The agreements were terminated early and Lehman has challenged the validity of the terminations. By settling the disagreement, Lehman says it can cut the risks and expenses stemming from extended litigation. "If the settlement agreement is approved, LBSF's estate is likely to recover at least $445 million and preserve the right to pursue the remaining assets in Libra and Vela against the other parties to the transactions, thereby maximizing its opportunity to potentially recover up to an additional approximately $72 million," Lehman said in court documents filed late on Monday. Additionally, the settlement would give the Lehman unit a better chance of getting the prompt return of an additional $128 million in posted capital, the company said.
