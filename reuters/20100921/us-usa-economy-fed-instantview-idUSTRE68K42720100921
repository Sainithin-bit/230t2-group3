 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve said on Tuesday it stood ready to provide additional support to bolster a modest economic recovery, suggesting it may be preparing to do more to keep unemployment from rising and prices from falling. 

 KEY POINTS: * The U.S. central bank made no shift in monetary policy at the end of a one-day meeting, although it expressed somewhat greater concern about the sluggish pace of economic growth and uncomfortably low inflation than it had when it last met in August. * "The committee will continue to monitor the economic outlook and financial developments and is prepared to provide additional accommodation if needed to support the economic recovery and to return inflation, over time, to levels consistent with its mandate," the Fed said in a statement. * Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank President Thomas Hoenig dissented for a sixth consecutive time. COMMENTS: BILL O'NEILL, PARTNER AT LOGIC ADVISORS, UPPER SADDLE RIVER, NEW JERSEY: "I think the gold bulls really got what they wanted from thisFed policy statement. What the Fed said is certainly leaning toward a QE 2. Even though there's no fear of inflation, they actually showed a fear for deflation, which is lso bullish for gold as it creates uncertainties. It looks like we are onward and upward to $1,300." PAUL DALES, U.S. ECONOMIST, CAPITAL ECONOMICS, TORONTO: "For the first time, (the Fed) acknowledged that core inflation is lower than it would like and, in response, it said it is 'prepared to provide additional accommodation if necessary.'" WILLIAM LARKIN, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, CABOT MONEY MANAGEMENT, SALEM, MASSACHUSETTS: "If you look at the fed funds futures, the Fed is on hold for a long period of time. "(The statement) impacted the two-year Treasury (yield) which is trading close to a record low. "The statement gave a sober, realistic outlook for the economy which is definitely a positive for corporate bonds, because a slow, gradual recovery is optimal. BUCKY HELLWIG, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, BB&T WEALTH MANAGEMENT, BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA: "It's more of the same, they're going to continue to be accommodating. They're not going to shrink the balance sheet, that's probably the most important take away. "The market was down and now we're flat, so I think investors are pleased that they're not taking anything off the table yet." ZACH PANDL, ECONOMIST, NOMURA SECURITIES, NEW YORK: "The FOMC has teed-up an easing at the November meeting. It chose to clarify more its assessment of the economy but clearly established a strong easing bias. "The markets are still just digesting what this means. People were placing some bets there could be some shock and awe quantitative easing today. That is obviously not going to happen. "We think the most likely out come is they will begin an incremental easing program starting at the November meeting. "The key is the committee has a lot of discomfort about the rate of growth in the economy today but we think it bought some time with the improvement in market conditions over the last couple of weeks. "The fact that the Fed is on the case will generally be positive for riskier assets like equities. The FOMC sees growth but would like to see it move a little bit faster so they are willing to ease as needed, and that's ultimately positive for equity markets." OMAIR SHARIF, U.S. ECONOMIST, RBS SECURITIES, STAMFORD, CONNECTICUT: "They kept the economic paragraph relatively similar to last time; the key here is they're expressing a little more concern about inflation than they have of late. "They've changed that (inflation sentence) from simply saying underlying measures of inflation have been trending lower. "Any further disinflation is not going to be tolerated by the Fed. It's even more important now when we  talk about the Fed's 2011 forecast to look at core inflation. That seems to be the one trigger for the Fed's point of view that's going to push them into QE." KIM RUPERT, MANAGING DIRECTOR OF GLOBAL FIXED INCOME ANALYSIS, ACTION ECONOMICS LLC, SAN FRANCISCO "I think they certainly opened the door for more QE. They were pretty dovish on their outlook on prices and they suggested that the recovery is still pretty anemic. They didn't come right out and say it but I think if conditions don't improve from here that they could pull the trigger on more QE pretty soon -- I think at the next meeting or December." BRUCE MCCAIN, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, KEY PRIVATE BANK, CLEVELAND, OHIO: "The Fed's statement was extremely tilted toward additional easing down the line. In particular, they see inflation as being below where it needs to be to fulfill their mandate. That comes as close to saying they're going to ease without explicitly saying they're going to ease." JOE MANIMBO, CURRENCY TRADER, TRAVELEX GLOBAL BUSINESS PAYMENTS, WASHINGTON D.C: "Bottom line, the Fed may have to do more in terms of stimulus before the end of the year and that is obviously pushing yields lower. In turn it makes returns on dollar-denominated assets even less attractive." DOUG ROBERTS, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CHANNEL CAPITAL RESEARCH, SHREWSBURY, NEW JERSEY: "My initial thought was I didn't think they'd do anything with QE, but I thought they'd make some allusion to it. Basically the thing that strikes me is they didn't say anything about it at all, which is kind of unusual and leads me to believe there's probably not a great deal of consensus going on within the Fed as to what to do. I guess probably the biggest thing in the statement that surprised me was the omission. "With the stock market, you have a lot of short-term traders betting on the news, so you need to look and see where the market closes by the end of the day because of lot of stuff in-between is a lot of short-term traders positioning. At this point, the market may be breathing a sigh of relief that it's over with." MAX BUBLITZ, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, SCM ADVISORS, SAN FRANCISCO: "It was pretty much as everybody expected, or at least as I expected. What was going on there is that people were pricing in the option that they could actually do something today and it didn't happen. At the end of the day, what is going on is that burden of proof has changed. For the last six months or so the assumption was that the economy was gradually improving and data would support that. Well, that hasn't been the case so what has been priced in is something in the fourth quarter. But they laid the groundwork, he did it in Jackson Hole, they basically said it today. So that is being priced into the stock market and we are off and headed toward QE2. "Maybe the headlines might have shocked some people but when you actually read the statement you can't be surprised what is in there, it's pretty much what he has been saying." NICK BENNENBROEK, HEAD OF FX STRATEGY, WELLS FARGO, NEW YORK: "Overall, the Fed statement is dovish. It seems that the Fed is a little concerned that inflation is lower than what they're comfortable with. And they're prepared to provide additional stimulus. It seems that the U.S. economy is at that point where the Fed is actually closer to easing monetary policy. So we have seen the dollar sell off against the euro." JAY MUELLER, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER WITH WELLS CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN: "The statement was basically as expected. They are not concerned about inflation. They are not changing anything. They are willing to do more, which we assume would be some form of quantitative easing, should it be necessary. "We still have the extended period, we still have inflation likely to remain subdued. It is almost exactly what I expected. "I think they are concerned about financial conditions being too tight to allow the unemployment rate to come down." MOHAMED EL-ERIAN, CO-CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER AT PACIFIC INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT CO., NEWPORT BEACH, CALIF.: "The Federal Reserve has taken another step, albeit a half step, in recognizing the unusually sluggish economic and employment outlook and related need for additional policy measures."
