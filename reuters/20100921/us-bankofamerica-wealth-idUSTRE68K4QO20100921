 CHARLOTTE, North Carolina  (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) said on Tuesday its Latin American wealth chief will retire in November and will be replaced by the head of its corporate and investment bank in the region. 

 Brian Sepe, 58, head of BofA's Latin American wealth and investment management, will be replaced by Sonia Dula, currently head of Bank of America's Latin American corporate and investment banking. Dula, 49, will report to global wealth chief Sallie Krawcheck and Andrea Orcel, executive chairman for global banking and markets. Dula joined Bank of America in 2006, and has overseen the integration of Bank of America and Merrill's Latin American investment banking operations. Since 2009, she has also managed the expansion of Bank of America's Latin American corporate banking unit. In the new role, Dula will manage all Latin American financial advisers. Dula's successor as head of Latin American investment banking will be named shortly, the bank said. She replaces a Merrill executive with a three-decade tenure at the company. Sepe joined Merrill Lynch in 1979 as a financial adviser. He moved into management in 1992 in Merrill's private wealth group. Over the last two years, he has held two different posts within Merrill's adviser business. In 2008, he ran the company's U.S. Northeast division. After the merger with Bank of America in 2009, he became head of Latin America wealth management. Bank of America shares closed down 0.7 percent on the New York Stock Exchange at $13.65.
