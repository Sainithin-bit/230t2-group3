 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co Chief Executive Robert Iger said the company has struck deals to collect additional cash from television station affiliates after negotiating higher fees from cable operators, most recently Time Warner Cable. 

 Time Warner Cable and Disney had clashed over "retransmission fees" that Time Warner would pay Disney to carry free-to-air ABC broadcast signals on their cable systems. Disney owns ABC. Owners of TV stations have sought to claw back more fees as viewers migrate to cable, the Internet and video games. Disney and other big station owners like News Corp are also demanding payments from TV stations not owned by big media companies, but which are affiliated with major networks. Analysts estimate that Time Warner may pay as much as $1.28 billion to Disney and its affiliate stations under the deal. "We expect to see a portion of retransmission fees" from affiliates, Iger told investors at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia conference in New York. "We've struck some deals with affiliates to gain access for fees and are in negotiation with others. Retrans payments are real and will grow and there is no incremental cost to get them," said Iger. DEATH OF TV, MOVIES OVERPLAYED Disney, which owns the ESPN sports cable network and Pixar studio, said it had suffered no loss of subscribers as a result of the Internet, nor cannibalization of DVD sales because of low-cost DVD renters like Coinstar Inc's Redbox. Other studios have sought to delay making films available to Redbox for 30 days to preserve sales. He said Disney's DVD business is heavily skewed toward kids and that people frequently buy, not rent DVDs because families tend to view them again and again. Iger also said he has also seen no evidence of "cord-cutting" or dropping of pay-TV subscriptions to watch shows over the Internet. "The channel business is not only alive and well, but actually much healthier than people suggest," he said. "I think its far too premature to write the epitaph" for channel television and multichannel television, he said, but also noted that Disney saw Web-connected TV as an opportunity, citing the new ESPN3.com Web services as an example. He said Internet connected TV will create challenges, but will also enable Disney to make more product available to consumers and other content providers. "We are very mindful of products that we make available," for the Internet direct experience, he said. Overall investors and Wall Street underappreciates Disney's brand value, Iger said.
