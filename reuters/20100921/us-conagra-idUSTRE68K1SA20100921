 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - ConAgra Foods Inc ( CAG.N ) reported lower-than-expected quarterly earnings and cut its full-year forecast, hurt by a price war and rising commodity costs, sending its shares down more than 5 percent. 

 ConAgra, which makes well-known U.S. brands like Hebrew National hot dogs, Healthy Choice frozen dinners and Chef Boyardee canned pasta, has been competing fiercely with other food manufacturers to attract consumers who are preparing more of their own meals in a weak economy. ConAgra cited material costs that rose faster than the company's efforts to curb expenses and promotions that were more aggressive than anticipated. In particular, the company spent more on promotions for such products as frozen foods and popcorn in the quarter, but did not see the boost to sales it had expected as a result. Morningstar analyst Erin Swanson said ConAgra's inability to fuel sales with increased promotions was "troubling" and showed the company's brands occupy a weak competitive position versus peers such as Kellogg Co ( K.N ), HJ Heinz Co HNZ.N and General Mills Inc ( GIS.N ), which reports results on Wednesday. Shares of those rivals also fell on Tuesday, with Kellogg down 1.3 percent at $50.18 on the New York Stock Exchange and Heinz down 1.7 percent. "We expect that intense competitive pressures will persist and that promotional spending will remain a key theme across the category over the next several quarters," Swanson said. "However, whether this spending generates the necessary volume leverage is something that we will be paying attention to." ConAgra forecast a rise in full-year profit, excluding items, of 5 to 7 percent from the $1.74 per share it earned in fiscal 2010, which ended May 30. Its prior outlook called for growth of 8 to 10 percent. With expectations for a modest decline in earnings in the current second quarter, ConAgra said all of the year's earnings growth would occur in the back half. But ConAgra raised its dividend by 15 percent and affirmed its long-term target for annual earnings growth of 8 to 10 percent -- both signs of management's confidence in its performance beyond 2011. ConAgra shares were down $1.20 or 5.4 percent at $21.17 in midday trading, a level Swanson called "fairly priced," given the company's near-term hurdles. GROWTH EXPECTED LATER THIS YEAR Quarterly sales fell 2 percent in ConAgra's consumer foods business, which supplies retailers and other food service outlets and made up 65 percent of total sales. The segment's sales volume fell 3 percent, and pricing declined 1 percent, hurt by promotions and greater demand for lower-priced goods. Operating profit fell 14 percent. In the commercial foods segment, sales fell 3 percent and profit declined 17 percent, as the Lamb Weston potato operations suffered because of last year's poor-quality crop. Chief Executive Officer Gary Rodkin said this was "a tough quarter, but not reflective of our current expectations for the full fiscal year or beyond." Net income fell to $146.4 million, or 33 cents per share, in the first quarter ended on August 29 from $165.9 million, or 37 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, earnings were 34 cents per share, missing the analysts' average estimate of 39 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net sales fell 2.4 percent to $2.82 billion, below the $2.96 billion that Wall Street had expected. Rodkin said ConAgra was confident its financial performance would improve later this fiscal year, due to benefits from new products and recent acquisitions, a new potato crop, plans to boost productivity and more-effective promotions. He said the company has already seen positive developments recently, including shipment trends in the consumer foods business that have "broadly and gradually improved over the past six to eight weeks" and "signs that the restaurant industry has started to pick up again".
