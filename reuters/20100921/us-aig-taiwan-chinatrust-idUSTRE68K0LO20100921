 TAIPEI  (Reuters) - Chinatrust Financial ( 2891.TW ) will bid for American International Group's ( AIG.N ) Taiwan unit Nan Shan Life again if the U.S. insurer puts it back on the market, Chinatrust's president said on Tuesday. 

 Chinatrust, Taiwan's top credit card issuer and a losing bidder for Nan Shan in 2009, would buy Nan Shan alone, president Daniel Wu told Reuters. "We want to, and need to know what AIG's next move will be," Wu said. "We would bid for Nan Shan by ourselves ... via either selling shares or bonds." Chinatrust's comments came after China Strategic ( 0235.HK ) said on Monday that it and partner Primus Financial Holdings have ended their $2.2 billion purchase agreement with AIG for Nan Shan. Last month Taiwan regulators blocked a bid for Nan Shan from battery maker China Strategic and Primus, saying the two did not have experience in the insurance industry and lacked the ability to raise capital for future operations. Shares of China Strategic plunged more than 6 percent in midday Hong Kong trading. Nan Shan is Taiwan's No.3 life insurer by market share and its policyholders make up almost a sixth of the island's population. (Reporting by Faith Hung; editing by  Jonathan Standing )
