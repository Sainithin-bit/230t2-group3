 LONDON (Reuters) -Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan has said intervention in the foreign exchange markets would be "unavoidable" if there is drastic change in the currency. 

 Japan last week carried out its first intervention in six years to stem economic damage from the surging yen that shot up to a 15-year high against the dollar. In an interview with the Financial Times published on Wednesday, Kan said Tokyo also plans to create a "total" package of measures that will expand domestic demand and help to weaken the currency. "I think it is necessary to combine economic policy and monetary policies that will be conducive to...(a yen exchange rate) slightly lower than the current level," Kan said. One possibility is to use the yen's strength to invest in natural resources overseas, he told the newspaper. Kan, who is in New York this week for a U.N. General Assembly meeting, said there was a "common recognition" among G20 nations that overly rapid currency movements were undesirable, and that he would seek to defend Japan's action. He also waved aside suggestions that Japan's intervention would make it harder to persuade China to allow the renminbi to rise against the dollar, saying the two issues "are completely different."
