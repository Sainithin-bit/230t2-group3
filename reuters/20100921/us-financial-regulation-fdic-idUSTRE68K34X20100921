 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. banking regulators will vote on Monday on how the government would dismantle large financial companies on the verge of collapse. 

 The vote at a Federal Deposit Insurance Corp board meeting will be on a rule that would take effect immediately, but also would allow the agency to gather more comments. FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair said last month that she wants to move quickly on this authority, arguing it is key to preventing future government bailouts of the financial industry. Under the law, the government would designate certain financial companies as systemically important. That means the collapse one of those companies could threaten the financial system. The FDIC has the power to seize and break them up if they are heading toward collapse. The FDIC is charged with liquidating these institutions much as it does with banks that take deposits. The new authority is part of an effort to end the notion that certain institutions are "too big to fail." As part of this new authority, large financial institutions must write living wills that regulators would use to dismantle them if they became insolvent. At a forum on the issue last month, financial representatives raised concerns about how creditors would be treated during a liquidation. The agency will also vote on whether to give federal protection to securitizations backed by home loans and other consumer debt if they meet higher standards and banks retain some of the risk associated with the products.
