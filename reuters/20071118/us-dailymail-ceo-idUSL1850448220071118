 LONDON  (Reuters) - British publishing group Daily Mail and General Trust DMGO.L ( DMGOa.L ) is set to announce internal candidate Martin Morgan as its new chief executive, The Sunday Times reported. 

 The newspaper said Morgan, currently in charge of the group's information division, would replace 59 year old Charles Sinclair when he retires next year. However, a source familiar with the situation said a decision on the succession had yet to be taken and that Morgan would be one of a few candidates in line for the job. The company declined to comment. It reports full year results on Wednesday. (Reporting by  John Bowker ; Editing by  David Holmes )
