 KLEINMOND, South Africa  (Reuters) - Finance chiefs from the Group of 20 countries agree that foreign exchange issues merit a joint approach and that erratic currency movements are unwelcome, French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde said on Sunday. 

 Lagarde said the currency discussion was part of talks on the global economy but no blame was laid on any particular currency, and the mostly industrialized and emerging economies of the G20 did not issue any statement on the dollar's weakness. "We discussed it on the occasion of the general discussion we had on macroeconomics and the overall discussion on the outlook and clearly that's one of the topics," Lagarde told reporters. She said that the Chinese yuan had been discussed, but added: "We all concurred that the currency situation is one that needs a joint approach, concerted approach. Clearly we don't want to point the finger at anyone and we want to operate by consensus." The dollar hit record lows against the euro and a basket of major currencies earlier this month as expectations grew the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates again next month to limit economic damage from the U.S. housing market downturn. Lagarde said that strong currencies, including the euro, had benefits and disadvantages for their economy. "You need the right balance and right equilibrium where there is not too much volatility and no erratic movements of currencies and that's what we are interested in." Lagarde said the impact on the global economy from the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis was still not clear. "The recent turbulence in the housing market and the subprime crisis clearly had an impact on the real estate portion of the U.S. economy but it remains to be seen what effect it has on the real economy," she said. "You listen to (Fed Chairman Ben) Bernanke and other officials, they all concur that fundamentals have not been affected ... As far as the underlying economy is concerned, there doesn't seem to be any effect as a result of the financial crisis." Lagarde added that the crisis had affected developed economies more than emerging countries. The impact on the world economy from the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis and the turmoil in global financial markets is expected to top the agenda for Group of 10 major and emerging market central bankers gathering in Cape Town for a two-day meeting that starts later on Sunday.
