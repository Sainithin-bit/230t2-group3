 KLEINMOND, South Africa  (Reuters) - The fall in the dollar is a move in the right direction but the euro and Canadian dollar were being overly burdened by the adjustment, International Monetary Fund Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn said on Sunday. 

 "The view of the IMF is that the move in the dollar depreciation is in the correct direction," Strauss-Kahn told reporters on the sidelines of a meeting of finance and central bank chiefs of the Group of 20 countries. Other currencies, particularly those backed by large current account surpluses, were not moving as they should, creating imbalances that were impacting on some units, including the euro. "Some currencies don't move as you would expect, mainly those countries that have large current account surpluses. Some are moving very slowly and some are moving in a bad direction and that is a serious concern," he said. "Another concern is that some countries have on their shoulders a much larger part of the adjustment than they should, the Canadian dollar obviously, and as is the case with the euro ... and the case for the Brazilian currency." Currency movements and global instability have been key issues at two days of talks of the G20 group of advanced and important emerging economies, particularly a weaker dollar and the inflexible Chinese yuan. The dollar has fallen almost 10 percent this year to record lows against a basket of major currencies as a global credit squeeze dampens growth, with the move hurting nations pegged to the U.S. unit. Meanwhile, the U.S. and Europe have urged that China allow the yuan to appreciate faster to try realign the massive U.S. current account deficit with Asian surpluses. Strauss-Kahn said the organization of the global foreign exchange system was not what it should be and that the IMF was the perfect institution to deal with the discussions about the imbalances. He also said oil prices -- which have neared $100 a barrel -- were a worry, as was the sharp rise in food prices globally. "We are all concerned by the move in oil prices and we are concerned by the recent move in food prices, which are creating a real problem for a lot of countries," Strauss-Kahn said, adding that no decision was taken at the meeting for action in this regard.
