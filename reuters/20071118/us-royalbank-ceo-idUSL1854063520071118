 LONDON  (Reuters) - Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc ( RBS.L ) Chief Executive Fred Goodwin has been informally approached by Citigroup Inc ( C.N ) to become its new chief executive, the Sunday Telegraph newspaper reported. 

 Citigroup is looking for a replacement for Charles Prince, who resigned two weeks ago after the U.S. bank admitted huge write-downs on mortgage-related investments. However, the report added that Goodwin was unlikely to leave RBS if offered the job. RBS declined to comment. (Reporting By John Bowker)
