 KLEINMOND, South Africa  (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund accepts it needs to reform to better reflect the current international environment and was confident of much progress soon, its managing director said on Friday. 

 "I think it is possible maybe to solve, or to make substantial progress, in the coming months," Strauss-Kahn told reporters on the sidelines of the annual meeting of the Group of 20 economic powers. The IMF has been given a deadline of its 2008 Spring meetings to effect quota reform. Emerging nations, who have demanded greater say in the running of the fund and its sister organization the World Bank, pressed for faster reform at the two-day meeting of the most advanced and important emerging economies. They say the votes and quotas within the two institutions are skewed in favor of rich countries and largely still reflect economic weightings of the end of World War Two. "As far as the fund is concerned, we are obviously at a crossroads ... we cannot act as we did 60 years ago, the world has changed," Strauss-Kahn said. Some countries had questioned whether the institution was still relevant, but recent developments showed it had an important role to play in the world economic order. "For even those that have bad memories, the need for an institution like the IMF is even more (now) than it was before," he said. But Strauss-Khan said the institutions needed to listen more closely to the views of member nations and added he believed the relevance and legitimacy of the fund had to be reshaped. All members accepted the need to give emerging economies more weight within the fund. "I think there is a willingness, it is very strong and I feel it among everyone," he said, though difficulties lay in persuading countries to give up some of their power. (Editing by  David Holmes )
