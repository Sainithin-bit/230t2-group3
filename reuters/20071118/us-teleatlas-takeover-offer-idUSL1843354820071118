 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - Dutch navigation device maker TomTom NV ( TOM2.AS ) will launch its agreed 30 euro per share takeover offer for digital map maker Tele Atlas NV TA.AS on Monday, the companies said. 

 The period in which Tele Atlas shareholders can tender their shares will begin on November 19 and end on December 18, the companies said in a joint statement on Sunday. TomTom's U.S. rival Garmin Ltd ( GRMN.O ) abandoned its attempt to buy Tele Atlas on Friday, clearing the way for TomTom to gain control of one of the only two global digital map makers. The other global map maker, Navteq Corp NVT.N, has agreed to be acquired by cell phone manufacturer Nokia Oyj ( NOK1V.HE ) for $8.1 billion. TomTom's bid, which values Tele Atlas at around 2.9 billion euros ($4.2 billion), is conditional on TomTom winning a total of 80 percent of Tele Atlas shares. It already holds a stake of about 28 percent. Tele Atlas will hold an extraordinary shareholders meeting on December 7 to discuss the offer. (Reporting by  Niclas Mika ; Editing by  David Holmes )
