 (Reuters) - The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) agreed its finance ministers would meet to discuss the sliding dollar after Iran and Venezuela recommended pricing oil against a currency basket. 

 -The world's top oil exporter Saudi Arabia blocked a proposal by Iran and Venezuela to include mention of the weak dollar in the final declaration at an OPEC heads of state summit on November 17-18. -Saudi Arabia and key Gulf producers the UAE and Kuwait price all of their oil in dollars. They supply around 16 percent of the world's oil. Anything that weakens the dollar will also hurt the region's massive dollar-weighted investments. -Most of the world's oil is priced in dollars. The world's largest oil futures exchanges the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and the InterContinental Exchange (ICE) both price oil in dollars. Most international oil contracts use dollar benchmarks for pricing. -Iran is the only OPEC member that has asked buyers of its oil for payment in non-dollar currencies. It gets about 70 percent of its oil revenues in other currencies, but the percentage varies monthly. The move by Iran was in part politically motivated as the row drags on with the United States over Tehran's nuclear ambitions. Following are key quotes on the dollar and its impact on oil producers' economies from a meeting of OPEC heads of state, energy and finance ministers in Riyadh.

But a consensus could not be reached," Bayan Jabor said. "Because the final communique was already drafted there was an agreement that OPEC finance ministers hold a meeting before the oil meeting in the UAE in December to discuss economic issues including the dollar's exchange rate."  SAUDI FOREIGN MINISTER "I think we should leave this matter to the competent parties... and not include it in the communique's draft," said Saud al-Faisal. "My fear is that any mention that OPEC makes of studying the issue of the dollar, will in itself have an impact." OPEC'S SECRETARY-GENERAL "Yes, we are concerned. But this is a discussion among ourselves and this is not the first time we have discussed it," Abdullah al-Badri said. QATAR'S ENERGY MINISTER "Today we feel concerned because of the very large decline in the value of the dollar. This has a very big impact on oil-exporting countries," Abdullah bin Hamad al-Attiyah said. Qatar's "purchasing power has fallen considerably," he said.  IRAN'S PRESIDENT "Today all leaders were unhappy with the fall in the value (of the dollar) ... even the American people have lost out," Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said. "They get our oil and give us a worthless piece of paper."  ECUADOR'S PRESIDENT "I'm completely in favour of pricing our oil in a stronger currency." ANGOLA'S FINANCE MINISTER "The meetings will analyse a series of issues that different leaders have raised during the discussions in Riyadh," Jose Pedro de Morais said of a series of planned meetings among OPEC oil, finance and foreign ministers. "There is a broad range of issues, the weakening dollar being one of them." "The conference did not discuss changing the pricing of oil sales. The future meetings will not include shifting to a new pricing mechanism in their agenda," VENEZUELA'S OIL MINISTER "A factor that is injecting instability in the market is the weakness of the dollar. It is making our oil prices vulnerable and making them look more expensive than it is in reality," Rafael Ramirez said. "Perhaps if oil was priced in euro, we wouldn't see the price situation that we are looking at now."  (Compiled by Dayan Candappa)
