 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Dow industrials ended the session in a bear market on Wednesday as U.S. stocks fell on growing concerns about the toll record oil prices are taking on the economy and corporate profits. 

  COMMENTS:  JAMES CARON, HEAD OF GLOBAL RATES RESEARCH, MORGAN STANLEY, NEW YORK: "We have one of the major central banks likely to raise rates tomorrow, and risk assets are responding. You are taking liquidity away when it is needed most. It's going to have consequences." "This is a dangerous game. There is a lot of stresses out there, but it's a balancing act. The ECB is erring on the side of inflation, and the Fed is erring on the side of growth."  GEORGES YARED, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, YARED INVESTMENT RESEARCH, MINNEAPOLIS: "Yes we're technically in a bear market now, but I don't see us going down all that much further from here. "The next thing to look out for is going to be a series of pre-announcements, but I think it will be interesting to see how much of that is baked in already."  MARC PADO, U.S. MARKET STRATEGIST AND TECHNICAL ANALYST, CANTOR FITZGERALD & CO, SAN FRANCISCO: "This is a capitulation of sorts. You've got volume 10 to 1 on the downside. Not big volume, but the ratio is very negative. I think we're seeing a capitulation of sorts and a sign that the market is really on its knees. The market needs a positive catalyst. It could be the jobs number. Crude has been a knife in our back and it keeps twisting."  KEITH HEMBRE, CHIEF ECONOMIST, FIRST AMERICAN FUNDS, MINNEAPOLIS, MINNESOTA: "The underlying reason is a very weak domestic economic environment that would not be conducive to profits meeting where consensus expectations have been. "The one added wrinkle that we really didn't anticipate but has added a furthering of downward pressure to equities in general has been the continued escalation of oil prices. "You've got pretty strong growth in the emerging markets, which has certainly been a support to earnings for these large companies in an environment where domestic demand growth has been weak. But it's also on the flip side been a very meaningful negative in that it has continued to drive oil prices up, which is a negative for the equity markets on a valuation basis." "Twenty percent (in the Dow industrials drop) is just kind of an artificial line in the sand. It's more a validation that all hell has already broken."  WILLIAM SULLIVAN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, JVB FINANCIAL GROUP, BOCA RATON, FLORIDA: "Let the bear market begin. Wow. Obviously a lot of this has to do with where we are in terms of the calendar. It's a holiday shortened week. We have a key piece of economic data tomorrow and it's a truncated trading session with stocks closing at 1 o'clock tomorrow and bonds at 2 o'clock. So there are concerns about liquidity. "Motivating the decline in stocks today was another super up-move in crude oil. Also, the labor market data that we received today pointed towards a weak June U.S. employment report tomorrow morning. The key data release was the ADP employment survey which suggested a drop of almost 79,000 in private payroll jobs. So it was a combination of the approaching a holiday weekend, a sharp run-up in energy, and indicators of a weak labor market that prompted the weak close in the Dow which qualifies as a bear market for that equity gauge."  ALEXANDER PARIS, PRESIDENT AND ECONOMIST, BARRINGTON RESEARCH, CHICAGO: "By the time you have seen 20 percent down you have seen a lot of the bear market already. The stock market is not very expensive. The market is very reasonably priced historically." "My guess is stocks will end the year higher than they are here."  SAMARJIT SHANKAR, DIRECTOR OF GLOBAL FX STRATEGY, BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON, BOSTON "Undoubtedly, the bear market raises red flags in terms of higher risk aversion and how much more volatility we have in store in the currency market. Recent relationships have shown a fair amount of correlation between equities and low yielders, and you may see some pressure on high-yielding currencies from emerging markets and even some high-yielders from developed markets such as the Australian and New Zealand dollars. In terms of flows, we've seen risk appetite hold up, but after today, you could see a knock-on effect in Asia, because those currencies have been hammered lately based on equity outflows. The yen and Swiss franc invariably do well when equities fall."  MATTHEW MOORE, ECONOMIC STRATEGIST, BANC OF AMERICA SECURITIES, NEW YORK: "The bear market is a signal that we've seen weak equity markets and movement into Treasuries as there have been fears about economic growth. We had a report out today showing the delinquency rate on home equity lines of credits is the highest in two decades. So consumers are under a great deal of stress here. With consumer spending two-thirds of the economy, economic growth looks kind of weak going forward, which is bad for stocks."
