 PARIS  (Reuters) - Former Airbus Chief Executive Gustav 
Humbert has been placed under formal investigation as part of a 
probe into allegations of insider trading at European aerospace 
group EADS ( EAD.PA ), a Paris judicial source said on Wednesday. 

  Humbert, a German national, was released on bail of 350,000 
euros ($552,500) on Wednesday following two days in police 
custody.  Humbert resigned in 2006 after the announcement of delays 
to the A380 superjumbo, which sharply hit the share price of 
Airbus' parent company EADS ( EAD.DE ). He is the third former 
executive to be questioned while in temporary police detention.  Former EADS co-chief executive Noel Forgeard and former 
international director Jean-Paul Gut were questioned under 
detention and placed under formal investigation last month.  Being placed under formal investigation in France is a step 
short of charges but can lead to trial.  French police are investigating claims that EADS top 
executives and industrial shareholders knew of the increasing 
threat of delays to the Airbus A380 superjumbo when they sold 
shares in 2005 and 2006.  The announcement of worsening delays in building the 
world's largest airliner wiped a quarter off the value of EADS 
shares on a single day in June 2006.  A total of 17 current and former executives, along with 
EADS shareholders Lagardere ( LAGA.PA ) and Daimler ( DAIGn.DE ), 
were cited in a recent report to prosecutors on suspected 
insider trading by France's market watchdog AMF.  ($1=.6335 Euro)  (Reporting by Benjamin Mallet, editing by Gerald E.
