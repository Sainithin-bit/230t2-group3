 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Landmark Communications could announce the sale of Weather Channel to a group made up of NBC Universal, Blackstone Group LP and Bain Capital in the next day or two, sources briefed on the matter said. 

 The final price on the cable network will range between $3 billion and $3.5 billion, but will likely be closer to $3.5 billion, the sources said. The parties have been negotiating directly with Landmark since Time Warner Inc withdrew its bid two weeks ago. There is always a small chance things could fall apart or slow down at the last minute, but absent any such unforeseen problems, the deal should be announced in the next couple days, one of the people said.
