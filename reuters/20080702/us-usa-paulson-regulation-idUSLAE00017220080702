 LONDON  (Reuters) - Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said on Wednesday the United States must find a way regulators can allow investment banks to fail without threatening the stability of the financial system. 

 Adding some flesh to his plan for the Federal Reserve to broaden its regulatory role in the wake of the Bear Stearns rescue, Paulson said his first priority was to maintain market stability amid the current turmoil, but he wants to move quickly to address regulatory deficiencies exposed by the credit crisis which began nearly a year ago. "In my view, looking beyond the immediate market challenges of today, we need to create a resolution process that ensures the financial system can withstand the failure of a large, complex financial firm," Paulson said in remarks to the Chatham House think tank in London. He said regulators including the Fed should have emergency authority to intervene to limit undue market disruptions caused by the failure of non-depository financial institutions. But he cautioned that to enforce market discipline and avoid the idea of a blanket government guarantee for Wall Street, "the trigger for evoking such authority should be very high, such as a bankruptcy filing." "Any commitment of government support should be an extraordinary event that requires the engagement of the executive branch" of government. "It should be focused on areas with the greatest potential for market instability and should contain sufficient criteria to ensure that the cost to taxpayers is minimized." STABILITY CZAR Paulson's remarks come amid debate over what additional regulation is needed after the Fed engineered a takeover of Bear Stearns by JPMorgan Chase & Co. ( JPM.N ), guaranteeing a $29 billion loan for the transaction out of concern that a Bear Stearns bankruptcy could trigger a financial panic. The Fed also started making emergency loans to investment banks for the first time since the Great Depression. Paulson last month said the Fed should be given permanent authority as a "market stability regulator" to make funds available to a broader range of financial institutions if the financial system's stability is deemed threatened. Paulson said he wants to avoid the perception that an institution is "too interconnected to fail or too big to fail" and added that "we must improve the tools at our disposal for facilitating the orderly failure of a large, complex, financial institution." But an "orderly" failure of a major Wall Street institution may be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve. "These things are always going to be messy. When you get a major investment bank going under, it's a huge news event that's going to be disruptive," said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist for RBS Greenwich Capital Markets in Greenwich, Connecticut. "The question is whether you can have a mechanism that allows them to fail if need be in a way that is not extraordinarily disruptive," Ruskin said. Paulson said simply subjecting insolvent Wall Street institutions to bankruptcy court could cause undue market disruptions, while using long-standing regulatory processes for unwinding commercial banks with insured deposits would encourage institutions to take on too much risk. GLOOM FOR ECONOMY Paulson, who was in London on the final leg of a five-day trip to Russia, Germany and Britain to discuss economic and trade issues with government officials, also said the U.S. economy was facing a "trio of headwinds" from high energy prices, capital markets turmoil and continuing home price declines that could prolong its economic slowdown. "Today, the U.S. economy is going through a rough period. And while we have seen better growth in Europe over the last few quarters, there are signs of a slowdown in Europe in general and the UK specifically," Paulson said. "However, emerging economies are expected to continue a period of strong growth, which will support global growth overall," he said. Answering questions after his speech, Paulson said global trade and financial imbalances were unhealthy and unsustainable and were due to inflexible exchange rates and the structural development of certain economies. Paulson's speech did not reveal any specific plans to ask Congress for legislation, which would be required for such changes. He and Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke are due to testify on July 10 on proposed regulatory changes before the U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee, one of the panels that would draft such a bill. The hearing is one of a series expected this summer on the state of the U.S. regulatory system, and Paulson's speech provided a preview of his expected testimony as the legislative process starts. He said an agreement between the Fed and Securities and Exchange Commission to share information on investment banks also would help inform the political process. (Editing by  Andrea Ricci )
