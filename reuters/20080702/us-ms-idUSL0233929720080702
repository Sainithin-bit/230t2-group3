 LONDON  (Reuters) - Marks and Spencer ( MKS.L ) issued a shock profit warning and said a consumer downturn was likely to be deeper and last longer than previously expected, sending its shares plunging over 20 percent to a near seven-year low. 

 The clothes, food and homewares group said on Wednesday sales at UK stores open over a year fell 5.3 percent in the 13 weeks to June 28 and its upmarket food business had lost market share as cash-strapped shoppers switched to cheaper rivals. In a trading update rushed out a week earlier than planned, it said Steven Esom, head of food, was leaving after just one year in the job and that it would look at more initiatives like its "Dine In for 10 pounds" campaign to lure back custom. Chairman Stuart Rose said the sales update was "effectively an earnings downgrade" and warned others would follow suit. "I can't believe this is a Marks & Spencer (M&S) exclusive problem, I think this is definitely a retail slowdown and we don't know where it's going," he told reporters. Kaupthing analysts agreed, and shares in rivals such as clothing group Next ( NXT.L ) and supermarket chain J Sainsbury ( SBRY.L ) also fell. "A raft of downgrades appears likely," they said. However, Panmure Gordon's Philip Dorgan said the "terrible" trading update was "at least half M&S specific," arguing its food business lacked scale, was threatened by premium ranges at supermarkets and was high price and also high cost. M&S's update adds to growing signs that indebted shoppers are cutting back on luxuries amid rising fuel, food and mortgage costs. Industry data from TNS Worldpanel last week showed that sales at discount supermarket group Aldi surged 21 percent in the 12 weeks to June 15 on the same period the year before, while more expensive rivals like M&S and Sainsbury lost ground. Rose said the consumer downturn was likely to be "longer and harder fought" than previously expected. "This is certainly going to go right through into 2009. There is absolutely no sign of relief," he said. Analysts slashed M&S profit forecasts for the year ending March 2009, which had stood around 870 million pounds, with some cutting to as low as 640 million. That compares with profits of over 1 billion pounds in the year ended March 2008. By 1000 GMT, M&S shares were down 18.5 percent at 259.25 pence, off a near seven-year low of 246.5 pence, and valuing the company at about 4.1 billion pounds. The cost of insuring M&S's debt against default also rose sharply, a trader said. TOUGH RUN M&S, which serves 21 million customers a week from over 600 stores in the UK, said like-for-like general merchandise sales fell 6.2 percent in the 13 weeks to June 28, but that it was holding market share in clothing and outperforming in homewares. Same-store sales in the group's food business were down 4.5 percent and Rose said M&S was losing market share here. John Dixon will replace Esom, a former Waitrose executive, as head of food, having worked in that business for several years before taking up his current post as head of homewares. Rose said Dixon would have a remit to look at how to adapt M&S's food offering to more price-conscious shoppers, but denied the company was going downmarket and ruled out introducing a budget range of foods. "We may have to, in the very, very intensive food price war that's going on at the moment, have a slightly different stance," he told analysts on a conference call, adding that this would focus as much on innovation as promotions. M&S shares have fallen around 60 percent over the past year and are trading well below the 400 pence level at which retail tycoon Philip Green attempted to buy the firm in 2004. Rose was brought in to defend M&S against that bid, and then presided over a recovery that lifted the shares to as high as 759p in April 2007. "I think we were a weak business in a strong market back in 2004. We're definitely a stronger business in a very weak market at the moment," Rose said. "We will come out of this, but in the meantime I think we're going to have a pretty tough run." He was "very confident" of being approved as executive chairman in a shareholder vote next Wednesday. Some shareholders expressed concern at Rose's move from chief executive to executive chairman, which was announced in May and runs counter to corporate governance guidelines. Corporate governance consultancy PIRC last week urged shareholders to vote against Rose's election. (Additional reporting by Richard Barley; Editing by David Cowell)
