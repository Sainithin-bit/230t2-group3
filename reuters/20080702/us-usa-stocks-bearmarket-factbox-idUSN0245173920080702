 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  sank into a bear market on Wednesday -- more than 20 percent below its record high close on October 9, 2007 -- after succumbing to the pressure of a housing slump, a credit crisis, record high oil prices and a weakening economy. 

 Since 1900, whenever the Dow has fallen into a bear market, it has on average shed 30 percent of its value for the duration of the slump. Bear markets have tended to last just over a year. The Dow's worst bear market occurred in the early years of the Great Depression and stretched from April 17, 1930, to July 8, 1932. The average lost 86 percent of its value in that period, falling from 294.07 to a bottom of 41.22. The following is a recap of the previous 10 bear markets for the Dow, according to Ned Davis Research, published in "The Stock Traders Almanac 2008": *March 19, 2002 to October 9, 2002 Dow's percentage loss: 31.5 percent Number of days it lasted: 204 What happened? WorldCom and Enron's accounting fraud sparked fears that more firms could be artificially boosting their bottom lines. *January 14, 2000 to September 21, 2001 Dow's percentage loss: 29.7 percent Number of days it lasted: 616 What happened? The bursting of the dot-com bubble, following a period of soaring stock prices and exuberant speculation on new Internet companies. The United States entered a brief recession in March 2001.

Inflation, thought to have been brought under control two years earlier, made a comeback, driving benchmark U.S. Treasury bond yields back to a peak near 14 percent by May 1984. April 27, 1981 to August 12, 1982 Dow's percentage loss: 24.1 percent Number of days it lasted: 472 What happened? Higher interest rates pushed economy into recession. September 8, 1978 to April 21, 1980 Dow's percentage loss: 16.4 percent Number of days it lasted: 591 What happened? Stagflation reached full maturity, with the annual inflation rate topping 14.5 percent by April 1980.
