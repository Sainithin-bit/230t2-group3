 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - UnitedHealth Group ( UNH.N ) on Wednesday slashed its full-year earnings outlook because of tough competition in the health benefits business and said it would pay more than $900 million to settle lawsuits related to past stock options practices. 

 But its shares rose more than 2 percent on hopes there may be no more bad news in a stock that has fallen some 55 percent so far this year on concerns about its prospects and operational missteps. "The market was expecting this," Edward Jones analyst Aaron Vaughn said of the lowered earnings forecast. "As it is now, they've taken their medicine, hopefully." Health-insurer shares, led by UnitedHealth, the largest U.S. health insurer by market value, have been under pressure all year amid a slew of earnings warnings related to problems in various lines of business. Shares of rivals WellPoint Inc ( WLP.N ) and Aetna Inc ( AET.N ) rose more than 4 percent and 2 percent, respectively, after UnitedHealth's announcement. Vaughn also said news of the settlement might be helping UnitedHealth shares, because "that's a chapter closed, so there's a positive benefit to that that you don't have this unknown liability hanging out there." UnitedHealth cut its earnings-per-share forecast to $2.95 to $3.05 before special items, down from an earlier outlook of $3.55 to $3.60. Wachovia analyst Matt Perry noted the health insurer has now cut its 2008 forecast about 25 percent from its original target of $3.95 to $4, including an earlier revision in April. The company said an intensely competitive commercial business environment was putting greater-than-expected pressure on premium yields. Its efforts to hold the line on premiums were also resulting in the company losing business. UnitedHealth cut its full-year forecast for membership by 100,000 in its commercial plans where it fully insurers employers, so that it now expects such membership to fall by 800,000 this year. UnitedHealth said it expected full-year revenue of $81 billion, in line with Wall Street estimates. "During the second quarter, our risk-based businesses produced a lower level of gross margin than expected, and we also experienced a continuation of the pressures we saw in the first quarter," Chief Executive Stephen Hemsley said in a statement. The Minnesota-based company also cited margin pressures from high costs in its special needs plans for seniors. Such special needs plans have represented most of UnitedHealth's membership growth under its Medicare business this year. But the benefits have been "too attractive," Hemsley said, adding the company would stop actively marketing the plans in major markets, and that it would address the problems by next year by redesigning the benefits. UnitedHealth also said it was seeing higher-than-expected use of mental health services because of the deteriorating economic environment, which also drove up costs. And its Ingenix business that administers clinical trials for drug makers saw three contracts canceled as the drug companies scaled back spending. The company said it was still closing its books on the second quarter, which ended June 30, but said it expects to post earnings per share, excluding items, for the period of 64 cents to 66 cents. Analysts on average had expected 80 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. The legal settlements, which are subject to court approval, brought the company closer to moving past a scandal over the manipulation of stock option dates that led to the departure of Hemsley's predecessor, William McGuire. UnitedHealth said it would pay $895 million to settle a federal securities class-action lawsuit involving the mammoth California Public Employees' Retirement System. The company also said it had agreed to resolve an Employee Retirement Income Security Act class-action litigation, also relating to stock options, for which it will pay $17 million. UnitedHealth said it would take a charge of 46 cents per share in the second quarter related to the settlements. In April, UnitedHealth posted a lower-than-expected first-quarter profit and slashed its full-year earnings forecast because of falling revenue growth and margins for its commercial plans for employers and Medicare plans for the elderly. UnitedHealth cut membership forecasts in both areas. The company is to report second-quarter results on July 22, when it also plans to provide a full report on its outlook. UnitedHealth shares rose 70 cents, or 2.7 percent, to $26.33 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
