 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Eastman Kodak Co EK.N and Matsushita Electric Industrial Co Ltd (MEI) ( 6752.T ) agreed to settle their patent infringement claims, Kodak said in a regulatory filing on Friday. 

 Kodak said no monetary consideration was paid under the agreement reached on December 21, according to the filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Kodak also said it reached a technology cross-license agreement with MEI, which will allow each company access to the other's patent portfolio. Kodak also settled its claims with Victor Co of Japan Ltd 6792.T, which was also a defendant in Kodak's suit against
MEI. (Reporting by  Karey Wutkowski ; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)
