 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc.( BRKa.N ) ( BRKb.N ) is starting a new bond insurer that would help state and local governments sell debt and that is likely to lure business from established rivals struggling with deteriorating credit markets. 

 State and local governments finance hospitals, roads, schools, sewer systems and sports facilities with municipal bonds. They often insure their bonds to reduce the perceived risk of owning their debt and thus cut debt service costs. State and local governments insured $196.7 billion out of a record $422.8 billion of bonds sold year-to-date, according to Thomson Financial. The share of insured bonds fell to 46.5 percent from 52.7 percent last year because of credit concerns surrounding existing insurers, such as MBIA ( MBI.N ) Insurance Corp and Ambac Financial Group ABK.N. Credit rating agencies are reviewing ratings of most established insurers, except for Dexia's( DEXI.BR ) Financial Security Assurance, on concern they will not be able to cover losses on bonds they guarantee. The following is the latest rankings of municipal bond insurers and volumes they guaranteed year to date, as compiled by Thomson Financial. Insurer Par amount Issues (in bln $) 1. FSA 48.2 1,681 2.
