 MELBOURNE  (Reuters) - Fortescue Metals Group ( FMG.AX ) founder Twiggy Forrest is seeking to buy 60 million shares or 1.9 percent in the iron-ore miner for about A$294 million ($294 million), dealers said adding the book build by Morgan Stanley is yet to be completed. 
 Morgan Stanley was bidding for 60 million shares at around A$4.90 a share on an all-or-nothing basis, meaning if the full order was not met, no shares would be bought. Fortescue shares closed on Monday at A$4.85. One dealer said a special trade for 1 million shares was put through at A$4.92 on Tuesday morning, but that was not part of the bundle Morgan Stanley was seeking. A spokeswoman for Fortescue declined comment as did a spokesman for Morgan Stanley. Separately Forrest, who owns 31.6 percent in Fortescue according to Thomson Reuters data, disclosed in a filing that he had picked up 12.78 million shares in the open market between June 20 and June 25. Fortescue, valued by the market at A$15.1 billion, fell 0.5 percent to $4.825 by 0102 GMT. The broader market was down 0.3 percent.
