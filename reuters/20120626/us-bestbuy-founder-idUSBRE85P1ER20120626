 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Best Buy Co Inc ( BBY.N ) founder Richard Schulze is working with Credit Suisse ( CSGN.VX ) to explore options for his 20.1 percent ownership stake in the company, including the possibility of a buyout, sources familiar with the situation said. 
 Schulze resigned from the retailer's board earlier this month and said he was exploring options for his ownership stake, a move that was seen as a possible precursor of a Schulze-led private takeover. A representative for Schulze was not immediately available for comment. Credit Suisse declined to comment. (Reporting By  Nadia Damouni ; Editing by  Gary Hill )
