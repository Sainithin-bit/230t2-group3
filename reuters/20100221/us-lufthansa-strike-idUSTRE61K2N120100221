 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Pilots at German flag carrier Lufthansa went on strike on Monday after last-ditch attempts to reach a compromise failed, the airline said. 

 Lufthansa said in a statement: "We hereby confirm that the strike, which was initiated by the Vereinigung Cockpit trade union, began at midnight" (6 p.m. EST on Sunday). The strike is due to run for four days. Monday was also the final day of a cabin crew strike ballot at Lufthansa's rival British Airways over similar action. Lufthansa's pilots voted for the strike on concerns that the company could try to cut staff costs by shifting jobs to foreign subsidiaries such as Austrian Airlines or Lufthansa Italia, where wages are lower. Over the weekend, the pilots' union offered new negotiations, but Lufthansa said it would not resume talks unless the union dropped demands for what it saw as undue influence on managerial decisions. Lufthansa board member Stefan Lauer told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung paper on Sunday that the company was prepared to guarantee all pilots' jobs until the end of 2012. It could extend that guarantee until 2013 or 2014 if pilots were willing to forego pay raises for more than 12 months, he said. Lufthansa has said the strike will cost it about 100 million euros ($135 million) in cash, in addition to lost ticket sales and possible damage to its reputation. Germany's economic recovery stalled at the end of 2009, and workers are becoming increasingly concerned that they could lose their jobs. They are looking to employers to promise job security in exchange for concessions on pay, as carmaker Volkswagen has. Engineering sector workers have also accepted moderate wage increases to help boost employment prospects. (Reporting by  Maria Sheahan , editing by Mark Trevelyan)
