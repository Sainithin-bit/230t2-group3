 BERLIN  (Reuters) - More "accidents" might occur in the global financial system but governments' actions have put Europe in a better position to cope with them, European Central Bank Executive Board member Juergen Stark said. 

 "We are in an environment of extremely high uncertainty. There is still a high risk that we will see one or the other accident," Stark told German radio station Deutschlandfunk on Tuesday. "Since the peak we saw around two weeks ago, practically all governments in Europe and the United States have taken wide-reaching measures, so that we are now in a better situation to deal with new surprises." Stark said conditions in the interbank lending market had improved over the past weeks but had not yet experienced a breakthrough. He said there was no reason to fear that the European Central Bank's frequent provisions of liquidity would endanger its role as the anchor for stability in the euro zone. Stark called for better risk management at banks and said one of the lessons of the global financial crisis was that salary schemes and bonus structures should be examined.
