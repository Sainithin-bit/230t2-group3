 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Google Inc ( GOOG.O ) has canceled plans for a search advertising partnership with Yahoo Inc ( YHOO.O ) amid opposition from antitrust regulators and advertisers, Google's chief legal officer said in a blog posting on Wednesday. 

 "After four months of review, including discussions of various possible changes to the agreement, it's clear that government regulators and some advertisers continue to have concerns about the agreement," the legal officer, David Drummond, said in the posting. "We're of course disappointed that this deal won't be moving ahead," he said. Google and Yahoo, Nos. 1 and 2 in the Internet search market, announced the planned partnership in June but delayed implementation to allow the U.S. Justice Department to scrutinize it for antitrust issues. Between them, Google and Yahoo had more than 80 percent of the web search market in August, according to comScore Inc. (Reporting by  Diane Bartz ; editing by John Wallace)
