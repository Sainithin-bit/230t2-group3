 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD.N ), one of the world's two makers of microprocessors for personal computers, said it cut 500 people effective on Wednesday. 

 "Today's announced headcount reduction is an unfortunate but necessary part of this process to help us align our people with the focused programs that achieve our objectives, eliminate duplication of efforts and allow us to operate more efficiently," the company said in a statement. A spokesman declined to give any detail about where the cuts had been made. (Reporting by  David Lawsky ; editing by Carol Bishopric)
