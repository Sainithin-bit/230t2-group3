 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Luxury department store Saks Inc SKS.N on Wednesday said it was discontinuing its unprofitable Club Libby Lu stores and firing the specialty chain's 1,700 employees. 

 Saks said it will take an after-tax, noncash charge of about $11 million in its third quarter and between $18 million and $27 million in its fourth quarter related to the closure. Saks said it expects to wrap up Club Libby Lu operations by May 2, 2009, and associates will be offered severance packages. Saks bought Club Libby Lu, which specializes in clothing for girls ages 4 to 12, in 2003 as a growth vehicle for its Saks Department Store Group business, which it has since sold. Saks said the Club Libby Lu made $60 million in revenue last year, but was not profitable. The retailer currently operates 98 Club Libby Lu locations. Saks, which also operates Saks Fifth Avenue and Off 5th, has been overhauling its businesses and renovating stores after shedding its mid-tier chains in 2005 and 2006. Saks' shares fell 11 cents, or 1.84 percent, to $5.88 in early New York Stock Exchange trading. (Reporting by  Sarah Coffey , editing by Maureen Bavdek)
