 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Molson Coors Brewing Co ( TAP.N ) reported higher quarterly profit on Wednesday that met Wall Street expectations, helped by market share gains in Canada and Britain, sending the brewer's stock up 5.4 percent. 

 The maker of Coors Light and Molson Canadian, which recently merged its U.S. operations into a joint venture with SABMiller Plc ( SAB.L ) to form MillerCoors, reported that third-quarter net income rose to $173.2 million, or 94 cents per share, from $134.7 million, or 74 cents per share, a year ago. Underlying profit, excluding items, was 95 cents per share, in line with analysts' average estimate, according to Reuters Estimates. Net sales fell 45 percent to $921.1 million, while sales by volume fell 58 percent to 4.6 million barrels. The company cited the transfer of all U.S. beer sales to the MillerCoorsjoint venture in which Molson has an equity stake. Including volume from the joint venture, total worldwide beer volume rose 0.2 percent to 12 million barrels. Sales to retailers, which more closely measure consumer demand, rose 0.7 percent in the United States for MillerCoors. Molson said sales to retailers were up 3.7 percent in Canada and fell 3.1 percent in Britain, outperforming the wider industry in both regions. The company said it was accelerating its three-year savings targets for the joint venture by six months versus its original targets. Molson, whose shares have tumbled 34 percent over the past five months, jumped $2.07 at $40.65 on the New York Stock Exchange.
