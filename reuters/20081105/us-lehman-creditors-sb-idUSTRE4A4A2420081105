 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEHMQ.PK on Wednesday held off requests by creditors seeking to regain access to more than $300 million worth of assets caught up in the collapse of the 158-year-old investment bank. 

 In a court hearing in Manhattan, Lehman's attorney Harvey Miller said Lehman was making progress in its work to wind down its business. "As each day has gone by, it's resulted in greater organization, and greater control," Miller told the court, having only weeks earlier described the "chaos" that resulted when Lehman filed for bankruptcy protection, and the thousands of transactions the company is working to sort out. At the hearing, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James Peck heard from lawyers for creditors Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp ( 8316.T ) of Japan and the DnB Bank Nord affiliate of DnB NOR DNBNOR.OL of Norway, but did not allow either group immediate access to the funds they say are held by Lehman. John Conlon, a lawyer for Sumitomo said the bank wanted access to collateral worth more than $300 million because the value of that collateral "has dropped precipitously over the last month." Judge Peck said he needed to hear further evidence about the valuation of the collateral, and said the Japanese bank appeared to be "on a mission" to gain immediate access to the funds. "I believe that the parties to transactions ,not just in this case, but in any case, are not held to an arbitrary time schedule," Peck said. Peck also heard from a lawyer for DnB Bank Nord, who was seeking access to a deposit of about $18.5 million. Miller said Lehman was in negotiations with the bank to try to resolve the matter and protect against deterioration in its value. If the matter could not be resolved by November 18, the court could hold a hearing on the matter on December 3, the lawyers said. At the hearing, Peck also granted Lehman approval to sell an airplane for $24.9 million, a figure that Miller told the court was slightly less than the plane's original value, given the current market conditions. The funds from the plane's sale could ultimately benefit Lehman creditors. The hearing is scheduled to resume later on Wednesday to discuss a request by solar panel maker Evergreen Solar Inc ESLR.O. Evergreen is seeking an injunction to prevent Barclays Plc ( BARC.L ) from trading shares it says were sold to Barclays in September as part of its deal to buy Lehman's core U.S. brokerage business.
