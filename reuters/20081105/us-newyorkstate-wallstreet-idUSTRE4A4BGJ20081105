 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wall Street bonuses could tumble 41.3 percent next year, which would even top the plunge that occurred one year after the World Trade Center was smashed, the state Assembly said on Wednesday. 

 "A decline of this magnitude is unprecedented, surpassing even the 24.1 percent falloff in the industry variable wages in 2002 after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001," the Assembly said in a new report. One out of every five tax dollars the state collects come from the financial industry, and the Democrat-led Assembly issued its new forecasts just a few days before the deadline set by the governor for devising ways to close the state's $47 billion multi-year deficit.
