 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Wednesday she will try to push an economic stimulus plan through Congress in a special post-election session. 

 Pelosi, a California Democrat, said she has been in discussions with the White House on legislation to boost the faltering economy and expressed hope that Senate Republicans would not try to block the plan following the Democratic sweep on Tuesday and Sen. Barack Obama's historic election as president. "The economy is the top item on the agenda as we go forward," Pelosi told a news conference. She said additional economic stimulus may be needed once Obama takes office in January. (Editing by  James Dalgleish )
