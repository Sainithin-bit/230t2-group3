 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Diversified manufacturer United Technologies Corp ( UTX.N ) stands by its 2008 profit forecast, though the strengthening dollar may put results near the low end of its forecast, a top executive said on Wednesday. 

 "We have obviously been impacted by the euro," said Greg Hayes, chief financial officer of the world's largest maker of elevators and air conditioners. "We may be toward the middle, even the low end of the range." The euro fell roughly 1.1 percent to $1.2891 on Wednesday. Early in the session, the euro zone common currency had climbed as high as $1.3031 according to Reuters charts, after stop-loss orders in the dollar were triggered in the lower $1.2900 region. When United Tech reported third-quarter results last month, it said it looked for full-year profit of $4.90 to $4.95 per share. Analysts, on average, look for $4.94 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. The Hartford, Connecticut-based company, which also makes Black Hawk military helicopters and engines for military aircraft, expects the U.S. defense budget to be under pressure in the coming years as a result of the economic crisis. "There is going to be some pressure on defense spending beyond 2009 ... as there is on every other bit of discretionary spending in the U.S. budget over the next several years," Hayes said.
