 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Macy's Inc ( M.N ) plans to hire 725 more people in the next two years to beef up its e-commerce sales, one of the department store operator's fastest growing segments. 

 Combined online sales at its namesake chain and its upscale Bloomingdale's chain rose 28.5 percent in the first three quarters of its current fiscal year. Over that period, online sales lifted Macy's companywide same-store sales, or sales at stores open at least a year, by 0.7 percentage points. Macy's said it would create 375 new jobs in New York for the macys.com and bloomingdales.com websites, 200 jobs in San Francisco for macys.com, and 150 jobs at a data center near Atlanta.
