 BEIJING  (Reuters) - Chinese provinces, from northeastern Heilongjiang to southwestern Yunnan, have set ambitious growth targets for this year and into the future, challenging the central government's goal of reshaping the economy along more sustainable lines. 

 Growth-obsessed local officials regularly chafe under -- and often flout -- Beijing's reform directives, but the latest flare-up of tension comes at a particularly sensitive time. The central government is trying to cut the economy's reliance on pollution-belching, energy-guzzling factories and to put the brakes on a housing construction boom that could turn into a destabilizing bubble. That desire for moderation is expected to be expressed in a target of 7 percent annual growth in the official five-year plan for 2011-15, well down from last year's pace of about 10 percent. But local cadres are not showing similar restraint. They are still chasing high-octane growth. According to published proposals, the provinces of Anhui, Fujian, Chongqing, Guizhou, Heilongjiang, Guangxi and Yunnan would like to double local gross domestic product (GDP) in the next five years, which would translate into an annual growth of about 15 percent. Inner Mongolia, which led all Chinese regions with annual average growth of 18.7 percent from 2002 to 2009, said it was aiming to "maintain faster growth in major economic indicators than the national average." CONFLICT "The biggest issue in China's economy may be the conflict between the central government and local ones," Long Guoqiang, a researcher with a think-tank under the State Council, told the China Economic Times on Tuesday. "Local governments never worry about economic imbalances or over-heating. Over-heating is not in their dictionary. 80 percent growth in GDP would still be okay for them," Long said. The central government often sets conservative targets, including just a 7.5 percent annual growth target in the 2006-10 five-year plan. The fact that real growth averaged 11 percent during that time is evidence of the ability of local governments to get around Beijing's orders. In a sign of the central government's frustration, the People's Daily, the official newspaper of the ruling Communist Party, published a commentary on Tuesday decrying the lack of cooperation from local governments in cooling the real estate market. "The truth is that many cities and developers are still hoarding property and hoarding land. Funding for affordable housing is not reaching its target and such developments are proceeding slowly," the newspaper wrote. "Apart from excess liquidity and high inflationary expectations, we can see that a big cause of the problem is that local governments are not carrying out their responsibilities." REBALANCING? In part, faster growth for places such as Guizhou and Guangxi, two of China's poorer provinces, fits into the government's objective of fuelling the rural interior to catch up with the long-booming coast. The problem is that some of the wealthier provinces of the world's second-largest economy are still setting their sights on big numbers. The eastern province of Jiangsu has proposed aiming for an annual average of 10 percent growth over the next five years. Hu Angang, a professor with Tsinghua University and an adviser to China's top leadership, said that the rate of growth, not the quality of growth, was still the biggest pursuit of many local Chinese officials, even though they pay lip service to slogans about 'green development'. "It is a typical practice of flashing your left-turn indicators but turning to the right," Hu wrote in the 21st Century Business Herald. "If it continues, China will fail to achieve its goal of changing its economic growth model," he added. Career prospects of local officials are determined by performance reviews that place much more emphasis on growth rather than the quality of public services they deliver. Many scholars, including Hu from Tsinghua, have proposed that China should change the assessment system to steer the economy in a healthier direction. (Editing by  Tomasz Janowski )
