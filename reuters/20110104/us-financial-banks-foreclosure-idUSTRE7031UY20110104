 BANGALORE  (Reuters) - The five largest mortgage loan servicers, including Bank of America Corp and JPMorgan Chase & Co, may be the first to settle with 50 state attorneys general who are investigating foreclosure practices, Bloomberg reported, citing Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller. 

 The attorney-general group expects to reach five separate agreements with the five largest servicers, the news agency said, quoting Miller, who heads the multi-state probe. Miller could not be immediately reached for comment by Reuters outside regular U.S. business hours. The other three large servicers are Citigroup Inc, Wells Fargo & Co and Ally Financial Inc. The group has had at least one face-to-face meeting with representatives from all five of the largest banks and will reach individual settlements rather than a global agreement with the servicers, Bloomberg reported. Mortgage servicers have come under fire in recent months for abuses of the foreclosure process. All 50 state AGs formed a joint probe in October to investigate the use of "robo-signers" in foreclosure proceedings. Ally Financial, Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo could not be immediately reached for comment by Reuters outside regular U.S. business hours.
