 BEIJING  (Reuters) - China's central bank chief Zhou Xiaochuan said the Chinese economy likely grew around 10 percent in 2010. 

 In a speech published on Tuesday on the central bank's website (www.pbc.gov.cn), Zhou said he was not confident that China's economy, the world's second largest, was on a "normal" growth trajectory because of tepid demand in the developed world. Zhou first delivered the speech on Dec 15. (Reporting by Langi Chiang and Koh Gui Qing; Editing by  Ben Blanchard )
