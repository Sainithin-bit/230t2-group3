 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - The European Union's executive will propose rules this week that could force those that lend to troubled banks to shoulder more of the cost of winding them up, a senior EU official said on Tuesday. 

 The proposal to pass the pain of a bank's failure on to bondholders is one of a series of measures designed to cope with lenders in difficulty. It could be law in Europe by 2012. Officials hope it will guard against a repeat of the global economic crisis, triggered by a wave of bank failures. But the idea, which mirrors German plans to force private holders of government debt securities to share the pain of a sovereign default, is likely to be contested. Berlin's push for a new regime for government bondholders from 2013 has rattled investors worried about the security of their investments, and threatened to make it more expensive to borrow as lenders factor in a bigger risk of default. "We need a sound legal basis for that to develop in Europe," said the official, outlining the European Commission's desire to break the status quo, where bank bondholders have typically enjoyed protection while shareholder investments crumble. One option, said the official, who declined to be named, would be to transform a bank bond into shares should the institution run into difficulty. "Banks can already issue convertible bonds," he said. "But that is very rare at the moment. We need a legal framework for that." Such a scheme could have dramatically altered the banking crisis that engulfed Ireland, and forced it to turn to its European neighbors and the International Monetary Fund for an 85-billion-euro ($114 billion) bailout. Bondholders in Ireland's biggest banks, such as Anglo Irish Bank ANGIB.UL, suffered only marginal losses, while shareholders were almost entirely wiped out, and the government was forced to step in to nationalize the nation's top lenders. INVESTORS ON EDGE German Chancellor Angela Merkel and officials in Brussels are now pushing to end this reluctance to sacrifice bondholders with new rules that would take the shine off their status. Berlin has repeatedly emphasized that there will be no sudden changes to bondholder rights under plans for so-called collective action clauses, and the EU official said on Tuesday that any changes would apply to bank bonds issued in the future. Nonetheless, suspicious investors remain on edge and borrowing costs are rising for heavily indebted countries. Last month, a senior German politician said Germany hoped to see private investors voluntarily join a scheme to restructure euro zone bonds in 2011. Fearing that shutting troubled banks or other financial firms might lead to a repeat of the turmoil that followed Lehman Brothers' failure, European countries pumped billions into the financial system as credit markets tightened. This sparked a debate about how to prevent a repeat of the situation where European countries had to commit the equivalent of almost a third of their output to protect the banking system. The European Commission, which writes the first draft of laws for the EU's 27 countries, will also propose a scheme to improve cooperation among national authorities in tackling stricken big banks. Officials want to prevent a repeat of the chaos that surrounded the failure of Fortis, when the Netherlands rushed to protect the bank's operations on its territory, leaving Belgium scrambling to prop up the rest of the group. Negotiations will start with the bloc's member countries and its parliament within months to thrash out a final version of the law. (Editing by Sharon Lindores)
