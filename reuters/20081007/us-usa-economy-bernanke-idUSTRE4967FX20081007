 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Tuesday signaled a readiness to lower U.S. interest rates in a dramatic shift to support an economy battered by a financial crisis of "historic dimension." 

 KEY POINTS: * Recent economic data and financial developments show that the outlook for growth has worsened and downside risks to growth have gained, Bernanke said in remarks to the National Association for Business Economics. * The outlook for inflation, while still uncertain, has improved somewhat as oil and other commodity prices have eased, he said. * "In light of these developments, the Federal Reserve will need to consider whether the current stance of policy remains appropriate," Bernanke said. COMMENTS: DAVID SLOAN, ECONOMIST, 4CAST LTD, NEW YORK: "He is giving quite a strong hint that a rate cut is in the cards, when he said they need to consider whether current stance on policy remains appropriate. He has certainly made it clear that things have changed, basically he is saying that the financial turmoil has added to the growth risks, and the inflation outlook has improved. He is not prepared to announce any complacency on inflation, but he is basically saying that things have changed -- the growth outlook is worse than it was and the inflation outlook is better than it was, and that causes a policy reassessment. It seems to suggest that a rate cut is likely." JOSEPH TREVISANI, CHIEF MARKET ANALYST, FX SOLUTIONS, SADDLE RIVER, NEW JERSEY: "I think the Fed has done a reasonably good job considering the unusual situation we are in. It pays to be flexible and the Fed has shown a great deal of flexibility in this. They're taking very practical steps. It's hard to tell what the Fed's next move will be (on rates). My guess is the Fed probably will cut rates, but I think they are waiting along with the rest of the central banks to see if they can make a coordinated move after the G7 meeting. My guess is you'll have a serious drop in inflation that even Trichet has acknowledged." KEVIN FLANAGAN, FIXED INCOME STRATEGIST FOR GLOBAL WEALTH MANAGEMENT, MORGAN STANLEY, PURCHASE, NEW YORK: "I don't think Bernanke is offering anything new. What he is doing is the wise thing: not to throw cold water on the notion that the Fed could be lowering interest rates. "From this (Bernanke's remarks) we lean in the direction that the Fed may lower rates at the (October) meeting." CHRISTIAN MENEGATTI, LEAD ANALYST, RGE MONITOR.COM, NEW YORK: "The Fed is recognizing the seriousness of this unprecedented crisis. It will act as needed to unfreeze the credit market as quickly as possible. This may include an emergency rate cut or even better a coordinated rate cut with other central banks. It may happen this week or next week, probably before its next policy meeting." "Some other extreme measure has to be taken. It could be a rate cut. The other one is an extended guarantee for all the deposits in the U.S. banking system. It's an extreme radical measure but these are extreme radical times. Deflation is more a problem than inflation for not just the U.S. and G7 but also emerging markets."
