 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve Board said on Tuesday that in approving Morgan Stanley's sale of a stake to Japan's Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group a day earlier it had concluded the deal would not transfer control of the Wall Street investment bank. 

 The Fed on Monday granted approval for Mitsubishi UFJ to acquire up to 24.9 percent of Morgan Stanley's voting shares. Last week, Mitsubishi UFJ, Japan's largest bank, agreed to buy a 21 percent stake in Morgan Stanley for $9 billion, giving the U.S. firm a much-needed capital injection. The two firms said earlier on Tuesday that the deal was on track to close promptly, easing market fears that sent Morgan Stanley shares down 25 percent to $17.65. "In light of the unusual and exigent circumstances affecting the financial markets, and all other facts and circumstances, the board has determined that emergency conditions exist to justify expeditious action on this proposal," the Fed said in a statement detailing its decision to approve the transaction. The Fed said that if it were to determine that Mitsubishi UFJ would control Morgan Stanley through the transaction, the Japanese bank would become the 14th largest depository institution in the United States, with $2.7 trillion in consolidated assets and deposits of $76.6 billion. But the Fed said it has concluded that Mitsubishi UFJ would not acquire control of Morgan Stanley or have the ability to exercise a controlling influence over Morgan or its subsidiary depository institutions. If the Japanese bank wanted to increase its stake above 24.9 percent, it would have to seek Fed approval. The Fed said it considered in part that Mitsubishi UFJ has "committed not to exercise or attempt to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of Morgan or any of its subsidiaries." It also said Mitsubishi UFJ has promised to limit its Morgan Stanley board seats to no more than one. The Fed said it has relied on similar commitments made by bank investors in previous cases where it has determined a transaction did not constitute a controlling interest.
