 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Tuesday that cheaper oil prices in recent months should help moderate inflation pressures but warned the situation could also reverse quickly. 

 In response to questions after addressing the National Association for Business Economics, he also said it appeared that inflation expectations were relatively well-anchored. "I think it's very important to keep in mind that there's an awful lot of uncertainty here. We've not done a good job of predicting commodity prices," the Fed chief said. "They came down pretty quickly and they could go back up." On balance, though, he added: "The outlook for inflation does look better, there's a lot of uncertainty though, I think we have to be careful not to declare victory too soon."
