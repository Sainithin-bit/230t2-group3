 LONDON  (Reuters) - Influential investor Bill Gross called on Tuesday for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates to 1 percent from the current 2 percent because of sharp falls in asset prices globally. 

 "We are experiencing asset deflation and the threat of headline inflation is long past," he said in a note. Gross is chief investment officer of U.S.-based Pacific Investment Management Co., or Pimco, and manager of the world's biggest bond fund. He said the Federal Reserve needed to come up with a systematic solution to the current crisis including acting as a clearing house to guarantee that institutional transactions clear, and buying commercial paper outright. Gross said investors should expect a lengthy recession but not a depression. "It is best to focus on the potential unfreezing of commercial paper and a globally coordinated policy rate cut," he said. "Own the front ends of Treasury/LIBOR yield curves. Agency mortgage-backed securities will also benefit from Treasury buybacks. Stay liquid, remain in high quality."
