 LONDON  (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and his finance minister, Alistair Darling, will hold talks on the financial crisis with the governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King, later on Tuesday, a spokesman said. 

 The meeting, scheduled for 1600 GMT, will also include the chairman of Britain's Financial Services Authority. Brown's spokesman dismissed suggestions it was a "crisis meeting," saying it was part of overall efforts to handle the crisis. "Based on intensive discussion in recent weeks, the purpose of this latest meeting is to consider further the government's proposals for both the on-going action we are taking to stabilize the financial system and our proposals for long-term reform," the spokesman said.
