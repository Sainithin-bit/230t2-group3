 LUXEMBOURG  (Reuters) - EU finance ministers, seeking a confidence-booster as the global financial crisis pounded tiny Iceland on Tuesday, agreed to increase the minimum level of bank deposit insurance across the 27 European Union countries. 

 They also pledged to recapitalize any vital bank if needed to avoid, as France put it, another Lehman Brothers, the Wall Street giant that filed for bankruptcy last month as the worst financial crisis since the 1930s intensified. The ministers agreed to raise the minimum deposit guarantee to 50,000 euros ($68,000), half of what some wanted but more than double the 20,000 euros that is the floor level now. They struck the deal as more trouble hit banks following weekend rescues in Germany and the Benelux countries. Shares in some of Britain's big banks were hit by reports of talks on government cash injections and a source in the British banking industry said more urgent talks would take place in coming days. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown scheduled an evening meeting with his finance minister, central bank chief and the country's financial regulators, though Brown's spokesman dismissed suggestions it was a "crisis meeting." Shares in Royal Bank of Scotland and HBOS plunged nearly 40 percent on the day. Iceland, which is not in the EU, took over its second largest bank, propped up a battered currency and said it was seeking a 4 billion euro ($5.44 billion) loan from Russia to help tackle a financial crisis threatening to overwhelm it. RECAPITALISATION PLEDGE Under pressure from fast-moving events, the EU ministers issued a statement which followed up on pledges by their leaders on Monday to do all it took to protect depositors and ensure the stability of the banking system. "We all commit to take all necessary measures to enhance the soundness and stability of our banking system and to protect the deposits of individual savers," the statement said. "To protect the depositors' interests and the stability of the system, we stress the appropriateness of an approach including, among other means, recapitalization of vulnerable, systemically relevant financial institutions," it said. French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde said: "We're not going to tolerate a Lehman Brothers scenario." "We will take measures including recapitalization and we're very specific in what we say," Lagarde said. "We'll talk about terms and conditions. We will set down recommendations from the ministers of finance (regarding) under what conditions recapitalization will take place." Some at least remained somewhat skeptical. "Everything is evolving so quickly, but a more co-ordinated response would be more welcome," Alan Brown, chief investment officer at British fund manager Schroders, told Reuters, saying the response remained more reactive than proactive. In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel said again there was no need for the creation of a pan-European rescue fund for banks, something London also opposes, and French Prime Minister Francois Fillon said Paris saw no reason to push such an idea. On the deposit insurance rise, Irish Finance Minister Brian Lenihan, in the dog-house with some European partners after Dublin unilaterally took radical steps a few days ago, said: "Clearly anything we can do to give greater confidence among depositors is very important." European governments are struggling to shelter banks and depositors from the financial crisis that snowballed from the United States and is now rattling confidence, pummeling stocks and paralyzing wholesale money markets in Europe. European shares whipsawed through the day on Tuesday after the plunges of Monday but finished more or less flat following Monday's plunge. "COUNT ON THE ECB" Central bankers are pumping emergency funding into interbank markets to keep a fear-riven financial system from seizing up. European Central Bank chief Jean-Claude Trichet, said that the crisis was striking the heart of the world financial system but he vowed on Monday to keep pumping money though the system as long as needed. Other central bankers joined him in attempts at reassurance. "We have no reason to think the stock markets will collapse. There is no reason for that to happen. The companies behind them are companies that are fundamentally solid," French central bank governor Christian Noyer said. Portugal's central bank head Vitor Constancio said the financial crisis would clearly take a toll on the economy but he did not expect generalized recession. The discussion of a collective increase in minimum levels of protection for savers follows a general political pledge by EU leaders on Monday that people should not fear for their savings. Showing how hard it is to agree a common line with ease in Europe, Czech Finance Minister Miroslav Kalousek was quoted by a newspaper as saying ahead of Tuesday's compromise that Europe's politicians were going mad on rises in deposit insurance. "Politicians in Europe are going crazy. We didn't live through 40 years of real socialism only to return to it on the soil of the European Union," he was quoted by daily Hospodarske Noviny as saying. IRISH IRE Germany and others are annoyed with the Irish for going it alone with state guarantees for all liabilities of six Irish banks, and doing so via legislation rather than the political commitment that is being made elsewhere so far. One worry is that the measure discriminates against non-Irish banks and skews EU principles that business must compete on a level playing field. What sets Ireland's plan apart is that its government not only guaranteed savers' deposits but also banks' wholesale liabilities, meaning an institution lending to an Irish bank on interbank money markets knows the borrower is state-protected.
