 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve took a darker view of the U.S. economy in September as financial strains and government bailouts intensified, prompting some officials to suggest lower interest rates may be necessary, minutes of the Fed's September 16 meeting showed on Tuesday. 

 Members of the central bank's Federal Open Market Committee generally saw holding rates steady as consistent with a widely held view in mid-September that economic growth would gradually begin to strengthen in 2009. But participants in the Fed's meeting, which left the benchmark federal funds rate unchanged at 2 percent, said rapidly unfolding financial strains had increased downside risks to the economic outlook. "Some members emphasized that if intensifying financial strains led to a significant worsening of the growth outlook, a policy response could be required; however, such a response was not called for at this meeting," the Fed said. The Fed minutes, however, were trumped on Tuesday by Fed chairman Ben Bernanke's remarks, in which he signaled a readiness to lower U.S. interest rates in a dramatic shift to supported by an economy battered by a financial crisis of "historic dimension". Developments in the financial sector have accelerated since the Fed's September 16 rate decision. Later that very day, Bernanke and Paulson met with congressional leaders to propose a massive bailout fund to buy distressed assets from financial institutions. The $700 billion plan was approved by Congress on Friday. Since the FOMC meeting, the Fed also has announced a series of new actions aimed at propping up a teetering banking sector and unclogging credit markets. "It looks like the Fed at the time was concerned about the financial strain but at the same time, they were concerned about inflation risks," said Jon Basile, economist at Credit Suisse in New York. "Bernanke's speech overshadowed the FOMC minutes. It gives you an evolutionary of the Fed's view." "We are expecting the Fed to cut 50 basis points at the next meeting, but it all depends on the market," he said. The meeting minutes showed that before the recent freeze-up of credit markets, Fed officials were worried about a downward credit and growth spiral. "The fall in employment in August highlighted concerns that an adverse dynamic was taking hold, in which economic weakness increased financial firms' losses, leading to tighter credit conditions and thus causing a further softening of economic activity," the Fed said in the minutes. The minutes also showed an easing inflation picture, due to lower prices for oil and other commodities fell, a stronger dollar and "increased economic slack". However, Fed officials expressed concerns that businesses would resist reversing previous price increases and inflation may not moderate as anticipated.
