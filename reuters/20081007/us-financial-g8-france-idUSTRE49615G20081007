 TOKYO  (Reuters) - France has made a formal proposal to Japan and other Group of Eight (G8) countries to hold an emergency G8 summit meeting to deal with the financial crisis, Japan's Nikkei business daily reported on Tuesday. 

 The report, which did not cite sources, said Japan, currently the chair of the G8, will discuss the proposal with other members. French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who has repeatedly attacked the excesses of unregulated markets, has been pressing for a summit of world leaders to overhaul the global financial system before the year-end.
