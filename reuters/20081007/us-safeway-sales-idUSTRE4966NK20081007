 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Supermarket operator Safeway Inc ( SWY.N ) has seen sales and traffic trends improve for the first five weeks of its current fiscal fourth quarter, Chief Executive Steve Burd said on Tuesday. 

 In a conference call with analysts, Burd said traffic and sales are up at its stores, which include the Safeway, Vons and Dominick's chains. He also said identical-store sales, a measure of health for supermarkets, have "bottomed out." Safeway posted higher third-quarter profit on Tuesday as cost cuts helped offset lower spending by consumers, who have been battered by falling home prices, rising unemployment and more expensive necessities such as food and fuel.
