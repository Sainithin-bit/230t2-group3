 PARIS  (Reuters) - France hopes a Greek rescue plan can be agreed this week and believes that the private sector should participate in efforts to resolve the euro zone's debt crisis, government spokeswoman Valerie Pecresse said on Monday. 

 Pecresse, who is also budget minister, said in an interview on LCI television: "We want to wrap up the second Greek bailout plan. The only outstanding issue is the participation of the private sector -- a participation that is normal and fair (to expect) as everybody has to make an effort." France was in favor or private sector participation," she said. "The issue now is trying to make this happen without hurting the stability of the euro zone," she said. Asked if she believed a meeting of European leaders called for Thursday would come up with a concrete plan to tackle the region's debt woes, Pecresse noted that German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she backed such a summit if the leaders would be in a position to clinch a deal. "We hope a plan will be adopted. Angela Merkel's declaration yesterday that she hoped the euro group summit could be concrete and produce a decision goes very much in the right direction," said Pecresse, who added that France itself was sticking rigidly to its deficit reduction plan as previously announced.
