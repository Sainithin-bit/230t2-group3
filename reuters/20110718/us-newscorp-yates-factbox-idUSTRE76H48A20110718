 LONDON  (Reuters) - John Yates became the second senior London police officer to resign from his post in less than 24 hours over the News of the World phone hacking scandal Monday. 

 Yates was an Assistant Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police and the London force's top counter terrorism officer, based at police headquarters in Scotland Yard. He has been nicknamed "Yates of the Yard" by the British media following his involvement in numerous high-profile police investigations. Here are key facts about him: * Yates decided not to re-open an investigation into phone hacking at the News of the World in 2009 after considering the evidence for just eight hours. He was ordered to head the review into the original phone hacking investigation that started in 2005 by Paul Stephenson, former Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Service, who resigned Sunday. Yates described his own decision not to re-open the case as a "pretty crap one" in an interview with the Sunday Telegraph, and said in front of a parliamentary select committee earlier this month that he had probably done only the minimum amount of work before making his decision not to pursue allegations of phone hacking further. * Yates was responsible for carrying out "due diligence" in September 2009 before the Metropolitan Police awarded a contract to Neil Wallis' public relations firm, the BBC reported on Monday. Wallis, former deputy editor of the News of the World, was arrested earlier this month on suspicion of conspiring to intercept communications and Stephenson resigned three days later because of his links to Wallis. * Yates led the 16-month investigation into the "cash for honors" scandal that blighted former prime minister Tony Blair's final months in office. He and his team of officers launched the inquiry into political parties accepting cash in return for nominating people for seats in the House of Lords in 2006. Although Blair was questioned by officers three times and two of his former aides, a donor, and a Labor fundraiser were arrested, no one was ever charged during the investigation. * Yates also led the Metropolitan Police response to the Stockwell shooting, when police officers mistakenly shot Brazilian electrician Jean Charles de Menezes seven times in the head in July 2005, believing him to be one of four men who attempted to set off bombs in London the day before. * Yates has served as a senior detective in north and west London and was staff officer to Sir Paul Condon, now Lord Condon, during the inquiry into the racist murder of London teen-ager Stephen Lawrence, who was stabbed to death in 1993. He was awarded the Queen's Police Medal for distinguished services to policing in 2006. * Yates was born in Liverpool in 1959 and attended the prestigious public school Marlborough College and King's College, University of London.
