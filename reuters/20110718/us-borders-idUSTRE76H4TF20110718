 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - An auction in bankruptcy court for Borders Group Inc BGPIQ.PK is scheduled to take place in Manhattan on Tuesday. A group of liquidators has been made the "stalking horse," and sources told Reuters no other bids have been made for the company in its entirety. 

 Borders, once the second-largest U.S. book-seller chain, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in February and faces the specter of going out of business altogether. Here are some key dates in Borders' history: 1971: Tom and Louis Borders found Borders Book Shop in Ann Arbor, Michigan. 1992: Kmart buys Borders, then a Michigan-based chain of 21 book superstores in the Midwest and Northeast. In 1984, KMart buys Waldenbooks. 1995: Kmart spins off Borders-Walden Group in an IPO and changes its name to Borders Group. 1997: Borders announces plans for an international superstore chain that would have 1,000 locations. At that point, it had 203 stores. 1998: Launches Borders Online. 2000: Hires Merrill Lynch & Co to review options, including a recapitalization, leveraged buyout or combination with another company. 2001: Announces a deal with Amazon.com Inc ( AMZN.O ) to relaunch Borders' money-losing e-commerce site and feature Amazon.com's books and music offerings. 2006: Bill Ackman's Pershing Square takes 11 percent stake in Borders, saying the shares are undervalued and could rise to $36 from $23.92. Ackman says fears about competition from online retailer Amazon.com are exaggerated. 2008: March: Says it might put itself up for sale, but never finds a buyer. It gets $42.5 million loan from Ackman's firm and says it would have faced imminent liquidity problems without it. May - Larger rival Barnes & Noble Inc ( BKS.N ) puts together a team to look at a merger with Borders. Separately, Borders launches its own Web site. 2009: Says it expects only 50-60 of its Waldenbooks stores to survive in the long term. It had 564 in 2006. 2010: March 31: Repays $42.5 million loan to Pershing Square, gets more credit and posts a profit on cost-cutting. Shares jump. July 7: Launches e-book store, eight months after Barnes & Noble does. December 6: Ackman offers to finance a merger with Barnes & Noble. 2011 January 27: Says it gets conditional refinancing commitment from GE Capital and hints at a possible Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. January 30: Says it has been delaying payments to publishers and landlords. February 16: Files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in Manhattan. April: Conducts going-out-of-business sales for more than 200 stores. June: Chooses Najafi Cos to be "stalking horse" bidder, a deal which later unravels. A group of liquidators becomes the stalking horse. July 17: Deadline to submit bids in bankruptcy auction passes with no other offers besides "stalking horse" bid, according to sources. July 19: Scheduled date for bankruptcy auction in Manhattan. (Reporting by  Phil Wahba )
