 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - EU regulators will decide in the autumn whether to keep existing rules that specify how governments can aid troubled banks or adopt more stringent guidelines, the EU's antitrust chief said on Monday. 

 The current guidelines were issued by the European Commission in late 2008 allowing EU governments to bail out lenders in return for the lenders selling off assets and sharing the burden adequately with shareholders and some bondholders. Earlier this year, the European Union executive said it planned to tighten the rules in January 2012 to wean the financial sector off state support. The 2012 deadline may change following last week's stress tests which showed that some banks may need to raise additional capital, EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said. "During the autumn we will check, we will analyze how the market conditions evolve and we will decide in due course if the present exceptional regime will continue for everybody as it is the case today with the adapt ions we introduced 1st of January this year," Almunia told a news conference. "Or if given the improvements in the market situation, we can only focus on the countries under financing programs with the present exceptional regime and for all the others, we introduce the new regime," he said. Almunia said the Commission was prepared to introduce the new regime for rescue and restructuring of financial institutions from January next year but there was no final decision yet. "But I don't know today if we will decide that this is to continue, we will see how the market situation evolves," he said, adding aided banks would need to submit a restructuring plan to regulators.
