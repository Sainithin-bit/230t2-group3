 (Reuters) - Here are the main events in the phone-hacking scandal leading to News Corp's Chairman Rupert Murdoch withdrawing his bid for British broadcaster BSkyB and closing the 168-year-old News of the World tabloid. 

 2000 - Rebekah Wade is appointed editor of Britain's best-selling Sunday tabloid, News of the World. Aged 32 and the youngest national newspaper editor in the country, she begins a campaign to name and shame suspected pedophiles, leading to some alleged offenders being terrorized by angry mobs. She also campaigns for public access to the Sex Offenders' Register, which eventually comes into law as "Sarah's Law." 2003 - Wade becomes editor of tabloid the Sun, sister paper to the News of the World and Britain's biggest selling daily.

News International later says this is not company practice. November 2005 - The News of the World publishes a story on a knee injury suffered by Prince William. Royal court officials complain about voicemail messages being intercepted. The complaints spark a police inquiry. January 2007 - News of the World royal affairs editor Clive Goodman and private investigator Glenn Mulcaire admit conspiring to intercept communications, Mulcaire also pleads guilty to five other charges of intercepting voicemail messages. Goodman is jailed for four months, Mulcaire for six months. -- News of the World editor Coulson resigns, saying he took "ultimate responsibility" but knew nothing of the offences in advance. May 2007 - Coulson becomes Conservative Party director of communications under party leader David Cameron. June 2009 - Rebekah Wade becomes CEO of News International, grouping Murdoch's newspapers in Britain. She marries for a second time, becoming Rebekah Brooks. July 2009 - The Guardian newspaper says News of the World reporters, with the knowledge of senior staff, illegally accessed messages from the mobile phones of celebrities and politicians while Coulson was editor from 2003 to 2007. September 2009 - Les Hinton, chief executive of Dow Jones and former executive chairman of News International, tells a committee of legislators any problem with phone hacking was limited to the one case. He says they carried out a wide review and found no new evidence. February 2010 - The House of Commons Culture, Media and Sports Committee says in a report that it is "inconceivable" managers did not know about the practice, and says it was more widespread than the paper had admitted. September 2010 - Legislators ask parliament's standards watchdog to begin a new investigation into the hacking allegations at News of the World and its former editor Coulson. January 2011 - British police open a new investigation into allegations of phone hacking at the tabloid.

April 2011 - News of the World chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and Edmondson are arrested on suspicion of conspiring to intercept mobile phone messages. They are released on bail.

July 4 - A lawyer for the family of schoolgirl Milly Dowler, murdered in 2002, says he learned from police that her voicemail messages had been hacked, possibly by a News of the World investigator, while police were searching for her. Some messages may also have been deleted to make room for more, misleading her family into thinking she was still alive. Police later say they have also contacted the parents of two 10-year-old girls killed in the town of Soham in 2002. July 5 - News International says new information has been given to police. The BBC says it related to e-mails appearing to show payments were made to police for information and were authorized by Coulson. -- The list of those possibly targeted includes victims of the London suicide bombings of July 7, 2005, and the parents of Madeleine McCann, who disappeared in Portugal in 2007.

He is bailed until October. -- The News of the World's former royal editor, Goodman, is re-arrested in connection with a police operation looking at alleged payments to police by journalists at the paper. -- Police search the offices of the Daily Star tabloid where Goodman freelanced.

July 11 - Murdoch withdraws News Corp's offer to spin off BSkyB's Sky News channel, previously made to help win approval of its bid for the 61 percent of BSkyB it does not own.
