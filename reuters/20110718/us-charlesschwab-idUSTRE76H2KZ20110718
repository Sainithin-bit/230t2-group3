 TORONTO  (Reuters) - Charles Schwab Corp ( SCHW.N ) said second-quarter earnings rose 16 percent as asset management fees and interest revenue offset a slowdown in client trading. 

 Trading at Schwab has been pressured by soft markets, but executives at the big U.S. brokerage said clients are drawing down their low-yielding cash piles and reinvesting in the firm's offerings of mutual funds, ETFs and other products. "Kind of a good result on somewhat mediocre quality," said Macquarie Capital analyst Ed Ditmire. He said expenses and costs were slightly lower than he expected. Net income was $238 million, or 20 cents a share, a penny above the average forecast of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Schwab earned $205 million, or 17 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue at the San Francisco-based company rose 10 percent to $1.19 billion, meeting the average Wall Street forecast. Ditmire called the results bitter-sweet, given the environment of falling markets and consumer and investor sentiment that has carried into the current quarter. "But I think most of that has been priced into the stock after a pretty substantial year-to-date decline," he said. Schwab shares are down more than 15 percent this year and were off 3 percent to $14.55 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange amid a broad market decline. SCHWAB AS PROXY Schwab, a pioneer of discount and online brokerage, is widely viewed as a proxy for the profitability of retail brokerage across Wall Street. Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ), the biggest broker-dealer with more than 17,000 financial advisers, reports its quarterly results on Thursday. Schwab said second-quarter daily average trades -- a widely watched measure of client activity -- were down 9 percent from a year earlier and down 16 percent from the first quarter this year, to 397,100. Investors also were sidelined during the quarter by natural disasters such as the earthquake and tsunami in Japan as well as sovereign debt problems in Europe, a sputtering U.S. economic recovery and a budget stalemate in Washington. Howard Chen, an analyst at Credit Suisse, said he anticipates a further pullback of 7 percent to 10 percent in retail trading during the current quarter, but added that he sees upside potential in Schwab's stock. "While market and macro factors -- most notably the adverse impact of near-zero short-term interest rates -- continue to obscure the earnings power of the franchise, we continue to like the Schwab asset-gathering story," he said in a note to clients. HIGHER-YIELDING ADVISED ASSETS UP Client assets enrolled in Schwab's retail advisory offerings rose 20 percent in the second quarter to $113 billion. Total advised assets gained 17 percent to $811 billion. "That's a different measure of client activity and engagement," Joe Martinetto, chief financial officer at Schwab, said in an interview. He said Schwab is not as reliant on trading revenue as it once was, and that things like asset management fees and net interest revenue were able to more than offset the slowdown in trading activity. Ditmire said anything that mixes more of the client assets and activity into Schwab's higher-value-added services brings positive implications to the firm's business model. "Getting away from the competitive battle for getting trading commissions is always a positive," he said. Schwab had net new assets of $15.4 billion in the quarter, up 10 percent from a year earlier, adjusted for a large clearing outflow. Alois Pirker, research director at Aite Group, said that having more than $15 billion in new assets -- a key source of future revenue -- was "probably the envy of Wall Street." "I'm always looking at net new money because that is future revenue, he said. "They can digest that trading slowdown quite easily and live with the net new money and the new accounts." Schwab's competitors include TD Ameritrade ( AMTD.O ) and E*Trade Financial Corp ( ETFC.O ); both are due to report quarterly results later this week.
