 BEIJING  (Reuters) - Italy's foreign minister defended Italian banks on Monday by calling a recent sell-off in their shares "baseless," and stressed his country is unlike other ailing euro zone economies that had to be bailed out. 

 Franco Frattini, who was in China to foster ties between Beijing and Rome, said the swift passing of an austerity package by Italy's parliament last week showed the will of its politicians in tackling the nation's economic problems. Investors have worried that Italy, the euro zone's third-largest economy, could be the next country to get embroiled in the euro zone crisis due to a public debt burden of around 120 percent of GDP. A sell-off of its bond and stocks deepened again on Monday in response. "In the last few days our banks were attacked and you can say that was entirely baseless," Frattini said, speaking through a translator. "The situation in Italy, compared to those of other euro zone countries that were bailed out, is completely different." To calm a violent sell-off of Italian assets in the past week, Italy's parliament on Friday gave definitive approval to a 48 billion euro austerity package aimed at averting a full-scale financial crisis. Frattini said he was confident those measures would appease financial markets, adding that some Chinese investment funds have raised concerns about Italy's banking system. He said while he would make use of his visit to China to boost bilateral investment between his country and the world's second-largest economy, such talks are not driven by a need to shield Italian assets from attacks by financial markets. Italy's public debt mountain is among the highest in the world as a percentage of annual national output. Investor jitters over whether Rome can service and reduce it in the longer-term pushed Italian bond yields to their highest in over a decade last week. Given the size of the Italian economy, Europe's debt woes would escalate sharply if Italy was sucked deeper into the crisis, potentially overwhelming the euro area and breaking up the single currency.
