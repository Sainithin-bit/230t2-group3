 BERLIN  (Reuters) - Euro zone governments are considering a banking levy as a way to involve private creditors in a Greek rescue, Germany's Die Welt newspaper reported on Monday, citing diplomatic sources. 

 "A few days before a crisis summit in Brussels the governments of the 17 euro countries are considering involving the private sector via a new banking levy in a future rescue of highly-indebted Greece," the newspaper reported according to a news release ahead of publication. "The banking levy shall also be valid for financial institutions in euro zone countries that are not directly engaged in Greece, writes 'Die Welt', citing high diplomatic sources familiar with the negotiations," the report said. It gave no further details but added that this banking levy should come alongside a bond-buyback. Germany already plans a bank levy from the end of September, which will bring in around 1 billion euros a year. Also according to Die Welt, the International Monetary Fund is angered with Europe's crisis management and "influential parties" in the fund wished not to take part in further Greek rescue programmes, the newspaper said without giving further details.
