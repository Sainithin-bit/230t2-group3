 LONDON  (Reuters) - so much for the summer lull. We now have a Thursday euro zone summit to aim at with the presumption being that at least the outline of a Greek rescue package must be agreed beforehand (Merkel has said she will only turn up on that basis). 

 The summit is already front-and-center in markets' thinking, although the prospect of a U.S. default looms even more threateningly. Obama has set a Friday deadline for agreement on a deal to raise the country's debt ceiling so we could be approaching a perfect storm of events. What we think we know: The French plan is dead and euro zone governments seem to have given up on squaring the ratings agencies and are therefore prepared to accept a limited default as the price for a bond swap or buyback program, roping in private creditors. The ECB remains completely opposed to default and Trichet reiterated over the weekend that it would reject defaulted bonds as collateral and that it would be down to governments to keep Greek banks etc. funded. So that needs sorting out too. Do Trichet's carefully chosen words laying the gauntlet down to EZ governments allow for the use of the Emergency Liquidity Assistance facility that national central banks can use to provide commercial lenders with liquidity, something Ireland has availed itself of? Not for the first time Bini Smaghi broke ranks and said the EFSF bailout fund should be given money to buy back bonds from the market, which are already trading at around half value in many cases. The banks have been talking endlessly, most recently in Rome, and appear to be behind some form of haircut. The Institute of International Finance, which is chairing those talks, said progress had been made but gave no detail. Die Welt reported that a bank levy may also be making its way onto the table to fund a new Greek bailout, alongside a bond buyback. It would target banks regardless of their exposure to Greece which would seem a very blunt instrument and one that would do little to stabilize the sector. Is that really a runner? Friday's stress tests don't seem to have changed much, bar an incremental increase in confidence about the banking system (only eight tiddlers failed and need a tiny 2.5 billion euros to sort themselves out, the core capital pass mark was low and a Greek default was not tested for). The 16 nearly-faileds may come under pressure today but none of them are what you could call systemically important either and, interestingly, the big Spanish and Italian banks came out of the check in glowing health. Having said that, Portugal's biggest bank nearly failed as did Spain's Bankia and Italy's Banco Popolare, so there are some medium-sized fish in the net. In sum, the tests showed Europe's banks held nearly 100 billion euros of Greek sovereign debt at the end of last year, 2/3s of it held by Greek banks, 9 percent by Germans and 8 percent by French. That doesn't include the non-sovereign Greek debt that would almost certainly move into default too if the sovereign did (which French banks are stuffed with), so it's very far from being the whole picture so the threat of a new credit crunch has not evaporated.
