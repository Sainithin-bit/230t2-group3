 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Forest Laboratories Inc ( FRX.N ) said on Monday it plans to nominate a 10-person board slate that includes three new members at its shareholder meeting, as the drugmaker fends off a challenge from billionaire investor Carl Icahn. 

 In addition to seven incumbents, Forest plans to nominate Christopher Coughlin, former chief financial officer of Tyco International Ltd ( TYC.N ); Gerald Lieberman, former president of AllianceBernstein Holding LP ( AB.N ); and Brenton Saunders, chief executive officer of eye-care company Bausch & Lomb. Previously, Forest's board has had nine members. William Candee, a board member since 1959, and George Cohan, a director since 1977, will not stand for reelection at the meeting, which will be held August 18. The U.S. drugmaker, with a market value of about $11 billion, also urged shareholders to reject the four nominees from Icahn, who has built a roughly 7 percent stake in the company to make him its fourth-largest shareholder. In a letter to shareholders, Forest said Icahn's nominees are "far less qualified than our slate" and said two of Icahn's nominees were "hopelessly conflicted" because they serve on boards of biotech companies that have potentially competing products. According to Forest's proxy filing, Forest approached Icahn on July 12 about a possible settlement to avoid a proxy fight. The company said it told Icahn it would be adding several new nominees and might be willing to offer him "input" with regard to one of them. Icahn rejected the proposal, according to the proxy. Icahn did not immediately return a request for a comment. He previously told Reuters, in response to the possibility that he might only gain one seat on the board, that his group deserved more presence given his track record in boosting value at other biopharmaceutical companies, such as ImClone, Genzyme and Biogen-Idec Inc ( BIIB.O ), and that he believed shareholders would support him. Forest shares were off 2.4 percent to $37.55 in Monday afternoon trading, a compared with a roughly 1 percent drop for the Standard & Poor's 500 index  .SPX . Irina Rivkind, an analyst with investment bank Duncan-Williams, said the stock was down because some shareholders might be hoping for Icahn's involvement and are concerned that following Monday's announcement it could be more difficult to elect his board picks than expected. Forest CEO and Chairman Howard Solomon, who has led the company for 34 years, had been expected to hear calls from shareholders for some fresh perspective on the board in the wake of Icahn's challenge. "Shareholders have been waiting for a shake-up for some time," Rivkind said. Forest's new nominees, if elected, "may not represent a sufficiently bold shift in strategy or direction to assuage shareholders. I do think it is a step in the right direction, however." Solomon has become more vulnerable to attack as Forest struggles to address future revenue holes from top drugs going off patent and as the U.S. government threatens sanctions against him personally. U.S. regulators are weighing whether to bar Solomon from participating in federal healthcare programs after his company last year agreed to plead guilty and pay more than $313 million to resolve charges over improper marketing of several drugs. Icahn criticized the board for spending money to back Solomon against the government and sued to get access to details of the case. Company shares are worth about half of what they were at their height in 2004 and a third less than peak 2007 levels, though they had begun to rebound before Icahn made his move. To replace revenue declines when its top-selling Lexapro antidepressant loses patent protection early next year, Forest has been licensing or buying rights to products in late-stage development -- its long-held strategy under Solomon. In its letter to shareholders, Forest said it will have nine products launching between 2008 and 2013 and six more now in Phase II/III development expected to reach the market after 2014.
