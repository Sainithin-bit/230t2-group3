 BERLIN  (Reuters) - Germany is recruiting skilled workers from heavily indebted euro zone countries to help stave off its own shortage of skilled labor, the federal employment agency said on Monday. 

 With its fast-growing economy and low unemployment, Germany has a shortage of some 36,000 engineers and more than 5,000 hospital doctors, according to industry groups. The agency's foreign and professional jobs department is specifically targeting engineers from Spain and doctors from Greece, spokeswoman Beate Raabe said. "We are seeing a high level of interest in Spain," Raabe said. "Unemployment is high there and we're exploring the possibility of some seeking work in Germany." Spain currently struggles with the highest unemployment rate in the European Union, with more than one in five out of work. In Greece, the agency is zeroing in on would-be doctors who would have to train for years longer to practice in their homeland than in Germany, Raabe said. The German government last month relaxed conditions for skilled workers that were seen as hurting immigration as the country suffers from an aging population and low birth rates. Still, immigration laws are not the only hurdles to attracting skilled labor. Many find the German language difficult to learn and find few language courses in their home country, the agency said. "Germany is no longer a first foreign language learned," Raabe said, adding most skilled workers learn English and as a result seek jobs in the Anglophone countries.
