 LONDON  (Reuters) - News Corp said on Monday it had set up an independent committee chaired by Lord Grabiner QC to oversee new compliance, ethics and governance procedures at its British newspaper arm at the center of a phone hacking scandal. 

 The Management and Standards Committee will act as an independent body outside of the News International group and report directly to News Corp board director Joel Klein and Viet Dinh. "We are very pleased that such an eminent person as Lord Grabiner has agreed to be the independent Chairman," Klein said in a statement. "His appointment clearly demonstrates that we are serious about putting things right that have gone wrong in the past." (Reporting by  Paul Sandle )
