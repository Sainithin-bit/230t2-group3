 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Following is the text of a statement by Andrew D. Busch in support of Anheuser-Busch Cos Inc ( BUD.N ) as it considers a takeover bid from Belgian-Brazilian brewer InBev NV INTB.BR: 

 As a non-employee member of the Busch family I support Anheuser-Busch in efforts to remain a strong company headquartered in St. Louis, where it was born and has prospered for more than 130 years. I support my nephew August Busch IV (President and CEO), the board of directors and the management team of Anheuser-Busch Cos Inc as they evaluate and respond to the InBev proposal. I believe that Anheuser-Busch has created substantial shareholder value over the long term and that it will continue to maintain the best interests of the shareholders and employees. I am not a company employee, and I have no role in the company's decisions about the InBev proposal, other than the role each shareholder may have as this matter moves forward. As a non-employee family member, I do not speak for the company or other family members. I am proud to be a member of the company's founding family and of its role in building the King of Beers and the iconic beer company based in St. Louis.
