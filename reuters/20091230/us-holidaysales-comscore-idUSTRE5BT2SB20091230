 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - U.S. online spending rose 5 percent to $27.12 billion from the start of November through Christmas Eve even though individuals spent slightly less than they did last year, according to data released by comScore on Wednesday. 

 Adjusting for the impact of an additional shopping day between Thanksgiving and Christmas versus 2008, sales rose only about 3.5 percent, the analytics firm said. Sales of consumer electronics jumped slightly more than 20 percent and jewelry and watches were also strong performers after a "very weak" season a year earlier, comScore Chairman Gian Fulgoni said in a statement. In 2008, online sales as tracked by comScore fell 3 percent. (Reporting by  Jessica Wohl , editing by Matthew Lewis)
