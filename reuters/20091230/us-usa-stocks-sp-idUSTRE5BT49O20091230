 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The benchmark S&P 500 on Wednesday was on track to close out its first annual advance in two years, underpinned by strength in the technology and materials sectors on hopes that the economic recovery will spur a rebound in capital spending and fuel demand for natural resources. 

 The S&P 500 showed a year-to-date gain of 24.7 percent at the close of trading on Wednesday. It ended down 38.5 percent in 2008. The run-up in sectors like technology underscores the extent of the damage done to financial stocks in the financial crisis of 2008. Financials were once the largest sector in the S&P, but tech is now the largest. The top 10 S&P 500 stock performers of 2009 do not include a major U.S. bank. Citigroup Inc's stock is on track to close the year among the S&P 500's top 10 laggards. But Ford Motor Co should finish among the standouts as the automaker continues to steer itself through the turmoil that sent rivals Chrysler and General Motors into bankruptcy.
