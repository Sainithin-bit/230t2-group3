 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - American International Group Inc's Anastasia Kelly will get about $2.8 million as she leaves the giant insurer, according to a source familiar with the matter. 

 AIG on Wednesday announced that Kelly planned to leave the company after her pay was cut because of pay curbs imposed by the Obama Administration's pay czar. (Reporting by  Steve Eder )
