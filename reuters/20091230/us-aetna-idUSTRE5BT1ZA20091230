 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Health insurer Aetna Inc ( AET.N ) said on Wednesday it expects to take a charge of $60 million to $65 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 to cover costs associated with job cuts and real estate consolidation. 

 The company expects to take an after-tax charge of $40 million associated with its previously announced plan to cut 625 jobs, as well as consolidation of real estate. A similarly sized workforce reduction to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2010 is expected to result in a charge of about $20 million to $25 million, after tax, the Hartford, Connecticut-based company said. Aetna said the job cuts are based on the company's membership outlook for 2010 and made in preparation for the impact that health care reform and regulatory changes may have on the company's business. After the job cuts are completed, Aetna will have about 34,300 employees. (Reporting by  Toni Clarke ; Editing by  Derek Caney )
