 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Technology outsourcing and consulting firm Accenture Ltd ( ACN.N ) reported a drop in quarterly sales and lowered its full-year profit outlook due to a stronger dollar and a slower global economy, dragging its shares down 10 percent. 

 Accenture Chief Executive William Green said business changed dramatically between December and January as customers held back from buying as they grappled with questions about liquidity, credit, and payroll. "People came back to work after the holiday in January and things just slowed down," he told analysts on a conference call. "If you look at what happened from mid-December through the beginning of January as it relates to the economy, it was very profound." Accenture said revenue for its fiscal second quarter ended February 28 fell 6 percent from a year ago to $5.27 billion, hurt in part by a stronger dollar. That was lower than the $5.54 billion average analyst estimate, according to Reuters Estimates. The company forecast third-quarter revenue of $5.1 billion to $5.3 billion, compared with average Wall Street expectations of $5.8 billion. Accenture's shares have only fallen around 10 percent over the past 12 months, outperforming many technology stocks, on hopes that its global outsourcing business would help the firm weather the U.S. economic slowdown. "Even a bellwether can succumb to pressure, and Accenture is showing that it is not immune to the challenging economic environment," said Eugene Zakharov, an analyst at research firm Technology Business Research. Accenture said it now expects earnings per share for the current fiscal year of $2.60 to $2.67, down from its previous forecast of $2.78 to $2.85 cents according to Reuters Estimates. Quarterly profit was $411.4 million, or 63 cents a share, compared with $406.6 million, or 64 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Fewer shares outstanding helped to cushion the decline in per-share profit. Analysts on average had expected profit per share of 62 cents. Accenture said its consulting business, particularly systems integration, has been hit by a slowdown since January and that several of its operating groups experienced either a decline or slower growth in revenue during the second quarter. Green said customers appeared to have gained a clearer sense of the future since February, but the company still lowered its full-year revenue forecast to flat to 4 percent growth, compared with its previous estimate of 6 to 10 percent gain. "I think now, people are getting a better sense for what '09 is going to be like. For most of them it's not great news, but at least there's more knowledge of what you're going to be dealing with," Green said. Accenture shares fell to $28.85 in after-hours trade after closing at $31.96 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by Ritsuko Ando; Editing by  Gary Hill ,  Richard Chang )
