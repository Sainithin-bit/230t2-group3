 ZURICH  (Reuters) - Swiss drugmaker Roche Holding AG ( ROG.VX ) said on Thursday it controlled a total of 96.2 percent of Genentech DNA.N shares after completing its tender offer for the 44 percent stake it did not already own. 

 Roche said remaining holders of Genentech shares would revive $95 a share. Genentech will cease to be traded on the New York Stock Exchange, Roche said. After a drawn-out battle, the Swiss drugmaker finally clinched a deal earlier this year for part of the U.S. biotech group it did not own for $46.8 billion.
