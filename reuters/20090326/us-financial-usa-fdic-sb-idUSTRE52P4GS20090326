 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp would be the conservator of failed non-bank financial firms under the U.S. Treasury's proposed bill seeking authority to seize them to avoid catastrophic bankruptcies, a Treasury spokesman said on Thursday. 

 Under the proposal, the Treasury would build on the FDIC's existing authority to seize banks and thrifts, but a decision to seize control of a non-bank institution would require involvement of the Treasury Secretary, the Federal Reserve and be done in consultation with the U.S. president. The intention is that the FDIC will be the conservator of seized firms, Treasury spokesman Andrew Williams said. (Reporting by  David Lawder ; Editing by Theodore d'Afflisio)
