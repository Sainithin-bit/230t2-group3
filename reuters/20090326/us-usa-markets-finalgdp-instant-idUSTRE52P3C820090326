 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. economy contracted slightly more than previously estimated in the fourth quarter, pulled down by falling consumer spending and exports, while corporate profits plunged by the biggest margin since 1994, government data showed on Thursday. 

 The number of workers collecting state unemployment benefits rose to a record 5.56 million earlier this month, while new claims rose to 652,000 in the week ended March 21, the Labor Department said on Thursday. KEY POINTS: GDP: * Gross domestic product, which measures the total output of goods and services within U.S. borders, fell at an annual rate of 6.3 percent in the October-December quarter, the steepest decline since the first quarter of 1982, the department said. * The government last month estimated the fall in fourth-quarter GDP at 6.2 percent and the modest revisions to the output estimates reflected adjustments to business inventories and investment figures. * Analysts had forecast fourth-quarter GDP contracting by 6.5 percent. * Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of domestic economic activity, dropped a 4.3 percent rate, unchanged from last month's estimates. * Exports were down 23.6 percent, also unrevised from last month's report. * Corporate profits after taxes plummeted by 10.7 percent, the biggest decline since the first quarter of 1994. * Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast corporate profits sliding by 2.0 percent in the fourth quarter. JOBLESS CLAIMS: * Analysts polled by Reuters had expected continued claims to total about 5.48 million during the week ended March 14, the most recent data available. * The number of new claims for the week of March 21 had been forecast at 650,000.
