 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Southwest Airlines ( LUV.N ) reached a tentative agreement with flight attendants for a four-year contract through May 31, 2012, the Dallas-based carrier said on Thursday. 

 Earlier in the day, the board of Transport Workers Union Local 556 voted for the tentative pact to be presented to the flight attendants for their vote, Southwest said. Members will have a chance to vote on ratification over the next few weeks, said Southwest, the largest U.S.-based low-cost carrier. Negotiations with TWU Local 556, which represents 9,800 flight attendants, began in May, Southwest said. It is separate from TWU Local 555, which represents 7,200 other workers at the carrier. In November, talks with TWU Local 555 were stalled as the union and the company could not agree on wages. The unit and Southwest filed for federal mediation on October 31. A spokesman for Southwest said TWU Local 555 tentatively agreed to a contract a couple of months ago and were set to vote on it "very soon." Southwest shares were up 5 percent at $6.45.
