 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Liquidation sales at Circuit City boosted demand for consumer electronics during Best Buy Co Inc's ( BBY.N ) fourth quarter, but it is unclear if that means demand in its current first quarter will be weakened, Best Buy's president said in an interview on Thursday. 

 "When there's an event like the Circuit going-out-of-business sale, it absolutely draws attention to the categories and gets customers out, looking and interested," said Brian Dunn, who will become Best Buy's CEO in June. When asked if that means that its current-quarter results will be hurt after shoppers spent money on electronics in its fourth quarter, which ended February 28, Dunn said: "The truth of the matter is it's unclear." Circuit City filed for bankruptcy protection in November but after failing to reach a deal to sell the company, the consumer electronics retailer said it would liquidate its assets and shutter hundreds of stores. Circuit City liquidation sales were held from the end of January through early March, which overlapped with Best Buy's fourth quarter. Earlier in the day, Best Buy reported a 23 percent drop in fourth-quarter profit, but its adjusted results for the quarter -- which included December, January and February -- topped Wall Street estimates. For the current fiscal year, Best Buy said it expects same-store sales to be flat to down 5 percent and it expects full-year earnings of $2.50 to $2.90 per share. Analysts, on average, were expecting $2.45 per share. Dunn also said that the trend of consumers "cocooning," or spending more time at home and staying connected to loved ones, is helping drive demand for consumer electronics, like computers or mobile phones. He said that during the fourth quarter demand was stronger than expected for flat screen TVs, and Best Buy found its inventory level could not meet that demand. Dunn said the TV inventory situation is getting "materially better." Despite the downturn, he said Best Buy did "not see demand fall by the wayside" for its Geek Squad technology support, which sells services like home theater installation and wireless network set-up.
