 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc ( DPS.N ) reported an adjusted quarterly profit on Thursday that topped analysts' estimates, helped by higher-than-expected concentrate sales and expanded distribution of the soft drink Crush. 

 The company also forecast earnings for 2009 that could top analysts' estimates. On a net basis, the soft drink maker reported a loss of $621 million, or $2.44 per share, in the fourth quarter, versus a net profit of $138 million, or 54 cents per share, a year ago. Excluding items, the maker of 7UP, Motts juice and Hawaiian Punch earned 39 cents per share, topping analysts' average estimate of 37 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Net sales were $1.38 billion, down slightly from $1.39 billion a year ago. The company forecast full-year earnings of $1.59 to $1.67 per share, excluding a one-time gain of 12 cents per share related to the termination of a contract with Hansen Natural Corp HANS.O. Analysts on average were expecting $1.60 per share for the full year, according to Reuters Estimates. (Reporting by  Martinne Geller ; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)
