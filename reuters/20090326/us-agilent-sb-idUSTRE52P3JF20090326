 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Agilent Technologies Inc is reducing its workforce by 2,700 people, or 14 percent, in response to a steep reduction in revenue expected for 2009 due to the weak economy and "no prospects for a meaningful recovery in the foreseeable future." 

 The company said a restructuring of its electronic measurement business would have a cash cost of $160 million but would reduce annual costs by $300 million. It also expects another $10 million in cost-cutting in its semiconductor and board test segment from the job cuts. Agilent said it expects fiscal 2009 revenue in its electronic measurement business to fall roughly 30 percent from 2008 to the lowest in its 10-year history. It also warned that revenue in its semiconductor and board test segment would be down more than 50 percent from last year and 65 percent from its peak.
