 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc's ( DPS.N ) adjusted quarterly profit topped analysts' estimates on Thursday, helped by higher-than-expected concentrate sales, and shares rose 13 percent. 

 The soft drink maker also forecast a full-year profit that could top analysts' estimates as its brands, which include 7UP, Dr Pepper and A&W, outperform the overall industry as cash-strapped consumers seek out value-priced drinks. While the company's carbonated soft drinks held up well as the overall category felt pressure, demand was weak for its premium products, especially Snapple, in the fourth quarter and into 2009, said Chief Executive Larry Young. Aside from weakness of Snapple, whose sales fell 17 percent, the company's value-priced brands seem to be off to a good start this year, said JP Morgan analyst John Faucher. As consumers "seek value and go back to what's tried and tested" the company gained market share in many U.S. markets, Young said on a conference call. The company's total share of U.S. carbonated soft drink sales increased by 20 basis points to 19.7 percent. "Even though the majority of Americans are still working, the fear factor that has gripped the nation is having a significant impact on consumer psychology," Young said. UBS analyst Kaumil Gajrawala said the company still has opportunities to gain more share from larger rivals Coca-Cola Co ( KO.N ) and PepsiCo Inc ( PEP.N ) given its plans to increase marketing, expand distribution, add more vending machines and coolers and tout the value of its Hawaiian Punch in this economy. Dr. Pepper is ahead of schedule in rolling out vending machines and coolers, and is looking at how it can get even more of its 35,000 additional machines in place before the peak summer selling season, Young said. DOLLAR PRESSURES SALES The company reported a net loss of $621 million, or $2.44 per share, in the fourth quarter, versus a net profit of $138 million, or 54 cents per share, a year ago. Results were hurt by a $696 million impairment charge to write down the values of its goodwill and distribution rights and the Snapple brand, whose premium price has led to ongoing sales declines. Excluding the impairment charge and restructuring charges, the company earned a profit of 39 cents per share, topping analysts' average estimate of a profit of 37 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Net sales fell to $1.38 billion from $1.39 billion a year ago, hurt by the stronger U.S. dollar, which reduces the value of international sales. Young said currency fluctuations and weakness in Mexico were ongoing headwinds. Excluding the impact of losing U.S. distribution of vitaminwater and Monster Energy drinks to Coke, net sales rose 3 percent as sales volume rose 1 percent. Price increases, expanded distribution of the Crush soft drink, and a build-up of inventories by third-party bottlers ahead of a January increase in concentrate prices boosted sales as consumers cut back spending in the recession. The company forecast full-year earnings of $1.59 to $1.67 per share, excluding a one-time gain of 12 cents per share related to the termination of a contract with Hansen Natural Corp HANS.O, which makes the Monster Energy drinks. It forecast sales to decline 2 percent to 4 percent from the $5.71 billion in sales it had in 2008 and for 2009 volume to be "broadly flat to down 1 percent." Analysts on average were expecting $1.60 per share for the full year on sales of $5.55 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Dr Pepper shares were up $2.13 at $17.64 on the New York Stock Exchange. Earlier in the session the shares rose to $17.89.
