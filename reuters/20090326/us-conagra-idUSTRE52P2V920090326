 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - ConAgra Foods Inc ( CAG.N ) posted a higher-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday as its consumer foods business benefited from price increases and cost cuts. 

 The company has sold off some units, such as a commodity trading and merchandising business, to focus on areas like consumer foods, which include brands like Healthy Choice frozen meals and Peter Pan peanut butter. ConAgra, whose shares rose as much as 6.3 percent on Thursday, has been trying to turn the consumer segment around by overhauling product lines and aiming to price products at points where it can cover commodity cost increases yet still attract shoppers. Profit in the consumer segment, which represents 63 percent of the company's sales, rose 6 percent in the latest quarter, excluding year-earlier restructuring charges. Some analysts had been unsure of how well the business would do. Retailers are aggressively pushing their own brands, and frozen food competitors like Nestle's ( NESN.VX ) Lean Cuisine are spending more to promote their products. ConAgra has been trying to compete in that business with a revamp of its Healthy Choice line and new products in other brands. "We are not looking to compete in that category primarily through price," CEO Gary Rodkin told investors on a conference call. But the company has made changes to its lower-priced Banquet frozen foods brand, bringing out some products at $1 to appeal to consumers seeking lower prices in the recession. "The consumer business is benefiting from pretty good value positioning, particularly with Banquet in frozen," Edward Jones analyst Jack Russo said. Profit fell to $193.2 million, or 43 cents a share, in the third quarter ended February 22, from $309.1 million, or 63 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items and discontinued operations, earnings rose to 40 cents a share from 34 cents. Analysts on average had forecast 36 cents. Sales rose 6.1 percent to $3.13 billion. A general lift in sales of packaged foods as consumers cook more at home is more than offsetting competition within individual categories, said Frost & Sullivan analyst Christopher Shanahan. ConAgra said it expected more profit improvement in the consumer segment in the current quarter as inflation moderates and new products gain ground. Still, some analysts viewed the results cautiously, noting that volume in the consumer segment fell 4 percent. A significant portion of that drop came from weakness in the peanut butter segment, which has suffered from a salmonella outbreak linked to peanut products not related to Peter Pan. Also, the company shipped less of its ACT II popcorn as it focused on the higher-margin Orville Redenbacher brand. Rodkin said he expected volume to improve from quarter to quarter in 2010. ConAgra stood by its full-year profit forecast of slightly more than $1.50 a share, excluding one-time items. ConAgra shares were up 5.7 percent at $16.45 in late morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, off an earlier high at $16.54. At Wednesday's close, the stock traded at about 9.6 times estimated 2010 earnings, the fourth-lowest multiple of the 26 companies in the Standard & Poor's 1500 Packaged Foods and Meat index .15GSPFOOD.
