 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's role as market supervisor and investor protector should not be sacrificed as Congress considers creating one entity to oversee all risk in the financial system, the head of the agency said on Thursday. 

 Outlining an aggressive agenda to police the markets, SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro said the agency would strengthen rules for money market funds and investment advisers and give shareholders more rights. "Even as attention focuses on reconsidering the management of systemic risk, investor protection and capital formation ... cannot be compromised as a product of any reform effort," Schapiro told a Senate Banking Committee hearing. Congress plans to overhaul the U.S. financial regulatory system amid the multibillion-dollar bailouts of insurer American International Group, whose hefty book of complex derivatives endangered the global financial system. Top policymakers are considering creating a powerful systemic risk regulator with the authority to look deep into financial firms other than banks, such as hedge funds and private equity companies. There is some agreement among lawmakers and the Obama administration that one regulator is needed to keep tabs on risks that could threaten the entire financial system. However, some investors fear the SEC will be stripped of power, relegated to the role of a business conduct regulator and brought under the umbrella of the Treasury Department. Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd said he had reservations about consolidating regulators and losing the SEC's role as investor protector. TOUGHER MONEY MARKET, ADVISER RULES The SEC began ramping up staff training after it was hit by intense criticism for not uncovering Bernard Madoff's $65 billion investment fraud despite red flags and whistle-blower complaints. Schapiro said she will soon ask Congress to give her authority to compensate whistle-blowers. Among other issues, Schapiro said the SEC is working on reforms to better protect investors who entrust their funds to broker-dealers and investment advisers. The SEC is considering if legislation is needed to align rules for investment advisers with those for broker-dealers. The SEC will require investment advisers with custody of client money to have an annual, surprise third-party audit to confirm the assets are safe. "I expect the staff to recommend that the commission consider requiring a senior officer from each firm to attest to the sufficiency of the controls they have in place to protect client assets," Schapiro said. Another plan is to strengthen regulation of money market funds and lessen the risk of a fund seeing a decline in its normally constant net asset value of $1 a share. The collapse last year of one of the oldest U.S. money market funds, Reserve Primary Fund, wreaked havoc among other money market funds and led the government to create a temporary program to back money market mutual fund assets. The Primary Fund suffered crippling losses linked to the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers. Schapiro's ideas were aligned with some of Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner's proposals for regulatory reform. Geithner said the SEC should develop strong requirements for money market funds to reduce the risk of rapid withdrawals that could pose greater risks to market functioning. As policymakers consider sweeping changes to U.S. financial regulation, Schapiro said the SEC may ask Congress to require hedge funds and their advisers to register with the SEC. The SEC also is mulling whether legislation was needed to plug regulatory gaps in areas such as credit default swaps and municipal securities. Responding to Democratic requests to give shareholders an easier way to nominate corporate board directors, Schapiro said the SEC may act on "proxy access" as soon as May. She reiterated support for giving shareholders more say on executives' pay. (Editing by Dave Zimmerman,  Brian Moss  and Carol Bishopric)
