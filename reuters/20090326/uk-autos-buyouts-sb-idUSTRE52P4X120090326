 (Reuters) - General Motors Corp said on Thursday that 7,500 of its U.S. hourly workers had taken buyout and early retirement offers to leave the company by April 1. 

 Here are key facts about hourly job cuts at GM, Ford Motor Co and Chrysler LLC over the past few years. * GM cut 34,000 UAW-represented factory jobs in 2006 and another 19,000 in 2008 through buyouts and early retirement incentives. Including the latest round of buyouts, the struggling automaker has cut 60,500 jobs since 2006 -- or more than half of its U.S. factory workforce. * Ford has slashed 43,000 hourly jobs since 2005. The automaker has 42,000 hourly workers under contract right now and will start a new round of buyouts on April 1 that runs through May 22. * Chrysler said on Thursday that it had extended the deadline for its 26,000 U.S. hourly workers to accept retirement incentives and buyouts to leave the company. Chrysler, which is owned by private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management, has announced nearly 22,000 hourly job cuts since February 2007.
