 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Hong Kong police have arrested a senior banker at Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ) for allegedly possessing a firearm, sources said on Friday. 

 Shen Yan, head of North Asia institutional clients group of Deutsche Bank, was arrested at Hong Kong airport last week after a gun was found in his luggage, the sources said. "This is a personal matter for Mr Yan and has nothing to do with Deutsche Bank. Mr Yan is on administrative leave from Deutsche Bank until the matter is resolved," said a spokesperson for Deutsche Bank. Yan had been granted bail and was charged by the Hong Kong police, said the sources who asked not to be identified. Yan could not be reached for comment. A spokesman for the Hong Kong police said they arrested a 43-year-old man for possession of arms without license at the Hong Kong International Airport, but declined to identify the man or give other details.
