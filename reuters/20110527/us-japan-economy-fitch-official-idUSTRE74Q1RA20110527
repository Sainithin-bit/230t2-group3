 DEAUVILLE, France  (Reuters) - Japan will continue to work on social security reform and strengthening public finances, a senior government official said on Friday, reacting to a downgrade of the country's outlook by Fitch Ratings. 

 "On the one hand, Japan is working hard to rebuild. On the other hand, it is a given that it works hard on fiscal soundness," Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Tetsuro Fukuyama told reporters at a Group of Eight summit in the northern French seaside town of Deauville. "Japan will continue to bravely face the challenges of social security reform and making its economy a stronger one, which were being debated prior to the quake," he said. Fitch cut its outlook on Japan to negative from stable citing a considerable downside risk for its public finances from still unknown costs of containing a crisis at the crippled nuclear power plant in Fukushima.
