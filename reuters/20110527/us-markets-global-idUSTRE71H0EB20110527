 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar fell broadly on Friday after weaker-than-expected U.S. consumer spending and housing data stoked worries the recovery is losing momentum, while commodities posted a third straight week of gains. 

 Wall Street stocks edged up, led by energy and materials stocks, but trading was light ahead of Monday's U.S. Memorial Day holiday. The euro briefly rose above $1.43 after reassuring comments out of Europe tempered fears of a near-term Greek default, although it slipped to another record low versus the Swiss franc as the region's debt crisis remains far from resolved. Pending sales of existing U.S. homes dropped far more than expected in April to touch a seven-month low, dealing a blow to hopes of a recovery in the housing market. Separate data showed U.S. consumer spending rose less than expected in April. "This data may give an exaggerated impression of housing's weakness, but it is pretty obvious that the key asset the Fed wishes to reflate is still struggling, which will keep the policy spigot wide open, with liquidity finding its way into more responsive asset markets," said Alan Ruskin, global head of G10 currency strategy at Deutsche Bank in New York. World equities measured by the MSCI All-Country World Index .MIWD00000PUS rose nearly 1.0 percent, though they remain on pace for their biggest monthly percentage losses in a year. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  gained 38.82 points, or 0.31 percent, to 12,441.58. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  gained 5.41 points, or 0.41 percent, to 1,331.10. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  gained 13.94 points, or 0.50 percent, to 2,796.86. The inverse correlation of the dollar to equities "seems to be a trend that you can focus on as an investor for the time being," said Michael Sheldon, chief market strategist at RDM Financial in Westport, Connecticut. "The logic is that a weaker dollar helps increase exports, sales and profits for multinational companies in the United States." Europe's FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of leading stocks added 0.7 percent. Emerging stocks .MSCIEF rose 1.2 percent. The U.S. dollar .DXY fell 0.9 percent against a basket of major currencies and hit a record low of 0.85111 Swiss franc. Expectations the Fed will keep monetary policy loose even as other major central banks are tightening have caused interest-rate differentials to move against the U.S. currency in recent months. The weaker dollar, along with persistent Middle East tensions, helped boost oil prices. U.S. crude settled at $100.59 a barrel, up 36 cents, having touched $101.24. Brent crude touched $115.68 before settling at $115.03 a barrel, off 2 cents. Spot gold hit $1,538.10 a troy ounce, its highest since May 4. Gold's appeal has also been boosted in recent weeks by Europe's debt crisis. The Reuters-Jefferies CRB index .CRB, a bellwether for commodities, was up 0.9 percent for a third week of gains, though it was set to end the month down nearly 7.0 percent after a plunge in everything from oil to silver in early May. GREECE UNCERTAINTY Worries about Greece pushed 10-year German Bund yields below the 3.0 percent level after doubts grew on Thursday over whether the International Monetary Fund would release the next aid tranche for the debt-laden country. Greece's prime minister failed to convince opposition leaders on Friday to support tougher austerity measures to free up EU/IMF aid needed to avert a debt default. But the euro gained momentum in the New York session after European Central Bank Governing Council member George Provopoulos said Greece will be able to repay its debt in full without restructuring if it sticks to its austerity plan. "Those comments reduce the near-term risk of Greek default and eased the pressure on the euro," said Joe Manimbo, currency strategist at Travelex Global Business Payments in Washington. The euro rose 1.1 percent to $1.4289, though it slipped to a record low of 1.21474 Swiss francs. The dollar lost 0.6 percent to 80.84 yen. Fitch cut its outlook on Japan's sovereign debt ratings, saying the cost of the March earthquake and tsunami and the still-unknown bill for the clean-up after the nuclear crisis would further strain the country's public finances. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes yielded 3.07 percent, up slightly from 3.06 percent late on Thursday. Investors have turned increasingly bullish on U.S. government debt as data points to sluggish growth and tepid inflation.
