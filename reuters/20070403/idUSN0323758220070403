 NEW YORK, April 3  (Reuters) - Shareholders of News Corp. NWSa.N approved a plan to swap its stake in DirecTV and $550 million cash for Liberty Media's estimated $11 billion stake in the company, solidifying Rupert Murdoch's control over the company he built.      Shareholders representing 99.76 percent of outstanding shares voted to approve the deal, which ended a two-year battle with Liberty Media LCAPA.O Chairman John Malone in December.      Liberty quietly snapped up close to a 20 percent voting stake in News Corp. in 2004, a move that spooked Murdoch, who enacted an emergency poison pill to block a feared hostile takeover.      The deal transfers News Corp.'s controlling stake in the top U.S. satellite television provider DirecTV Group Inc. DTV.N and marks Murdoch's exit from the U.S. satellite market.
