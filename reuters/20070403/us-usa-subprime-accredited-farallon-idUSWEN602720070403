 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Subprime lender Accredited Home Lenders Holding Co. LEND.O said on Monday that it had closed a $230 million loan from a San Francisco hedge fund, one of a series of moves to boost its liquidity amid an industry crisis. 

 Accredited also said it had $350 million of available cash on hand as of March 31 and that it originated $1.8 billion in mortgage loans in the U.S. and Canada in the quarter ended March 31.
