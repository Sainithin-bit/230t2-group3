 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed sharply higher on Tuesday as a drop in oil prices calmed worries about inflation and news of an unexpected rise in home sales raised hopes the housing market is stabilizing. 

 The rally took the Dow and S&P 500 to their highest levels since February 27. The drop in oil, which came as hopes grew for a diplomatic resolution to the standoff between Iran and Britain, helped buoy airlines and consumer-oriented shares such as home improvement chain Home Depot Inc. ( HD.N ), which gained 2.3 percent. The National Association of Realtors said pending home sales rose in February, off-setting Wall Street's expectations for a decline and easing concerns about fallout from the subprime mortgage troubles. The news lifted home builders' stocks, and the Dow Jones Home Construction index .DJUSHB registered its biggest gain in nearly two weeks. "A lot of this rally is sort of the flip side of fears getting too negative," said Jim Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management, in Minneapolis. "At worst things may be a little slower, but they're coming along pretty good." The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was up 128.00 points, or 1.03 percent, at 12,510.30. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was up 13.22 points, or 0.93 percent, at 1,437.77. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was up 28.07 points, or 1.16 percent, at 2,450.33. The S&P is now up 1.4 percent for the year to date, while the Dow is up 0.4 percent. The Nasdaq is up 1.5 percent. The Dow reached its highest level since February 27, when it began a sell-off after hitting a record-setting pace earlier that month. The blue-chip gauge has recovered about 60 percent of the slide that sent it tumbling in late February. Shares of retailers also rose, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ). The world's biggest retailer advanced 1.5 percent to $48.10 on the New York Stock Exchange, while the S&P retail index .RLX was up 1.5 percent. U.S. chain store sales rose 4.7 percent in week ended Saturday, according to seasonally adjusted data from Redbook Research. U.S. light crude futures fell 2 percent, or $1.30, to settle at $64.64 a barrel after Britain and Iran said they were willing to use diplomacy to end their standoff over 15 British sailors and marines seized in the Gulf.  Lower oil prices mean more spending money for consumers and corporations. The Amex airline index  .XAL  was up 3.4 percent, helped in part of the drop in oil prices, which means lower jet fuel costs. No. 4 U.S. carrier Continental Airlines Inc. CAL.N rose 8.4 percent to $39.08 after it reported March revenue rose between 4.5 percent and 5.5 percent. <ID:nN03242643 Shares of AMR Corp. AMR.N, parent of American Airlines, advanced 5.3 percent to $31.93, after it reported a rise in its March load factor. Shares of Home Depot gained 84 cents to $37.63. The stock also benefited from the brighter housing outlook. Shares of Accredited Home Lenders Holding Co. LEND.O rose a day after the subprime mortgage lender said it had secured a loan from a hedge fund, boosting its liquidity. The stock was up 18.4 percent at $10.04 on the Nasdaq. Also on the Nasdaq, shares of Google Inc. ( GOOG.O ) gained 3.1 percent to $472.60 after the Web search company inked a deal to enter the television advertising business with U.S. satellite TV operator EchoStar Communications Corp. ( DISH.O ). Altria Inc. ( MO.N ), the parent of cigarette maker Philip Morris, and plane maker Boeing Co. ( BA.N ) were also among shares providing the biggest lifts to the Dow. Shares of Altria rose 2.1 percent to $69.65 on the NYSE. Monday was the tobacco company's first day of trading since it spun off Kraft Foods Inc. KFT.N. Kraft was down 1.7 percent at $30.33. Shares of plane maker Boeing Co. ( BA.N ) were up 1.2 percent at $89.90 on the NYSE after news of more labor troubles at its European rival Airbus. ( EAD.PA ) Trading was lighter than normal on the NYSE, with many traders out this week because of the Passover and Easter holidays. About 1.56 billion shares changed hands on the NYSE, below last year's estimated daily average of 1.84 billion, while on Nasdaq, about 1.99 billion shares traded, also below last year's daily average of 2.02 billion. Advancing stocks outnumbered declining ones by a ratio of about 3 to 1 on the NYSE and by 2 to 1 on Nasdaq. (Additional reporting by  Ellis Mnyandu )
