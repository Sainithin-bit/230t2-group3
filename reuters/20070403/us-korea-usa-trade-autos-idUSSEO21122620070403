 SEOUL  (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor Co. ( 005380.KS ) and other South Korean auto companies should see a significant boost in sales following this week's trade deal with the United States, analysts and officials said on Tuesday. 

 The two countries on Monday agreed the biggest U.S. trade pact for 15 years, including tax and tariff cuts on cars along with other barrier-lifting measures on food and services. It should help South Korean manufacturers sell more vehicles not only to the world's top auto market but also at home, analysts said. "Cuts in taxes mean lower car prices and improvement in car purchase conditions, so that will lead to higher local sales," said Cho Soo-hong, an analyst at Dongbu Securities. South Korean auto makers have been struggling against weaker domestic sales, which carry higher margins than their exports, amid sluggish private consumption in Asia's third-largest economy. Jean-Marie Hurtiger, CEO of Renault's ( RENA.PA ) South Korean unit, said the change will reduce consumption taxes and will stimulate the market, especially bigger cars with engines above two liters. "We should benefit from that," Hurtiger said, referring to Renault Samsung's line of mid-sized sedans. But analysts said the tax cuts will not help Hyundai cars produced at its factory in the United States. Kia Motors ( 000270.KS ) is also planning to build a plant there. And they warned against too much optimism as the deal may intensify competition with Japanese makers in both South Korea and the U.S. "While lowering of prices by Korean automakers could lead to a price war between Japanese and Korean automakers, the prospects of entry of Japanese imports from U.S. plants into Korea are frightening," Merrill Lynch said in a research note. The United States is the biggest overseas market for South Korean car producers, accounting for 26.2 percent of their overall exports in 2006, according to the Korea Automobile Manufacturers Association. South Korea sold around 700,000 vehicles in the United States last year. Auto sales abroad account for 10 percent of total South Korean exports and are an important growth engine of Asia's third-largest economy. According to the agreement, the U.S. will immediately remove tariffs on 3,000 cc or smaller cars and auto parts from South Korea. It will also eliminate tariffs for cars bigger than 3,000 cc in three years and in 10 years for pickups. South Korea will also immediately remove tariffs on U.S. vehicles except hybrid cars. Tariffs for the hybrid models will be removed in ten years. South Korea will simplify its auto taxation, setting taxes at 5 percent in three years for both imported and domestic cars, which will result in lower taxes overall. Meanwhile, U.S. auto makers are unlikely to benefit from the agreement as South Korean consumers prefer luxury models such as Toyota Motor Corp.'s ( 7203.T ) Lexus and Germany's BMW ( BMWG.DE ) brand. "We do not see any big impact from U.S. cars. Their sales are not expected to increase dramatically," said a Hyundai official, asking not to be identified. Last year, U.S. cars represented 11.2 percent of imported cars in South Korea while European cars dominated 58.6 percent and Japanese cars had 30.1 percent, according to Korea Automobile Importers & Distributors Association. U.S. lawmakers and car makers complained about the deal with U.S. Rep. Sander Levin, who heads the House Ways and Means subcommittee on trade, saying the deal failed to lift South Korea's "iron curtain" on foreign auto imports. Merrill expects auto part makers such as Hyundai Mobis Co. ( 012330.KS ) to benefit from the trade agreement more than auto makers, saying part makers will regain a part of their price competitiveness in U.S. auto part market lost due to strength in the won currency  KRW= . Reflecting these concerns, shares in Hyundai fell 0.44 percent to end at 68,000 won underperforming the wider market's  .KS11  0.29 percent gain. But Hyundai Mobis rose 0.36 percent to 83,300 won.
