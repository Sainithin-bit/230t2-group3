 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Marshall & Ilsley Corp. MI.N, Wisconsin's largest bank, on Tuesday announced a plan to split Marshall & Ilsley and its payment-processing unit Metavante Corp. into two independent public companies. 

 M&I said Private equity firm Warburg Pincus has agreed to invest $625 million to acquire an equity stake of 25 percent in Metavante. Upon completion of the transaction, Marshall & Ilsley shareholders will receive one share of Marshall & Ilsley Corp. stock and one share of Metavante Corp. stock for every three shares of Marshall & Ilsley stock held. About $1.75 billion of new Metavante Corp. debt will be arranged by J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Morgan Stanley.
