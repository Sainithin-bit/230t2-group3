 VANCOUVER, British Columbia  (Reuters) - Manulife Financial Corp. ( MFC.TO ), Canada's biggest life insurer, could be gearing up to make a multibillion-dollar acquisition in the United States, a Canadian insurance analyst said on Tuesday. 

 Scotia Capital analyst Tom MacKinnon said Manulife's excess capital, estimated now at C$4 billion ($3.4 billion), could increase to C$6 billion by the end of next year. He noted that Manulife's pace of share buybacks, previously at around 35 percent of annual earnings per share, has dropped to less than half that level over the past nine months. "We have to believe that Manulife in particular is building an acquisition war chest," MacKinnon said in a note to clients. Manulife's last major acquisition was the C$15 billion purchase of Boston-based John Hancock Financial Services in April 2004. MacKinnon said if Manulife is to make an acquisition, it is likely to look to expand its U.S. asset management business, while also adding to its U.S. individual insurance and U.S. annuity business. Two possible targets are Des Moines, Iowa-based Principal Financial Group ( PFG.N ) and Ameriprise Financial Inc. ( AMP.N ), MacKinnon said. "Both fit the criteria, and, in addition are of similar size to the John Hancock acquisition," MacKinnon said. Principal is one of the biggest sellers of 401(k) retirement plans in the United States and analysts have flagged it for some time as a possible takeover target. Ameriprise is a brokerage and asset manager spun off from American Express. Another possibility is that Manulife may purchase Britain's Standard Life Plc. ( SL.L ), MacKinnon said. But he thought this is less likely although it would give the Toronto-based insurer a significant foothold in two new markets, the United Kingdom and continental Europe.
