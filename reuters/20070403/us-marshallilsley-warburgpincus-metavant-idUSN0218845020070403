 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Marshall & Ilsley Corp. MI.N is nearing an agreement to spin off payment processing unit Metavante Corp., with private equity firm Warburg Pincus at the same time buying a stake in a business valued at about $4 billion, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, citing unnamed sources. 

 Metavante is to be spun off to M&I shareholders, tax-free, while Warburg Pincus WP.UL pays cash for a minority stake in Metavante, the paper said. The new company is expected to be valued at about $4 billion, or more than a third of M&I's $11.7 billion market capitalization. The deal, known as a sponsored spin-off, is expected to be announced in the next few days, the paper said. Officials from M&I, a Milwaukee-based commercial bank with offices in seven states, and Warburg were not immediately available for comment. Metavante sells check processing and electronic payments services and handles transactions for the NYCE automated teller machine network. It generated 40 percent of M&I's $3.4 billion in revenue, but a fifth of its $1.2 billion pretax profit. M&I came close to floating Metavante in a 2000 IPO, but the offering was pulled when the stock market began to tumble. Warburg has made some $2.5 billion of financial technology investments over the years, the paper said. It hired former BankAmerica CEO David Coulter to help direct investment in this area for the firm's $8 billion fund. On Sunday, another private equity firm, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. KKR.UL, announced a deal to buy out credit card and payments processor First Data FDC.N for $26 billion.
