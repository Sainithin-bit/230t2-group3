 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Darden Restaurants Inc., owner of the Red Lobster and Olive Garden restaurant chains, has settled charges that it failed to fully disclose gift card fees to consumers, U.S. regulators said on Tuesday. 

 The Federal Trade Commission had charged that Darden, which also owns the Bahama Breeze and Smokey Bones chains, did not adequately tell buyers it would deduct fees if the cards were not used after a certain period of time. A monthly fee of $1.50 was deducted after 15 months of inactivity on cards sold before February 2004 and after 24 months for those sold after that. Under terms of the settlement, Darden must return the fees as well as properly inform customers about any fees or expiration dates with future gift card sales. Darden said in a statement that it now advocates eliminating gift card dormancy fees and had stopped charging the fees in October last year. It was voluntarily paying consumers back. Such gift card fees are common and aim to reduce balances on lost cards, Darden said. "We never intended for these fees to be applied to cards that weren't actually abandoned," said company spokesman Bob McAdam. The FTC said the fees were noted in fine print, often obscured by other information. In many cases, consumers who tried to redeem their cards were told they had no remaining balance and did not know about the fees. "When it comes to gift cards, issuers can't gloss over key information," Lydia Parnes, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement. "They must clearly and prominently disclose fees and restrictions." Shares of the Orlando, Florida-based company closed up 60 cents, or 1.5 percent higher, at $41.60 on the New York Stock Exchange.
