 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Australia's Wesfarmers Ltd. WES.AX said on Tuesday it planned a A$19.7 billion ($16.1 billion) takeover for underperforming retailer Coles Group Ltd. CGJ.AX, in what would be Australia's biggest ever takeover. 

 The Perth-based conglomerate emerged as a surprise contender for the country's second-largest retailer earlier on Tuesday after it took voting control of an 11.3 percent stake, potentially locking out a rival bid consortium led by buyout giant Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co KKR.UL. The indicative A$16.47 per share offer for Coles, which put itself up for sale in February, was pitched as an all-cash or cash and Wesfarmers' shares offer, Wesfarmers said. "We believe the acquisition of Coles would be a very positive step for the shareholders of both companies," Wesfarmers Managing Director Richard Goyder said in a statement. Wesfarmers was in talks with Coles to determine when it could conduct due diligence, he said. Coles' shares, which were placed on a trading halt on Tuesday pending talks with Wesfarmers, closed on April 2 at  A$16.11. "They have got a seat on the table and no one can have 100 percent control of Coles without Wesfarmers agreeing to it now," Steve Robinson, a portfolio manager with Alleron Investment Management, which owns Coles shares, said before the widely anticipated bid was launched. "Any rival bidder would have to pay above that price. So A$16.47 becomes the benchmark price." Coles Chairman Rick Allert noted the conditional proposal was non-binding, indicative and incomplete. "The Wesfarmers proposal for the whole of the company reinforces your board's view that we have a set of unique and very valuable businesses in the Coles Group," he said in a letter to shareholders. "The level of interest in these assets remains high." Premier Investments ( PMV.AX ), controlled by Melbourne millionaire and former Coles chairman Solomon Lew, earlier said it had sold its entire 5.9 percent stake for A$16.47 a share. Wesfarmers said it would restructure Coles if its bid was successful. The core food, liquor and general merchandise business would be owned by Wesfarmers and consortium partners, Macquarie Bank Ltd. MBL.AX and private equity firms Pacific Equity Partners (PEP) and Permira. Wesfarmers would own 50 percent of these businesses. Coles' Officeworks and Target businesses would be fully owned by Wesfarmers, which already owns the Bunnings hardware chain. Wesfarmers other businesses include coal mining, insurance and chemicals, but a successful takeover of Coles would skew its business mix towards the retail sector. The rival KKR team -- including Caryle Group CYL.UL, CVC CVC.UL, Texas Pacific Group TPG.UL, Bain Capital and the Blackstone Group BG.UL -- was unlikely to pursue Coles if Wesfarmers held a blocking stake, one source said. Private equity firms rarely make hostile bids. Some of the same firms are also looking at Sainsbury ( SBRY.L ) in Britain. "It makes it incredibly competitive. All they (Wesfarmers) have done is move the floor price up to A$16.47. They have a 10 percent stake which does not stop anyone from doing anything: game on!" another source told Reuters. Coles last year rejected a A$15.25 a share offer from a KKR-led consortium, but put itself back up for sale in February after its planned turnaround strategy failed to improve sales at its core supermarkets division. It has also been canvassing interest from major international retailers to try to inject some competition into the bidding process. The A$16.47 bid values Coles at about 25 times forecast earnings, according to Reuters Estimates, on a par with larger rival Woolworths Ltd ( WOW.AX ). Sainsbury trades at nearly 37 times forecast earnings versus 19.8 times for Britain's biggest supermarket group Tesco Plc. ( TSCO.L ). "The question around this whole process is who are they going to get to run this business if it is broken up," said Tyndall Investment Management analyst Craig Young. Wesfarmers, considered a private equity takeover target earlier this year, had been looking at bidding for Australian energy infrastructure group Alinta. AAN.AX but later pulled out, local media reports said. Coles is being advised by Deutsche Bank and Australian advisory firm Carnegie Wylie. Wesfarmers and its consortium partners are being advised by Greshman Advisory Partners ltd., Macquarie Bank and Allens Arthur Robinson. ($1=A$1.22)
