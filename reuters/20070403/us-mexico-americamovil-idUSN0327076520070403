 MEXICO CITY  (Reuters) - America Movil, Latin America's largest mobile phone company, is aiming to seize the lead in Brazil by making a bid to control the leading shareholder in Telecom Italia, owner of Latin American assets. 

 America Movil, controlled by Mexican tycoon Carlos Slim, wants Telecom Italia's assets to leapfrog over rival Telefonica as the biggest mobile operator in Brazil, the region's largest market. America Movil, Mexican fixed-line operator Telmex and top U.S. telephone company AT&T have together offered about 4.5 billion euros ($6 billion) for two thirds of holding company Olimpia, Telecom Italia's controlling shareholder, the companies said over the weekend. AT&T would get a third of Olimpia, with another third split between Telmex and America Movil if Italy's government lets the deal go through. America Movil tried and failed to buy Telecom Italia's Brazil assets last year. Analysts see the move for a stake in Olimpia as another bid to grab Telecom Italia's Brazil operations and its Argentine operations, but this time by attacking the problem from the top down. UNASSAILABLE LEAD Currently with more than 125 million subscribers stretching from the Rio Grande on the U.S.-Mexico border to Argentina's Patagonia, America Movil already is ahead of Telefonica in a long-running battle to be the top operator in Latin America. Winning Telecom Italia's Brazilian assets, known as TIM Participacoes, would give America Movil an unassailable lead over Telefonica in the region. "It's key," said Valmex analyst Andres Bezanilla. By combining TIM, the No. 2 player in Brazil, with its own Brazilian unit Claro, the No. 3 player, America Movil would have a market share of about 49 percent and bigger operations than Telefonica, currently the leading operator. "With America Movil's first offer to buy TIM Participacoes recently rejected by Telecom Italia, we think that buying Olimpia from Pirelli is a superior opportunity for America Movil," said Merrill Lynch analyst Mauricio Fernandes. Analysts say that America Movil has little or no interest in becoming a player in the Italian market. "We believe it unlikely that America Movil/Telmex would want to operate in Italy, a market with 138 percent penetration," Merrill's Fernandes said. "America Movil and Telmex are trying to find ways to get ahold of the Brazilian and Argentine assets given the complexity of the political scene in Italy," Fernandes said. The deal needs the blessing of the Italian government, which up to now has fought every attempt by Pirelli to sell parts of Telecom Italia to a foreign group. Telecommunications Minister Paolo Gentiloni said he is "very concerned" about the offer. That political noise has some analysts saying that the offer for Telecom Italia is far from a done deal. "We believe it is premature to take it for granted that the offer for a third of Olimpia will go through, given that there have already been declarations against the operation by members of the Italian government," said Rodrigo Ortega, an analyst at BBVA Bancomer brokerage. Another possible stumbling block is that Italian investment bank Mediobanca and insurer Generali, which joined forces with Olimpia as key investors in Telecom Italia, have first refusal on the Olimpia stake. "If Generali and the bank oppose the deal, then it is going to be difficult," Valmex's Bezanilla said.
