 TOKYO/NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Orbis Investment Management, a major shareholder of Nikko Cordial Corp. 8603.T, stepped up pressure on Citigroup ( C.N ) to raise its $14 billion bid for the Japanese broker by offering to sell its stake on the open market at a higher price. 

 Analysts dismissed the move, which offers the shares at a price well above their current market value. Orbis said it would immediately place an order on the Tokyo Stock Exchange to sell its entire 5.8 percent stake, adding that it believed Citigroup's offer of 1,700 yen per share for Nikko materially undervalued the company. In a statement issued late on Monday in New York, Orbis said it would offer its 56.5 million shares in Japan's No. 3 brokerage at 1,900 yen each -- nearly 12 percent above Citi's offer price and 13 percent higher than their market value. It said offers by any other shareholders who share its view and follow its example "will be visible to the market in the order book of the Tokyo Stock Exchange." Orbis added: "This open format permits the marketplace to decide what the shares are worth." Citigroup declined to comment. Following the Orbis announcement, sell orders for 56.5 million Nikko shares at 1,900 yen each were entered on the Tokyo exchange before the start of trade on Tuesday, a trader at a Japanese brokerage said. Separate sell orders for 14.4 million Nikko shares were also placed at the same price shortly before the closing, he said. Shares in Nikko edged up 0.1 percent to end at 1,686 yen on Tuesday. Last month, Citigroup began accepting tenders for its takeover bid and said it would not increase its bid a second time. Its original offer valued Nikko at 1,350 yen per share. The tender closes on April 26. "This is just (Orbis's) way of announcing to the world that they have no intention of accepting the bid below 1,900 yen, and does not mean much more," said a banking analyst at a foreign brokerage in Japan. Citigroup raised its bid price after Nikko escaped a possible delisting by the Tokyo Stock Exchange over an accounting scandal. The stock's continued listing weakened the U.S. bank's leverage against North American investors, who had dismissed its offer as too low. Orbis said it is concerned "that the process which led to the Citigroup tender offer was not conducted in an open and transparent manner that would allow the market a full opportunity to determine the true value of Nikko Cordial." Bermuda-based Orbis said its actions furthered its fiduciary responsibilities to clients in view of the specific circumstances of the Citigroup tender offer, "which Orbis believes inadequately serve the interests of its clients." PROSPECTS FOR CITI'S DEAL Citigroup, the largest U.S. bank, already holds roughly 5 percent of Nikko and is offering to buy all shares tendered as it aims for a minimum stake of 50 percent. Management at Nikko has agreed to the Citigroup deal, which would be the biggest-ever foreign buyout of a Japanese company. One major Nikko shareholder, Mizuho Financial Group Inc. ( 8411.T ), will tender all of its shares in Nikko to Citigroup, a source close to the matter said on March 16, boosting the chances the takeover bid will succeed. Mizuho Corporate Bank, Mizuho Financial Group's corporate lending arm, holds a 4.8 percent stake in Nikko, which agreed to be taken over by Citigroup after its accounting scandal led to a downturn in business and an executive shake-up. Two other big shareholders of Nikko have said recently, however, that the brokerage is worth a lot more than Citigroup's offer. Southeastern Asset Management, which controls about 6.6 percent, said on March 23 it increased its appraisal of Nikko's value above its initial assessment of 2,000 yen per share. Harris Associates LP, which controls about 6 percent, has also told news media that Nikko shares are worth more than 2,000 yen. (Additional reporting by  David Dolan  in Tokyo)
