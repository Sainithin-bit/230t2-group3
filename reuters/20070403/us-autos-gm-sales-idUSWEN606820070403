 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) said on Tuesday its U.S. sales fell 7.7 percent in March as the world's largest automaker cut back on fleet sales. 

 GM said it sold 349,867 vehicles in the United States last month, down from 365,375 a year earlier. Fleet sales -- which typically go to car rental companies and government agencies -- fell 11.8 percent. GM is cutting back on the low-margin sales. Retail sales, which occur on showroom floors, fell 6.2 percent, driven by big declines in sport utility vehicles. The results have been adjusted for an extra selling day in March 2007. GM, which lost $10.4 billion in 2005 and more than $3 billion in 2006, is in the middle of a sweeping restructuring that includes slashing more than 34,000 jobs and closing 12 plants. The automaker, which has been cutting production to better align it with declining sales, on Tuesday reduced its second-quarter North American production forecast to 1.16 million vehicles, down 15,000 from an estimate it provided last month. In the first quarter, GM produced 1.06 million vehicles in North America -- down 15 percent, or 192,000 vehicles, from a year earlier.
