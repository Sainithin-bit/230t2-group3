 MUNICH  (Reuters) - The defense chief of European aerospace firm EADS said he expects profitability to improve by a third in the medium term and that the division will help to counter the financial crisis at the group's Airbus unit. 

 Stefan Zoller told journalists in Unterschleissheim, near Munich, on Tuesday he was aiming for a return on sales of 8 percent in three to five years, up from 5.9 percent last year, mainly boosted by organic growth. But he said he would still look at acquisitions, also in the key U.S. defense market, despite the impact of problems at planemaker Airbus on parent EADS's buying power. "We are targeting organic growth in the future," Zoller said at the EADS defense headquarters. But "whenever we see that there are opportunities to grow through acquisitions, we will do it." The defense head said he saw no substantial growth in sales this year from its 5.864 billion euros ($7.8 billion) last year, and that 2007 earnings before interest and tax would be no worse than the 348 million euros achieved last year, leaving scope for improvement. Zoller also wanted to boost the portion of sales from exports to 30 percent from 22 percent, without giving an exact timeframe. An industrial crisis at Airbus that is set to cost 10,000 jobs, half of them at suppliers and independent contractors, slashed operating profit at the EADS group by 86 percent to 399 million euros last year. This led some politicians to threaten not to award EADS defense contracts. But Zoller said on Tuesday that the defense business had so far weathered any impact from Airbus and that the unit had not lost a single contract as a result. EADS still did not plan to buy a tank maker, such as Krauss Maffei or Rheinmetall, though it was still interested in buying out its MBDA missile business partners BAE Systems and Finmeccanica, Zoller added. EADS and BAE each hold 37.5 percent of MBDA, while Finmeccanica owns 25 percent. "If the English or the Italians want to sell, we are always open to talks," Zoller said. "That is nothing new." Zoller is meanwhile banking on new markets and new business, such as domestic security and unmanned spyplanes, to help boost sales in the face of flat domestic defense budgets. EADS was in advanced negotiations with the governments of Spain, France and Germany about developing an unmanned aircraft, dubbed Advanced UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle), Zoller said, as the European company attempts to match U.S. and Israeli prowess in the building of spyplanes. He did not give further details. The firm also planned to build a new unmanned aircraft test model to demonstrate technology after its Barracuda prototype crashed into the sea off Spain in September when a software error caused it to land prematurely. The new demonstrator would be codenamed Agile UAV. Shares in EADS were 1.1 percent higher at 23.61 euros by 1211 GMT in Paris.
