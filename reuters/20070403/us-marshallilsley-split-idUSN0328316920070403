 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Marshall & Ilsley Corp. MI.N, Wisconsin's largest bank, announced a plan on Tuesday to separate its Metavante Corp. payment processing unit in a deal valuing Metavante at about $4.25 billion, including debt. 

 Private equity firm Warburg Pincus would invest $625 million for a 25 percent stake in Metavante, while M&I shareholders would own the remainder. Analysts said the split, announced one day after payment processor First Data Corp. FDC.N agreed to go private in a $26 billion transaction, reflects a desire among financial services companies to realize greater value from back-office operations such as processors. The plan would split Marshall & Ilsley and Metavante into two independent public companies. "The payment-processing technology area is attractive because it has stable cash flows and there is capacity for buyers to add more debt," said Richard Hofmann, a financial services analyst with CreditSights Inc. Metavante generated about one-fifth of M&I's $807.8 million net income in 2006. It would keep its top management and employ about 5,500 people. Metavante operates technology programs for check processing and other forms of electronic payments. It is based in Milwaukee, as is M&I. M&I shares closed Tuesday up $3.97, or 8.7 percent, at $49.83, after the Wall Street Journal reported the possible separation. They rose to $50.49 in after-hours electronic trading after M&I confirmed the plans. "We think of this as a real growth equity play. We intend to stay with this thing for the long term," said Warburg Pincus managing director David Coulter, the former vice chairman of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Private equity firms typically take controlling stakes in mature, but undervalued companies, hold the businesses for two to four years, and sell them later. "If you focus on the (payment processing) sector, there is big growth internationally," Coulter said in an interview with Reuters. Warburg Pincus will get three board seats, according to Tuesday's statement. Among Warburg's financial services investments are TradeCard, Synesis and FundsXpress. TAX FREE M&I shareholders would receive one Metavante share and one share of the surviving M&I for every three M&I shares they now own. The plan envisions a spinoff of M&I and is intended to be tax free to its shareholders. M&I's board has approved the transaction, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter. "This transaction will create two well-positioned public companies and will provide substantial benefits to the shareholders of both companies," M&I Chief Executive Dennis Kuester said in a statement. M&I said the transaction gives Metavante an enterprise value of $4.25 billion, including $1.75 billion of new debt being arranged by JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley. M&I has about $56.2 billion of assets and more than 320 banking offices, including 193 in Wisconsin. Its network also includes 77 offices in Arizona and Florida. The company employs 14,700 people, including those at Metavante. David George, an analyst at A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc., wrote that a spinoff could boost speculation about a possible sale of M&I itself. He said the banking unit would be "an extremely attractive franchise" for larger banks, including foreign ones, looking to expand in the Midwest. JPMorgan advised M&I and Morgan Stanley advised Warburg Pincus on the transaction. (Additional reporting by  Michael Flaherty )
