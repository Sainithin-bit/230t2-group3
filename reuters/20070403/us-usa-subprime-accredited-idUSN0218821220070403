 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Accounting firm Grant Thornton resigned as auditor for two troubled subprime lenders, the companies said on Monday in separate regulatory filings. 

 The two lenders, Accredited Home Lenders Holding Co. LEND.O and Fremont General Corp. FMT.N, said separately that Grant Thornton had resigned as their auditor after advising them that it needed to "significantly expand" the scope of its audit of their 2006 financial statements. Accredited, Fremont and other lenders to home buyers with weak credit histories have struggled in recent months amid rising defaults and a downturn in residential real estate. News of Grant Thornton's resignation comes on the same day that New Century Financial Corp. ( NEWC.PK ), a leader in the once-booming subprime lending industry, filed for bankruptcy. Both firms said they were now seeking new independent auditors but that there was no guarantee that they would be able to find them. Both companies' shares fell in after-hours trading. Fremont General slid 11 percent to $5.80, while Accredited fell 3.3 percent to $8.20. Officials at Grant Thornton could not immediately be reached for comment.
