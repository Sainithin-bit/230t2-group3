 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) said on Tuesday that U.S. sales had fallen 9 percent in March, hurt by a cutback in fleet sales and weaker demand for its F-Series pickup trucks. 

 The second-largest U.S. automaker said it had sold 264,975 vehicles in the United States in March, compared with 291,146 a year earlier. The results are not adjusted for an extra selling day last month.
