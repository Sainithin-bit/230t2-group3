 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Amgen Inc. ( AMGN.O ), the world's largest biotechnology company, will delay by two years construction of new drug manufacturing operations in Cork, Ireland, a company spokeswoman said on Tuesday. 

 The decision came after a "periodic review" of manufacturing facilities, and was not based on expectations that patient demand would change, said spokeswoman Ann McNickle. The first phase of the Irish plant had been expected to open in 2010, but will now be delayed until at least 2012, according to Thousand Oaks, California-based Amgen. Amgen had announced in January 2006 plans to invest more than $1 billion in the new process development, bulk manufacturing and finish facilities in order to have production capacity closer to the patients it serves in Europe. The plant is scheduled to employ 1,100 people.
