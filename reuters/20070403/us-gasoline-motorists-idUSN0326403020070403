 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - When gasoline prices surge, U.S. drivers will do almost anything to lessen the sting of filling up their tanks -- except drive less, according to the National Association of Convenience Stores. 

 Motorists in the world's largest energy consumer are expected to see pump prices rise during the summer months, when demand traditionally jumps with vacation travel. And despite surging gasoline costs over the past two summers -- including to a record spike over $3 a gallon in 2005 after oil sector disruptions from Hurricane Katrina -- consumers are more likely to change the way they buy fuel than cut back on driving, the store group said. "High gasoline prices have not changed American's driving habits, but they have significantly changed their purchasing habits," said Jeff Lenard, a spokesman for the group which represents the 114,000 convenience stores that sell three-quarters of all U.S. gasoline. On Tuesday, U.S. drivers paid an average of $2.696 a gallon to fill up their tanks with regular fuel, about 23 cents higher than they paid last month but still below records of $3.057 after Katrina, according to AAA travel club. Gasoline demand is expected to keep growing at last year's pace of 2 percent, leading to higher prices this summer. Lenard said motorists' efforts to soften the pain at the pump are often fruitless and end up costing more in the long run. Common practices such as driving past gasoline stations to find lower prices and shave a few pennies off a gallon can burn off extra fuel and erase any savings. "They shop around more, sometimes to their detriment," said Lenard, who noted the study shows the quest to save a couple pennies per gallon sometimes turns into a more expensive proposition. "It works out to spending $2 to save 50 cents in gasoline. You are spending money to save money." About 47 percent of drivers say they are more likely to purchase fuel with credit cards, just to delay the psychological sting of a costly fill-up, according to a study by the group. But a $2.50 gallon of gasoline bought on credit can quickly balloon in cost and put the consumer in deeper personal debt. "They feel they are displacing their pain," Lenard said. "In reality, if you miss a payment or don't pay it off, a $2.50 gallon of gasoline can become a $3.50 a gallon very quickly."
