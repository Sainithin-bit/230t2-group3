 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc. ( BUD.N ) said on Tuesday it will build a brewery in Foshan, China, to help reach its goal of doubling the distribution of its Budweiser beer in China over the next five years. 

 The largest U.S. brewer said it will make Budweiser available to an additional 150 million potential beer drinkers by bringing it to 100 new cities, each with a population of at least a million people. The company also said it will introduce the domestic brew Harbin to 33 new markets in 2007. The Foshan brewery, in Guangdong province, is scheduled for completion in late 2008 at a cost of $63 million. It will have a production capacity of 2.6 million hectoliters with a potential for expansion, the company said. Anheuser-Busch has already invested over $1 billion in mainland China, the world's largest beer market by volume, helping it become the St. Louis-based brewer's largest and fastest-growing overseas market. The company owns Chinese brewers Harbin Brewery Group and Wuhan Brewing Co. as well as a stake in Tsingtao Brewery Co. Ltd. ( 600600.SS ), China's largest beer maker. Anheuser-Busch, which is facing steep competition for its Budweiser and Bud Light in the United States from imported and craft beers, also recently began importing Grupo Modelo's ( GMODELOC.MX ) Corona Extra into China. Mexico's Modelo is half owned by Anheuser-Busch. China's beer market grew nearly 15 percent in 2006, the third consecutive year of double-digit volume growth, according to the company. Anheuser-Busch shares rose 27 cents, or less than 1 percent, to $50.97 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. (Additional reporting by  Anupreeta Das )
