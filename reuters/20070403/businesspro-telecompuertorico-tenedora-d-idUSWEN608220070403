 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A subsidiary of Mexico's America Movil 
SA ( AMXL.MX ) has bought Telecomunicaciones de Puerto Rico Inc 
for $1.9 billion, according to a U.S. regulatory filing from 
the Puerto Rican company on Tuesday. 

  The deal, which was consummated on March 30, stemmed from 
an agreement by GTE Holdings LLC to sell its shares in 
Telecomunicaciones de Puerto Rico to Sercotel, according to the 
filing, which said Sercotel assigned its rights under the 
agreement to its affiliate, Tenedora.  America Movil ( AMX.N ) is controlled by Mexican tycoon 
Carlos Slim.
