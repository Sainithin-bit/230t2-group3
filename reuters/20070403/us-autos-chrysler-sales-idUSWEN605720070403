 DETROIT  (Reuters) - DaimlerChrysler AG DCXGn.DE said on Tuesday that its U.S. sales had fallen 4 percent in March as weaker sales at its Chrysler unit offset increased sales at its Mercedes brand. 

 The German automaker said it had sold 228,047 vehicles in the United States last month, compared with 237,829 a year earlier. Sales at Chrysler Group, which includes the Jeep, Dodge and Chrysler brands, fell 5 percent, while sales at Mercedes-Benz rose 1 percent. Results were not adjusted for an extra selling day last month.
