 BERLIN  (Reuters) - German government officials and General Motors reached no agreement on a buyer for carmaker Opel on Wednesday, but German representatives expressed a preference for Magna, a senior government official said. 

 "We expressed a qualified preference for Magna," said Jochen Homann, head of the government's Opel Task Force, after the talks with GM negotiators on the three bids for Opel in Berlin. He said the response from GM was "guarded." The three bids being considered for Opel are from Belgian financial investor RHJ, China's Beijing Automotive and Magna. (Reporting by  Gernot Heller )
