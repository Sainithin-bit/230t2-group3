 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley said on Wednesday it saw stronger earnings from commodities in the second quarter despite a sharp drop in the risk it took trading those markets. 

 The New York-based bank, which together with Goldman Sachs represent the two largest players in commodities on Wall Street, said its value at risk (VaR) in commodities fell 65 percent from the second quarter of 2008. VaR stands for the maximum that could potentially be lost trading any market on a single day. Morgan Stanley's results showed that its commodities VaR fell to $23 million in the quarter ended June 30, from $38 million a year ago and $26 million in the first quarter of this year. For the second quarter, it reported a $1.26 billion loss applicable to common shareholders. But it said commodities results were "higher" from a year ago. It did not elaborate.
