 TRAPPENKAMP, Germany  (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed support for Magna's bid for carmaker Opel on Wednesday, saying the Canadian supplier's plan was in all respects the most sustainable. 

 She also told reporters during a visit to a small firm in northern Germany that the talks between German government officials and General Motors would take a few more days. GM and Germany are considering three bids for Opel -- one from Belgian financial investor RHJ and one from China's Beijing Automotive as well as Magna's offer. (Reporting by Jan Schwartz)
