 SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - It is still "too risky" to conclude that the declining trend in global trade has bottomed and a weak European performance means China is expected to overtake Germany as the biggest merchandise exporter this year, World Trade Organization's chief economist said on Wednesday. 

 "It is quite risky predicting that we are now bottomed out because there are sort of things that could go wrong, (it is) so fragile," Patrick Low told Reuters in an interview on the sidelines of an Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Singapore. He also said if the current trend continues, China will overtake Germany as the biggest merchandise exporter by the end of the year.
