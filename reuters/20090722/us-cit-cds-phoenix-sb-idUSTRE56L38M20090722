 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The cost to insure the debt of embattled U.S. lender CIT Group Inc ( CIT.N ) rose early on Wednesday. 

 The lender warned on Tuesday that even though it got emergency funding from bondholders, it might still be forced into bankruptcy. CIT's credit default swaps rose to about 50 percent as an upfront cost, from about 47 percent late on Tuesday afternoon, according to Phoenix Partners Group data.
