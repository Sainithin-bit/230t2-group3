 SEOUL  (Reuters) - LG Electronics Inc ( 066570.KS ) on Wednesday reported a surge in second-quarter operating profit as the strength of its mobile phone and TV businesses helped the company recover from the downturn faster than its peers. 

 LG, the world's No. 3 mobile phone maker, posted a global-basis operating profit of 1.13 trillion won ($903 million) for April-June, soundly beating a 988 billion won average profit forecast from nine analysts polled by Reuters. That was up 32 percent from an 856 billion won profit a year earlier and compares with a 456 billion won profit in the first quarter. LG's second-quarter net profit of 1.15 trillion won was much bigger than a 707 billion won profit in the year-ago period and marked a turnaround from a 198 billion net loss in the previous quarter. New premium products such as the multimedia touch screen phone ARENA, steady sales of mid-range phones and price competitiveness from a weaker won are helping LG expand market share in mobile phones despite the current downturn. The outlook is also bright due to strong sales of flat-screen TVs and improving earnings at liquid crystal display (LCD) affiliate LG Display Co Ltd ( 034220.KS ), analysts said.
