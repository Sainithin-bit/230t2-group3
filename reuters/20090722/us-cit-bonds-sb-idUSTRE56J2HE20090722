 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The price of U.S. lender CIT's ( CIT.N ) debt slipped early on Wednesday. 

 The price of CIT's floating rate notes due in August fell to 83 cents on the dollar early on Wednesday from 85.5 cents on the dollar late on Tuesday, according to MarketAxess. The lender warned on Tuesday that although it obtained emergency funding from bondholders, it might still be forced into bankruptcy. (Reporting by  John Parry ; Editing by  Chizu Nomiyama )
