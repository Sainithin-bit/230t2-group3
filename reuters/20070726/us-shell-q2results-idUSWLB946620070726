 LONDON  (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell Plc ( RDSa.L ) bucked an industry-wide trend of falling earnings on Thursday, posting a 20 percent rise in second-quarter profits as fat refining margins helped outweigh lower output. 

 Shell said its current cost of supply (CCS) profit, which strips out changes in the value of inventories, rose to $7.556 billion. Excluding a non-operating gain of $660 million, partly related to asset sales, underlying profits rose 5 percent to $6.896 billion, beating an average forecast of $6.770 billion given in a Reuters poll of 10 analysts. It is the eighth straight quarter when the world's second-largest, non-government controlled oil company by market value has beaten analysts' forecasts, suggesting it has turned the corner after difficult years when it admitted overstating reserves and announced multi-billion cost overruns on key fields. Shell's London-traded A shares were up 2.54 percent at 2019 pence at 0934 GMT, outperforming a 1.6 percent rise in the DJ Stoxx European Oil and Gas sector index. "We will be moving our forecasts higher to reflect the strong headline earnings," Peter Hitchens at Teather & Greenwood said. The company said production of oil and gas fell 2 percent to 3.178 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), in line with analysts' expectations. The fall was partly due to Nigerian fields being shut in because of security problems and a warm winter in northwest Europe, which hit demand for North Sea gas. Hague-based Shell declined to offer any guidance on a restart of the shut in Nigeria operations and Chief Executive Jeroen van der Veer told a conference call with reporters that output for the year would be at the lower end of the company's 3.3-3.5 million boepd target range. High oil prices underpinned the results although realizations were in line with the levels achieved in the same period last year. Refining division earnings jumped over 40 percent thanks to high margins and better fuel retail margins. Analysts at Cazenove described the refining result as "very strong". Shell's profits compare with big drops in underlying second-quarter earnings at BP Plc ( BP.L ), Italy's ENI SpA ( ENI.MI ) and Spain's Repsol ( REP.MC ). However, Chief Executive Jeroen van der Veer warned higher industry costs could keep up the pressure on profits. This trend is leading to strong earnings at service providers, with France's Technip ( TECF.PA ), which makes oil rigs, refineries and natural gas facilities, reporting a 55 percent rise in second-quarter profits earlier on Thursday. Shell is increasingly relying on its Canadian oil sands operations to increase production and output from these tarry deposits doubled in the second quarter. But analysts are divided on what the long-term profit margins are for this high-cost business.
