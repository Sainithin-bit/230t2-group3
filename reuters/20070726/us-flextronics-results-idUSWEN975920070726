 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - The world's top contract electronics manufacturer, Flextronics International Ltd. ( FLEX.O ), posted a higher quarterly profit on Thursday as strong telecommunications and mobile telephone business helped drive revenue up 27 percent. 

 Shares of the company, which makes mobile phones, personal computers, digital cameras, medical devices and video game consoles for brand-name companies, rose nearly 4 percent. Flextronics said net income for its fiscal first quarter ended June 29 was $107 million, or 17 cents per share, compared with $84.5 million, or 14 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding special items such as restructuring costs and stock-based compensation expenses, the Singapore-based company earned 22 cents per share, beating the average analyst forecast of 21 cents on Reuters Estimates. Revenue was $5.16 billion, up 27 percent from a year earlier and above the average Wall Street forecast of $4.91 billion. Flextronics saw a surge of more than 40 percent in its telecommunications-related business, which accounts for about 30 percent of total revenue, Chief Financial Officer Thomas Smach told Reuters. "It's new program wins that we're adding to the fold and getting into volume production," Smach said. Mobile telephones, which account for another 30 percent of Flextronics' business, rose more than 30 percent, Smach said. The company's customers include mobile phone company Sony Ericsson ( 6758.T )( ERICb.ST ), printer and computer company Hewlett-Packard Co. ( HPQ.N ) and Xbox 360 game console seller Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT.O ). Flextronics also said it expected a second-quarter profit of between 22 cents and 24 cents per share, excluding special items, in line with the average estimate of 23 cents. Second-quarter revenue is expected to grow 10 percent to 20 percent from a year earlier, to between $5.3 billion and $5.6 billion, the company said. The average analyst estimate was $5.3 billion. Shares of Flextronics rose 44 cents, or 3.9 percent, to $11.60 after the results were announced. The shares closed down 2.8 percent on Nasdaq. Flextronics, which said in June it will buy rival Solectron Corp. SLR.N for about $3.6 billion, has seen its stock fall nearly 3 percent so far this year, compared to a drop of almost 6 percent for Jabil Circuit Inc. ( JBL.N ) and a fall of nearly 18 percent for Sanmina-SCI Corp. ( SANM.O ). The company said that the $200 million in annual savings it will achieve through the merger will kick in sooner than expected, in 12 to 18 months instead of the 18 to 24 months it previously anticipated.
