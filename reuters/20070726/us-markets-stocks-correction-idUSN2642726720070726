 (Corrects oil contract in second paragraph to September 
instead of July) 

 By  Ellis Mnyandu NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Stocks headed for a sharply lower open on Thursday as worries about a rise in oil prices, housing slump and worsening climate for financing corporate takeovers drove a global sell-off in shares. U.S. crude for September rose to $77.24 in electronic trade, stoking concern about the toll of higher energy prices on personal spending as consumers grapple with a stalled housing market. News from home builders rattled the market early, while a report showing a smaller-than-expected increase in June durable goods orders added to jitters. Investors worried about the climate for deal financing after Chrysler Group postponed a $12 billion loan to finance a private equity takeover of the company from DaimlerChrysler AG. DCXGn.DE. "The overriding issues in the market today are higher oil prices and funding issues with regard to low-quality debt," said Subodh Kumar, chief investment strategist at Subodh Kumar & Associates in Toronto. "The markets will focus more on credit and oil and we'll see some weakness today." S&P 500 futures were down 16 points, below fair value, a mathematical formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures were down 119 points, and Nasdaq 100 futures were off 19 points. Following an overnight drop in Asia, European stocks tumbled to three-month intraday lows on Thursday as investors fled riskier assets, triggering a rally in U.S. Treasuries. Home builders D.R. Horton Inc ( DHI.N ) and Beazer Homes ( BZH.N ) both posted quarterly losses before the bell, a day after rivals Ryland Group Inc ( RYL.N ) and Pulte Homes Inc ( PHM.N ) also reported second-quarter losses. Shares of Beazer Homes dropped 2 percent to $16.70 in electronic trade, while D.R. Horton shares fell 2.7 percent to $17. Tool and household appliances maker Black & Decker Corp BDK.N also soured the tone with a disappointing quarterly profit. It blamed a tough residential construction sector for its poor results.
