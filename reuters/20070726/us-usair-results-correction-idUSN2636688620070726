 (Corrects US Airways revenue figure in sixth paragraph to $3.16 billion. Error first appeared in UPDATE 1) 

 By Kyle Peterson CHICAGO  (Reuters) - US Airways Group Inc. ( LCC.N ) on Thursday reported a 14 percent decline in second-quarter net profit because of spending by the airline to improve reliability. The company, formed in 2005 from the merger of America West and US Airways, said net income fell to $263 million, or $2.77 per share, from $305 million, or $3.25 per share, a year earlier. Excluding merger-related costs and a credit from fuel hedge contracts, the carrier earned $2.74 per share. On that basis, Wall Street analysts had expected $2.66, according to Reuters Estimates. Shares of US Airways, the No. 7 U.S. airline, were down $1.60, or 4.6 percent, at $33.24 in morning New York Stock Exchange trade. Calyon Securities analyst Ray Neidl attributed the stock decline to "a little disappointment" that profit was down from a year earlier. The company said its revenue declined 0.5 percent to $3.16 billion. So far, airlines have reported a profitable second-quarter, which is typically the strongest due to the peak summer travel season. The industry has been battered in recent years by soaring fuel costs and low-fare competition that make it hard for the companies to cover their expenses. Jet fuel JET-USG spot prices along the U.S. Gulf Coast averaged about $2.06 per gallon in the second quarter, compared with about $2.07 a year earlier, according to the Energy Information Administration. US Airways paid $1.21 billion for jet fuel in the second quarter, down 1.3 percent from a year earlier. Also on Thursday, AirTran Holdings AAI.N said its second-quarter net profit amounted to $41.5 million, or 41 cents per share, compared with $32 million, or 32 cents per share, a year earlier. Shares of the parent of low-cost airline AirTran Airways were down nearly 2 percent. Alaska Air Group Inc. ( ALK.N ), parent of Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air, reported quarterly net income of $46.1 million, or $1.13 per share, down from $55.5 million, or $1.38 per share, a year earlier. Its stock fell nearly 6 percent. OPERATIONAL UPGRADES AND REVENUE OUTLOOK In a statement, US Airways Chief Executive Doug Parker linked the airline's profit decline to costs from a plan to improve reliability after the company suffered a glitch in its self-service reservations system in the first quarter. The plan, which was announced in April, called for hiring more than 1,000 airport workers, upgrading kiosk equipment and expanding connect times at some hub airports. "Although high fuel prices will continue to have a material financial impact on our company, we are encouraged by the strengthening revenue environment and industry capacity outlook," Parker said in a statement. "Looking forward, we maintain our projections of profitability for the third quarter and full-year 2007," he said. US Airways is still merging the operations of its two component carriers. It hopes to have a single operating certificate reflecting its status as a single airline this fall. Meanwhile, the company has yet to fully merge the unionized workers of the former US Airways and American West. The lack of progress toward integration is a sore spot for the workers, but US Airways has said separate work forces is no hindrance. The company ended the quarter with $3.5 billion in total cash and investments, of which $3 billion was unrestricted. (Reporting by Kyle Peterson)
