 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said on Thursday that U.S. lawmakers and business interests should be seeking to broaden and simplify taxation as well as lower tax rates. 

 Speaking at a conference on tax policy sponsored by the Treasury Department, Greenspan deplored that the benefits achieved from a widely admired 1986 tax overhaul had been "almost fully unwound" by various tax breaks, credits and other changes. "I think we should go back to broaden the base and lower the rates and then figure out a political way to keep it there." Greenspan said. He said the ink had "barely dried" on the 1986 tax overhaul before interest groups began chipping away at it. The former Fed chief left little doubt that he thought the current corporate tax structure was unwieldy and put a damper on companies' ability and willingness to invest. "There is evidence out there, still fragmentary, that our rate of innovation which had been surging during the 1990s has slowed down really quite dramatically," Greenspan said. He said that was evident in a high rate of stock buybacks that reflected an unwillingness to make more investments. That has a damaging impact that can be lasting, he warned. "Anything which is anti-competitive, which our corporate tax rate is, strikes me as something we should be quite concerned about because we're not getting the benefits that we were getting previously with this dramatic innovation," Greenspan said. He noted that a key reason cited for the surge in U.S. productivity during the 1990s was that prices for high-technology goods were falling, but he said "that process of falling prices in technology has dramatically slowed." Always a fiscal conservative, Greenspan cautioned that a prerequisite for any attempt at overhauling U.S. corporate tax rates would be to ensure that government spending was under control so that there would not be concern that revenues might be pinched. He also deplored what he said were signs that the United States was "gradually moving toward a protectionist, closed society" and warned that would be "extraordinarily damaging to our standards of living."
