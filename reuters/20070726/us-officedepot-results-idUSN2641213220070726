 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Office Depot Inc. ( ODP.N ), the world's second-largest office supplies retailer, on Thursday said quarterly profit fell because of "continued softness" in the economy and lower demand for office furniture and supplies. 

 The retailer said second-quarter earnings fell to $109 million, or 40 cents per share, from $118 million, or 41 cents, a year earlier. Excluding special items, Office Depot said it earned 43 cents a share for the quarter. On that basis, analysts, on average, were expecting Office Depot to earn 43 cents a share for the quarter. The Delray Beach, Florida-based company, which operates 1,186 stores in the United States and Canada, said quarterly revenue rose 4 percent to $3.6 billion. The average Reuters estimate was about $3.7 billion. The company warned last month that soft economic conditions would hurt its domestic sales and quarterly earnings. "We knew we were facing significant head winds as we entered the second-quarter this year, a quarter which also is seasonally our lowest point for sales," Chief Executive Steve Odland said in a statement. The company also blamed declines in U.S. home construction and rising fuel prices. Total sales at Office Depot's North American division climbed 1 percent to $1.5 billion, but comparable store sales in the division slipped 5 percent. International sales increased 14 percent to $1 billion, the company said, boosted by increases in its contract business. Looking ahead, Office Depot sees capital expenditures in 2008 ranging between $500 million and $550 million, down from its $600 million forecast in the first-quarter. The reduced figure is a result of Office Depot expecting to open fewer stores than previously planned, the company said. (Reporting by  Justin Grant )
