 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Tool maker Black & Decker Corp. BDK.N on Thursday said quarterly profit fell, citing the tough U.S. residential construction sector and higher commodity prices. 

 "Looking ahead, we expect that the weak U.S. housing industry and significant commodity inflation will continue to adversely affect our earnings comparisons," Chief Executive Nolan Archibald said in a statement. Net income in the second quarter fell to $118 million, or $1.75 a share, compared with $152.2 million, or $1.98 a share, in the year-earlier quarter. Analysts on average had expected the Towson, Maryland-based maker of DeWalt drills and Kwikset locks to earn $1.73 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales were $1.7 billion, flat with the year-earlier quarter and just topping analysts' average estimate of $1.66 billion. The Towson, Maryland, company said it anticipates flat third-quarter sales and earnings per share between $1.40 and  $1.45. Analysts on average had forecast third-quarter EPS of $1.60 on sales of $1.6 billion. For the full year, Black & Decker sees earnings per share between $6.35 and $6.50, compared with analysts' estimate of  $6.50. Black & Decker also set a regular quarterly dividend of 42 cents per share. (Reporting by  Helen Chernikoff , with additional reporting by Ben Klayman in Chicago)
