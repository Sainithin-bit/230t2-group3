 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - H&R Block Inc. ( HRB.N ) said on Thursday it has contacted federal investigators about a possible conflict of interest involving dissident shareholder Richard Breeden, the former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission chairman who is seeking three board seats. 

 Breeden was appointed by the Justice Department in 2005 to monitor KPMG LLP's compliance with a $456 million settlement of a probe accusing it of setting up fraudulent tax shelters for wealthy clients. KPMG is also H&R Block's auditor, and the largest U.S. tax preparer said in a proxy statement that it asked U.S. Attorney Michael Garcia in Manhattan and the SEC's chief accountant to consider Breeden's relationship with KPMG. Kansas City, Missouri-based H&R Block is urging shareholders to approve KPMG's reappointment as auditor. In doing so, it warned that electing Breeden or his associates "would create a grave risk that KPMG would no longer be deemed to be independent." If that happened, H&R Block said it would need to find a new auditor, causing "great expense and disruption" and ultimately harming shareholders. Breeden rejected the company's contentions. "I am confident that H&R Block's shareholders will agree with me that the company's poor performance record under current management is of far greater concern than which accounting firm the company employs," he said. Breeden Capital Management LLC has said it controls 1.86 percent of H&R Block's shares. It has said H&R Block's share price has suffered because the company has strayed beyond tax preparation, losing money in such areas as subprime mortgage lending. H&R Block expects later this year to sell its Option One subprime lending unit to private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management for as much as $800 million. Yusill Scribner, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Michael Garcia, and SEC spokesman John Heine declined to comment. Breeden's special oversight of KPMG under the 2005 tax shelter agreement is scheduled to last through at least September 2008, prosecutors have said. H&R Block's annual meeting is scheduled for September 6. In afternoon trading, the company's shares were down 59 cents at $20.54 on the New York Stock Exchange. Through Wednesday, they had fallen 8 percent this year.
