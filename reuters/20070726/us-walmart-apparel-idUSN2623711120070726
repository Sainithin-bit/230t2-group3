 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - It's back-to-school season and that means it is time to see if Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s ( WMT.N ) efforts to revamp its apparel offering can muster a passing grade with shoppers. 

 The world's largest retailer has struggled with poor apparel sales after its efforts to compete with Target Corp. ( TGT.N ) and sell hipper clothes, like skinny jeans and velvet blazers, backfired with its shoppers, who were looking for basic, classic and affordable clothing. For the past year, Wal-Mart has been trying to fix its mistakes and has marked down unsold clothing, scaled back its trendy Metro 7 apparel line and said last week that Claire Watts, who oversaw its apparel merchandising, had resigned. Wal-Mart has said it hopes to show improvements during the back-to-school season. But it remains to be seen whether the retailer can entice shoppers back into its clothing aisles, or if they will head to rivals like Kohl's Corp. ( KSS.N ), J.C. Penney Co. Inc. ( JCP.N ) and Target to buy fashionable but affordable school clothes. "No one can beat (Wal-Mart) on price, but everyone is eating their lunch on fashion," said Patricia Edwards, a portfolio manager with Wentworth, Hauser and Violich that owns Wal-Mart shares. "If price is not that different and you get fashion for an extra $1 more, people will pay that dollar" and buy clothes at Wal-Mart's competitors, she said. STRUGGLES Last year, Wal-Mart downplayed its discount roots in hopes of convincing shoppers to buy higher-margin goods, like clothes or home goods, that could bolster slowing U.S. sales growth. It touted its George ME fashion line by guest designer Mark Eisen, and its own Metro 7 clothes that were designed "with the highly stylish, fashion-conscious customer in mind." But the success that Target has found pedaling cheap-chic clothes, like those by Isaac Mizrahi, was not easy to emulate, and Wal-Mart's core low-income shoppers did not warm to the new styles or higher prices. Wal-Mart has since admitted that it moved too far too fast. It is now following a "back-to-basics" strategy -- trying to stock items like T-shirts or shorts in a wide selection of colors and sizes that emphasize its low prices. But winning back-to-school clothing dollars may be tough. "One of the challenges at Wal-Mart has been how do you promote the cross-shopping behavior among customers?" said Craig Johnson, president of retail consulting firm Customer Growth Partners. Moms may buy toothpaste and toilet paper at Wal-Mart, but he said they often buy clothes at Kohl's or J.C. Penney, which have recently revitalized their apparel departments. He also noted that Wal-Mart has become an acceptable place for children and teenagers to buy electronics, but it does not have the same cachet when it comes to clothing. A kid will brag about a new tech gadget he got, Johnson said. "Nobody says: 'Hey! Look at these great denim jeans I got at Wal-Mart'." BACK ON TRACK Improving its apparel sales could help Wal-Mart jump-start same-store sales, a key retail gauge that measures sales at stores open at least a year. Last fiscal year, its U.S. same-stores sales rose at their lowest level since Wal-Mart began reporting such figures in 1980. This year, it has continued to struggle, with its April same-store sales falling 3.5 percent -- its largest ever publicly reported decline. Edwards said apparel and home sales account for 15 percent of Wal-Mart's revenue, so any improvement would be positive. She said Wal-Mart needs to work on striking a balance between selling the low-priced goods it is known for but adding fashionable touches shoppers want. Bernard Sosnick, a retail analyst at Oppenheimer, said a store visit last week showed Wal-Mart continues to struggle to get its apparel departments ready for back-to-school. "There were items that I'd seen on the racks several months ago still not marked for clearance, and these items and the items for clearance impeded the full transition to back-to-school and fall merchandise," he said. Sosnick said the announcement that Watts, who oversaw Wal-Mart's high-fashion forays, was resigning was a welcome change. Edwards said she is not betting that back-to-school will mark a definitive apparel turnaround for the retailer. Rather, she thinks the focus will fall on the holidays. "There's a lot of competition out there and Wal-Mart needs to sharpen their pencils and figure out how to compete, because the game has changed," Edwards said.
