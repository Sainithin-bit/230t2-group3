 TOKYO, July 26  (Reuters) - Sony Corp. ( 6758.T ) said its quarterly profit more than trebled after strong digital camera sales and a softer yen outstripped losses at its game unit, and it stood by its annual outlook, which is above market expectations.      Sony, which competes with Canon Inc. ( 7751.T ) in digital cameras and Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT.O ) and Nintendo Co. Ltd. 7974.OS in video games, earned an operating profit of 99.32 billion yen ($825.6 million) in April-June, up from 27.05 billion yen a year earlier.      This is a turnaround from an operating loss of 113.4 billion yen in the previous three months, when Sony booked losses at its once high-flying game unit.      Sony's PlayStation 3 game console has lagged Nintendo's Wii in monthly sales since their launches late last year due to the PS3's high price and scarcity of strong software titles.      But its Cyber-shot digital cameras met strong demand. The fiscal first quarter performance was also driven by a softer yen and a firmer stock market, which has boosted earnings at its financial division.      Sony kept unchanged its operating profit forecast of 440 billion yen for the year to March 2008. That is up sharply from 71.75 billion yen a year earlier, when the company was hit by hefty costs for launching the PS3, and compares with a consensus of 423.7 billion in a poll of 20 analysts by Reuters Estimates.      Shares in Sony gained 6 percent in the three months to June 30, underperforming the Tokyo stock market's electrical machinery index .IELEC.T, which rose 8 percent.
