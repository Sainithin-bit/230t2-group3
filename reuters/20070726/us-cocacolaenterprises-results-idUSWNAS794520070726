 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. ( CCE.N ) reported on Thursday that quarterly profit fell, hurt by falling North American demand for soft drinks and rising prices for aluminum for cans and corn syrup for sweetener. 

 The largest bottler of Coca-Cola Co ( KO.N ) drinks said profit was $270 million, or 56 cents per share, for the second quarter, compared with $339 million, or 71 cents per share, a year ago. Excluding restructuring charges and other items, profit was 58 cents per share for the company, which bottles, sells and distributes more than three-quarters of the Coke drinks sold in North America.
