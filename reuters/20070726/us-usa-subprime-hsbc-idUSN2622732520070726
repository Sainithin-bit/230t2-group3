 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A $9 billion wave of risky mortgages resetting at higher interest rates in the United States could force Europe's biggest bank, HSBC Holdings Plc ( HSBA.L ), to absorb another big hit to profits as more customers default. 

 Most of HSBC's reset activity, which increases the chances of defaults by triggering sharply higher monthly mortgage payments, will take place in the second half of the year. The London-based bank's HSBC Finance Corp. set aside $1.7 billion for loan losses in the first quarter, but that may not be enough, analysts say. HSBC reports interim results for the first half of the year on Monday. This month, U.S. lenders, including JPMorgan Chase & Co. ( JPM.N ) and Countrywide Financial Corp. CFC.N, revealed bigger-than-expected problems on loans that are considered a better risk than the ones held by HSBC. Both companies blamed their problems on the slumping U.S. housing market. HSBC's U.S. mortgage operations, which cater to a riskier clientele, may face deeper problems on about $9 billion in adjustable-rate mortgages. HSBC has tightened lending standards and made a number of management changes to minimize losses. The company also is reaching out to homeowners most likely to have problems with higher payments. HSBC and other lenders are modifying payment terms to offset a sharp rise in delinquencies and defaults. HSBC's first-quarter loss provision anticipated problems with the adjustable-rate mortgages, but problems in the risky subprime lending market have accelerated since then. "Given the continuing deterioration in this part of the mortgage market, we would not be surprised if further hefty provisions were needed in 2007, even though HSBC has tried to anticipate the effect of (adjustable-rate mortgage) resets," analysts at independent research firm CreditSights Inc. said. In May, HSBC Finance Chief Executive Brendan McDonagh said the rate of delinquencies had slowed. He later acknowledged to analysts on a conference call that not everything that will happen in the second half of the year can be reflected in the amount set aside in the first quarter for loan losses. A typical loan resetting these days is a so-called 2/28 loan, which entices borrowers with a low teaser rate. But after the two years, the interest rate is adjusted to a higher one. Before the housing market soured, homeowners refinanced or sold their homes to escape the reset to higher interest rates. Lenders have become tighter with their money as loans originated in 2005 began resetting this year. Sharply higher monthly mortgage payments are roiling household finances throughout the country. Payments can increase more than 50 percent, according to a March study of adjustable-rate mortgages by Christopher Cagan, head of research at First American CoreLogic Inc. Overall, trillions of dollars of adjustable-rate mortgages will have their payments begin to reset this year and next, he said. Cagan estimated about 1.1 million U.S. mortgages will be lost to foreclosure because of resets, triggering more than $325 billion in losses that will be spread into the next decade. While HSBC battles to minimize losses from resets, it faces another front with potential problems: home equity loans. Many of those loans are in a second-lien position to an adjustable-rate mortgage held by another lender. So if homeowners default on their underlying mortgages, HSBC is second in line to get its money, if anything is left. JPMorgan and Countrywide said losses on their home equity loans steepened because of falling housing prices. Problems were more acute on loans that required little money down from the borrower. In the most severe cases, banks are left holding first-lien loans that are greater than the value of the home. That's why HSBC executives are worried about their second-lien portfolio. A second-lien holder like HSBC doesn't have much leverage with customers who can't pay their first mortgage. "We're sitting behind a first (lien) that we have no control over," McDonagh said on the May conference call.
