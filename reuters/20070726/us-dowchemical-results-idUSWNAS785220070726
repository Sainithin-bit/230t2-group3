 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Dow Chemical Co. ( DOW.N ), the No. 1 U.S. chemical maker, said on Thursday its second-quarter earnings rose despite soaring energy costs, as strong volume growth in overseas markets offset weakness in the North American housing and automotive sectors. 

 Net income rose to $1.04 billion, or $1.07 a share, from $1.02 billion, or $1.05 a share, the Midland, Michigan-based company said. Analysts on average had forecast quarterly earnings of $1.05 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Dow has announced numerous joint ventures over the last few months in Libya, China, Brazil and Saudi Arabia, in an attempt to gain access to cheaper raw materials and overcome soaring energy costs. Shares of Dow have risen 2.4 percent over the last three months, but have underperformed a 7.5 percent increase in the Standard & Poor's Chemicals Index. (Reporting by  Euan Rocha )
