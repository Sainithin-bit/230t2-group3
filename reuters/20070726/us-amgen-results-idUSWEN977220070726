 NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Amgen Inc. on Thursday posted quarterly profit that topped Wall Street expectations, even as sales of its biggest drug, Aranesp, fell 19 percent in the United States amid safety concerns. 

 The company also announced positive breast cancer data about its most important experimental drug, denosumab, and issued a full-year profit forecast above analysts' estimates. Its shares rose 1.9 percent in after-hours trading. Amgen ( AMGN.O ), the world's largest biotechnology company by sales, posted a net profit of $1.02 billion, or 90 cents per share, compared with a net of $14 million, or 1 cent per share, a year earlier, when it took a large acquisition-related charge. Revenue increased a modest 3 percent in the quarter to $3.73 billion, just above Wall Street forecasts of $3.69 billion. But worldwide sales of the anemia drug Aranesp fell 10 percent to $949 million due to declining use in the United States. "This has been a difficult period and this quarter's low growth is a reflection of that reality," Chief Executive Kevin Sharer said in a statement. Excluding items, Amgen earned $1.12 per share, beating analysts' average forecast of $1.07 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Without a $1.1 billion charge, Amgen earned $1.05 a share in the year-ago quarter. "It looks like Amgen was pretty much in line with expectations, with the top-line (revenue) a little better than we expected," said A.G. Edwards analyst Al Rauch. "All in all, they executed well." ANEMIA DRUGS U.S. sales of Aranesp fell to $578 during from $713 million as doctors eliminated its use in some cases and used smaller doses. U.S. sales of its older anemia drug, Epogen, rose almost 2 percent to $624 million. U.S. health regulators in March ordered drug makers to place a "black box" warning -- the strongest possible -- on the red-blood cell boosting anemia drugs, encouraging doctors to use the lowest effective dose needed to avoid blood transfusions amid concerns that the drugs could increase the risk of heart attack and stroke. Another Aranesp study showed increased risk of death in cancer patients not undergoing chemotherapy. In May, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) announced plans to limit payments for the drugs. "Oncologists are now in a wait and see mode in advance of national coverage decisions," George Morrow, global commercial operations chief said on a conference call. Rauch said he does not expect sales of the company's anemia drugs to fall much farther. "Any changes will be minor from here because use of EPO drugs is well-established within the  medical community," Rauch said, including use in dialysis patients. Rauch said he believed many investors have overestimated the potential sales decline of the anemia drugs. "They are pricing in the worst-case scenario," he said. The company said the closely watched experimental drug denosumab met all primary and secondary goals in a late-stage, 252-patient breast cancer trial. The drug is seen as potentially filling a void in sales growth once projected for the company's existing products. It's being tested mainly as a treatment for osteoporosis and various forms of cancer, especially bone cancer. Rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel saw U.S. sales grow 13 percent to $777 million as overall sales hit $823 million. Combined global sales of the white blood cell boosters Neupogen and Neulasta rose 4 percent to $1.04 billion. Revenue from Vectibix, Amgen's new colon cancer drug, fell 12 percent from the prior quarter $45 million following unfavorable clinical trial results. Amgen said it now expects 2007 adjusted earnings, excluding items, of $4.28 per share, above analysts' average estimate of $4.19 per share for the year, according to Reuters estimates. It said it may yet revise that estimate depending on future anemia drug sales. Amgen shares rose to $57.20 in extended electronic trading from their Nasdaq close at $56.16.
