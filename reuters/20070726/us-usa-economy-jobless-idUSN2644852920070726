 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The number of new claims filed for U.S. jobless benefits fell unexpectedly in the latest week, dropping 2,000 to the lowest in more than two months, the government said on Thursday. 

 Initial jobless claims for state unemployment benefits fell for the third week, dropping to 301,000 for the week ended July 21 from an upwardly revised 303,000 the prior week and to the lowest level since May 12, the Labor Department said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast that initial claims would rise to 310,000 from the original reading of 301,000 in the week ended July 14. The four-week moving average, a more reliable gauge because it irons out most of the weekly fluctuations, fell to 308,500 from 312,500 the prior week. The number of workers remaining on benefit rolls after drawing an initial week of aid fell 19,000 to 2.55 million in the week ended July 14, the latest period for which figures were available. The drop was in line with economists' expectations.
