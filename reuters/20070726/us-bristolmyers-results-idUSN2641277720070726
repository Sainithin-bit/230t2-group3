 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. ( BMY.N ) on Thursday said quarterly earnings rose 6 percent on resumed growth for its blood-clot preventer, Plavix, and higher sales of other important drugs that offset anemic demand for older medicines. 

 The drugmaker slightly boosted its 2007 profit forecast and predicted 2008 profit would rise 17 percent to 18 percent. The company said it earned $706 million, or 36 cents per share, in the second quarter, compared with $667 million, or 34 cents per share, in the year-earlier period. Excluding special items, the New York-based drugmaker earned 37 cents per share. Analysts on average expected 36 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Bristol-Myers said sales rose 1 percent to $4.93 billion, in line with Wall Street expectations, but would have fallen 1 percent if not for favorable foreign exchange factors. The company forecast full-year, 2007 earnings, excluding special items, of $1.35 to $1.45 per share, from its earlier view of $1.30 to $1.40 per share. It said the earnings picture had improved because of cost controls and expected strong sales of several of its most important drugs. The new forecast translates into growth of 24 percent to 33 percent over last year, when profits tumbled after Canadian drugmaker Apotex Inc. briefly flooded the market with a generic form of Bristol's blockbuster Plavix before its sales were halted. But a New York federal judge in June upheld the patent on Plavix, sold in partnership with French drugmaker Sanofi-Aventis, thereby preventing Apotex from bringing its generic back to market. Second-quarter sales of Plavix rose 4 percent to $1.19 billion, as almost all remaining supplies of the cheaper Apotex generic were exhausted. For 2008, Bristol forecast earnings of $1.60 to $1.70 per share, based on a number of assumptions, including mid- to high-single-digit percentage revenue growth and only mid-single digit growth in research costs. The average Reuters Estimates forecast for next year is $1.61 per share. (Reporting by Ransdell Pierson)
