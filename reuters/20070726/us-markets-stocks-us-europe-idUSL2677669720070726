 LONDON  (Reuters) - Stock futures pointed to a drop in blue-chip shares and a rise in tech stocks on Thursday after upbeat earnings from Nasdaq heavyweights such as Apple Inc. ( AAPL.O ) and Qualcomm Inc. ( QCOM.O ) 

 Thursday's busy results calendar includes earnings from top oil producer Exxon Mobil Corp ( XOM.N ), conglomerate 3M ( MMM.N ), Amgen Inc. ( AMGN.O ), Bristol-Myers Squibb ( BMY.N ), Dow Chemical Co. ( DOW.N ) and Aetna Inc. ( AET.N ). By 0902 GMT (5:02 a.m. EDT) September Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.1 percent, while Standard & Poor's 500 and Dow Jones futures were both down 0.2 percent. Apple shares rose almost 8 percent to 107.27 euros in Frankfurt ( AAPL.F ) following a rally in extended trade on Wednesday after the iPod and iPhone maker's earnings beat expectations. The economic calendar includes weekly initial jobless claims, June durable goods orders and new home sales figures, which may offer more insight into the depth of the decline in the U.S. housing market. "Weekly job numbers may help to add some direction to the markets this afternoon ... along with durable goods and new home sales figures," said Claire Collingwood, a trader at CMC Markets. "We could well see the Dow test the broken support level of 13,800 over the next couple of days. The next level on the downside we should look out for is the psychological 13,700 area," she said. On Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 68.12 points, or 0.50 percent, to end at 13,785.07. The S&P was up 7.05 points, or 0.47 percent, at 1,518.09. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 8.31 points, or 0.31 percent, at 2,648.17. Apple shares were one of the biggest positive influences on the Nasdaq on Wednesday, and rose further in the wake of its results announcement after the close of regular trading. Further underpinning the tech sector on Thursday were sharp rises in shares of cell phone chipmaker Qualcomm, which also posted results on Wednesday. Qualcomm ( QCOM.O ) rose nearly 2 percent in electronic trade in New York, while software maker Symantec ( SYMC.O ) rose 9 percent. Symantec shares were the top percentage gainers among major U.S. and Canadian stocks traded in Europe, rising by nearly 9 percent to 15.69 euros in Frankfurt ( SYMC.F ). Qualcomm shares rose 2 percent in Frankfurt ( QCOM.F ) to 31.60 euros. Among decliners in Europe was drugs company Schering-Plough, whose shares fell by nearly 4 percent to 22.00 euros in Frankfurt ( SGP.F ).
