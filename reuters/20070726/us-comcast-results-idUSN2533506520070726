 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Comcast Corp. ( CMCSA.O ) posted a 28 percent rise in quarterly profit on Thursday, but its shares fell nearly 7 percent as it lost more subscribers than expected, amid concerns that the weak housing market could hurt growth. 

 Although the leading U.S. cable operator's profit and revenue was in line with expectations, it lost 95,000 basic video subscribers in the second quarter -- a bigger loss than the 20,000 forecast by Bear Stearns or the 12,000 estimated by Sanford Bernstein. The subscriber loss reduces Comcast's subscriber base to 24.1 million from 24.2 million. While Comcast usually loses some customers in the second quarter as university students terminate their contracts at the end of the school year, Sanford Bernstein analyst Craig Moffett said the quarter could also have been hurt by a weaker housing market. "The weak housing market is undoubtedly putting a damper on the growth rate for the entire pay-TV industry," he said. Comcast, the largest U.S. pay-TV provider, had lost 91,000 basic video subscribers in the second quarter of 2006. Analysts had expected subscriber losses in the latest quarter to be offset this quarter by subscriber gains and retention spurred by its competitively priced 'triple play' bundling of video, phone and Internet. Comcast shares dropped nearly 7 percent amid a stock market downturn following weaker-than-expected new U.S. house sales in June. Time Warner Cable Inc. ( TWC.N ) shares fell by 6.3 percent while Cablevision Systems Corp. ( CVC.N ) fell by over 3 percent. Comcast said net profit rose to $588 million, or 19 cents per share, in the second quarter, up from $460 million, or 15 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 31 percent to $7.712 billion, driven by a rapid uptake of digital television and phone subscribers. Thomas Eagan, an analyst at Oppenheimer, said Comcast had benefited from its focus on digital TV and digital phone customers, and described the results as "largely positive." Comcast backed its 2007 outlook on factors including revenue and capital spending to reassure investors that it will not be increasing its spending in the second half of the year after posting a 52 percent jump in capital expenditures?? to $1.6 billion during the second quarter. Chief Executive Brian Roberts said in a statement, "We see cable growth accelerating in the second half of 2007." The company is leading the charge by U.S. cable operators to win subscribers from telephone companies by aggressively marketing its bundled television, high-speed Internet and phone services. Comcast added 823,OOO digital video subscribers in the second quarter as it aggressively introduced digital TV set-top boxes to beat a U.S. regulator deadline of July 1, after which it has had to introduce a new stock of CableCARD-enabled set-top boxes. The CableCARD was mandated by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission to make it easier for consumers to more easily change cable providers. The drive by Comcast saw a 52 percent rise in capital expenditure during the quarter. Comcast's high-speed Internet subscribers grew by 330,000, compared to 333,000 additions last year. Bear Stearns' Wang had forecast net additions of 729,000 digital video subscribers and 390,000 Internet subscribers. The Philadelphia-based cable company also added 554,000 phone subscribers, versus Wang's forecast of 516,000. Average monthly revenue per video subscriber rose to $101.02 the first time it had broken the $100-mark. Comcast shares fell 6.6 percent to $26.66 in mid-day trade on the Nasdaq.
