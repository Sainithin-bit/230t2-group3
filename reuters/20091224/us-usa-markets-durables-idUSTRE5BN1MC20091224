 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The number of workers filing new applications for jobless benefits fell last week to the lowest level in more than 15 months, according to government data on Thursday. 

 New orders for long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods rose less than expected in November, held back by a drop in civilian aircraft orders, but surged after excluding transportation, a government report showed on Thursday. KEY POINTS: DURABLES * The Commerce Department said durable goods orders rose 0.2 percent after falling by an unrevised 0.6 percent in October. * Analysts polled by Reuters forecast orders rising 0.5 percent last month. COMMENTS: ROBERT DYE, SENIOR ECONOMIST, PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES, PITTSBURGH: JOBLESS CLAIMS: "It's another good number after creeping up last week. The downward trend continues. All evidence point to the healing in the labor market. I would not be surprise to see a positive net payroll number in December. That would be the first time in about two years." DURABLE GOODS: "What we are seeing in manufacturing is a rebound in the auto sector. Auto production is ramping up. We see a rejuvenation in auto spreading. "Boeing's Dreamliner will also have a long-term positive impact on manufacturing. "Both of these series (durables and jobless claims) point to ongoing healing in the economy. They are all pointing to a better-than-expected GDP in the fourth quarter, likely in the 3.5 percent to 4.0 percent range. They are consistent with a forecast moderate recovery through 2010." DAN GREENHAUS, ANALYST, MILLER TABAK & CO., NEW YORK: "The jobless claims number was better than expected, and its good news though there's a lot of seasonal issues that come into play in December. That adds to volatility. We should have a better picture of the jobless claims issue in January. "More importantly, the durable goods order excluding aircraft was very healthy. Since that's our proxy for business spending, its encouraging to see it rise."
