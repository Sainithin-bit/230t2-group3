 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The number of workers filing new applications for jobless benefits fell last week to the lowest level in more than 15 months, according to government data on Thursday. 

 New orders for long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods rose less than expected in November, held back by a drop in civilian aircraft orders, but surged after excluding transportation, a government report showed on Thursday. KEY POINTS: DURABLES * The Commerce Department said durable goods orders rose 0.2 percent after falling by an unrevised 0.6 percent in October. * Analysts polled by Reuters forecast orders rising 0.5 percent last month. COMMENTS: KEN MAYLAND, PRESIDENT, CLEARVIEW ECONOMICS LLC, PEPPER PIKE, OHIO: DURABLE GOODS: "The details are reading better than the headline. Excluding transportation, companies look like they are re-ordering to replenish depleted inventories. It also looks like they are ordering to meet rising demand. "Manufacturing is participating in this recovery after it fell harder than the rest of economy during the down phase. "It seems pretty much a sure thing that we are going to have better growth in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter. I'm settling in a number in the 3.5 percent area. MARC PADO, U.S. MARKET STRATEGIST, CANTOR FITZGERALD & CO., SAN FRANCISCO: "The numbers were great -- 452,000 weekly claims is the lowest of the year -- continuing that trend down. It's critical, 500,000 is generally seen as zero jobs, so breaking below that level and staying below that level for the month of December, we might even see some job growth when we get that December jobs number and that is obviously a real plus to market sentiment. "As far as the durable goods, I know the headline number was a little light but that ex-transportation number, not only up 2 percent -- they were looking for up 1 percent. So this is a great number on top of an upwardly revised number. When you take out the transportation -- durables are a volatile number anyway. Good way to end before the holidays." TOM PORCELLI, SENIOR ECONOMIST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, NEW YORK: "The durables numbers were definitely very strong. It's not enough just to look at what headline durables did and what durables ex trans did. In my mind that's not giving you a very well rounded picture. "Look at what we call the core number: That is capital goods non-defense, excluding aircraft. When you look at those in both the new orders and the shipments category they were very strong. The shipments were what most people were expecting for the cap-ex.
