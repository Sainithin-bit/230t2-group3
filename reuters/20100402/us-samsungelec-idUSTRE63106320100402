 SEOUL  (Reuters) - Shares in Samsung Electronics ( 005930.KS ) hit a record high on Friday fueled by foreign buying amid current strong memory chip momentum and a robust earnings outlook for the first half. 

 Shares in the world's No. 1 memory chip maker rose 0.71 percent to 851,000 won, hitting a historical high. Samsung Electronics said earlier last month that it was targeting a higher operating profit and double-digit growth in sales in 2010, fueled by strong demand for its flat screens and memory chips. Samsung is also expected to post more than 4 trillion won ($3.5 billion) in operating profit from its semiconductor business in the first half, according to a local media report earlier this week.
