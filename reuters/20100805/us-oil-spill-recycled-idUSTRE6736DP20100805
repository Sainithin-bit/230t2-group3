 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - Most of the oil spilled in the Gulf of Mexico has evaporated, sunk to the seabottom or been collected and disposed of, the U.S. government said on Wednesday, but some could end up in U.S. drivers' gas tanks. 

 Some 585,000 barrels recovered by various means at the site of BP Plc.'s blown-out Macondo well has been hauled ashore in tankers and could be cleaned up, refined and sold as gasoline or diesel fuel. "Gasoline is gasoline," said refining consultant John Auers of Turner Mason & Co. "It really doesn't matter what crude it came from." Most of the 4.9 million barrels spilled after BP's well blew out April 20 is gone, a U.S. report said Wednesday. But oil captured at the wellhead during the battle to close off the flow could reappear at U.S. neighborhood gasoline stations, BP branded or not, experts said. The 585,000 barrels of oil would sell for about $50 million at recent U.S. benchmark prices, but the actual recovered volumes would sell at a steep discount, traders said. Depending on its condition, it could be categorized as recovered or as slops, a far cry from the industry standard for U.S. refiners. Slops is the somewhat derogatory term for the small amount of substandard products or oil contaminated during processing that refiners regularly reprocess, experts said. BP's recovered oil is better than most slop, but it still would be sold at a discount due to the circumstances, so it could theoretically be profitable to refine, experts said. "I'd consider it 'recovered oil,' not 'slops,'" said Stephen Jones of Purvin & Gertz consultants. BP has sold some of the oil and kept some but has not released details of where it all went "for proprietary reasons," said company spokesman Daren Beaudo. Other refiners have not acknowledged buying any, and experts said the small amount, less than two days' supply at many plants, could be more trouble than it is worth. "I've heard a lot of refiners don't even want to fool with it," refining consultant Auers said, Auers guessed BP is more likely to refine the stuff itself, saving the cost of the discount. "It's going to get mixed and lost in the stream of oil," said Mark Cooper, research director for the Consumer Federation of America. Consumers need not worry whether it's safe to use, said John Kleine, director of the BP Amoco Marketers Association. "It's going to be tested and validated all the way from the point of entry at the refinery to the point of exit into your tank," Kleine said. (Reporting by Bruce Nichols; Editing by  David Gregorio )
