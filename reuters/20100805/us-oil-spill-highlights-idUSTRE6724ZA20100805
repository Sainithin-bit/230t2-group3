 (Reuters) - Here are some developments in BP Plc's Gulf of Mexico oil spill, the largest offshore oil disaster in U.S. history. 

 TOP DEVELOPMENTS * BP pumped cement down its blown-out Gulf of Mexico well on Thursday, sealing it off and setting up a planned permanent kill later this month of the source of the world's worst marine spill. MARKET IMPACT/COMPANIES * Independent oil and gas company Plains Exploration & Production Co plans to sell its assets in the Gulf of Mexico and expand onshore, due to the regulatory backlash over the BP oil spill. * Transocean Ltd reassured investors on Thursday that BP would bear most of the liability linked to the Gulf of Mexico well blow-out and resulting oil spill disaster. * A group of investors including the two largest U.S. public pension funds asked 27 top oil and gas companies on Thursday to disclose what they have done to make their offshore drilling safer in the wake of the BP oil spill. * Reflecting hopes that an end to the 108-day-old drama is now in sight, BP shares hit two-month highs in early trading in London. They later fell back, closing up 0.42 percent. BP shares closed up 3.3 percent in New York. POLITICS/POLICY * Mexico's state oil company Pemex will delay its Maximino exploration oil well until next year due to concerns about deepwater drilling in the wake of the BP Plc oil spill, a top regulator said on Thursday. * The White House said on Wednesday it owed no apology to former BP chief executive Tony Hayward, after welcoming a report that showed pollution from the Gulf oil spill was less than many initially had feared. CAPTURE/CONTAINMENT/CLEANUP * Most of the oil spilled in the Gulf of Mexico has evaporated, sunk to the seabottom or been collected and disposed of, the U.S. government said on Wednesday, but some could end up in U.S. drivers' gas tanks. * Nearly three-fourths of oil from the BP spill is gone from the Gulf of Mexico, with 26 percent remaining as a sheen or tarballs, buried in sediment or washed ashore, U.S. scientists said on Wednesday. ENVIRONMENT * With most of a once-massive Gulf of Mexico oil slick no longer a threat, environmental experts say the Gulf coast may have dodged the worst nightmare of a massive catastrophe. * Gulf of Mexico shrimpers and fishermen, whose livelihoods have been imperiled by the BP oil spill, can go back to work as soon as tests show there is no risk of contamination, a top U.S. official said on Wednesday.
