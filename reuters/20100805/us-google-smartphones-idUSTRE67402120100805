 LAKE TAHOE, California  (Reuters) - About 200,000 smartphones based on Google's ( GOOG.O ) Android operating system are sold every day, CEO Eric Schmidt said on Wednesday, underscoring the strong challenge to rivals like Apple's ( AAPL.O ) iPhone. 

 Schmidt told reporters on the sidelines of an industry conference in Lake Tahoe that Android -- a mobile software launched just over a year ago -- was gaining momentum in a fiercely competitive tech arena. Smartphones running the fledgling software topped the list among U.S. consumers in the second quarter, industry tracker NPD said on Wednesday. The operating system powered a third of all smartphones sold from April to June, with Research in Motion's RIM.TO RIMM.O BlackBerry sliding to second place for the first time since 2007. BlackBerry lost 9 percentage points of market share, diving to 28 percent. The iPhone came in third with 22 percent. Android is now on smartphones made by a number of different manufacturers, including a revitalized Motorola's MOT.N Droid -- the best-selling Android handset in the second quarter among U.S. consumers -- and Taiwan's HTC ( 2498.TW ). Google said recently that 160,000 Android phones had been activated each day during the second quarter, up from 65,000 in the first quarter. (Reporting by  Alexei Oreskovic )
