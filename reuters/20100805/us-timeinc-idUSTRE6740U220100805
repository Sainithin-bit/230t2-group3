 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Time Warner Inc is expected to name former Meredith Corp executive Jack Griffin as chief executive of its publishing arm, Time Inc, the New York Times reported. 

 Griffin will replace Ann Moore, who is expected to remain as chairwoman, the paper said, citing executives at both companies. The announcement was scheduled for Monday next week, the paper added. Time Inc publications include Time, Sports Illustrated and People. Earlier this week, Meredith said Jack Griffin had chosen to leave the company to pursue another opportunity. Griffin was the president of its National Media Group unit, which publishes magazines like Family Circle, Better Homes and Gardens. Time Inc could not be immediately reached for comment by Reuters outside of normal U.S. business hours. (Reporting by Jennifer Robin Raj in Bangalore; editing by Elaine Hardcastle)
