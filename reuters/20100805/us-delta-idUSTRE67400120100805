 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc's $1.2 billion renovation of its terminals at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport is expected to be approved on Thursday, a source familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. 

 The board of the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey will vote on the project on Thursday, the source said. A Port Authority representative confirmed there will be a Delta project before the board on Thursday. "Delta has been working closely with the Port to develop a plan for our JFK Terminal, one that reflects the significant investments we've been making in the New York market over the past several years," Delta spokeswoman Heather Faulkner said in a statement. Delta has made no secret of its desire to improve operations at JFK, calling the New York airport "its worst facility" during a June investor conference. Company executives told analysts on Delta's earnings conference call last month that the carrier was working on "resolving its facility issues at JFK" and hoped "to have an announcement in that regard shortly."
