 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - BP Plc said on Thursday it had begun pumping cement into its blown-out Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico to begin killing the leak for good. 

 "The aim of the procedure is to assist with the strategy to kill and isolate the well," BP said in a statement. "This procedure will complement the ongoing relief well operation." (Reporting by Kristen Hays, editing by Vicki Allen)
