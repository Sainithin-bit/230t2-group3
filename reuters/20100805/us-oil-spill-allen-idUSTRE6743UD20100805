 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - BP Plc will continue pumping cement into its blown-out Macondo well through Friday, the U.S. official in charge of the spill response said on Thursday. 

 "This is not the end, but it will virtually assure us that no oil will be leaking into the environment," retired Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen said a briefing in Washington. (Reporting by Kristen Hays in Houston)
