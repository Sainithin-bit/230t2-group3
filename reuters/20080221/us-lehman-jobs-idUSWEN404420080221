 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEH.N is cutting 200 jobs, equivalent to 10 percent of its investment banking staff, CNBC television reported on Thursday. 

 If the report is true, the firings would be the latest sign that Wall Street banks are trimming payrolls amid write-downs on loans as well as a slowdown in mergers. Lehman spokesman Brian Finnegan declined to comment. As of November 30, 2007, Lehman Brothers employed approximately 28,600 people. (Reporting by  Christian Plumb )
