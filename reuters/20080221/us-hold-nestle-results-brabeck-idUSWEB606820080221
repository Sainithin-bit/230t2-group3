 VEVEY, Switzerland  (Reuters) - Nestle ( NESN.VX ) CEO Peter Brabeck will not commit to match the pace of organic growth in 2008 after 7.4 percent in 2007 even as price pressures on commodities are expected to wane later in the year. 

 "I am not saying we are going to match the same growth rate (as in 2007)," Brabeck told Reuters in an interview. "We are committing to the 5-6 growth rate." Brabeck that he saw continued global economic growth in 2008 supporting Nestle's business, especially in emerging markets. "In general, 2008 will be another year of global growth. There will be important growth in 2008," he said. "I am a little bit optimistic." The company aimed to cut costs by 1.3 billion Swiss francs ($1.19 billion) in 2008 after cutting by 1.5 billion in 2007, he said, after the group posted a 15.8 percent leap in 2007 net profit, higher than expected, and detailed plans to push into emerging markets. Premium products such as Nespresso coffee would also drive growth, he said. "The luxury and premium market in our business will continue to outgrow the average growth of the market," he said. "I don't think that this part is going to have less growth than it did last year." Brabeck said he expected recent record increases in commodity prices to cool off in 2008. "It is forecast that the raw materials prices are flattening out in 2008. My best guess is that in the second half, the raw materials prices will come down," he said. Brabeck also said he was sanguine about threats earlier this month by Venezuela to expropriate dairy plants belonging to Nestle and Italy's Parmalat ( PLT.MI ). "I am not too worried," he said, adding that Nestle has proved that it could play a positive role in the milk market there. The Swiss-based maker of Kitkat chocolate bars and Nescafe coffee exceeded analyst expectations with a 16 percent net profit rise and a 9 percent jump in sales in 2007.
