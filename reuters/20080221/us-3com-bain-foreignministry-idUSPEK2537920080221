 BEIJING  (Reuters) - China called on Thursday for the United States to treat Chinese companies "fairly", after security worries nixed the sale of a network equipment maker to China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd HWT.UL and Bain Capital Partners. 

 The two firms withdrew their application for U.S. security approval of a $2.2 billion purchase of 3Com Corp COMS.O, having failed to satisfy the concerns of a U.S. government panel. While the companies said they were still in discussions and the proposed transaction had not yet been terminated, a source familiar with the situation said the failure kills the deal in its current form. China said its firms deserved better treatment. "This was a normal business investment in accordance with market rules. It was an investment decision made in accordance with (Huawei's) own development," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao told a regular news conference. "We hope relevant U.S. management departments can deal with this issue fairly and in accordance with the law, to create a fair and favorable environment for Chinese companies in the United States," he added. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) had raised concerns about the deal, through which Huawei -- China's top telecom equipment maker -- would have initially owned as much as 16.5 percent of 3Com, whose Tipping Point unit makes national security software. The panel, led by the U.S. Treasury Secretary, reviews corporate acquisitions involving foreign buyers. Ren Zhengfei, a former People's Liberation Army soldier, founded Huawei in 1988. The firm has always maintained it is a private company and wholly owned by its employees. In October, eight U.S. lawmakers had backed a bill suggesting the planned buyout of 3Com "threatens the national security of the United States". Although Congress has no direct role in CFIUS reviews, the panel is still smarting from a storm of criticism two years ago when it approved state-owned Dubai Ports World's acquisition of several U.S. port operations. Congress was so enraged by the approval that it enacted a tougher law requiring CFIUS to spend more time vetting deals and to keep lawmakers better informed. Dubai Ports later relinquished the port operations it had purchased amid the political pressure. (Reporting by  Ben Blanchard ; Editing by  Ken Wills  and  Jerry Norton )
