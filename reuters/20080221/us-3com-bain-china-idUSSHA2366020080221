 WASHINGTON/SHANGHAI  (Reuters) - Bain Capital Partners and China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's HWT.UL failure to win U.S. national security approval for their $2.2 billion acquisition of U.S. network equipment maker 3Com Corp COMS.O may deter Chinese companies from considering similar investments. 

 Bain and 3Com announced on Wednesday they were pulling their application after failing to satisfy the concerns of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a panel led by the U.S. Treasury Secretary that reviews corporate acquisitions involving foreign buyers. Huawei, China's top telecoms equipment maker, would have owned as much as 21.5 percent of 3Com. "Congress is going to take a strong interest in any investment by a Chinese company that involves a national security industry or critical infrastructure industry," said George Grammas, a lawyer at Squire, Sanders & Dempsey, whose clients have included Chinese companies. "I would characterize this as Congress sending a strong message to investors from China," Grammas added. He said this could scare away Chinese investors from some deals. For those willing to proceed to a CFIUS review, "this message informs them that they need to develop a strategy" to privately lobby lawmakers early in the process, Grammas added. In the case of privately-owned Huawei, a lack of lobbying prowess and what critics saw as a lack of transparency were partly responsible for sinking the deal, analysts said. "Chinese companies need to get a better understanding of how they're perceived in the United States -- they need to understand the political process and the whole role of lobbying," said Shaun Rein, managing director of China Market Research Group. Although the stake would not have come with operational control or decision-making power, several U.S. lawmakers complained the deal threatened national security because of Huawei's alleged ties to the Chinese military. Despite winning deals with top-tier carriers -- such as Deutsche Telekom's ( DTEGn.DE ) T-Mobile and Vodafone ( VOD.L ) -- Huawei remains hampered by founder Ren Zhengfei's background as a former People's Liberation Army soldier. Ren founded Huawei in 1988, but the firm has maintained it is a private company and wholly owned by its employees. "There are certain sectors that perhaps foreign entities in general just shouldn't invest in when they're not moving into countries that are their closest allies," added Rein. CONCESSIONS According to a source familiar with the situation, Bain had offered various concessions, including one proposal to divest a 3Com unit that makes national security software. That apparently was not enough for CFIUS, and another source said the deal would not be able to proceed under its current structure. Although Congress has no direct role in CFIUS reviews, the panel -- which includes representatives from the departments of Commerce, Defense, Justice and State -- is still smarting from a storm of criticism two years ago when it approved state-owned Dubai Ports World's acquisition of several U.S. port operations. Congress was so enraged by the approval that it enacted a tougher law requiring CFIUS to spend more time vetting deals and to keep lawmakers better informed. Dubai Ports, under political pressure, later relinquished the port operations it had bought. The Bain-3Com transaction was more heavily scrutinized than recent deals involving sovereign wealth funds, including China's, which have spent billions of dollars on minority stakes in some big banks hurt by the subprime mortgage crisis. Purchasing minority stakes in non-sensitive sectors might be a better route for Chinese companies hoping to invest in the United States, said Edward Yu, president of Beijing-based research firm Analysys International. "Being low-key is the focus. It may be better to attack from the side instead of going for direct engagement," he said. The top lawmakers on the Senate Banking Committee, Democrat Christopher Dodd and Republican Richard Shelby, said the Bain-3Com case showed that the new, tougher CFIUS process was working as intended to protect national security. "The process functions as Congress intended," added Todd Malan, head of the Organisation for International Investment. Malan, whose group represents foreign companies, said the case should demonstrate to critics that CFIUS is not toothless. In the longer term, China may throw up tit-for-tat trade barriers if the United States repeatedly denies it the chance to make high-profile investments, China-based analysts say. "Do you want Chinese companies pursuing more protectionist strategies and saying 'we're never going to make it in the international market'?" asked Duncan Clark, chairman of Beijing-based investment advisory firm BDA. "This all makes the U.S. much less attractive for foreign direct investment -- and the ultimate cost is on the U.S.'s head," he said.
