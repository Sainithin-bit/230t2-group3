 VEVEY, Switzerland  (Reuters) - Nestle ( NESN.VX ) does not expect coffee and cocoa prices to climb further from their already high levels, Chief Executive Peter Brabeck said on Thursday. 

 "Coffee prices are today, according to our judgment, at the high end of the price level," Brabeck told a news conference following the release of Nestle's 2007 annual results, which exceeded market expectations. "When I look at coffee and cocoa, those prices should come down rather than go up," he said. Brabeck said the involvement of hedge funds in commodities had skewed coffee markets, making it difficult to forecast prices. "This brings an increased volatility and it brings an increased speculative aspect which is more difficult to judge," he said, adding that such speculation should only have short-term impacts. "The fundamentals for coffee are good. I think the market will bring the prices for coffee rather slightly down than substantially up."
