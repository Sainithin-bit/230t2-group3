 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oil investor T. Boone Pickens said on Thursday he has a short position on oil and natural gas due to his expectation that prices will fall in the near-term. 

 Pickens, speaking on CNBC television, said he expects the price of oil to fall $10 a barrel to $15 a barrel in the second quarter from the $100 level it hit on the U.S. market this week. But he said he expects the price of oil to be back above $100 a barrel in the second half of year. He also called natural gas prices unusually high and said he expects them to "back off also." Investors who sell securities "short" profit from betting stock or commodity prices will fall. Short-sellers borrow securities and then sell them, waiting for the asset price to fall so they can buy the asset back at the lower price, return them to the lender and pocket the difference.
