 (Reuters) - Gold and platinum roared to record highs 
on Thursday, as investors poured fresh money into commodities 
following record high oil prices and dollar weakness. 

 Oil surged to a record over $101 a barrel on a gush of hedge 
fund inflows and OPEC supply concerns, with traders weighing 
U.S. economic worries against expectations of further rate cuts. Other commodities to hit record highs this week are 
Malaysian palm oil, U.S. soybeans, European gas oil, European 
gasoline barges, U.S. heating oil and U.S. RBOB gasoline. The following is a list of record highs for commodities. All
crude oil futures highs are taken from front month continuation
