 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A New York state appeals court has given Maurice "Hank" Greenberg, the ex-CEO of American International Group Inc ( AIG.N ) access to internal company documents that provide details of questionable transactions, according to a New York Times article on Thursday. 

 Greenberg, who was forced out of AIG in 2005 after accusations of improper accounting, has denied any wrongdoing and has said that the documents would help clear his name, according to the article. An AIG spokesman confirmed the court decision and said the company would appeal it. The transactions in question led to a costly restatement and settlement with regulators.
