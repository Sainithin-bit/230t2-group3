 BOSTON  (Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp ( IBM.N ) expects sales in developing countries such as Brazil, Russia, India and China to continue to grow at a healthy clip for at least another six months, said Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge. 

 The world's largest technology services company has seen sales in those countries and other emerging markets climb far faster than in the United States, Western Europe and other developed economies in recent years. Loughridge said in an interview on Thursday that he expects the trend to continue as governments, public agencies and large corporations hire IBM to help them with projects to modernize infrastructure such as telecommunications, banking and transportation systems. "If we look at the headlights, we have our strongest headlights extending about six months into the future. We see very strong opportunities here," he said. "There are big opportunities for the roll-out of these infrastructure projects." For the third quarter ended Sept 30, IBM reported a 51 percent surge in revenue in Russia, a 28 percent jump in Brazil and a 24 percent spike in India. Overall sales rose 13 percent in emerging markets during the quarter. That compares with revenue gains of just 1 percent in the United States, 10 percent in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, and 6 percent in Asia. Loughridge said that revenue only climbed 3 percent during the quarter in China, but he attributed the slow growth to the Olympic Games, saying business in the country slowed down in August as the country tuned in to the Games. "China ... was very strong at the beginning of quarter. (There was a) pause during the Olympics. We expect that will come back in Q4," he said. (Editing by  Richard Chang )
