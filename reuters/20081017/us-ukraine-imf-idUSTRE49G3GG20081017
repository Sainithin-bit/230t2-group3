 KIEV  (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund is prepared to give Ukraine up to $14 billion to help stabilize the country's financial system, a senior Ukrainian official said on Friday, as it sought to cool nerves over its debt and currency. 

 IMF officials met the country's leaders on Friday and an adviser to the ex-Soviet state's president said two to three weeks were needed to clinch an agreement on a credit facility. Other countries, like Hungary Iceland and Serbia, are also seeking help to find remedies to jolts sustained from the world financial crisis. Ukraine's approach is complicated by divisions in its leadership after a government break-up. Oleksander Shlapak, deputy head of President Viktor Yushchenko's secretariat, said Ukraine first had to work out with the IMF the criteria to qualify for such a credit. "The mission is only studying the situation and in the course of a week -- Tuesday or Wednesday -- can propose a list of demands on the basis of which we can talk about a credit," Shlapak told a news conference. "I see the situation like this -- in the next two-three weeks, we could come to a joint agreement with the IMF mission." Shlapak said Ukraine would be entitled to a credit of about $10-14 billion on the basis of its quotas in the Fund. Parliament chairman Arseniy Yatsenyuk, in an internet account of his talks with the IMF, said Ukraine plans to nationalize banks in trouble "to save the banking system." Though Yatsenyuk is a former first deputy chairman of the central bank, he is not a policy maker. The political process to move to nationalization could become subject to wrangling between Yushchenko and Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko. The central bank has already talked of nationalizing the country's sixth largest bank, Prominvest, now in receivership. In his comments to the mission, Yushchenko said it was important to "assess the risks with a single voice. The second part, when we try to answer how to overcome these challenges, must be relevant and professional." RATINGS DOWNGRADE As the mission proceeded, ratings agency Fitch downgraded Ukraine's credit rating to B+ from BB-. The cost of insuring Ukraine's debt against restructuring or default rose sharply on Friday to a mid-price of 2,000 basis points -- meaning it costs $2 million a year over five years to insure $10 million of debt. Ratings agency Standard & Poor's put Ukraine's B+ rating on review for possible downgrade on Wednesday, while Moody's B1 rating is on positive outlook. Analysts are concerned about the weakness of the hryvnia currency and the stability of banks. At least one on Friday said an IMF credit, though welcome, masked structural problems. "The current account is widening massively, the economic situation is still one of high inflation, the political situation looks paralyzed," said Michael Ganske, head of emerging markets research at Commerzbank. "You would expect a ratings downgrade and there will probably be another downgrade." Ukraine remained embroiled in the latest episode of its long-running political crisis pitting the president against the prime minister. The two allies from the pro-Western "Orange Revolution" of 2004 are now openly hostile to each other. Tymoshenko on Thursday said any IMF credit was contingent on postponement of an early election called by the president. The Fund denied it had made any such link. The mission earlier on Friday met Tymoshenko and its head, Ceyla Pazarbasioglu, was quoted as telling the prime minister the Fund was "ready to provide help to IMF member-states." "We are working very hard and are prepared to do everything within our power to help you in working out economic policy," Interfax news agency quoted Pazarbasioglu as saying. A government spokeswoman confirmed Pazarbasioglu had made the comments during the meeting. Ukraine faces its third election in as many years on Dec 7 after Yushchenko accused Tymoshenko of breaking up the governing coalition and dissolved parliament. Tymoshenko denounces an election as "reckless" and her allies have launched court action to stop it. Election officials say it would now be difficult to keep to the election timetable.
