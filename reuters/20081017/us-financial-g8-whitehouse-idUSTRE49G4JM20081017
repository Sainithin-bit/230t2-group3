 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The White House said on Friday it did not expect a date to be set for a Group of Eight gathering when President George W. Bush meets with French President Nicolas Sarkozy and European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso on Saturday. 

 "I don't believe that tomorrow night's meeting will have any new policy announcements or any decision on a date or a location for that meeting although everybody is working toward that," White House spokeswoman Dana Perino told reporters. "I think a date for a meeting is a little bit less important than figuring out what recommendations people want to come to the table with," she said.
