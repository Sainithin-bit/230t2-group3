 SEOUL  (Reuters) - South Korean authorities pledged action on Friday to stabilize local markets, hammered by the global financial storm and threatening to drag down already weakening economic growth. 

 Media reports said the steps, to be announced on Sunday at 1 a.m. EDT, could include extra funding for local banks which are struggling to find international banks willing to lend them dollars to roll over large foreign currency loans. Finance Minister Kang Man-soo, speaking after an emergency meeting of top financial officials on how to handle the volatility that has knocked local markets to their lowest levels in a decade, said the measures would be "pre-emptive, decisive and sufficient." South Korea, whose financial institutions have already faced two crises in the past decade, has looked especially vulnerable to the current global credit squeeze because of the high level of foreign debt held by its banks even though it has the world's sixth-largest currency reserves at around $240 billion. The economy fell to the edge of collapse during the 1997/98 Asian financial crisis and banks were battered again in 2002 by a consumer credit bubble which became a long-term drag on domestic spending. In another day of wild trading in the won, the currency rebounded from its biggest loss in 11 years on Thursday, supported by a jump in U.S. markets overnight. The won, the worst-performing currency this year in Asia that are monitored by Reuters News, ended local trade up nearly 3 percent at 1,333.8/5.2 to the dollar, though a long way from recouping Thursday's almost 10 percent fall. UNCERTAINTY But the main KOSPI share index, which had opened higher, ended the day 2.73 percent lower at 1,180.67 points, its lowest close since late October. "What is happening now in equity markets is that we are seeing the reality of an oncoming recession, coming into weakening earnings estimates and thus for share prices for very cyclical stocks," said Michael Gordon, global head of Fidelity's institutional investments. Adding to the gloom, Morgan Stanley downgraded South Korea shares to underweight, saying its economy does not appear to have the strength to offset an export downturn. "Even more importantly, the banking sector in (South) Korea is proving more vulnerable than key North Asian peers (China and Taiwan) to the credit crunch due to its reliance on interbank fundings," the investment bank said in a report. Yonhap news agency said the government was considering providing a guarantee on existing and new borrowings by the country's dollar-starved banks. But in another sign of how the global crisis is sapping confidence in Asia's fourth-largest economy, central bank figures showed the ratio of business start-ups to failures in September fell a two-year low of 26.2. Moves in South Korea's financial markets have been more dramatic than others in the region on concerns about its high level of external debt, which ratings agency Moody's Investors Services estimates at nearly 40 percent of GDP. Standard & Poor's this week put seven South Korean financial institutions on negative watch, citing foreign currency funding pressures. "A lot of jittery foreign investors are literally taking flight from the domestic banking sector," said Suh Young-soo, a senior analyst at Kiwoom.Com Securities. However, S&P affirmed its sovereign ratings on the country. "The sovereign credit ratings on Korea are supported by its dynamic economy, sound fiscal position, and sound external position," said Standard & Poor's credit analyst Kim Eng Tan [ID:nWNA6957]. Ironically, the foreign currency pressures are rooted in the country's export success. A large chunk of the debts relate to hedging forward currency trading by shipbuilders -- South Korea is home to the world's three biggest -- to cover billions of dollars in new ship orders. Banks had to borrow short-term dollars to square their foreign-currency positions after taking up the dollar/won forward offers from shipbuilders. In normal times, those loans can easily be rolled over, but since the U.S. sub-prime mortgage crisis erupted last year to trigger the current turmoil, the banks have found that is increasingly no longer the case.
