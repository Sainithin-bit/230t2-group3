 BEIJING  (Reuters) - China has issued guidelines to banks in an effort to improve their risk management and steel themselves against financial turbulence. 

 The banking regulator said on Friday its had issued detailed instructions to help banks meet the requirements stipulated in the Basel II agreement. The guidelines cover credit risk, internal controls, operational risk and capital base, the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) said. "It is a long-term fundamental solution for the banking system to handle financial crises," the CBRC said. The CBRC said the new set of rules will also help Chinese banks develop overseas business. Sources told Reuters earlier that the regulator was toughening its guidance on capital adequacy requirements for certain lenders to contain risks as the global financial crisis escalates and the domestic economy slows.
