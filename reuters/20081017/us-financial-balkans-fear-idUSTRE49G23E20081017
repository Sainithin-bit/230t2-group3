 BELGRADE  (Reuters) - Mirjana Tomasevic, a 63-year-old doctor from Belgrade, has seen too much over the past two decades to take any chances now. 

 Although the threat is only economic, and not a war like the ones that tore the Yugoslav Federation apart in the 1990s, she has joined others in cleaning out her bank account. "It's not rational thinking, I know. But in this country impossible things happened in the past," she said. Most economists would say she is over-reacting. But despite a decade of rebuilding, the global financial crisis has caused people across the Balkans to recall the 1990s, when wars virtually shut down the economy and caused mass unemployment and shortages of basic goods. Forget Serbia's blossoming economic growth, averaging more than 5 percent this decade, and the region's brightening prospects of European Union membership. And never mind that banks say they are well capitalized. Many Serbs have still rushed to withdraw all their cash. "People here are too sensitive to any turmoil given their previous experience," said Dusko Vasiljevic of the FREN/CEVES think tank. "There is no trust in a stable national currency. They don't trust banks." The main fear for policy makers across the Balkans is that such worries will actually trigger a crisis. PANIC WITHDRAWALS In Bosnia, banks experienced cash shortages after a wave of panic sparked mass withdrawals. Its central bank has pumped 100 million euros ($136 million) in cash to commercial banks. And in Serbia, the central bank issued a statement calling for calm after some tabloids published headlines reading "Panic," "Banks flee Serbia" and "Collapse." "The central bank is reassuring citizens these reports were misinformation and that citizens' deposits are safe," it said. Drina, a 38-year-old vendor in the Belgrade market, came to Serbia in 1991 when war broke out in Croatia, and has vivid memories of hyperinflation in 1993. "All these reports of crisis make me think of what we have been through," she said, declining to give her last name. "The thing I fear the most are shortages of basic food items." Her comments were echoed by others, even though inflation was still at 9.9 percent in September, a 10-month low, and officials have reported no shortages of food or other items. Macedonia and Albania have so far been spared mass withdrawals -- authorities and economists say their limited integration with or exposure to international finance has largely insulated them from the crisis. But here too, confidence in financial institutions is limited, and many remember how tens of thousands lost their savings in pyramid schemes in the 1990s. "I am not scared," said Dimitar Petkovski, 56, in the Macedonian capital Skopje. "We are so poor already. Our economic crisis hasn't just started now -- it has been here since the beginning of the 90s."
