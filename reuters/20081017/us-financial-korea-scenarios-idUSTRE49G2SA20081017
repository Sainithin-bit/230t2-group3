 (Reuters) - Top South Korean financial authorities plan to unveil measures on Sunday aimed at calming markets dragged down by the global financial turbulence threatening the country's highly leveraged banks. 

 Finance Minister Kang Man-soo told reporters on Friday his ministry would announce the measures at 1 a.m. EDT on Sunday jointly with the central bank and the financial regulatory agency, but did not elaborate on details. Following are the outlines of measures local media and analysts say South Korea might take: EMERGENCY RATE CUT The Bank of Korea could make an emergency rate cut to lower credit costs, hoping to boost sentiment among consumers, investors and businesses. The central bank cut its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 5.0 percent at a regular meeting on October 9 and hot on the heels of coordinated rate cuts by global central banks. It marked the Bank of Korea's first cut this year and followed eight increases. It has made an emergency rate cut only once since adopting its current rate-setting system in 1999. That was when it lowered rates by half a percentage point soon after the September 11, 2001, attacks in the United States. EASING RESERVE REQUIREMENTS The Bank of Korea could lower reserve requirements on deposits held by commercial banks, which would free up more of the deposits for lending and ease a liquidity squeeze. GUARANTEE OF DEPOSITS, DEBT BY BANKS The government may guarantee not only deposits held in local commercial banks, but their debts as well, in all currencies, to try to ease the funding squeeze for Korean banks. But such guarantees would require parliamentary approval, which could mean some time before the measures would be in force. A government guarantee would sharply increase confidence in individual commercial banks and make it much easier for the banks to borrow from abroad or at home. SPECIAL TOOLS TO INJECT CASH Financial authorities may come up with special methods to quickly and directly inject cash into individual commercial banks in urgent need of funds. The central bank has kept won liquidity high through repurchase agreements and bond auctions, but banks most in need may still have trouble accessing the money markets. SHARP INCREASE IN FX PROVISION The Bank of Korea may offer to sharply increase the size of its dollar injections into local money markets. It has been supplying dollars into the local dollar/won swap market but the cost of dollar funding remains high. The finance ministry may also sharply increase the size of lending in dollars to commercial banks after it supplied $5 billion through the state-run Export-Import Bank of Korea. STOCK-RELATED TAX/FEE CUTS The government may lower or exempt for a limited period taxes and commission fees related to stock investment, such as stock transaction taxes and capital gains taxes on investments made through investment funds, to calm the stock markets.
