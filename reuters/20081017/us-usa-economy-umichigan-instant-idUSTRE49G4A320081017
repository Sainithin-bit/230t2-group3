 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Consumer confidence suffered its steepest monthly drop on record in October, a survey showed on Friday, as the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression sent shocks waves through the economy. 

 KEY POINTS: * The Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers said its index of confidence plummeted to 57.5 in October from 70.3 in September. * The index is now at its lowest since June this year. The report said there have only been four surveys that posted monthly declines of 10 index points or more. * The index came out well below economists' expectations for a reading of 65.5, according to the median of their forecasts in a Reuters poll. Their 64 forecasts ranged from 55.0 to 70.0. * The University of Michigan confidence index dates back to 1952. Its record low was 51.7, which it hit in May 1980. * Consumers rated current economic conditions the worst on record, with this gauge falling to 58.9 from September's 75.0. * Short-term inflation expectations actually rose, but five-year inflation expectations fell to 2.8 percent, its lowest since October 2007, from 3.0 percent in September. COMMENTS: DOUG SMITH, CHIEF ECONOMIST FOR THE AMERICAS, STANDARD CHARTERED, NEW YORK: "Confidence is collapsing so that's not good even as you have gas prices falling. People are seeing what's happening to their 401ks, stocks and home prices. It's just awful." TONY CRESCENZI, CHIEF BOND MARKET STRATEGIST, MILLER, TABAK & CO, NEW YORK: "It is easy to understand why the index declined, so it is questionable how much impact the index will have, similar to yesterday when the Philly (Philadelphia Fed) survey was not really the shock that the forecast miss implied. Investors are certainly braced for bad news, as evidenced by the behavior of the financial markets, and given the massive amount of media coverage over recent events." JOHN MCCARTHY, DIRECTOR, FX TRADING, ING CAPITAL MARKETS, NEWYORK: "Obviously a miserable number. Essentially the euro is fractionally stronger so the dollar sold a tiny bit but virtually no change. So much of the bad news here and abroad is already priced in. This reinforces the financial crisis is passing through to the underlying economy and by extension to economies globally. Implied, is continued deleveraging. There is some pressure on equities and high yielding currencies. That produces a bit of a stronger dollar against everything other than the yen and the Swiss franc." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. equities remain lower after data. BONDS: Treasury debt prices extend gains. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar little changed after data. RATE FUTURES: Little changed, continue to indicate expectations of rate cut at October meeting.
