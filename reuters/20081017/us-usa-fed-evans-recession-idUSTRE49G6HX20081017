 FOND DU LAC, Wisc.  (Reuters) - Charles Evans, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said on Friday that the current spike in the U.S. jobless rate suggests the economy will almost surely slip into recession. 

 Speaking to reporters after a speech in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, Evans declined to say if the economy is already in recession, but referred to the labor market as a touchstone. "Unemployment rarely goes up this much without a recession following," he said. "We're facing major economic challenges." Evans is not a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee in 2008.
