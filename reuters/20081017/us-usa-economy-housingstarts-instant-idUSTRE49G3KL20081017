 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Construction starts on new U.S. homes fell to a new 17-1/2 year low in September as builders scaled back amid a worsening housing slump and growing turmoil in financial markets that helped pushed permits for new homes to a nearly 27-year low. 

 KEY POINTS: * The Commerce Department reported on Friday that starts on new homes fell 6.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate 817,000 units, their slowest pace since January 1991. * This was well below the 880,000 rate that Wall Street economists polled by Reuters had expected. * The September rate of starts on single-family homes fell 12.0 percent to a 544,000-unit annual rate, the slowest pace since August 1982. * New applications for building permits fell 8.3 percent in September to an annual rate of 786,000. COMMENTS: MARK ZANDI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S ECONOMY.COM, WEST CHESTER, PENNSYLVANIA: "Home builders are slashing construction. Not only is housing demand falling but builders can't get credit to build homes. The slide in construction will continue into next year. This will be a significant weight on the economy." "Now construction is so low that it is running below demand so it will make it easier to clear overhanging inventory. This is ultimately necessary for the housing market to be revived." "Q3 GDP will come in negative, at least minus 0.5 percentage point. What will mitigate it will be an increase in inventory. Clearly the economy lost any momentum it had when the quarter ended. Q4 (GDP) is expected to be a very negative quarter." PETER KENNY, MANAGING DIRECTOR, KNIGHT EQUITY MARKETS, JERSEY CITY, NEW JERSEY: "On its face, the data appears quite dire, but if you dig a little deeper, and you're looking at where the market will be instead of where it is, it's very constructive. The market has to dig through inventory before it can find solid foundations upon which to bounce. The housing inventory overhang needs to be digested in order for us to move forward." STEPHEN MALYON, CHIEF CURRENCY STRATEGIST, SCOTIA CAPITAL, TORONTO: "Obviously weaker than expected in terms of the consensus, however it is not necessarily a surprise following yesterday's resumed drop in home builder sentiment. With mortgage rates once again climbing, housing related numbers are likely to disappoint in the months ahead. The glass half full take is that the sharp decline in homebuilder activity should serve to quicken the eventual stabilization in home supply. Dollar/yen dropping as investors shy away from risk." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. equity index futures extend losses after data. BONDS: Treasury debt prices add slightly to early gains. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar extends losses vs. yen. RATE FUTURES: Fed fund futures hold gains, indicating expectations for an interest rate cut at October meeting.
