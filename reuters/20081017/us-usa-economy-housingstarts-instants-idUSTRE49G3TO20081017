 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Construction starts on new U.S. homes fell to a new 17-1/2 year low in September as builders scaled back amid a worsening housing slump and growing turmoil in financial markets that helped pushed permits for new homes to a nearly 27-year low. 

 KEY POINTS: * The Commerce Department reported on Friday that starts on new homes fell 6.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate 817,000 units, their slowest pace since January 1991. * This was well below the 880,000 rate that Wall Street economists polled by Reuters had expected. * The September rate of starts on single-family homes fell 12.0 percent to a 544,000-unit annual rate, the slowest pace since August 1982. * New applications for building permits fell 8.3 percent in September to an annual rate of 786,000. COMMENTS: TIM GHRISKEY, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, SOLARIS ASSET MANAGEMENT, BEDFORD HILLS, NEW YORK: "Housing starts lower than expectations, and building permits also significantly lower than expectations. New housing is running below the level of household formation, and has been for several months, so this is certainly data that we need to see to stabilize the housing market," "So good news for the economy, bad news for builders, but certainly part of the healing process." SUBODH KUMAR, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, SUBODH KUMAR & ASSOCIATES, TORONTO: "It's slightly worse. I think from the Fed's point of view the housing and inflation numbers give them lots of leeway in terms of monetary policy, of easing without worrying about that aspect. "For the markets themselves, I think that a recession worse than 2000-2001 is already built in, but the housing numbers as well as some of the retail numbers we've been seeing suggests the consumer remains very weak. "There are two schools of thought. One is that housing and the permit numbers are weak. But the other one is the view that in the existing housing, perhaps a lot of houses have been taken off the market because people can't get the price that they want. "Whether its the sales of existing homes or starts or permits, it looks like there's still more weakness there. If the sales have started to clear up because people have thrown in a towel that's a plus, but if the homes have been taken off the market, that's not so good." CHRISTOPHER LOW, CHIEF ECONOMIST, FTN FINANCIAL, NEW YORK: "The good news is it brings us closer to finishing this correction in inventories. Builders are absolutely as pessimistic as I think I have ever seen them. The NAHB index yesterday was also a solid three points below the prior record low. It may be the capitulation, but I think what it also shows is those in the housing industry are not at all confident that we are close to a bottom in sales or prices. I don't think it does change the picture. Unfortunately I think it is now pretty much general consensus that there is still more downside on sales and prices. There was some optimism on the housing industry as recently as the late second quarter, but I guess we are back in full-blown pessimistic mode now." NIGEL GAULT, DIRECTOR, U.S. ECONOMIC RESEARCH, GLOBAL INSIGHT, LEXINGTON MASSACHUSETTS: "Another big leg downwards. We have now combination of the underlying housing crisis, which was still driving starts down because we've got a huge oversupply of homes on the market. "We've now got on top of that an economy-wide recession which of course means that people will be less able to buy homes, more of them will be losing their jobs so sales will go down further. "And we will also have builders thinking of putting up new homes naturally finding it much more difficult to find credit given the tightening in the credit crunch. "At the moment it's almost a perfect storm, which is driving housing starts down to unprecedented levels." ALAN RUSKIN, CHIEF INTERNATIONAL STRATEGIST, RBS GLOBAL BANKING, GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT: "Housing starts tumbled, and the signal from single starts and permits suggests there are no obvious distortions to the simple read of a renewed acceleration in weakness in the housing sector. I fear we will see much worse numbers in October as the full extent of the credit crisis takes hold. Is this a surprise to the market? Unfortunately no. If you thought it could not go much lower, think again." MARK ZANDI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S ECONOMY.COM, WEST CHESTER, PENNSYLVANIA: "Home builders are slashing construction. Not only is housing demand falling but builders can't get credit to build homes. The slide in construction will continue into next year. This will be a significant weight on the economy." "Now construction is so low that it is running below demand so it will make it easier to clear overhanging inventory. This is ultimately necessary for the housing market to be revived." "Q3 GDP will come in negative, at least minus 0.5 percentage point. What will mitigate it will be an increase in inventory. Clearly the economy lost any momentum it had when the quarter ended. Q4 (GDP) is expected to be a very negative quarter." PETER KENNY, MANAGING DIRECTOR, KNIGHT EQUITY MARKETS, JERSEY CITY, NEW JERSEY: "On its face, the data appears quite dire, but if you dig a little deeper, and you're looking at where the market will be instead of where it is, it's very constructive. The market has to dig through inventory before it can find solid foundations upon which to bounce. The housing inventory overhang needs to be digested in order for us to move forward." STEPHEN MALYON, CHIEF CURRENCY STRATEGIST, SCOTIA CAPITAL, TORONTO: "Obviously weaker than expected in terms of the consensus, however it is not necessarily a surprise following yesterday's resumed drop in home builder sentiment. With mortgage rates once again climbing, housing related numbers are likely to disappoint in the months ahead. The glass half full take is that the sharp decline in homebuilder activity should serve to quicken the eventual stabilization in home supply. Dollar/yen dropping as investors shy away from risk." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. equity index futures extend losses after data. BONDS: Treasury debt prices add slightly to early gains. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar extends losses vs. yen. RATE FUTURES: Fed fund futures hold gains, indicating expectations for an interest rate cut at October meeting.
