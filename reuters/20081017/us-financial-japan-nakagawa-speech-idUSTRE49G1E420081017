 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japanese Finance Minister Shoichi Nakagawa said on Friday that tensions in global financial markets were heightening. 

 Japan's financial system is in good shape compared with that of Europe and the United States, but government authorities need to be on alert for developments, Nakagawa, who is also banking minister, said at an annual meeting of credit unions. (Reporting by  Leika Kihara  and Kaori Kaneko)
