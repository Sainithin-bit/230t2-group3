 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan is looking at easing accounting rules as an emergency step to soften the blow from losses on risky credit products, joining other global authorities to contain the fallout from the global market turmoil. 

 Prime Minister Taro Aso said on Friday that the recent market volatility could badly damage the nation's economy and its financial system, suggesting Japanese authorities' confidence in its banking sector may be waning. "What we must do first is maintain the health of Japan's financial system," Aso told parliament. "We need to bear in mind that the damage to the economy could be quite big." Japan's financial sector has been relatively healthy compared with that of the United States and Europe. But some regional and smaller banks have called for easier accounting rules to avoid posting huge valuation losses on their investment portfolios. Finance and Banking Minister Shoichi Nakagawa said he has asked a body in charge of setting accounting standards to reach a quick decision on temporarily changing mark-to-market accounting rules, which require firms to assess financial holdings at market value. "I think we should change the rules," he told reporters. Such a move would follow similar steps by the European Union, which eased fair value accounting rules on Wednesday, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which has agreed to a request from banks that could allow them to delay writedowns on certain securities. A spokesman for the Accounting Standards Board of Japan said it was considering changing its accounting rules to lessen the losses from some risky debt products. But it is unlikely to decide on the matter until November, and any change in rules would still require companies to mark their stock portfolios at market price, the spokesman said. That means any changes would likely have little effect on Japanese banks because of their massive equity portfolios, said Jason Rogers, credit analyst at Barclays Capital. "For Japanese banks it's all about stocks, so I don't know how much it is really going to help," he said. Reflecting growing alarm over the widening credit crisis, a panel of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party was considering schemes to recapitalize big banks with government money, Kyodo news agency reported. Japan unveiled steps to stabilize its financial markets this week, including a possible injection of public funds into regional banks that it said would be aimed at enhancing smooth financing for smaller firms facing a possible credit crunch. NOT RULING OUT CRISIS SUMMIT Government officials remained on high alert over mounting woes for an economy already teetering on the brink of recession, with the Nikkei stock average recovering only modestly from Thursday's drop, its biggest one-day fall in 20 years. Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said tensions in global financial markets were extremely high and adding to uncertainty over the bank's view that the economy, after a period of sluggishness, will return to moderate growth. "We must be mindful of how recent global financial market turmoil could, through worsening world economic conditions, affect Japan's economy," Shirakawa said in a speech to an annual meeting of credit unions. France, Germany and Britain have called for a meeting of leaders of the Group of Eight (G8) industrialized countries and emerging economies next month to look at a radical overhaul of the world's 60-year-old financial architecture. Nakagawa said he would not rule out a meeting but that it must produce results, repeating Japan's view that any gathering should be held on condition that measures concrete enough to stem the crisis can be agreed upon. Japan chairs the G8 this year. Under mark-to-market or fair-value rules, companies are obliged regularly to adjust the valuation of assets they hold to reflect changes in their actual price on the market. The rules are intended to improve transparency by preventing companies from inflating their balance sheets by setting artificially high values on the assets they hold. But in the current crisis, where markets for many complex derivative products have disappeared or where illiquid markets have created sharp swings in prices, it is often impossible to establish a true market value for a particular asset.
