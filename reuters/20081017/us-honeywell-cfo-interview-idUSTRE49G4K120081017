 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Honeywell International Inc ( HON.N ) is concerned that its order backlog could be vulnerable to a slowing world economy, but has not yet seen business disrupted, the diversified U.S. manufacturer's chief financial officer said on Friday. 

 Like many big industrials, Honeywell is counting on a large order book for products sold into long-planned projects, like oil platforms and overhauls of hospital systems, to help keep revenue growing as the world economy slows. Asked if he was concerned that the slowdown could cause some customers to pull orders out, CFO Dave Anderson said: "That's a real concern. There is lots of historic evidence that that kind of thing occurs." But he added in a phone interview: "To this date, we haven't seen major disruption in our business." The company does not disclose the value of its order backlog. The world's largest maker of cockpit electronics, which also produces building-control systems like thermostats, plans to reduce its exposure to the troubled commercial paper market during the fourth quarter. The company had "a couple billion dollars" of commercial paper outstanding on September 30, but has access to bank credit facilities that would more than cover that amount, Anderson said. "We'll bring that down in the fourth quarter; we'll retire commercial paper debt in the fourth quarter with funds from operations," Anderson said. "The fourth quarter is always a very strong cash flow quarter for us." (Reporting by  Scott Malone ; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
