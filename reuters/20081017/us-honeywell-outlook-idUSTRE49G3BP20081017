 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Diversified U.S. manufacturer Honeywell International Inc ( HON.N ) forecast a fourth-quarter profit that was below analysts' expectations on Friday. 

 The world's largest maker of cockpit electronics said it expects to earn 97 cents to $1.01 per share on revenue of $9.4 billion in the fourth quarter. Analysts, on average, had looked for profit of $1.04 per share on sales of $9.8 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. The forecast came in slides posted to the company's Web site ahead of a conference call with investors. Earlier on Friday, Honeywell reported third-quarter profit that topped Wall Street's expectations. (Reporting by  Scott Malone ; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)
