 BAGHDAD  (Reuters) - The White House said it did not expect any announcement on an auto industry rescue plan before President George W. Bush returns to the United States. 

 "I don't anticipate anything before we return ... I just don't expect anything for a while," White House spokeswoman Dana Perino told reporters on Air Force One before Bush arrived in Baghdad on Sunday on an unannounced visit. She was responding to a question on whether an announcement would be made during Bush's trip on whether the administration would tap a $700 billion financial industry bailout fund to aid ailing automakers. Perino said she had no timetable for such a decision. (Reporting by  Matt Spetalnick ; editing by  Mohammad Zargham )
