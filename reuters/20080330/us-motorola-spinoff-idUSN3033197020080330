 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Motorola Inc's MOT.N decision to spin off its handset division will not raise a share buying opportunity for investors and will not improve chances of a turnaround at the unit, Barron's reported on Sunday. 

 Motorola does not have a detailed plan as to how, or specifically when, the spin-off will occur, Barron's said in its March 31 edition. The paper said Motorola has also been unable to find a qualified executive to manage the new handset company. "There's a lot of execution risk" to the spin-off plan, Mark Sue, RBC Capital Markets analyst, said in the Barron's report. It said the notion that a spin-off would improve the chances of a turnaround in handsets is "seriously flawed". (Reporting by  Yinka Adegoke , editing by Maureen Bavdek)
