 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The number of U.S. workers filing new applications for unemployment insurance unexpectedly rose last week as claims delayed from the year-end holidays were pushed through, government data showed on Thursday. 

 KEY POINTS: * Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 36,000 to a seasonally adjusted 482,000 in the week ended January 16, the Labor Department said, rising for a third straight week. * Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims dipping to 440,000 from a previously reported 444,000. * The weekly claims data covers the survey week for the Labor Department's January payrolls report, which is scheduled for release February 5. COMMENTS: SUBODH KUMAR, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, SUBODH KUMAR & ASSOCIATES, TORONTO: "It is positive that the number is still less than 500,000 but it is not positive that it is seems to be recovering very slowly. "Markets so far have been reflecting the economic recovery that was anticipated at the end of 2009 may not be as expected, and you may see a pullback in stocks and a little more firmness in bonds." DAVID RESLER, CHIEF U.S. ECONOMIST, NOMURA SECURITIES, NEW YORK: "The headline certainly stood out -- caught everybody's attention. The BLS is reporting that there had been some administrative delays counting the claims -- that means numbers for the previous few weeks should have been a little bit higher. "This probably reflects less a deterioration of labor market conditions than the recognition that the improvement was probably a little less than previously reported. "Claims didn't fall in November relative to December as much as we thought. We smooth them all out, probably the four-week average gives you an idea of where things are." "Maybe there's a little too much optimism built into the market so there probably should be some realization that maybe this economy hasn't improved as much as some people thought it had. Things are better than where they were a few months back but we're not generating job growth. "It makes the drop in nonfarm payrolls at the beginning of the month look a little less perplexing." CAMILLA SUTTON, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST, SCOTIA CAPITAL, TORONTO: "It's a jump-up in jobless claims after we've had a nice downward trend the last few week. It's a little concerning but all the data we've seen so far indicates that there is a recovery. It has been fairly volatile of late but we kind of expect that at this stage of the recovery. One data point does not make a trend. In the meantime, I don't think this would affect the dollar much because for now everybody wants to sell the euro." KEVIN CARON, MARKET STRATEGIST, STIFEL, NICOLAUS & CO, FLORHAM PARK, NEW JERSEY: "Jobless claims rose. The excuse is that at the end of the year there were administrative delay in processing new applicants because of the holidays. The rise is statistical noise and it won't be big for the market. Today is all about earnings." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stock index futures fall BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices pare losses DOLLAR: U.S. dollar pairs gains slightly versus yen
