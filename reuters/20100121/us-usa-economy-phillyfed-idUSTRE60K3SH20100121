 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Factory activity slowed more than expected in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic region in January, paring expectations of manufacturing's role in helping a U.S. economic recovery, a survey showed on Thursday. 

 The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank said its business activity index slipped to 15.2 from 22.5 in December, which was a 4-1/2-year high. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a January reading of 18.0. Any reading above zero indicates growth in the region's manufacturing sector. The survey covers factories in a region encompassing eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware and is looked at closely as one of the first indicators of the health of the U.S. manufacturing sector.
