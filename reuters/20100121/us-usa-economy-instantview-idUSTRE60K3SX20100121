 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Factory activity slowed more than expected in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic region in January, paring expectations of manufacturing's role in helping a U.S. economic recovery, a survey showed on Thursday. 

 The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank said its business activity index slipped to 15.2 from 22.5 in December, which was a 4-1/2 year high. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a January reading of 18.0. Any reading above zero indicates growth in the region's manufacturing sector. The survey covers factories in a region encompassing eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware and is looked at closely as one of the first indicators of the health of the U.S. manufacturing sector. The U.S. Conference Board said its index of leading economic indicators rose for the 9th straight month to a record high in December. The index rose 1.1 percent to an all-time high of 106.4 last month, compared to expectations for a 0.7 percent rise. COMMENTS: JOSEPH LAVORGNA, CHIEF U.S. ECONOMIST, DEUTSCHE BANK SECURITIES, NEW YORK: "Leading indicators tells us that the economy looks to have grown at a pretty sizable rate in Q4, we estimate five percent. We think growth will be somewhere in the four to five percent range this quarter." "Philly Fed is a non-event. I don't see anything interesting in numbers, it is just a continuation of trend. Manufacturing is going to do the heavy lifting in any recovery, and until we see any outright hiring the market is not going to treat this other data with much enthusiasm. JAMES O'SULLIVAN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MF GLOBAL, NEW YORK LEADING INDICATORS: "It's due primarily to the jump in data on housing permits yesterday. This clearly signals a sustained recovery, and there's more improvement ahead." PHILADELPHIA FED BUSINESS INDEX: "There is a clear-cut rebound in manufacturing. The Philly number is down more than expected but it is still consistent with the solid growth in manufacturing. The six-month outlook and capital spending indexes are still up. This is not a dramatic change from the recent trend." DOUG ROBERTS, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST AT CHANNEL CAPITAL RESEARCH.COM IN SHREWSBURY, NEW JERSEY: "Even though the Philly Fed numbers were less than expected, the S&P kicked up again. But at the same time, you're not seeing a huge rally, we're just in a trading range." "The general idea you're really seeing is there is still a drag on the economy. The positive thing about this is that we're in a sweet spot and the real question is can we stay in a sweet spot vis-a-vis the market. Right now you're sitting in sweet spot where the government has no real incentive to pull back and is continuing to make easy money. TONY CRESCENZI, MARKET STRATEGIST AND PORTFOLIO MANAGER WITH PACIFIC INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT CO. (PIMCO) IN NEWPORT BEACH, CALIFORNIA: "The Philadelphia Fed employment component reached a new high. All the data we have seen today suggests that industrial output is rising in January, which might have positive implications for employment, but with the qualifier of the jobless claims data today (showing more weakness than expected)." ALAN GAYLE, SENIOR INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, RIDGEWORTH INVESTMENTS IN RICHMOND, VIRGINIA: "It looks like the recovery momentum is still very much in place and it suggests that we should have good growth going through the first half of the year. On the negative side, much of this good news is built into the stock market and analysts are looking at what will drive potential growth in the second half of the year. That's where the nervousness comes in." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: US benchmark S&P500 stock index was little changed BONDS: US Treasury debt prices were steady DOLLAR: US dollar also unaffected.
