 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - American Express Co and Capital One Financial Corp both reported better than forecast fourth quarter earnings, but expressed concern about the growth outlook for credit cards. 

 American Express, the largest U.S. credit card company by purchases, posted much higher fourth quarter earnings, beating forecasts, helped by rising consumer spending and lower credit losses, but revenue was flat. The credit card lender and payment network said net income rose to $716 million, or 60 cents a share, from $240 million, or 21 cents a share in the same quarter a year earlier. Stripping out a penny of earnings from discontinued operations, the credit card company earned 59 cents a share. On that basis, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S had forecast earnings of 57 cents a share. Revenues net of interest expense were roughly flat at $6.5 billion, beating analysts' forecast of $6.1 billion. Still, the lack of revenue gains, may have disappointed some investors. American Express shares were down 1.6 percent in after-hours trading. "A huge chunk of the income gain was derived from reduced credit losses -- although this is to be very much applauded, it is important to point out that overall revenue was basically stagnant," Celent analyst Red Gillen said in a prepared comment. "While this may be relatively acceptable in a recessionary environment, it will not be well-received by investors in a growing world economy." MORE MODEST GROWTH In the most recent quarter, American Express' provisions for losses slid 47 percent to $748 million. Chief Financial Officer Dan Henry told investors on a conference call that growth would remain slow going forward. "We expect the global economy to continue to recover gradually, and the resulting environment to be characterized by billings growth that is more modest than we experienced before the recession, as consumers and businesses remain cautious about their spending," he said. Executives at Capital One, another major credit card issuer, were similarly cautious on the industry's growth potential, citing, as did Henry, new consumer-oriented regulations that will take effect this year. Capital One shares were 1.1 percent lower. The bank and credit card specialist reported net income of $376 million or 83 cents per share, down from $393 million in third quarter 2009. Revenues were $4.4 billion, a 4.7 percent decrease from the same period in 2008. The McLean, Virigina-based bank reported its credit card business was the biggest profit driver for the quarter, reporting $509.9 million in net income from the unit, a 74 percent rise from the prior quarter's income. Credit card revenue was $2.9 billion, down 2.2 percent from the prior quarter. Credit card delinquencies remained high from the third quarter of 2009, as charge-offs remained roughly the same at 9.58 percent. American Express suffered big credit losses in 2008 and 2009 after boosting its lending earlier this decade, but losses began stabilizing last year. The company is now looking to focus its efforts on charge cards, where customers have to pay off the balance every month. American Express' shares rose more than 115 percent last year, outpacing the Standard & Poor's 500 index's increase of 23 percent, as it turned in earnings throughout the economic downturn and emerged as one of the stronger financial companies.
