 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Share prices dropped sharply on Thursday after President Barack Obama proposed new limits on top bank risk profiles, spurring safe-haven U.S. Treasury purchases but undercutting gains for the U.S. dollar. 

 Obama said he is ready to fight the financial sector and its lobbyists for rules that would bar banks from owning, sponsoring or investing in hedge funds or private equity funds for their own profit, causing a bank share sell-off. Europe's stock markets, closing just as the announcement was made, fell in concert with already weak U.S. stocks after a surprise increase in U.S. weekly jobless claims reduced optimism about economic recovery from the global financial crisis. "If you look at bank earnings over the last few years, what some of the more astute banks have been able to do is to smooth (out) their earnings using trading activity," said Subodh Kumar, chief investment strategist at Subodh Kumar & Associates in Toronto. "Presumably this (proposal) is going to hold that down. So the ability to generate revenues just by trading on their own accounts is going to go down." Goldman Sachs Group ( GS.N ), one of Wall Street's top earners, lost 4.12 percent to $160.87 per share. The firm, along with many of the other top U.S. banks, has been roundly criticized for paying large bonuses. Goldman, earlier on Thursday, reported better-than-expected fourth quarter net income of $4.95 billion. JPMorgan ( JPM.N ) shares fell 6.59 percent to $40.54. At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  fell 213.27 points, or 2.01 percent, at 10,389.88 while the Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  lost 21.56 points, or 1.89 percent, at 1,116.48. Both indexes had their worst one-day percentage loss in nearly three months. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  dropped 25.55 points, or 1.12 percent, at 2,265.70. The pan European FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  fell 1.56 percent to a one-month closing low of 1,036.07. Mining companies Anglo American ( AAL.L ), BHP Billiton ( BLT.L ) and Rio Tinto ( RIO.L ) fell between 3.12 and 6.15 percent. The global trading day didn't start out as gloomy. Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei 225 stock index  .N225  rose 1.22 percent, buttressed by gains in technology shares and a stable yen. DOLLAR SINKS The potential for a redrawing of how Wall Street banks operate had a ripple effect across asset classes. The proposals caused a sell-off in the U.S. dollar. It fell sharply against the yen and relinquished gains against the euro, which earlier hit a six-month low against the U.S. currency. "The dollar is taking it on the chin after these comments, as the implication is they are negative for bank profitability. Everyone was looking for the dollar to continue rallying but the mood has definitely soured," said Shaun Osborne, senior strategist at TD Securities in Toronto. The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major trading-partner currencies, fell back from near six-month highs to a gain of just 0.06 percent at 78.388 .DXY. The dollar was down 0.91 percent at 90.42 against the yen while the euro was off just 0.06 percent against the dollar at $1.4093, having been as low as $1.4025 on concerns about Greece's debt woes. Concerns over Greece's debt problems drove yields on its 10-year government bonds versus German Bunds to 312 basis points, the widest since Greece joined the euro zone in 2001. However, an unconfirmed report in a Brussels-based weekly newspaper that the European Union was mulling a loan to Athens caused investors to buy back debt and snap the yield spread tighter by 36 basis points. European bond prices rose and yields fell late in their session as stock markets fell. The 10-year Bund yield slipped 1.3 basis points to 3.212 percent. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries rose 14/32 of a point in price, driving the yield down to 3.599 percent. Spot gold prices fell $16.50, or 1.48 percent, to $1,094.80, a near 3-week low, while U.S. light sweet crude oil fell $1.72, or 2.21 percent, to $76.02 per barrel, a one-month nadir.
