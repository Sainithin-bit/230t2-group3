 BEIJING  (Reuters) - Daimler AG ( DAIGn.DE ) will sell its Smart small car in China from next year, head of sales and marketing Klaus Maier said on Saturday. 

 "I am happy to announce that Smart, the original micro compact car, is coming to China next year," Maier, who is executive vice-president marketing and sales at Daimler's Mercedes-Benz Cars unit, told journalists. "If you've spent any time on the streets of Beijing, you know that it is the perfect place for creative solutions to urban mobility -- and not only for Beijing; here in China, statistically speaking a city the size of New York emerges every 10 months," he said. He said Chinese customers could buy the car from the middle of next year. (Reporting by  Marcel Michelson ; Editing by Ruth Pitchford)
