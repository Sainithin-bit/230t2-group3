 (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc ( BLK.N ) will have about $2.8 trillion of assets under management after it completes its purchase of Barclays Global Investors. 

 That's a lot of money. How much? $2.8 trillion is: * about equal to the gross domestic product of the UK * more than the combined net worth of the world's 50 richest people ($2.4 trillion), according to Forbes * more than the holdings of the U.S. Federal Reserve ($2.2 trillion) * bigger than the assets of the largest bank in the United States, Bank of America ($2.32 trillion) And finally, 2.8 trillion is about 765 times the distance between Pluto and the sun in miles.
