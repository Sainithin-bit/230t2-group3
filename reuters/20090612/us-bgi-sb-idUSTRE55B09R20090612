 LONDON  (Reuters) - U.S. money manager BlackRock bought Barclays Global Investors (BGI) for $6.6 billion cash and 37.8 million shares on Thursday to create a global asset manager twice the size of its nearest rival [ID:nN11525846]. 

 Here are some facts about BGI: --BGI has over $1.5 trillion in assets under management, ranking it as the biggest global funds firm, and more than 3,000 institutional clients. At the end of 2008 it managed $939 billion of indexed assets, $231 billion of active assets and $325 billion at iShares, its exchange traded funds provider. It is also one of the world's major securities lenders. BGI made a pretax profit of 595 million pounds in 2008, down 19 percent from the year before, hurt by currency moves and costs of supporting some liquidity products. The unit's profits were 65 million pounds in 2000, and started to accelerate from 2003. --The company is based in San Francisco. Many of its staff are graduates from the nearby University of California at Berkeley. It also has research teams in London, Sydney and Tokyo. --BGI employs over 3,000 staff. Hundreds of them are in line for millions of dollars due to a lucrative employee ownership plan dating back to 2000 that could give them 10.3 percent ownership once options are exercised. The company prides itself on its small army of PhDs, renowned for designing its complex products to beat the stock market. --BGI was a core leg of Barclays President Bob Diamond's investment banking and investment management business. It is run by Chief Executive Blake Grossman, a Stanford University graduate who joined in 1985 and whose favorite film is Dr Strangelove, Stanley Kubrick's apocalyptic satire about a brilliant but unhinged scientist. Grossman laid the groundwork for BGI's lofty academic aspirations in 1992, when he set up an internal think tank at Wells Fargo's asset management unit, called the Advanced Active Strategies Group, which later became part of BGI. --BGI's history dates back more than 35 years. It created the first index strategy in 1971 and the first quantitative active strategy in 1979. It pioneered the exchange traded funds business with the launch of iShares nine years ago. BGI in its current form was built in 1996 when Barclays welded its BZW Asset Management unit with Wells Fargo and Nikko Securities, which it picked up for $440 million. (Compiled by Steve Slater)
