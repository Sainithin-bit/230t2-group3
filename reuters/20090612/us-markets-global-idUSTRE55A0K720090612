 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar recovered some of this week's losses on Friday, pressuring oil and other commodities, while the Dow edged into positive territory for the first time this year since January in lackluster trade. 

 U.S. Treasury debt rallied, extending a retreat in benchmark yields from eight-month highs, as investors breathed a sigh of relief after the U.S. government this week sold $65 billion in new debt with relative ease. The dollar rose broadly, rebounding from the week's steep sell-off, as demand for the euro fell after data showed a 21.6 percent plunge in euro zone industrial production in April -- a new record drop in output in the 16-country area. Investors had bet on an end to recession for most of the week, spurring many commodity prices to eight-month highs and lifting global stocks on hopes economic recovery would boost demand, before some profit-taking on Friday. "We're seeing a classic correction," said Brown Brothers Harriman currency strategist Meg Browne. "The top performers on the week are the worst performers today, suggesting the move is largely corrective in nature and will not be sustained." Oil fell to almost $72 a barrel, a day after reaching a near eight-month high on Thursday, while gold slid to a three-week low below $940 an ounce. Industrial metals also pulled back from this week's eight-month highs. Copper, used largely in construction, has gained more than 70 percent this year and about 10 percent so far in June on stronger economic data and hopes of increasing demand. The Reuters-Jefferies CRB index .CRB, which tracks the price of futures contracts of raw materials across 19 mostly U.S. traded markets, fell 1.5 percent. "Most commodity markets are still quite overbought and could be subject to a modest sell-off next week," said Edward Meir, analyst at MF Global. "We are getting to a stage where the steep run-up in prices has arguably over-discounted the modest brightening we are seeing in the U.S. macro picture." U.S. crude fell 64 cents to settle at $72.04 a barrel. London Brent crude settled 87 cents lower at $70.92 a barrel. Defensive sectors like pharmaceuticals -- companies that tend to weather a recession because their products are consumed regardless of the economy -- lifted the Dow and S&P500. The AMEX Pharmaceutical index .DRG gained 1.2 percent, while shares of consumer products maker Procter & Gamble Co ( PG.N ) rose 1 percent to $52.55. A disappointing outlook from National Semiconductor Corp ( NSM.N ) weighed on technology stocks, however. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  gained 28.34 points, or 0.32 percent, to 8,799.26. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  gained 1.32 points, or 0.14 percent, to 946.21. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  dropped 3.57 points, or 0.19 percent, to 1,858.80. The week was marked by low trading volumes. On the New York Stock Exchange almost half the number of shares traded hands on Friday as last year's estimated daily average of 1.49 billion. Stock volatility also was low. It was the sixth straight day that the percentage change in prices for the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500 index was less than 1 percent, the longest such streak since an 8-day run in April 2008. European shares snapped three days of gains as softer commodity prices weighed on energy and mining stocks. Demand for defensive stocks like pharmaceuticals offered support. The FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of top European companies closed down 0.2 percent at 885.75 points, after closing at its highest level in five months on Thursday. For the week, the index gained 1.5 percent. U.S. Treasury debt rose. The benchmark 10-year U.S. note was up 16/32 in price to yield 3.80 percent. The 2-year U.S. Treasury note gained 3/32 in price to yield 1.28 percent. The U.S. dollar rose against a basket of major currencies, with the Dollar Index .DXY up 0.76 percent at 80.168. The euro fell 0.65 percent at $1.4012, and against the yen, the dollar was up 0.83 percent at 98.36. U.S. August gold futures settled down $21.30, or 2.2 percent, at $940.70 an ounce in New York. Gains in Chinese industrial output and rising U.S. retail sales lifted Asian shares overnight toward new highs for the year. The MSCI index of Asia-Pacific stocks outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS fell 0.4 percent but Japan's Nikkei average  .N225  rose 1.6 percent to highs last seen in October.
