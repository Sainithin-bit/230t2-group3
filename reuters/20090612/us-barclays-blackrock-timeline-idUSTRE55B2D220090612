 (Reuters) - BlackRock has agreed to buy Barclays Global Investors (BGI) to create the world's biggest asset manager, in a $13.5 billion deal that Barclays hopes will put to rest concerns about its capital. 

 Following is a timeline of key events at Barclays in the past year: June 2008 - Barclays raises 4.5 billion pounds ($8.9 billion) from investors including Qatar and Japan's Sumitomo Mitsui; half the cash to be used to rebuild capital. September 2008 - Raises 701 million pounds ($1.3 billion) by selling shares to boost capital. October 2008 - Raises 7.3 billion pounds ($12.1 billion) mostly from Abu Dhabi and Qatar to repair damage from the global financial crisis and avoid taking UK government rescue funds. Feb 9, 2009 - Barclays reports a 14 percent drop in annual profit to 6.1 billion pounds ($9.01 billion). April 9 - Barclays agrees to sell its iShares asset management business to private equity firm CVC Capital Partners for 3 billion pounds ($4.4 billion). -- The bank says it expects to achieve a net gain on the deal of 1.5 billion pounds, which will add about 54 basis points to its equity tier 1 capital ratio, lifting it to 7.2 percent. April 22 - Qatar Holding, the biggest shareholder in Barclays, says it sold 35 million shares in Barclays to cut its stake to 5.8 percent from just over 6 percent. April 30 - Barclays offers to exchange 3.4 billion pounds ($5 billion) of bonds into debt of slightly higher quality to help strengthen its balance sheet after rivals including Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds Banking Group and Standard Chartered made similar offers. -- Two weeks later, on May 14, the Bank says it will make an 800 million pound ($1.2 billion) gain from the bond swap that will boost core Tier 1 equity by about 18 basis points. May 15 - Barclays says it has received "unsolicited interest" for BGI. Interested bidders for BGI include U.S. money manager BlackRock and U.S. bank Bank of New York Mellon, a person familiar with the matter says. June 2 - The Abu Dhabi government-owned International Petroleum Investment Company (IPIC) sells more than 11 percent of Barclays. June 12 - BlackRock agrees to buy BGI in a $13.5 billion deal that will see Barclays take a 19.9 percent stake and two seats on the board of the enlarged group, to be called BlackRock Global Investors.
