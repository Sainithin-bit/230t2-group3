 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Several big banks bailed out by U.S. taxpayers are expected to begin repaying their government debt next Wednesday, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal, which cited people familiar with the matter. 

 Treasury spokeswoman Meg Reilly declined to comment on the report and said, as the department has in past, that it planned to make public which banks had repaid government loans only in its regular reports. The Journal said that J.P. Morgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ), Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) and American Express Co ( AXP.N ) are among those expected to repay funds received from the government's Troubled Asset Relief Program, according to its sources. The companies received $25 billion, $10 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively. Ten banks have been given a green light by the U.S. government to pay back $68 billion in bailout funds from the Treasury Department. (Reporting by  Lilla Zuill , editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
