 (Reuters) - Boeing Co ( BA.N ) delayed plans to deliver its first carbon-composite 787 Dreamliner until the middle of the first quarter of 2011. 

 The delivery to Japan's All Nippon Airways ( 9202.T ) is already more than two years behind schedule. Here are five facts about the Boeing 787 Dreamliner: * The 787 Dreamliner promises greater fuel efficiency through the use of durable, lightweight composite materials. * Planes in the 787 family have list prices between $150 million and $205.5 million. * The 787 will use 20 percent less fuel for comparable missions in similarly sized airplanes. * Boeing has orders for 847 Dreamliners on its books. * The most recent delay relates to the availability of a Rolls-Royce ( RR.L ) engine needed for the final phases of flight testing.
