 PARIS  (Reuters) - The European Commission is blocking a French plan to shore up the capital positions of big retail banks, insisting they must reduce their lending in return for state support, the Financial Times reported on Saturday. 

 France announced last month that it would lend 10.5 billion euros ($13.6 billion) to the country's six top lenders before year-end to prop up their capital reserves. Paris has argued that without state support, lenders would have shored up their capital positions by reducing loans in the face of malfunctioning interbank lending markets, a move that would deal a fresh blow to an already troubled economy. The Financial Times said French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde spoke with European Union Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes on Friday to persuade her to lift her veto on France's bank support package. But Kroes was sticking to her view that banks cannot use state aid to increase their lending books, the paper said. "We have to apply the same criteria to everyone...support should be sufficient to offset the negative impact of the current financial crisis and no more," the paper quoted one anonymous official as saying. The French government had reacted furiously to the Commission's argument, the paper said, adding that one senior official had described it as "ridiculous" and "stupid" because it would exacerbate the credit crunch.
