 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Fairchild Semiconductor International Inc FCS.N filed a patent infringement lawsuit on Friday against Infineon Technologies AG ( IFXGn.DE ) in the U.S. District Courts of Maine and Delaware. 

 Fairchild, a maker of power management and analog microchips, said some of Infineon's products "infringe one or more claims of eight Fairchild patents" in a statement released Friday afternoon. The Infineon products in question are its CoolMOS and OptiMOS branded products, as well as its Infineon IGBT and CanPak products. "We are very confident in our position in this outgoing patent dispute and will fight to protect our intellectual property," said Fairchild Vice President and General Manager Justin Chiang. Germany-based chip maker Infineon and Fairchild have engaged in cross-license negotiations, but the talks recently soured, ultimately leading to the lawsuit, according to Fairchild. Infineon was not immediately available for comment. (Reporting by  Jennifer Martinez ; Editing by  Christian Wiessner )
