 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The second-largest Boeing Co ( BA.N ) union will count votes on the latest contract offer from the plane maker on Monday. 

 The vote, by more than 20,000 members of the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace (SPEEA), will also determine whether Boeing will suffer another strike at its Seattle-area plants, a month after its machinists returned to work after a 58-day strike. SPEEA, the less-militant, white collar engineers' union is expected to approve Boeing's four-year work contract, which is backed by union negotiators. The two sides reached a tentative deal two weeks ago, but the contract must be approved by a simple majority in a postal ballot. Two contracts are at stake. The first covers 13,898 Boeing engineers and the second covers 6,576 technical workers. The vast majority work at Boeing's Seattle-area plants, but some are also located in Oregon, Utah and California. Both contracts are set to expire on December 1. In addition to voting to accept or reject the offers for new contracts, SPEEA members will also vote on strike authorization, which would give union negotiators authority to call a strike if backed by a simple majority. That outcome is unlikely. SPEEA has struck Boeing only twice since organizing in 1946: for one day on January 19, 1993 and a 40-day strike in February and March of 2000. Boeing is still trying to get its production lines up to speed after the recent strike by the 27,000 members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) ended November 2. The company is expected to announce a new aircraft delivery schedule, taking into account the IAM strike and other production problems, some time in December.
