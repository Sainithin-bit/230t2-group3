 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Tokyo Electric Power Co said on Friday it has secured most of thermal fuel it needs for the summer when demand for electricity typically peaks. 

 Tokyo Electric is ramping up thermal power generation after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami crippled its Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, but higher fuel procurement expenses will be an extra blow as the utility grapples with massive costs related to the disaster. Tokyo Electric recorded a 1.25 trillion yen ($15.3 billion) loss for the past financial year, the biggest ever by a non-financial Japanese firm, hit by costs to cope with the world's worst nuclear crisis since Chernobyl.
