 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The euro fell against the U.S. dollar on Friday on fresh fears of a Greek debt default, which sent global stocks lower. 

 But even as the dollar strengthened against the euro, copper prices jumped on a decline in Chinese inventories, while oil prices rose sharply from early losses in choppy trading. Gold advanced on safe-haven buying. A report that Norway suspended the payment of a $42 million grant to Greece for failure to comply with its EU-IMF bailout commitments started a sell-off in the euro. Speculation mounted that Finland, a European Union member, would also suspend payments. A Greek daily reported the International Monetary Fund suspended its review of Greece until the government draws up further austerity measures. A suspension could mean a delay in the disbursement of much-needed IMF funds for Athens. In addition, rating agency Fitch further downgraded Greece's credit, fueling the euro's decline. The single currency was down 1.2 percent at $1.4144 on trading platform EBS after four days of gains, with investors focused on the $1.40 level as a short-term target. The news about problems with the EU-IMF Greek bailout plan almost overshadowed anxiety over Spain's upcoming regional election this weekend. Spanish bond yields rose on concern the vote results may undermine Prime Minister Rodriguez Zapatero's ability to curb Spain's own fiscal deficit. "The news has been tough all day for the euro. People were starting to buy the euro the last few days and then we got all this news, and then the euro just gave way," said Richard Franulovich, senior currency strategist, at Westpac in New York. The U.S. dollar index .DXY, a gauge of the greenback against a basket of currencies, rose 0.75 percent, while benchmark U.S. Treasuries prices were up 7/32 to yield 3.14 percent. On Wall Street bank shares were the hardest hit, though some retailers also weakened. "It's all about the euro," said Paul Mendelsohn, chief investment strategist at Windham Financial Services in Charlotte, Vermont. "It's not just the commodity stocks," he said. "As the dollar strengthens, multinational, dollar-sensitive large cyclical companies go down also." The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  lost 93.28 points, or 0.74 percent, to 12,512.04. The Standard & Poor's 500  .SPX  fell 10.33 points, or 0.77 percent, to 1,333.27. The Nasdaq Composite  .IXIC  dropped 19.99 points, or 0.71 percent, to 2,803.32. World stocks as measured by MSCI .MIWD00000PUS were down 0.57 percent and the Thomson Reuters global stocks index  .TRXFLDGLPU  dropped 0.67 percent. Copper prices jumped, with three-month copper up 1.5 percent as investors focused on data showing stockpiles in warehouses monitored by the Shanghai Futures Exchange fell 14.6 percent from last Friday. China is the world's largest consumer of industrial metals. Oil prices bounced back from a more than 2 percent decline on end-of-week short-covering after crude's intraday plunge ran into support. U.S. light crude futures gained 1.1 percent to settle at $99.491 as the contract expired on Friday. Brent crude was up 0.7 percent, above $112 a barrel. Gold rose 1.5 percent, its biggest daily gain in two weeks, on safe-haven buying as investors fretted about euro zone debt. Spot gold rose 1.5 percent to $1,513.20 by 4:17 p.m. EDT (2017 GMT). U.S. June gold futures settled up $16.50 at $1,508.90 an ounce, after trading between $1,486.40 and $1,515.80, which marked a one-week high.
