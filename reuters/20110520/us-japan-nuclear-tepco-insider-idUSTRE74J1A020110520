 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Tokyo Electric Power Co chose a company insider for its next president instead of someone from outside the firm because it placed emphasis on knowledge of the utility's operations, the current president said. 

 "We put the highest importance on experience and expertise in our business operations when we chose the person for the top post," President Masataka Shimizu told a news conference. Tokyo Electric announced earlier that Shimizu would step down to take responsibility for the crisis at its Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant and that managing director Toshio Nishizawa would replace him.
