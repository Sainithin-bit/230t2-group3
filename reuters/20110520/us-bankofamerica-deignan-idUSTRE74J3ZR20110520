 CHARLOTTE, North Carolina  (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) said on Friday that Mary Ann Deignan would join the company from UBS AG ( UBSN.VX ) to be its head of Americas equity capital markets. 

 Deignan will join the largest U.S. bank by assets in August and report to Dan Cummings, head of BofA's global equity capital markets. She fills the job vacated by Cummings when he was promoted last year, and will be based in New York. In her new role, Deignan will oversee the bank's equity capital markets operations in North and Latin America. Deignan spent seven years at UBS and was head of its Americas equity capital markets group since 2007. Before UBS, she spent 11 years at Merrill Lynch, now owned by Bank of America, in a variety of roles. (Reporting by Joe Rauch, editing by Gerald E. McCormick and Lisa Von Ahn)
