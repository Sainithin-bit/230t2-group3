 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Tokyo Electric Power Co said on Friday it would be difficult to raise funds this year through bond sales, as it grapples with the hefty costs of a prolonged crisis at its quake-hit nuclear power plant in Fukushima. 

 The power company on Friday reported a record 1.25 trillion yen ($15.3 billion) net loss for the year that ended on March 31 and said it planned to sell 600 billion yen in assets to raise cash. ($1 = 81.610 Japanese Yen) (Reporting by  Junko Fujita ; Writing by Edmund Klamann)
