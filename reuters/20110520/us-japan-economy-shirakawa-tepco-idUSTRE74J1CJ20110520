 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said ensuring financial market stability through a government-led compensation scheme to deal with claims against Tokyo Electric Power Co is crucial for paying those affected and ensuring a stable power supply. 

 Shirakawa declined to comment on whether banks should forgive loans to Tokyo Electric, known as Tepco, but said he expects banks and the company to hold talks and take appropriate action. He said the yen's rise would put downward pressure on the economy in the short term but in the long term would produce positive effects such as in facilitating acquisitions by companies of overseas firms. The BOJ board decided earlier on Friday to keep monetary policy steady in a sign that a first-quarter economic slump had not changed the central bank's view that growth will pick up around autumn, when the effects of the March 11 earthquake and tsunami begin to fade. In a surprise move, Deputy Governor Kiyohiko Nishimura dropped his proposal to loosen policy further with an expansion of the central bank's asset-buying scheme. He made such a proposal last month but was voted down by an 8-1 margin. (Reporting by  Leika Kihara  and Rie Ishiguro)
