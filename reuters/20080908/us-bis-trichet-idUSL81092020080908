 BASEL  (Reuters) - U.S. moves to take over mortgage firms Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were important and welcome under the present circumstances, top policymakers said on Monday. 

 After talks at the Bank for International Settlements, Jean-Claude Trichet, who chairs the bi-monthly Global Economy Meeting, told a briefing: "It was a welcome decision, taking into account the circumstances." The U.S. government seized control of the two mortgage firms on Sunday, launching what could be its biggest bailout ever in U.S. history to support the domestic housing market and ward off more global financial market turbulence. Trichet also said the monetary authorities had the capacity to take appropriate decisions to keep the process orderly. "We have to be continue to be very alert, as clearly the repricing of risks is ongoing. When we are in this posture of alertness, we do what we can do for the process to continue in a way in which is as orderly as possible." Trichet said while the global economy was showing signs of slowing down, inflation remained high, repeating that it was important that all policymakers solidly anchored inflation expectations. The Global Economy Meeting is attended by central bank governors or senior officials of major industrial and emerging market economies. Trichet also chairs the Group of 10 central bankers and is president of the European Central Bank. (Reporting by  Natsuko Waki  and  Sven Egenter , editing by Swaha Pattanaik)
