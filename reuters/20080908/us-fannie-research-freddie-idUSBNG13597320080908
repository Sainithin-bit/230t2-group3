 (Reuters) - The U.S. government finally seized control of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae on Sunday in efforts to calm the economy hit by over a year long credit and housing crisis. 

 As part of the plan, the Treasury is taking an equity stake in the companies, will purchase mortgage-backed securities that the mortgage giants issue and also extend a credit line to them. Government's action is not only expected to stabilize the mortgage markets, but also have major implications for global markets and the nation's banks. Here is a summary of comments from research issued from major brokerages since the announcement: * LADENBURG THALMANN'S RICHARD BOVE "Fannie and Freddie are gone and this is a good thing. They were mismanaged messes with accounting frauds that equaled those of Enron and WorldCom. They were blights on the U.S. government's capital raising ability. Their passing should allow a new system that is less threatening to emerge." "The single largest beneficiary of these events is clearly Bank of America. This company's acquisition of Countrywide Financial will now appear to have been a stroke of brilliance." "The nation's housing program loses. It took 71 years to build and perfect and three years to destroy what was built." * FRIEDMAN BILLINGS RAMSEY'S PAUL MILLER JR "Financials will rally in response to the news, in our opinion, but the duration of the rally will be determined by how low interest rates go and by what extent liquidity moves back into the mortgage market." "Companies that should benefit the most include those with the greatest exposure to the mortgage businesses, including Bank of America, Flagstar, National City, PHH, Wachovia, Washington Mutual, and Wells Fargo." * SANFORD C. BERNSTEIN'S BRAD HINTZ "The immediate impact of this action will be to emphasize to equity investors the fragility of current U.S. credit conditions." "For the brokers, the Government takeover of the GSEs will have only limited effects on revenue." "Bernstein does not expect any material losses for the large capitalization U.S. securities firms arising from this government action." "European Financials should be net beneficiaries in financial terms, as gains from appreciation and lower capital requirements on the GSE debt securities should outweigh any losses on the (generally modest) exposure to the GSE equity classes." "The main direct beneficiaries are likely to be those with large investment banking businesses, namely Deutsche Bank AG, Credit Suisse Group, UBS, RBS and Barclays, along with others with significant U.S. exposure." "Longer term, the decision by the Treasury to place the GSE's into conservatorship is a positive move for the credit markets." * SCOTIA CAPITAL'S STEVE MALYON "In the foreign exchange market, the announcement has given a lift to risk-based trades." "The removal of the uncertainty over the companies' fate will reassure foreign central banks, who have been reducing their exposure to the companies' debt in recent weeks." * CITIGROUP'S BRADLEY BALL "Because the GSEs are in conservatorship, they will no longer be managed with a strategy to maximize common shareholder returns, a strategy which historically encouraged risk-taking." "In light of significant uncertainty surrounding their future structure we give a very low probability that the GSEs emerge from conservatorship as shareholder-owned institutions." * J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES' MICHAEL REHAUT "Government's actions regarding FNM, FRE should have minimal effect on current state of housing market." * FOX-PITT KELTON'S DAVID TRONE "We believe securities firms and the mortgage market in general can now begin to move forward, as the GSE's future is clarified. However, more details need to evolve, and thus we don't see much impact in the short term." * ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND "Existing stock holders lose out, but Treasury has ensured holders of GSE debt and MBS are protected." "Some Eurobanks may have to book losses on pref shares, but most should enjoy revaluation gains." (Compiled by Sweta Singh, Dinesh Nair in Bangalore)
