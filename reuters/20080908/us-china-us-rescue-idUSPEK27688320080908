 BEIJING  (Reuters) - China's central bank said on Monday that Washington's bailout of its ailing mortgage giants Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae was positive because it should be able to stabilize markets and boost confidence. 

 The People's Bank of China also urged the U.S. government to be responsible in maintaining financial market stability, and the protection of investor interests. The bank is paying close attention to the U.S. Treasury's rescue package, it said in the statement posted on its Web site (www.pbc.gov.cn). "The U.S. financial market is closely linked to the stability of the global economy and financial markets. The U.S. government should take responsibility for maintaining financial market stability and protecting investor interests," the bank said in its official response to the emergency bailout. China is the biggest holder of the two lenders' bonds, and Freddie and Fannie bond holders are the most likely long-term beneficiaries of the U.S. government's move which puts existing shareholders last in line in any claims. But as battered financial stocks rallied and investors sold safe-haven bonds, analysts cautioned that the plan announced on Sunday was more a sign of the perilous state of the global financial system than of an imminent recovery.
