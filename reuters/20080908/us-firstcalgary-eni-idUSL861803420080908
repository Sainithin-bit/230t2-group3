 MILAN  (Reuters) - Italy's Eni SpA ( ENI.MI ) has agreed to buy Canada's First Calgary Petroleums Ltd FCP.TO in a cash deal worth C$923 million ($865 million), the latest in a series of acquisitions aimed at boosting its oil and gas reserves. 

 "The transaction is in line with our strategy of increasing our presence in our core countries, acquiring high potential assets," Eni Chief Executive Paolo Scaroni said in a statement on Monday. Eni's stock rose 2.4 percent to 20.74 euros by 6:43 a.m. EDT. Last year, Eni paid 1.74 billion pounds for oil explorer Burren Energy Plc, which produces oil in the Republic of Congo and gas in Turkmenistan. It also bought Maurel & Prom's ( MAUP.PA ) stakes in fields in the Congo for $1.43 billion. With First Calgary, whose main asset is in Algeria, Eni will boost its reserves by about 190 million barrels of oil equivalent (mmboe) on a 2p basis in the country, the statement said. 2p means proven plus probable reserves, an estimate of what the company thinks is likely to be recovered over the life of the fields. First Calgary has a 75 percent stake in a license on the perimeter of Block 405b. Its partner is Algeria's state-run Sonatrach. Production start-up is expected in 2011 with a plateau of Eni's share of production of about 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) by 2012, the statement said. "It gives it (Eni) more leverage in the region," said ING analyst Jason Kenney. Eni has a development and production license with Sonatrach for fields in the Sahara desert. Production from the fields averages about 23,000 barrels boed. Its other activities in the country include the construction of the Transmed gas pipeline across the Mediterranean. UNANIMOUS BOARD APPROVAL Under the deal, Eni is to pay First Calgary shareholders C$3.60 per share and convertible debenture holders $108,000 plus accrued interest for each $100,000 par value of bonds. The deal values the fully diluted share capital of First Calgary at about C$923 million. "It's a good deal ... at a good price," ING's Kenney said. First Calgary's board has voted unanimously to approve the deal, Eni said, adding it expected to close it in late 2008. A group of First Calgary shareholders, directors and officers with about 18.3 percent of the outstanding shares and options have agreed to vote in favour of the deal, it said. First Calgary's stock was halted from trade in Toronto last Wednesday after jumping more than 40 percent or 96 Canadian cents to C$3.32. The company then said it was in talks with parties interested in buying all of it or significant parts of its assets. Earlier this year, First Calgary faced a shareholder revolt that was only quelled after its chief executive quit. Before the deal with Eni, it had been looking for financing to develop Algerian assets. (Editing by  Louise Ireland )
