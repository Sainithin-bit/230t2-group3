 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Home Depot Inc Chief Executive Frank Blake said on Monday a U.S. government bailout of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was needed as the mortgage finance companies would likely have had difficulty funding their obligations. 

 Shares of Home Depot and other home-goods companies rose 5 percent or more on hopes the U.S. Treasury's plan to take control of Fannie and Freddie, which together back about half of the country's mortgages, might put at least a temporary floor under troubled financial markets and help ease the credit crisis. "I think it was a necessary step," Blake said after a breakfast speech before the Cobb County Chamber of Commerce in Atlanta. Home improvement leader Home Depot and industry rivals have been hit by the U.S. housing slump and credit crisis that have forced consumers to cut back on spending. Blake, who had told a Goldman Sachs retail conference last week that the housing market was nearing the bottom of its decline, added that he didn't know if or how the bailout could affect any housing improvement but added "at least we weren't faced with a much worse eventuality." Credit Suisse analyst Gary Balter said in a research note that the move could lead to further rallies in home goods retail stocks, which have been aided recently by falling oil prices. "Oil prices have come down, global economies are slowing, the dollar has strengthened and (second quarter) results showed solid gross margins even as earnings declined," Balter wrote. "The one negative remaining over this group remained credit and we are hopeful that this weekend's actions mark the beginning of a solution to that issue," he added. He also said the government takeover of Fannie and Freddie could lead to lower interest rates. Among home-goods stocks, Home Depot shares were up $1.47, or 5.1 percent, to $30.06, Lowe's Companies was up $1.45, or 5.6 percent, to $27.20, and building products maker Masco Corp was up $1.71, or 9.4 percent, to $19.97. Home furnishings firms Williams-Sonoma and La-Z-Boy Inc gained more than 6 percent. (Reporting by  Karen Jacobs , editing by Dave Zimmerman)
