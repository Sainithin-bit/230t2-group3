 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac debt soared early Monday, hours after the U.S. government's takeover of the two U.S. home funding companies and its explicit backing of the securities. 

 Fannie Mae 30-year 6 percent mortgage securities spreads snapped 18 basis points tighter to 1.735 percentage points over 10-year Treasury notes. Spreads for agency debt securities, issued to fund the companies' mortgage purchase activities, narrowed by at least 20 basis points. One strategist put the yield reduction versus Treasuries in the upper 20 basis-point range. (Reporting by  Lynn Adler  and  Al Yoon , Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
