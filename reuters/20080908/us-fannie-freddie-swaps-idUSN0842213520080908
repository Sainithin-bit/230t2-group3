 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. government's takeover of mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will likely trigger payments on credit default swaps on their debt, analysts said. 

 The government on Sunday seized control of the companies, launching what could be its biggest bailout ever to support the U.S. housing market and ward off more global financial market turbulence. Credit default swaps are used to hedge against the risk of a borrower defaulting on their debt, or to speculate on a companies' credit quality. Terms in the credit default swaps contracts specify that the contracts are triggered by the intervention, meaning that protection sellers must pay buyers the full amount insured. The cost to insure Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's "AAA"-rated senior debt was around 38 basis points on Friday, or $38,000 per year for five years to insure $10 million in debt, according to Markit Intraday. Credit default swaps on the mortgage companies' subordinated debt traded at around 219 basis point on Friday, Markit data showed. (Reporting by  Karen Brettell ; Editing by  Chizu Nomiyama )
