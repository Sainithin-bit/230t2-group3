 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Credit default swaps protecting the debt of mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are expected to be reintroduced with different terms, after payments on existing contracts were triggered by their government bailout, analysts said. 

 The government on Sunday seized control of the companies, launching what could be its biggest bailout ever to support the U.S. housing market and ward off more global financial market turbulence. Credit default swaps written on the agencies' debt were triggered by the action, meaning the contracts must be paid out even though the underlying bonds will continue to be repaid. With $1.6 trillion in debt outstanding between Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, new contracts protecting the bonds against default will likely start trading, analysts said. "New CDS contracts without the conservatorship trigger should begin to trade," analysts at Barclays Capital said in a report. Another market player who declined to be named said new contracts are "in the works." Credit default swaps are used to hedge against the risk of a borrower defaulting on their debt, or to speculate on a company's credit quality. The most common credit default swap trigger is when a borrower defaults on its debt though some contracts, such as those written on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's debt, can be paid out on changes of control, or in this case, a conservatorship. "There will undoubtedly be much discussion about where (Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) CDS should trade in this new environment," Barclays analysts Vince Breitenbach and Jeff Meli said in the report. The cost to insure Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's "AAA"-rated senior debt was around 38 basis points on Friday, or $38,000 per year for five years to insure $10 million in debt, according to Markit Intraday. Credit default swaps on the mortgage companies' subordinated debt traded at around 219 basis points on Friday, Markit data showed. Trade association the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) said on Monday it will create a protocol that includes a process to set the value of existing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac default swaps in an auction to simplify their settlement. The swaps are expected to recover close to their par value due to the high trading levels of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's debt. (Reporting by  Karen Brettell )
