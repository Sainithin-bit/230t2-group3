 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The White House said on Monday that the administration's rescue plan for troubled mortgage finance agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was necessary to prevent broader financial damage and was structured to limit costs to taxpayers. 

 "These are congressionally chartered companies so the government is involved in these companies whether we liked it or not," White House spokeswoman Dana Perino told a press briefing. "The whole system was at risk, not only in our country but affecting global markets," she said. (Reporting by  Mark Felsenthal ; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
