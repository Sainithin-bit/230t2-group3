 (Reuters) - The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) pumped oil at around 32.82 million barrels per day (bpd) in August, according to a Reuters survey. 

 -OPEC has informal production targets for 12 of its 13 members. Iraq is the exception. -The twelve members produced at 30.46 million bpd in August, or 790,000 bpd above target. The collective ceiling for the 12 is 29.67 bpd. -Top oil exporter Saudi Arabia was the highest above its target, at 9.65 million bpd versus a target of 8.943 million bpd. -Iran, UAE, Kuwait, Algeria, Angola and Qatar were also above their mark. -OPEC targets are contentious. Members' targets for all except Iraq, Angola and Ecuador were published briefly on OPEC's website last year and subsequently withdrawn without explanation. -Iran disputes its target, and says that it never agreed on the level calculated. -Venezuela claims to produce more oil than analysts and industry observers say it does. Venezuela says production is around 3.2 million bpd. Those surveyed by Reuters pegged output in August at 2.36 million bpd. It has an informal target of 2.47 million bpd. -OPEC uses third party estimates to calculate its own output. -New members Angola and Ecuador received limits from January 1, 2008.
