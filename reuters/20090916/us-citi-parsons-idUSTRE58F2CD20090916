 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Richard Parsons, the chairman of Citigroup Inc ( C.N ), is joining Providence Equity Partners as a senior adviser, the Rhode Island-based private equity firm said on Wednesday. 

 Parsons, also the former chairman and chief executive of Time Warner ( TWX.N ), will continue to serve as chairman of Citigroup, which will remain his primary business activity. Citigroup spokeswoman Shannon Bell said in a statement that Parsons' advisory role will not require any day-to-day operational work or oversight. "His primary business activity absolutely will remain with Citi," Bell said. Providence said in a statement that Parsons will advise the firm on new investment opportunities and on existing investments.
