 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Twitter is closing a round of funding which will value the company known for its 140-character stream-of-conscious blogs at $1 billion, technology news site TechCrunch reported on Wednesday. 

 The company will raise around $50 million, and Chief Executive Evan Williams told employees about the funding round, TechCrunch said, citing multiple unnamed sources. Twitter and other social networking sites have been hard-pressed to show that they are viable businesses, despite wild popularity, and that they have what it takes to eventually make a successful public offering or private sale. The Twitter funding news would raise the industry's credibility with investors, as did a Tuesday announcement from Facebook that it was making enough money to cover expenses. Twitter's Tweets are 140-character dispatches, and the service has become a phenomenon among news junkies, Hollywood watchers -- and many investors. Twitter did not immediately respond to a call seeking comment. (Reporting by  Alexei Oreskovic  and  Peter Henderson ; Editing Bernard Orr)
