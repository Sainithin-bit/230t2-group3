 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - White House spokesman Jay Carney on Wednesday welcomed a vote by the U.S. House of Representatives that passed an extension of borrowing authority under the federal debt limit. 
 Carney reiterated that the Obama administration would have preferred a longer extension to avoid continued uncertainty over the issue. (Reporting by  Jeff Mason ; Editing by  Sandra Maler )
