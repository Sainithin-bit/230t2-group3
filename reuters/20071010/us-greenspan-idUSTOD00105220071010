 TORONTO  (Reuters) - Former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said on Wednesday that not all of the Canadian dollar's rise to parity with the U.S. dollar was caused by U.S. dollar weakness. 

 "There has been some fall in the U.S. dollar, but nothing even remotely related to how rapidly the Canadian dollar has surged," Greenspan said in an interview broadcast on CBC radio. "What has effectively impacted Canada's loonie is essentially a dramatic increase in demand for what it is you produce. Prices have risen and notably, as a consequence so has the exchange rate."
