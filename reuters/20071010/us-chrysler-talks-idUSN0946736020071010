 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Chrysler and the United Auto Workers union continued labor negotiations into Wednesday despite the expiration of the extension of their current contract, a source close to the talks told Reuters. 

 In a letter to UAW local officials, union President Ron Gettelfinger said the indefinite contract extension with the company would end at 11:59 p.m. Tuesday, and Chrysler workers would go on strike unless the "basis for a tentative agreement" was reached by 11 a.m. on Wednesday. Talks at Chrysler's Auburn Hills, Michigan, headquarters ran until almost 4 a.m. on Tuesday. They resumed later in the day and ran straight through into the early hours of Wednesday.
