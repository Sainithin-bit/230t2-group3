 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Local officials of the United Auto Workers union said on Wednesday they were preparing to strike Chrysler LLC, with less than an hour to go before a union deadline for agreement on a new labor contract. 

 Officials at Chrysler's St. Louis, Missouri, and Sterling Heights, Michigan, plants were making detailed preparations to get workers out of job sites and onto picket lines. With the UAW's 11 a.m. strike deadline looming, the union and the automaker remained in high-level talks at Chrysler's Auburn Hills, Michigan, headquarters, a person briefed on the talks said. The bargaining session was in its 25th consecutive hour. (Reporting by  Poornima Gupta )
