 PORTLAND, Maine  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Bank of Boston President Eric Rosengren on Wednesday said financial markets have improved over the past month although securitized products may continue to see some difficulty until investor confidence is restored. 

 In his first public speech since taking office in July, Rosengren said investors were not reassessing risk in a wholesale way, noting that emerging market debt and stock markets had been little affected despite the fallout in short-term debt markets. "This is consistent with liquidity problems rather than a change in the willingness to hold risky assets in general," he said in a speech to the Portland Community Chamber. The text of his remarks was made available in advance. Rosengren is a voting member of the Fed's rate-setting committee this year.
