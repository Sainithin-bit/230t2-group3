 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The credit crunch that has troubled financial markets in recent months will restrain the U.S. and global economies, but odds of a recession are less than 50 percent, monetary experts said on Wednesday. 

 Leaked reports of the International Monetary Fund's upcoming growth forecasts showed the IMF has revised down 2008 projections for the United States economy to 1.9 percent, compared with 2.8 percent it expected for the U.S. in July. The officials said financial market conditions had improved and that repercussions of the recent market turmoil should be contained. Fed Bank of Boston President Eric Rosengren said while financial market conditions have improved over the past month, there might be some continued difficulty in securitized products until investor confidence is restored. Rosengren said investors had not reassessed risk in a wholesale way, noting that emerging market debt and stock markets had been little affected despite the fallout in short-term debt markets. "This is consistent with liquidity problems rather than a change in the willingness to hold risky assets in general," he told the Portland Community Chamber. International Monetary Fund chief economist Simon Johnson echoed that view on Wednesday in Washington, saying that the repercussions from recent market turmoil should be contained within advanced economies, with growth in emerging markets likely to remain broadly on track. "The global expansion should continue albeit at a somewhat slower pace," Johnson said. The IMF reduced its forecast for world growth next year to 4.8 percent from a previous forecast of 5.2 percent. In a similar vein, British finance minister Alistair Darling said he had downgraded the government's economic forecasts because of problems stemming from the U.S. economy, but was optimistic Britain would weather the storm well. In his first prebudget report, Darling cut his growth forecast for next year to 2.0 to 2.5 percent from the 2.5 to 3.0 percent range the government had predicted in March. IMF economist Johnson said the recent turmoil in credit and money markets had provided a major test for global financial stability and added that the risks were not over yet. "Events remain fluid," Johnson said. BANKS WELL CAPITALIZED, ABLE TO PROVIDE FUNDS The Boston Fed's Rosengren said that banks were well capitalized and they should continue providing funds. "It will be important for banks to provide their usual role as a provider of liquidity in times of distress," he said. A downturn in the U.S. mortgage market triggered a global tightening of credit conditions in early August. Central banks worldwide responded with massive injections of liquidity into the banking system to prevent money markets from freezing up and the Fed cut interest rates sharply in an attempt to limit economic damage from the credit crunch and market disarray. Speaking in New York, former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, said U.S. home prices would almost certainly fall and that the slump will eventually prompt consumers to cut back spending. Consumer spending accounts for some 60 percent of the overall U.S. economy. But Greenspan said that rising stock prices, which pushed major indexes to record highs this week, could help offset the drop in the value of home equity. RATINGS AGENCIES, DUE DILIGENCE Rosengren said that investors, particularly in Europe and Asia, had relied too much on rating agencies as they scooped up highly rated securitized instruments without knowing the underlying securities, which included subprime issues. Subprime loans are made to borrowers with poor credit histories. "Investors basically delegated due diligence to the rating agencies," he said. Rating agencies themselves have come under fire and will likely be reviewed as financial authorities assess steps to be taken in the wake of the recent turmoil. "The rating process deserves a fair amount of scrutiny," Rosengren said.
