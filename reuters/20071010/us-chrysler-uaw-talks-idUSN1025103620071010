 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Negotiators from Chrysler LLC and the United Auto Workers union broke off talks on Wednesday afternoon, a person briefed on the talks said. 

 It was not immediately clear when talks would resume. A spokesperson for the UAW was not immediately available for comment. Chrysler declined to comment. UAW workers walked out of some Chrysler plants on Wednesday at 11 a.m. ET, triggering the industry's second major work stoppage in as many weeks.
