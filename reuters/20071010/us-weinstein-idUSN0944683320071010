 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Movie mogul Harvey Weinstein on Tuesday said he hopes to see big returns in Asia and from animation for the Weinstein Co, formed two years ago with brother Bob. 

 Since leaving Disney with great fanfare to start their own studio with over $1 billion raised through Goldman Sachs, the Weinsteins have had a few disappointing movies, like "Grindhouse" for example. But Harvey Weinstein, who has had hits with "Sicko" and "1408," appeared upbeat at a PriceWaterhouse media conference on Tuesday discussing the company's diversification into Asia, social networking, fashion and video games. He said he hopes some of these efforts will yield the kind of returns his brother -- who has had successful horror films like "Scream," -- gets with less art house but more commercial fare like "Scary Movie 4" produced under the company's Dimension label, which he runs. "Bob doesn't win Oscars, but he gets 22 percent to 24 percent return on investment," Harvey Weinstein said. "Two areas I'm hoping to do that in would be in either animation or Asia," he said. Including titles released by MGM Inc, the Weinstein Co's domestic box office for 2006 was $311 million, second among independents to Lions Gate Entertainment ( LGF.N ). As of last week, the Weinstein Co's domestic box office hit nearly $270 million this year, according to a spokeswoman. Its investments in social networking community aSmallWorld.net, cable network Ovation, and home video distributor Genius Products have helped diversify its revenue stream away from Hollywood's hit-obsessed infrastructure. In August, the company also launched a $285 million fund to finance more than two-dozen Asian-themed films over the next six years. But even though Harvey Weinstein was using Wall Street terminology, like return on investment, the man best known as an Oscar impresario for producing such movies as "Shakespeare in Love," "Pulp Fiction," "and "Trainspotting," said great filmmaking still remained his priority. "The film company is the most important part of the company," he said. He predicted a market contraction to come as private equity investment diminishes. "It seemed like six months ago, private equity firms had so much, they just wanted to park it somewhere. There will be some winners and losers and production will be diminished," he said. But he said that a contraction in the area of specialty films may not be a bad thing. "When you start to look at the numbers, there was so much competition. I hope the market rights itself," he said. MGM is owned by a consortium of companies including private equity firms Texas Pacific Group and Providence Equity Partners, Sony Corp ( 6758.T ) and Comcast Corp ( CMCSA.O ).
