 DETROIT  (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers chief negotiator with Chrysler LLC has told union local leaders that a strike effective at 11 a.m. ET on Wednesday will make exception for five of the automaker's plants. 

 A memo from UAW Vice President General Holiefield on Wednesday said that the strike would not target the five plants. A copy of the memo was made available to Reuters. The five plants that would be outside the union's strike target were identified as Belvidere, Illinois; Conner Avenue and Jefferson North assembly plants in Detroit; an assembly plant in Newark, Delaware; and Warren Truck outside Detroit.
