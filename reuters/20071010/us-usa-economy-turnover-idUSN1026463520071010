 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. workers were reluctant to shift jobs in August, according to government data released on Wednesday that showed the percentage of employees in the labor force that left their jobs hit a 16-month low. 

 Job separations, a measure that covers all terminations of employment, dipped slightly to 3.2 percent in August, from a revised 3.3 percent the previous month, said the Labor Department. The separations rate was the lowest since April 2006, even though separations in the finance industry shot higher. The quits rate, a subset of total separations which can serve as a barometer of workers' ability to change jobs, was unchanged in August at 1.9 percent for the fifth straight month. Quits, a component of total separations, a measure that covers all terminations of employment, accounted for 58 percent of the separations rate. Companies have been showing a reluctance to lay off workers at the same time they are apprehensive about hiring new ones, economists have said. The job openings rate was unchanged at 2.9 percent for the second straight month while the hires rate fell slightly to 3.4 percent from 3.5 percent in July. Over the 12 months through August, finance and insurance categories had increases in the job openings, hires and quits rate, according to the report. On a not seasonally adjusted basis, the rate of job openings in financial activities rose to 3.3 percent from 3.1 percent in July, while the hires rate rose to 2.7 percent from 2.6 percent in the previous month. The rate of total separations in financial activities jumped to 3.4 percent in August from 2.4 percent the prior month, while the quits rate rose to 2.3 percent from 1.3 percent in July. The Labor Department's Job Openings and Labor Turnover survey lags many job market gauges but it can provide additional insight on labor market dynamics.
