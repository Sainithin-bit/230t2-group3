 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Boeing Co's ( BA.N ) announcement that first deliveries of its 787 Dreamliner will be delayed by at least six months will affect a number of corporations across the world. 

 As plane deliveries are moved back, suppliers may find revenues from parts it sells to Boeing are shifted backward. Airlines may have problems finding replacement planes while waiting for 787s, but may also be entitled to compensation from Boeing. The following is a list of key suppliers, customers and rivals that are most likely to feel a financial impact from the delay. SUPPLIERS -- Japanese textile firm Toray Industries ( 3402.T ), which is supplying the carbon-composite fiber making up around half the 787's main structure -- General Electric Co ( GE.N ) and Britain's Rolls-Royce ( RR.L ), which are making the plane's engines -- Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd ( 7011.T ), Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd ( 7012.T ) and Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd ( 7270.T ), which are building key parts of the carbon composite fuselage, wing box and wing -- Spirit Aerosystems ( SPR.N ), which is building fuselage and wing parts -- Honeywell International Inc ( HON.N ) and Rockwell Collins Inc ( COL.N ), which are supplying flight control electronics, navigation systems and displays -- Hamilton Sundstrand, a unit of United Technologies Corp ( UTX.N ), which is making the plane's internal power systems -- Global Aeronautica, which is putting together parts of the fuselage in South Carolina. The company is a joint venture between Alenia, a unit of Italian aerospace group Finmeccanica ( SIFI.MI ), and Vought Aircraft Industries Inc., which is majority-owned by private equity firm Carlyle Group CYL.UL CUSTOMERS -- Japan's All Nippon Airways ( 9202.T ), which placed the first order, for 50 787s, in July 2004. -- Other large customers include International Lease Finance Corp. ( AIG.N ), Qantas Airways Ltd ( QAN.AX ), Air Canada ( ACa.TO ), Japan Airlines 9205.T, Air India AI.UL and Continental Airlines CAL.N RIVALS -- Airbus, a unit of European aerospace group EADS ( EAD.PA ), may see renewed interest in its A350 XWB (extra wide body) plane, its planned rival to the 787 Sources: Reuters/Boeing (Reporting by  Bill Rigby )
