 PORTLAND, Maine  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Bank of Boston President Eric Rosengren on Wednesday said a weaker dollar was a potential concern for inflation but that a lower currency did have some advantages. 

 "There is the potential concern if the dollar depreciates significantly," he said in response to a question after a speech, but added the pass-through effect was not so great in the United States as foreign importers priced costs to the dollar rather than their local currencies. A weaker dollar also had some advantages for the U.S. economy as it helped exporters be more competitive, he also said.
