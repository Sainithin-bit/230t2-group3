 DETROIT  (Reuters) - The Teamsters union said on Wednesday it would honor the United Auto Workers strike against Chrysler LLC, saying its members would not cross or work behind UAW picket lines. 

 "Until the strike ends, our 10,000 carhaul members will be out there honoring the picket lines by not crossing or working behind the lines," said Fred Zuckerman, Director of the Teamsters Carhaul Division.
