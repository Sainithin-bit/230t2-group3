 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - Oil services company Weatherford International Inc ( WFT.N ) said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday that the U.S. Justice Department was probing its participation in the oil-for-food program in Iraq. 

 Houston-based Weatherford had already been under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for its involvement in the United Nations program, as disclosed in the company's 2006 annual report filed with regulators. In the latest filing, Weatherford said the SEC has now subpoenaed certain documents related its oil-for-food probe. The company, which helps energy companies drill for oil, said it was cooperating fully. A spokesman for Weatherford was not immediately available for comment, but the filing said the company had hired lawyers to investigate the matter. The oil-for-food program was established to help Saddam Hussein's Iraq sell oil to buy humanitarian supplies while it was otherwise under U.N. sanctions due to its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. A U.N.-commissioned probe found the program was corrupted by 2,200 companies in 66 countries that paid $1.8 billion in kickbacks to Iraqi official to win supply deals. Last month Weatherford said its foreign subsidies would discontinue doing business in countries that are subject to U.S. economic and trade sanctions, including Cuba, Iran, Sudan and Syria. Shares of Weatherford closed up 3 percent, or $1.95, at $65.07 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by  Anna Driver )
