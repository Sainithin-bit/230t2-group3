 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Agricultural company Monsanto Co ( MON.N ) said on Wednesday it expects the fiscal first quarter of 2008 to be better than the same period last year, due mostly to strong sales of its Roundup herbicides in Latin America. 

 The company also said, on a conference call with analysts, the bulk of its earnings in 2008 should come in the second and third quarters, with a loss in the fourth quarter. (Reporting by  Martinne Geller )
