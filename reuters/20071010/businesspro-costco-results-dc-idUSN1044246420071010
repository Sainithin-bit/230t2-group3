 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Costco Wholesale Corp ( COST.O ), the 
No. 1 U.S. warehouse club operator, said on Wednesday its 
quarterly profit rose about 5 percent, helped by stronger 
sales. 

  Net income increased to $372.4 million, or 83 cents per 
share, in the fourth quarter ended on September 2, from $355.6 
million, or 75 cents per share, a year earlier.  The 2007 results included non-cash costs of 8 cents a share 
related to deferred membership revenue liability.  Net sales rose to $20.09 billion from $19.5 billion. 
Including membership fees, total revenue in the current year 
period was $20.5 billion.  Analysts had expected a profit of 83 cents a share, on 
revenue of $20.6 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.  Costco customers pay an annual membership fee to shop at 
the retailer's stores, which sell everything from toilet paper 
to diamond rings.  The company said sales at stores open at least a year, or 
same-store sales, rose 5 percent during the quarter from a year 
earlier. Analysts on average were expecting a 4.7 percent 
increase, according to Reuters Estimates.  Costco operates 520 stores, including 385 in the United 
States and Puerto Rico. It plans to open 10 or 11 new 
warehouses this year.  (Reporting by  Dane Hamilton  and  Franklin Paul )
