 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Agricultural company Monsanto Co ( MON.N ) posted a wider-than-expected loss on Wednesday and forecast fiscal 2008 earnings below Wall Street estimates, sending its shares down more than 4 percent in premarket trading. 

 Monsanto, which sells genetically modified seeds, said its net loss widened to $210 million, or 39 cents per share, in the fourth quarter that ended August 31, from $144 million, or 27 cents per share, a year earlier. The results included a $186 million in-process research and development charge at its Delta and Pine Land cotton business. On an ongoing basis, the St. Louis-based company said its loss was 18 cents per share. Analysts on average were expecting a loss of 17 cents, excluding items, according to Reuters Estimates. Net sales rose to $1.57 billion from $1.39 billion, helped by a strong end to the corn season in the United States and higher corn seed revenue from Argentina and Brazil. Monsanto said it expected fiscal 2008 earnings of $2.20 to $2.40 per share. Analysts on average had forecast $2.50, according to Reuters Estimates. The company experienced strong growth this year in sales of its genetically modified corn, engineered to help farmers fight weeds and insects, as demand for biofuels and exports drove expansion of corn acres. But the fourth quarter is typically slow as U.S. farmers focus on harvesting of row crops. Monsanto shares fell to $85.75 before the opening bell from their close of $89.52 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by  Martinne Geller )
