 (Reuters) - Boeing Co ( BA.N ) said its planned initial deliveries of the 787 Dreamliner will be delayed by six months due to continued challenges completing assembly of the first airplanes. 

 The company said it does not expect any material impact to its earnings and that its earnings outlook for 2007 and 2008 remained unchanged. The deliveries of the Dreamliner are expected to begin in late November or December 2008, versus the original target of May 2008, the company said in a statement.
