 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Software company BEA Systems BEAS.O on Wednesday raised its estimate for a pretax charge it will take in connection with a review of its stock options accounting to approximately $425 million. 

 The company had previously said it expected a non-cash compensation expense of $340 million to $390 million, before taxes, as it restates financial results from fiscal 1998 through the first quarter of fiscal 2007. The revised estimate issued on Wednesday includes about $175 million for employee severance arrangements and $250 million to correct stock measurement dates for stock options grants. BEA sells software that helps business computer systems communicate with each other. (Reporting by  Michele Gershberg )
