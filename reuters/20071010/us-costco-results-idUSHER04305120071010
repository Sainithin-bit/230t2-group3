 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Costco Wholesale Corp ( COST.O ) reported a better-than-expected rise in quarterly profit on Wednesday as margins improved, and the No. 1 U.S. warehouse club operator said September sales at stores open at least a year were stronger than Wall Street forecasts. 

 Costco shares rose as much as 10.4 percent to a lifetime high of $69.95 on Nasdaq. The September sales results marked a rebound from August, when it reported weaker-than-expected sales, hurt by a decline in store traffic that it attributed to extremely high temperatures in California. "It was a nice bounce-back from a weak August," said Mitchell Kaiser, a retail analyst at Piper Jaffray, adding that Costco continues to take market share as consumers consolidate shopping trips. "They're certainly a destination, and you can go there, it can be a one-stop shop, and you get great value at a very reasonable price," he said. "That resonates with consumers." The company said net income rose to $372.4 million, or 83 cents per share, in the fiscal fourth quarter ended on September 2, from $355.6 million, or 75 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding a one-time charge of 8 cents a share related to how it recognizes membership fees, earnings were 91 cents per share. Analysts, on average, had been expecting 83 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Charles Grom, a retail analyst with JP Morgan, said Costco delivered its best quarterly gross profit margin performance in five years, "driving significant, high-quality earnings-per-share outperformance." Its quarterly gross margins rose to 10.74 percent from 10.36 percent a year earlier, an improvement analysts attributed in part to a shift in Costco's return policy. Earlier this year, the retailer implemented a new 90-day return policy on consumer electronics to cut down on customers returning old items after purchasing newer models. IMPROVING SALES Investors are watching retail sales closely to see how consumer spending holds up as the crucial holiday selling season approaches. Late last month, Target Corp ( TGT.N ), the No. 2 U.S. discount retail chain behind Wal-Mart, cut its September sales forecast. Children's Place Retail Stores Inc ( PLCE.O ) slashed its third-quarter earnings forecast on Tuesday, saying price cuts hurt its margins. Most major U.S. retail chains will report their September sales on October 11. Costco said same-store sales, at outlets open at least a year, rose 5 percent during the fourth quarter from the year-ago period. For September, total sales at its clubs open at least a year rose 6 percent. while analysts on average were expecting a 4.7 percent increase, according to Reuters Estimates. Its September international same-store sales jumped 13 percent, while U.S. same-store sales rose 4 percent. Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti said on a conference call that the September sales were a "nice comeback" from August, helped by improved traffic and customers spending more in its clubs during their visits. Third-quarter net sales rose to $20.09 billion from $19.5 billion a year earlier. Including membership fees, revenue was $20.5 billion. Costco customers pay an annual membership fee to shop at the retailer's stores, which sell everything from toilet paper to diamond rings. For its current fiscal year, Galanti forecast earnings per share in the "high $2.80's" to $3.00, while analysts, on average, are expecting $2.90. For its first quarter, he said analysts' consensus estimate of 59 cents per share is a "shade" too high. His forecast is in the mid- to high-50 cent range. Costco operates 520 warehouse club stores, including 385 in the United States and Puerto Rico, and 71 in Canada. Galanti said the warehouse club operator, which also has clubs in the United Kingdom, Korea, Taiwan, Japan and Mexico, will be entering Australia in the upcoming year. Costco's stock rose $5.62, or 8.9 percent, to $68.94 early Wednesday afternoon. (Additional reporting by  Dane Hamilton  and  Franklin Paul )
