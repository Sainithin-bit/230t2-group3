 TORONTO  (Reuters) - Former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said on Wednesday that demographic shifts will strain U.S. Medicare resources but that financing the Iraq war would have no long-term impact on those resources. 

 "We do not have the resources in any credible economic scenario to fulfill what is currently on the books as an entitlement 10, 15, 20 years from now," he said in an interview broadcast on CBC radio. Greenspan said the cost of the U.S. war in Iraq would have no long-term impact on Medicare funding. He said both political parties were afraid to confront the issue of Medicare's long-term solvency because of its political sensitivity.
