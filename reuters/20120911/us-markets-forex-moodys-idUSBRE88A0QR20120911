 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The dollar sold off across the board on Tuesday after Moody's Investors Service said the United States could lose its triple-A debt rating if next year's budget talks do not result in a lower debt to GDP ratio. 
 The euro hit a four-month high of $1.2836, its highest since May 15, while the dollar index .DXY fell below the key 80 area, a four-month low. (Reporting by  Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss ; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
