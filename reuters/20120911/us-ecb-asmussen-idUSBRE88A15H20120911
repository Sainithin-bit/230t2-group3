 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - The European Central Bank should not succumb to the temptation of buying paper with longer remaining maturities than three years, if it activates its new bond-buying program, policymaker Joerg Asmussen said on Tuesday. 
 "This is the part of the maturity structure that is closer to standard monetary policy operations," said Asmussen, a former German deputy finance minister and since January a member of the ECB's Executive Board. "I think we should limit ourselves to the short end, especially between one and three years," he said in a question-and-answer session after a speech at the University of Frankfurt.
