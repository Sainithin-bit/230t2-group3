 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Rite Aid Corp's ( RAD.N ) sales rose over the most recent quarter, supported by a late flu season, but the company on Thursday forecast another loss this fiscal year despite the expectation of additional sales gains. 

 Sales at its established drugstores were $6.46 billion, down slightly from a year ago as the chain has closed some weaker stores. Rite Aid reported a rare increase in sales at stores open at least a year, partly due to a 1 percent increase in general merchandise sales. That contrasts with declines in recent quarters, as the drugstore chain has lost business to larger rivals Walgreen Co ( WAG.N ) and CVS Caremark ( CVS.N ). Rite Aid said it expects sales at established drugstores to rise between 0.5 percent and 2 percent for the fiscal year that began in late February. But it has not gotten off to a good start. March same-store sales slid 0.1 percent, compared with Walgreen's 3 percent rise. Prescriptions make up two-thirds of Rite Aid's quarterly sales. Chief Executive John Standley said on a conference call that its prescriptions filled had become more profitable due to the introduction of more generic drugs and loyalty cards that have attracted more customers. The third-largest U.S. drugstore operator reported a net loss of $205.7 million, or 24 cents per share, compared with a loss of $208.4 million, or 24 cents per share, for the same quarter a year ago, in line with analyst estimates, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Rite Aid expects a first full-year loss of between $370 million and $560 million, or 42 cents and 64 cents per share. Raymond James analyst John Ransom said Rite-Aid's forecast "shows little to no growth in the business" and said a slow economy and lack of new generic drugs will continue to weigh on the chain. Its shares rose 2.8 percent, or about 3 cents, to $1.09 in early trading. (Reporting by Phil Wahba; Editing by  Derek Caney  and Maureen Bavdek)
