 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co ( WFC.N ) said on Thursday it is shedding about 1,900 jobs, or less than 1 percent of its total workforce, as mortgage refinancings slow. 

 The San Francisco-based lender said notices went out March 23 giving the employees 60 days to find new jobs. Some will be reassigned in the company, spokesman Jason Menke said. A majority of the jobs were temporary, created last year when refinancings surged due to record-low interest rates. "They were hired during the last several months to assist us with application volumes," Menke said. "We had seen a significant increase in demand for mortgage refinancings throughout 2010." "Interest rates were favorable by historical standards," Menke said. "Interest rates have edged up a bit. That's part of it." The layoffs are occurring in Wells Fargo locations across the United States, Menke said, and affect about 3 percent of Wells Fargo's total mortgage staff of 52,000.
