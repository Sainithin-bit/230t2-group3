 (Reuters) - Portugal's decision to seek European financial aid removes a cloud of uncertainty over the euro zone and raises hopes of ending the spread of debt market crises in the region. 

 Here are some facts about Portugal: * THE ECONOMY: -- The government said last week that Portugal overshot its budget deficit goal after Europe's statistics agency insisted on changes to calculations to include losses at three state-run transport companies and a nationalized bank. -- The changes took last year's deficit to 8.6 percent of gross domestic product versus a 7.3 percent target. -- The government still targets cutting the deficit further to 4.6 percent in 2011, 3 percent in 2012 and then to 2 percent in 2013. -- It estimates the economy will shrink 0.9 percent due to austerity measures including higher taxes and wage cuts, after growth of 1.4 percent in 2010. -- The country's budget deficit for 2011 is projected at 10.5 billion euros ($15.01 billion). Portugal's public debt reached 92.4 percent in 2010 and is expected to end 2011 at 97.3 percent of GDP. -- In total, Lisbon has to redeem around a total of around 9 billion euros in April and June, with the total payments including coupons reaching 12 billion euros. -- The number of unemployed in Portugal rose to 11.1 percent in the fourth quarter from 10.9 percent in the previous three months and economists see no prospect of an improvement soon. -- Public sector workers, around 670,000, account for about 13 percent of the employed workforce. -- Major industries in Portugal are automobiles, auto parts, textiles, shoes and tourism. Portugal's annual output of 157,000 tonnes of cork is just over half of the world's total. Agriculture employs some 11 per cent of the workforce, industry 28 percent, and services 61 percent. * POLITICS: -- Bloodless army-led revolution in 1974 ended 48 years of rightist dictatorship. Portugal joined the European Union in 1986. -- The last parliamentary elections on September 27, 2009 were won by Prime Minister Jose Socrates' Socialist Party. Although re-elected, the Socialists lost the absolute majority they had enjoyed in parliament since 2005, with the loss of 24 (from 121 to 97) of the house's 230 seats. They have dropped in popularity since presenting austerity bills. -- Portugal held a presidential election on January 23, 2011 reelecting Anibal Cavaco Silva, a former prime minister from the center-right Social Democratic party. -- Socrates resigned on March 23 after parliament rejected his government's latest austerity package and parliament was subsequently dissolved. -- The president called a snap general election for June 5. The Social Democrats are running ahead in polls, but short of winning an absolute majority. Recent surveys have shown their lead on the Socialists narrowing.
