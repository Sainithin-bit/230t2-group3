 (Reuters) - The White House and Congress have until midnight on Friday to agree to a budget bill or there will be a partial shutdown of the government. 

 Republicans and Democrats say they want to avoid a shutdown, which could idle hundreds of thousands of federal workers, close national parks and Washington's Smithsonian Institution's museum complex. If there is no deal, many official websites would darken and furloughed government workers would be required to power down their BlackBerries at 12.01 a.m. on Saturday. The federal work force numbers about 4.4 million, including members of the U.S. military.
