 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid said on Thursday that he would be happy to pass a short-term spending bill to avoid a government shutdown that contains no policy restrictions or spending cuts. 

 Reid said he was beginning to question whether House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner, the top Republican in the U.S. Congress, really wants a budget deal that would prevent a shutdown on Friday. (Reporting by  Andy Sullivan ; Editing by  Will Dunham )
