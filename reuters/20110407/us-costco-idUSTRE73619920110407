 (Reuters) - Warehouse club operator Costco Wholesale Corp ( COST.O ) beat forecasts with a 13 percent rise in March same-store sales, helped by strong foreign currencies and higher gasoline prices. 

 The largest U.S. warehouse club company posted an increase of 13 percent in stores open at least a year, compared with a forecast for 7.4 percent, according to Thomson Reuters Data. The company posted an increase of 17 percent in same-store sales at its international segment, while the U.S. segment sales grew 11 percent.
