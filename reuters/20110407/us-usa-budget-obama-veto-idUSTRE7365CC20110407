 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President Barack Obama would veto a Republican proposal for a limited stopgap funding bill to finance the U.S. Department of Defense for the rest of fiscal 2011, the White House said on Thursday. 

 "This bill is a distraction from the real work that would bring us closer to a reasonable compromise for funding the remainder of fiscal year 2011 and avert a disruptive federal government shutdown," the White House said in a statement. (Reporting by  Alister Bull ; Editing by  Patricia Zengerle )
