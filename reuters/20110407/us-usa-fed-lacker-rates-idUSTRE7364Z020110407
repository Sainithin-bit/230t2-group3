 ROANOKE, Virginia  (Reuters) - The U.S. economy is recovering well, raising inflation risks that could force the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates before the end of the year, Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker said on Thursday. 

 "Rate hikes by year end are certainly a possible outcome given what we see with momentum in economic growth and given how inflation risks seem to have evolved," Lacker, an inflation hawk, told reporters after a speech. He argued that inflation risks have picked up in the last six months, and that central bank officials need to remain vigilant that the rise does not gain further traction. Lacker said he had still not made up his mind on the ideal course of action when the Fed does begin removing some of the extraordinary stimulus it offered the economy in the wake of the most severe financial meltdown in generations. He did however say selling some of the Fed's mortgage-backed securities, something recently proposed by Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser, was a good idea. "The housing finance market can easily withstand a substantial liquidation of our MBS holdings," Lacker said. In response to the crisis and the ensuing recession, the Fed has bought well over $2 trillion in mortgage and government bonds. Lacker favors a return to holding only Treasuries, since he worries that the housing bond buys blurred the line between monetary and fiscal policy. The U.S. economy expanded 3.1 percent in the fourth quarter, a solid clip but not enough for a country still digging its way out of a deep hole. The U.S. unemployment rate has come down rather rapidly in recent months, but remains at an elevated 8.8 percent.
