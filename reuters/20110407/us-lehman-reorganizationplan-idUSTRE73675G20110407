 BANGALORE/NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A U.S. official who oversees bankruptcies is seeking information about alternative plans to reorganize Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEHMQ.PK and pay roughly $60 billion to the bank's creditors. 

 Once Wall Street's fourth-largest investment bank, Lehman went bankrupt on September 15, 2008, with $639 billion of assets. The bankruptcy is by far the largest in U.S. history. U.S. Trustee Tracy Hope Davis said in a filing that procedures set up to help Lehman creditors decide whether to support a reorganization "do not appear to completely adhere to the requirements" of federal bankruptcy and other laws. She asked Judge James Peck, who oversees Lehman's bankruptcy, to fix the procedures to let her fully participate, and as necessary review documents filed under seal. Changes are needed to streamline the process for creditors and ensure that the public has appropriate access to court documents, the trustee added. Davis made her request the same day that creditors including Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) and Silver Point Capital LP said they were considering whether to file their own reorganization plan for Lehman. Two other proposed plans have already been filed: one by Lehman, and one by bondholders including the hedge fund Paulson & Co and the California Public Employees' Retirement System. Last week, the Paulson-CalPERS group asked Peck to consider its reorganization plan for Lehman at the same time he considers Lehman's plan. The plans differ in how much various creditors would be paid. In March, Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ) said it was part of a creditor group that might also file a reorganization plan for Lehman. The case is In re: Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York, No. 08-13555.
