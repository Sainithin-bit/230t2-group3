 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Jamie Dimon, Chief Executive Officer of the second-largest U.S. bank by assets, saw his total compensation rise to $20.8 million in 2010, according to a regulatory filing by JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ). 

 That is a sharp increase from the $1.3 million in total compensation he received in 2009. Dimon's salary remained at $1 million. In 2010, however, he received a $5 million bonus, nearly $8 million in stock awards and $6.2 million in option awards. By way of comparison, JPMorgan posted a $17.4 billion profit in 2010. Large pay packages for bankers who oversaw the transactions that caused a near collapse in the world economy became a flash point during the financial crisis. Some of that anger has eased, but banker pay remains a sensitive issue, especially at financial institutions that took taxpayer bailout money. JPMorgan has repaid the $25 billion of bailout funds it took from the U.S. Treasury and is widely considered to have weathered the crisis better than other major U.S. banks. Dimon's 2010 total compensation is below his 2008 total of $35.8 million. The details of were released in a regulatory filing on Thursday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. JPMorgan shares closed down 24 cents at $47.40 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday. (Reporting by  Clare Baldwin  and Jonathan Stempel; editing by  Andre Grenon )
