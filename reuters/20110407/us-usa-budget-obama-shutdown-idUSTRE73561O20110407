 FAIRLESS HILLS, Pennsylvania  (Reuters) - President Barack Obama warned on Wednesday that a shutdown of the federal government would harm the economy just as it was gaining momentum. 

 Obama, who spoke at a town-hall style event in Pennsylvania, urged Democrats and Republicans to compromise in the budget fight in order to get a deal and avert a shutdown. (Reporting by  Jeff Mason  and  Caren Bohan ; Editing by  Sandra Maler )
