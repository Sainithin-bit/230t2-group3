 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President Barack Obama and Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader, will speak on Thursday to determine whether there should be another budget meeting between Obama and congressional leaders, a congressional source said on Wednesday. 

 Reid, House of Representatives leader John Boehner, Obama and Vice President Joe Biden failed to reach an agreement on spending in White House talks on Wednesday to avert a government shutdown, but said their staffs would continue to negotiate throughout the night.
