 (Reuters) - Federal prosecutors are investigating whether two former Credit Suisse ( CSGN.VX ) brokers lied to investors about how they placed their money into short-term securities, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter. 

 The investigation involves the $330 billion market for auction rate securities, which allow issuers such as municipalities and student loan companies, closed-end mutual funds or financial institutions to borrow money for the long term but at short-term, or lower, interest rates, the paper said. The probe by the Justice Department's U.S. attorney's office for New York's Eastern District represents the first known criminal matter stemming from the crumbling auction-rate securities market, the paper said. Until now, the fallout in the auction-rate securities market has led only to civil litigation. Credit Suisse isn't a target of the Justice Department's investigation, people familiar with the matter told the paper. Two New York-based brokers, Eric Butler and Julian Tzolov, resigned from Credit Suisse on September 7, 2007, amid accusations by clients that they were misled about the nature of the auction-rate securities they bought, the paper said. A lawyer for Butler declined to comment, while Kenneth Breen, a lawyer for Tzolov, said his client should not be blamed for an unforeseeable market failure and investors understood the risks, the paper said. Clients said they were told the securities they purchased were backed by student loans. Some clients complained to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department, the paper said, citing a person familiar with the matter. Both the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority are also probing the matter, people familiar with the case told the paper. U.S. regulators have launched a sweeping investigation into the auction-rate securities market, sending subpoenas to several banks and brokerages, since tens of billions of investor dollars froze after the market largely collapsed in February. Many dealers had chose to stop supporting auctions with their own bids. Credit Suisse, Butler, Tzolov and the Justice Department could not be immediately reached for comment.
