 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Army said on Wednesday it might cancel a $6.2 billion Textron Inc armed helicopter program after finding that projected costs had soared more than 40 percent above initial estimates. 

 One possibility is that the Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter, or ARH, being built by Textron's Bell Helicopter unit, could be "terminated" after a mandatory review, but the Army has a critical need for its capabilities, said Paul Boyce, an Army spokesman. "We've been working closely with Bell-Textron on this," he told reporters in announcing the review triggered by cost growth of more than 25 percent compared with a base line. Boeing Co is a potential competitor if the contract is canceled or opened for rebidding. Official notification of the cost-growth cap breach went to the U.S. Congress Tuesday night, Army officials said. Bell Textron, responding to the army announcement, said it remained confident it could produce the ARH at "an affordable price." "Bell Helicopter and its team of suppliers are ready to begin low-rate initial production of the ARH, and we are dedicated to producing a world-class weapons system for the Army's warfighters," said Thomas Dolney, a company spokesman. The program is designed to supply 512 helicopters over the next 10 years to replace about 375 Bell OH-58D Kiowa Warrior helicopters, the army's most heavily used fleet in Iraq and Afghanistan. Going with a different contractor for the helicopters is "a potential outcome," an army official said at the briefing. Currently, there are no replacement helicopters for the Kiowa Warriors, 29 of which have been lost during combat, army officials said. The Army's initial replacement, a $14.6 billion Boeing/United Technologies RAH-66 Comanche program, was canceled in 2004 in favor of buying a larger number of less expensive platforms with reduced capabilities. An army acquisition official said the per-unit cost of the planned new ARH fleet had shot up to more than $12 million from $8.6 million when the base line estimates were made in 2005. The official declined to go into details about reasons for the cost growth. Under a law known as Nunn-McCurdy for its sponsors, a U.S. weapons program must meet four conditions to be allowed to continue after its projected costs rise more than 25 percent. The law requires the Defense Department to justify continuing the program based on its importance to U.S. national security; the lack of a viable alternative; new program cost estimates are reasonable; and evidence the problems that led to the cost growth are under control.
