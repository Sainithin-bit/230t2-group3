 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Defense Secretary Robert Gates plans an "expedited recompetition" for $35 billion worth of new aerial refueling tankers to be overseen by the Pentagon's chief weapons buyer, according to two congressional aides and a third source briefed on the plan. 

 Defense Undersecretary John Young would become the new "source selection authority" for the program, instead of the Air Force, said the source, who asked not to be named. The Air Force in February awarded the contract to Northrop Grumman Corp and EADS, prompting an immediate protest by losing bidder Boeing Co, and vows of congressional intervention by its supporters in Congress. Last month, the Government Accountability Office said it found "significant errors" in the Air Force selection process, and urged the service to redo the competition. Gates discussed his plans with selected lawmakers on Wednesday morning, including Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat. "I think his goal is to redo it this year," Levin told reporters on Wednesday. Gates will discuss the "way forward" on the contract at a 1 p.m. (1700 GMT) briefing, Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman told reporters. In addition to putting Young in charge, the Air Force will reconstitute the source selection advisory committee for the tanker competition, but under new leadership, and instruct them to focus on the eight protest counts that were sustained by the GAO, said the source briefed on the plan. Defense analyst Loren Thompson of the Lexington Institute said Gates was clearly elevating the issue to the top leadership level, with an eye to picking a new winner before the end of the Bush administration. But given congressional concerns, a possible World Trade Organization ruling in July on the U.S.-European dispute over aircraft subsidies, and the sheer complexity of the tanker competition, Thompson said it was very unlikely a decision could be reached in such short order. Jim McAleese, a Virginia-based defense consultant, praised Young's willingness to assume responsibility for the controversial program, and predicted he would do everything in his power to finish work on it before the end of the year. "That type of Pentagon leadership is critical to an expedited recompetition to protect program continuity before the change of administration," McAleese said. However, Young could face some questions because he had publicly endorsed the Air Force's handling of the tanker competition before the GAO decision was released. George Behan, spokesman for Washington Democratic Rep. Norm Dicks, a strong Boeing supporter, said lawmakers still had many questions about how the process would unfold. "The question is, are they willing to concede that we may get to a different outcome and then accept that outcome," he said. Sen. Maria Cantwell, another Washington state Democrat, told Reuters: "What we want to make sure is that the rebid is not just a redo with a rubber stamp 'approved' on it. We want to make sure that ... we don't have another misstep." The Air Force surprised the defense community when it chose Northrop and EADS, the European aerospace giant, to build 179 tanker aircraft used to refuel warplanes in mid-air. The 15-year contract is the first of three acquisition phases for what the Air Force calls its number-one purchase priority. The GAO, a nonpartisan congressional watchdog, said in upholding Boeing's protest last month that the company would have had a "substantial chance" of being selected if not for flaws in the evaluation process. Boeing shares were up 1 percent to $66.57 in early afternoon trading, while Northrop shares were off 0.3 percent at $65.99.
