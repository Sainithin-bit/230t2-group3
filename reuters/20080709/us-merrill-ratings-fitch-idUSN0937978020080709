 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Fitch Ratings said on Wednesday it may cut Merrill Lynch & Co Inc's MER.N debt rating due to expected ongoing write-downs and diminished prospects for earnings. 

 Fitch placed Merrill's long-term issuer default rating of "A-plus," the fifth-highest investment grade level, on review for downgrade, but affirmed the No. 3 Wall Street investment bank's short-term ratings. "The rating action results in part from diminished expectations that Merrill's fixed income, currency and commodities operation will attain a sustainable level of core profitability in the near term," Fitch said in a statement. Fitch said the rating action on Merrill follows its review of the investment banking industry. It also affirmed ratings for Lehman Brothers LEH.N, Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ), and Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ). The rating outlook on Lehman and Morgan Stanley is negative, while Goldman's is stable. The outlook indicates the likely direction of the rating in one to two years.
