 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Merrill Lynch & Co MER.N will determine how much of its stakes in BlackRock Inc ( BLK.N ) and Bloomberg LP to sell based on the size of its second-quarter loss, a person briefed on the matter said on Wednesday. 

 If analysts' current estimates of up to $6 billion of write-downs are accurate, Merrill could need to raise roughly $5 billion of capital, the person said. The company could reach that level by selling the 20 percent stake in Bloomberg, which Merrill Chief Executive John Thain said last month could be worth $5 billion to $6 billion. Or some portion of the 49.8 percent stake in BlackRock, the largest publicly traded U.S. asset management company, could be sold, the source said. The BlackRock stake is worth about $10 billion, based on current share prices. A sale of a portion of both stakes is also conceivable, he added. Determining exactly how much capital Merrill would try to raise is difficult, because companies often seek more funds than they need. A Merrill Lynch spokeswoman declined to comment, citing a quiet period. The company reports earnings next week. Merrill Lynch has recorded more than $30 billion of write-downs since the third quarter of last year. Analysts say the third-largest U.S. broker-dealer suffered in the second quarter as bond insurers lost their top ratings and the structured credit market weakened. Thain hinted last month that he would rather sell the Bloomberg stake than the interest in BlackRock, which he called a strategically important asset. "Bloomberg is just a very good investment," he said. Merrill Lynch sold its investment management business to BlackRock in 2006 in exchange for shares in the asset manager, whose funds it distributes. The company plans to keep its strategic relationship with BlackRock even if it sells part of its stake, a person close to Merrill said last week. Asset sales make more sense for Merrill Lynch because issuing equity would be too expensive, analysts said. When the company raised more than $12 billion in December and January, it agreed to compensate those investors for future share issuances at too low a price. If Merrill issued more than $1 billion of shares now, it would have to pay the December and January investors about $4 billion in cash or stock. Bloomberg competes with Thomson Reuters in the market for financial news and data. (Editing by  Derek Caney  and Lisa Von Ahn)
