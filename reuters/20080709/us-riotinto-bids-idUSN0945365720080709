 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bidders for Rio Tinto Plc's ( RIO.L )( RIO.AX ) U.S. coal unit, Energy America, have a deadline of the end of business on Wednesday to lodge interest in the asset, sources familiar with the situation told Reuters. 

 Initial indications of interest were due on Wednesday, sources said. A large number of bids were expected for the unit, which Rio Tinto put up for sale in November, one source said. The unit, estimated to be worth about $4 billion by one analyst, employs about 1,675 people and owns open cut coal mines in the Powder River Basin of Montana and Wyoming. A Rio Tinto spokeswoman declined comment on Energy America. The company said in June that the sale of the unit was on track to be completed in the third or fourth quarter of this year. The sale of Energy America is part of Rio Tinto's plan to sell $15 billion worth of assets following its takeover of aluminum producer Alcan. When Rio Tinto put Energy America up for sale in November, it said it would explore options to sell some or all of the unit. One of the sources said on Wednesday that the company's preference was to sell the unit as a whole. Parties interested could include large international companies, U.S. companies, or private equity, U.S. coal industry analyst Jeremy Sussman at Natixis Bleichroeder said earlier on Wednesday. But if existing Powder River Basin competitors bid, the assets may have to be split up, he said. "We don't think any one Powder River Basin player would be able to buy the entire set of assets because of U.S. antitrust regulation," Sussman said. Companies with Powder River Basin operations include Peabody Energy Corp ( BTU.N ), the world's largest coal producer, Arch Coal Inc ( ACI.N ), and Foundation Coal Holdings Inc FCL.N. Sussman said there could be interest from eastern U.S. producers that would want to diversify. Coal companies in the eastern United States are Patriot Coal PCX.N, with mines in West Virginia and western Kentucky; and Pittsburg-based Consol Energy Inc ( CNX.N ), which is the largest U.S. coal producer east of the Mississippi River according to its Web site. Canada's Teck Cominco ( TCKb.TO ), primarily a copper and zinc miner, owns a 52 percent direct and indirect interest in the Elk Valley Coal Partnership, which has metallurgical coal mines in British Columbia and Alberta. While Teck wouldn't comment directly on Rio Tinto, a Teck spokesman said, when asked earlier in the week, that thermal coal was "certainly a business that has appealed to us in concept." International companies with coal interests include Xstrata XTA.L, Anglo American Plc ( AAL.L ) and BHP Billiton Ltd/Plc ( BHP.AX ) ( BLT.L ), which has a metallurgical coal unit. Rio Tinto is itself the subject of an unsolicited all-share takeover bid from BHP Billiton worth about $170 billion. It rejected that offer in February. One Asian resources banker said he thought Energy America would be unlikely to go to an overseas buyer. "As much as Asian parties may take an interest out of curiosity, it is unlikely that they could realize the value that others could, so they're unlikely to bid," the banker said.
