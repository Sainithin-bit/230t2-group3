 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wachovia Corp WB.N, the fourth-largest U.S. bank, has narrowed its search for a new chief executive to a short list led by Treasury Undersecretary Robert Steel and GMAC LLC Chief Executive Alvaro de Molina, the Wall Street Journal said on Wednesday. 

 A final decision is expected within days, the newspaper said, citing people familiar with the matter. Wachovia spokswoman Christy Phillips-Brown, GMAC spokeswoman Toni Simonetti and a Treasury spokeswoman declined to comment. GMAC is the finance company and parent of mortgage lender Residential Capital LLC. Wachovia is seeking a successor for Ken Thompson, whom it ousted in June after a series of write-downs and legal mishaps, and the ill-timed $24.2 billion acquisition in 2006 of California mortgage lender Golden West Financial Corp. Lanty Smith, the interim chief executive, is leading the search to replace Thompson, and has said he wants the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank to remain independent. Smith is expected to remain chairman, the Journal said, citing the sources. Wachovia lost $708 million in the first quarter and may post a second-quarter loss as well. It also has stopped making new option adjustable-rate mortgages, a key reason it bought Golden West in the first place. Steel is a former executive at Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ), which has been advising Wachovia on how to handle its credit and debt problems. He was a key figure in helping arrange a plan last year among large banks to back so-called structured investment vehicles, ultimately deemed unnecessary. De Molina is a former chief financial officer and investment banking chief at Charlotte-based Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) and also is well regarded on Wall Street. Wachovia shares closed down $1.25, or 8 percent, at $14.29 on the New York Stock Exchange, as the banking sector suffered a broad decline. Shares of Wachovia have fallen 63 percent this year.
