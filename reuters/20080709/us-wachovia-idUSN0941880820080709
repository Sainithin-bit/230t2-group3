 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wachovia Corp WB.N and Piper Jaffray Cos ( PJC.N ) said on Monday they had received inquiries from U.S. and state regulators related to their auction rate securities, including the failure of auctions for such issues. 

 The inquiries are part of an industrywide investigation into the collapse of the auction rate securities market. Wachovia, the fourth-largest U.S. bank, was subpoenaed and said in the filing that it was cooperating with inquiries into underwriting and sales of the securities that had been launched by the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission and several state regulators. Piper Jaffray, an investment bank focused on mid-sized companies, also said in a filing that it was cooperating with the requests. The $330 billion market for auction rate securities froze this winter following auction failures caused by the credit crisis. Auction rate securities are long-term bonds that behave like short-term debt and have long been popular with conservative investors because of their tax-exempt status. They are often issued by municipalities and their interest rates are often reset frequently. Charlotte, North Carolina-based Wachovia also said it was named in a class action suit filed in March in U.S. District Court in Manhattan by holders of the securities. The suit claims the bank misrepresented the quality and risk of the auction rate securities, charges the bank said it would fight. Sources told Reuters last month that New York's attorney general and securities regulators in several U.S. states were probing auction-rate securities and the role Wall Street firms in enticing investors into the troubled market.
