 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Retail chain Steve & Barry's is expected to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy as early as this week, the Wall Street Journal reported on its website on Tuesday. 

 The report, which cited people familiar with the matter, said the Port Washington, New York-based retail chain had been unable to raise rescue financing. It had been in last-minute discussions with Sears Holdings Corp ( SHLD.O ) for a bail-out, the paper said. The paper reported last month that it needed some $30 million in rescue financing. The company could not be immediately reached for comment. (Reporting by  Dane Hamilton ; Editing by  Braden Reddall )
