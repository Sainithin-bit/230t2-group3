 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - Natural gas exploration and production company Chesapeake Energy Corp ( CHK.N ) said on Wednesday it expects a net loss for the second quarter due to its hedging strategy. 

 In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Chesapeake said: "We anticipate incurring additional substantial unrealized losses in the quarter ended June 30, 2008, and we expect such losses could result in our reporting negative revenues from natural gas and oil sales and will result in an overall net loss for such quarter." Excluding losses related to hedging and other items, analysts on average expect a profit of 85 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. The Oklahoma City company also said SEC staff members have made inquiries about certain disclosures and information in the its annual 10-K report and quarterly filing for the first quarter, according to a separate filing with regulators. "We believe that the disclosures and financial statements in these filings comply in all material respects with applicable SEC regulations and that our financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles," the company wrote. Chesapeake responded to the SEC inquiries in a letter on June 13, it said. Shares of Chesapeake slid 5 percent, or $3.13, to $58.42 in late-afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
