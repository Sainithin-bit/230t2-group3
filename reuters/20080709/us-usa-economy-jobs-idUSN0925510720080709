 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Employers hired workers in May at the slowest pace in nearly five years as a fragile economy apparently sapped enthusiasm for adding staff, a government report showed on Wednesday. 

 The total rate of hires, which gauges the number of employees added to payrolls during month, fell to 3.1 percent from 3.4 percent in April and was the slowest pace since a matching 3.1 percent in June 2003, the Labor Department said. In June 2003, the jobless rate hit 6.4 percent, the job market looked bleak and the downward trend in nonfarm payrolls did not bode well for consumer spending. Industries driving the hire rate down in May were construction, trade, transportation and utilities, the department said in its monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover survey. Over the 12 months through May the hires rate dropped in manufacturing, wholesale trade, retail trade, information and finance and insurance. The survey lags many job market gauges, but it can provide additional insight on labor market dynamics. Last week, the Department said U.S. employers cut workers in June for a sixth straight month, the longest streak since 2002. For the month, 62,000 nonfarm jobs were shed, bringing the number of jobs lost this year to 438,000. The unemployment rate was 5.5 percent. (Reporting by  Nancy Waitz ; Editing by Dan Grebler)
