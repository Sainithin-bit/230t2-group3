 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Private equity firm Blackstone ( BX.N ) plans to invest more than 1 billion euros ($1.57 billion) in a project to build wind farms in the North Sea to generate electricity, people familiar with the matter said. 

 Blackstone plans to take a stake in the "Meerwind" project to build some 80 wind farms off with a capacity of 400 megawatts off the German island of Helgoland, two people said on Wednesday. The owners of the project, privately-held German investment company Windland Energieerzeugungs GmbH, and Blackstone declined to comment.
