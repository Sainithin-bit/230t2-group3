 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Bank of Canada's outlook on the Canadian economy remains downbeat, Governor Mark Carney suggested on Saturday while giving no hint as to how big an interest rate cut markets should expect this month. 

 In a March 4 statement after slashing its benchmark interest rate by a half-percentage point, the central bank signaled "important downside risks" it said were "materializing, and in some respects, intensifying." When asked for an update on his expectations for Canada, Carney referred to joint statements by Group of Seven finance officials and IMF policy-makers over the weekend that spoke of weakening global economic prospects. "You can look at the topics of conversation this weekend at the G7 and the IMFC and we have focused on risks that would meet those descriptions, notably financial conditions and the outlook for the U.S. economy," he told Reuters. The G7 communique on Friday said "near-term global economic prospects have weakened." "On the upside, there has been some focus quite naturally on the outlook for commodity prices, notably food prices but also the general outlook for commodity prices and the durability of current levels," he said. A majority of market players expect the Bank of Canada to shave another 50 basis points off its overnight rate on April 22 from its current 3.5 percent, but signs of strong domestic demand make it an uncertain bet. Carney declined to provide more certainty. "I find that the most useful thing with markets is to try to glean information from markets and not to guide markets how to think, because if you guide them how to think you're just looking at yourself in the mirror," he said. The 42 year-old former Goldman Sachs banker has been painfully cautious in his public remarks since taking office in February, appearing more comfortable discussing the intricacies of financial markets than monetary policy. FREE RIDE ON INFLATION? On the inflation front, Canada has none of the pressures experienced in other countries because of its currency's strength against that of its top trading partner, the United States. In fact, consumer inflation has been below the bank's 2 percent target for months, giving it plenty of leeway to cut rates without fear of fueling price hikes. Carney has suggested that as the economy slows and commodity prices eventually drop along with demand, there will be even less pressure on inflation. The bank will release its revised projections on April 24. "From a terms of trade perspective, or a commodities perspective, that's one of the issues we'll be looking at quite closely and upon which we will comment when we release our broader projections," he said. On the other hand, he acknowledged the free ride of low inflation could end in 2009 but did not seem worried it could spiral out of control. Downward pressure on prices from the strong Canadian dollar, which cheapens imports, might be a one-off event that is not sustained, he said. The prospect of a U.S. recovery and its impact on Canada could also have inflationary effects. "We're mindful of the inflation risks on the upside and the downside." Unlike his predecessor David Dodge, Carney declined to comment on the value of the Canadian dollar, which has appreciated 40 percent since 2002. After spiking to a modern-day high against the U.S. dollar last November, the currency has eased to trade within a range close to parity. But he said the bank monitored the exchange rate closely. "We're not indifferent to the level of the exchange rate and we think through the implications of the causes of movements in the exchange rate and the implications for the real economy and inflation." Carney is eager to see the Bank of Canada obtain more powers to provide liquidity to markets, which he says would allow it to be more helpful in times of market distress such as the global credit crunch that began in August. Legislation now in Parliament, if passed, would let the bank provide more term funding and accept a wider range of collateral from market players tapping into its liquidity facilities. Existing legislation, which Carney says is outdated, works well for providing liquidity to overnight money markets and for enacting emergency powers under certain conditions. "There is also the requirement that we publish our policy under those powers. That's the next step, we would publish the policy and be quite transparent in what we intended to do," he said.
