 MONTREAL  (Reuters) - Hudson's Bay Co. said that its 
governor and chief executive Jerry Zucker died on Saturday of 
cancer. 

  Zucker's wife Anita Zucker will become governor of HBC, 
making her the first woman to hold that position in the 
retailing company's 338-year history.  Current HBC Deputy Governor and President Rob Johnston will 
become CEO, the company said in a statement issued late 
Saturday night.  A wealthy American businessman, Zucker was founder of the 
conglomerate The InterTech Group, one the largest privately 
held corporations in the United States.  He acquired HBC, the oldest commercial corporation in North 
America, in 2006.  (Reporting by Robert Melnbardis, editing by Jackie Frank)
