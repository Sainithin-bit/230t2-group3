 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Banks will have to accept that regulators demand higher capital provisioning for risk in response to the latest crisis in financial markets, the head of the Basel Committee of bank supervisors said on Sunday. 

 "They spoiled the party," Nout Wellink, head of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, told Reuters in an interview two days after governments of the G7 economic powers announced plans to try to make financial markets less accident-prone. Among the planned reforms is an increase in the amount of capital banks will need to hold to account for risks posed by some of the more exotic financial instruments that became all the rage during the credit boom which went belly-up in August as a crisis in the U.S. mortgage market snowballed. "We are still in the process of formulating more precisely our proposals," Wellink said. "The impact of these proposals -- I'm talking here about the off-balance sheet items, I'm talking about structured products and assets in the trading book -- will be an increase in capital requirements." He declined to set a time for when new capital rules would be put in place but said the authorities were well aware of the need to avoid compounding current strains on banks by raising capital requirements in the middle of a financial storm. "We are not fools. We do realize there are better moments to introduce substantial increases in capital requirements." Banks never like such moves and were seeking to convince governments, regulators and supervisors that the best way to respond to the crisis was to let them make improvements on a voluntary basis, Wellink said. "This is their approach. I think we (supervisors) will go further in certain respects whether they like it or not," he said, adding that regulators need to be more "aggressive" than in the past. "It's true they spoiled the party. And it's also true ... that the addition of capital charges they never like, but having said that, the incentives are not the right incentives, so it's clear we'll have to give them the right incentives," he said. The International Monetary Fund reckons the current crisis could lead to write-downs and credit-related losses nearing $1 trillion. Banks have already announced more than $200 billion in losses and write-downs in recent months. "It's self-evident that we will introduce the new regime in such a way that banks can absorb it," said Wellink. The difficulty of putting a value on toxic assets that no longer have a market is complicating efforts to bring the crisis to an end. "It's still a moving target," said Wellink. "It all depends on what happens in the U.S. housing market. As long as that market hasn't stabilized, it is extremely difficult to say where we will end up with respect to this side of the problem." He said supervisors, ratings agencies and the auditing industry were all working on improved model-based approaches to valuation where the market had failed, and were trying to ensure they had enough reliable data. Still, Wellink said there was no magic model that would be hatched in a few months time. "That's impossible." Another proposal among the many endorsed by G7 countries is one to oversee the world's biggest banks much more closely via a "college of supervisors" that would liaise with each other and more directly and regularly with the boards of top banks on key issues such as risk management. About 20 to 25 banks would be concerned by this, Wellink said. (Editing by  Tim Ahmann )
