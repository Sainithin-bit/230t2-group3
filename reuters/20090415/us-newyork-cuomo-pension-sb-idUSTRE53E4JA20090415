 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo said on Wednesday he expected more charges as a result of his ongoing investigation into the payment of fees to win business from the state pension fund. 

 "We do expect other charges as we have other cases being worked up as we speak," he told reporters in a conference call. Cuomo and the Securities and Exchange Commission are probing kickbacks paid by companies seeking to manage New York's pension fund. On Wednesday, new charges were announced against the former head of the New York Liberal Party, while a hedge fund manager pled guilty. (Reporting by  Joan Gralla ; Editing by  Chizu Nomiyama )
