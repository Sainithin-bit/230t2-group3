 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Three senior healthcare bankers have left Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) for a boutique investment bank, adding to a flood of departures since Bank of America acquired Merrill Lynch & Co in January. 

 Alan Hartman, previously head of mergers and acquisitions for the Americas at Merrill, and Merrill's former global co-heads of healthcare investment banking, Richard Girling and Mark Robinson, are joining Centerview Partners, that bank said in a statement on Wednesday. Centerview Partners was founded in 2006 and provides financial advisory services, including mergers and acquisitions, capital allocation and divestitures.
