 STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - Swedish fashion giant Hennes & Mauritz ( HMb.ST ) reported a bigger-than-expected fall in sales at established stores in March as shoppers cut spending in the toughest economic climate in decades. 

 H&M, the world's third-biggest clothing retailer by sales after Gap Inc ( GPS.N ) and Zara owner Inditex ( ITX.MC ), reported a 3 percent year-on-year drop in sales at established stores in March. Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast same-store sales would be down just 0.2 percent, although predictions ranged from a fall of 3 percent to a rise of 2 percent. "I believe that we have come out of a period of unprecedented growth, and these numbers are really just telling us that people are cutting back on things that are not basic needs," said Alessandra Coppola, analyst at SP Equity Research. Both H&M and Inditex, however, have stuck to forecasts for an increase in like-for-like sales this year as they expect to weather a staggering economic downturn better than other clothing retailers, thanks to their offering of high-fashion looks at low prices. H&M shares, which are up some 42 percent from November of last year, when the global economic crisis went into overdrive, touched their highest level in nearly a year on Tuesday. They eased 2 percent to 340 crowns by 0837 GMT (4:37 a.m. EDT) on Wednesday. STILL THE STAR? Analysts said cooler March weather and an Easter holiday, which landed in March a year ago, weighed on sales which have already been hit by lower consumer spending around the world. H&M's biggest market, Germany, is expected by the International Monetary Fund to contract around 5 percent this year. Analysts said the fashion giant could see a quick rebound in April. The firm occasionally gives limited guidance on the current month, although in this case H&M did not give a view about sales so far in April. "It's more about the weather -- a cool March this year, which held back the spring sales," said Stefan Stjernholm analyst at Handelsbanken Capital Markets. "We expect a rebound in April." H&M only gives round numbers for sales and does not give currency figures. Total sales for March were up 6 percent from a year ago versus a forecast of a 9.7 percent rise. Anders Wiklund, an analyst at Evli Bank, said it would take more than one disappointing month to alter H&M's long-term case. "I think people still see the H&M as the star in the gang," he said. "They have over a long period of time shown that their concept works. They are so financially strong and big that they can survive and do well." H&M posted a surprise 13 percent fall in first-quarter pretax profit last month due to unfavorable currency swings. But with a stronger Swedish crown, the exchange rate may work in H&M's favor in the second quarter as it could lower purchasing costs. New store openings could also help. "They opened a net 19 stores in March and that might help fuel sales growth in April," said Rolf Karp, an analyst at Ohman Fondkommission. H&M has stood by plans to open a net 225 stores this year in spite of a grim sales environment for retailers. (Editing by David Cowell and Simon Jessop)
