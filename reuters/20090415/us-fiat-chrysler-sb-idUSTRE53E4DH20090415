 ZURICH  (Reuters) - Italian auto group Fiat is still aiming for a deal with U.S. car maker Chrysler but will not ask for an extension on the deadline for the talks, Fiat Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne said on Wednesday. 

 "I still intend to reach a good conclusion," Marchionne said, speaking at a press conference. "There is not a single reason why Fiat cannot close by April 30." Fiat is still looking for strategic partnerships elsewhere, he added -- "in Europe, North America, everywhere." Marchionne reiterated that the first quarter of the year was "tough."
