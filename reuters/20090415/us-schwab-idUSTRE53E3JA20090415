 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Charles Schwab Corp SCHW.O said its first-quarter earnings fell 29 percent, but it beat expectations, helped by strong trading revenues, and a healthy inflow of new assets, sending its shares up as much as 9 percent. 

 The No. 1 U.S. discount brokerage said it attracted $25 billion in net new assets in the quarter, suggesting it continued to snap up investment advisers and clients amid the sharpest market contraction in decades. "The numbers are good. They had good customer inflow," said Anton Schutz, president of Mendon Capital. Earnings totaled $218 million, or 19 cents per share, down from $305 million, or 26 cents per share, a year earlier, hurt by lower asset valuations and interest rates as well as $59 million in severance charges related to job cuts and other measures. But excluding a gain related to the repurchase of certain outstanding company debt, losses on mortgage-backed securities and severance charges, Schwab earned 21 cents a share, beating analysts' average forecast of 16 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Net revenue fell 15 percent to $1.11 billion, but also beat analysts' expectation for $1.07 billion. Schwab's trading revenue jumped 5 percent, boosted by heavy volumes in a period that saw markets plunge to multiyear lows before rebounding somewhat in recent weeks. "We are not seeing any material changes in the trends that you would have seen from the published numbers," Chief Financial Officer Joe Martinetto said in an interview with Reuters, although he warned it was early to forecast a trend for April. Net interest revenue fell 27 percent, depressed by near-zero interest rates. A lengthy bear market threatens to scare individual investors away from the market, which would hurt Schwab and other online brokers. Schwab said total client assets totaled $1.10 trillion on March 31, down 21 percent from last year. The company, which also provides banking and financial advice, relies more than its rivals on asset management. The closely watched daily average revenue trades figure, or DARTS, jumped 14 percent from February to March, a record month for the company. COMPANY AFFIRMS FORECASTS Martinetto added that fee waivers on its money market funds, which have suffered from low yields due to declining interest rates, were in the "single digit millions" in the first quarter, adding up to a very small impact on the company's earnings. Schwab began waiving fees in January. The company warned fee waivers could total $200 million for the entire year, most of them taking place in the second half of 2009. In January, when Schwab announced up to 600 job cuts, the company said revenue could drop as much as 20 percent in 2009. The firm has also said DARTS could drop 7 percent in 2009 if interest rates remain close to zero and U.S. stock markets fail to recover. "We are in line with our expectations given where we are in market valuations and interest rates," Martinetto said. "There are definitely some headwinds that remain out there for us if equities valuations, and interest rates don't improve from here." Low interest rates hamper the ability of online brokers to earn interest from the assets they manage. Schwab is by far the biggest asset manager among online brokerages, which also provide banking and financial advice. The company's shares were up 4.3 percent to $17.07 in early afternoon trading on Nasdaq, after rising as much as 9.6 percent earlier in the session. The stock has risen 6 percent in 2009, lagging a 10 percent gain in the Amex Securities Broker Dealer Index .XBD.
