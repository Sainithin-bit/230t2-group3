 TORONTO  (Reuters) - The president of the Canadian Auto Workers union said on Wednesday that labor costs should not stand in the way of Chrysler forging an alliance with Italian automaker Fiat SpA. 

 "There's no question that we need the Fiat deal, there's no question that we need the partnership," CAW President Ken Lewenza told reporters. (Reporting by  John McCrank , writing by Frank Pingue; editing by Rob Wilson)
