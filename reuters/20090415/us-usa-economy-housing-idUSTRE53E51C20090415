 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilder sentiment rose in April to its highest level since last October, the National Association of Home Builders said on Wednesday. 

 The NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market index rose to 14 from 9 in March, emerging from single-digit territory for the first time in six months, the group said in a statement. April's increase was the largest one-month gain since May 2003. (Reporting by  Lucia Mutikani ; Editing by  Chizu Nomiyama )
