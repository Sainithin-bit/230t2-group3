 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. industrial production fell an unexpectedly sharp 1.5 percent in March, Federal Reserve data showed on Wednesday, capping a brutal quarter as businesses pared orders and cut inventory in a deepening recession. 

 For the first quarter as a whole, output dropped at an annual rate of 20 percent, the largest quarterly decrease of the current recession, which began in December 2007. That is likely to reinforce expectations that the overall economy contracted sharply in the first quarter. The drop in March marked the sixth consecutive monthly decline, and matched the revised 1.5 percent fall in February, originally reported as a 1.4 percent fall. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 1 percent drop for March. At 97.4 percent of its 2002 average, output in March fell to its lowest since December 1998. The capacity utilization rate dropped to 69.3 percent, the lowest since the data series began in 1967. (Reporting by  Emily Kaiser ; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
