 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - New York state Attorney General Andrew Cuomo said on Wednesday he has filed criminal charges against the former chair of New York's Liberal Party, Raymond Harding, in a pension kickback scheme. 

 Cuomo also said he has already extracted a guilty plea from a hedge fund manager involved in the scheme. Harding got over $800,000 in illegal fees on state pension fund investments, Cuomo said in a statement. Hedge fund manager Barrett Wissman pled guilty to "his role in the pay-to-play scheme," the Democratic attorney general added. (Reporting by  Joan Gralla  in New York; Editing by  Chizu Nomiyama )
