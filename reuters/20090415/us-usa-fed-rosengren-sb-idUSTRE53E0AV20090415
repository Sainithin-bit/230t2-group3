 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The current financial crisis highlights the need for a systemic risk regulator, a top Federal Reserve official said on Tuesday, but a regulator would face "profound challenges" and would need sufficient authority to change financial institutions' behavior. 

 Most of the world is experiencing "what has already been a long and severe recession," making issues of regulatory reform more pressing, Eric Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, said in remarks prepared for delivery at the Seoul International Financial Forum, "The need for such extensive government intervention on an essentially worldwide basis highlights the importance of a more stable financial infrastructure -- and I believe, to have organizations with explicit responsibility for financial stability," he said. Had a systemic risk regulator been able to monitor solvency risk, liquidity risk and risk management, and react to practices viewed as unsafe and unsound, "some of the most serious financial problems might have been identified and their severity lessened," Rosengren, who is not a voter on the Fed's policy-setting committee this year, said. A regulator would need to monitor any rapid appreciation of a particular asset class, or of financial institutions or markets, Rosengren said. Warning flags would include divergence of financial trends from past experience and would need to trigger questioning whether new trends seem likely to hold up over time, he said. However, a systemic regulator would face a number of challenges, not least being how much power it would have to step in when any potential problems are spotted, Rosengren said. "While the ability to identify emerging problems is critical, it is not enough," said Rosengren, who prior to becoming the Boston Fed's president headed the bank's Supervision and Regulation Department. "The systemic regulator would need to have the powers necessary to stop the unsafe practices." A systemic risk regulator would also need an in-depth understanding of how the financial industry and products really work, he said, something that wasn't the case in the run-up to the current crisis. The credit default swaps market ballooned, for example, "but still seems less well understood than is desirable," Rosengren said. A systemic risk regulator would also have to work in a global environment and be aware of potential spillover of problems to other countries' financial systems, he said. "This will be both extremely important, and potentially very challenging," he said. "It will be important that they have the ability to interact in a coordinated way with their regulatory counterparts around the world." (Reporting by  Kristina Cooke ; Editing by Leslie Adler)
