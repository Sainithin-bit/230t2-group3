 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Investing on Wall Street is always a gamble, but determining the direction on any one day for U.S. stocks has increasingly come down to the final roll of the dice. 

 Hair-trigger investors, economic uncertainty and exaggerated movements due to program trading have made for roller-coaster sessions in recent weeks. Investors have been latching onto late-day news, including some stories that are not much more than rumor. This has frequently turned the last hour into a frenzy, turning the rest of the day into an extended prelude to an uncertain ending. "The moves that you see are based on nerves much more than they're based on fact," said Kenneth Polcari, managing director of ICAP Equities in New York. Volume has increased during these eleventh hour moves. The last half hour accounted for about 30 percent of daily volume for Russell 2000 stocks in May, compared with percentages in the mid-20s through most of 2009 and 2010. "This is a great market for anyone that's short term trading, but for the person that's trying to invest for the long term, it's very frustrating," said Polcari. Wednesday's session this week was a clear illustration of this. A plunge in shares of BP Plc ( BP.L )( BP.N ) hit energy stocks, and hurt sentiment. The S&P 500 ultimately ended down 0.6 percent, after climbing as much as 1.5 percent early in trading. Intraday volatility during May was greater than it has been since the first quarter of 2009, when the rally got underway, according to data from Credit Suisse. AFTERSHOCKS While the whipsaw moves recall the height of the 2008 meltdown, they have not been as volatile. The average move in the last half hour of the day in May was less than 0.5 percent, compared to 1.6 percent in October and November 2008, said Credit Suisse. To investors, however, the recollection of those rocky days is painfully fresh. "Investors say, 'I'm not going to let it happen to me again, I'm going to be prepared for this', so there's more of a risk aversion," said Paul Hickey, co-founder of research firm Bespoke Investment Group LLC in Harrison, New York. Market-watchers say what starts out as a small shift is exacerbated by program trading. This involves sell or buy programs for institutions that are triggered automatically when stocks surpass a predetermined price or technical level. The momentum builds as wary investors are reluctant to take the opposite trade. Doug Kass, president of Seabreeze Partners Management, in Palm Beach, Florida, estimates price momentum strategies are accounting for three-quarters of trading volume. "The program kicks in on a slight break in price momentum and then they run rampant," said Kass. TRADERS' MARKET Late-day sell-offs are also being prompted by hesitancy to hold risky bets overnight at a time when negative news from overseas has taken investors by surprise. On May 26, speculation that China was reassessing its euro zone debt holdings in late May prompted the market to backtrack -- reversing gains had through most of the day -- though the talk later appeared to have little substance. Normally, holding stocks overnight has little risk, but ongoing developments from BP, sovereign debt issues and news from unforeseen corners -- such as Hungary -- have made such exposure a legitimate concern. "People aren't willing to hold in the face of bad news coming out overnight," said Hickey. To be sure, the trend has gone both ways, as stocks have sometimes ended higher on late-day reversals. The see-saw action has contributed to making retail investors wary, as U.S. equity mutual funds saw outflows of more than $25 billion for the five-week period ended June 2, according to the Investment Company Institute. The aversion to the market also stems from the poor results during May, but the vacillations make individual investors who fled the market in 2008 less likely to get back in. Kass said the volatility will continue until financial regulators address the issues posed by momentum trading. "It's frustrating to institutions and individual investors because you get a disconnect between the market's action, the fundamental backdrop and where individual companies should sell at," Kass said.
