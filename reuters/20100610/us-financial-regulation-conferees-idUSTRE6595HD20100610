 (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers will merge the Senate's financial regulation bill with a similar measure that passed the House of Representatives late last year. 

 The conference committee is comprised of 12 Senators, seven Democrats and five Republicans, and 31 House members, 20 Democrats and 11 Republicans. The bulk of the negotiations will take place between the White House and the two lawmakers who pushed regulation bills through their respective chambers -- House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank, who is heading the conference panel, and Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd. However, the broader conference committee still has the power to debate and vote on revisions to the final bill. Below are the names of the conferees. CONFERENCE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN ** Barney Frank As chairman, the House Democrat will play a central part in merging the two bills. He has said the Senate and House bills are more alike than different and is aiming to wrap up the committee's work by June 24. Frank, an openly gay legislator known for his pragmatic brand of liberalism, is a key ally of President Barack Obama and pushed a bill through the House in December that achieved much of the administration's original reform objectives. Frank has already taken issue with a tough measure from Senate Democrat Blanche Lincoln that would force banks to spin off their swaps desk. He said the measure goes too far, giving industry and banking regulators hope that the ban will not be included in the final bill. SENATE DEMOCRATS ** Christopher Dodd Dodd was responsible for shepherding a broad financial regulation bill through the Senate. He will work with Frank to merge their separate bills. The Connecticut lawmaker has shown a willingness to work with Republicans. During Senate negotiations, Dodd tried to strike a bipartisan deal with two Republicans on his panel. Although talks broke down three times, Dodd still compromised on key issues. He agreed to house a new consumer watchdog in the Federal Reserve and allowed the central bank to retain supervisory authority over banks of all sizes. Dodd first won election to the House in 1974. He moved to the Senate in 1980 and was reelected four times. He has decided not to seek reelection in November. ** Blanche Lincoln The Senate Agriculture Committee chairwoman was successful in getting the Senate to include her controversial measure for the $615 trillion over-the-counter derivatives market. Facing a tough reelection battle in Arkansas and under pressure to prove that she was no friend of Wall Street, Lincoln proposed requiring banks to choose between their lucrative derivatives trading desks and access to federal backstops. After defeating a primary challenge from the left, Lincoln is now likely to tack back toward the center as she faces a strong Republican challenger in the November election. ** Charles Schumer The New York Democrat crafted measures designed to improve how publicly traded companies are governed. Schumer has pushed for more shareholder rights, including giving them an easier way to nominate board directors and a say on executive pay. ** Jack Reed The Senate Banking securities subcommittee chairman was in charge of crafting derivatives rules but was unable to reach a compromise with Republicans. The Rhode Island lawmaker has said he prefers an alternate approach to curb risky trading over Lincoln's derivatives measures. Reed, considered a liberal, introduced legislation that would expose credit rating agencies to greater liability. ** Tim Johnson The South Dakota senator is a champion of community banks and credit card companies. He is next in line to take over the chairmanship of Senate Banking Committee when Dodd retires at the end of the year. Johnson suffered a brain hemorrhage three years ago that hampered his mobility and impeded his speech, but he has been on the mend and his speech has improved markedly in recent months. ** Tom Harkin A prairie populist, the Iowa Democrat was sponsor last year of a bill to ban over-the-counter derivatives. He says financial reform must maximize clearing of OTC derivatives and assure public reporting of trades. ** Patrick Leahy The owl-eyed Vermont Democrat expects to be active on an amendment to limit credit and debit card fees and criminal penalties for fraud. He supports Lincoln's proposal to spin off swaps desks from big banks.
