 MONTREAL  (Reuters) - Governments around the world must put in place a system to resolve or liquidate large troubled financial firms, Tiff Macklem, Canada's associate deputy finance minister, said on Thursday. 

 "We've got to improve our ability to resolve firms in crisis," Macklem, who is also chairman of the Financial Stability Board (FSB)'s Standing Committee for Standards Implementation, told a conference. (Reporting by  Jennifer Kwan ,  Rachelle Younglai  and  Jonathan Spicer )
