 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Former New York Federal Reserve president Gerald Corrigan said the U.S. Congress is on the right path to improve financial regulations, but warned that the so-called Volcker rule might have unintended consequences. 

 "They have the ball on the fairway but they're not yet on the green," said Corrigan, now a managing director at Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ), making an analogy to a partially completed hole in the game of golf. "We are making progress," he added later. Speaking at Boston College's Carroll School of Management, Corrigan urged lawmakers to focus on reducing the likelihood of the largest banks taking excessive risks because of expected government bailouts, the doctrine known as "too big to fail." Congress must create a process for closing and liquidating giant banks that fail in an orderly manner, he said. But such a task is not easy, Corrigan warned, citing his 25 years working as a bank regulator. "In the history of mankind, we have never successfully executed the orderly wind down of a large failing financial institution," he said. "It is so damn hard to do." Congress is likely to enact strict limits on banks' proprietary trading activities, as suggested by former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker, Corrigan said. But he worried that this solely U.S.-enacted reform would put U.S. banks at a disadvantage in the global marketplace. "It's going to happen but it's not going to happen outside of the U.S., certainly not in Europe," he said. "That's a problem." "There is not a human being alive for whom I have greater respect than Paul Volcker," Corrigan added. "We do have a difference of opinion on this particular matter." Although complicated security structures were partly to blame for the crisis, Corrigan did not foresee banning financial innovations. "You can't regulate away complexity. You can't regulate away technology," he said. "It's here to stay." The root cause of the credit crisis, as in most past banking system meltdowns, was lending institutions making bad decisions, Corrigan said. But in congressional efforts to reform regulation "you don't hear much about what can be done to strengthen credit origination," he said. Corrigan, who left the New York Fed and joined Goldman in 1994, generally praised government efforts to revive the economy and minimize fallout from the crisis. "On the whole, the last 18 months have worked out probably better than many of us thought in the darkest days of the crisis," Corrigan said, citing in particular the ability of troubled banks to raise so much capital from private investors. Despite recent debt problems in Europe and stock market corrections around the world, Corrigan said he is still relatively optimistic about global growth prospects. The former Fed official conceded that the odds of a double dip recession have risen a bit lately but it is still an unlikely outcome, he said. "The odds still favor a respectable pattern of GDP growth at least out into the first half of next year," he said. "The U.S. will continue to stumble along in the mid two's, maybe even three percent if you get a little lucky." (Reporting by  Aaron Pressman )
