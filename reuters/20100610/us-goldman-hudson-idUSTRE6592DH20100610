 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which charged Goldman Sachs Group Inc with fraud in April, is investigating another mortgage-linked deal once pitched by the Wall Street firm, the Financial Times reported, citing people close to the matter. 

 The SEC has been gathering information about Hudson Mezzanine Funding, a $2 billion collateralized debt obligation, but the probe was preliminary and there was no certainty it would lead to additional charges against Goldman, The Financial Times reported. Goldman declined to comment on the report. In April, U.S. securities regulators charged the powerful Wall Street bank with civil fraud in connection with the structuring and sale of another CDO called Abacus 2007. The Financial Times said the Hudson probe is part of a wider investigation into CDO securities dealing on Wall Street. On Wednesday, an Australian hedge fund sued Goldman over its investment in the Timberwolf CDO, claiming the subprime mortgage-linked security contributed to the fund's demise in 2007.
