 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The number of workers filing new applications for unemployment insurance fell less than expected last week, government data showed on Thursday, pointing to a gradual labor market recovery. 

 The U.S. trade deficit widened slightly in April, as weaker foreign demand hurt U.S. exports and oil prices jumped to their highest since October 2008, a U.S. government report showed on Thursday. KEY POINTS: JOBLESS CLAIMS: * Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dipped 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 456,000 in the week ended June 5, the Labor Department said. * Analysts polled by Reuters had expected claims to slip to 448,000 from the previously reported 453,000, which was revised to up to 459,000 in Thursday's report. * The four-week moving average of new claims, considered a better measure of underlying labor market trends, rose 2,500 to 463,000. * In the final week of May, the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid fell 255,000, the largest decline this year, to 4.46 million, the Labor Department said. * That was the lowest level since December 2008 and could be both a reflection of laid off workers getting jobs and exhausting their benefits. * Markets had expected so-called continuing claims to fall to 4.64 million. INTERNATIONAL TRADE: *:The trade gap was $40.3 billion in April, about unchanged from a revised estimate of $40.0 billion for March. * Wall Street analysts before the report had expected the trade gap to widen to around $41.0 billion, from the previously reported March figure of $40.4 billion. * Exports fell 0.7 percent in April to $148.8 billion after a big jump in March. * Imports, which also have risen over the past year as global trade recovered from the worst downturn in decades, dipped 0.4 percent in April to $189.1 billion. COMMENTS: SEAN SIMKO, FIXED-INCOME PORTFOLIO MANAGER, INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT COMPANY SEI, OAKS, PENNSYLVANIA: "Looking at the claims: the hope of a robust labor market recovery is fading. We may be in store for another jobless recovery because the market is just not healing as fast as expected. Companies are running very lean and are hesitant to add new positions. "On trade: the strong dollar is providing headwinds for our exports to grow. The report was pretty much in line with expectations and wasn't a shock to the market." JOHN CANALLY, ECONOMIST/INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, LPL FINANCIAL, BOSTON: JOBLESS CLAIMS: "We are still stalled here. Small businesses are still reluctant to hire. There may still be some distortions from the Memorial Day weekend. You need that the weekly number fall below 400,000 to convince the labor market is on an upward path. "The number of people that dropped off unemployment rolls is encouraging. It is a confirmation that the unemployment rate has peaked." INTERNATIONAL TRADE: "It came pretty much as expected. As it stands through April, this is a small drag on GDP. "But our April trade data are being overshadowed by the May Chinese trade data which are more current." FRED DICKSON, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, D.A. DAVIDSON & CO. LAKE OSWEGO, OREGON: "Basically as expected, we seem to have hit a plateau around the 450,000 to 460,000 range and that is pretty much in-line with what economists were expecting, I didn't see much of a market reaction to that. A little bit of an improvement in terms of continuing claims. I don't think the number would be a market moving number this morning. The pace of adding jobs is still somewhat slow and it is not expected -- it normally takes two years after the bottom of a recession to see real jobs growth." SUBODH KUMAR, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, SUBODH KUMAR & ASSOCIATES, TORONTO: "The sum total is that the claims number obviously isn't good, but it isn't as bad as people were fearing, given the idea of a double dip. I think equity markets have room, at least in the short term, to move up slightly on this. "The trade data here, and in China overnight, are both OK, but I think the markets right now think that some of these numbers show strength that isn't there. The period the data covered ended in May, before some of the issues in Europe took hold." DAVID SLOAN, ECONOMIST, 4CAST LTD, NEW YORK: "The initial jobless claims was a little disappointing but the continued claims was down sharply so it is a bit of a mixed bag. It doesn't change my outlook. The international trade numbers were slightly better than expected, but imports and exports were both down so it is not very encouraging for growth." TOMMY WILLIAMS, PRESIDENT, WILLIAMS FINANCIAL ADVISORS, SHREVEPORT, LOUISIANA: "The jobless claims data is in line with what Fed Chairman Bernanke said yesterday, that though the economic recovery seems sustainable it is going to be long slow process, and the jobs data is just one more indicator of that." SACHA TIHANYI, CURRENCY STRATEGIST, SCOTIA CAPITAL, TORONTO: "Not too exciting. On target for the jobless claims. The trade balance did show a better than expected print but in line with expectations. It's nothing all that remarkable. Trichet will be a key market mover for euro/dollar." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stock index futures hold gains after jobless claims, international trade data. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices fall DOLLAR: U.S. dollar little changed.
