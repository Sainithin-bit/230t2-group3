 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A BP ( BP.L ) official told U.S. lawmakers on Thursday he had not heard of any internal company discussions that BP may have to file for bankruptcy because of the growing costs related to the Gulf oil spill. 

 "I've heard no such suggestion, indication or concern raised internally within our organization," Raymond Dempsey, vice president of strategy for BP America Inc., told members of a Senate Homeland Security subcommittee at a hearing on the oil spill. Dempsey also said he had not heard any specific concerns raised about how the oil spill's costs could affect the company's stock price. (Reporting by  Tom Doggett ; Editing by  Alden Bentley )
