 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Representative Spencer Bachus said in a statement on Wednesday that he and five other Republicans have been named as members of a House-Senate conference committee to draft landmark Wall Street reforms. 

 Bachus said his colleagues from the House of Representatives on the panel will include Judy Biggert, Shelley Moore Capito, Scott Garrett, Jeb Hensarling and Edward Royce. All are Republican members of the House Financial Services Committee. Other members of the House delegation to the panel were expected to be named later on Wednesday. The Senate's delegation has already been named. The panel must merge competing House and Senate Wall Street reform bills. A single bill must win approval in each chamber before going to President Barack Obama to be signed into law. (Reporting by  Kevin Drawbaugh ; Editing by Leslie Adler)
