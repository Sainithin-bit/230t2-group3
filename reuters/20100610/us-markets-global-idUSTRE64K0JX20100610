 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - World stocks rallied more than more than 2 percent on Thursday and the euro rose for a third straight day after China reported strong export growth and solid demand for Spanish government bonds eased European debt concerns. 

 China said its exports jumped 50 percent in May from a year ago, reassuring investors about the path of the global economic recovery despite the euro-zone debt crisis. Europe is China's biggest overseas market. Commodities prices surged, with crude oil and copper rising as the Chinese export data instilled confidence in demand. China is the world's top base metals consumer and the world's second-biggest oil consumer. "If China does not slow down then the world doesn't slow down," said Keith Springer, president of Capital Financial Advisory Services in Sacramento, California. "Everything hinges on China. If consumer spending can get to the levels where it was, then we are in a new bull market." The major U.S. stock indexes rose nearly 3 percent on Thursday, a day after a late-day sell-off that had reversed strong gains in what has been a volatile month on Wall Street amid questions over whether expectations of an economic recovery have been overly optimistic. The strength in the euro helped pull European stocks from an early slump and spilled over to the United States. Movements in U.S. stocks have been closely tied to swings in the euro as investors use the currency as a barometer for confidence in the euro-zone economy. MSCI's all-country world index .MIWD00000PUS and the Thomson Reuters Equity Global Index  .TRXFLDGLPU  both rose about 2.3 percent. In the U.S., the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  jumped 273.28 points, or 2.76 percent, to 10,172.53. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  rose 31.15 points, or 2.95 percent, to 1,086.84 and the Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  climbed 59.86 points, or 2.77 percent, to 2,218.71. Energy shares gave one of the biggest boosts to the market, with the S&P energy sector .GSPE up 4.9 percent, making it the top percentage gainer among S&P sectors. Chevron Corp ( CVX.N ) provided the Dow with one of its major boosts, rising 3.4 percent to $74.17. The PHLX Oil Service Sector index .OSX rose 6.2 percent, with Baker Hughes Inc ( BHI.N ) soaring 10.6 percent to $42.42 and Halliburton Co ( HAL.N ) gaining 7.4 percent to $24.22. U.S.-traded shares of oil company BP Plc ( BP.N ) rebounded 12.3 percent, a day after plunging nearly 16 percent on mounting fears about how the company will cope with the massive costs of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. In Europe, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  closed up 1.57 percent at 1,014.14 points. Mining shares rose as the Australian government was said to be diluting its tax hike plans, and banks gained on the robust demand in Spain's government debt auction. "There's maybe a recycling out of the safe havens, with the dollar and gold down, and a delve back into risk," said Joshua Raymond, strategist at City Index in London. "There are expectations for markets to move gently higher." The Australian government is due to soon announce major changes to its controversial mining tax, a newspaper said on Thursday, boosting shares of mining stocks in London. BP's London shares ( BP.L ) declined 6.65 percent to 366 pence, hitting their lowest level since 1997 as they caught up to the losses in the United States that occurred after UK markets closed on Wednesday.

FIRMING EURO The euro, drubbed in recent days on concern that investors may balk at funding debt-laden European nations, rose after signs of strong demand at the Spanish bond auction. The currency hit its high for the day as the European Central Bank said its government bond purchase program should not be viewed as a change to monetary policy. The euro rose 1.18 percent to $1.2126 from a previous session close of $1.1985. It had sunk below $1.19 on Monday, to its lowest level since early 2006. The dollar declined against a basket of major trading-partner currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index .DXY falling 1.01 percent to 87.01. The dollar-yen exchange rate was unchanged at 91.26 yen. Europe's common currency got an earlier boost after Dai Xianglong, chairman of $114 billion China's National Social Security Fund, said the euro would gradually stabilize and that the U.S. fiscal deficit remained a big concern, tempering safe-haven demand for the dollar. There have been some concerns in currency markets that the debt crisis would persuade central banks, including China's, to cut back on their euro reserves. U.S. Treasury debt fell as signs of improvement in weekly U.S. jobless insurance claims added fuel to a sell-off ahead of a 30-year bond auction. Benchmark 10-year note yields rose 0.15 percentage point to 3.33 percent. Other U.S. data showed its trade deficit widened slightly in April, a sign of consumer demand and modest recovery. In energy and commodities, U.S. light sweet crude oil rose $1.10, or 1.48 percent, to settle at $75.48 per barrel, and spot gold fell $13.75, or 1.12 percent, to $1216.60 an ounce. Copper for three-months delivery on the London Metal Exchange rose to $6,380 a tonne, versus $6,340 a tonne on Wednesday and after hitting a session high of $6,455.
