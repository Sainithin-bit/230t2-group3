 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Top White House economic adviser Lawrence Summers said on Friday the United States must spend now to revive the economy but reduce future debt while acting to ensure benefits of future expansion are more broadly shared. 

 Summers, speaking to a Brookings Institution forum in Washington, said it while was appropriate to borrow at an "abnormally high scale" during times of economic crisis in the long term "debts can't be rising relative to your income." Summers also said the U.S. expansion should be based more on exports and investment and less on foreign borrowing, and that any future growth should be more equitably shared. "If you want to propel this economy forward and we want to have a sound expansion it has to be an expansion whose benefits are more broadly shared," he said.
