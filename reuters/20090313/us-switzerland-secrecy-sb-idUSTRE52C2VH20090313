 BERNE  (Reuters) - Switzerland agreed on Friday to relax its strict bank secrecy rules and cooperate more on tax evasion in a last-ditch attempt to fend off a global crackdown on tax havens that is rattling the offshore banking industry. 

 The upcoming meeting of the Group of 20 (G20) developed and emerging nations in which they are due to discuss tax havens prompted Switzerland, Austria and Luxembourg on Friday to follow recent moves by other offshore centers and offer more tax transparency. In a landmark statement, the Swiss government said it would embrace standards for tax cooperation and exchange of information set by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), meaning more information on suspected tax evaders will be shared with other countries. "Banking secrecy does not protect tax crimes. International cooperation on taxes has become more important given the globalization of financial markets and in particular against the background of the financial crisis," Swiss President and Finance Minister Hans-Rudolf Merz told a news conference. Switzerland will not drop bank secrecy altogether and will only pass on information following detailed requests on individual cases from other countries. "There will be no automatic exchange of information," Merz said. The government said it was seeking a fair transition for its bank clients to the new regime and was seeking a possible tax amnesty for existing clients. "It is important to have some transitory measures, to know how bank clients will be treated in the future. This is a very important aspect that will need to be defined," Merz said, adding that such measures could mean a tax amnesty. Switzerland is the world's biggest offshore financial center, with an estimated $2 trillion in global wealth held abroad. The country has been under pressure to relax its strict bank secrecy rules from a U.S. tax fraud investigation targeting its No.1 bank UBS. The Swiss government said in a separate statement issued on Friday that it would instruct a U.S. law firm to defend the country's position in a civil case against UBS that seeks to force the bank to reveal the details of 52,000 bank clients. A decision on Thursday by tiny offshore rivals Liechtenstein and Andorra to adopt more tax cooperation has put even more pressure on Berne. It comes on the heels of moves by other centers, including Singapore, Hong Kong, Jersey and the Isle of Man, to open up. (Editing by Karen Foster)
