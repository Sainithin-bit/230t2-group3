 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett said he was approached twice to help American International Group Inc in the final days before the U.S. government rescued the insurer last September, Bloomberg said. 

 Buffett fielded a phone call on a Friday night in September from AIG's chief executive at the time, Robert Willumstad, and opted not to bid on part of the insurer's U.S. property-casualty operation, the Berkshire Hathaway Inc chairman told Bloomberg Television in an interview. Two days later a second offer to participate in a transaction fell apart when a cash injection by a private group didn't materialize, he said. "It wasn't very tough," to resist an investment, Buffett said. "They needed more than we could supply by far. I didn't know the extent of it, but I knew that." He said the second offer involved "an insurance transaction that might have occurred in conjunction with a big injection of funds by some group -- I don't even know who was necessarily in it -- on Sunday night," Buffett said. "That never went anyplace." AIG was first bailed out by the Federal Reserve with an $85 billion credit line shortly after investment bank Lehman Brothers was allowed to fail and brokerage Merrill Lynch sold itself to Bank of America Corp.
