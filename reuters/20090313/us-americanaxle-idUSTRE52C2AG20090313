 DETROIT  (Reuters) - American Axle & Manufacturing Holdings Inc's ( AXL.N ) auditors have warned that the auto parts supplier may go out of business because of pressure on its main customer, General Motors Corp ( GM.N ), the company said on Friday. 

 American Axle generated about three-quarters of its $2.1 billion of sales last year from GM. It joined GM in receiving a "going concern" notice from auditors with U.S. auto industry sales plunging to the lowest monthly levels in 27 years. "As a result of the current automotive industry environment and the uncertainty relating to the ability of GM and Chrysler to continue operating as going concerns ... it is uncertain whether we will be in compliance with the financial covenants ... throughout 2009," American Axle said in an SEC filing. "Should (the company) fail to be in compliance with these covenants and we are unable to obtain a waiver or amend these covenants, we may be unable to continue as a going concern." American Axle posted a staggering $112.1 million fourth-quarter net loss, blaming the weakness of the major automakers. It suspended its quarterly cash dividend and said it would continue to trim hourly and salaried labor costs. The parts maker was formed by an investor group in 1994 out of GM plants and supplies components mainly for pickup trucks and SUVs. A three-month strike at American Axle last year by the United Auto Workers led to broad GM plant shutdowns. The notice highlights the increasing financial pressure across the U.S. supplier sector as extensive production cuts by automaker customers that began in the fourth quarter of last year cut deeply into revenue. QUESTIONS ON LEAR, VISTEON Another large supplier to GM, Lear Corp ( LEA.N ), has said it expects to receive a going concern notice from its auditors. Lear supplies seating and electronics to the auto industry. Visteon Corp VSTN.PK, spun off by Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) in 2000, also warned in February that it was uncertain whether it would stay in compliance with debt covenants. Chrysler, about 80 percent owned by Cerberus Capital Management CBS.UL, GM and Ford all have slashed North American production over the past five months to try to get inventory in line with demand. GM and Chrysler have received $17.4 billion of emergency government loans and have asked for nearly $22 billion more. The government has until March 31 to determine whether Chrysler and GM can become viable and should receive more loans. Two industry groups that represent U.S. auto parts makers submitted requests in February for emergency government loans to support the supply base and stop the crisis from deepening. The groups proposed that the government guarantee U.S. automakers' payments to parts suppliers, accelerate payment terms or guarantee commercial loans to companies that make auto parts. They did not name companies that might need loans. The pressure on the sector is palpable. Grant Thornton, a corporate advisory and restructuring services firm with expertise in the sector, has estimated up to 40 percent of the U.S. auto parts suppliers are at financial risk due to the sharp production cuts in North America. A $30 stock in mid-2007, American Axle's share price has fallen as low as 26 cents, which it reached on Monday. The NYSE warned American Axle last week that its stock might be delisted, a factor the company also cited as putting pressure on its ability to stay afloat.
