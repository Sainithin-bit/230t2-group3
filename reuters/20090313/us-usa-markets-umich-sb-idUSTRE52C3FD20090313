 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. consumers' mood improved unexpectedly in March as confidence in government economic policy improved, but sentiment remained anemic overall and close to a record low, a survey showed on Friday. 

 KEY POINTS: * The Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers said its preliminary index reading of confidence for March increased to 56.6 from 56.3 in February. That beat economists' expectations for a reading of 55.0. * The Surveys of Consumers said those who thought the administration of President Barack Obama was doing a good job rose to 23 percent. In February that number was 14 percent and it is up from just 7 percent in January. COMMENTS: TOM SOWANICK, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, CLEARBROOK FINANCIAL, PRINCETON, NEW JERSEY: "Current conditions component shows a bit less caution 65.5 versus preliminary number of 62.3. This data also confirms that retails sales for the past two months have not been a fluke. This recession may be over sooner than most are now expecting." JOSEPH TREVISANI, CHIEF MARKET ANALYST, FX SOLUTIONS, SADDLE RIVER, NEW JERSEY: "People are looking for anything that will give an indication of stabilization. This will be another small, incremental indication that perhaps we're getting near some sort of bottom. It says nothing about the degree of recovery or the timing of recovery. But it is sensible that you'll get a stabilization, given the fear we saw last year. You have to remember these are still very low levels for stabilization, and stabilization should not be mistaken for recovery. I still think with continuing job losses and low level of consumer spending that it'll be difficult for the economy to generate a recovery yet." PIERRE ELLIS, SENIOR ECONOMIST, DECISION ECONOMICS, NEW YORK: "The consumer sentiment reading was mildly better than expected, which tends to confirm the hints of consumer stabilization that we've seen recently. Psychology is not falling apart anymore." GREG SALVAGGIO, VICE PRESIDENT OF TRADING, TEMPUS CONSULTING,  WASHINGTON: "It's a sign of times to come. We might have found a bottom. The positive results we are starting to see from the U.S. banking sector, in addition to yesterday's encouraging retail sales number are demonstrating a bottom might have formed for the economy. In the short term, slightly dollar negative as we see the dollar lost its safe haven allure as more risk is introduced into portfolios but longer term it's ultimately dollar positive." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. equity index futures add to gains. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices hold losses. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar holds losses.
