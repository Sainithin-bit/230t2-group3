 MUMBAI  (Reuters) - About eight potential bidders have registered with Satyam Computer Services SATY.BO to buy a 51 percent stake in the fraud-hit Indian outsourcer, two investment banking sources said on Friday. 

 "There has been at least 5-8 bids. We expect a much much smaller number to proceed to the next stage of putting in a financial bid," one banker with knowledge of the deal said. He declined to be named as he is not authorized to speak to the media. Satyam was plunged into a crisis in January after its founder quit as chairman revealing profits were falsified for years. The company is now overseen by a government appointed board, which has begun the process of inducting a strategic investor. The last day for registering expression of interest was Thursday, and the bidders will need to show the ability to invest 15 billion rupees ($290 million) by March 20. Engineering and construction firm Larsen & Toubro ( LART.BO ), which owns a 12 percent stake in Satyam SAY.N, diversified Spice Group, IT services firm Tech Mahindra ( TEML.BO ) and Nasdaq-listed iGate ( IGTE.O ) have all expressed interest. The bankers declined to reveal the names of the other bidders. Final bids are expected to come in at between 40-50 rupees a share but the price could change depending on the disclosures, they said. By 0850 GMT, shares in Satyam were down 4 percent at 45.30 rupees valuing the firm at about $600 million. ($1=51.6 rupees) (Reporting by  Narayanan Somasundaram ; Editing by Ranjit Gangadharan)
