 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Prosecutors will bring additional charges as warranted against Bernard Madoff or anyone else involved in the fraud that bilked investors of billions, the Acting U.S. Attorney for Manhattan said on Thursday. 

 "Today is one step in an ongoing investigation," Lev Dassin said in a statement after Madoff pleaded guilty in Manhattan federal court in the biggest Ponzi scheme in Wall Street history. "While we do not agree with all the assertions made by Mr Madoff today, his admissions certainly establish his guilt. "We are continuing to investigate the fraud and will bring additional charges against anyone, including Mr. Madoff, as warranted," Dassin said. Madoff pleaded guilty to 11 charges. Prosecutors have estimated that the scheme drew in as much as $65 billion over at least 20 years. Madoff is the only person who has been charged in the case. (Reporting by  Grant McCool )
