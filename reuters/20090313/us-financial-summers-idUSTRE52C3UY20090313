 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Top White House economic adviser Lawrence Summers on Friday called for the United States to lead a global effort to boost regulatory standards and warned against allowing regulators to compete with one other. 

 Giving a nod to European governments that want to push reform to the top of the world economic agenda, Summers said no major financial institution or market should be allowed to escape regulatory scrutiny. But as finance ministers from the Group of 20 top wealthy and developing economies met near London on Friday, Summers also said most countries have the capacity to increase their fiscal stimulus efforts. "Globally, the United States must lead a leveling-up of regulatory standards, not as has happened all too often in the recent past, trying to win a race to the bottom," Summers told a Brookings Institution forum in Washington. Competition among regulators in different markets and in different financial capitals to lure business helped contribute to the financial crisis by allowing some firms to choose more lenient jurisdictions, while some products, such as credit default swaps, fell through gaps in the system and escaped oversight altogether. U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has said he will lay out by March 26 the Obama administration's regulatory reform approach, which will be taken up at a G20 leaders summit on April 2 in London. Summers said regulatory agencies should never be allowed to compete "for the privilege of regulating particular financial institutions," a practice that led to weak regulation and allowed some institutions to exploit gaps in U.S. oversight. He said there was a clear need for "much stronger" regulation of derivatives. Financial reforms should include requirements on levels of capital and liquidity that help to protect the overall financial system, even in very difficult times, he said. "And there must be far more vigorous and serious efforts to discourage improper risk-taking through transparency and accountability for errors," Summers said. MORE SPENDING CAPACITY The United States ahead of the G20 meetings has been pushing for increased government spending to lift global demand and beat back recession. But France and other euro zone countries have resisted, saying their efforts to date are sufficient and the focus should be on developing new rules to prevent future crises. "For a very substantial majority of the world economy, there is room for temporary fiscal expansion," Summers said, acknowledging that this would not be advisable for some nations, such as those in Eastern Europe. He said President Barack Obama's priorities at the G20 summit included spurring global demand and ensuring that emerging nations have access to adequate funding through multilateral institutions. Summers vowed that the United States will take steps necessary to get out of the current crisis despite the high level of debt it is taking on. "This was not a set of economic processes that would simply automatically fix themselves. If you didn't act and if deflation sets in, if the GDP collapses further...the magnitude of the federal borrowing, as large as it is today, will be far, far larger," Summers said. DEBT HANGOVER? Analysts have said the United States will issue more than $2 trillion in new debt in the current fiscal year to finance stimulus, financial rescue programs and cover revenue shortfalls brought about by recession. Summers did not address concerns expressed by Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao that massive U.S. deficit spending and near zero interest rates could erode the value of China's holdings of nearly $700 billion in U.S. Treasury debt. But the Obama administration sought to reassure China. "There is no safer investment in the world than in the United States," said White House spokesman Robert Gibbs. A U.S. Treasury Department spokeswoman said the United States had the capacity to spend without risking its creditworthiness, as the Treasury market remained the "deepest and most liquid market in the world." Summers said the debt incurred would contribute to the process of economic recovery and would finance alternative energy technologies, better education and new infrastructure that would lay a foundation for more sustainable growth. "What we would all like is to see an American economic expansion that was less based on foreign borrowing, less based on wealth created on unsustainable asset price inflation and was more based on exports, was more based on investment -- both public and private -- than the pattern that characterized the previous expansion," he said (Additional reporting by  Ross Colvin  in Washington and  Glenn Somerville  in Horsham, England; Editing by Kenneth Barry and Leslie Adler)
