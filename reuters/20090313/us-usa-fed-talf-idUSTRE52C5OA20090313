 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve has been making concessions to powerful investors as it tries to ensure a successful launch next week of its long-awaited and ambitious program to resuscitate consumer and small-business lending. 

 The U.S. central bank, rolling out its latest weapon to fight a deepening recession, will provide investors with loans to buy new debt backed by auto, credit card, student and small business loans in a bid to make credit more available. The Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan facility, known by its acronym "TALF", will launch next week with an initial target of providing $200 billion for financing new loans but the program could be expanded to as much as $1 trillion. To try to ensure the program will not fail, the Fed has sweetened some of the terms, and sources familiar with the situation say the Fed has urged Wall Street to be vocal about its concerns. Concessions include dropping curbs on pay for bankers and fund managers taking part in TALF and limiting the Fed's ability to comb investors' books to check they qualify. On Friday, the Fed said it would give firms two more days to complete the documentation to take part. The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA), the industry's main lobbying body, said, given the revised terms, it now expects good demand for the TALF when first bids are received between March 17 and March 19. On March 25, the Fed will settle the first loans. "I have clients trying to use TALF as a part of their portfolio strategy," said Jeffrey Gundlach, chief investment officer at Trust Company of the West with $110 billion in assets under management. Nevertheless, the worsening economy has led to more muted hopes for TALF than when it was announced in November. Some economists say Americans, hemmed in by worries about their jobs and their decimated stock holdings, are unlikely to be lining up to buy a new car or take out a student loan, no matter how easily available the financing. "TALF isn't the grand miracle cure," said fund manager Martin Sass who said his funds are finding attractive values in the asset-backed securities (ABS) sector regardless of TALF. However, combined with existing and likely further government programs, TALF should clear the way for the largest U.S. banks to lend again, helping them remain mostly in private hands and putting the economy on a path to recovery, he said. Sass, whose firm MD Sass has $6 billion under management, said there remained a need for a "more encompassing plan" to help remove bad assets from bank balance sheets. NO CAVALRY "Some of the luster has definitely come off since the first announcement and off the early hopes that this would be the cavalry that comes to save the economy," said Michael Feroli, economist at JPMorgan. For example, the difference in yield on three-year "AAA" credit card ABS over U.S. government debt narrowed sharply after the initial TALF announcement. But spreads have since given back some of those early gains as the depth of America's economic problems were further exposed. "The number one problem for new car sales right now is a demand problem, not a credit problem," said Jeremy Anwyl, CEO of Edmunds.com, a car sales website. He said most auto dealers he speaks to do not have TALF on their radar screens. David Brown, a partner at law firm Alston & Bird, said his clients are impatient for an expansion of the TALF to include lower-rated securities and existing loans. Douglas Landy, partner at law firm Allen & Overy, said a major concern is that the first $200 billion is "a drop in the bucket" compared with the scale of frozen lending. Last week, New York Fed president William Dudley said the TALF could be expanded to "other distressed asset classes, it could move down the credit spectrum to lower-rated tranches, and it could be used to fund older vintage assets." But he cautioned that the next version is still "in its early days". Mike Kagawa, portfolio manager at Payden & Rygel, said demand for student and credit card loans could be muted given cheap alternatives under other official rescue programs. He said automakers are likely to benefit most from TALF. World Omni Financial's $500 million auto ABS deal is expected to be the first deal using TALF loans according to market sources. "I'm not sure if at the end of the day it (TALF) really does anything except enrich those who are able to take part in this, like the hedge funds, banks and those entities that are able to leverage themselves up," said Kagawa, noting an irony in the use of debt to tackle the U.S. credit crisis, originally caused by over-borrowing. "So you're going to releverage those that we were trying to deleverage and we're all going to releverage them with government help."
