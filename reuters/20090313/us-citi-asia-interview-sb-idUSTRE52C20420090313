 SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - Citigroup said on Friday it plans to start equity brokerage businesses in Malaysia, Vietnam and Indonesia this year, and is seeking more branches in Thailand in a bid to expand its business in Southeast Asia. 

 The moves are a sign that the U.S. bank, which has been hit by massive losses in the United States due to the collapse of the housing market, is betting on Asia to boost its international business. "Our current focus is to invest all across the region," Piyush Gupta, who heads the Southeast Asia and the Pacific region for Citigroup, told Reuters in an interview. "We have been through two major downturns in this region, one in 1997 and then during the SARS (outbreak in 2003). We didn't choose to scale back during these periods." Gupta said lending to Southeast Asia, Australia and New Zealand saw marginal growth in 2008 and might remain flat this year as trade financing suffers from a downturn in exports and consumer demand slows.
