 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. stock market's ferocious decline in the first two months of the year may represent a capitulation trade and is now undervalued by as much as 10 percent, says veteran asset manager Martin Sass. 

 "From a valuation standpoint the market is undervalued. Not dramatically. It is about 10 percent undervalued," said Sass, chairman and chief executive officer of MD Sass, an investment management firm with $6 billion in assets under management. The S&P 500 stock index fell 27.62 percent from its 2009 peak on January 6 to close at a 12-year low of 676.53 on March 9. It has since rallied back by a third. Based upon current interest rates and projected earnings, Sass's firm estimates fair value for the S&P 500 at 818. The benchmark index closed on Thursday at 750.74  .SPX . Investors have been hoping the U.S. government's trillions in spending programs, aimed at underpinning both banks and consumers to shorten a deepening recession, would create some clarity for rebuilding investment portfolios. The unknown value of bad credits on bank balance sheets is still a looming unknown of mega proportions. However, Sass believes the "vast bulk of the damage" is over. "What we are seeing now is a rally from this point of maximum pessimism, which is usually when markets do stage big rallies. Whether this is the final one or we go back and forth, I'm inclined to say we'll see this back and forth," he said. The firm cut its S&P 500 forward earnings projection for 2009 to $40 but projects a rebound to $60 in 2010 "assuming even a modest recovery and then growing 7 percent or so a year thereafter." WHAT TO LOOK FOR Sass called the current broad-based rally "impressive" but said "our best estimate is this economic upturn is going to start in 2010." "I think the (Obama) administration is still behind the curve," he said, but added he believes the government stimulus plans will work to stabilize the financial system and reverse the downward economic spiral. What will signal the government is now ahead of the curve? "The single best indicator is going to be credit spreads," Sass said, noting they remain at historical highs. When short-term liquidity spreads, which remain very wide and illustrate investor unease, begin to narrow, Sass says that will show government programs are working and confidence is returning to the market. But one such measure of credit-market fear, the TED spread or difference between interest rates on three-month LIBOR and the three-month U.S. Treasury bill, has started to widen again, reaching a two-month high of 112 on Thursday. "In many cases you are seeing credit spreads that really are suggesting default rates that are higher than those that occurred during the Great Depression of the 1930s" he said. ATTRACTIVE VALUATIONS But even when facing Armageddon, Sass is not shying away from distressed credit investments. He is invested in top-tier bank loans and asset backed securities that are bringing yields of 15 to 20 percent. "We are getting yields I've never seen before. I've had the fund for 19 years and I've never seen spreads as wide as they are today," he said, highlighting they are senior most in the credit structure. He is avoiding U.S. Treasuries, fearful all of the stimulus money flooding the system will create inflation and force yields higher after a flight to safety drove them lower during the throes of the credit crisis. "Then they will become certificates of confiscation rather than certificates of safety," he said. In equities, the firm this week bought Internet advertising juggernaut Google ( GOOG.O ) and has positions in medical equipment maker Medtronic ( MDT.N ), biotechnology firm Genzyme GENZ.O and mobile phone maker Qualcomm ( QCOM.O ). "If I didn't own them today I'd buy them. I'm looking from the standpoint of a long-term investor," he said. In addition, he's bullish on insurer MetLife ( MET.N ), saying the book value for the company, which has $3 billion in cash and $38 billion in its investment portfolio, is $25. It closed on Thursday at $17.30. "The guys that are not going to need TALF money is MetLife," he said. The Term Asset-Backed Loan Facility, or TALF, is a joint U.S. Federal Reserve-U.S. Treasury loan program aimed at generating lending to consumers and small businesses. Sass is avoiding financial firms in general but is bullish on oil exploration and production companies, believing crude prices may drop into the $30 range before rising as demand improves with a global economic recovery. "I think oil will normalize around $75, let's say within three years," he said. Among his top energy picks are offshore driller Transocean ( RIG.N ) and oil services provider Baker Hughes ( BHI.N ).
