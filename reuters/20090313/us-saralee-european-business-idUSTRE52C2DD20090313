 (Reuters) - Sara Lee Corp SLE.N, which seeks to focus on its core food and beverage business, is examining a sale of its European household and personal-care business, the Wall Street Journal said, citing people familiar with the matter. 

 The company has hired Goldman Sachs to sound out possible bidders for the business, which could fetch more than $2 billion, the people told the paper. It was unclear if any deal will occur, the paper said. Sara Lee spokesman Mike Cummins declined to comment on the story, citing company policy not to comment on "rumor or speculation." Selling the household business, which accounts for about 15 percent of the company's sales, would be aimed at capturing value Sara Lee feels investors are ignoring, according to the paper. Activist hedge fund ValueAct Capital Management LP, which owns a 5 percent Sara Lee stake and has pushed other companies to divest noncore operations, gained a seat on Sara Lee's board in August, which could provide further impetus to a sale, the paper said. Possible bidders for part or all of the household business include Unilever ( ULVR.L ), Reckitt Benckiser Group ( RB.L ), S.C. Johnson & Son Inc and Colgate-Palmolive Co ( CL.N ), whose former president, William Shanahan, has been acting as an adviser to ValueAct, the paper said. Reckitt declined to comment, though acquisitions it has made recently have been very focused and in the healthcare sector. Unilever also declined to comment, while S.C. Johnson and Colgate-Palmolive could not be reached for comment by Reuters. Last month, Sara Lee reported a loss of $17 million, or 2 cents a share, in the second quarter ended December 27, compared with a year-earlier profit of $182 million, or 25 cents a share. International household and personal care profit fell 29.6 percent to $45 million in the second quarter, compared with a year earlier, with the company selling fewer products in that segment and also getting hit by the stronger dollar, which reduces the dollar value of sales made in other currencies. Sara Lee's shares were up 30 cents, or 4 percent, at $7.57 on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange .
