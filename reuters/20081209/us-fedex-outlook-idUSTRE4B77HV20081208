 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - FedEx Corp ( FDX.N ) said on Monday it expects to report a better-than-expected second-quarter profit, but slashed its fiscal 2009 outlook as a weakening U.S. economy offsets lower fuel prices, sending its shares down more than 11 percent in after-market trading. 

 The package delivery company's earnings warning came minutes after trucking and logistics company Con-way Inc ( CNW.N ) cut its full-year 2008 earnings outlook. Memphis-based FedEx estimated earnings of $1.58 per share for its fiscal 2009 second quarter ending November 30. Analysts had expected earnings of $1.51, according to Reuters Estimates. The company is due to report the results on December 18. But Fedex also sharply lowered its previously announced fiscal 2009 earnings forecast, to a range of $3.50 to $4.75 per share, from $4.75 to $5.25, as "significantly weaker macroeconomic conditions are expected to offset the benefits from lower fuel prices and the announced departure of DHL from the U.S. domestic package market." Deutsche Post AG ( DPWGn.DE ) unit DHL said last month it would halt its U.S. domestic service as of January 30, with the loss of 9,500 jobs, citing a slowing U.S. economy and an uphill struggle against local behemoths FedEx and United Parcel Service Inc ( UPS.N ). Both UPS and FedEx are considered bellwethers of U.S. economic activity. FedEx said it has lowered its target for capital expenditures for fiscal 2009 to $2.5 billion from a previously stated figure of $3.0 billion. Separately, trucking firm Con-way said it was cutting its full-year earnings outlook to a range of $2.20 to $2.35 a share, from a previously announced target of $2.60 to $2.80. The previous target already had been reduced in October from a range of $3.00 to $3.40. "With three weeks remaining to the end of the year, the company is maintaining a relatively wide range in guidance, due to turbulent market conditions and lack of reliable visibility into an economy which continues to deteriorate," San Mateo, California-based Con-way said in a statement. Con-way is regarded by analysts as one of the better performing less-than-truckload operators, which consolidate smaller loads into a single truck. In extended trading, FedEx's stock fell $8.43, or more than 11 percent, to $66.00 after closing up 72 cents at $74.43 on the New York Stock Exchange. In after-hours trading, UPS shares were down nearly 5 percent, or $2.65, at $55.97, while Con-way stock slid less than 1 percent to $25.60. (Reporting by  Nick Carey ; editing by  Richard Chang )
