 * U.S. may take equity stake in automakers 

 * U.S. Treasury bills auctioned at zero percent * Wall Street closes lower after two-day rally * Canada declares recession, cuts benchmark rate * Japanese recession deepens; $216 bln stimulus weighed By  Daniel Trotta NEW YORK (Reuters) - Washington stepped closer to bailing out U.S. automakers on Tuesday in a bid to stabilize the economy as neighboring Canada declared itself in recession and Japan said GDP shrank more than previously believed. The White House and Congress were negotiating terms for emergency loans that could give taxpayers an equity stake in companies that once symbolized the triumph of the free market. Now the government is considering taking warrants on shares of the automakers equal to at least 20 percent of the value of any federal loans they receive. Senate Republicans criticized the rescue plan as deeply flawed. As government extended its reach into the private sector, bearish news piled up around the world with the economy still beset by a credit crunch and economic slowdown. Investors had so little risk tolerance the U.S. Treasury auctioned $30 billion worth of four-week paper at zero percent interest, underscoring concerns about deflation and a fragile banking system. "It is a sure sign that fear has not left the marketplace," said Bret Barker, portfolio manager at Metropolitan West Asset Management in Los Angeles. "People are willing to forgo a return to preserve their capital." The Dow closed down 2.7 percent and the S&P 500 2.3 percent after a nearly 7 percent rally over the previous two days. European shares ended down 1.4 percent after Japan's leading index crept up 0.8 percent. While some institutional investors debated whether equities could be near their cyclical bottom, one fund manager said U.S. stocks in the spring could retest the 11-year lows that were hit in November as euphoria over a new U.S. president and a likely stimulus package wear off. "The reality of it is, come springtime this economy is not going to perk up the way we thought it was," Tom Atteberry, a partner at First Pacific Advisors, told the Reuters Investment Outlook Summit 2009. Added John Taylor, chairman and chief executive officer of FX Concepts Inc: "I am a bear. I'm not a bull." But influential Wall Street investor Jim O'Shaughnessy told the summit stocks were at their most compelling prices since 1982 because investors were pricing in a depression while the economy was only in a recession. BRAZIL VS. THE WORLD There was one notable exception on the macroeconomic front: Brazil, where the economy grew at an annualized 6.8 percent in the third quarter and 1.8 percent versus the second quarter.     Meanwhile, Canada's central bank cut its benchmark interest rate more aggressively than most economists expected, bringing it to its lowest level in 50 years and declaring for the first time that the Canadian economy was in recession. Japan's economy sank deeper into recession in the third quarter than initially estimated, shrinking 0.5 percent and reinforcing fears that the world's second-largest economy was facing its longest contraction ever.    The Yomiuri newspaper said Japan was considering spending $216 billion on new stimulus measures, or 3.6 percent of gross domestic product, to boost its economy. British industrial output fell at its sharpest pace in nearly six years in October, and revisions to previous months' data suggested the economy contracted more in the third quarter than initially thought. "Industrial production data, particularly manufacturing output, is a horror story. We've seen a number of sharp declines in recent months and if anything the pace of contraction appears to be worsening," said Philip Shaw, an economist at Investec. France reported a record trade deficit that reflected a Europe-wide slowdown. In Germany, the continent's engine, a survey of sentiment suggested the economy might start to emerge from recession in mid-2009 at the earliest. Japanese electronics maker Sony Corp said it will cut 16,000 jobs, curb investment and pull out of businesses to save $1.1 billion a year. "The number sounds big, but this staff reduction won't be enough," said Katsuhiko Mori, fund manager at Daiwa SB.
