 GENEVA  (Reuters) - Global airlines are heading for less drastic losses in 2009 than initially feared thanks to sharp falls in fuel prices but the industry remains in a "sick" state, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) said on Tuesday. 

 Overall revenues are expected to fall for the first time since 2002, with air cargo transport -- viewed as a barometer of the global economy -- declining more sharply than passenger traffic, the industry body said. IATA scaled back its estimate for total losses in the sector next year to $2.5 billion from the $4.1 billion it had forecast in September, based on a reduced average oil price of $60 per barrel. It also trimmed expectations on 2008 losses to $5.0 billion from $5.2 billion. But its 230 members, which represent 93 percent of scheduled international air traffic, still face a bumpy ride. "The outlook is bleak. The chronic industry crisis will continue into 2009. We face the worst revenue environment in 50 years," said IATA Director General Giovanni Bisignani. The "ferocity of the economic crisis" has overshadowed gains made from restructuring and greater fuel efficiency in recent years, he said. "The industry remains sick." Passenger traffic is forecast to fall 3 percent next year, the first drop since 2001, while cargo is predicted to be 5 percent lower in 2009 after contracting an estimated 1.5 percent this year, according to the Geneva-based body. Revenue is seen 6 percent lower at $501 billion, against an estimated $536 billion this year. Air cargo traffic, which makes up 35 percent of goods traded internationally, is continuing its decline, Bisignani said. Its 7.9 percent decline in October, the fifth consecutive month of increasingly severe drops, was a clear indication that "the worst is yet to come" for airlines and the slowing global economy, IATA said. European member airlines are expected to post losses of $1 billion next year, ten times higher than in 2008, it said. North America is expected to be the only region making a profit in 2009, but only some $300 million, less than 1 percent of members' revenue, it said. "An early 10 percent domestic capacity reduction in response to the fuel crisis has given the (North American) region's carriers a head start in combating the recession-led fall in demand," IATA said in a statement. Asia-Pacific carriers will see losses more than double to $1.1 billion in 2009 from an estimated $500 million in 2008. Airlines in the region, which accounts for 45 percent of the global cargo market, will be disproportionately hit by the decline in trade, it said. Oil prices have tumbled from a peak above $147 a barrel in July to around $44 as the economic downturn has slashed demand. The oil price fall is not fully reflected in the IATA figures because of hedging, according to IATA Chief Economist Brian Pearce. Some of the benefits of lower spot prices for fuel were being delayed into 2010, as hedging means many airlines are locked into higher than spot prices, Pearce told reporters. IATA's forecasts for 2009 were all based on an average price of $60 a barrel for oil for a total bill of $142 billion, some $32 billion lower than this year. Asked about the impact on Boeing and Airbus sales, Pearce said: "I would think that some of these orders and deliveries are likely to be at least deferred and some canceled." Bisignani also forecast 300,000 to 400,000 job losses over the coming year in the aviation and travel industry, which IATA says employs some 32 million people worldwide.
