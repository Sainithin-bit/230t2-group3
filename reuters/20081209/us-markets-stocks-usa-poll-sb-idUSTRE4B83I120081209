 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. share prices, on track for their worst year in more than 70 years, are expected to rise by about 10 percent next year if President-elect Barack Obama's huge proposed spending plan helps avert a much deeper economic slump, a Reuters poll showed. 

 The benchmark S&P 500 is seen ending 2009 at 1,000 or up 9.9 percent from its December 8 close of 909.70, according to the median forecast given in a poll of 23 analysts and strategists. They forecast a gain of 7.2 percent for the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI But even with a gain, Wall Street will still end 2009 in a bear market. The S&P 500 is down 38 percent so far this year. From its October 2007 record, it has fallen about 42 percent, but from the recent bear market low of November 20 it has gained approximately 21 percent, thanks in part to huge planned government spending for early next year. Obama, who will be sworn in on January 20, outlined his economic recovery plan last weekend, saying he aims to create at least 2.5 million new jobs by 2011 and launch the largest U.S. infrastructure investment since the 1950s. "You've got Obama constantly coming out day after day, saying he's going to be ready on day one," said Marc Pado, U.S. market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. in San Francisco. "That's a positive." The magnitude of the challenges confronting his incoming administration were laid bare by a report on Friday that showed the U.S. economy shed more than half a million jobs in November, the worst monthly jobs slump since 1974. But before the stock market firmly sets itself on a course to recovery investors may have to brace themselves for news on the economy getting worse, possibly sending indexes to fresh bear market lows. Of particular concern is the fate of U.S. auto makers. A failure of any of the big three -- General Motors ( GM.N ), Ford ( F.N ) and Chrysler -- could send shockwaves throughout the economy and fuel more investor panic, analysts said. "There's a chance that worse than expected news hits the headlines. It could be the effectiveness of the bailout, a major player going out of business, worse-than-expected job losses," said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank in Chicago. "That will help slow everything." In September analysts in a similar Reuters poll had U.S. stocks on track for their first annual loss in six years, with the S&P 500 seen ending 2008 down almost 11 percent, and the Dow almost 13 percent weaker. Year-to-date, the Dow is off 32.7 percent.
