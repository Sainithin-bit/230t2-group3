 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard Corp ( HPQ.N ) is seeing some "fuzziness" around its revenue forecast, but the company continues to believe it can deliver on its profit targets by effectively managing costs, HP's finance chief said on Tuesday. 

 Cathie Lesjak said HP's recurring revenue base generates more than half the company's profit, allowing it some cushion in a difficult economic environment. "We have every bit of fuzziness around our forecast for revenue as everybody else does," but the company remains focused on things it can control, such as cost structure, Lesjak told an audience at the Barclays Capital Global Technology Conference in San Francisco. HP is tightening its belt, but maintained the company's "muscle" is not being cut. The company will not go after "stupid deals" and will not compete in segments that threaten its focus on profitable growth, Lesjak said. For fiscal 2009, HP is forecasting earnings of $3.88 to $4.03 per share, excluding items, on revenue of $127.5 billion to $130 billion. Lesjak said demand continues to be strong in emerging markets, with some pockets of strength in Europe. The United States, she said, is not seeing any growth. Last week, HP announced that Ron Rittenmeyer, chief executive of EDS, which the company acquired for $13.9 billion earlier this year, would retire at the end of 2008. EDS, formerly a stand-alone unit, will be moved within the technology solutions group. Lesjak said HP is "very pleased" with the EDS acquisition, and said Rittenmeyer's decision was to be expected after integration milestones were quickly achieved. Pulling EDS within the TSG would allow more synergies, she said. HP's results in its most recent quarter got a big boost from EDS, which helped services revenue jump 99 percent. Excluding EDS, HP's overall revenue grew just 5 percent. Lesjak said the company would "absolutely" do another acquisition, but that it is looking at smaller deals. HP is the world's No. 1 maker of personal computers. Lesjak said the company is fully equipped to compete against low-cost rivals in the new netbook PC category, which is seeing strong growth. But she maintained that the company will not go after some low-end markets, unlike competitors such as Acer Inc ( 2353.TW ) and Asustek. Palo Alto, California-based HP's shares were up 15 cents, or 0.4 percent, at $35.38 in early afternoon trading. (Reporting by  Gabriel Madway ; Editing by  Andre Grenon )
