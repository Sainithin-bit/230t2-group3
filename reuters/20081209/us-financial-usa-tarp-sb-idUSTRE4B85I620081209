 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department official who administers the government's $700 billion financial rescue fund will testify before a House of Representatives panel on Wednesday, the panel said on Tuesday. 

 The official, Neel Kashkari, will be appear before the House Financial Services Committee at 10 a.m. EST to testify on the department's implementation of the Trouble Asset Relief Program, the panel said. In addition to Kashkari, the panel said it would hear from Gene Dodaro, the acting head of the Government Accountability Office, which last week issued a report criticizing Treasury's handling of bank bailouts. In the report, GAO said Treasury has yet to address a number of critical issues, including how it will ensure that the program is achieving its intended goals. The GAO is an independent auditing arm of Congress. (Reporting by Nancy Waitz, Editing by Walker Simon,
