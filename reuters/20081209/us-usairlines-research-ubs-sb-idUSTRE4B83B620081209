 (Reuters) - UBS expects the U.S. airline sector to have a bad first quarter due to losses on fuel hedges and weak demand, but said future quarters should be much better as the hedges roll off. 

 The brokerage raised its price targets on several airline stocks to reflect a better 2009 earnings outlook. Analyst Kevin Crissey said travel demand in November was worse than expected, but fuel prices are lower than he had modeled. "The sector has moved nicely higher over the last few weeks, but many stocks still look cheap to us," said Crissey, adding that his top pick is Delta Air Lines Inc. The brokerage, which recently completed its semi-annual corporate travel manager survey, said almost 75 percent of the managers believe their firms will cut air travel spend next year. Travel managers identified the U.S. domestic market as the region with the largest spending cuts planned in 2009, Crissey said. Travel to Europe is expected to be cut sharply, he added.
