 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Stocks fell on Tuesday as profit warnings from FedEx Corp ( FDX.N ) and others prompted investors to retrench after two days of big gains, while unprecedented demand for the safety of government securities signaled fear remains a dominant force in the market. 

 Transportation stocks led the pullback, with express shipper FedEx tumbling 14.5 percent after saying its 2009 profit would fall shy of estimates due to the global slowdown. The Dow Jones transportation average .DJT fell more than 5 percent. Shares of FedEx closed down 14.5 percent at $63.65. Markets were also rattled by an extraordinary sale of U.S. Treasury bills, widely viewed as the world's safest securities. Investors were so fearful of everything from deflation to the precarious condition of the banking system that they sacrificed all expected return just to hand over cash to the U.S. Treasury for safekeeping, producing an unprecedented zero percent rate. "There's still a ton of fear. People are now paying the government to take their money. Something is wrong," said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  fell 242.85 points, or 2.72 percent, to 8,691.33. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  gave up 21.03 points, or 2.31 percent, at 888.67. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was down 24.40 points, or 1.55 percent, at 1,547.34. Trading was choppy after shares jumped Monday to a month high, and analysts said profit-taking contributed to the negative tone. The Nasdaq gained more than 1 percent at one point before succumbing as losses mounted. With the day's slide, the S&P 500 was again negative on the month, after a brief pop into positive territory on Monday. The fall in Treasury bill rates, which effectively means investors are willing to pay the U.S. government a fee to look after their money, comes as stocks attempt to form a sustainable rally off recent lows. The broad S&P 500 is up nearly 20 percent from the November 21 lows but remains down close to 40 percent for the year so far. "Every day when the market closes we hear earnings estimates lowered, projections lowered," said Peter Kenny, managing director at Knight Equity Markets in Jersey City, New Jersey. "We hear the scenario of an economic slowdown which touches every asset class and every single equity sector." Texas Instruments TXN.N jumped 4.9 percent to $15.55 despite cutting its fourth-quarter revenue forecast. Procter & Gamble Co ( PG.N ) was the Dow's biggest weight, falling 4.3 percent to $59.79 after UBS cut its price target. 3M Co ( MMM.N ) fell for a second consecutive session as Citigroup and Credit Suisse cut their targets on the stock a day after the manufacturer cut its 2008 outlook and announced 1,800 job cuts. The stock was down 2.1 percent to $56.15. U.S.-traded shares of Sony Corp gained 2.3 percent to $20.50 <6758.T ( SNE.N ) after news it will cut 16,000 jobs, the biggest cuts by an Asian company during the financial crisis. Trading was moderate on the New York Stock Exchange, with about 1.44 billion shares changing hands, below last year's estimated daily average of roughly 1.9 billion, while on Nasdaq, about 2.27 billion shares traded, above last year's daily average of 2.17 billion. Declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 2,133 to 989 while decliners beat advancers on the Nasdaq by about 1,849 to 918.
