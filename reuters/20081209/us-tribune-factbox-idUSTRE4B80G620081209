 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Tribune Company, one of the largest U.S. newspaper publishers and media companies, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in a Delaware court on Monday due to a heavy debt load only a year after real estate mogul Sam Zell took the company private. 

 Below are some of the companies included in the Tribune Company bankruptcy filing: Chicago Tribune Newspapers Inc.- The newspaper published its first edition in 1847 and receives a daily readership of 1.7 million, according to the newspaper's website. Los Angeles Times Newspapers Inc. - First published in 1881 under the name of the Los Angeles Daily Times, the Los Angeles Times is the largest metropolitan newspaper in the country, according to the newspaper's website. KTLA Inc.- Tribune Company acquired the Los Angeles TV station for $510 million in 1985, fueling the media company's growth in the United States' second most populous city, according to the Tribune Company website. KWGN Inc. - The Chicago, Illinois-based television station was one of the first stations in the country to run a full schedule of shows in color, according to KWGN's website. The Hartford Courant Company - The Hartford, Connecticut-based paper is the country's oldest living newspaper and was founded in 1764 -- before the United States was even a country, according to the paper's website. Hoy LLC - Hoy is the second largest Spanish language daily newspaper in the United States. Chicago Cubs - The Cubs baseball team and their home park of Wrigley Field were not included in the bankruptcy filing, but analysts say Tribune will need court approval to sell any of its assets.
