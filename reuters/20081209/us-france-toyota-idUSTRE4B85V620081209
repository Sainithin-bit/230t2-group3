 PARIS  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ), the world's biggest automaker, is seeing a marked slowdown in the production and sale of vehicles in Europe and expects customers to buy fewer cars in France this year than in 2007. 

 Speaking on the sidelines of a forum, Tadashi Arashima, president of Toyota Motor Europe, said the global financial crisis was taking its toll on demand and that the outlook for 2009 was too volatile to make any forecasts. "We saw the deterioration for the past two or three months, that is September, October and November, in European markets," Arashima told Reuters. "We see a softening in the market for smaller cars as well." Toyota's only production site in France, located in Valenciennes, was on track to produce 240,000 vehicles this year, which Arashima said would all be sold. Annual capacity at the site in 2008 was 270,000 vehicles. That was the number of vehicles produced by Toyota in France last year and eventually sold. Joining other carmakers battling falling sales, Toyota said last month it would shut its French production site for four days in December and one week in March due to slowing demand for its Yaris model. Asked if Toyota would need further shutdowns, Arashima said: "The economy and the market are so volatile at the moment, so we are very carefully assessing how the market will develop." Toyota was carrying out a review of its global projects to see which would remain viable given market turmoil. "We are reviewing one by one what are the resources required to complete these projects versus what is the outcome we can get so we are carefully reviewing this not only for Europe but for everywhere," he said. Asked if any potential reduction in Toyota's capital spending for the fiscal year starting in April would have an impact on European operations, he said "probably not" as major projects such as a factory in St Petersburg had been completed. Toyota has set up an emergency committee, chaired by President Katsuaki Watanabe, aimed at boosting profitability over the next few months to avoid lowering its earnings forecasts again. It recently slashed its annual operating profit forecast by 1 trillion yen ($10.8 billion) to 600 billion. Turning to the outlook for consolidation in the auto sector given depressed valuations, Arashima ruled out possible interest by Toyota. "From Toyota's point of view I don't think we will be a part of these acquisitions. I don't think so," he said. (Reporting by  Tamora Vidaillet  and Helen Massy-Beresford; Editing by Andrew Macdonald)
