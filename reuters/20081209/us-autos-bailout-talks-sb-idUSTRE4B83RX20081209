 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Negotiations between the White House and Congress on a rescue package for ailing automakers have not "buttoned down" final legislative language but progress has been made, a senior administration official said on Tuesday. 

 "It's not buttoned down yet, we're still working through a number of issues. Discussions will continue this morning," the official told Reuters on condition of anonymity. "We made progress and hope to continue making progress. We want to move quickly, but it's most important that we get the policy right." (Reporting by  Tabassum Zakaria ; Editing by  Kristin Roberts )
