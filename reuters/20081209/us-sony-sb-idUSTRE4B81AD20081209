 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japanese electronics maker Sony Corp said it will cut thousands of jobs, scale back investments and pull out of unprofitable businesses as part of restructuring efforts to shave 100 billion yen ($1.1 billion) in costs. 

 KEY POINTS: -- Sony to slash investments in electronics operations by about 30 percent from mid-term plan, cut production facilities by about 10 percent from current 57 sites -- Sony to announce earnings impact from restructuring in January 2009 -- Sony shares have fallen nearly 70 percent since the start of the year For a graphic on Sony's share price click on: here COMMENTARY: KIM IK-SANG, ANALYST, HI INVESTMENT & SECURITIES, SEOUL "The global downturn is weighing on everybody, but Japanese companies suffer more from the yen's strength. Sony will also have to cut product prices to stay competitive. "Samsung (Electronics Co Ltd) and LG (Electronics) are avoiding job cuts and for now just have some employees on longer year-end holidays. It would cost them more if they cut jobs and try to hire back later. "Korean companies can wait and see for the time being before they consider more measures. They will suffer less even when Sony starts to cut prices further, as the weaker won gives them more room to cope with that." TOSHIYUKI MATSUSHITA, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, BLUEBEAR INVESTMENT MANAGERS "The plan did not come as a surprise. Other manufacturers, including Toyota and other carmakers, are most likely to announce restructuring steps along with further cuts in their earnings guidance in the near future. "Such a timely restructuring effort should normally be a positive factor. But any immediate investor reaction would probably be limited as investors are seeking to determine the degree of further earnings guidance downgrades first." HIROAKI OSAKABE, FUND MANGER, CHIBAGIN ASSET MANAGEMENT, TOKYO "The scheme doesn't contain anything new, like a new earnings pillar or a growth strategy. It was something that people had expected, and I think the market had already discounted the announcement. "A sharp cut in its earnings revision is inevitable, but the market will also want to know how much Sony has to post in special losses for the belt-tightening measures." LEE MIN-HEE, ANALYST, DONGBU SECURITIES, SEOUL "The measures appear inevitable as Sony's stronghold -- consumer electronics -- is the hardest-hit by the global downturn among various IT segments. "Japanese electronics makers suffer more than their rivals in South Korea because of the stronger yen. Korean giants like Samsung and LG benefited from the won's sharp depreciation and so far have not come up with large-scale cost-cut plans. "But going forward Korean manufacturers could consider more drastic measures. Even with the weak won, most companies will post losses in 2009." FUJIO ANDO, SENIOR MANAGING DIRECTOR, CHIBAGIN ASSET MANAGEMENT, TOKYO "Like automakers, Sony and rival consumer electronics makers are suffering a disastrous October-December period, including the Christmas shopping season. "The outlook for the global economy suggests that things would become tougher for Sony next year, and it cannot expect a recovery without these restructuring measures. "But I see it as positive that Sony announced these steps now instead of holding off until it gives its October-December results in January." TAKASHI KAMIYA, CHIEF ECONOMIST, T&D ASSET MANAGEMENT, TOKYO "I don't particularly expect an impact on the overall stock market. Its restructuring plans are in line with the recent broader trend in light of the global recession. It's not only Sony, but others such as Toyota are doing the same. "This is not forward-looking restructuring, and it's not as if they could spark more demand. "The only positive news for the markets now is fiscal packages by various governments. Measures such as cutting jobs and mergers are not necessarily positive for them these days." NOBUO KURAHASHI, ANALYST, MIZUHO INVESTORS SECURITIES, TOKYO "Just by reading the release, it is unclear what would be the exact impact for next business year. It's unclear whether this 100 billion yen cost cut is going to be factored in next business year. "The figure is not small by any means, but it seems Sony will need to slash more costs considering that the market conditions are deteriorating by the day. "It is hard to think that this announcement alone will boost Sony shares tomorrow when all electronics stocks are weak, because the restructuring plan lacks details." KATSUHIKO MORI, FUND MANAGER, DAIWA SB INVESTMENTS, TOKYO "The number sounds big, but this staff reduction won't be enough. Sony doesn't have any core businesses that generate stable profits. After the workforce reduction, the next thing we want to see is what is going to be the business that will drive the company. "In that sense, we cannot decide whether this is a positive move or not yet. "Sony's restructuring might be followed by other Japanese manufacturers. With the stronger yen, a lot more companies will probably need to do similar reductions. There will be more mergers, sales of units and restructuring in Japan." AKIHIDE KINUGAWA, CHIEF FUND MANAGER, T&D ASSET MANAGEMENT, TOKYO "Given Japanese electronics makers' strong sensitivity to the yen's strength, poor TV sales and severe earnings prospects amid a deep and long economic recession, plant closures and job cuts are inevitable. "But I still don't know if they can get out of this severe business slump. I expect Sony to sooner or later come up with a sharp downward revision of its earnings outlook for this business year." BACKGROUND: -- Sony had said in October that it would close some plants, reduce capital spending and cut jobs to cope with the tough business environment. (Reporting by  Nathan Layne )
