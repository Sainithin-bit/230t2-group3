 LONDON  (Reuters) - Credit strategists predict another gloomy year in 2009 with a sharp jump in "junk"-rated defaults as companies struggle to refinance in what is expected to be the worst global recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s. But even the most bearish of strategists got their forecasts wrong last year, by failing to predict just how big the blow-out in spreads would be. 

 Spreads on the mostly-junk rated European iTraxx Crossover index, for example, soared this month to a record wide of 1,100 basis points, double that of the widest forecast in a Reuters poll of 12 credit strategists taken a year ago. Following are different house views for 2009. They will be updated as new outlooks become available. CITIGROUP "2008 has been a year that most credit investors will be only too keen to put behind them. But on the face of things, there aren't many reasons to feel much more optimistic about prospects for 2009 as we enter a global recession," Citi strategists say. The bank expects credit spreads to continue to widen in the first half of the year, but say that in valuation terms, investment-grade spreads "compensate for all but truly cataclysmic scenarios on a hold-to-maturity basis." "Simply put, the outlook is pretty horrible, but long-term you are being more than compensated for it. If you can afford to take a longer-term perspective, now is the time to start adding credit exposure gradually." Citi is forecasting negative growth in the United States, UK, Japan and euro area for the whole year and predicts speculative-grade defaults to rise as high as 12 percent, close to the peak of the cycle in the early 1990s. Spreads may turn if technical pressures abate, the bank says. "We think this will happen at some point during 2009, when the hedge fund redemptions are finally done and people looking across asset classes realize the value in credit." DRESDNER KLEINWORT Dresdner Kleinwort strategist Willem Sels does not expect European credit spreads to improve until corporate default rates peak, which will probably happen in the third quarter of next year at 10 to 13 percent. The global junk-grade default rate will then stay elevated for 12 to 18 months after that, with a risk that defaults overshoot that level if liquidity conditions remain tight. "The difference between now and previous credit cycle downturns is that lenders themselves are in bad shape. They will be less willing or be forced to say no more often," resulting in breached loan covenants and unrenewed funding agreements. Nonetheless, Sels is "cautiously optimistic" on credit and predicts reduced forced selling by hedge funds and less aversion by banks to hold inventories will take pressure off further spread widening. Among his main concerns, is how interventionist the new U.S. administration will be. "The further away from the market economy you get, the further you push out the recovery," he said. FITCH RATINGS Fitch forecasts weakening rating profiles particularly in the retail, media and entertainment, chemicals and construction sectors, while the telecommunications, oil and gas, and food sectors will be among the least challenged across EMEA. "We are very much aware of the consumer-exposed industries," director John Hatton said. However, most corporates have sufficient liquidity to see themselves through to post-2010, provided that banks meet their contractual commitments to lend under existing undrawn committed debt facilities, Fitch says. Fitch said distressed companies will not be able to rely on "relationship banking" for additional funding needs as state-supported banks prioritise competing demands upon their existing capital. Fitch forecasts the world economy will grow 0.9 percent next year, with the euro zone and the United States seen contracting by 0.6 percent and 1.2 percent, respectively. ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND RBS says that although a long recession looks priced into current spread levels, heavy new bond supply and rising defaults will further pressure spreads. "We will see fresh wide spreads in 2009 and we believe there is no need to pick out an outright bottom just yet," said RBS credit strategists. Parking cash in senior debt of truly "too big to fail" banks remains one of its top strategies. Investors should not become complacent, however, as governments likely become more discerning about which banks are of systemic importance if further recapitalization is needed, RBS warns. Funding options for companies will remain restrictive in 2009, with issuers in more cyclical sectors increasingly having "to play the relationship card" with its core banks to obtain term funding. RBS economists are forecasting the deepest eurozone recession in more than 50 years. "The conundrum for credit is that, unlike most other markets, it is priced for a pretty awful outcome," with triple-B rated spread levels already pricing in higher default rates than the 15 percent high yield default peak in 1932, the bank said. "Can spreads really peak and, even more importantly, can they really start to narrow when we are not yet at the trough of the economic cycle?" SOCIETE GENERALE SG CIB credit strategists expect European credit spreads to widen further in 2009 as economic growth in the world's major economies slows more than expected, but should gradually tighten in the second half as bank liquidity improves. "Our bank analysts argue that the improvement in liquidity will actually come not from cash injections but rather from shoring up of equity on bank balance sheets," SG CIB said. "This will be a long, slow process, and even at the end of 2009 we are not likely to have a normal interbank market, with the Eonia/Euribor spread back to single digits." SG says default rates will rise to as much as 8 percent for speculative-grade credits, while investment-grade defaults should stay below 1 percent. The bank sees economic growth in the Group of Eight industrialized countries, including China, to slow to almost zero percent in the first half of 2009.
