 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Regulators found shortcomings in how credit rating agencies evaluated structured products such as mortgage-backed securities, the Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Christopher Cox said on Monday. 

 For months the SEC has been scrutinizing credit rating agencies' internal records and e-mail relating to the their ratings of mortgage-backed securities and collaterized debt obligations. "Starting back as far as 2002 the big increase in the volume of business that these firms experienced, trying to rate new kinds of securities ... put a strain on their staff resources," Cox said on CNBC television. "As a result, sometimes they cut corners. We found a number of problems that we think are already being remediated and that we have addressed moreover in our own rules." The SEC recently proposed rules that would require credit raters such as Moody's Corp ( MCO.N ), Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings to disclose information about their past ratings, as well as differentiate between corporate bonds and structured finance products.
