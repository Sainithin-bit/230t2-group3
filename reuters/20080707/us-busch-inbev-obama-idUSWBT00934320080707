 ST LOUIS  (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama said on Monday it would be "a shame" if iconic American brewer Anheuser-Busch ( BUD.N ) was acquired by Belgium's InBev INTB.BR. 

 Obama, speaking at a news conference in the city where Anheuser-Busch is headquartered, said no U.S. law could prevent shareholders from agreeing to sell the company to InBev. The American brewer is known for its Budweiser brand. "I do think it would be a shame if Bud is foreign-owned," Obama said. "I think we should be able to find an American company that is interested in purchasing Anheuser Busch if in fact Anheuser Busch feels that it's necessary to sell." (Reporting by  Caren Bohan )
