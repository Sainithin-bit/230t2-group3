 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc's board remains open to resuming full buyout talks with Microsoft Corp, the company said on Monday after Microsoft revealed it would consider buying all or part of the company if a new Yahoo board were elected. 

 "If Microsoft and Mr. Ballmer really want to purchase Yahoo, we again invite them to make a proposal immediately," Yahoo said in the statement. But Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer told Yahoo his company was no longer interested in buying Yahoo at any price, even after the Internet company's executives approached him about such a transaction, Yahoo said. Billionaire investor Carl Icahn, a major Yahoo shareholder who is running a slate of nominees to replace the existing Yahoo board, said on Monday that Ballmer indicated to him Microsoft's interest in discussing a "major transaction with Yahoo" if the current board was replaced. Yahoo said Ballmer and Icahn's joint efforts to force Yahoo to sell its search business to Microsoft at a price to be determined by Icahn's directors and Microsoft management is not in the best interests of its shareholders. "And if Mr. Icahn has an actual plan for Yahoo beyond hoping that Microsoft might actually consummate a deal which they have repeatedly walked away from, we would be very interested in hearing it," Yahoo said.
