 (Reuters) - The landmark U.S. financial reform law will take years to implement, with hundreds of new rules to be written and dozens of authorities transferred among agencies, some of which must be created from scratch. 

 President Barack Obama signed the legislation into law on July 21, 2010. Here is a timeline for benchmarks in the implementation based on information from Treasury officials and stipulations in the 2,300-page law. IMMEDIATELY UPON BECOMING LAW -- Authority to seize and liquidate large troubled financial firms was granted to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, in consultation with the new Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) headed by Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner. -- The FSOC, which includes the heads of all major surviving financial regulators, plus an independent member appointed by Obama, was formed immediately. It will determine which firms are systemically important and subject to higher capital requirements. -- The Treasury was required to relinquish the ability to authorize new bailouts from the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program. Funds already distributed do not have to be immediately repaid and funds already allocated, such as the rest of the $50 billion in mortgage relief, can still be used. -- The Treasury was required to authorize the Federal Insurance Office to begin work, with an initial staff of around 10 to 15 people. The office will advise the FSOC on systemic risks in the insurance sector and help negotiate international agreements on insurance. -- Investors were now allowed to sue credit rating agencies such as Moody's Corp, Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings if they "recklessly" failed to review information in developing a rating. TWO MONTHS -- The Treasury, in consultation with regulators, was required to set a start-up date for the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the transfer of consumer authorities from existing agencies. Obama named consumer advocate Elizabeth Warren as a special advisor to lead the creation of the agency. Sometime next year, Obama will nominate the bureau's director, who will need Senate confirmation. Until then, the Treasury has the authority to make decisions for the bureau, which will need office space, equipment and staff. At least some employees will come from other regulators. THREE MONTHS -- FSOC must hold its first meeting, scheduled for October 1. The new council replaces the President's Working Group on Financial Markets and takes over any of its remaining work. -- The Commodity Futures Trading Commission must publish an "interim final rule" for how to report data for swaps predating the reform act -- a rule it plans to unveil on October 1. It also must establish timelines on how new swap trades will be reported. SIX MONTHS -- The Securities and Exchange Commission must enact new "say on pay" rules for public company compensation and golden parachutes. After this date, at any public company shareholder meeting, shareholders must be allowed to vote on how frequently they will be given the opportunity to hold advisory votes on company pay. -- The CFTC must set position limits for speculative futures and over-the-counter positions in energy and metals markets. NINE MONTHS -- Regulators must adopt rules requiring securitizers to retain at least 5 percent of the credit risk in any asset they securitize, with exceptions for certain residential mortgages. -- The Federal Reserve must promulgate rules for limiting the fees that debit card issuers can charge merchants. -- The CFTC must establish protections for whistleblowers related to over-the-counter derivatives under the act. ONE YEAR -- Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is expected to assume its full authorities and staffing. -- Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is expected to assume full authorities and personnel from the Office of Thrift Supervision. -- Deadline for new rules governing the bulk of derivatives requirements, what types of swaps are required to be cleared, basic rules and standards for clearing houses and exchange trading of derivatives, and capital and margin requirements for dealers. -- Deadline for regulators to determine whether to exempt small banks, savings associations and farm credit institutions from the new rules on swaps, which require banks to spin off some swaps dealing operations. -- Deadline for SEC rules for mandatory registration of investment advisers to hedge funds and other private pools of capital with assets exceeding $150 million. -- Deadline for SEC adoption of rules requiring all publicly traded companies to have an independent compensation committee. -- The Treasury expects its new Office of Financial Research to be operational, analyzing data on systemic risks in the financial system. -- The SEC's Office of the Investor Advocate is expected to submit its first annual report to Congress. 18 MONTHS -- Some "Volcker Rule" provisions must be in place, such as limits on the scope, scale and limits on mergers and acquisitions that expand a bank's aggregate liabilities by more than 10 percent. -- The Federal Reserve must issue rules that limit debt to equity ratios to no more than 15:1 for large financial institutions. New rules are also due for higher risk-based capital requirements. -- Annual stress tests must begin for financial institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. -- Rules due for financial institution "living wills" that offer investors credible plans for winding down firms that get into trouble. -- Rules for foreign remittances and resolutions of errors in these transfers are required to be in place. TWO YEARS -- "Volcker Rule" provisions restricting banks from "proprietary trading activities" must be in place. These also allow banks to invest only up to 3 percent of their Tier 1 capital in hedge and private equity funds. -- Report and rulemaking on contingent capital for financial institutions due. -- Simplified mortgage disclosure rules must be in place. This is based on a requirement of one year after transfer of authorities of the new consumer agency, which the Treasury expects to be fully up and running by one year after enactment. -- Deadline for the SEC to produce a study to mitigate conflicts of interest at the biggest ratings agencies. If the SEC does not find a solution, the regulator is required to implement a proposal by Senator Al Franken to create a board to match rating agencies with debt issuers. FIVE YEARS -- Banks with more than $15 billion in assets will have to strip trust preferred securities from their Tier 1 capital. (Reporting by  David Lawder ; Editing by  John O'Callaghan )
