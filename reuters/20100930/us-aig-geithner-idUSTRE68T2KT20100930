 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner on Thursday said that a plan by AIG to exit government support means U.S. taxpayers will be in a better position to be repaid for their bailout of the insurer. 

 "The exit strategy announced today dramatically accelerates the timeline for AIG's repayment and puts taxpayers in a considerably stronger position to recoup our investment in the company," Geithner said in a statement issued shortly after AIG announced its plan.
