 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The following are highlights from a Senate Banking Committee hearing on Thursday on financial reform. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, SEC Chairman Mary Shapiro, Treasury Deputy Secretary Neal Wolin, FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair, CFTC Chairman Gary Gensler and acting Comptroller of the Currency John Walsh testify. 

 GENSLER ON NEED FOR MORE FUNDING TO IMPLEMENT RULES: "Though we do have the resources to publish the rules and move forward on the rules, we do recognize we will need significantly more resources about a year from now to actually implement these." SCHAPIRO ON WORKING WITH EU: "The European Union is broadly consistent with Dodd-Frank." "I don't think there is any question about it, when we lead as the largest market in the world other countries look very carefully at what we've done." GENSLER ON MAY 6 SUPPLEMENT REPORT: "Within the next couple of days, I think we'll put out this May 6 supplemental report. There are a lot of lessons in there too." GENSLER ON AGENCY'S PRIORITY FOR FSOC: "One thing that we see over the many months ahead is to designate some clearinghouses to be systemically relevant. We currently oversee 14 clearinghouses, we think that might grow to 20 or so, but some small handful would be so important ... the council would designate them."
