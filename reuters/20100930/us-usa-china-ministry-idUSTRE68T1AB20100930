 BEIJING  (Reuters) - China's Foreign Ministry said on Thursday a U.S. House of Representatives bill that would penalize China for not letting the yuan rise faster could "seriously affect" bilateral relations and economic ties. 

 Spokeswoman Jiang Yu told a regular news briefing that China urged Congress to avoid steps that could harm relations, adding that Beijing was "resolutely opposed" to the bill. The bill would need to be passed by the Senate and signed by President Barack Obama for it to become law. (Reporting by Chris Buckley; Writing by  Ben Blanchard ; Editing by  Ken Wills )
