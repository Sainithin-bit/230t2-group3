 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Boeing Co ( BA.N ) said on Thursday it would delay first delivery of its 747-8 Freighter -- the biggest commercial jet Boeing has ever built -- to mid-2011 from the fourth quarter of 2010 to address issues discovered in flight tests. 

 The company said it would add a fifth airplane to its flight test fleet to help ensure the company meets the new schedule. The latest delay for the 747-8 Freighter is the third announced by Boeing, the world's second largest commercial plane-maker after EADS ( EAD.PA ) unit Airbus. Boeing said the delay is not expected to have a material impact on Boeing's 2010 financial results. "We understand the issues encountered in flight test and are working through the solutions," said Pat Shanahan, vice president and general manager, Airplane Programs, at Boeing Commercial Airplanes.
