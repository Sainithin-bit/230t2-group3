 PARIS  (Reuters) - Automakers clawing back ground after a damaging crisis are increasingly pledging to deepen existing alliances and are looking for new partners to save costs and access new markets. 

 Here are some of the partnerships and plans announced as carmakers prepared for the Paris Auto Show, which opens to the media on Thursday and the public on Saturday. VOLKSWAGEN ( VOWG_p.DE )/ALFA ROMEO ( FIA.MI ) Volkswagen Chairman Ferdinand Piech has set his sights on Fiat's Alfa Romeo brand as a thirteenth brand in his vast automotive empire. Fiat has officially denied any interest in selling. Infiniti, the luxury brand of Nissan, will hold talks with Mercedes-Benz maker Daimler about sharing an existing Daimler sedan car platform and its engines, a senior Nissan executive said. Renault-Nissan and Daimler signed a cooperation accord earlier this year. SAAB SPYKR.AS/BMW ( BMWG.DE ) Loss-making Swedish carmaker Saab is to use BMW engines in a move by Dutch owner Spyker to help boost Saab's recovery and appeal. PSA PEUGEOT CITROEN/MITSUBISH ( 7211.T ) PSA and Mitsubishi agreed to develop electric versions of the Peugeot Partner and the Citroen Berlingo light commercial vehicles in PSA's Vigo factory in Spain. The two groups already work together in some areas and have discussed a capital alliance but said in March they had failed to agree terms. FORD ( F.N )/PSA PEUGEOT CITROEN ( PEUP.PA ) U.S. carmaker Ford and PSA said they would develop a range of diesel engines to comply with new EU regulations, strengthening their existing partnership in that area. RENAULT ( RENA.PA )-NISSAN/GENERAL MOTORS GM.UL Renault and Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn said in a newspaper interview the Renault-Nissan alliance was still interested in closer ties with GM.
