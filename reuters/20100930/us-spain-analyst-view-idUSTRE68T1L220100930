 MADRID  (Reuters) - Spain lost its AAA status on Thursday, ahead of the government presenting a tough 2011 budget to parliament. Moody's Investor Service cut Spain's credit rating to Aa1 from AAA on Thursday, in a move widely discounted by the markets, following cuts by Standard and Poor's in April and by Fitch Ratings in May. 

 MOODY'S COMMENT "The government's determination to reduce its very large fiscal deficit in the near term is an important factor in Moody's decision to limit the downgrade to just one rating notch. "Spain's economy adjustment process is ongoing - household leverage is still high, there's a large overhang of unsold properties and while exports have picked up nicely they are still dependent on what happens in France and Germany. "Portugal is rated A1, quite a way below Spain. Ireland is at Aa2 -- I think this shows you what we think about Spain." ANALYST COMMENT GIADA GIANI, CITIGROUP "The one notch cut was widely expected by the markets. But I would highlight the reference to Spain remaining vulnerable to further market stress, particularly in the context of its debt refinancing needs for 2011 and 2012. "I think the growth forecast of an average 1 pct annually for the coming years is still too high. We see 2011 growth close to flat or even negative for next year." NICOLAS LOPEZ, MG VALORES "A few months ago, Spain was nearly bankrupt (or at least the market thought so) and now it looks like the situation is under control ... I think the spread (Spanish bond against German bund) is excessive at the moment. "Of course nobody has a crystal ball to say when the economy is going to grow and on what basis, but given the situation of Spain's construction sector, which was traditionally a big employment driver, its logical that there are doubts about the outlook for unemployment and economic growth. "With this in mind, the government should focus on what it can manage directly, such as taking structural measures."
