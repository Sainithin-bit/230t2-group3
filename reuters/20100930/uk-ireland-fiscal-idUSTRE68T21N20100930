 DUBLIN  (Reuters) - Ireland on Thursday put the cost of bailing out Anglo Irish Bank under a worst case scenario at 34 billion euros ($46.5 billion) and said it would likely take a majority stake in Allied Irish Banks. 

 Finance Minister Brian Lenihan also said Dublin would aim to slice more than an existing target of 3 billion euros off its 2011 budget and will outline a four year plan in November to get its shortfall to below 3 percent of GDP by 2014. Following are analysts' comments on the plans, aimed to ease market nerves and stop Ireland following Greece into fiscal meltdown. NIELS CHRISTENSEN, CURRENCY STRATEGIST, NORDEA, COPENHAGEN "This is definitely negative news for the euro zone, but it is difficult to surprise the market with negative news on the budget situation in peripheral Europe after all the news we have been through already. We know Ireland is bad, and going from very bad to seriously bad is not a big market mover in the current environment where the focus is so firmly on slower growth and the prospect of QE in the U.S." SEBASTIAN ORSI, ANALYST, MERRION STOCKBROKERS "Obviously these are pretty tough measures in terms of the increased capital requirements (for Allied Irish Banks) but at least they are addressing how it is going to be raised so giving some finality on the numbers and the means for raising it and the timing. "This might provide more confidence. Although people will be concerned about the aggregate numbers and the impact on the state finances of the increased capital requirements." BRIAN DEVINE, ECONOMIST, NCB STOCKBROKERS, DUBLIN "The Anglo figure is pretty much as expected. Allied Irish is more unexpected, but the way they are going to inject it via the pension reserve fund is not actually going to affect the gross debt." "We haven't seen how they are going to reduce the deficit to 3 percent by 2014, which may be taken sceptically by the market. We need to see more details on that front." "How you get to 3 percent from 12 percent (underlying budget deficit before bank rescue costs), that's not an easy feat." CHRISTOPH RIEGER, STRATEGIST, COMMERZBANK, FRANKFURT "The headline of a deficit of 30 percent is somewhat scary. But a look beneath the headlines reveals that there is no funding need from the recapitalisation, so Ireland doesn't have to come to the market and won't for the rest of the year. The newsflow may not be as bleak as some of the headlines. On Moody's downgrade of Spain: "The headline may cause some irritation, Spain is being downgraded. But we expected the downgrade to be delivered today and one notch with a stable outlook is obviously the best downgrade one could get." PADHRAIC GARVEY, RATE STRATEGIST, ING "I think it's bold because what they are doing is really giving us the bad news upfront. I think the market needs to know and here it is." "It's a pretty astonishing deficit number, it's higher than the national debt a few years ago which is an incredible situation to be in. It's dominated of course by accounting practices because the Irish state is taking the pain upfront and funding it slowly over 10 years." "The cancellation of the auctions makes absolute sense. There is no need to fund anyway. That is the carrot for the market, that the Irish are away from the capital markets from a primary perspective until 2011." "I think we are going to see a lot of volatility this morning. The odds are it will be a tough open." (Reporting by Carmel Crimmins and  William James , editing by Patrick Graham)
