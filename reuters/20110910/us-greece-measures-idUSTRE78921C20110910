 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Greece may take additional corrective measures in 2011 to make up for fiscal slippage and meet targets agreed with its international lenders, the country's finance minister told a Greek newspaper on Saturday. 

 "If we need to take measures of an immediate fiscal result in order to meet our targets ... these will be within a just tax system," Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos was quoted as saying by the Kathimerini daily. (Reporting by George Georgiopoulos)
