 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's top two steel makers, Nippon Steel Corp. ( 5401.T ) and JFE Holdings Inc. ( 5411.T ), are expected to report record group profits for the business year ending in March 2008, the Nikkei daily said on Saturday. 

 Pre-tax profit at Nippon Steel, the world's second-biggest steel maker, is set to rise 2 percent to slightly more than 600 billion yen ($5.05 billion), a record for a fourth straight year. JFE, enjoying brisk sales of high-grade steel to car makers, is projected to log a pre-tax profit of 520 billion yen, also up 2 percent, the Nikkei said. JFE will probably raise its dividend for the half-year ending on September 30 to 60 yen, up 10 yen from a year earlier, the newspaper added. A revision in tax rules will result in the two companies booking 28-30 billion yen more in depreciation costs, but that will probably be offset by cuts in spending and growth in sales. Apart from a rise in steel demand from car makers, the companies are also expected to have benefited from higher demand from shipbuilders and equipment manufacturers. ($1=118.71 Yen)
