 KUALA LUMPUR  (Reuters) - Malaysian low-cost carrier Fly Asian Xpress will buy 10 Airbus A330-300 planes and take an option to purchase five more in a deal worth $2.75 billion, a newspaper reported on Saturday. 

 Fly Asian, a sister company of Malaysian budget airline AirAsia ( AIRA.KL ), will take first delivery of the aircraft in September 2008, Business Times reported, without citing its sources. Fly Asian is owned by its chief executive officer, Raja Mohd Azmi, AirAsia chief executive Tony Fernandes and AirAsia deputy group chief executive Kamarudin Meranun. The carrier serves Malaysia's eastern states of Sabah and Sarawak on Borneo island. Asked to comment on the report, Fernandes told Reuters: "Wait till Monday," referring to a press briefing scheduled to be held by Fly Asian on April 23.
