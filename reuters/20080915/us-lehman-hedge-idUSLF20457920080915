 LONDON  (Reuters) - The bankruptcy filing of Lehman Brothers LEH.N is another blow for the hedge fund industry, though the writing has been on the wall long enough for many to have reduced their exposure to the U.S. investment bank. 

 Legendary fund manager George Soros, who runs around $18 billion in assets, looks likely to have had his fingers burned after raising his stake in Lehman to 9.5 million shares in the second quarter. A spokesman for Soros Fund Management declined to comment on the composition of their portfolio. British activist hedge fund Algebris will also probably have taken a hit from the fall in the share price of what was the fourth-largest U.S. investment bank. The hedge fund firm owned just over 4.45 million shares at end-June, Thomson Reuters data show. Algebris sold its stake this year, a spokesman said, declining to give further details. Dealings through Lehman's prime brokerage business were also suspended on Monday, which will have caused problems for some hedge funds, though the industry has been seeking to increase the number of banks they deal with to spread risk. The slump in Lehman's share price is unlikely to have benefited many hedge funds, even though they have the ability to "short" a stock -- which is essentially a bet that makes them money when the share price falls. Many had taken their bets off the table in recent weeks following the spike in bank shares in July, and shorting also becomes more costly as the share price falls, because fewer people are willing to be on the other side of the trade. "At the end of the day, how many hedge fund managers will be shorting Lehman at $3.75, when it's come from $70?" said one fund of hedge funds manager. "Many have been reducing or taking off their short positions over the last few weeks or so." Meanwhile, the slump in markets -- the FTSE 100 closed 3.9 percent lower at 5,204.2 on Monday -- will prove painful for long-short equity funds, most of which are positioned for rising markets. "If you're not a pure financials-focused manager you'll be long something else. You might make money on the shorts, but you'll lose money on something else," the manager said. Lehman's collapse comes during a tough period for the hedge fund industry. HedgeFund Research's HFRI index is down 4.83 percent in the first eight months of the year, having fallen in each of the past three months. PRIME BROKERAGE Administrators said on Monday they had suspended all market trading activity at Lehman Europe, while hedge funds said they were unable to trade, despite being offered prices. "Officially, they are still open for business," an executive at one of London's biggest hedge fund firms said. "In fact they are not trading anything. They might be unraveling trades, but they are not taking any new trades. They are in limbo pending what is going to happen next." Sources in the hedge fund industry on both sides of the Atlantic said Lehman was in stasis. Its private banking unit was not accepting orders, and its foreign exchange execution operation was not allowing trades, even though it was offering prices, they said. One hedge fund manager said the investment bank's broker dealers had been instructed not to trade. Lehman declined to comment on these issues. Winton Capital, one of London's biggest commodity trading advisor (CTA) hedge funds, said on Monday that Lehman had been one of its eight counterparties for foreign exchange trading, but was no longer. "We stopped trading with them last week, and we have no counterparty exposure," a spokesman said. The effect on the hedge fund industry is likely to be limited, given that funds have had months to move their business away to safer rivals. "A lot of people have seen this coming, and I'm sure ... have reduced exposure," said a fund of hedge funds manager who requested anonymity to avoid drawing attention to his firm. Hedge funds have slowly been increasing the number of prime brokers they trade with over the past year to limit exposure to a single counterparty, and this is likely to continue. "This is something we (the hedge fund industry) will all have to look at," David Stewart, chief executive of hedge fund firm Odey Asset Management, told Reuters. (Editing by Will Waterman)
