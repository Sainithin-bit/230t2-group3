 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Electric Co ( GE.N ) shares tumbled for a second straight trading day on Monday to a five-year low as investors scrambled to reduce their exposure to the financial sector following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEH.N. 

 The decline of 5 percent on the day pushed GE's market capitalization to $251.5 billion, $1 billion above that of Microsoft Corp ( MSFT.O ), the third largest U.S. company by market capitalization. "They have exposure to the financials and people are going to react to that. And an international slowdown would not be good for them," said Peter Klein, senior portfolio manager at Fifth Third Asset Management in Cleveland, Ohio, which manages about $20 billion in assets and holds GE shares. "They're pretty liquid and at times like these the most liquid stocks act in a crazy way," he added. The sell-off came despite a letter to GE shareholders posted on the company's Web site on Sunday trying to allay concerns about the Fairfield, Connecticut-based company's financial arm. "Our financial services businesses earned $5.2 billion in the first half of 2008, making us one of the most profitable financial services providers in the world," wrote Trevor Schauenberg, vice president of corporate investor communications. "We have over 10,000 originators around the world and our margins on new business originated this year remain very strong," he said. Schauenberg noted the conglomerate's real estate and mortgage businesses originate loans with the intention of holding them, not selling them. GE's stunning first-quarter profit drop came at the end of a quarter that saw the collapse of Bear Stearns. The company is also trying to sell its $30 billion U.S. private-label credit card business this year. While the company is best known for big-ticket items like jet engines and gas turbines used in power plants, GE makes about half its money from financial services. GE options were also heavily traded on Monday. "Option investors are aggressively positioning for additional downside in the shares," said Henry Schwartz, president of option analytics firm Trade Alert. "Traders expect increasing share- price turbulence." The shares were down $1.49 to $25.25 on the New York Stock Exchange, on a day the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  fell 2.1 percent and the broad Standard & Poor's 500 index  .SPX  was down 1.9 percent. GE is a component of both benchmark U.S. indexes. GE shares are down about 32 percent so far this year. In the past 52 weeks, they have been as high as $42.15 and as low as $23.91.
