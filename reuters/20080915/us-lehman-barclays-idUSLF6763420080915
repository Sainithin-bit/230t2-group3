 LONDON  (Reuters) - British bank Barclays said on Monday it had considered a bid for U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers, but decided not to go ahead. 

 "We confirm that Barclays considered a combination with Lehman Brothers and decided not to proceed because it was not possible to conclude a transaction in the best interests of Barclays shareholders," it said in a statement on Monday. Barclays pulled out of talks to buy parts of Lehman Brothers because it was not willing to guarantee the U.S. bank's trading obligations, a source told Reuters on Sunday. Lehman Brothers, hit by a slump in the value of mortgage-backed assets it held, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Monday after efforts to find a buyer over the weekend failed.
