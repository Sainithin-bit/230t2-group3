 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of big U.S. financial companies sank on Monday, dragged down by growing concern about the health of the financial industry, after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEH.P filed for bankruptcy protection and Merrill Lynch & Co Inc MER.N agreed to be taken over. 

 Among losers, shares of Wachovia Corp WB.N plummeted over 20 percent as investors worried about the high exposure of the fourth-largest U.S. bank to the mortgage crisis. Washington Mutual Inc ( WM.N ) stock slumped 17 percent as anxiety grew about the largest U.S. savings and loan's capital needs and survival prospects. Shares of Citigroup Inc ( C.N ), Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ), JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ), Goldman Sachs Co Inc ( GS.N ) and Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) sank between 4 and 18 percent. Frantic attempts to find a rescuer for Lehman failed over the weekend, and forced the 158 year-old investment bank to file for Chapter 11 protection in Wall Street's highest-profile bankruptcy since junk bond specialist Drexel Burnham Lambert succumbed in 1990. In addition, Bank of America agreed to buy Merrill in an all-stock deal worth about $50 billion, as the world's largest retail brokerage sought refuge from fears that it could be the next victim. "What you are seeing is a general panic among investors ... due to the tremendous uncertainty created by Lehman Brothers over the weekend," said Michael Sheldon, chief market strategist at RDM Financial Group. "The extra decline suffered by Wachovia must surely reflect the pessimism placed on its exposure from a mortgage lending perspective,' said Thomas Russo, principal at Gardner Russo & Gardner. Wachovia has been among the lenders hardest hit by the U.S. housing crisis, following its $24.2 billion purchase of California mortgage specialist Golden West Financial Corp in October 2006, just as the mortgage market was peaking. Last month, the bank decided to close its mortgage lending offices in 16 U.S. states where it has no retail branches, and in three other states where it has few branches. The credit crisis has already forced banks and financial companies to post write-downs and losses close to $500 billion. In the market, the fall was broad and deep for almost all the big financial institutions. Even Bank of America, expected to surpass Citigroup in size with Merrill's takeover, was hit by investors' worries about the price it would be paying for the brokerage. "Strategically, it creates a very strong franchise, but I just question the price paid for the acquisition, given where Merrill could have been this morning without that bid," said Walter Todd, portfolio manager of Greenwood Capital Associates. Wachovia shares fell 21 percent to $11.23, while Washington Mutual stock was down 17 percent to $2.27, and Bank of America shares sank 17 percent to $27.98. Citigroup stock slumped 14 percent to $15.43, Morgan Stanley shares fell 13 percent to $32.51, and Goldman shares were down 11 percent to $136.71. Lehman shares, now trading on the New York Stock Exchange's electronic ARCA platform rather than the Big Board, dropped 95 percent to 20 cents following its bankruptcy filing, while Merrill Lynch gained 15 percent to $19.60 after its agreement to merge into Bank of America. Giant insurer American International Group Inc ( AIG.N ) fell 55 percent to $5.45. AIG, facing a liquidity crises, reached an agreement with New York State allowing it to shift $20 billion from insurance subsidiaries to the parent company.
