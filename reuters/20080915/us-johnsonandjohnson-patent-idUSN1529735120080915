 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - The U.S. District Court in Delaware has reinstated damages awarded to Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ.N ) in a long-running dispute with Boston Scientific Corp ( BSX.N ) and Medtronic Inc ( MDT.N ) over patents on stents used to treat heart disease, J&J said on Monday. 

 U.S. District Court Judge Sue Robinson ordered Boston Scientific and Medtronic to pay J&J's Cordis unit damages originally awarded in 2000, plus interest, for infringement of Cordis' original Palmaz balloon expandable stent patent, J&J said. When the patent infringement cases were originally tried in 2000, Cordis received jury verdicts of $324 million against Boston Scientific and $271 million against Medtronic. After a series of rulings and appeals, both cases were retried in March 2005, with Cordis again prevailing. "We are very pleased that Judge Robinson granted our motion for reinstatement of damages and gratified that this litigation finally appears to be drawing to a close," said Seth Fischer, company group chairman for the Cordis franchise. Stents are tiny wire-mesh tubes inserted into diseased coronary to prop them open after they have been surgically cleared of blockages. "We have been awaiting this ruling for some time, and we took a charge for a portion of this judgment in the third quarter of FY08," a Medtronic spokesman said. "We are also now reviewing the details of the judgment before determining any further steps." A spokesman for Boston Scientific did not immediately have a comment.
