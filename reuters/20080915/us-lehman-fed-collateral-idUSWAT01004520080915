 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve announced a series of steps on Sunday night to boost liquidity and try to avoid widespread market disruptions in the wake of the apparent collapse of efforts to sell Lehman Brothers. 

 The U.S. central bank said it was broadening the type of collateral that financial institutions can use to raise money and now will accept all investment-grade debt securities. Previously, only Treasury securities, agency securities and AAA-rated mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities could be pledged for loans. (Reporting by  Glenn Somerville )
