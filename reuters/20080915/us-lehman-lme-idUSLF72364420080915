 LONDON  (Reuters) - Lehman Brothers was suspended from trading on the Intercontinental Exchange and the London Metals Exchange Select electronic platform on Monday following the bank's application for bankruptcy protection. 

 The U.S. investment bank was suspended from trading on the ICE and LME Select platform after the clearing house, LCH.Clearnet, declared them a "defaulter". In an advisory posted on the LCH.Clearnet website, Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. and Lehman Brothers International Europe were informed: "We hereby declare you to be a 'defaulter' as defined in the LCH Rules and Documentation." A spokesman at the ICE said: "Their membership has been suspended until further notice," due to the decision by LCH.Clearnet. However, while the LME also declared Lehman Brothers a defaulter, suspending the category 2 member from trading on its Select trading platform, the U.S investment bank can still execute telephone trades. "They are suspended from trading on LME Select, but they can still trade on the telephone -- the point being that anything Lehman trades now on the telephone would be subject to them being allowed to do so by their administrator," the LME said. Lehman is one of the biggest investment banks to collapse since 1990 when Drexel Burnham Lambert filed for bankruptcy protection amid a collapse in the junk bond market. A category 2 member of the LME means it has all the privileges of ring dealing members except that it may not trade in the ring.
