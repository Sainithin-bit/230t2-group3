 LONDON  (Reuters) - British bank Barclays said it considered a bid for troubled U.S. rival Lehman Brothers, but decided not to go ahead. 

 "We confirm that Barclays considered a combination with Lehman Brothers and decided not to proceed because it was not possible to conclude a transaction in the best interests of Barclays shareholders," it said in a statement. (Reporting by  Myles Neligan )
