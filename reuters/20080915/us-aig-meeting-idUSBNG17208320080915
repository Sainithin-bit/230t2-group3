 (Reuters) - Executives of insurer American International Group Inc met top New York state officials including Governor David Paterson and insurance and banking regulators over the weekend seeking permission to liquidate assets to raise cash, the New York Post said on Monday. 

 These assets include Manhattan real estate, the newspaper said on its website, citing unidentified sources. AIG on Sunday approached the Federal Reserve seeking $40 billion in short-term financing, to avoid rating downgrades and bolster the capital of its holding company, according to the New York Times.  The company could hold an investor call on Monday, the Wall Street Journal said on Friday. (Reporting by Varsha Tickoo in Bangalore; Editing by  David Holmes )
