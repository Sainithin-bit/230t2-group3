 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - The European Commission said it was confident that central banks and regulators were working on the right response to turmoil in the U.S. financial sector. 

 "We are confident in a good coordination and outcome between the central banks, the regulators and the private sector concerned," a Commission spokesman said, adding the European Union executive had no supervisory role in the matter. Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc filed for bankruptcy protection after trying to finance too many risky assets with too little capital, making it the largest and highest-profile casualty of the global credit crisis.
