 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis said on Monday that his company's deal to buy Merrill Lynch & Co would create a bank that would have taken 10 years to build -- but would also trim near-term earnings. 

 On a conference call with investors, Lewis said the purchase, expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2009, would reduce earnings per share by 3 percent next year. He expects the combined entity to break even in 2010. Bank of America also announced that it would see a $2 billion restructuring charge from the transaction, which values Merrill at $50 billion. Lewis said he expected the deal to cut costs by $7 billion pretax. "This creates the company it would have taken a decade to build," said Lewis. (Reporting by  Elinor Comlay ; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
