 LONDON  (Reuters) - European shares tumbled by midday on Monday with banking stocks bearing the brunt of the falls after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy protection. 

 By 1040 GMT (6:40 a.m. EDT), the FTSEurofirst 300 index fell to its lowest level in nearly two months, down 4 percent at 1,115.92. It is down 26 percent this year, and was on track for its biggest one-day fall since mid-March. The index was a sea of red, with 311 out of the 314 stocks on the index losing ground. Banking stocks led the fallers across Europe, with UBS, HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland, Societe Generale, BNP Paribas and Credit Agricole trading 7-22 percent lower. Lehman filed for bankruptcy protection after trying to finance too many risky assets with too little capital, making it the largest and highest-profile casualty of the global credit crisis. Its shares plummeted more than 80 percent before the opening bell in New York. "I'm not surprised by the fall in the market, given the news. It would have been a different story if Lehman had been taken over. There is greater uncertainty now," said Adrian van Tiggelen, senior strategist at ING Investment Management, in Amsterdam. "The pricing of derivatives and CDOs (collateralized debt obligations) will be at a distressed level at the end of the third quarter, and there will be more profit warnings in the banking sector. There will also be more profit warnings in other sectors, reliant on consumer spending. We are underweight in equities as the lows have yet to be seen," added van Tiggelen. Swiss bank UBS tumbled further after reports it will have to write down another $5 billion on its risky investments in the second half of the year. And BNP Paribas continued to suffer after it revealed it has a $250 million bank loan exposure to the group. Axa SA tumbled 10 percent as a spokesman said its net exposure to Lehman Brothers debt is about 300 million euros. "Lehman's bankruptcy is a very bad news. We had hoped for a rescue of the firm," said Sebastien Barthelemi, analyst at Louis Capital Market. Adding to financial sector woes, the New York Times reported that insurer American International Group had made an unprecedented approach to the Federal Reserve seeking $40 billion in short-term financing working to stave off rating downgrades and shore up the capital of its holding company. AIG officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment. UBS analysts said AIG would likely incur sizable markdowns as the liquidation of Lehman is expected to put substantial pressure on structured finance securities and credit default swaps (CDS). Potentially lending some support to U.S. markets was news that Merrill Lynch agreed to sell itself to Bank of America, becoming the third of Wall Street's big five investment banks to succumb to the crisis after Lehman and Bear Stearns. "The Bank of America purchase of Merrill Lynch looks like good news and is balancing the market for the moment," said Bernard McAlinden, market strategist at NCB Stockbrokers. Merrill shares jumped nearly 35 percent, while Bank of America slipped more than 12 percent. Across Europe, Britain's FTSE fell 3.9 percent, Germany's Dax lost 3.5 percent and France's CAC was down 4.6 percent. COMMODITY STOCKS HIT Commodity stocks slid after crude fell 4.4 percent and copper lost 3 percent as worries about the health of the global economy continued. BG Group, Royal Dutch Shell, Total, BP and ENI were down between 2.7 and 5.4 percent. Anglo American, Antofagasta, BHP Billiton, Lonmin, Rio Tinto and Vedanta Resources were between 4.7 and 8 percent lower. With the financial sector in acute strife, investors will be waiting for action from central banks. The U.S. Federal Reserve is due to announce a rate decision on Tuesday. Fed fund futures showed an 86 percent chance of a 25 basis-point cut. The Chinese central bank acted decisively to prop up the country's slowing economy by cutting the cost of bank loans for the first time since February 2002. U.S. stock futures lost 2.7-3.8 percent, suggesting a shaky start when stocks open for trading. (Additional reporting by  Brian Gorman ; Editing by Quentin Bryar)
