 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) said on Friday it had been contacted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for additional information about its recent restatement of financial results. 

 The automaker said in a statement that it is "voluntarily cooperating" with the "informal inquiries" from the agency's Division of Corporation Finance and the Division of Enforcement. On Tuesday, Ford restated results from the last five years to correctly account for interest rate derivatives used to hedge longer-term debt. Ford said the SEC wants more information about its third quarter report for 2006 and its annual report for 2005 as well as other data. In its restatement, Ford reported a net loss of $5.25 billion in the third quarter, an improvement of about $550 million from the preliminary results released in October. Net income for 2005 was reduced by $600 million to $1.4 billion, the company said in its restatement. Ford also on Friday amended earnings for the first half of this year, saying it lost $1.74 billion compared to the previously reported loss of $1.44 billion.
