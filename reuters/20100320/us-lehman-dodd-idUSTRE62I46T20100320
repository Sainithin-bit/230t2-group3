 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee on Friday wrote to the Justice Department urging establishment of a task force to probe possible violations of the law at Lehman Brothers and other firms. 

 "I am deeply concerned about the facts that have come to light regarding the demise of Lehman Brothers and the accounting manipulation that contributed to it," Senator Christopher Dodd wrote to Attorney General Eric Holder. "I respectfully ask you to commission a task force to investigate the Lehman situation as well as other companies that may have engaged in similar accounting manipulation with a view to prosecution of employees or agents who contributed to any violations of the law," Dodd wrote.
