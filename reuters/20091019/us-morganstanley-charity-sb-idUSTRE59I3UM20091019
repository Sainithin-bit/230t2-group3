 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ), used to duking it out in the financial markets, are now vying in the area of charity. 

 Goldman last week said it had donated $200 million to the Goldman Sachs Foundation, its charitable arm, in what was widely seen as an effort to help quell public outrage over its growing bonus pool. The donation was announced on the same day Goldman reported third-quarter net income of more than $3 billion and set aside more than $16 billion for its year-end bonus pool. For the full year, Goldman is on track to give out an average $630,000 per employee in bonuses, a near-record that has raised hackles among some observers. Morgan Stanley, traditionally Goldman's closest Wall Street rival, is due to report earnings on Wednesday, but on Monday it unveiled its latest charity initiative -- one aimed at feeding hungry children around the world. Its "Step Up to the Plate" program is designed to provide food and medical help for children suffering from acute malnutrition. Morgan Stanley said the initiative follows its "Million Meal Summer," where the company provided meals to children on subsidized meal programs in schools. Morgan Stanley has also set aside billions to pay its people but has not been singled out for criticism like its longtime rival. (Reporting by  Steve Eder ; editing by John Wallace)
