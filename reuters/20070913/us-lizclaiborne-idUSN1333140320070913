 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Liz Claiborne Inc LIZ.N appears to be close to a deal to sell four of its moderately priced clothing brands, the New York Post reported on Thursday. 

 The apparel company put 16 clothing brands up for sale in July, to focus on four others it hopes will reignite profit growth. Citing unnamed sources, the paper said the U.S. arm of Hong Kong-based sourcing and trading company Li & Fung Ltd ( 0494.HK ) has held on-and-off talks with Liz Claiborne about acquiring brands such as Emma James, JH Collectibles, Tapemeasure and Intuitions. Other brands up for sale include Sigrid Olsen, Prana, Ellen Tracy and Dana Buchman. A deal has not been reached and negotiations could still unravel, even though talks have picked up in the last few days, the paper said. A spokeswoman from Liz Claiborne declined to comment on the report, while Li & Fung could not be reached. (Reporting by  Martinne Geller  and  Aarthi Sivaraman )
