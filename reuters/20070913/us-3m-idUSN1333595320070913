 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Diversified manufacturer 3M Co ( MMM.N ) said on Thursday it has agreed to buy a Brazilian maker of orthodontic products for an undisclosed amount. 

 The definitive agreement to buy Abzil Industria e Comercio Ltda., based in Sao Jose do Rio Preto, Sao Paulo, is expected to close in the fourth quarter, said 3M, which makes a range of products including Scotch tape, Post-It notes, Thinsulate insulation and optical films for liquid crystal displays. Abzil, which makes brackets, bands, tubes and wires and employs about 300 people, will complement 3M's dental product line and allow the St. Paul, Minnesota-based company to serve markets in Brazil and beyond, 3M said.
