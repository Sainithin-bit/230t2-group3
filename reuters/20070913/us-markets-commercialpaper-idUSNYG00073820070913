 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The commercial paper market shrank for a fifth straight week but the rate of decline ebbed, a possible sign of life in withered credit markets. 

 Federal Reserve data showed commercial paper outstanding fell just $8.2 billion in the week ending September 12. That was the smallest decline since the start of a credit crunch in early August, and much more subdued than the prior week's $54.1 billion plunge. Things were still far from normal. The total market now amounted to $1.917 trillion, down nearly 14 percent from highs set in late July. Still the smaller retrenchment offered some hope. "To be clear, we are not saying that the crisis is passed," said Marc Chandler, chief global currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman. "This CP report, firmer tone in equities, the easing of volatility in the equity market and the Japanese yen, easing of some money market rates ... point to some relaxation of tensions." Commercial paper is used by companies to raise short-term funding, but has been hit hard as suspicion grows about which financial institutions might hold tarnished assets linked to subprime mortgages. The financial sector's troubles can be traced back to high-risk home loans, which were packaged, repackaged and resold in the secondary market for loans. Amid a rise in mortgage defaults, nobody knows who is holding what and everyone is afraid to take chances. This has effectively paralyzed many sectors of the market for asset-backed securities, although here too the pace of shrinkage had slowed. Asset-backed commercial paper dropped $21.6 billion in the latest week. That was less than the prior week's $31.3 billion tumble, but still left the five-week decline at a staggering $237.8 billion -- nearly a quarter of the total asset-backed market as of late August. Analysts said it was still early to say everything was fine. "I don't have a judgment whether this is a signal the commercial paper market is returning to health, or a quirk of the calendar," said Lou Brien, a strategist with DRW Trading Group in Chicago.
