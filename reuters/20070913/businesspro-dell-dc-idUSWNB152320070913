 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Dell Inc DELL.O said on Thursday it 
is delaying its fiscal 2008 second-quarter report until it has 
completed a financial restatement process. 

  The restatement process could have an impact on the 
quarter's financial statements, the computer maker said in a 
filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Dell said it expects to file the 10-Q for the first and 
second quarters of fiscal 2008 by the first week of November 
2007 or shortly thereafter.  (Reporting by  Robert MacMillan )
