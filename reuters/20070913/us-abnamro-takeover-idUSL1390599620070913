 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - Shareholders in ABN AMRO AAH.AS will weigh three key events in the coming week to decide which of two rival bidders will clinch control of the Dutch bank after a six-month takeover battle. 

 A 71 billion euro ($98.70 billion) offer from a consortium led by Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ) is 11 billion euros higher than a rival offer from Barclays ( BARC.L ). But ABN's share price has been stubbornly stuck between the two offers, reflecting investors' uncertainty over who will win. On Thursday, ABN shares were trading near 35 euros, above the value of Barclays' mostly-share offer of 32 euros but below the three-bank consortium's mostly-cash offer of 38 euros. Three events will help shareholders decide on a winner: regulatory authorities are due to rule on the consortium's offer, ABN's management is expected to indicate its stance on the two bids and shareholders will be given the opportunity to ask questions and hear ABN management's views on the proposals. The consortium, which also comprises Fortis FOR.BR and Santander ( SAN.MC ), is gaining acceptance among investors and even within ABN and Barclays as the likely winner. But it must first clear regulatory approval by the Dutch Finance Ministry, which is expected by the deadline of September 17. Barclays got approval in August and shareholders will have until the first week of October to submit shares to either party. "The consortium of Fortis, RBS and Santander, they will likely win the battle," said Jaap Koelewijn, a Dutch financial consultant and professor, "One hiccup is the financing, which one way or another, the consortium has to arrange." Although the consortium is making a cash-rich offer for ABN, they have yet to raise the cash. Most keenly watched is a 13 billion euros rights issue by Fortis. The issue has been high on investors' minds because the recent credit squeeze has raised the cost for banks seeking to raise money, and a deeply discounted share issue by Fortis could get a lukewarm response if conditions worsen any further. On the other hand, Barclays all but conceded defeat this week when its president, Bob Diamond, said that if the consortium raises funds and sticks to its offer price, "then that price will probably beat ours". ABN itself is due to weigh in on the bids ahead of its September 20 extraordinary shareholders meeting, possibly over the coming weekend. In July, ABN's management took a neutral stance on the bids, after initially supporting the Barclays offer. Herman Bots, analyst at Amsterdam-based private bank Theodoor Gilissen, said that ABN's management would keep its neutral stance on the two bids. "They prefer Barclays, but will likely acknowledge that the consortium's bid is superior," Bots said. Whether either bidder prevails, the multi-billion euro merger would set a record as the biggest-ever banking merger. Both Barclays and the consortium want to expand as the European market consolidates. Barclays wants to merge with ABN and keep the headquarters in Amsterdam, while the consortium wants to break up the bank amongst themselves.    (Additional reporting by  Gilbert Kreijger )
