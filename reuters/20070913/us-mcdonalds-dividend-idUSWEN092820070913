 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - McDonald's Corp. ( MCD.N ) on Wednesday raised its annual dividend by 50 percent as part of a plan to return up to $17 billion to shareholders through 2009, sending its shares up more than 2 percent. 

 The world's largest restaurant company said its board of directors declared a 2007 cash dividend of $1.50 a share, up from $1 a share last year. It is payable on December 3 to shareholders of record as of November 15. The new payout brings McDonald's dividend yield to 2.9 percent, well above the average dividend yield of 0.98 percent for companies in the Standard & Poor's Consumer Discretionary index .GSPD McDonald's yearly dividend is now more than six times what it was in 2002, the year before the company launched an aggressive turnaround that included putting the brakes on its rapid expansion and focusing on improving results at existing locations with new menu items, extended hours and cashless payments. That effort has revitalized sales and profits at the company's more than 30,000 hamburger restaurants and helped triple its stock price since the beginning of 2003. McDonald's said it would return between $15 billion and $17 billion in cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks from 2007 through 2009, a commitment that appeared to mark a significant increase from the company's prior plan of returning $5.7 billion in 2007 and 2008. One investor said McDonald's move may prompt other companies to return more cash to shareholders. "Other companies will sit up and notice," said Fred Dickson, market strategist and director of retail research at D.A. Davidson & Co. in Lake Oswego, Oregon. "Institutional investors who have significant positions in other companies will probably remind those companies sitting on cash that they might be doing their shareholders a favor by accelerating share repurchases." McDonald's had bought back $2.4 billion in shares this year as of the end of August, it said. "Our business momentum, strong stable cash flow, borrowing capacity and anticipated future capital needs reinforce our view that cash available for dividends and share repurchase will continue to grow," McDonald's Chief Executive Jim Skinner said in a statement. Skinner also said McDonald's would be able to maintain a "strong credit rating." In July, Skinner said on a conference call with analysts that McDonald's was focused on ways to increase its free cash flow so it could return more cash to shareholders. Selling more restaurants to franchisees, which minimizes McDonald's capital investment and insures a stable royalty stream, is one way the company is doing that, Skinner said at the time. The Oak Brook, Illinois company also said in July that it was looking into borrowing more and would make a decision about a possible increase in its debt level this fall. McDonald's shares rose to $52.30 in extended trade after closing at $51.20 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by Nichola Groom; additional reporting by Chris Sanders)
