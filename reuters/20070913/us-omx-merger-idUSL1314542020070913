 STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - OMX's OMX.ST founder said a merger with Nasdaq ( NDAQ.O ) would strengthen the market for Nordic shares, though a rival offer from Borse Dubai offer also needed to be seriously considered. 

 Faced with increasing consolidation among European exchanges and a new regulatory framework, a merger would stave off the risk of the Nordic exchange becoming marginalized, its honorary chairman Olof Stenhammar wrote in business daily Dagens Industri on Thursday. "The proposed merger of OMX and Nasdaq would strengthen the market for Nordic shares, in part due to the distributive power that Nasdaq can offer in the world's biggest capital market," he said in the article. "I am convinced that the proposed deal will create value for OMX's shareholders and investors in the Nordic market." In May, Nasdaq launched an agreed bid worth $3.7 billion in cash and shares for OMX, which runs exchanges in Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Iceland and the Baltic states. But a bid battle erupted as Borse Dubai, a holding company for government stakes in Dubai Financial Market DFM.DU and Dubai International Financial Exchange (DIFX), made a rival $4 billion cash offer last month. Borse Dubai controls 28.4 percent of OMX, mainly through share options. Stenhammar said Borse Dubai's offer needed to be seriously considered as it did "not lack industrial logic" though some "formalities" appeared not to have been carried out properly in connection with it making the bid. Sweden's Securities Council said this week that Borse Dubai had breached best market practice in the way it announced its acquisition of OMX shares and its subsequent bid for the firm. "I will myself not take a stand (on the bids) until the final prospectuses have been presented," he said. Stenhammar also dismissed recent nationalistic arguments for keeping OMX in Swedish hands, calling that strain of opinion "curious and unfortunate". "When we Swedes take control in other countries then it is all fine. The opposite isn't, apparently," he said. Separately, OMX late on Wednesday refuted media reports that some of its top executives had been granted favorable conditions for employment if Nasdaq's agreed bid for OMX brought about a merger of the two firms. "No agreement has been entered into between any person in the management of OMX and Nasdaq," the firm said in a statement.
