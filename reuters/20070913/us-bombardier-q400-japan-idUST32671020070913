 TOKYO  (Reuters) - All Nippon Airways Co. (ANA) ( 9202.T ) said on Thursday it had suspended all flights using 14 Q400 aircraft made by Canada's Bombardier Inc ( BBDb.TO ) after the Canadian government said the craft must be inspected. 

 Bombardier, the world's third-largest maker of civil aircraft, asked airlines worldwide on Wednesday to ground 60 of its turboprop planes for inspections after landing gear failures forced two planes to make crash landings in the last couple of days. ANA suspended 19 flights on Thursday morning and does not know when it will resume services using Q400s, ANA spokeswoman Keiko Ninomiya said. Fellow carrier Japan Airlines Corp 9205.T said it had grounded all 10 of its aircraft of the same model earlier in the day but some are now up and flying after having been inspected. The airliner suspended flights using three aircraft on Wednesday. Japan has a total of 24 of the aircraft concerned, an official at the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport said.
