 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Boeing Co ( BA.N ) booked orders for 75 commercial planes in August, compared to 25 for Europe's Airbus, propelling the U.S. planemaker ahead of its main rival in the annual race for orders. 

 Boeing, which is dominating the market for widebody planes with its carbon composite 787 Dreamliner, had 841 orders as at September 5, adjusted for cancellations. Airbus, which does not adjust for cancellations until the end of the year, had 713 orders at the end of August. The figures are from the companies' Web sites. Despite a strong start to September for Airbus -- which in the past week announced new orders from Czech Airlines, Hong Kong Airlines and U.S. lessor Aviation Capital Group -- rival Boeing still seems set to clinch the title of biggest-selling plane maker for the second year running. Strong orders for the two companies combined, which may yet break 2005's record of more than 2,000, indicate that airplane demand remains strong, and so far unaffected by problems in the credit markets, according to analysts.
