 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A Louisiana federal judge on Thursday sentenced Honeywell International Inc ( HON.N ) to two years probation and a criminal fine of $8 million related to a 2003 incident in which a toxic chemical killed a Honeywell employee, the U.S. Department of Justice said. 

 Honeywell was sentenced after pleading guilty before U.S. District Court Chief Judge Ralph Tyson to one count of negligently causing the release of hazardous air pollutants and negligently placing another person in imminent danger of death, the Justice Dept. said in a release. Judge Tyson also ordered the company to pay $2 million to three children of the fatally stricken employee of the Baton Rouge Honeywell plant, and $2 million in community restitution.
