 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Staples Inc ( SPLS.O ) said on Thursday that its board of directors will propose to amend the retailer's charter to remove provisions requiring that holders of at least two-thirds of voting shares, rather than a simple majority, approve significant corporate transactions. 

 The proposed amendment, which was requested by a shareholder in June, is expected to be submitted for shareholder approval at the company's 2008 annual shareholder meeting -- where it will require approval by at least two-thirds of voting shares.
