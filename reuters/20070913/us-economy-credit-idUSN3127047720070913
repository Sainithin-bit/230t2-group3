 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Crippled credit markets earned some reprieve on Thursday as a key bank borrowing rate receded and the pace of deterioration in commercial paper issuance showed signs of abating. 

 Wall Street also found encouragement in news that Countrywide Financial Corp CFC.N, the troubled U.S. mortgage lender, had lined up $12 billion to help cope with a housing downturn that has stifled lending in many areas of the economy. The emergence of partial financing for a buyout of Alliance Boots AB.UL provided additional evidence that market conditions, while nowhere near normal, were becoming less rigid. A recent spike in the London Interbank Offered Rate, known as LIBOR, had fanned worries about costlier financing and raised fears that central banks like the Federal Reserve might be powerless to soothe anxious markets. As LIBOR rates retreated, investors grew more hopeful that a widely expected monetary easing by the Fed next week will go some way toward redressing the crisis. "Lower LIBOR rates are making people think the crisis is getting better, not worse," said Rick Klingman, managing director of U.S. Treasury trading at BNP Paribas. The Bank of England relaxed rules on banks' reserve requirements and the U.S. Federal Reserve conducted money market operations to the tune of $21 billion, with both monetary authorities looking to free up liquidity and getting money markets functioning smoothly again. This had the desired effect, traders said, in that money market rates eased. Indeed, the combination of factors was enough to send stocks sharply higher, with the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  rallying over 1.2 percent. Bond prices slid as investors backed away from almost fully pricing in a half percentage point interest rate cut from the Fed on Tuesday. Compounding such market moves was Federal Reserve data showing a decline in commercial paper outstanding, while still considerable, was abating. Federal Reserve data showed commercial paper outstanding fell just $8.2 billion in the week ending September 12. That was the smallest decline since the start of a credit crunch in early August, and much more subdued than the prior week's $54.1 billion plunge. This was hardly business as usual. The total market now amounted to $1.917 trillion, down nearly 14 percent from highs set in late July. Still the smaller retrenchment offered some glimmers of improvement. "To be clear, we are not saying that the crisis is passed," said Marc Chandler, chief global currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman. "This CP report, firmer tone in equities, the easing of volatility in the equity market and the Japanese yen, easing of some money market rates ... point to some relaxation of tensions." Commercial paper is used by companies to raise short-term funding, but has been hit hard as suspicion grows about which financial institutions might hold tarnished assets linked to subprime mortgages. Asset-backed commercial paper, the area most deeply affected by the credit crunch, dropped $21.6 billion in the latest week. That was less than the prior week's $31.3 billion tumble, but still left the five-week decline at a staggering $237.8 billion -- nearly a quarter of the asset-backed commercial paper market's late August total.
