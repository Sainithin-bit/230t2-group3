 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday filed fraud charges against hedge fund manager Robert Berlacher and the Lancaster group of hedge funds, alleging they engaged in an illegal trading scheme involving at least 10 unregistered securities offerings. 

 The SEC charged that Berlacher implemented an unlawful scheme from 2000 through 2005 that helped Lancaster realize more than $1.7 million in illegal gains by investing in private-investment-in-public-equities (PIPE) offerings. In a PIPE deal, an underwriter sells a company's restricted shares, while the company agrees to file paperwork with regulators allowing investors to resell those shares to the public. According to the SEC's complaint, Berlacher and Lancaster, after learning about a PIPE transaction, sold short the issuer's stock. Once the SEC declared the resale registration statement effective, Berlacher and Lancaster would use the PIPE shares to cover the short position, which is prohibited by federal securities laws, the SEC said. Nick Morgan, an attorney representing the defendants, said, "We anticipate vigorously contesting the allegations." The SEC said the defendants used deceptive trading techniques to make it appear they were covering their short sales with open market shares. Also, on at least one occasion, the defendants engaged in illegal insider trading by selling short the PIPE securities before the public announcement of the offering, while using nonpublic information they received when being solicited to invest in the PIPE, the SEC said. "We've been devoting substantial resources to investigating unlawful trading practices by hedge funds and other investors in PIPE deals, including cases involving insider trading and other deceptive trading schemes," Scott Friestad, associate director of enforcement at the SEC, told Reuters. The SEC is seeking civil penalties and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains from the defendants.
