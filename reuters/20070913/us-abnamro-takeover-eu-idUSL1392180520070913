 BRUSSELS/AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - The European Commission has extended the deadline for its antitrust review of the takeover of parts of Dutch bank ABN AMRO AAH.AS by Belgian-Dutch financial group Fortis FOR.BR by two weeks to October 3. 

 Fortis is in a consortium with Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ) and Spain's Santander ( SAN.MC ) to try to take over ABN AMRO for 71 billion euros ($98.7 billion), competing with a bid from Britain's Barclays ( BARC.L ), which is about 11 billion euros lower. The deadline was extended so proposed remedies to competitive difficulties with the case could be vetted by competitors and customers, a Commission spokeswoman said. ABN shares closed up 2.7 percent at 35.19 euros on the view that Fortis, which plans to take over ABN's Dutch activities, is working with regulators to work out a deal. The DJ Stoxx European bank index .SX7P rose 0.7 percent. The rally in ABN shares erased part of their discount to the consortium's offer, which is worth 37.90 euros per ABN share. Barclays' offer is worth 31.91 euros and ABN's share price has been stubbornly stuck between the two offers, reflecting investor uncertainty over the winner. "ABN has been rising today as the extension of the review period shows that Fortis is seriously working on the takeover," said Renate Brand, analyst at FBS Bankiers. A Fortis spokesman said the remedies were in the domain of small and medium-sized enterprises and that an extension for a review was not unusual. "We are still confident that we will get clearance before the end of the offer period," the Fortis spokesman said. The consortium's offer is open until October 5, a day after the Barclays offer closes. Analyst Herman Bots from Dutch private bank Theodoor Gilissen said the extension of the review period indicated the European Commission could demand concessions from Fortis and he thought Fortis could get a dominant position on the Dutch private banking market when taking over ABN's Dutch operations. For Fortis' partners RBS and Santander, who each sought permission separately, the review period was not extended beyond September 19.
