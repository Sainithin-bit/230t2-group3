 ATLANTA/LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Retailer Target Corp ( TGT.N ), which has been under pressure from activist investor Bill Ackman to boost its stock price, said on Wednesday it was considering selling $7 billion in credit-card assets and would evaluate its pace of share repurchases. 

 The company's shares rose 2.2 percent to $64.11 in extended trading after the announcement. Chief Financial Officer Doug Scovanner said in the statement the company would look to determine whether it or a financial institution was better suited to own the credit-card assets, which include the Target Visa Card and Target Credit Card and other financial products. Goldman Sachs is advising the review. The moves come two months after hedge fund investor Ackman disclosed a 9.6 percent stake in the discounter, saying Target needed to take steps to increase its share price. Analysts had speculated that Ackman would pressure Target to sell off its credit card portfolio or real estate assets. Ackman was not immediately available for comment. One investor, who said she met with Scovanner and other members of Target's management two weeks ago, said she thought the review was meant to prove to Ackman and others on Wall Street that the credit card assets were indeed worth keeping. "It would have been impossible to not note how passionately Doug Scovanner believed that they are right, that it does not make economic sense for them to get rid of this credit card portfolio," said Patricia Edwards, a portfolio manager with Wentworth, Hauser and Violich in Seattle, which owns about 490,000 Target shares. "They need to prove to Wall Street what they know, and then the whole thing can be put to rest," she added. LOOKING AT BUYBACKS, DEBT The Minneapolis retailer also said it would examine its use of debt and the pace of current and possible future share repurchases. Should any or all of the credit-card receivables be sold, the capital structure review would also include an analysis of how it should spend those proceeds, it added. Many companies have ramped up their share buybacks this year. For example, home improvement retailer Home Depot Inc ( HD.N ) said on Monday that it now expects a lower profit decline for 2007 than it previously projected, reflecting the benefit of a just-completed $10.7 billion share repurchase. Target officials were not immediately available for further comment, but Scovanner said in a statement that the company was committed to maintaining its investment-grade credit ratings. "Target expects to maintain the necessary credit profile to preserve our long-term debt ratings within the 'A' category," Scovanner said. STRONG GROWTH Target is one of the last major U.S. retailers to have kept its credit assets, which brought in $453 million, or about 3 percent of total revenue, in the most recent quarter. Department store chain Dillard's Inc ( DDS.N ) sold its credit card subsidiary to GE Consumer Finance in 2004, and Sears, Roebuck & Co ( SHLD.O ) and Circuit City CC.N have made similar moves in recent years. "Regardless of whether or not our review results in a receivables sale, we intend to maintain our core financial services operation," Target's statement added. Target ranked as the tenth largest issuer of Visa and MasterCard cards as of June 30, with volume of $6.1 billion, according to the Nilson Report, which tracks the industry. By contrast, Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) ranked No. 1, with volume of $146.4 billion. David Robertson, publisher of the Nilson Report, said Target could be weighing options for the credit assets given forecasts of a slowing economy in wake of the soft U.S. housing market and recent credit crunch. "Target has had a good long run at generating profits from its card business," Robertson said. He added that any economic downturn would hurt Target's portfolio, which he said does not have as broad a cross-section of customers as those of larger credit competitors such as Bank of America and Citigroup Inc  ( C.N ). "My assumption would be as they look forward, they don't see the profitability of the program staying as strong as it has been," Robertson added. Target "would certainly have a number of issuers willing to purchase, including Citi, Chase and GE," Robertson said. (Addition reporting by Joe Giannone in New York)
