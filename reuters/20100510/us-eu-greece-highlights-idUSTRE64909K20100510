 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - The following are comments by European Union finance ministers and other officials on Sunday concerning their meeting to agree on a mechanism aimed at preventing Greece's debt turmoil spreading to other countries. 

 THE FOLLOWING COMMENTS WERE MADE AFTER THE MEETING ECONOMIC AND MONETARY AFFAIRS COMMISSIONER OLLI REHN "This is not only about Greece but about stability in Europe as a whole." "(It is a) full and strong commitment to anticipate fiscal consolidation by member states, particularly for countries that have been under speculative attacks in recent weeks. They need to take action now. In this instance, I'm satisfied Portugal and Spain have expressed a clear commitment to take significant new measures." "The fiscal efforts of the EU member states, the financial assistance by the Commission and by the member states, actions taken today by the ECB prove we shall defend the euro whatever it takes." "They (ECB actions) are indeed very significant." "Interest rates .. would be in the same magnitude as in the case of Greece. The price by and large follows the same logic as in the case of Greece." "The ECB has taken a decision to intervene in the secondary market of government securities." "60 billion euros would be first in line to be used... possible use of special purpose vehicle of up to 440 billion euros. The case of Greece is a benchmark for how quickly it would be activated... (It could take) some weeks to be fully operational." "The key difference is that the 60 billion euros that we have at our disposal on the basis of the community budget... that is managed according to the normal community rules." "In parallel, if needed there is available up to a volume of 440 billion euros, which the member states in the Ecofin decided to channel through a special purpose vehicle that is guaranteed by participating member states in a coordinated manner, and the Commission is tasked to do the management of this and also ensure conditionality, of course with the ECB and in cooperation with the IMF." "If needed, we will use these elements according to this legal basis -- the legal base for this 440 billion is an intergovernmental mechanism between the member states." "When we talk about the 60 billion euros... for the moment there is no need and I trust that our actions overall will have such an impact that there will not be a need. But if we have a need we have the 60 billion available with strict conditionality as loans, in the same way we have with Greece at the moment on the basis of the previous decision." "To be clear and specific, concerning the 400 billion, if there's a need to use that, if the member states decide to use it on the basis of rigorous conditionality this would be conducted through what the experts call a special purpose vehicle that is guaranteed by participating member states, and it would channel this as loans in the same way as we do the 60 billion. So in a way the origin is different, but after the channeling the method is the same if requested and needed and decided to be used." SPANISH ECONOMY MINISTER ELENA SALGADO "Themain purpose of Ecofin was to set up a mechanism to stabilize the euro area in particular, to preserve financial stability in Europe in general." "We discussed a joint package for Greece in the last few days... The Commission has signed a loan agreement with Greece. The first payment will be possible before May 19, as planned." "The Council is fully committed to fiscal stability... We are committed to boosting economic growth in all member states." "Structural reforms, consolidation for public finances will be accelerated... The most important thing today is the creation of a European stabilization mechanism." "We will continue to look at a transaction tax. We refer to the need to speed up crisis management." "Exceptional circumstances needed exceptional reaction." "It sets out the possibility of financial support for member states that have difficulties caused by exceptional occurrences beyond their control. We believe that such exceptional circumstances now pertain. We therefore believe that such a mechanism can now be used." "This takes us up to 60 billion euros, to be put to this use in a coordinated manner, again coordinated between the EU and IMF." "On top of this, the euro area member states may complement such resources through a special purpose vehicle. This SPV is guaranteed on pro rata basis by participating member states in a coordinated manner, and that would be over a period of 3 years, respecting all the national requirements and procedures that all the member states involved would require." "The additional amount we are talking about is up to a value of 440 billion euros. To this amount a contribution of the IMF may be added. It is going to be half of the contribution of the euro area, and that means an extra up to 220 billion euros from the IMF. It would be half of the contribution again." "It shows through this decision that we are placing considerable sums in the interest of stability in Europe. Our conclusions also reiterate yet again the need for progress to be made on regulating the financial system, on oversight and the supervision of the financial system, in particular derivatives and the role of rating agencies" "Fiscal consolidation must be given greater importance in activity of the member states... The crisis has shown that we need to coordinate economic policy better, we need to speed up that process. GERMAN INTERIOR MINISTER THOMAS DE MAIZIERE "Consolidation (of budgets) will be increased and sharpened. Affected states have committed to a substantial increase in consolidation. The package includes a European instrument of 60 billion euros, covered with EU guarantees. Package amounts to ... up to 500 billion euros. The IMF has said it will participate. The package will be implemented through a special purpose vehicle. We will increase the regulation of financial markets. The situation will be calmed down." POLISH FINANCE MINISTER JACEK ROSTOWSKI "The decision by ECB to intervene was a good one, and like any good decision it should have been made sooner." THE FOLLOWING COMMENTS WERE MADE BEFORE THE MEETING SWEDISH FINANCE MINISTER ANDERS BORG "There is a need for stronger measures, where we stand together to strengthen the stability of the financial markets here in Europe. We need to make progress today... "We now see herd behaviors, that are really pack behaviors, wolfpack behaviors, and if we will not stop these packs, even if it is self-inflicted weakness, they will tear the weaker countries apart. So it's very, very important that we now make progress, both when it comes to consolidation not only long term but short term consolidation, but also when it comes to a common facility to deal with the urgent problems." BRITISH FINANCE MINISTER ALISTAIR DARLING Speaking to BBC in Brussels: "I think it is important that we do everything we can to stabilize the markets, to show that we are coming through one of the difficult periods, and that we are prepared to do what is necessary to ensure that we have that stability." "Now the meeting today has been called because it's necessary to make sure that in one or two countries' cases we are doing the right things. Support is being provided from the appropriate quarter in order to make sure that we stabilize the situation, that we can continue with the recovery." Asked how far was Britain prepared to go to offer support: "Well, firstly, the responsibility for supporting the euro and the Eurogroup countries lies with the members. Now we are not one of them, but it is clearly in our interest that everything is done in Europe to try and stabilize the situation." "But I am very, very clear that if there is a proposal to create a stability fund for the euro, that has got to be a matter for the Eurogroup countries, as it was in the case of Greece." "It's in all our interests ... to make sure that whatever is agreed is in place quickly because it's in all of our interests that those countries that may have difficulties have those difficulties resolved as quickly as possible." "What we will not do and what we can't do is provide support for the euro, that's got to be for those countries that use the euro, that are members of the Eurogroup." "The responsibility for supporting the euro must be for the Eurogroup members. When they went into the euro they knew exactly what the score was." "We need to show again today that by acting together we can stabilize the situation, we do not want to jeopardize the recovery that is slowly taking place. And we will play our part in that." "But when it comes to supporting the euro, obviously that is for the euro zone countries."
