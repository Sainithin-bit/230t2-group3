 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. job market strengthened in April for the eighth straight month but at a slower rate, in anticipation of economic activity moderating in coming months, a research group said on Monday. 

 The Conference Board, a private research group, said its Employment Trends Index rose to 94.7 in April from a downwardly revised 93.9 in March, which was originally reported at 94.4. "Going forward, we do not expect job growth to accelerate much beyond this month's rate, as the overall increase in economic activity is likely to moderate during the second half of 2010," said Gad Levanon, Associate Director, Macroeconomic Research at The Conference Board. On Friday, government data showed U.S. employment grew at the fastest pace in four years in April. (Reporting by  John Parry ; Editing by  Chizu Nomiyama )
