 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - European Union finance ministers agreed Monday on emergency measures worth 500 billion euros ($670 billion) to prevent Greece's debt crisis causing turmoil in other euro zone countries, EU sources said. 

 The measures are worth much more than any previous attempts by the 27-country EU or the 16-state single-currency group to calm what one minister described as the "wolfpack" of the financial markets. "It's done. We have a deal. It will be a package of 500 billion euros. It will consist of a mix of loans and loan guarantees," one EU diplomat said.
