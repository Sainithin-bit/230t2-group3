 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Pending sales of previously 
owned homes fell 1 percent in March, as expected, as turmoil in 
the housing and mortgage markets continued, a real estate trade 
group report on Wednesday showed.
   
KEY POINTS: 
* The National Association of Realtors Pending Home Sales 
Index, based on contracts signed in March, fell 1 percent to 
83.0 and was 20.1 percent lower than the March 2007 index. 
* Economists were expecting the decline in these contracts, 
which are a good barometer of future home sales. 
* The association's chief economist, Lawrence Yun, said the 
availability of affordable mortgages is uneven, contributing to 
the slowdown. 
COMMENTS: 
CARLEY GARNER, SENIOR ANALYST, ALARON TRADING, LAS VEGAS: 

 "Knowing the situation in the housing market, I don't see 
any major surprises. The number came in line with market 
expectations. The Treasury market had priced that in beforehand 
and that is why you got a little bit of a bid going into the 
number, which faded once the news was reported. We are seeing 
more technical trades than fundamental trades at this point." 
KEVIN LOGAN, SENIOR U.S. ECONOMIST, DRESDNER KLEINWORT, NEW 
YORK: "The clampdown on all these Alt-A mortgages -- you can't 
get 100 percent loan-to-value mortgages anymore -- and falling 
home prices, are going to keep the housing market in the 
doldrums for quite a while." 
MARTY MITCHELL, HEAD OF GOVERNMENT BOND TRADING, STIFEL 
NICOLAUS, BALTIMORE: "Frankly the housing story is pretty much in the market at 
this point and I am not seeing much of a reaction off that 
number." "There is curve steepening into the refunding. We've 
steepened about 20 basis points from the lows we put in on 
Friday." "It is all supply related. It's going to bring 10s today 
and 30s tomorrow." 
DAVID WYSS, CHIEF ECONOMIST, STANDARD & POOR'S RATINGS 
SERVICES, NEW YORK: "This is not a shock. The pace of sales seems to be 
stabilizing but that's the best you could say about it. But I 
don't think we've hit a bottom yet." "Combining this with the other data, the housing market is 
continuing downward and it won't bottom until this summer or 
some time in Q3." 
STEVE GOLDMAN, MARKET STRATEGIST, WEEDEN & CO, GREENWICH, 
CONNECTICUT: "The pending home sales number was not a surprise. It was 
in line. I'm not sure it had any bearing on the market other 
than the fact that the market has had an 11 percent rally, and 
came to about 9 percent away from news highs, and we could have 
profit-taking given the rally we've been in." 
PIERRE ELLIS, SENIOR ECONOMIST, DECISION ECONOMICS, NEW YORK: "The report was reassuringly close to expectations which 
will encourage more confidence that the market for existing 
homes has stabilized. But there is still a problem of enormous 
inventories that will keep downward pressure on prices and 
there is a lingering risk that a deflation mentality will make 
people hesitate to buy." 
MARKET REACTION: 
* BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices hold gains. 
* CURRENCIES: U.S. dollar holds gains against yen and euro. 
* STOCKS: U.S. equity indexes hold losses. 
* RATE FUTURES: U.S. short-term interest rate futures rise 
slightly, point to 16 percent chance of June rate cut versus a 
14 percent chance before the data.
