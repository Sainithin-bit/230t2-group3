 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ), which is buying Bear Stearns Cos BSC.N, expects to regain business from Bear clients who stopped doing business with the troubled investment bank, JPMorgan's co-chief executive of investment banking said on Wednesday. 

 Bill Winters, speaking on a webcast conducted by Deutsche Bank Securities Inc, also said both banks will cut investment banking jobs in light of tight capital markets and an economy and housing prices that have not "rounded the bend." "You couldn't create a worse backdrop for an investment banking merger," Winters said. "We would have been downsizing right now. Bear would have been downsizing right now. By virtue of the combination, we certainly will be downsizing." Winters said new business activity at Bear has been "severely reduced," but there is "every indication" that clients will return after the merger closes. JPMorgan agreed in March to buy Bear for $10 per share, in a purchase brokered in part by the U.S. Federal Reserve. The central bank agreed to back $29 billion of Bear's assets. The merger is expected to close this quarter. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel, editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
