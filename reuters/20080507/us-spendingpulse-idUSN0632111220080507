 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Consumer spending on apparel and footwear during April may appear stronger than in March, but gains will likely be due to a calendar shift from an earlier Easter, according to a SpendingPulse report released on Tuesday. 

 Retailers are due to report monthly sales data later this week, and analysts are expecting better numbers than March, a largely dismal month where consumers cut back on shopping amid the weak economy, cold weather, high gasoline prices and recessionary fears. But improved April results will largely be driven by a calendar issue, rather than organic growth. This year, Easter was in March, rather than April, including the week after Easter with historically soft sales that tend to depress results. "There might be some positive numbers that get reported for the month of April, but don't get too carried away or too down on one particular data point," said Michael McNamara, vice president of Mastercard Spending Pulse. "Overall, it looks like a continuation of the very, very slow to weak growth levels we've been seeing." Spending Pulse is the retail data service of MasterCard Advisors, an arm of MasterCard Worldwide ( MA.N ). Specialty apparel sales rose 5.5 percent in April while women's apparel fell 0.2 percent. Men's apparel rose 6.4 percent and footwear rose 7.0 percent, McNamara said. But looking at three-month moving averages, the picture is bleaker with specialty apparel rising 0.8 percent, women's apparel falling 2.9 percent and men's apparel and footwear rising 4.1 percent 0.7 percent, respectively. Consumers continued to cut back on furniture spending during the month. Sales in that category, which has been hit especially hard by the housing slump, fell 4.5 percent in April. Spending on hotels also fell by half a percent during the month, McNamara said, a product of higher gasoline prices that have crimped travel and a corollary of lower airline ticket sales. But some consumers, namely foreign tourists lured by the benefit of a weak U.S. dollar, are still spending. "There are some pockets of strength in luxury spending categories, but a lot of that it appears to us is due to tourism," said McNamara, citing spending at upscale apparel shops and department stores. "If you're concentrated in a tourist destination like New York City, you might be doing a bit better." The SpendingPulse data is derived from the aggregate sales in the MasterCard U.S. payment network, coupled with estimates on all other payments including cash and check.
