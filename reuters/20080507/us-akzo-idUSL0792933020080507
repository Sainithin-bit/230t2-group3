 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - Dutch chemical group Akzo Nobel reported a less-than-expected 2 percent drop in first-quarter core profit on Wednesday, but warned U.S. market conditions in decorative paints remained soft, hitting its shares. 

 Akzo said the year began well but adverse weather conditions in Europe and eastern Canada at the end of the quarter resulted in a delay in market demand. "In the United States, the trading environment continued to be soft," the world's biggest paint company said in a statement. U.S. paint makers such as PPG Industries ( PPG.N ) and Sherwin-Williams ( SHW.N ) have also been hit by the sagging U.S. housing market and weakening global economy. "It should be clear by now that the U.S. market will continue to decline in 2008," Petercam analyst Jan van den Bossche said, adding he expected market conditions in continental Europe to worsen too. Akzo Nobel ( AKZO.AS ) shares were down 1.1 percent to 52.38 euros by 5:11 a.m. EDT (0911 GMT) after earlier dipping to 51.54 euros, underperforming a 0.6 percent higher DJ Stoxx European chemical index .SX4P. Akzo said its decorative paints unit, which sells brands such as Dulux, Sikkens and Flexa, performed well in Asia and Latin America, with double-digit growth in sales excluding currency affects and acquisitions. "From the first-quarter reporting, it is clear strong growth from emerging markets is not enough to balance the decline in the large mature coatings markets," Van den Bossche said. First-quarter earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), excluding one-offs and fair-value adjustments for the ICI acquisition, were 285 million euros ($441.4 million), as it felt the impact of higher raw material prices and a weak U.S. dollar. Analysts surveyed by Reuters had on average forecast a bigger drop to 264 million euros, with estimates ranging from 198 million to 317 million. First-quarter revenue from continuing operations was 3.51 billion euros, against analyst expectations of 3.56 billion. PRETTY CONFIDENT Akzo Nobel said it remained confident of outgrowing its markets and at least maintaining results in line with 2007's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of 1.87 billion euros. "Based on what we have seen in the first quarter we remain pretty confident," Akzo's Chief Financial Officer Keith Nichols told reporters in a conference call, adding that the outlook was based on conservative assumptions. It is the first time the results include Britain's Imperial Chemical Industries Plc (ICI), which Akzo bought for 8 billion pounds ($15.7 billion) in January, and the first time the Dutch firm gives separate numbers for decorative paints, the core of  ICI. Nichols said the integration of ICI was well on track and that he expected to improve margins further this year within the decorative paints unit, which accounted for about one third of total sales and EBITDA in the quarter. EBITDA at Akzo's decorative paints unit rose 3 percent to 102 million euros during the first quarter, with EBITDA margins up 8.8 percent from last year's 8.1 percent as a result of changes in product mix and a cost control. Akzo shares have dropped 8 percent since the paint maker said last month it was feeling the economic slowdown. Akzo shares trade at eight times expected 2008 operating profit, according to Reuters data, compared with ratios of five and six for Sherwin-Williams and PPG Industries respectively.
