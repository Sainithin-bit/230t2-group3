 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson 
said U.S. financial markets are emerging from the credit crunch 
that many economists believe has pushed the country to the 
brink of recession, according to The Wall Street Journal. 

  "I do believe that the worst is likely to be behind us," 
Paulson told the newspaper in an interview.  The Journal said Paulson's comments appear to be the Bush 
administration's most optimistic assessment yet about the 
financial turmoil that began last year with defaults on 
subprime home loans and spread through financial institutions 
that owned tens of billions of dollars in mortgage-backed 
securities.  In the interview, however, the Treasury Secretary predicted 
there would be further "bumps along the road," and that it 
would take "some months longer" for the market distress to 
fully dissipate. Some financial markets, he said, still aren't 
fully functioning.  The Journal said Paulson pointed to the Federal Reserve's 
decision to help prevent the collapse of Bear Stearns BSC.N 
and to provide liquidity to other investment banks as "an 
inflection point" in the crisis.  The newspaper said Paulson also believes Congress will soon 
pass two measures he considers critical: one to improve the 
regulation of Fannie Mae FNM.N and Freddie Mac FRE.N, the 
government-chartered mortgage companies, and another to 
overhaul the Federal Housing Administration.  (Reporting by  Mark McSherry ; Editing by  Braden Reddall )
