 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Soft data on economic growth underscores the need to both resolve the fight over raising the nation's debt limit and put in place measures to spur activity, a top White House adviser said on Friday. 

 "We are at a fragile moment in the world economy and cannot afford to do anything to undermine our recovery at a moment such as this," Austan Goolsbee, the head of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said in a statement. (Reporting by  Tim Ahmann ; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
