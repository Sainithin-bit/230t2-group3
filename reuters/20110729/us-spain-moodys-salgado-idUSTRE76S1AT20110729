 MADRID  (Reuters) - Spain's economy minister said on Friday that credit rating agency Moody's placing Spain on watch for a downgrade was not good news, but said there were a lot of positive elements within the report. Elena Salgado told national radio that an uptick in second quarter employment figures did include some seasonal effects from the service industry ahead of the peak tourist season, but nevertheless showed the start of an improved trend.
