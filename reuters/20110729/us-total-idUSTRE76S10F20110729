 PARIS/MILAN  (Reuters) - French and Italian oil majors Total SA ( TOTF.PA ) and Eni SpA ( ENI.MI ) reported lower second-quarter profits on Friday, reflecting dollar weakness and production outages partly due to fighting in Libya which shut most fields. 

 Total said second-quarter net income, excluding one-offs and non-cash gains due to changes in the value of fuel inventories, fell 6 percent from the same period last year to 2.79 billion euros ($4 billion), just below the 2.85 billion average forecast in a Reuters poll of analysts. Eni's underlying net profit fell 14 percent to 1.44 billion euros compared with an average forecast of 1.65 billion, as Libyan outages pushed its production down 12 percent to 1.49 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd). A 13 percent dip in the dollar hit both companies as the price of crude they produce is denominated in the U.S. currency. In dollar terms, Eni's net income fell 2 percent and Total's underlying result was up 7 percent, performances that paled in comparison to those of bigger rivals Royal Dutch Shell ( RDSa.L ) and Exxon Mobil ( XOM.N ), which posted profit rises of 56 percent and 41 percent respectively. Even at Norway's Statoil, the rise was 39 percent. Total shares traded down 1.8 percent at 37.65 euros by 1435 GMT in Paris, wiping more than 1.5 billion euros off its market value, while Eni shed 1.4 percent to 15.16 euros in Milan. The European oil and gas sector .SXEP fell 1.2 percent. RARE "The earnings miss against the consensus ... was notable because it is so rare at Total, which is so consistent," UBS analyst Jon Rigby said in a note, while CA Cheuvreux analyst Jean-Charles Lacoste called Eni's update disappointing. Total lost around 2 percent of oil and gas output, despite the acquisition of a 12 percent stake in Russian gas company Novatek NOTK.MM, as the Libyan conflict and maintenance downtime in North Sea fields pushed overall production to 2.31 million boepd. While production was likely to be flat in 2011 from 2010, Patrick de la Chevardiere told an analyst conference call that 2012 looked more promising. "The outlook for production growth is strong and 2012 is expected to be a very good year," he said. Total investment stood at $5 billion in the second quarter, in line with Total's $20 billion budget for 2011, de La Chevardiere added. This highlighted the difficulty for Western oil companies to match natural field decline with new finds. Total has spent billions of euros in recent months to build its presence in energy-rich countries such as Russia, Canada, Brazil or Australia, but has yet to fully benefit from this. The start-up of the 220,000-barrel per day Pazflor field offshore Angola should contribute "substantially" to near-term output growth, while major gas projects in Australia and Russia will bolster production at a later stage, the French group said. It targets 2 percent average annual output rise in 2010/15. Eni predicted a 10 percent drop in hydrocarbon production from 1.82 million boepd in 2010, stemming from the near-shutdown of operations in Libya, where it is the main foreign operator. Eni said it could quickly restart output at its Libyan fields when fighting ended, as no damage had been reported to its facilities, echoing comments on Thursday from Spanish rival Repsol ( REP.MC ). Total, Europe's largest refiner by capacity, also reported lower profits from its refining division due to weak crude processing margins. The so-called downstream business saw adjusted net operating income fall 59 percent year on year. Total shut the Gonfreville refinery in France and sold its stake in Cepsa CEP.MC this year as part of a move away from the low-margin European refining sector. It has also been in talks for at least 18 months to sell its Lindsey refinery in Britain. (Additional reporting by Muriel Boselli; Writing by  Tom Bergin ; Editing by  David Holmes  and David Hulmes)
