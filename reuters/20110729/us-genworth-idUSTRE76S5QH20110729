 (Reuters) - Mortgage insurer Genworth Financial ( GNW.N ) is taking steps to possibly split up the company, said its Chief Executive Michael Fraizer on a post-earnings conference call, sending its shares up 6 percent on Friday afternoon. 

 Fraizer said it would make sense splitting the company into two, but added that its not a "strategy to execute in the near term." To enable a possible split, Fraizer said they were thinking of realigning some of their businesses, bringing down debt and "transitioning certain business platforms toward more stand-alone capital structures." Genworth shares were trading up 5 percent at $8.23 on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by Rachel Chitra & Brenton Cordeiro in Bangalore; Editing by Roshni Menon)
