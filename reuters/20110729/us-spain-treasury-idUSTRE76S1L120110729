 MADRID  (Reuters) - The decision by ratings agency Moody's to put Spain's Aa1 rating on revision for a possible downgrade on Friday is based on short-term market developments, the Treasury said in a letter to investors seen by Reuters. 

 "It is the opinion of the Spanish government that the external arguments supporting this revision rely excessively on short-term market developments," the Treasury said. The letter also said Moody's fears surrounding higher funding costs were misplaced and said it would use the revision period to reiterate its unconditional commitment to fiscal discipline. Spain has a constitutional ban on bailing out regions which was conducive to fiscal discipline, the letter said, and added that an overhaul of the banking system and transparency tests had improved confidence.
