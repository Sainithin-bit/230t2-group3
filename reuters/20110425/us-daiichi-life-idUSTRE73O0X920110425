 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Dai-ichi Life Insurance ( 8750.T ) will book a 100 billion yen ($1.2 billion) special loss for the business year ended March 31 after its stake in Tokyo Electric Power ( 9501.T ) plummeted in value, a source told Reuters. 

 Dai-ichi Life, the utility's biggest shareholder with a 4 percent stake, has seen the value of its holding slump by four fifths as TEPCO struggles to bring its stricken Fukushima nuclear plant under control. (Reporting by Noriyuki Hirata; Writing by Tim Kelly; Editing by  Edwina Gibbs )
