 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Europe is set to ramp up economic surveillance to prevent a repeat of the region's recent debt crisis, European Central Bank Executive Board member Juergen Stark said on Monday. 

 Writing in a column in the Financial Times Stark rebuffed the idea that inaction had cost Europe dear during the recent problems. "The idea of Euro-paralysis is another illusion," Stark said. He backed new measures being drawn up by a task force under the control of European Union President Herman Van Rompuy, to fix current policy problem areas. "A new framework for macroeconomic surveillance will monitor whether national trends are compatible with those that are appropriate for the Union as a whole. "This framework will allow both targeted peer pressure and differentiated and more binding recommendations on follow-up action at the national level," Stark said.
