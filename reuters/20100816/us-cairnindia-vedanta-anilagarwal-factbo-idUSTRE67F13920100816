 (Reuters) - India-focused Vedanta Resources ( VED.L ) is set to buy a 51 percent stake in Cairn Energy's ( CNE.L ) Indian unit, Cairn India ( CAIL.BO ), for between $8 billion and $8.5 billion, a source familiar with the matter said on Friday. 

 The following are some key facts about Anil Agarwal, who controls Vedanta Resources: * Agarwal was ranked number 113 by Forbes in its list of the world's billionaires. The magazine estimates he is worth $6.4 billion. * Raised in Patna, in the eastern Indian state of Bihar, Agarwal reportedly quit school at the age of 15. He is now based in London, from where he runs a mining and metals empire that spans the UK, India, Australia and Zambia. * Agarwal started his business in Mumbai in 1976 as a scrap-metal dealer, and now controls UK-listed Vedanta Resources, whose interests include non-ferrous metals producer Sterlite Industries STRL.BO and India's largest iron ore exporter, Sesa Goa ( SESA.BO ). * Agarwal has faced criticism from activists who oppose Vedanta's plan to extract bauxite from what tribes-people say is a sacred mountain in India's impoverished but mineral-rich state of Orissa. Vedanta says the mine in the Niyamgiri mountain forests, beneath which lie 78 million tonnes of bauxite, will not violate the rights of local tribes. The company is also funding schools, clinics and is engaged in income-generation projects in the area. * A vegetarian, Agarwal counts prominent politicians among his close friends. He enjoys cycling, and is a devotee of the Hindu god Krishna. (Reporting by  Pratish Narayanan  in Mumbai; Editing by  Surojit Gupta  and Simon Jessop)
