 (Reuters) - India-focused Vedanta Resources ( VED.L ) is set to buy a 51 percent stake in Cairn Energy's ( CNE.L ) Indian unit, Cairn India ( CAIL.BO ), for between $8 billion and $8.5 billion, a source familiar with the matter said on Friday. 

 Here are some facts about Cairn India: * UK's Cairn Energy owns a 62.4 percent stake in Cairn India. Malaysia's national oil company Petronas PETR.UL holds 14.9 percent, while institutions own 20.2 percent. Individuals own the rest. * Cairn India is the country's fourth-largest oil and gas company valued at $13.8 billion as per Thursday's close. The shares hit a record high on Friday. * The firm raised $1.2 billion in an initial public offering in late 2006, and listed in Mumbai in January 2007. The IPO valued the company at $6.3 billion. * The firm hired Chief Executive Rahul Dhir in 2006 from Merrill Lynch, one of the managers of the firm's IPO. Dhir held a senior position in Merrill's energy investment banking unit. * In August 2009, Cairn India began pumping crude from its block in the Mangala oil field in the western Indian state of Rajasthan, the first major crude oil discovery in the energy-hungry nation in two decades. * The firm holds a 70 percent stake in the Rajasthan oil block, called RJ-ON-90/1, while Indian state-run explorer Oil & Natural Gas Corp ( ONGC.BO ) holds the balance. * Cairn India is developing three oil fields -- Mangala, Bhagyam and Aishwariya -- in the desert state of Rajasthan. * Production at the Mangala field is ramping up to the target plateau rate of 125,000 bopd. Bhagyam has the potential to produce 40,000 bopd and Aishwariya another 10,000 bopd. * Cairn India competes with ONGC and Oil India ( OILI.BO ) and to some extent with Reliance Industries ( RELI.BO ) * Apart from other assets in India, Cairn India also owns a block in Sri Lanka.
