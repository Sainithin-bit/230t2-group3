 LONDON  (Reuters) - Vedanta Resources plans to spend up to $9.6 billion clinching control of Cairn India, giving billionaire mining magnate Anil Agarwal a slice of India's oil reserves and exposure to surging demand. 

 Britain's Cairn Energy said on Monday it would sell most of its controlling stake, delivering billions of dollars to shareholders, while Agarwal's Vedanta will join BHP Billiton as the only miner with large oil interests. India-focused Vedanta will buy between 40 and 51 percent of Cairn India from Cairn Energy, holder of a 62.4 percent stake, and will offer to buy up to 20 percent from other shareholders to give it a stake of between 51 and 60 percent. Vedanta said Cairn India, the country's No.4 oil and gas company, has the potential to almost double current production to about 240,000 barrels of oil per day -- around a quarter of India's output -- allowing it to benefit from rising demand amid industrialization, economic growth, and an expanding population. The miner expects Cairn India to produce around 200,000 bopd by early 2012. India's government expects the economy to grow 8.5 percent this fiscal year, while the country's population is expected to overtake China in the next couple of decades. "The proposed acquisition significantly enhances Vedanta's position as a natural resources champion in India," said Agarwal, chairman of Vedanta and the group's biggest shareholder with a 61.2 percent holding. Vedanta is under pressure over its expansion plans, however. It has been forced to defend its human rights record over plans to build a bauxite mine in India's Orissa state and an Indian government panel said on Monday that it should not be given permission to mine there. Shares in Vedanta, which fell 20 percent last week when news of a Cairn deal broke and raised concerns about funding, were up 4.6 percent at 1103 GMT. Cairn Energy shares were up 3.3 percent and at a record high while Cairn India was 6.4 percent lower. Vedanta has more than quadrupled in value since early 2009, helped by recovering metal demand and making London resident Agarwal Britain's 10th richest person behind Indian-born steel baron Lakshmi Mittal who tops The Sunday Times Rich List. CHASING BHP Vedanta will hold 31-40 percent of Cairn India directly and Vedanta-controlled Sesa Goa Ltd, India's largest iron ore exporter, will hold 20 percent. The open offer will be financed via existing cash while the remainder will be funded by debt facilities of up to $6.5 billion. Vedanta said it already has committed lines of credit from banks over the next few years. Vedanta, which listed in London in 2003, has net debt of around $11 billion. It expects net debt to be less than two times EBITDA by March 2011 even as it plans to spend almost $10 billion on its operations in the next three years. A sale price of $8.66 per Cairn India share represents a 32 percent premium to the average price over the last 90 days and will leave Cairn Energy with a cash pile of up to $8.5 billion and a retained stake of at least 10.6 percent. That compares with the roughly $3 billion Cairn Energy Chairman Bill Gammell said it had invested in Cairn India. "With this deal, Vedanta is looking to become a company with the scale of something like BHP Billiton," said Alex Mathews of Geojit BNP-Paribas Financial Services in India. "It shows the company wants to be become a major resources player." Vedanta acquired the zinc assets of Anglo American in May, making it the world's largest integrated zinc and lead producer. Cairn India's main asset, with an estimated 6.5 billion barrels of oil and gas, is in Rajasthan near Vedanta's zinc operations. "Oil production allows Vedanta to diversify their production base and provides a hedge against operating cost increases, of which energy prices is a key input," analysts at Collins Stewart wrote. Cairn Energy will return most of the sale proceeds to shareholders and spend much of the rest on exploration in Greenland. Analysts see it as the company's next big prospect and expect an update on two key wells next week. Standard Chartered was Vedanta's lead financing bank and joint lead financial adviser, alongside JPMorgan Cazenove and Morgan Stanley. Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs also provided funding and advice. NM Rothschild advised Cairn.
