 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Dell Inc DELL.O said on Thursday several of its former employees had been told they may face some sort of action by financial regulators related to a long-running probe of the PC maker's accounting. 

 The former Dell employees had received Wells Notices that indicate Securities and Exchange Commission staff had made a preliminary decision to recommend the SEC begin a civil or administrative action against them, Dell said in a regulatory filing late on Thursday. Dell said the notices were related to a previously reported SEC inquiry, started in August 2005, into the accounting and financial reporting of the world's third-largest seller of personal computers for periods beginning in 2001. "It is possible that other individuals have received or will receive such notices," Dell said in the statement. Dell shares, which had closed 0.2 percent higher at $15.05, were not active in late afternoon trading on Nasdaq, when the Wells Notices were reported by the company.
