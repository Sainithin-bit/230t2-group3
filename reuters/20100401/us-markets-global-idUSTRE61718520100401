 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The dollar hit a seven-month high against the yen and global stocks rose on Thursday as data showing strong manufacturing growth in Asia, Europe and the Americas raised optimism about the economic recovery. 

 Oil rose to an 18-month high as the economic data encouraged funds to step up buying on the first day of the second quarter, and higher commodity prices helped drive up energy and materials shares on both sides of the Atlantic. European shares finished at an 18-month closing high. But on Wall Street the Nasdaq gave back most of its gains as shares of BlackBerry maker Research in Motion RIM.TORIMM.O tumbled on disappointing quarterly results. Data on Thursday showed factories across China, Europe, the United States and Brazil cranked up production. An index of U.S. manufacturing activity rose to its highest level in more than 5-1/2 years, the Institute for Supply Management said. Commodities and emerging market assets jumped, while prices of safe-haven U.S. Treasury bonds retreated as investors started the second quarter with renewed appetite for higher-yielding assets. Data showing new U.S. jobless claims fell more than expected last week also improved sentiment as investors saw more signs that the strong economic recovery in emerging markets is also taking root in the industrialized countries. "We had a slew of nice upside surprises from manufacturing data in China, Europe, the UK. So that's a good start to the month," said Matthew Strauss, senior strategist at RBC Capital Markets in Toronto. "And if we get a good payrolls number tomorrow, that's a dollar-positive," he added. Both the Dow and the S&P 500 finished Thursday's session at 18-month highs. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  ended up 70.44 points, or 0.65 percent, at 10,927.07, while the Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  gained 8.67 points, or 0.74 percent, to 1,178.10. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  rose 4.62 points, or 0.19 percent, to 2,402.58. RIM's shares slid 7.42 percent as the company's quarterly results increased worries about rivals stealing market share from the BlackBerry smartphone. Anxiety over Friday's key U.S. payrolls data also took part of the shine off the U.S. stock market. Economists expect the report to show 190,000 new jobs were added to the economy in March. The data will be released while U.S. markets are closed on Good Friday for the long Easter holiday weekend. "The fact that they are releasing the jobs report on the day when 90 percent of the markets are not going to open gives a negative outlook," said Frank Pavilonis, senior market strategist at  Lind-Waldock, a retail brokerage firm in Chicago. Still, energy and materials shares led the S&P 500's gains as the industrial production data suggested improving global demand for commodities. The S&P energy index .GSPE rose 1.6 percent. The S&P materials index .GSPM advanced 1.8 percent. In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top shares  .FTEU3  rose 1.43 percent to 1,094.05, its highest close since late September 2008. Investors snapped up miners' shares as copper hit a 20-month high on signals of improving demand. BHP Billiton ( BLT.L ) added 1.8 percent, while Anglo American ( AAL.L ) rose 2.5 percent; Rio Tinto ( RIO.L ) gained 2.6 percent and ENRC ( ENRC.L ) advanced 2.8 percent. Antofagasta ( ANTO.L ) advanced 3.4 percent and Xstrata XTA.L climbed 4.1 percent. In Asia, Tokyo's Nikkei average  .N225  rose 1.4 percent to end at 11,244.40, its highest level in a year and a half, buoyed by the yen's drop, which makes it easier for Japanese exporters to sell their goods abroad. The MSCI All-Country World Index .MIWD00000PUS of global stocks was up 1 percent, after posting a fourth consecutive quarterly gain with a 2.7 percent rise in the first three months of 2010. The MSCI stock index for emerging markets .MSCIEF climbed 1.68 percent as HSBC's China Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) showed first-quarter manufacturing output expanded at the briskest clip in the survey's six-year history. China's official purchasing managers index rose to 55.1 in March from 52.0 in February, beating the median forecast of 54.5 in a Reuters poll of economists. In Brazil, industrial production climbed 1.5 percent in February, well above the 0.9 percent forecast by economists in a Reuters poll. Manufacturing activity in the euro zone also grew last month at its fastest pace in over three years, data showed. YEN FALLS, OIL JUMPS The U.S. dollar rose as high as 93.89 yen, its best level since August 2009. It was last at 93.82 yen, up 0.39 percent on the day. The yen's weakening was also spurred by talk that Japanese investors will look for higher returns abroad now that the country's new fiscal year has started. The euro, however, erased early losses and gained 0.56 percent against the dollar to $1.3585. Against the Swiss franc, the euro also jumped to a session high of 1.441 as traders mentioned talk of intervention by the Swiss National Bank to prop up its currency. The SNB declined to comment on the franc's price action. The flow of money into riskier assets put government bonds under pressure. The price of the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note slipped 10/32, with the yield rising to 3.87 percent from 3.83 percent on Wednesday. The Chinese data also helped lift metals prices, with copper rising to a 20-month high as improving demand sentiment combined with fund buying to drive the rally, while nickel hit a near two-year high at $25,320. Oil pushed to a near 18-month high, bolstered by talk of fresh inflows from investors at the start of the new quarter. U.S. crude for May delivery rose $1.11, or 1.3 percent, to settle at $84.87 a barrel, its highest close since October 9, 2008. Its session high at $85.22 was also its highest level since that day.
