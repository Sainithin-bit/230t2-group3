 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. manufacturing sector expanded in March at its fastest pace in more than five years, marking the eighth straight month of growth, according to an industry report released on Thursday. 

 CONSTRUCTION SPENDING: U.S. construction spending fell for a fourth straight month in February to the slowest rate in nearly 7-1/2 years as activity softened in every major sector from homebuilding to public construction projects. KEY POINTS: * The Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity rose to 59.6 from 56.5 in February. * That was the highest reading since July 2004. The median forecast of 79 economists surveyed by Reuters was for a reading of 57.0. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector. * The index's employment index slipped slightly to 55.1 in March from 56.1 the prior month, but prices paid jumped to 75.0 from 67.0 in February. * Overall construction spending fell 1.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $846.23 billion following a revised 1.4 percent decline in January that previously was reported as a 0.6 percent decrease, the U.S. Commerce Department said on Thursday. * The February drop exceeded the 1 percent decline that economists surveyed by Reuters had forecast. COMMENTS: NORBERT ORE, CHAIR OF THE ISM MANUFACTURING BUSINESS SURVEY COMMITTEE SURVEY: "This is the eighth consecutive month of growth in manufacturing. With a reading that high you'd have to assume that manufacturing would continue on a path of growth. Seventeen out of 18 industries reported growth. It looks like we're finishing the first quarter with strength. Very very strong readings, indicating continued recovery in manufacturing. Manufacturers indicate they are willing to hire if they need additional people. Exports are strong. Imports are strong. Overall it's a good finish to the first quarter. March is just an outstanding month. Looking at it just through the eyes of manufacturing, the numbers for first quarter, January through March, would correspond to a 5.4 percent increase in Q1 real GDP." FRED DICKSON, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, D.A. DAVIDSON & CO., LAKE OSWEGO, OREGON: "ISM was stronger than expected, and construction was less than expected. The manufacturing side of the economy continues to expand, and the numbers were good. I think investors should be pleased with the trend on the manufacturing side, and we should see a little bit of a pickup on the services side next week." RYAN DETRICK, SENIOR TECHNICAL ANALYST, SCHAEFFER'S INVESTMENT RESEARCH, CINCINNATI, OHIO: "China got things started with their manufacturing data and now you've got our own manufacturing data. It's more of the same. This economy in our view is bouncing back much stronger than most people expect. Expectations seem to continually be a little low especially on the manufacturing front." TONY CRESCENZI, MARKET STRATEGIST AND PORTFOLIO MANAGER, PACIFIC INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT CO. (PIMCO), NEWPORT BEACH, CALIFORNIA: "The most important component possibly was the inventory component which rose to the highest level since July 1984. It shows the inventory cycle is at a second phase. In the first phase in 2009, companies slowed the rate of liquidation. In the second phase they accumulate inventories and this requires further increases in production. "Companies are already squeezing as much out of their existing payrolls as they can. The proof is, the productivity numbers for the past three quarters are the best for any three quarters since 1958. Now they will have to consider increasing payrolls. This shows companies have gained some confidence because final demand has picked up." BRUCE BITTLES, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, ROBERT W. BAIRD & CO, NASHVILLE: "ISM was about in line with expectations, maybe a little stronger in the headline number. The manufacturing sector has been the bright spot in the economy for the past six to eight months, and it continues to improve, not surprisingly. However, its only about only 10 percent of the economy. So it's pulling us up, but it's a small horse pulling a big economy. "The ISM will probably be the big driver today, but markets might be somewhat quiet ahead of tomorrow's job number. Some hesitancy." MARY ANN HURLEY, VICE PRESIDENT OF FIXED INCOME TRADING, D.A. DAVIDSON & CO, SEATTLE: "ISM certainly printed at a higher level than expected, and that is putting a little bit of downward pressure on (Treasuries) prices. We were down prior to the number coming out on jobless claims continuing to fall and on concern over tomorrow's employment number, and the ISM number just extended the declines." PIERRE ELLIS, SENIOR ECONOMIST, DECISION ECONOMICS, NEW YORK: "This is unmitigated good news for the manufacturing sector which is good news for the progress of the general recovery. The ISM index was a positive indication on manufacturing, assuring markets that progress continues and maybe is even accelerates in manufacturing. The message of strength was confirmed by the rise in new orders. There's particular strength in export orders. "Construction was weak. Construction of residential housing is still adjusting downward. Business construction continues to be very poor as it will be for a while." TODD SCHOENBERGER, MANAGING DIRECTOR, LANDCOLT TRADING, SAN ANTONIO: "Obviously, it's perceived as a good sign for the economy. You do have a recovery here but it's a benign one. You are seeing more demand from overseas for U.S. products. "That's why we are seeing the stocks doing well here. "For bonds, it's inevitable later we are going to see higher rates later this year, but they won't shoot up. Don't be surprised if there will be a bid for bonds after tomorrow's payroll number." DAN COOK, SENIOR MARKET ANALYST, IG MARKETS, CHICAGO: "Definitely a great number, better than expected and I expect some dollar strength particularly against the euro and the pound. The one negative was the small drop in employment. Not something you want to see in a week focused on employment." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stock indexes rose BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices fell to session lows DOLLAR: U.S. dollar rose against the euro.
