 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - American Airlines said on Thursday it will beef up service to and from New York area airports, a move that puts new pressure on JetBlue Airways ( JBLU.O ) as it strives to regain customer confidence after last week's operational meltdown. 


 The expansion by American, the world's largest airline and a unit of AMR Corp AMR.N, also increases competition with Delta Air Lines DALRQ.PK and Continental Airlines CAL.N. American plans to complete a $1.1 billion terminal this summer at John F. Kennedy International Airport where JetBlue is the largest carrier and is upgrading its own facilities. American said it would add new and additional service between Las Vegas, San Francisco, Atlanta and other cities. JetBlue operates 173 daily flights from JFK and flies four daily nonstop flights from there to Las Vegas and plans to launch New York-San Francisco service in May. "New York City is our hometown and we made JFK a popular airport for North American service," said JetBlue spokeswoman Alison Eshelman. "It's a tough market. We welcome the competition. It will make the market better for consumers." American's expansion reflects the importance carriers place on dominance in New York, the nation's busiest market. Continental, which flies to 77 international destinations from its hub at nearby Newark Liberty International Airport, is the largest carrier in New York area. Over the past 12 months, Continental flew an average of 45,985 seats per day out of the three main New York airports. American averaged 29,122 seats, while Delta flew an average of 28,551 seats, according to figures provided by Continental. In January, Continental said air fares in the New York area would come under pressure as it defends its Newark hub from competition from JetBlue and others. JetBlue has said it will pay out about $26 million in refunds and travel vouchers after it stranded hundreds of passengers aboard grounded aircraft and canceled some 1,200 flights after last week's ice storm. American also stranded passengers on planes for hours in December when storms in Dallas diverted some flights to Austin. Shares of AMR were down 78 cents, or 2 percent, to $37.75 in afternoon trade on the New York stock exchange. JetBlue shares were down 18 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $13.01 on Nasdaq.
