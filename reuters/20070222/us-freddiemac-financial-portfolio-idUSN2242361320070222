 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Freddie Mac's FRE.N retained portfolio grew by an annualized 4.4 percent in January to $706.2 billion, the second largest U.S. home funding company said on Thursday. 


 In 2006, the company's retained portfolio contracted by an annualized 0.9 percent, with the retained portfolio ending the year at $703.6 billion. Freddie Mac's duration gap, an interest rate risk measure, stayed at zero months, unchanged from the previous month. A zero duration gap indicates that Freddie Mac's payments to its debtholders matches income the company receives on its assets.
