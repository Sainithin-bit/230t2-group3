 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - OfficeMax Inc. OMX.N, the nation's 
No. 3 office supplies retailer, reported a quarterly profit on 
Thursday, reversing a year-earlier loss, helped by an increase 
in its contract business. 


  The company, which sells office products through its 
namesake stores and over the Internet, said fourth-quarter net 
income was $58.0 million, or 76 cents a share, compared with a 
loss of $43.1 million, or 62 cents, a year earlier.
