 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - OfficeMax Inc. OMX.N, the nation's No. 3 office supply retailer, posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings on Thursday, reversing a year-earlier loss, as both its contract and retail businesses improved. 


 The company, which operates 911 stores, said fourth-quarter net income was $58 million, or 76 cents a share, compared with a loss of $43.1 million, or 62 cents, a year earlier. Excluding special items, earnings were $37.2 million, or 48 cents per share. Analysts, on average, had forecast 40 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. During the quarter, OfficeMax recognized a $38.8 million credit related to the sales of its paper, forest products and timberland assets, and $10.7 million in expenses as it closed a facility, paid severance and consolidated its headquarters. Operating income in the contract segment, which sells directly to business and government customers, jumped to $50.8 million from $29.6 million a year earlier. "The upside was driven by stronger-than-expected results in contract vs. our expectations," Credit Suisse analyst Gary Balter said in a research note. Gross margin in the contract segment rose to 22.5 percent from 21.7 percent, helped by better vendor income and lower delivery costs, OfficeMax said. Operating income in the retail segment increased to $42.3 million from $22.4 million. Gross margin rose to 29.1 percent from 25.8 percent, helped by improved promotional strategy and greater efficiency in the company's supply chain, Chairman and Chief Executive Sam Duncan said on a conference call. "There was a lot of low-hanging fruit and we were able to take advantage of that," Duncan said. He said OfficeMax would remodel at least 100 stores this year as it looks to compete more effectively against Staples Inc. ( SPLS.O ), the industry leader, and Office Depot Inc. ( ODP.N ), which reported higher profit but disappointing sales last week. OfficeMax opened 29 stores during the fourth quarter and closed two. It ended the year with 59 fewer stores than at year-end 2005. Duncan declined to say how much the remodeling efforts would impact future profit, and the company did not provide an earnings forecast for 2007. Shares of OfficeMax, which have soared about 94 percent since hitting a 52-week low of $27.91 a year ago, were up $1.20, or 2.25 percent, to $54.47 in midday trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock trades at 26.5 times estimated 2007 earnings, a premium to Staples and Office Depot, which trade at multiples of 21.4 and 15.5, respectively.
