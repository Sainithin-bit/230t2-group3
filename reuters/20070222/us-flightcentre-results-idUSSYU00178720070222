 MELBOURNE  (Reuters) - Australian travel retailer Flight Center Ltd. ( FLT.AX ) said on Thursday its first-half profit rose 10 percent, boosted by recent acquisitions despite disappointing sales growth. 


 Flight Center, which has agreed to a A$1.62 billion ($1.3 billion) buy-out offer, said net profit before one-off items rose to A$37.0 million from A$33.6 million. The company said the result was within the range outlined in its preliminary results in January. In October, company management and the investment firm Pacific Equity Partners offered A$17.20 per share for the company, an offer that analysts say is high for a company with limited growth prospects as more people book flights and holidays directly on the Internet. Flight Center is due to hold a shareholder meeting on February 28 to vote on the offer. Its shares were unchanged at A$16.90 on Thursday. (A$=$1.26)
