 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Stocks declined on Thursday as oil prices jumped above $61 a barrel, adding to worries about inflation stirred earlier in the week. 


 Iran's determination to enrich uranium in defiance of the United Nations also made stock investors nervous, traders said.  "There are two pieces of the puzzle that are troubling. One is housing, and the other is oil menacingly poking its head up," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer of Johnson Illington Advisors. "The good news of declining gas prices had offset the drag on confidence and spending that came from the slowdown in housing, but now we may not get that helping hand." The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was down 54.64 points, or 0.43 percent, at 12,683.77. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was down 2.29 points, or 0.16 percent, at 1,455.34. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was down 1.84 points, or 0.07 percent, at 2,516.58. U.S. crude for April delivery was up 99 cents at $61.06 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, after rising more than $1 to a NYMEX session high at $61.25. Government data released on Thursday showed a larger-than-expected drawdown in distillate supplies last week and a sharp drop in gasoline inventories that went against expectations. Home builders' shares fell after Toll Brothers Inc. ( TOL.N ) lowered its profit forecast and said it did not yet see a rebound going into the spring sales season. Toll Brothers slid 2.6 percent to $32.02 on the New York Stock Exchange. The Dow Jones Home Construction index .DJUSHB, which includes Toll Brothers, KB Home ( KBH.N ) and other home builders' stocks, was down 2.2 percent. Chip makers' shares helped stem the Nasdaq's decline after Analog Devices Inc. ADI.N, a manufacturer of signal processors, reported stronger-than-expected profit late on Wednesday, improving the earnings outlook for the semiconductor sector. Analog's rivals, such as National Semiconductor Corp. ( NSM.N ) , Texas Instruments Inc. TXN.N and Linear Technology Corp. ( LLTC.O ), were trading higher. Shares of Analog Devices shot up 10.2 percent to $36.72 on the NYSE. National Semiconductor rose 6.5 percent to $25.18 and Texas Instrument shares added 2.8 percent to $31.85, also on the Big Board. Linear Technology climbed 8.5 percent to $34.04 on the Nasdaq. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange semiconductor index .SOXX was up 2.1 percent, the biggest one-day percentage rise in more than three months. Also helping the Nasdaq were shares of Whole Foods Market Inc. WFMI.O. The organic grocer made a bid for smaller rival Wild Oats Markets Inc. OATS.O. Whole Foods shares shot up 13.6 percent to $51.89, while Wild Oats stock surged 17.3 percent to $18.44. Traders said Wednesday's news of a larger-than-expected increase in core consumer prices last month brought inflation concerns into sharper focus. Adding to jitters on the energy front, the International Atomic Energy Agency said that Iran had failed to meet a February 21 deadline to suspend uranium enrichment, possibly leading to new sanctions for Tehran. Iran is the world's fourth-largest oil exporter.
