 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - McDonald's Corp. ( MCD.N ) on Wednesday said Chief Executive Jim Skinner will receive a bonus of more than $8.8 million, mostly to reward him for the hamburger chain's sharp turnaround during the last three years. 


 In a regulatory filing, McDonald's said Skinner will get a $3.5 million bonus for 2006 and will also receive a $5.33 million payout under a three-year performance reward program. That is in addition to his regular salary. The $5.33 million covers the period from 2004 through 2006, McDonald's said, and was "based on the company's superior performance" during that period. McDonald's has been revitalized since implementing an aggressive turnaround strategy in 2003 that included adding higher-priced menu items such as chicken sandwiches, extending restaurant hours, and promoting its popular breakfast menu. Skinner became CEO at McDonald's in late 2004 after his predecessor, Charlie Bell, stepped down to focus on a battle with cancer that led to his death two months later. Bell, himself, had taken over as CEO earlier that year from Jim Cantalupo after he died suddenly of a heart attack.
