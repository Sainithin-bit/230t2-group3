 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. antitrust authorities said on Thursday they approved plans by German conglomerate Siemens AG ( SIEGn.DE ) to buy industrial design software maker UGS Corp. for $3.5 billion. 


 Officials completed their investigation of the deal without taking action, the Federal Trade Commission said in a notice. Plano, Texas-based UGS is owned by three private equity firms -- Bain Capital, Silver Lake Partners and Warburg Pincus, which bought UGS from technology services provider Electronic Data Systems in March 2004 for $2.05 billion.
