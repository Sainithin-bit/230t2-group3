 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Safeway Inc. ( SWY.N ), the No. 3 U.S. grocer, posted a 77 percent rise in quarterly profit on Thursday, helped by a tax benefit in the latest quarter and year-ago results that were hurt by store closures and employee buyouts. 


 Safeway, which has been remodeling stores and using fresh produce to attract shoppers, also said it still expects fiscal 2007 earnings of $1.90 to $2 per share. Analysts' average forecast is $1.95, according to Reuters Estimates. Shares of Safeway, which have risen 25 percent since it reported third-quarter earnings in October, fell as much as 6 percent before regaining some ground in afternoon trading. "Expectations had risen recently, and there may be some disappointment that 2007 guidance was not raised," wrote Goldman Sachs analyst John Heinbockel in a note to clients. PROFIT RISE Safeway, whose chains include Vons and Dominick's, said profit rose to $307.9 million, or 69 cents a share, in the fourth quarter ended December 30, from $173.5 million, or 39 cents a share, a year earlier. Net income in the latest quarter included tax benefits of 8 cents a share, while year-ago results included costs of 10 cents per share for store closures and employee buyouts. Analysts on average expected Safeway to earn 60 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. The earnings come a day after Whole Foods Market Inc. WFMI.O said it would buy smaller rival Wild Oats Markets Inc. OATS.O for $565 million to compete better with larger traditional grocers, which are increasingly encroaching on its organic and prepared foods niches. Pleasanton, California-based Safeway is now selling prepared foods like grilled panini sandwiches to attract those who dine out or shop at stores like Whole Foods. It has also introduced exclusive products such as Rancher's Reserve beef and Signature soups to attract consumers looking for quality foods. On a conference call, Steve Burd, Safeway's chairman, president and chief executive, said the company had been looking at acquisition opportunities, but was more interested in expanding its own business. "We're getting ourselves in a position where we can comfortably get back to acquisitions," he said, but any deal would probably still be two years away. RISING SALES Safeway's fourth-quarter sales rose almost 4 percent to $12.5 billion but fell short of analysts' average forecast of $12.64 billion. Identical-store sales, including and excluding fuel, increased 3.5 percent. Identical-store sales exclude new or replacement stores. To boost sales, Safeway is remodeling its stores to a "Lifestyle" format, which includes bakeries, a produce section reminiscent of an outdoor market and large flower shop areas. It had remodeled 43 percent of its store base by the end of the year, and Burd said the company will have a "pretty moderate program" of opening new stores until it gets closer to completing the remodeling projects. For 2007, Safeway said identical-store sales, excluding fuel, are expected to increase about 3.3 percent. With four weeks remaining in its current quarter, Burd said Safeway was "comfortably ahead" of the forecast for the year. Safeway shares were down $1.58, or 4.3 percent, to $35.38 in afternoon trading after going as low as $34.59 earlier on Thursday. (Additional reporting by Ankur Relia in Bangalore)
