 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - TRW Automotive Holdings Corp. ( TRW.N ) reported a 44 percent drop in quarterly earnings on Thursday under pressure from automaker production cuts in North America, but exceeded average Wall Street forecasts and shares rose as much as 2.2 percent to an all-time high. 


 TRW also warned that output cuts by automakers in North America, price reductions on its parts, commodity cost pressures and expectations for significantly lower heavy truck sales would pose challenges in 2007. Net earnings fell to $33 million, or 32 cents per share, in the fourth quarter from $59 million, or 57 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 4.3 percent to $3.27 billion Excluding a tax benefit, TRW earned 16 cents per share. Analysts, on average, had expected 3 cents per share on revenue of $3.15 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. TRW -- which makes safety products such as airbags, electronic stability controls and tire pressure monitoring equipment -- has been closing plants and shifting production to lower-cost regions in response to industry pressures. "Given the production environment, the company posted solid results for the quarter and full-year," Morningstar analyst John Novak said. "Safety-related spending should remain strong and we think TRW is well-positioned to benefit in the long run." J.P. Morgan analyst Himanshu Patel said in a note that TRW's safety component focus and relatively low valuation would make it attractive to long-term investors. While results have been pressured by auto production cuts in North America and a shift in demand toward cars from more profitable light trucks due to higher gasoline prices, TRW is considered to be stronger than many of its peers. Most U.S. auto-parts makers have been restructuring to cope with market share losses by General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ), Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) and DaimlerChrysler AG's DCX.N DCXGn.DE Chrysler Group in North America. TRW warned in September that production cuts in Ford's F-Series pickup trucks in North America would hurt 2006 results. TRW expects Big 3 production to be down about 4 percent in 2007, with a 9.5 percent drop in the first half. TRW forecast 2007 earnings per share of $1.85 to $2.15, while analysts on average expect $2.11. It forecast sales of $13.4 billion to $13.8 billion, while analysts expect $13.38 billion. It anticipates first-quarter sales of $3.5 billion, while analysts are looking for $3.43 billion. TRW shares were up 35 cents, or 1.17 percent, at $30.28 on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock's close at $29.93 Wednesday was its highest since TRW started trading publicly in February 2004. Through Wednesday, the shares had risen 15.7 percent this year, compared with a 12 percent rise in the Dow Jones U.S. automobiles and parts index .DJUSAP.
