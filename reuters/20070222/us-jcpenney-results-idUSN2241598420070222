 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Department store operator J.C. Penney Co. ( JCP.N ) reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday as private brands aided profit margins. 


 Earnings from continuing operations came to $457 million, or $2 a share for the fourth quarter that ended February 3, compared with $450 million, or $1.92 a share, a year earlier. Analysts on average, expected profit of $1.97 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. The latest quarter included an extra week. Net income, which includes discontinued operations, was $477 million for the most recent period, down 13 percent from $551 million a year earlier. Total sales gained 7 percent to nearly $6.7 billion for the quarter. J.C. Penney said total department store sales rose 4 percent on a 13-week basis, while sales at stores open at least a year rose 2.2 percent, helped by children's apparel, fine jewelry and family shoes. The chain said gross margin improved 180 basis points to 38 percent of sales, reflecting benefits from strong private brand performance and better inventory management. J.C. Penney, which has been working to convince shoppers that it has shed its dowdy image and become a stylish retailer stocked with fashionable merchandise, said it expects per-share profit of about 99 cents for the first quarter and $5.44 for the full year, as sales at stores open at least a year rise in the low-single digits for both periods. Analysts on average expect $1.04 a share for the first period and $5.43 a share for the year, according to Reuters Estimates.
