 LONDON  (Reuters) - Britain's EMI EMI.L has written to U.S. rival Warner Music WMG.N to outline what its reaction would be to a bid and highlighting its concerns over regulatory issues, a source familiar with the matter said on Thursday. 


 Warner approached EMI about a possible bid at the end of January despite uncertainty over whether it would win European regulatory approval. In the letter, EMI said it would consider any bid in terms of the price offered and whether it would be approved by European regulators. Analysts have noted that EMI appears to be reluctant to engage with Warner at the current price and a media report on Thursday said the group was also in talks with a number of private equity firms as potential alternatives. The company declined to comment on the report. Its shares were up 1.1 percent at 244 pence by 1200 GMT. The Financial Times said EMI had held talks with a number of private equity firms including One Equity Partners, a unit of JPMorgan Chase and Co. ( JPM.N ). But the newspaper quoted people familiar with the discussions as saying no firm offers appeared imminent because Warner Music and would-be private equity suitors wanted the right to conduct extensive due diligence on EMI's business. A spokeswoman for One could not be reached. Warner Music, the world's fourth-largest music company and home to Madonna and the Red Hot Chili Peppers, said on Tuesday it had approached EMI after securing the support of Impala, the trade group for independent music labels which has previously challenged consolidation in the industry. But any merger would still be heavily scrutinized by regulators. Warner could push ahead with the bid and accept responsibility for the regulatory risk as Vivendi's Universal Music ( VIV.PA ) did when it agreed to buy Bertelsmann's BMG Music Publishing last year. That deal is still being examined by the European Commission, as is the 2004 merger between Sony Corp's ( 6758.T ) Sony Music and Bertelsmann's BERT.UL BMG. EMI, the world's third-largest music company and home to Robbie Williams and Coldplay, issued its second profit warning in as many months last week. Analysts believe any bid for EMI is likely to now be pitched at around 260p although UBS analysts said in a note to clients they thought Warner could pay as little as 245 pence. Warner offered 320 pence a share for EMI last year. Bridgewell analyst Patrick Yau said EMI appeared reluctant to entertain a bid from Warner at this level. Analysts at ABN AMRO said any private equity bid was likely to be lower, at around 235 pence per share due to fewer synergies and already high levels of gearing in the recorded music business. However the analyst said if "EMI (or private equity) were willing to split the group up, this rises to 260 pence, and compares favorably to our estimated bid value from Warner (c260 pence), without the associated regulatory risks." Separately, the Times newspaper said Warner Music had secured private agreements from Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers to fund a 2-billion-pound-plus ($3.90 billion) cash bid for its British rival.
