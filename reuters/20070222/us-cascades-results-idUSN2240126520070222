 TORONTO  (Reuters) - Packaging products and paper company Cascades Inc. ( CAS.TO ) reported a smaller fourth-quarter loss on Thursday, helped by an 8 percent jump in sales. 


 Cascades said it had a loss of C$46 million ($40 million), or 56 Canadian cents a share, during the three-month period ended December 31, compared with a loss of C$104 million, or C$1.28 a share, in the year-before period. Revenue during the quarter rose to C$876 million from C$810 million, helped by business acquisitions, better selling prices and shipments. Looking ahead, Cascades said it remains cautious on its expectations heading into the second quarter given the volatility of energy prices and higher fiber prices. Cascades also said it will remain "opportunistic" in regard to potential value-added acquisitions in its core segments of packaging and tissue. ($1=$1.16 Canadian)
