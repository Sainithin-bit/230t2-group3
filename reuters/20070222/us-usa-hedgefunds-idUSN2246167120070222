 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Market discipline and risk awareness will best protect investors and the economy from any problem in the hedge-fund industry, top U.S. regulators said on Thursday, backing the current light regulatory approach. 


 The Treasury Department-led President's Working Group on Financial Markets released the findings, which are aimed at guiding U.S. financial regulators as they deal with the huge pools of private capital. The principles state that investor protection concerns "can be addressed most effectively through a combination of market discipline and regulatory policies that limit direct investment in such pools to more sophisticated investors." The principles note that because hedge funds can involve complex, illiquid or opaque investments and investment strategies, they are most appropriate for investors "with the sophistication to identify, analyze and bear these risks." The group's principles, however, put the onus on limiting risks to pension funds to pension fund managers. Pension fund managers "have a duty under applicable law to act in the best interest of the beneficiaries. They have an ongoing responsibility to perform due diligence to ensure that their investment decisions are prudent and conform to sound par beneficiaries," the principles said. The principles also suggested that creditors and counterparties should take an active role in ensuring loans to hedge funds do not exceed their credit standards and risk profiles. "Where sufficient information is not forthcoming from a particular private pool, creditors and counterparties should tighten margin, collateral and other credit terms," the report said. As hedge funds have grown -- there are nearly 9,000 now with an estimated $1.5 trillion in total assets -- they have expanded from their initial client base of the rich and institutions to take money from the less well-to-do, raising worldwide government concerns about risk and suitability. Key German officials called for deeper scrutiny of hedge funds ahead of this month's Group of Seven finance ministers meeting in Essen, Germany, citing a lack of transparency for the huge pools of lightly regulated capital, which often borrow heavily and use complex trading strategies in an effort to generate consistent above-market returns. But Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson made it clear that major new regulations were not needed and any systemic risks posed by hedge funds could be mitigated through market discipline and the risk management practices of banks and other regulated counterparties. "These guidelines should serve as a foundation to enhance vigilance and market discipline further, which will strengthen investor protection and guard against systemic risk. We will continue to monitor developments in this ever-evolving market," Paulson said in a statement on Thursday.
