 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co. ( KO.N ) Chief Executive E. Neville Isdell on Thursday reiterated that the soft drink maker expects solid long-term growth in revenue and volume and high-single-digit growth in earnings per share despite "strong headwinds" in North America. 


 Less than two weeks after the company reported lower fourth-quarter net income, Isdell said Coke expects long-term growth of 3 to 4 percent in volume and 6 to 8 percent in revenue. His presentation to the Consumer Analyst Group of New York meeting in Scottsdale, Arizona, was also available in a Webcast. He did not give a figure for estimated earnings per share, saying only high single digit growth. The Atlanta-based company will achieve these targets by pursuing growth opportunities in emerging markets and focus on innovating and expanding its core brands, Isdell said. Isdell also said the company has the potential to gain a total of $98 billion in its top 22 markets between 2006 and 2010. However, growth in the North American market will continue to lag for the first half of 2007. "The headwinds in 2007 in North America are very strong," Isdell said. "It's going to be a very tough year for bottlers and for Coca-Cola North America." Coke reported lower fourth-quarter profit on February 14. Earnings were dragged down by an asset write-down at Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. ( CCE.N ), Coke's largest bottler, because of higher raw materials costs and lower-than-expected volume. The company expects the North American home market growth to pick up in the second half of 2007, Isdell said. "We hope to have cycled through some of the increases in basic raw material costs," he said. The company also expects the launch of new products like Diet Coke Plus to drive growth in North America. Coke plans to expand its existing light and diet brands into new markets. Coke Zero -- which Isdell said was the company's most successful brand launch in 20 years -- will be launched in 35 markets by the end of 2007. Isdell was brought out of retirement to lead the company in 2004 after the departure of Douglas Daft. Coke shares fell 30 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $47.28 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has traded between $40.80 and $49.35 in the past 52 weeks.
