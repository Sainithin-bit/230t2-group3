 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Sempra Energy ( SRE.N ) said on Thursday its earnings fell in the fourth quarter, hurt by a $221 million charge related to its Argentine utilities. 


 San Diego-based Sempra, parent of two Southern California gas and electric utilities, said net income was $125 million, or 47 cents a share, compared with $355 million, or $1.38 a share, in the year-ago quarter.
