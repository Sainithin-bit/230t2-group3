 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - The strong valuation of engineering and construction firm KBR Inc. ( KBR.N ) will likely prompt directors of parent company Halliburton Co. ( HAL.N ) to vote to give KBR shareholders a chance to exchange stock in Halliburton for their newly listed business, analysts said. 


 The transaction called a split-off would replace the oilfield service giant Halliburton's previous plan to separate KBR through a tax-free spin-off that would distribute its shares to all the current Halliburton shareholders. On its fourth-quarter earnings conference call, Halliburton said its board was also contemplating a more unusual split off of its KBR shares, with a decision due at the end of the month. Under that scenario, Halliburton shareholders would have the opportunity to exchange their shares for those of KBR at a set price, typically a discount to the market. "Given the relative performance of KBR versus Halliburton, my sense is they are going to do a split-off," Poe Fratt, analyst at A.G. Edwards, said. "What the market is telling us is that it likes the prospects for engineering and construction better than oilfield services." Shares of KBR, the Pentagon's largest contractor in Iraq, have risen about 10 percent since the unit's stock market debut in November at $17 a share. The 2007 price-to-earnings ratio for engineering and construction firm KBR is about 19, while the same ratio for Halliburton shares is about 12. Halliburton owns about 81 percent of KBR, or 136 million shares. A split-off will also allow Halliburton to shrink the number of shares it has outstanding as its holders swap stock for KBR. "In one sense, a split-off will allow Halliburton to continue doing what it wants to do, which is buy back stock," Joe Agular, an analyst with Johnson Rice, said. Agular cautioned, however, that there is a question of whether Halliburton shareholders will want $2 billion worth of KBR shares. He said someone who wants to invest in oilfield services might not be interested in owning shares of an engineering and construction firm. KBR has faced several investigations into alleged overbilling in Iraq. Halliburton for years has been working to split off KBR, which has been a drag on its more profitable oil services business. Shares of KBR were unchanged at $22.84 while Halliburton was up 3 percent at $31.26. Both trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
