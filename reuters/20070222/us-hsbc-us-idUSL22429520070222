 LONDON  (Reuters) - Europe's biggest bank HSBC Holdings ( HSBA.L ) has ousted the head of its North American operations, Bobby Mehta, in the wake of this month's shock profit warning from its troubled U.S. mortgage business. 


 The bank also replaced the head of its New York-based retail banking operation, HSBC Bank USA. HSBC said Mehta stepped down as chief executive of HSBC Finance Corp. and as head of HSBC North America with effect from February 15. His departure is a sign of action being taken by HSBC's Chief Executive Michael Geoghegan after the bank warned on February 7 that its charge for bad debts would be more than $10.5 billion for the year, or $1.8 billion more than analysts had expected. Geoghegan said at that time he would take direct action to manage the group's response to a deepening problem in the United States due to its lending to lower quality home borrowers. "The buck stops with me," he said, adding: "My hands are all over this." Mehta will be replaced at HSBC Finance by Brendan McDonagh, previously chief operating officer at the unit. HSBC also appointed Paul Lawrence as president and CEO of HSBC Bank USA and HSBC USA Inc. with immediate effect, replacing Sandy Derickson, who is leaving the bank. Lawrence will retain his role as head of HSBC's investment banking business in North America and have dual reporting lines to Geoghegan and Stuart Gulliver, head of the investment bank. TROUBLED TIMES New HSBC Finance CEO McDonagh, 48, joined HSBC in 1979 as a graduate and the Irishman held positions in group strategy and in Asia, before moving to the United States in 2002. HSBC Finance is the bank's U.S. consumer finance business and incorporates Household International, which it bought for $14.8 billion in 2003, its biggest ever acquisition. Mehta joined HSBC as part of that deal, after arriving at Household in 1998 from Boston Consulting Group. Problems in the U.S. housing market have hit several lenders, but HSBC has warned that conditions have deteriorated three times in as many months, highlighting that its credit scoring system is flawed, analysts said. By midday HSBC shares were down 0.1 percent at 907-1/2 pence, valuing the bank at 106 billion pounds ($206.7 billion). The shares have fallen 10 percent since it first warned of U.S. mortgage problems in mid-November. ($1=.5128 Pound)
