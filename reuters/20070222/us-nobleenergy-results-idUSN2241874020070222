 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Noble Energy Inc. ( NBL.N ) said on Thursday its fourth-quarter profit fell as weakness in natural gas prices weighed on results. 


 Net profit declined to $165 million, or 95 cents a share, from $222 million, or $1.27 a share, a year earlier. Excluding charges of $13.1 million, the oil and gas producer said earnings were $1.03 per basic share. Analysts had expected profit of $1.01 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose to $714.2 million from $701 million. In the latest quarter, the company's average realized natural gas price decreased 20 percent to $5.56 per thousand cubic feet from $6.91 a year earlier. (Additional reporting by  Matt Daily )
