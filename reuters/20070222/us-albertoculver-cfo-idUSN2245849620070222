 SCOTTSDALE, Arizona  (Reuters) - Alberto-Culver Co Inc. ACV.N plans to name Kraft executive Ralph Nicoletti as its chief financial officer on Monday, the company's chief executive told Reuters on Thursday. 


 Alberto, which makes products such as Nexxus shampoo, said in November that CFO William Cernugel planned to retire once the company appointed a successor. Nicoletti has held various positions at Kraft, including senior vice president of finance for its North American division.
