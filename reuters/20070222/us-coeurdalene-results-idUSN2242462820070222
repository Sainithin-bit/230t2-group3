 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Coeur d'Alene Mines Corp. ( CDE.N ) said on Thursday that fourth-quarter earnings more than doubled as higher prices for silver and gold offset lower production. 


 The U.S. silver company said its quarterly profit rose to $23.2 million, or 8 cents a share, from $9.9 million, or 4 cents a share, a year before. Analysts, on average, had forecast earnings of 8 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue in the quarter rose to $67.1 million from $51.3 million a year before, also outpacing Wall Street expectations of $64.9 million. Coeur currently expects its existing mines to produce about 13 million ounces of silver in 2007 with a cash cost of about $2.35 per ounce. The company expects to complete construction of its San Bartolome project in Bolivia later this year. "We expect silver and gold markets to remain robust during 2007. We believe that strong demand for silver is likely to support healthy market prices well beyond this year." said Dennis Wheeler, its chief executive.
