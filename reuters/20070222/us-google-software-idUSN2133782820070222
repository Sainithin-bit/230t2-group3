 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Web search leader Google Inc. has begun delivering a set of essential business software tools to paying subscribers, in a move to widen its appeal to corporate customers, the company said on Wednesday. 


 Google Apps-Premier Edition costs $50 per employee account per year, which covers telephone technical support, up to 10 gigabytes of data storage per user and guarantees that e-mail services will run at least 99.9 percent of the time. Google Apps, introduced six months ago as a free service, already offers a collection of Web-based programs including Gmail e-mail, a shared calendar program and Google Talk instant messaging. It gives each employee a personalized home page with which to track the latest information from across the Web. More than 100,000 small businesses use the existing free, advertising-supported Google Apps service, while hundreds of universities around the world already are using a free version of the service that is free of ads, Google officials said. By breaking with the traditional business software approach of installing software on individual personal computers, Google believes it can attract large numbers of business users that go underserved by the likes of Microsoft Corp., IBM, Oracle Corp. or SAP AG. "We have a volume goal ... for millions and millions of users," Google Chief Executive Eric Schmidt said in a phone interview. While big-business buying cycles will take time, he cautioned, "we have lots of indications of very large deals." Google promises to manage centrally all the technical complexity of e-mail, scheduling and other basic business tasks, reaching for new audiences instead of taking aim at established software franchises such as Microsoft's Office software. "We can offer a more functional product for a lower price," Schmidt said, contrasting its Web-based software with rival Web-based offerings Microsoft now markets as Microsoft Live. Google Apps-Premier Edition is the new version of the company's Internet software meant to help large organizations incorporate Google tools into the complex management schemes which big businesses use to control their computer networks. Google said all three editions of Google Apps now include Google Docs & Spreadsheets, which allows teams of users to collaborate online in writing and editing word processing or spreadsheet documents. Apps now allow company Gmail users to read their e-mail on Blackberry mobile e-mail phone devices. "There's an interesting play here," said Kyle McNabb of Forrester Research in Cambridge, Massachusetts. "What Microsoft has done over the past decade has been to very much focus on enterprise rather than individual needs." The irony here is that Microsoft became popular in business by solving individual problems with applications such as Word, Excel and other programs, McNabb noted. "Guess who's doing that same thing now? Google. This puts pressure on Microsoft to return to putting more focus on the individual user," he said. Potential Google Apps customers include retail store clerks, customer service phone operators and manufacturing workers -- jobs where companies are often reluctant to equip with more expensive computer systems, said Dave Girouard, vice president of Google's business unit, in an interview. Google has a chance to address the market for lower-cost, or lower-skilled information workers, McNabb said, but he noted that Microsoft, IBM and others are competitive here, too. "Although large enterprises, in general, will move slowly to adopt Google Apps, they have small teams that are looking to innovate and who can move quickly to adopt it," Schmidt said. Software partners including Avaya Inc., a top provider of Internet phone switchboards for businesses, and Postini, an e-mail security provider, are embedding features of Google Apps into their own software, Girouard said, joining big software makers IBM and BEA Systems, which are making Google Apps work with some of their own programs. Among universities, the biggest deal Google has signed to date is with the government of Egypt to supply Google Apps to 3 million university students and 8 million secondary students, Google officials said. Besides English, Google Apps is available in languages including French, Italian, German, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese and Korean.
