 SCOTTSDALE, Arizona  (Reuters) - PepsiCo Inc. ( PEP.N ) plans to introduce a new, energized version of Diet Pepsi that includes more caffeine, as well as ginseng, a PepsiCo spokesman confirmed on Wednesday. 


 The drink, Diet Pepsi Max is geared toward consumers ages 25 to 34 who like the buzz of drinks like PepsiCo's Mountain Dew, but are starting to become more concerned about their weight, the spokesman said. Diet Pepsi Max will have about one-third more caffeine than Diet Mountain Dew, the spokesman said, confirming a story on the Web site of Beverage Digest, a magazine that follows the beverage industry. The drink is scheduled to be launched in June, the PepsiCo spokesman said.
