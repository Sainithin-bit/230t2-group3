 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - PepsiCo Inc. ( PEP.N ), the world's second-largest soft drink company, on Thursday said it plans to introduce Flat Earth fruit chips later this year as it looks to expand its line of health-conscious products. 


 Flat Earth, which features slices of real fruit, will hit the market later this year and will be sold in the produce sections of supermarkets nationwide, said John Compton, head of PepsiCo's North American Division, while speaking at the Consumer Analyst Group of New York Conference in Scottsdale, Arizona. Compton also said PepsiCo -- also a major snack-food maker -- will continue looking to acquire companies that make "good-for-you" items, like Naked Juice, the maker of all-natural juices and smoothies which it acquired last year from private equity firm North Castle Partners LLC. PepsiCo also announced plans to introduce Gatorade A.M., a sports drink aimed at consumers who exercise in the morning, and Tava, a caffeine-free beverage aimed at baby boomers.
