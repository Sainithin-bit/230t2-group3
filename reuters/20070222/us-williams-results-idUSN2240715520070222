 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - Natural gas producer and pipeline company Williams Cos. Inc. ( WMB.N ) posted better-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday as higher margins for natural gas liquids offset weaker gas prices. 


 But the company trimmed its 2007 earnings forecast, citing high gas production costs and expectations that margins for liquids such as propane, ethane and butane will slip from record 2006 levels. Williams shares slipped 1.5 percent to $27.91 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange, compared with a rise of 0.1 percent in the Standard & Poor's Energy index .GSPE. Profit in the fourth quarter was $146.4 million, or 24 cents per share, up from $66.8 million, or 11 cents a share, a year earlier. The latest earnings included a gain of $40 million from the resolution of federal tax litigation, and a charge of $16 million related to an exploration and production investment. Recurring income from continuing operations -- adjusted for the value of its trading positions -- was $180.4 million, or 30 cents per share, compared with $154.3 million, or 26 cents per share, a year earlier. On that basis, analysts had expected 26 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue in the quarter fell to $2.8 billion from $3.6 billion a year earlier. "We expect strong NGL margins once again will help support the company's performance, but at levels that are likely to be less than the record-high margins we experienced last year," Steve Malcolm, Williams' chief executive officer, said in a statement. The Tulsa, Oklahoma-based company cut the 2007 earnings forecast for its business units by about $75 million, to between $1.9 billion and $2.4 billion, as the liquids margins soften and because of higher costs for gas production. That forecast puts Williams' overall 2007 earnings estimate at $1.10 to $1.50 per share, compared with analysts' average forecast of $1.43. Williams' exploration and production arm reported a profit of $139.6 million in the fourth quarter, down from $206.4 million a year earlier, as higher production volumes were offset by a 21 percent drop in sales prices and higher operating costs. Proved reserves at year-end 2006 rose 9.5 percent from the end of 2005 to 3.7 trillion cubic feet equivalent. The company's midstream unit, with provides natural gas gathering and processing services, posted a fourth-quarter profit of $163.9 million, up from $112.4 million a year earlier.
