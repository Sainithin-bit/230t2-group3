 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - California utility PG&E Corp. ( PCG.N ) posted lower fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday, hurt by severance costs from streamlining operations at its Pacific Gas & Electric utility.

Earnings from continuing operations were 48 cents per share. Analysts, on average, were expecting a profit of 44 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. The company said it raised its 2007 earnings forecast to a range of $2.70 to $2.80. The average earnings forecast of analysts was $2.71. PG&E shares rose 20 cents to $48.11 in early New York Stock Exchange trading. They have gained about 27 percent over the past twelve months, ahead of the Standard and Poor's utility index's gains of about 19 percent.
