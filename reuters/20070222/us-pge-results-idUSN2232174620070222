 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - California utility PG&E Corp. ( PCG.N ) posted lower fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday, hurt by severance costs from streamlining operations at its Pacific Gas & Electric utility. 


 PG&E said net income fell to $152 million, or 43 cents per share, from $180 million, or 49 cents per share, a year earlier. Earnings from continuing operations were 48 cents per share. Analysts, on average, were expecting a profit of 44 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. The company said it raised its 2007 earnings forecast to a range of $2.70 to $2.80. The average earnings forecast of analysts was $2.71. Year-end 2006 income was $991 million, compared with $917 million in 2005. Pacific Gas & Electric Co. is the largest utility in California with 5.2 million residential customers. PG&E Chief Executive Officer Peter Darbee touted the company's green power efforts during a conference call on Thursday with investors. PG&E by the end of the decade will have 18 percent of the electricity it delivers made from renewable sources, such as wind and solar, Darbee said. "This is of great value to the shareholders in the longer term," he said, adding that PG&E is able to attract workers that it was not able to lure years ago because of its role in helping California set ambitious goals for reducing global warming greenhouse gases. RATE CASE DECISION SEEN MID-MARCH Operating revenue in 2006 was $12.54 billion, up from $11.7 billion in 2005. Annual revenue from electricity operations was $8.7 billion, up from $7.9 billion, while revenue from natural gas operations was $3.79 billion, up from $3.78 billion. A California Public Utilities Commission administrative law judge last week issued a proposed decision in PG&E's general rate case that would reduce its revenue requirement by $43 million in 2007. In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, PG&E said overall revenue at its utility would increase $213 million to fund its gas and electric operations in Northern California from 2007-2010, if approved by the CPUC. A decision on the rate case is expected in mid-March. Darbee said that PG&E favors expanded nuclear power in the United States, but would not say when pressed by investors whether it would seek nuclear power generation outside of California. State law prohibits any new nuclear power plants until the United States becomes unstuck on attempts to establish a nuclear waste dump. PG&E has one nuclear power station, the Diablo Canyon plant near San Luis Obispo, California. Darbee said he was pleased with that plant's operation. No new nuclear power plant has been given a license since the late 1970s. PG&E shares were down 10 cents to $47.81 in New York Stock Exchange trading, hitting a high earlier Thursday of $48.25 and a low of $47.52. They have gained about 27 percent over the past twelve months, ahead of the Standard and Poor's utility index's gains of about 19 percent.
