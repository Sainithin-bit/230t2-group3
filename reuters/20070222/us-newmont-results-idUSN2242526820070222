 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Newmont Mining Corp. ( NEM.N ), the world's second-largest gold producer, said on Thursday that fourth-quarter profit more than tripled on sharply higher gold prices. The company also said it expects lower sales of the precious metal this year due to decreased production from its Yanacocha mine in Peru and its Australian operations. It forecast 2007 sales of 5.2 million to 5.6 million equity ounces, down from 5.87 million in 2006. Equity ounces are Newmont's share of the gold it mines. The company said it expects its cost per ounce of gold sold to rise 25 percent this year. Newmont's average price for gold sold in the fourth quarter was $619 an ounce, up from $472 a year earlier. Gold sales in the quarter fell to 1.7 million equity ounces from 1.8 million a year earlier. Net earnings in the quarter were $223 million, or 49 cents per share, compared with $62 million, or 14 cents per share, a year earlier, the Denver-based company said. Excluding a tax credit, a litigation settlement, discontinued operations and other special items, Newmont earned about 45 cents a share. On that basis, analysts' average forecast was 39 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose to $1.46 billion from $1.29 billion. Barrick Gold Corp. ( ABX.TO ), the world's biggest gold producer, said on Thursday its fourth-quarter profit more than doubled, lifted by higher prices and increased production. Newmont said it had added 52.5 million ounces of gold to its reserves over the last five years. In 2006, the company added 11.6 million equity ounces, outpacing its reserves depleted, expropriated or revised by about 700,000 equity ounces. In 2006 it brought into production two mines in Nevada and its Ahafo mine in Ghana. But it said it did not expect to receive the full benefits of its investment in those projects and in its Boddington project in Australia in 2007. Newmont shares rose $1.07, or 2.3 percent, to $48.05 in early New York Stock Exchange trading. Shares of Barrick Gold were off 15 Canadian cents at C$37.10 in Toronto.
