 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Newmont Mining Corp. ( NEM.N ), the world's second-largest gold producer, said on Thursday that fourth-quarter profit more than tripled on sharply higher gold prices. 


 The company also said it expects lower gold sales this year before it starts to receive full production from mines in Nevada, Ghana and Australia. It forecast 2007 sales of 5.2 million to 5.6 million equity ounces, down from 5.87 million in 2006. Equity ounces are Newmont's share of the gold it mines. Newmont's average price for gold sold in the fourth quarter was $619 an ounce, up from $472 a year earlier. Net earnings in the quarter were $223 million, or 49 cents per share, compared with $62 million, or 14 cents per share, a year earlier, the Denver-based company said. Revenue rose to $1.46 billion from $1.29 billion.
