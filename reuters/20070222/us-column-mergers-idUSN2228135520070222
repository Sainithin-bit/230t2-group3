 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The recent woes of Citigroup ( C.N ) have encouraged some investment bankers to talk up the chances that the biggest U.S. bank might feel pressure to buy a major U.S. rival, with Wells Fargo & Co. ( WFC.N ) and even Goldman Sachs Group ( GS.N ) touted as potential merger partners. 


 But some investors say Citigroup needs to get its own house in order before considering any transformational transaction. Indeed, Citi's embattled chief executive, Charles Prince, has indicated his company would stick to its recent policy of making most of its acquisitions outside the United States as he strives to make the company more international. Prince has said Citigroup is unlikely to buy a large U.S. bank in 2007 because valuations remain high and other markets offer good growth. Citi's international deals in the past year or so have tended to be on a smaller scale. "If Chuck Prince wants to lose his job fast, rather than slow, he'll do a big acquisition -- because a big acquisition would slaughter the stock," said Punk Ziegel & Co. analyst Richard Bove, a supporter of the Citigroup CEO. Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo declined to comment for this article. Some investors have criticized Prince, who faces growing pressure to cut costs, increase profit, rebuild a depleted management team and boost Citigroup's stock price. Citigroup's 2006 profit increase trailed gains at the company's largest U.S. rivals, Bank of America Corp. ( BAC.N ) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. ( JPM.N ) Talk persists among investment bankers that Citigroup may be compelled to do a major U.S. deal, with some even suggesting a merger would be one sure way of boosting its management team, which has lost a number of key executives. However, Citigroup's most recent transactions certainly back up Prince's statements. In December, Citi said it would buy Central American bank Grupo Cuscatlan for $1.51 billion, and in October it agreed to buy Grupo Financiero Uno, the largest credit card issuer in that region. Manuel Medina-Mora, chairman and CEO of Citigroup Latin America and Mexico, has told Reuters that the company is keen to grow partly through acquisitions there, with Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Colombia and Central America among the priority markets. In October, Citi agreed to pay $3.1 billion for a 20 percent stake in Turkey's Akbank and in November, it led a consortium that won control of China's Guangdong Development Bank for $3.1 billion. More recently, Citi said last month that it would buy Internet bank Egg from Britain's Prudential Plc ( PRU.L ) for about $1.1 billion. On Monday, Citigroup said it was considering listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, a move that would allow it to make acquisitions in Japan more easily. Citigroup is seen as a top candidate to buy Japan's Nikko Cordial Corp. 8603.T if the TSE decides next month to revoke the scandal-hit brokerage's share listing. INVESTOR IMPATIENCE Many Citigroup investors have lost patience as Citi's share price has struggled to keep pace with rivals. Some recommend radical action. "If anything, the path they need to go down is breaking themselves up, if they want to create shareholder value," said Citigroup shareholder William Smith, CEO of SAM Advisors LLC, a long-time critic of the company. Some shareholders are unconvinced that Citigroup's current management is capable of getting the many pieces of its empire -- retail and investment banking, trading, credit cards, the Smith Barney brokerage and a private bank -- to work better together. Media reports last month on ousted wealth management chief Todd Thomson's friendship with CNBC television anchor Maria Bartiromo added to the pressure on Prince. On January 19, Citigroup said fourth-quarter profit rose just 3 percent, as a 23 percent jump in costs outpaced a 15 percent increase in revenue. Three days later, Citigroup removed chief financial officer Sallie Krawcheck and made her wealth management chief. The changes left Citigroup management without a CFO and with few potential successors to Prince. "I think the entire place is a dysfunctional mess and these guys are basically acting like the keystone cops," said Smith of SAM Advisors. But he added: "Citigroup is not broken -- they're still generating massive profits." Citigroup's operating profit rose 7 percent last year to $21.25 billion. Still, the company's biggest shareholder, Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, has demanded tighter cost controls, and CEO Prince has ordered Chief Operating Officer Robert Druskin to slice into the bank's $52.02 billion expense base. That's what many investors want to hear before any speculation of deals. SAM Advisors' Smith concluded: "The last thing in the world Citigroup needs to do is buy somebody."
