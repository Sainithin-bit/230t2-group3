 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wireless chip maker Atheros Communications Inc ATHR.O could see increased demand for its products with the spread of Wi-Fi technology in popular products like Apple Inc's ( AAPL.O ) new touch-screen iPods, the financial newspaper Barron's reported in its September 10 edition. 

 Atheros shares are trading at about 15 percent below a mid-July peak as the company's outlook disappointed investors in late July. But Barron's reported that American Technology Research analyst Shaw Wu thinks the stock is well positioned to garner more market share in a growing Wi-Fi enabled consumer electronics market. The business weekly also suggested that large chip makers may become more interested in acquiring Wi-Fi specialists, like Atheros, to round out their offerings. Atheros shares closed on Friday at $28.96 on the Nasdaq.
