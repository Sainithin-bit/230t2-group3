 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of telephone services company IDT Corp IDTc.N, which are already down 40 percent this year, could fall further amid management shuffles and a rapidly decreasing cash stockpile, the financial newspaper Barron's said in its September 10 edition. 

 The Newark, New Jersey-based company's cash reserves are under pressure from new dividend payouts, the business weekly reported. As IDT's calling card, local and long-distance businesses are hurt by wireless and Internet calling services, Barron's said it could burn through its cash in as few as two years. The company has changed chief financial officers several times this year and insider stock sales are beginning to frustrate shareholders, Barron's reported. "Why aren't directors and executives buying meaningful positions in the stock?" Thomas Graham Kahn, president of Kahn Brothers & Co, which holds a large position in the stock, told Barron's. Kahn last month wrote a letter to  Howard Jonas, the company's founder and chairman, saying he felt insider stock sales and a lack of insider stock purchases "belied" management's optimism, Barron's reported. IDT also faces potential tax troubles, as the Internal Revenue Service is investigating its 2001 through 2004 returns, Barron's reported. IDT shares closed at $8.40 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday, but Barron's said the stock could be worth just $7.87 per share.
