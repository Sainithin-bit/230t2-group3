 VIENNA  (Reuters) - The oil market faces no shortage of crude at present, Qatari Oil Minister Abdullah al-Attiyah told reporters on Sunday. 

 He said the situation could change in the face of a harsh winter and reiterated that OPEC was ready to supply any real market need if required. "So far I am confident there is no shortage of supply," Attiyah said on his arrival for Tuesday's OPEC meeting. "If this coming year the winter is going to be very severe, this is a different story," he added. The minister said he believed world oil stocks were "very comfortable."
