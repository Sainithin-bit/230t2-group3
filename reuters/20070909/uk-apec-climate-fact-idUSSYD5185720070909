 (Reuters) - Asia-Pacific leaders agreed at a weekend summit to adopt a "long-term aspirational goal" to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 

 Here is a list of the main points: CLIMATE CHANGE, ENERGY SECURITY AND CLEAN DEVELOPMENT -- APEC nations, including China and the United States, agree to work to achieve a common understanding on a long-term aspirational global emissions reduction goal to pave the way for an effective post-2012 international arrangement. -- Reaffirm commitment to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Post-Kyoto arrangement needs to reflect differences in economic and social conditions among economies. ACTION AGENDA -- Work towards achieving an APEC-wide regional aspirational goal of a reduction in energy intensity of at least 25 percent by 2030, with 2005 as the base year. -- Work to achieve an APEC-wide aspirational goal of increasing forest cover in the region by at least 20 million hectares of all types of forests by 2020. If achieved, this would store about 1.4 billion tonnes of carbon, equal to 11 percent of annual global emissions in 2004. -- Set up Asia-Pacific networks to strengthen research on clean fossil fuels, renewable energy sources and forestry. REACTION -- Greenpeace described the Sydney Declaration as a distraction from real action on climate change, saying binding targets to reduce emissions were needed rather than "vague and voluntary" goals.
