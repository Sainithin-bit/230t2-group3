 JOHANNESBURG  (Reuters) - Mining group BHP Billiton Ltd/Plc ( BHP.AX ) ( BLT.L ) will phase out business with Standard Bank Group ( SBKJ.J ) in the first corporate spat brought on by South Africa's power crisis. 

 BHP, the world's biggest mining group, had carried out annual business worth more than 2.4 billion rand ($300 million) with Standard Bank, BHP Billiton's South African chairman Vincent Maphai said in a letter to employees. The letter, seen by Reuters, said a senior Standard Bank executive had recommended at a meeting between business and the government that BHP Billiton's Hillside aluminium smelter be shut down to free up more electricity. South African mining groups have been struggling to cope with only 90 percent of their usual power after a national power crisis forced the closure of mines for five days in January. BHP Billiton said on March 11 it would halve operations at its Bayside smelter, while Hillside in South Africa and Mozal in Mozambique would operate on 90 percent of their power needs. "In that context, and given his apparent ignorance of the issues at hand, we believe that Standard Bank's remarks were reckless, provocative and irresponsible," Maphai said in the letter. BHP spokeswoman Bronwyn Wilkinson confirmed that the mining group will seek other banking partners. "I can confirm that BHP Billiton has taken a corporate decision to phase out its business with Standard Bank," he said. REGRETTABLE ROW A Johannesburg-based analyst said the public disagreement between the two groups was regrettable. "I think this has been blown out of context by both parties. It is regrettable that responsible high-level businessmen got involved in this," the analyst said. He said BHP's decision to pull its business may have a slight impact on Standard Bank. "There will a financial impact on Standard Bank but I don't think it will actually be enough to make a big story about," the analyst said. Standard Bank said in a statement it had received correspondence from BHP Billiton related to the "national electricity challenge". "Standard Bank has a valued relationship with BHP Billiton having provided it with a range of banking services for many years, and we will engage with BHP Billiton on this particular matter as a part of this relationship," the banking group said. South Africa's mining companies were ordered in January by utility Eskom ESKJ.UL to cut power usage by 10 percent to help solve the power crisis that has driven up metals prices and slowed the country's growth. It prompted some mining companies to cut production forecasts and warn of job losses. Since then power consumption at some mining firms has been allowed to creep up to 95 percent of full power. Maphai said in the letter that the termination of business with Standard Bank would begin with money market accounts, foreign exchange and guarantees. The decision had been taken with full support of BHP Billiton Chief Executive Officer Marius Kloppers, he said. Shares in Standard Bank fell 1.9 percent to 91.75 rand by 1235 GMT, compared with a 1.3 percent decline in the JSE Securities Exchange's banking sector. (Editing by  David Holmes )
