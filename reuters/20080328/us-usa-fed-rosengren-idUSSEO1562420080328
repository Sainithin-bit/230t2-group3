 SEOUL  (Reuters) - The woes of U.S. banks could mount as the economy slows down and with greater access to their confidential information, the Federal Reserve can make sound decisions, Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said on Friday. 

 "I would say that while to date the problem banks have been quite low, there clearly has been some deterioration since the beginning of this year, and should the economy continue to slow down, as many expect, it is likely that we will continue to see some growth in the problem institutions," he told a seminar at the Bank of Korea. Rosengren is regarded as one of the most dovish members of the Fed, but is not a voting member of the central bank's Federal Open Market Committee this year. The Fed last week slashed benchmark lending rates by a hefty three-quarters of a percentage point to a three-year low of 2.25 percent, in addition to the other measures it has introduced to keep money flowing in markets. Investors think it will cut rates again at its next scheduled policy meeting, on April 29-30. "It is too soon to call whether or not we are in a recession. But regardless of what you call it, it is a period of very slow growth," he told reporters at the seminar. "Slow growth does have the implication that you would expect a gradual increase in the unemployment rate," he said. On the troubles caused by the subprime loan crisis, he said: "We need to see some stabilization in the housing market before I would be confident that the financial turmoil is over." Rosengren said public earnings statements often do not offer enough of a basis for prudent policy. "While U.S. banks report detailed information on their balance sheets and their income statements, these reports do not provide sufficient information to allow central banks to really discern how banks are responding to problems," he said in a prepared text. Troubles that began with rising mortgage defaults has since infected the broader financial system, igniting the worst credit crisis in decades. Rosengren said the turbulence was difficult to foresee because bank models focused solely on their exposure to riskier assets like subprime mortgages, ignoring the possible knock-on effects on other sectors. "What these stress tests crucially failed to capture was the effect of house price declines on the large holdings of highly rated securities that global banks held -- the products of mortgage securitization activities, with their payment streams ultimately tied to the performance of subprime loans," he said. The belief that housing prices would never fall on a national basis, which permeated even the Fed itself, was partly to blame for this underestimation of risk, Rosengren said.
