 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Clear Channel Communications Inc ( CCU.N ) said on Friday its board of directors has deferred a first-quarter dividend. 

 The board was asked to delay the dividend payment date by Bain Capital and Thomas H. Lee Partners in light of the delayed closing of Clear Channel's merger with CC Media Holdings Inc. (Reporting by  Gina Keating )
