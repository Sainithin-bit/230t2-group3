 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Representatives of the Bancroft family, which controls Dow Jones & Co. Inc. DJ.N, plan to meet with News Corp. NWSa.N chief Rupert Murdoch on Monday to discuss his $5 billion bid for the company, The Wall Street Journal reported on its Web site Friday, citing sources familiar with the matter. 

 The meeting is expected to deal solely with issues related to journalistic integrity, these people said, according to the Journal. The Journal also reported that Michael Elefante, a partner at the law firm that represents the Bancroft family, has changed his mind about considering selling Dow Jones, the Journal reported. Elefante now has said the company should consider a sale to Murdoch or another bidder in order for the media company to remain competitive, the Journal reported, citing sources. Dow Jones publishes the Journal, Barron's and Dow Jones Newswires, which compete with Reuters Group Plc RTR.L and others in providing financial news.
