 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - General Mills Inc ( GIS.N ) on Wednesday posted a 1 percent increase in quarterly profit, as higher sales were partially offset by more expensive marketing and a pizza recall. 

 The maker of brands including Cheerios cereal, Progresso soup and Pillsbury cookie dough also stood by its full-year earnings forecast, with better-than-expected sales being offset by soaring costs for energy and ingredients such as corn and dairy products. Chief Executive Ken Powell said the continued higher costs would also be offset by more price increases, which the world's second-biggest maker of breakfast cereal plans to undertake in the second half of its fiscal year. "Commodity prices have tracked above our estimates," he said. "We expect this general inflationary environment we've been in for last three or four years ... to continue." General Mills said it had planned for total input cost inflation to increase 5 percent in fiscal 2008, but now estimates a 7 percent increase. The company has already increased the price per ounce of its cereal by using smaller boxes and has taken other measures to offset those costs. Powell said General Mills has not seen customer resistance to the price changes that have hit shelves this year. "They are doing as good a job as anyone of navigating this input cost environment," Edward Jones analyst Matt Arnold said. Arnold rates the stock a "buy." Wachovia analyst Jonathan Feeney said in a research note that he expects the good momentum to continue at the company. "We continue to think General Mills and the food industry have excellent pricing power that at least offsets the cost inflation," Feeney said. He rates the stock at "outperform." Net income for the fiscal second quarter that ended November 25, was $390.5 million, or $1.14 per share, compared with $385.4 million, or $1.08 per share, a year ago, the company said. Earnings in the most recent quarter included 4 cents a share in expenses for a frozen pizza recall. Earnings matched the average analyst estimate, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 6.8 percent to $3.70 billion. Analysts, on average, had been expecting sales of $3.62 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Strength in the Yoplait yogurt and snack bars businesses lifted sales, as well as a weaker U.S. dollar, which boosts the dollar value of overseas sales. U.S. retail segment sales rose 3 percent in the quarter, while international sales were up 22 percent. Operating profit was about flat. The company backed its full-year profit view of $3.39 to $3.43 per share, but raised its sales forecast to an increase in the mid-single digits from its previous forecast of a low-single-digit increase. But some were skeptical about that forecast. "We see downside to (fiscal-year) guidance due to a potential slowdown in reported sales in the high-margin cereal business and our questions about the sustainability of cereal price points post resizing," Pablo Zuanic, an analyst at JP Morgan, said in a research note. He rates the stock "underweight." General Mills shares fell 84 cents to $58.20 during morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock trades at about 17 times analysts' average 2008 earnings estimate, roughly in line with the valuation of its top rival, Kellogg Co ( K.N ).
