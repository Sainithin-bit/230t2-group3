 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - German economic institute Ifo expects U.S. growth of 2 percent next year but a recession cannot be ruled out, the head of the institute said on Wednesday, putting the probability of a U.S. recession at 50:50. 

 Expectations for 2008 among German companies surveyed on a monthly basis by Ifo were moderate because of the U.S. crisis, Hans-Werner Sinn told Bloomberg TV after Ifo released its widely watched business confidence indicator for December. "We are traveling downwards from a high level," Sinn said in an interview on Bloomberg Television's German-language channel. "Expectations for next year are cautious...due to the U.S. crisis," he said. For more on the latest Ifo indicator, click on <ID:nBEB001969> <ID:nBAT001997> (Reporting by  Peter Starck )
