 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Mining equipment maker Joy Global Inc JOYG.O on Wednesday said strong market conditions would probably drive 2008 sales up as much as 18 percent, sending shares more than 8 percent higher in early trading. 

 The company -- which makes such gear as electric mining shovels, rotary blasthole drills and draglines -- reported a fourth-quarter profit that fell 18 percent due to higher taxes, of $69.6 million, or 64 cents a share, down from $85.2 million, or 71 cents, a year before. Excluding tax charges, it earned 80 cents a share, 2 cents below what analysts polled by Reuters Estimates had expected. Sales in the quarter that ended October 26 rose 7 percent to $735.9 million, above the $710.2 million forecast. Also, orders at the end of the quarter stood at a record $968 million, up 16 percent from last year. Chief Executive Mike Sutherlin said Joy Global enters its 2008 fiscal year with an improved market outlook. "The outlook for our markets is stronger than ever," he said in a statement. "Supply continues to chase demand in our international markets, including coal, copper, iron ore and the Canadian oil sands. Our customers are increasing their level of investment in future expansions. In addition, the U.S. coal market is beginning to improve." Strong international demand, improvement in the U.S. coal market, continued improvement in the replacement parts market and new capacity should boost revenue 10 percent to 18 percent in fiscal 2008, to be between $2.8 billion and $3.0 billion. That should result in net income per share in the range of $3.10 to $3.35, including an estimated 8 cents for its share buyback program. Analysts were expecting 2008 sales of $2.9 billion and earnings of $3.30 a share before one-time items, according to Reuters Estimates. The Milwaukee-based company said it would start offering only annual forecasts, which it may update, and stop giving a rolling four-quarter outlook at the end of each quarter. The company's shares rose to $60.10 in early Nasdaq trading. They have traded in a 52-week range of $65.50 to $40.36.
