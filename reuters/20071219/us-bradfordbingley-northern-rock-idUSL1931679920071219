 LONDON  (Reuters) - Britain's biggest buy-to-let lender Bradford & Bingley (B&B) BB.L has denied a report it is considering a bid for part of Northern Rock NRK.L, as the government said all options for the troubled bank remained open. 

 A report that B&B was interested in buying some of Northern Rock's NRK.L assets, sent shares in the beleaguered mortgage bank up as much as 7 percent early on Wednesday. "Contrary to reports, Bradford & Bingley is not actively pursuing a bid for any part of Northern Rock," a B&B spokeswoman said, though she said B&B was one of several parties which had received a copy of the Northern Rock briefing memorandum. A source familiar with the matter said B&B was one of a group of interested parties which looked at Northern Rock's mortgage book in the early part of the auction process, though it was unclear whether it remained interested. Northern Rock declined to comment. Britain's fifth-largest mortgage lender and now the country's biggest casualty of the global credit crunch, is being sold off as a whole, but the process has been thrown into doubt in recent weeks after some suitors withdrew and others hit funding troubles. At least two high-profile suitors remain -- investment group Olivant, led by former Abbey boss Luqman Arnold, and Richard Branson's Virgin. Should a deal fail, the bank could face nationalization or a wind-down and breakup, in which case its assets would be split up and sold to rivals such as B&B. The UK government has said it prefers a private sector solution, but is facing growing speculation that it could be forced to nationalize the former building society. Speaking a day after the finance ministry extended existing guarantees on Northern Rock's deposits to cover virtually all senior debt obligations, the government refused to rule out full nationalization. It said one of its priorities was to recover money lent by the Bank of England, currently more than 25 billion pounds ($50.13 billion). "We've always made it clear all options are on the table," finance minister Alistair Darling said. "Our objective is to give the bank the breathing space it needs so it can reach a resolution to its current problems." Northern Rock shares were up 4.4 percent at 90.7p by 9:48 a.m. EST, while Bradford & Bingley shares rose 3.1 percent. Britain's financial regulator has warned banks interested in buying mortgage books to consider whether they should be exchanging cash for illiquid assets in times of turmoil. B&B, however, said last month it had funding through to the end of next year and was "padded up for a long haul". (Editing by David Holmes/Richard Hubbard)
