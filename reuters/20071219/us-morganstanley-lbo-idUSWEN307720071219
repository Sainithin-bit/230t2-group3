 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. investment bank Morgan Stanley's ( MS.N ) Chief Financial Officer Colm Kelleher said on Wednesday he expects the bank's leveraged buyout business to decline in 2008, compared with this year. 

 Kelleher added that equity underwriting backlog has risen, citing strength in its European and Asian markets. But junk debt underwriting backlog is lower, while the investment grade debt pipeline is higher. (Reporting by  Lilla Zuill ; Editing by  Andre Grenon )
