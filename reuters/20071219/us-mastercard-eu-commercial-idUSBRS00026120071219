 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - The European Commission will rule on MasterCard's ( MA.N ) commercial card fees soon, the EU executive said on Wednesday. 

 "We won't wait too long, that's also a burden," EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes told a news conference. The Commission ruled on Wednesday that MasterCard must change within six months the way it sets a separate fee -- known as a multilateral interchange fee -- for processing personal card transactions or face daily fines.
