 MADRID  (Reuters) - Spain's Telefonica ( TEF.MC ), Europe's biggest telecoms company based on clients, has named its head of planning, Julio Linares, to become chief executive officer, Spanish newspapers reported on Wednesday. 

 Telefonica has not had a chief executive in four years and the move is intended to allow Chairman Cesar Alierta to delegate day-to-day operating responsibilities to Linares so that he can focus on strategy, the Cinco Dias newspaper reported. Telefonica declined to comment on the reports but said it would issue a statement on Wednesday morning. Telefonica is expected to announce board changes, with Manuel Pizarro, formerly chairman of power company Endesa ( ELE.MC ), and Javier de Paz replacing Maximio Carpio and Enrique Used, newspapers reported.
