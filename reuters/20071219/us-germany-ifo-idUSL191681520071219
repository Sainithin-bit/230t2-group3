 BERLIN  (Reuters) - German business morale worsened in December to its lowest since January 2006, hit by a drop in firms' assessment of current business conditions that leaves Europe's largest economy looking weak going into 2008. 

 The Munich-based Ifo economic research institute said on Wednesday its business climate index, based on a monthly poll of around 7,000 firms, registered 103.0 after 104.2 in November. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a dip to 103.8. The euro  EUR=  fell to session lows versus the dollar after the release of the data and Germany's DAX  .GDAXI  leading share index extended losses. "With business and consumer confidence falling in tandem, the German economy looks set for hard times in 2008," said Bear Stearns economist David Brown. "The specter of German recession is rising." An Ifo gauge of current conditions fell in December to 108.1 from 110.3 the previous month. A reading of 110.0 had been forecast. The survey's expectations component dipped to 98.2, above the forecast 98.0, from 98.3 in November. Ifo economist Hans Guenter Russ said the European Central Bank (ECB) should leave interest rates unchanged for now and look to trim them slightly in the second half of 2008. Earlier this month, the ECB held interest rates at 4.0 percent, but ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet said some members of the Governing Council had favored a rate rise. "The sharp drop in business confidence in Germany shows the economy crying out for lower rates," said Brown. RETAILERS SUFFER The weaker Ifo survey was marked by a particularly bleak assessment from the retail sector, where expectations were the lowest for two years. Ifo's Russ expected Christmas sales in 2007 would be below year-earlier levels. "Especially worrying is the further weakness of the Ifo indicator in retail, falling to the lowest level in two years," said Peter Vanden Houte at ING. "With exports likely to falter as a growth engine (although export expectations seem to hold up well according to the Ifo Institute), all hopes are pinned on a further recovery of domestic demand, but that isn't reflected in today's figures." Ifo said companies remained optimistic about exports, which have been a major support for the economy in recent years. Last year, a strong contribution from foreign trade helped the economy to grow by 2.9 percent -- its fastest rate in six years. "The outlook for the coming six months continues to be assessed cautiously," Ifo President Hans-Werner Sinn said in a statement. "The cyclical dynamics are weakening." Some firms have begun to complain that a rise in the euro is hurting their business. French specialty chemicals group Rhodia RHA.PA said on Tuesday it would shed 129 jobs at a site in Freiburg, Germany, as part of a restructuring of its cellulose acetate business which it said was hit by the weak dollar. The euro hit a record high of nearly $1.50 last month. A stronger euro makes German exporters' goods more expensive outside the 13-nation single European currency area. The weaker Ifo reading chimed with a deterioration in German investor sentiment to its gloomiest level in almost 15 years in December, shown in the Mannheim-based ZEW research institute's economic sentiment indicator last Tuesday.
