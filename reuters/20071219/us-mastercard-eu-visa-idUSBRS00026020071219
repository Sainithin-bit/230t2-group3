 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - The European Commission's order for MasterCard ( MA.N ) to change the way it sets fees or face fines will act as a guide for its rival Visa Europe, the EU executive said on Wednesday. 

 "We will certainly be active and not wait," EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes told a news conference. The European Commission ruled on Wednesday that MasterCard ( MA.N ) must change the way it sets its fees for processing card transactions within six months or face daily fines. Visa Europe negotiated a multi-year exemption from EU competition rules in return for capping its fees but the exemption lapses at the end of this month. Kroes said she would re-investigate Visa's fee structure from January. (Reporting by  David Lawsky ; writing by  Huw Jones ; editing by  William Schomberg )
