 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Accenture Ltd ( ACN.N ) said on Tuesday it filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Guidewire Software Inc over an insurance claims management technology. 

 Accenture said in a statement its lawsuit alleges that Guidewire "misappropriated Accenture trade secrets relating to the design, coding and implementation of the claims management technology Accenture developed and patented". Guidewire, which provides products for property and casualty insurers, rejected the claim and said it had not yet seen the complaint. "Guidewire did not and would not misappropriate trade secrets or willfully infringe on any patents," John Raguin, Guidewire's chief executive, said in a statement. "We will review the details of the allegations and respond in the appropriate manner." The suit was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware.
