 LONDON  (Reuters) - Results of coordinated central bank action to prime money markets will go some way on Wednesday to gauge the depth of the global credit crisis, while heavy losses at a top U.S. bank suggested it has some way to run. 

 Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) reported an extra $5.7 billion mortgage-related write-down in November and said it had written off a total of about $9.4 billion in the fourth quarter. The second-largest U.S. investment bank posted a net Q4 loss from continuing operations of $3.59 billion and said it had sold a $5 billion stake to China Investment Corp to boost capital. The Federal Reserve will announce at 10:00 a.m. EST the results of an unprecedented auction of $20 billion of 28-day funds -- the first under its Term Auction Facility to lend banks cash at favorable rates. The ECB and the Swiss National Bank (SNB) have also offered substantial sums, in a concerted attempt to thaw frozen money markets. In a sign of some easing of money market stress, most London interbank offered rates for sterling, euros and dollars fell on Wednesday, continuing the broad decline since top central banks unveiled their liquidity measures a week ago. "The best gauge is Libor," said Jan Hatzius, an economist for Goldman Sachs in New York. "It's already come down substantially, and should come down further if the (Term Auction Facility) is successful." The ECB's separate, unusually large injection of 348 billion euros of two-week funds into the banking system on Tuesday has also helped drag interbank rates down from sky-high levels, while the Bank of England weighed in yesterday with 10 billion pounds of three-month money. ONGOING UNCERTAINTY But most experts say the joint action, whereby the Fed, SNB, ECB, BoE, Bank of Canada and others provide fresh short-term lending, is unlikely to solve the crisis alone. U.S. subprime mortgages -- lent to people ill-equipped to pay them back -- were bundled up into complex financial products and sold on around the globe. Only when uncertainty about where the exposure lies is resolved are commercial banks likely to lend money freely to each other again on the interbank market, which oils the global economy's wheels. "We should assume that the problems are not over yet. The insecurity will last for another few months and parts of the insecurity will only be overcome once final annual balance sheets have been published," European Central Bank Governing Council member Klaus Liebscher said. Morgan Stanley's results appeared to prove the point, in stark contrast to Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) which boasted record earnings per share on Tuesday. Bear Stearns, also hard hit, reports on Thursday. Financial firms have to date written down more than $65 billion in credit-related losses. With official estimates of total losses from the subprime mortgage debacle around $300 billion, investors are braced for further shocks. All nine members of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee voted to cut interest rates by a quarter-point to 5.5 percent this month, as a result of the credit crisis, and even discussed whether a bigger reduction might be needed. "The worsening financial market turmoil, and the consequent tightening of credit conditions, had increased the downside risks to activity and inflation in the medium-term," minutes of that meeting showed on Wednesday. The European Central Bank has not followed the Fed, Bank of Canada and BoE by lowering official rates but its president, Jean-Claude Trichet, remains concerned about the financial turmoil that has gripped global markets since August. "Uncertainties surrounding the financial stability outlook for the euro area have heightened and may persist until it becomes clearer how the potential balance-sheet effects of the turbulence will be spread across individual financial institutions," Trichet told a European Parliament committee. "Given the uncertainties, the adjustment process in the financial system in the coming period may be challenging and we have to be prepared for the materialization of risks at any time."
