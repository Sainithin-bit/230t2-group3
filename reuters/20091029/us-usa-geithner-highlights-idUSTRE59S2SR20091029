 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The following are highlights from a House Financial Services Committee hearing on Thursday with U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner on granting the government "resolution authority" over failed financial firms. 

 For a text of Geithner's prepared testimony, see:  here GEITHNER ON RESOLUTION AUTHORITY IN LEHMAN CONTEXT "What this regime would allow for is for us to take a firm like Lehman and put them out of existence, have the good businesses sold off, have them resolved in a situation that would have caused less risk of broad panic. (This would have avoided) the position where you have millions of Americans, millions of investors -- people who have pension funds, municipalities, counties across the country that invested in money market funds that funded Lehman -- they would not have been exposed to that scale of losses and you would not have had the extent of the panic that you saw last fall which threatened the viability of a whole range of other institutions. GEITHNER ON GMAC: "When I came in, we put the major institutions including GMAC through a very tough stress test, forced them to disclose what their losses might be, how much capital they would need, in the event of a worse recession. At that time, we disclosed to the market and to the world, including for GMAC, what their likely capital needs would be. And we committed, in the event that they were not able to raise capital from the market, that the government would put that capital in. GMAC, at the time, there was no prospect, frankly, that they were going to be able to raise that capital from the market. All the other institutions, in contrast, have been able to go out and raise that capital from the market. The only thing we're doing is making sure we follow through on that commitment, and in fact -- although I don't want to go into any detail here -- in fact, we're likely to have to put in less capital than we expected." EXCHANGE WITH REP. PAUL KANJORKSI ON NEW GOVERNMENT POWERS UNDER REGULATORY REFORMS: Kanjorski: "Mr. Secretary, I'm not a man that fears this administration or you, but I do fear the accumulation of power exercised by someone in the future that can be extraordinary. Now, you and I know that in this last disaster, Treasury was able to determine that General Motors and the auto industry were financial institutions so they have access to TARP. I'm not sure I agree with that, but at the time, it was certainly essential if we were going to save those institutions. But what we're doing is allowing a board, or a council, or organization to make the determination in time of extremity -- no question about that -- that some of us may not agree ... that that authority rests in those entities ... or we even have the authority in this Congress to give that type of authority." Geithner: "You get to choose now what mix of authorities and limits on executive power are going to be appropriate for the future, that's the choice you'll be debating and making. What we've proposed, though, is a very carefully designed set of checks and balances, and it does limit very substantially, the authority of the executive branch." Kanjorski: "... Why should the American people sit out there and see us creating mammoth organizations that nobody says we have the authority to control or limit, but we have the authority to help them when they get in trouble?" Geithner: "... This bill would provide not just higher capital requirements on them, constraints on leverage, would have the authority to limit the scope of their activities, to compel them to shrink and separate." GEITHNER ON TOO BIG TO FAIL: "Without the ability for the government to step in and manage the failure of a large firm and contain the risk of the fire spreading, we will be consigned to repeat the experience of last fall. It's a really stark, simple thing." GEITHNER ON ASSESSING FEES ON BANKS: "Only if, as part of protecting the system from their failure, the government is exposed to losses, in that case and only to that extent would there be a fee assessed on institutions to cover it." GEITHNER ON ECONOMY: "For every person out of work, for every family facing foreclosure, for every small business facing a credit crunch, the recession remains alive and acute." "Growth will bring jobs, but we need to continue working together to strengthen the recovery and create the conditions where businesses will invest again and all Americans will have the confidence that they can provide for their families, send their kids to college, feel secure in retirement." GEITHNER ON NEED FOR RESOLUTION AUTHORITY: "Any individual firm that puts itself in a position where it cannot survive without special assistance from the government must face the consequences of failure. "The proposed resolution authority would not authorize the government to provide open-bank assistance to any failing firm. In other words, it would not permit the government to put money into a failing firm unless that firm is in government receivership and on the path to being unwound, sold or liquidated." GEITHNER ON THE BANKRUPTCY CODE: "In all but the rarest of cases, bankruptcy will remain the dominant tool for handling the failure of non-bank financial firms. But as the collapse of Lehman Brothers showed, the Bankruptcy Code is not an effective tool for resolving the failure of a global financial services firm in times of severe economic stress. "The Bankruptcy Code focuses almost exclusively on maximizing the interests of a firm's creditors, with little or no concern for spill-over effects on the financial system or the economy. It often moves too slowly. And it contains too few mechanisms for the stabilization of critical operations of a failed firm. (Washington newsroom)
