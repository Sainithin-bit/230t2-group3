 DUBLIN  (Reuters) - Swiss drugmaker Novartis ( NOVN.VX ) is in talks to buy parts of Irish peer Elan ( ELN.I ), including its flagship multiple sclerosis products and its Alzheimer's disease pipeline, the Sunday Times said. 

 A spokeswoman for Elan said it did not comment on speculation. A spokesman for Novartis declined to comment. The Sunday Times said a "well-placed source" confirmed the talks but added the "complexity of the deal made a decision some way off". Elan, a co-marketer with Biogen Idec ( BIIB.O ) of multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri, hired Citigroup in January to conduct a review of the business and said at the time a merger or sale of the company was possible. It said on June 10 it expected to conclude a strategic transaction "in the near term", after talking over the past few months with a number of the global players in pharmaceuticals and biotechnology. Chief Executive Kelly Martin then declined, however, to comment on whether discussions had broken down with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co ( BMY.N ), as a source had earlier told Reuters. Analysts say Elan is running out of options for a strategic partnership as earlier market talk of a link-up with companies such as U.S. giant Pfizer Inc ( PFE.N ) or Denmark's Lundbeck ( LUN.CO ) have all turned out to be unfounded so far.
