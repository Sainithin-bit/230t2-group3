 MELBOURNE  (Reuters) - National Australia Bank ( NAB.AX ), Australia's top lender, offered $12 billion for insurer AXA Asia Pacific Holdings AXA.AX on Thursday, topping a rival bid led by insurer AMP Ltd ( AMP.AX ). 

 What are the possible outcomes of this potential bidding war, which involves selling AXA Asia Pacific's Asian operations to its parent, French insurer AXA SA ( AXAF.PA ), as it looks to double its exposure to booming markets like China and India. NAB BID SUCCEEDS Investors see this as the most likely outcome, especially since it has been backed by AXA Asia Pacific's independent directors. AXA Asia Pacific shares surged 12.7 percent to A$6.37, just below NAB's offer of A$6.43 a share in cash, on the view that AMP will not engage in a bidding war after having sweetened its joint offer with AXA SA this week. "The AXA share price is saying this deal will go through," said Hugh Giddy, Managing Director of Cannae Capital Partners, which owns NAB shares. AMP TRUMPS NAB AND WINS Investors put low odds on AMP coming up with a higher bid as it was unlikely to be able to match NAB's all-cash offer, which was more appealing to investors. AMP itself said its revised cash and scrip offer on Monday was "best and final." "It's going to come down to how far AMP can stretch their synergy goal," said Mark Nathan, a portfolio manager at Fortis Investment Partners, which owns NAB shares. It would be hard for AMP to justify a higher bid, given that its estimate on the savings from merging with AXA Asia Pacific was A$120 million a year, well below the A$210 million a year that NAB estimated. "I just hope our businessmen are not so stupid, for ego reasons, to outbid each other. They've got to make the numbers work. AXA not long ago was A$3.50," Giddy said. NAB'S BID IS BLOCKED BY AUSTRALIA'S COMPETITION WATCHDOG NAB could run into trouble with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission in its bid for AXA's Australian and New Zealand operations, as the watchdog and the government think the big four banks in Australia are already too big. The competition regulator would rather see AMP and AXA get together to create a "fifth pillar," a strong non-bank financial institution, than allow NAB to take over AXA, some fund managers said. However the government's ongoing review of the wealth management industry, dubbed the Cooper review, looking to drive fees down and improve returns on Australians' savings, favors large-scale managers. That would lead the regulator to let NAB buy AXA. "The Cooper Review says scale is better for investors," said a fund manager, who declined to be named. AXA SA ABANDONS PLAN TO BUY ASIAN OPERATIONS AXA SA is locked into an exclusivity agreement to back AMP's bid until February 6. If the battle for AXA Asia Pacific is a prolonged one, could it get impatient and walk away? That's unlikely, considering AXA SA tried unsuccessfully to grab AXA Asia Pacific twice five years ago. "Don't forget that AXA SA is very keen to get hold of our Asian assets," AXA Asia Pacific Chairman Rick Allert told reporters. (Reporting by  Sonali Paul ; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)
