 DUBAI  (Reuters) - Dubai's ruler on Thursday issued a law ordering government departments to transfer surplus revenues to the emirate's treasury and requires better control of public spending and transparency. Dubai received a $10 billion bailout from neighboring Abu Dhabi this week to help meet debt obligations of its flagship company Dubai World DBWLD.UL. The decree from Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum aims to regulate government departments' public spending "and control government revenues (and) provide an accurate database for revenues and expenditures."
