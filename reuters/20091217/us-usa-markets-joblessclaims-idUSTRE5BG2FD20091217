 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The number of U.S. workers filing new applications for jobless insurance unexpectedly rose last week, bumped up by seasonal adjustments, according to government data on Thursday that still suggested the labor market was improving. 

 KEY POINTS: * Initial claims for state unemployment benefits climbed 7,000 to a seasonally adjusted 480,000 in the week ended December 12 from a slightly downwardly revised 473,000 in the prior week, the Labor Department said. * It was the second straight week initial claims rose. * Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast claims falling to 465,000 from a previously reported 474,000. * The four-week moving average for new claims fell 5,250 to 467,500 last week, the lowest level since September 2008, and dropping for the 15th week in a row. * According to analysts, the four-week moving average needs to drop below 450,000 to indicate labor market stability. * The number of workers still collecting benefits after an initial week of aid rose 5,000 to 5.19 million in the week ended December 5. This was above market expectations for 5.15 million. * The insured unemployment rate, which measures the percentage of the insured labor force that is jobless, was unchanged at 3.9 percent in the week ended December 5. COMMENTS: DENNIS CAJIGAS, SENIOR MARKET STRATEGIST, LIND-WALDOCK, CHICAGO: "The numbers were essentially what I was expecting. It wasn't a big surprise. Overall I suppose the numbers are roughly bearish, slightly, especially when combined with the market action overnight. "The only thing this could do is dampen the idea that interest rates could be raised down the line. If the unemployment rate remains weak, it could mean less of a chance of rates being raised." WAYNE KAUFMAN, CHIEF MARKET ANALYST, JOHN THOMAS FINANCIAL, NEW YORK: "It's probably a non-event, even though the revised number went up. The dollar going up will be more important for the markets today. "The main issue going on now is that the market is struggling to put up some good end-of-the-year numbers so that the year-end statements look good. There has been no increase in demand for stocks, and we're stuck on the key question of have we started to see liquidation or are money managers just trying to lock in their profits?" ZACH PANDL, ECONOMIST, NOMURA SECURITIES, NEW YORK: "Don't read too much into these numbers here. These are volatile data and these two weeks of flat readings, a slight increase, follow five weeks of very steady decline. "We still think the trend in initial jobless claims is heading lower... A very typical pattern for these data is for a moderate retreat after sharp declines. We think that's all we're seeing here. "At this point our initial guess is that we'll have a positive payroll reading (showing) positive employment growth for the first time when the current month is reported in January. So undeterred by this small negative surprise." VASSILI SEREBRIAKOV, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO, NEW YORK: "The headline number is weaker than expected but the 4-week moving average continues to improve. We did see the dollar pare gains against the yen, but it's very minor. I don't think the impact would last that long. Overall, the labor market is recovering, although the last two jobless claims numbers suggest that the pace is still fairly gradual." JAMIE COX, MANAGING PARTNER, HARRIS FINANCIAL GROUP, COLONIAL HEIGHTS, VIRGINIA: "That's a pretty big move to the upside in claims for this one period. That's not good news and indicates things are still tough out there in the labor market. The Fed's decision to stand pat yesterday and keep rates low for an extended period was a good one." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stock index futures hold losses after unexpected rise in jobless claims. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices extend gains. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar pares gains slightly versus yen.
