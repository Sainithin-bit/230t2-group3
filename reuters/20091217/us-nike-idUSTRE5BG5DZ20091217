 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Nike Inc ( NKE.N ) reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings on Thursday as cost-cutting and a steadier order book helped offset weak sales in mature markets, and its shares rose more than 3 percent. 

 Nike has countered declines in consumer spending mainly by cutting costs, streamlining operations and reducing marketing. It has slashed 5 percent of its global workforce, or some 1,750 jobs. Orders for goods to be delivered from now until April fell 1 percent on a constant currency basis. That was better than some analysts had expected and an improvement from a 4 percent decline in the first quarter. A sampling of analysts had forecast a range of flat to down 6 percent in the second quarter for the key gauge known as futures orders. Second-quarter net income fell 4 percent to $375 million, or 76 cents per share, from $391 million, or 80 cents per share, a year earlier. That was better than analysts' average forecast of earnings of 71 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue slipped 4 percent to $4.4 billion, with sales down in every geographical area except for Nike's emerging markets. Revenue slid 4 percent in North America, 6 percent in Western Europe and 24 percent in Central and Eastern Europe. In China, a market with double-digit growth last year, sales fell 3 percent. Revenues were up 1 percent in the historically fast-growing unit that sells non-Nike-branded goods. Gross margins fell to 44.5 percent from 44.7 percent in the year-ago quarter, caused by higher discounting and foreign exchange impacts. Nike sales have been under pressure in recent quarters as consumers in the United States and Europe have spent conservatively and mall-based retailers have cut back on orders and carry less inventory. The Beaverton, Oregon-based company's shares rose 3.3 percent to $65.33 after closing at $63.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.
