 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - National Australia Bank ( NAB.AX ) made a surprise trump bid for AXA Asia Pacific Holdings' AXA.AX Australian and New Zealand units on Thursday, in a cash deal that would value all of the target firm at around $12 billion. 

 The bid tops an offer from Australian life insurer AMP Ltd ( AMP.AX ), which had faced resistance from AXA Asia Pacific's independent directors who were looking for a higher offer. NAB's move would consolidate its position as Australia's top wealth manager, after its purchase of British insurer Aviva's ( AV.L ) Australian operations earlier this year. NAB's bid came as AXA Asia Pacific weighed a sweetened takeover bid from Australia's AMP Ltd ( AMP.AX ) and French parent AXA SA ( AXAF.PA ), lobbed on Monday. That offer was worth $11.4 billion, or A$6.13 a share, based on AMP's close on Wednesday. NAB said its proposal, conditional on support from AXA SA ( AXAF.PA ), would involve NAB first making an offer for all of AXA Asia Pacific, worth $11.98 billion in cash, and then on-selling the firm's Asian assets to AXA. The proposal deliver Axa Asia-Pacific shareholders either A$6.43 cash per share or an alternative offer of A$1.59 cash and 0.1745 of a NAB share. Under AMP's plan, AMP would also have bought the entire company and then on-sold the Asian assets to AXA SA. Australia's biggest bank said its offer valued AXA's Australian and New Zealand arm at A$4.6 billion ($4.2 billion), compared with AMP's offer which as of Monday valued the same businesses at A$3.7 billion.
