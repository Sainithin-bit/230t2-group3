 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - General Mills Inc ( GIS.N ) posted a 50 percent increase in quarterly profit and raised its full-year forecast, helped by strong sales of higher-margin products like Cheerios and Fiber One cereals. 

 Shares of the company rose nearly 1 percent as General Mills managed to beat Wall Street profit expectations even after raising its advertising spending by 37 percent. "While a beat and (a forecast) raise may have been expected, we're impressed by the solid organic top line and sharp increase in the investment for future growth," J.P. Morgan analyst Terry Bivens said in a note to clients. General Mills, like most food companies, has benefited from cost-cutting and easing commodities costs, while its sales have been boosted as consumers eat more meals at home to save money. The maker of Cheerios cereal, Progresso soup and Yoplait yogurt said profit rose to $565.5 million, or $1.66 a share, in the fiscal second quarter ended November 29, from $378.2 million, or $1.09 a share, a year earlier. Excluding a gain from commodity hedges, earnings were $1.54 a share. Analysts on average forecast $1.45, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales rose 1.7 percent to $4.08 billion as a 4 percent increase in the U.S. retail segment, the company's largest business, helped offset a 16 percent decline in the bakeries and food service unit. Volume rose 2 percent in the U.S. retail business at a time when some companies have seen that measure of products shipped fall amid pressure from lower-priced competitors. Sales of "Big G" label cereal, which includes Fiber One, Chex and Cheerios, rose 10 percent. Gross margin rose to 41.2 percent in the quarter from 37.1 percent a year earlier, excluding changes in the market value of commodity positions. The company forecast fiscal 2010 earnings of $4.52 to $4.57 a share excluding items. In September it had forecast $4.40 to $4.45 per share. General Mills shares traded at $68.66 in premarket electronic trading, up from Wednesday's close of $68.29 on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock is up about 12 percent this year, compared with a 20 percent increase for rival Kellogg Co ( K.N ). (Reporting by Brad Dorfman; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn, John Wallace, Dave Zimmerman)
