 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Amgen Inc ( AMGN.O ) reported higher fourth-quarter profit on Monday as increased sales of its rheumatoid arthritis drug and white blood cell boosters helped offset larger-than-expected declines in its once top-selling anemia treatment. 

 Worldwide sales of Aranesp, which boosts red blood cell production in anemic chemotherapy patients, fell 15 percent to $706 million. Even with diminished expectations due to safety concerns and reimbursement restrictions, analysts were looking for $754 million in Aranesp sales after a surprisingly strong third quarter, and Amgen shares fell 1.6 percent. The world's largest biotechnology company posted a net profit of $961 million, or 91 per share, compared with a profit of $835 million, or 76 cents per share, a year ago. Excluding items Amgen earned $1.06 per share, topping analysts' average expectations by a penny, according to Reuters Estimates. Amgen said it expects 2009 earnings, excluding items, of $4.55 to $4.75 per share on revenue of $14.8 billion to $15.2 billion. Wall Street is looking for earnings of $4.68 per share and revenue of $15.43 billion. (Reporting by  Bill Berkrot )
