 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oil prices slipped 1.6 percent on Monday as dealers anticipated a government report would show another increase in swelling U.S. crude inventories as an economic slowdown hits fuel consumption. 

 The losses were tempered by evidence OPEC was complying with the bulk of its output cut agreements as the cartel struggles to stabilize a market that has dropped more than $100 since July's peak. U.S. crude fell 74 cents to settle at $45.73 a barrel, after rising to a session high of $48.59. London Brent dipped $1.41, to $46.96 a barrel. Energy analysts expect the U.S. Energy Information Administration's weekly report on petroleum inventories to show the fifth straight increase in crude stockpiles as weak demand and robust imports pad storage. The EIA report is due Wednesday. "Crude supplies will likely show another sizable stocks build as imports could rebound by more than 500,000 barrels per day in view of overseas supply availability ... and another decline in refinery activity," said Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch & Associates in Galena, Illinois. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has agreed to cut some 4.2 million barrels of daily output since September, but questions remain about whether the cuts will be enough to offset shrinking demand. Oil prices had risen earlier in the day, supported by gains in equity markets after a report showed the pace of sales of existing homes in the United States rose a surprising 6.5 percent in December. Economists pointed to the soured U.S. housing sector as the source of the global financial crisis that has put the world economy on the brink of recession. The International Monetary Fund cut its forecasts for 2009 global economic growth to 0.5 percent from 2.2 percent in its previous outlook issued in November. U.S. President Barack Obama believes that oil and other energy prices are not likely to stay cheap for long, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said on Monday. "The president believes that the price of oil and the price of energy is not likely to stay at the level it is now," he told a briefing.
