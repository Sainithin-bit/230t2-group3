 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Walgreen Co's ( WAG.N ) incoming chief executive officer may not be the face some investors expected to see at the helm, but Greg Wasson is ready to prove he can shepherd the drugstore chain through a long recession. 

 After interviewing internal and external candidates, Walgreen gave the job to Wasson, who has been with the company since 1980 and is now president and chief operating officer. Walgreen is just a few months into a plan to cut costs, trim store openings and revamp its stores. Wasson's task is to steer Walgreen in a new direction while consumers cut back on everything from medications to snacks during the recession. Walgreen met with "two to three key leading economists" a couple of months ago to look at best case and worst case scenarios for a U.S. economic recovery, Wasson told Reuters. "All our work has led us to believe that it looks likely to be the middle of 2010 before we think we may be able to begin to see an uptick," Wasson said in an interview. "Frankly, it seems like every week or two that goes by there's somebody out there that's got a little bit more of a negative forecast." Walgreen, like other retailers, is focused on selling essential items such as food and promoting its own, less expensive, products as shoppers hunt for deals. "I'm looking forward to understanding more about the president's stimulus package and how it will take shape," Wasson said of Barack Obama. "But I absolutely am concerned with the consumer engagement that we are seeing today. And that we have got to get the consumer back involved if we are going to turn this economy around." Like Walgreen's previous CEOs, Wasson was initially a pharmacist at the Deerfield, Illinois-based chain. He has been leading initiatives such as the plan to cut 1,000 jobs for the past few months. Starting February 1 he will be president and CEO. For now, the COO post will go unfilled. The company he takes over is a bit different than a traditional drug store chain, as it runs health care clinics, does drug infusions in patients' homes and offers lower cost drugs for 1.5 million consumers through a savings card. "I'm bullish on the industry, I think there's a lot of opportunity to really play a big part in health care reform." Wasson does not appear to favor the route competitor CVS Caremark ( CVS.N ) took as a major pharmacy benefits manager. "We are a retailer at core," he said. "I think we're well positioned to play a greater role in offering consumer health and wellness services but I don't think you'll see us become a 'health care' company." Asked if Walgreen would acquire a big PBM, Wasson quickly replied "No. I don't think our strategy is going to change." However, Walgreen will promote more services and programs such as its prescription savings card and clinics, especially now that Obama is in the White House. "With the new administration's position on trying to expand health care services to the uninsured, we think we are well positioned as a provider to help with the access issue." Walgreen still aims to return to double digit earnings per share growth, though Wasson would not say when. "I think just as soon as we possibly can ... but I'm not going to put myself in a position where I'm going to say it will be tomorrow, or it will be next year." While Walgreen has become more open with investors in recent months, including hosting quarterly conference calls, one thing will remain the same under Wasson's tenure. "Certainly we don't give guidance and don't intend to give guidance, but we certainly want to be as transparent as we can and really try to articulate our strategy and give updates on performance. I think that is a big part of our future going forward and one which I am going to enjoy." (Editing by Phil Berlowitz)
