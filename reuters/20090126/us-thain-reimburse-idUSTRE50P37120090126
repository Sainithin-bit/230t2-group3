 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Former Merrill Lynch Chief Executive John Thain defended the acquisition of the brokerage by Bank of America Corp and said the bank knew of Merrill's losses and bonuses before the merger closed. 

 In a memo to Merrill employees, Thain also said he plans to reimburse Bank of America for a $1.2 million renovation of his office a year ago, calling the cost "a mistake in light of the world we live in today." The renovation expenses, including reports of a trash can that cost $1,405, became a symbol of corporate greed and waste. Thain's insistence that Bank of America was well aware of Merrill's financial condition raises pressure on Bank of America Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis. Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America this month took $20 billion of new capital from the U.S. government to cover Merrill losses. Lewis faces shareholder anger and several lawsuits for failing in December to disclose Merrill's losses and talks with the U.S. Treasury Department. The merger closed on January 1. Through Friday, Bank of America shares had fallen 82 percent since the merger was announced Sept 15. Bank of America said Merrill lost $15.31 billion in the fourth quarter. Thain's memo was posted by CNBC television on its website, four days after Lewis ousted Thain as head of global banking, securities and wealth management. Calls to Merrill and Bank of America for comment were not immediately returned. In the memo, Thain said Merrill's 2008 discretionary bonus pool was 41 percent lower than in 2007. He also said the size of the pool, the mix of cash and stock used, and the timing of payments "were all determined together with Bank of America." The bonus pool was about $4 billion, according to published reports. Thain also said Merrill's quarterly losses were "very large and unfortunate" but stemmed almost entirely from the reign of his predecessor, Stanley O'Neal, who was ousted in October 2007. Thain said "we were completely transparent with Bank of America." "They learned about these losses when we did," he wrote. Lewis this month expressed public surprise and dismay at Merrill's losses. Merrill awarded bonuses in December, rather than wait until after the new year as in had in the past. Bank of America shares rose 52 cents to $6.76 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
