 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc posted a lower net profit on Monday, as its fourth-quarter results were hurt by a higher tax rate, charges related to cost reduction initiatives and settlement costs from an investigation by U.S. authorities. 

 The world's biggest drugmaker said it earned $266 million, or 4 cents per share, compared with $2.72 billion, or 40 cents per share, in the year-earlier period. Excluding special items, Pfizer earned 65 cents per share, up from 50 cents a share, a year earlier. Quarterly revenue fell 4 percent to $12.35 billion. The company forecast 2009 earnings of $1.85 to $1.95 a share, on revenues of $44 billion to $46 billion. Analysts, on average, have forecast 2009 earnings of $2.50 a share, on revenues of $48.7 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. (Reporting by  Euan Rocha  and Ransdell Pierson)
