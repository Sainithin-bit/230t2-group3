 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc, the No. 1 drugmaker, said on Monday that it would acquire U.S. rival Wyeth for about $68 billion in a move to diversify its revenue base. 

 The world's largest drugmaker, which raised $22.5 billion in debt from a consortium of banks to finance the deal, also cut its dividend. The following is reaction from industry analysts and investors: SEAMUS FERNANDEZ, ANALYST, LEERINK SWANN IN BOSTON "With Pfizer ideally suited to buy Wyeth in the current environment, we believe additional suitors are unlikely to emerge." "Although several companies may have the capability to execute a mega-merger in the current environment (JNJ, ABT, GSK, SNY), we believe that Pfizer is ideally suited to execute the deal due to limited overlap in its businesses and what we perceive to be reasonably aligned corporate cultures. We believe that Pfizer is best-positioned to deliver on the financing necessary to close the deal in the current environment." MICHAEL CASTOR, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, SIO CAPITAL MANAGEMENT IN NEW YORK "An acquisition of this nature can be valuable if management recognizes how rich their spending is and really cuts to maximize the profitability of the new organization. $4 billion in cuts a good first step. There's a lot of potential to go deeper across the combined organization." "With the cost cuts that they've articulated, it's an OK deal, it's not destructive. But they could really make it into a good deal if they cut deeper, and I think there's the potential to do so." LES FUNTLEYDER, HEALTHCARE ANALYST, MILLER TABAK IN NEW YORK "Big mergers tend not to be value creators historically, maybe with the exception of Pfizer's Warner-Lambert deal to get Lipitor, and that is still is even an open question." "The odds do not favor necessarily the big merger working, but they had to do something. They had to buy time for their R&D units to kick out new drugs." "I think the market will be glad that Pfizer is actually doing something. I do question the financing." PETER BOOCKVAR, EQUITY STRATEGIST AT MILLER TABAK & CO IN NEW YORK "Obviously those companies that are cash rich can afford to pay something like this. Pfizer has a major issue with Lipitor going generic in a couple years so they have a major pipeline that they have to fill. They're cash rich so a combination of that has them in the market. I wouldn't extrapolate this deal and say we're going to see a lot more deals because it's still a difficult financing environment. Pfizer has a top tier balance sheet and they can handle something like this." ANDRE BAKHOS, PRESIDENT PRINCETON FINANCIAL GROUP, NEW BRUNSWICK, NEW JERSEY: "Deals of this quality and this magnitude will rekindle enthusiasm and hope about equity markets. "In the midst of a global recession, here is Pfizer, hopefully spending their dollar's wisely." (Reporting by  Ellis Mnyandu ,  Leah Schnurr  and  Lewis Krauskopf )
