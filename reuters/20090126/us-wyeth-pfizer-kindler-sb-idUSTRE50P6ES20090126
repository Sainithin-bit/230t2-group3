 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc will be able to prosper and grow after merging with Wyeth, despite skepticism by some critics that a drugmaker that large can prosper, Pfizer Chief Executive Jeff Kindler said on Monday. 

 Pfizer, with annual sales of about $48 billion, would obtain an array of Wyeth prescription drugs, consumer products and animal health brands with annual sales of almost $23 billion. Kindler, in an interview, said he disagreed with one analyst prediction that it would be "nearly impossible" for Pfizer to generate revenue growth from such a large combined new revenue base. "What that kind of thinking might miss is the very different way we've organized our company and run the company" in the past two years, said Kindler, who took the helm of Pfizer in July 2006. Pfizer has discovered very few big drugs over the past decade, despite buoyant optimism about important future drugs after buying Warner-Lambert Co in 2000 for $89 billion and scooping up Pharmacia Corp for $61 billion. But Kindler predicted drugs will flow impressively again from its laboratories and bolster results of the combined Pfizer and Wyeth, thanks to recent changes that have narrowed Pfizer's focus to fewer disease areas and divided its operations into six independent business units. "We've moved away from a centralized, monolithic one-size fits all approach," Kindler said, by creating separate units for primary care medicines, specialty medicines, oncology, established products (mature drugs and generics), emerging markets and animal health. "Each of these is led, effectively, by their own CEO, with clear accountability and the ability to move their business to seize revenue opportunities quickly and within the best cost base for their organization," Kindler said. Kindler, who would remain CEO after Wyeth is acquired, said a consumer products business unit will now also be created at Pfizer. It would include Wyeth's many consumer brands, including Advil painkiller, ChapStick and Centrum vitamins. He expressed admiration that Johnson & Johnson, a diversified healthcare company with annual revenue of $60 billion, has been able to generate consistently strong results over the years. "I admire greatly what they've done and like their business model; it is very similar to what we're describing," he said. Kinder earlier on Monday told journalists a handful of banks that are lending Pfizer $22.5 billion to help finance the Wyeth purchase were helping "advance the American economy." Asked if feared big jobs cuts after the planned Wyeth acquisition would instead hurt the economy, Kindler said, "You can't have good well-paying jobs without healthy American companies that are in a position to create those jobs. "Our obligation is to our shareholders, which requires us to run our company as effectively and efficiently as we can do, and that's what we intend to do."
