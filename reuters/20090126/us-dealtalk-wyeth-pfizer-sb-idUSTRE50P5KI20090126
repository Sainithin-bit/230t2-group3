 PHILADELPHIA  (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc's $68 billion deal to buy Wyeth may spark more deals in the healthcare sector, but it is unlikely to revive the flailing merger market. 

 Pfizer secured $22.5 billion in funding from a consortium of banks to help pay for the deal, a major feat at a time when credit markets remain tight. With the U.S. recession and swooning global financial markets, the volume of mergers worldwide dropped 30 percent last year, according to data from Thomson Reuters. "If you're going to loan money, you're going to take a risk on the Pfizers of the world," said Richard Scheff, vice chairman of Montgomery McCracken. "Not withstanding the lower profits, Pfizer is a very strong company with a lot of cash socked away. The banks have been criticized for making bad loans in the past, so you can't fault them for making a seemingly safer bet," Scheff said. Of course, not every would-be suitor has Pfizer's strong credit rating, hefty cash flow and marquee name. In a sign of how fragile the deals market remains, Dow Chemical Co said on Monday it will not close the acquisition of rival Rohm and Haas Co by January 27, breaking a key condition of the merger pact and sparking speculation the deal might collapse. Rohm & Haas sued Dow Chemical in Delaware Chancery Court on Monday to try to enforce the deal. Pfizer's ability to get funding may initially seem like a good omen for other suitors looking to do deals, but each deal is competing against every other transaction being shopped around to banks, investment bankers said. Roche Holding AG, for example, is looking for funding as it aims to raise its bid for the 44 percent of Genentech Inc it does not already own, sources previously told Reuters. Last year, the Swiss drugmaker offered $43.7 billion, or $89 per share, to acquire the stake. Bankers have said  Roche is now waiting for the right moment to tap the difficult, expensive and illiquid credit markets before raising its bid. "Though there do seem to be banks willing to lend and the corporate debt market appears to be receptive to deals of this sort, the issues faced by Roche in its attempt to get financing to purchase Genentech ... should give some investors at least some pause," Les Funtleyder, analyst with Miller Tabak & Co. Still, the Pfizer deal may spur M&A activity in pharmaceuticals and healthcare, as rivals respond to the Pfizer-Wyeth behemoth and the financing package could be a good sign for other cash-rich sectors looking to merge, said one lawyer who specializes in mergers and acquisitions. MERGERS OF WEAKNESS "Deals will be tough and bloody," said one merger lawyer. Another M&A lawyer said job cuts would be the end game for many transactions. "It's all about either surviving or coming out of this as a dominant player in their sector," the lawyer. Pfizer bought Wyeth in a move to diversify its revenue stream ahead of its key Lipitor cholesterol drug facing U.S. generic competition in 2011. In announcing the Wyeth deal, Pfizer said it would halve its dividend to help fund the acquisition and would cut 15 percent of the combined company's workforce of about 130,000 employees. Together, the combined companies will save about $4 billion as they consolidate overlapping operations. PROPER USE OF TARP FUNDS? The fact that Pfizer was advised by and received funding from some banks that got billions of taxpayer dollars from the TARP (Troubled Asset Relief Program) also raised questions among some analysts. That is a sign of the scrutiny banks will face going forward as they finance deals, oversight that could also serve as a deterrent to similar transactions going forward. "We also wonder whether some of the banks who appear to have taken money under the TARP will than turn around and loan that money to finance a deal that will obviously -- to us -- lead to job losses -- something we assume the authors of the legislation would be vehemently against." said Funtleyder. Scheff agreed, saying that, although the combination of Pfizer and Wyeth may be beneficial for the healthcare sector and economy over the long-term, the short-term effects may raise criticism. "If you listen to everything the government has said about trying to get money back into the economy and help small businesses survive and expand -- at the end of this day this deal isn't going to put people back to work soon. This can't be what government intended," Scheff said. Pfizer's Chief Executive Officer Jeff Kindler, however, took a different view. "It's good to see banks doing what they're supposed to be doing to lend money to advance the American economy," he said at a news conference. "Pfizer is a U.S. company that creates high paying good jobs for Americans." (Additional reporting by  Lewis Krauskopf  and  Megan Davies  in New York; Editing by  Andre Grenon )
