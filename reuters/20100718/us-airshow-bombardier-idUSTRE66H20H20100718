 FARNBOROUGH, England  (Reuters) - Canada's Bombardier ( BBDb.TO ) is likely to announce at least one order for its new C-Series plane at the Farnborough Airshow this week, a source familiar with the project told Reuters on Sunday. 

 The move could put pressure on Boeing ( BA.N ) and Airbus ( EAD.PA ) to upgrade their own narrow-body airplanes, the source said, asking not to be identified. "There is serious interest in the airplane," said the source, who has direct knowledge of the program. There has been speculation that airlines such as Qatar Airways may place an order for the new 110-130 seat Bombardier jet, which aims to compete with Airbus and Boeing at the lower end of their 110-185 seat short- and medium-haul passenger jets. "We are talking to many customers about C-Series. We are in no position to confirm any new orders for C-Series ... simply because it hasn't happened," said John Arnone, a spokesman for Bombardier Commercial Airplanes. Qatar Airways has called a news conference immediately after Bombardier on Monday, but has not disclosed the subject. The airline is also an active buyer of other aircraft. Asked if Bombardier could make any big announcements at the biennial air show this week, the source said, "That is certainly a strong possibility." Bombardier has secured orders for 90 of the C-Series planes, which sell for around $50 million to $77 million at list prices, as well as 90 options. Arnone added Bombardier has more than 60 active "campaigns," or ongoing talks with potential customers. (Reporting by  Andrea Shalal-Esa  and Kyle Peterson, Editing by Maureen Bavdek)
