 (Reuters) - Hedge fund TPG-Axon said on Sunday that a Friday court ruling barring the board of SandRidge Energy Inc ( SD.N ) from resisting its campaign to replace the energy firm's board shows precisely why the change is needed. 
 During TPG-Axon's efforts to seek shareholder solicitations to replace SandRidge's directors, they "acted in a manner to entrench themselves and prevent a fair process from playing out," the hedge fund said. Friday's ruling by a Delaware judge, which prevents SandRidge from seeking to revoke those shareholder consents or rely on any revocations it had received, further demonstrates why the directors must replaced, TPG-Axon said, noting that the board has "shown disregard" for stockholders. TPG-Axon, which owns 7.3 percent of SandRidge, said shareholders that support its slate should submit their consents before March 13. A spokesman for SandRidge was not immediately available to comment on Sunday outside of regular business hours. (Reporting By  Martinne Geller  in New York; editing by Sofina Mirza-Reid)
