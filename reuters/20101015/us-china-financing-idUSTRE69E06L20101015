 SHANGHAI  (Reuters) - Chinese firms from nine key industries, including steel and cement manufacturers, will need to consult the National Development and Reform Commission should they plan to seek more financing, local media said on Friday. 

 Property firms seeking financing will also need to "solicit the opinion" of the Ministry of Land and Resources, the China Securities Journal reported. Citing unnamed sources familiar with the plan, the nine industries to be affected by the new regulation include steel, cement, coal processing, aluminum, shipbuilding, glass, wind power equipment, polysilicon and steel forging. The move is the latest in a series of measures the Chinese government has taken to restrict liquidity and cool its fast-growing economy. Firms that hold a sizeable stake in property developers will also need to seek the views of the Ministry of Land and Resources should they plan to raise cash, the paper said.
