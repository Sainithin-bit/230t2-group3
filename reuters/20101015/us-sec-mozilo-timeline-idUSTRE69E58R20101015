 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Angelo Mozilo and two other former top executives at Countrywide Financial Corp, now a part of Bank of America Corp, agreed to settle regulatory charges on Friday, a federal judge said. 

 The Securities and Exchange Commission had accused the three of hiding the risks that the company's mortgage portfolio posed to investors. Mozilo was also accused of insider trading. None of the three defendants admitted any wrongdoing in settling the case, the judge said. Here is a timeline of the Countrywide case: October 26, 2007 -- Mozilo says on a company conference call that the SEC opened an informal inquiry into his sales of Countrywide stock which resulted in more than $100 million in gains. He says he did not engage in any trading decisions based on material non-public information. January 2008 -- Bank of America announces a deal to buy Countrywide for $4 billion in stock, a fraction of what the company was worth when the housing market was booming. Mozilo says he will forfeit $37.5 million in severance and other pay upon his retirement. July 2008 - Bank of America's takeover of Countrywide closes. The final merger value fell to about $2.5 billion as Bank of America share prices had dropped. April 2009 -- The Countrywide name disappears from Bank of America's mortgage operations. June 4, 2009 -- The SEC brings civil fraud charges against Mozilo, former Countrywide President David Sambol and ex-Chief Financial Officer Eric Sieracki. February 26, 2010 -- Mozilo hires prominent lawyer Brendan Sullivan to help him defend against the SEC charges. May 7, 2010 -- Countrywide agrees to a $600 million settlement of a lawsuit accusing it of misleading investors about its lending practices. Its former auditor, KPMG LLP, agrees to pay $24 million to resolve the litigation. June 7, 2010 -- Bank of America agrees to pay $108 million to settle Federal Trade Commission charges that Countrywide bilked borrowers with misleading and excessive fees. September 17, 2010 -- The SEC receives the go-ahead from U.S. District Judge John Walter to take Mozilo and the other two defendants to trial. October 15, 2010 -- Mozilo and the other two defendants reach a last-minute deal with the SEC before the start of their trial on October 19. Mozilo agrees to a $67.5 million settlement to resolve the case. (Reporting by Martha Graybow. Editing by Robert MacMillan)
