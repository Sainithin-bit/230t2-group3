 BOSTON  (Reuters) - U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke signaled the central bank is likely to ease monetary policy further in a bid to support a sluggish recovery and reduce a stubbornly high jobless rate, but gave no details on the next step. 

 Most economists surveyed by Reuters expect the Fed to embark on a new round of Treasury purchases as soon as November, buying as much as $500 billion. The following are some recent comments from Fed policymakers (* denotes 2010 voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets U.S. monetary policy): *FED CHAIRMAN BEN BERNANKE, October 15 "There would appear -- all else being equal -- to be a case for further action." ATLANTA FED PRESIDENT DENNIS LOCKHART, October 15 "We've slowed down pretty dramatically. Inflation is running too low. It is too close conceivably to the kind of tipping point into a deflationary environment." MINNEAPOLIS FED PRESIDENT NARAYANA KOCHERLAKOTA, October 14 "My own guess is that further uses of QE would have a more muted effect on Treasury term premia" than the first round in early 2009, because markets are functioning much better now. * BOSTON FED PRESIDENT ERIC ROSENGREN, October 14 Japan "also did quantitative easing, but they did it very gradually," Rosengren told CNBC television. "What this highlights is we may not want to do it nearly as gradually." "It's a low-probability event that we have deflation, but we don't even want disinflation." RICHMOND FED PRESIDENT JEFFREY LACKER, October 13 "I said several weeks ago that I thought if the economic growth and inflation numbers came in the way I was expecting them to, I'd probably not support more easing ... I'm kind of in the same place." MINUTES OF SEPT. 21 FOMC MEETING, released October 12 "Members generally thought that the statement should note that the committee was prepared to provide additional accommodation if needed to support the economic recovery and to return inflation, over time, to levels consistent with its mandate. "Such an indication accorded with the members' sense that such accommodation may be appropriate before long, but also made clear that any decisions would depend upon future information about the economic situation and outlook." * KANSAS CITY FED PRESIDENT THOMAS HOENIG, October 12 "We have to recognize that QE2, while a possibility, is not necessarily what we want to do given the benefits versus the risks. * FED VICE CHAIR JANET YELLEN, October 11 "It is conceivable that accommodative monetary policy could provide tinder for a buildup of leverage and excessive risk-taking in the financial system." * NEW YORK FED PRESIDENT WILLIAM DUDLEY, October 10 "I would expect that as time passes, we will see further improvement in credit availability, and as that happens that will help support economic activity." * ST. LOUIS FED PRESIDENT JAMES BULLARD, October 8 "This upcoming FOMC meeting is going to be a tough call because the economy has slowed, but it hasn't slowed so much that it's an obvious case to do something," Bullard told CNBC. "I do think the risk of a double-dip recession has probably receded some in the last six to eight weeks." * KANSAS CITY FED PRESIDENT THOMAS HOENIG, October 7 "There is discussion in the media, and broadly speaking, even amongst Federal Reserve policy members that we need to increase our stimulus for monetary policy. Now, I happen to disagree with that." DALLAS FED PRESIDENT RICHARD FISHER, October 7 "I instinctively understand the impulse to put the monetary pedal to the metal to try to move the needle on employment growth ... And yet the efficacy of further accommodation at this point has yet to be established." CHICAGO FED PRESIDENT CHARLES EVANS, October 5 "In the last several months I've stared at our unemployment forecast and come to the conclusion that it's just not coming down nearly as quickly as it should," Evans told The Wall Street Journal. "This is a far grimmer forecast than we ought to have," he said, for which reason he favors "much more accommodation than we've put in place." * FED CHAIRMAN BEN BERNANKE, October 4 "I don't have a number to give you, but I do think that the additional purchases, although we don't have precise numbers, have the ability to ease financial conditions."
