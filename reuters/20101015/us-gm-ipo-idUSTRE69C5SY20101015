 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - General Motors Co GM.UL said on Friday that it had not yet determined a price range for its initial public offering and that it could not say if the IPO would take place in November as widely expected. 

 The unusual caution came in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in response to comments this week from Chairman and former Chief Executive Ed Whitacre. Whitacre told Reuters on the sidelines of a business event in San Antonio on Wednesday that GM shares would likely price between $20 and $25 in a November IPO. The comments on the pricing of GM stock appeared to violate the quiet period that the automaker has imposed to comply with U.S. securities regulations in advance of the IPO. Any comments beyond what is included in GM's regulatory filings could be construed as breaking SEC rules during the quiet period and could jeopardize the timing of the IPO, bankers and analysts have said. In its Friday filing with the SEC, GM said none of Whitacre's remarks from earlier in the week on the IPO reflected the position of the company. "A price range for the (IPO) has not yet been determined and will be disclosed only after it has been determined. In addition, the company cannot predict whether the offering will be priced in November," GM said. GM also said it could not say whether the IPO would succeed or whether it would take place in November. Whitacre said on Wednesday that investors would "buy the management of the company" in evaluating GM shares, but GM also refuted that assertion in its filing. "The company cannot predict the basis on which any potential investors would determine whether or not to invest," it said. The GM filing included an appendix with a copy of the Reuters interview with Whitacre from Wednesday. GM was restructured in 2009 with a $50 billion bailout from the U.S. government. The IPO is a step toward reducing the U.S. Treasury's nearly 61 percent stake in the automaker.
