 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Mattel Inc ( MAT.O ) missed quarterly sales estimates on an unexpected decline at its Fisher-Price preschool toy unit and its shares fell 7 percent. 

 Mattel has been trying to turn around Fisher-Price for several quarters, with its latest initiatives to revitalize the brand including the launch of Sing-A-Ma-Jigs, $13 plush toys that sing in harmony. Many analysts are optimistic about Sing-A-Ma-Jigs this holiday season, but some like Wedbush's Edward Woo worry that the toy company has still not done enough to turn around the core Fisher-Price business. The company "didn't get the lift in other toy sales that we thought we were going to get," Woo said, adding some of the weakness in Fisher-Price was also due to foreign currency effects. Sales at the Fisher-Price unit were $743.4 million, down 5 percent from the prior year as weakness in the Fisher-Price and Power Wheels brands more than offset sales gains in the unit's Thomas and Friends and Sing-A-Ma-Jigs brands. Woo, who expected a sales increase of 5 percent to 10 percent at Fisher-Price this quarter, said he preferred rival Hasbro's shares going into the holiday season, the busiest time of year for toy makers. Another damper to the business' turnaround efforts was a recall of about 10 million toys and other items in the United States and Canada due to the potential for serious injuries. Overall, Mattel's sales rose 2 percent to $1.83 billion, with increases of 3 percent domestically and 2 percent internationally. Sales fell short of the average Wall Street forecast of $1.94 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. COMPANY OPTIMISTIC DESPITE SALES MISS Mattel's profit in the quarter did come in a penny above analysts' estimates, helped by a tax benefit and sales of other brands like Barbie, Disney Princess and Monster High. Mattel, which competes with Hasbro Inc HAS.N and many private toy companies, said third-quarter net income rose to $283.3 million, or 77 cents a share, from $229.8 million, or 63 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting a profit of 76 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Barbie sales were up 6 percent, while demand for other key brands like Hot Wheels and Fisher-Price fell considerably. Some Mattel holiday products, including its Hot Wheels' Stealth Rides vehicles, Monster High line and plush Sing-A-Ma-Jig harmonizing dolls, have made it to many a top toy list this year. Monster High dolls, based on famous monster characters, are timed with the popularity of the "Twilight" movies and television shows like "The Vampire Diaries" and "True Blood," Jim Silver and Christopher Byrne, who compile the closely watched "Most Wanted" toy list, told Reuters last month.
