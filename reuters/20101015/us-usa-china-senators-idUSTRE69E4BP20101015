 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Two Democratic senators praised the Obama administration on Friday for launching a trade investigation into Chinese clean energy practices but criticized the delay in a decision on whether Beijing manipulates its currency. 

 "The Obama administration is treating the symptom but not the disease. An investigation into China's illegal subsidies for its clean energy industry is overdue but it's no substitute for dealing with China's currency manipulation," said Senator Charles Schumer. "Democrats and Republicans alike in Congress are prepared to move legislation confronting China's currency manipulation this year. We hope to have the administration's support but will go forward without it if necessary." Senator Debbie Stabenow voiced similar sentiments. (Reporting by  Doug Palmer )
