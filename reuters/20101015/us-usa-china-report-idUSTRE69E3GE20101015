 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department will release its semi-annual report on the currency practices of major U.S. trading partners at 1 p.m. (1700 GMT) on Friday, industry sources said. 

 The report presents the Obama administration with a difficult decision on whether to label China as a currency manipulator, a move many U.S. lawmakers say is overdue but one that could sour Sino-U.S. relations. (Reporting by  Rachelle Younglai  and  Doug Palmer )
