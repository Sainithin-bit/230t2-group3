 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Texas Instruments TXN.N has opened a Chinese semiconductor wafer factory with enough operating capacity to support more than $1 billion in annual revenue, the U.S. chip maker said on Thursday. 

 TI said the Chengdu factory, its first in China, would expand its analog chip production capacity. The factory, which TI bought from Cension Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, has an operating fabrication facility of 120,000 square feet and a 134,00 fab reserved for future production needs. The move follows manufacturing expansion by TI in the United States, Japan and Germany in the last two years. TI said the move would put manufacturing close to its growing customer base in China. The company is winding down its cellphone baseband chip business to instead put most of its focus on analog chips and embedded processors. (Reporting by  Sinead Carew ; Editing by  Anshuman Daga )
