 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Sales at U.S. retailers rose a stronger-than-expected 0.6 percent in September, lifted by big-ticket items including autos, electronics and appliances, Commerce Department figures showed on Friday. 

 Analysts polled by Reuters had expected an increase of 0.4 percent for September, after an upwardly revised 0.7 percent gain in August. Excluding autos, September sales were up 0.4 percent, matching analysts' expectations. The figures suggest consumption may have been a bit stronger than economists had anticipated in the third quarter. Consumer spending accounts for roughly 70 percent of the U.S. economy, so a strong reading bodes well for third-quarter gross domestic product. Sales at motor vehicles and parts dealers rose 1.6 percent last month. Electronics and appliances stores saw a 1.5 percent gain. With the exception of clothing and department stores, every other major retail category showed gains for the month. (Reporting by  Emily Kaiser , Editing by Neil Stempleman)
