 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A blowout quarter from Google sent the Nasdaq up over 1 percent on Friday, while uncertainty surrounding major banks' exposure to foreclosure losses dragged the Dow lower. 

 Google Inc's ( GOOG.O ) 11.2 percent surge -- on the largest volume in two years - made the Nasdaq the best performer among the three major U.S. stock indexes. General Electric's poor quarterly revenues underscored the economy's soft spots, and it was the Dow's biggest percentage loser with a 5.1 percent drop. With several major banks due to report earnings next week, investors are keen to see how deeply the foreclosure crisis has affected their stability. "To the extent the banks have less capital because they intended to foreclose on these homes, they'll be less able to lend and help the economy move forward," said Manny Weintraub, managing director at Integre Advisors in New York. "It also makes people nervous about financial products in general. It's just another headache in times when we don't need headaches." Among the banks that saw the biggest reductions in earnings estimates for the quarter in the latest week are Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ), PNC Financial Services Group ( PNC.N ) and Citigroup ( C.N ), according to John Butters, director of U.S. earnings at Thomson Reuters. Citi, which reports earnings on Monday, lost 2.7 percent to $3.95, while Bank of America ( BAC.N ) fell 4.9 percent to $11.98. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  dropped 31.79 points, or 0.29 percent, to 11,062.78. The Standard & Poor's 500  .SPX  gained 2.38 points, or 0.20 percent, to 1,176.19. The Nasdaq Composite  .IXIC  rose 33.39 points, or 1.37 percent, to 2,468.77. The S&P 500 hit a session high around 1,180 for a third straight day, a level that could become technical resistance moving forward. Also weakening technically, the KBW bank index .BKX fell 5.9 percent in the past three days and slipped below its 50-day moving average. For the week, the Dow rose 0.5 percent, the S&P 500 added 0.9 percent and the Nasdaq Composite gained 2.8 percent. FLYING APPLE, FALLING GE Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ) led gains in the Nasdaq 100 and shot up 4.4 percent to a new record high intraday at $315. At the close, Apple was up 4.1 percent at $314.74. Technology companies "have great balance sheets, they don't need financing, and have global customers," Weintraub said. "Tech has a lot more opportunity to benefit from global growth, which is stronger than U.S. growth." General Electric Co ( GE.N ) closed at $16.30, down 5.1 percent, after revenues came in below estimates, even as profits from continuing operations increased for the second straight quarter and its GE Capital unit recorded a stronger performance. Earlier on Friday, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke helped put a bid on equities after he said high unemployment and low inflation pointed to a need for further monetary easing. A flood of data, including a smaller-than-expected rise in consumer prices in September and a weaker-than-forecast reading of consumer sentiment in October, supported investors' hopes that the Fed will print more money. The S&P 500 is up 12.1 percent since September 1, partly on the expectation of further accommodative policies from the U.S. central bank. About 9.9 billion shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq, the highest since July 1, and above the year's volume average at near 8.78 billion. Declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a ratio of about 3 to 2. On the Nasdaq, the balance was just slightly tilted to the negative side despite the index's 1 percent gain for the day, with 1,340 issues falling and 1,253 shares rising.
