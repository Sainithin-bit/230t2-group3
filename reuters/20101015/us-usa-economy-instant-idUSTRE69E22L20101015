 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. consumer inflation rose slower than expected in September as energy prices rose at the slowest pace in three months, data released by the Labor Department showed on Friday. 

 Sales at U.S. retailers rose a stronger-than-expected 0.6 percent in September, lifted by big-ticket items including autos, electronics and appliances, Commerce Department figures showed. A gauge of manufacturing in New York State jumped in October, lifted by improvements in new orders and shipments, the New York Federal Reserve said in a report.
