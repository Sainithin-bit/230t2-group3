 NEW YORK/BOSTON  (Reuters) - General Electric Co's future credibility among long-term investors may hinge more on the largest U.S. conglomerate's ability to boost its dividend than finding new sources of growth. 

 The company lost income investors when it was forced to slash its dividend 68 percent during the worst recession in generations, analysts and investors said. It has since found that even a strong earnings performance is often not enough to lure back disaffected shareholders. Consider a simple fact: each time the huge engines-to-movies conglomerate has beaten Wall Street earnings forecasts this year -- something it has done thrice -- its shares have fallen. It happened again on Friday. But when GE raised its dividend 20 percent in late July, the stock rose 3.3 percent. "The dividend is indisputable in its credibility," said longtime GE analyst Nick Heymann of Sterne Agee, who said lifting the dividend may depend on GE retiring high-yielding preferred shares purchased by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc during the worst of the crisis. "Your last match in the survival kit is the dividend to move the stock," Heymann added. GE shareholders have endured three brutal years. As the financial crisis hammered the company's GE Capital arm and the recession dried up demand for heavy equipment, the shares plunged to 18-year lows in early 2009. They have since rebounded and have risen at twice the rate of the Dow Jones Industrial average through 2010, even with Friday's 5 percent slide down to $16.31. But they are less than half the $40.50 they traded at before Chief Executive Jeff Immelt took over in September 2001. ROOM TO GROW? July's 20 percent increase brought the quarterly payout to 12 cents per share, leaving it well below the 31 cent quarterly rate in place before the recession. At a 2.8 percent yield, GE's payout is better than most of its industrial peers and higher than the yield of the Standard & Poor's 500 index. U.S. manufacturing companies, whose earnings and cash flows have bounced back with a recovery in industrial demand, have started to return some cash to shareholders. Timken Co, Crane Co, Caterpillar Inc and Parker-Hannifin Corp have boosted dividends this year. Ingersoll-Rand Plc, which is focused on paying down debt, may do so next year. GE officials plan to keep raising the payout in line with earnings. Chief Financial Officer Keith Sherin said on Friday the company aims to pay out 40 percent to 45 percent of earnings to shareholders in a dividend. The new 48 cents annual rate represents 38.7 percent of forecast 2011 earnings and GE said on Friday it expects profit to rise again in 2012. But Sherin talked down investor hopes that GE's board would start evaluating the dividend frequently. "It hasn't been something that we have traditionally reviewed every quarter," he said in an interview. "Normally, we reviewed it in the December board meeting for the following year's increase. Many investors turned their back on the company as a result, said Jack De Gan, Chief Investment Officer of Harbor Advisory Corp, which holds GE shares. "They need to bring back the constituency of investors who were income investors," De Gan said. "That was a big part of GE's appeal before the crisis. It was a 'widows-and-orphans' stock that a lot of people owned for the dividend." (Reporting by Nick Zieminski; editing by  Andre Grenon )
