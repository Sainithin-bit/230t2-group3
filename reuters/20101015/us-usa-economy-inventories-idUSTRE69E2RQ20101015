 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Inventories at U.S. businesses rose strongly in August, but sales barely budged, a Commerce Department report on Friday showed. 

 Inventories rose 0.6 percent, slightly more than analysts' expectations for a 0.5 percent gain. Inventories in July were revised to up 1.1 percent, initially reported as a 1 percent increase. However, business sales in August rose only 0.1 percent, causing the inventory to sales ratio, which measures how long it takes to sell current inventories, to increase to 1.27 months. This gauge was at its highest pace since November. Gains in inventories were a large part of the increase in gross domestic product at the beginning of the year, but this faded as economic growth slowed in the second quarter. The strong inventory gains in the first two months of the third quarter are likely to make a significant contribution to GDP growth. (Reporting by  Neil Stempleman , Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
