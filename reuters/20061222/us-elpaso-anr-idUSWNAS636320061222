 NEW YORK/CALGARY, Alberta  (Reuters) - El Paso Corp. said on Friday it will sell its second-largest pipeline system, a storage business, and a stake in another pipeline system to TransCanada Corp. and TC PipeLines LP for $3.39 billion. 

 TransCanada ( TRP.TO ), already Canada's biggest pipeline company, bulks up its gas-transmission business with the purchase, adding 10,500 miles of new pipe, a 40 percent increase. The Canadian firm will also assume $744 million of debt. "This furthers TransCanada's dominance in natural-gas transmission and bolsters the storage side of their business," said Garey Aitken, a portfolio manager at Bissett Investment Management, one of TransCanada's largest shareholders. The sale of a core pipeline asset is a departure for El Paso, but the company, which has been in the midst of a massive restructuring, said the deal will allow it to clean up its balance sheet immediately. "Overall, this is a positive and opportunistic transaction that better positions El Paso for long-term growth on a healthier financial footing," Wachovia analyst Samuel Brothwell wrote in a research note. Disposing of the assets will lower El Paso's cost of raising capital by boosting its credit-worthiness. El Paso's chief executive, Doug Foshee, said in a statement that along with its other restructuring efforts, the sale would immediately raise the company's credit rating "to a level that is at or very near an investment-grade level." Pipeline assets have been in demand recently because they have low operating costs and generate large amounts of cash. They are also insulated from some of the peaks and valleys that typically mark the energy business. Earlier this year, management of oil and gas pipeline operator Kinder Morgan Inc. ( KMI.N ) announced plans for a $15 billion management buyout with the help of private equity firms that included Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, American International Group Inc. ( AIG.N ), Carlyle Group and Riverstone Holdings. Kinder Morgan has more than 30,000 miles of pipelines. TransCanada will buy ANR Pipeline Co., one of the largest interstate natural gas pipelines in the United States with peak capacity of 6.8 billion cubic feet per day. The Canadian firm is also buying ANR's storage company and a 3.55 percent stake in Great Lakes Gas Transmission LP, which owns and operates a 2,115-mile (3,400 kilometer) natural gas pipeline that links Western Canada to Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan and Eastern Canada. TransCanada already owns a 50 percent stake in Great Lakes. "We are very much solidifying our position as the leading North American energy infrastructure company," Hal Kvisle, TransCanada's chief executive, said on a conference call. The rest of El Paso's stake in Great Lakes -- a 46.45 percent interest -- will be acquired by TC PipeLines TCLP.O, a limited partnership managed by TransCanada. Wachovia's Brothwell said the deal likely fetched a record multiple for U.S. pipelines. He estimated the deal's value at around 11.4 times the earnings of the assets being sold, before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. El Paso shares rose 76 cents to $15.58 on the New York Stock Exchange. TC PipeLines shares rose $2.23 to $34.50 on Nasdaq, and TransCanada shares fell 69 Canadian cents to C$40.08 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The deal is expected to the first quarter of next year. 2007 first quarter. ($1=$1.16 Canadian)
