 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. consumer sentiment slipped in 
December but was not far from the year's highs, a report said 
on Friday, suggesting Americans were guardedly optimistic about 
the economy in the holiday season. 

  The University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment 
index declined to 91.7 in December from 92.1 in November. The 
drop was less severe than expected on Wall Street, where the 
median forecast in a Reuters poll called for a reading of 90.2.  A measure of current conditions edged up on the month, but 
expectations about the future deteriorated. Price expectations 
over a one-year period, an important guidepost for interest 
rate policy, dipped to 2.9 percent, its lowest since February 
2005. That index was at 3.0 percent in November.  Analysts said the data should provide further encouragement 
to the Federal Reserve that it may be able to start cutting 
interest rates sometime over the next two quarters, especially 
if incoming economic reports continue to show weakness.  Another release on Friday showed that a closely watched 
barometer of consumer costs eased in November.  "The inflation readings show contained inflation 
expectations, as the Fed has been hoping for," said Pierre 
Ellis, senior economist at Decision Economics.  The stock market was not much affected by the data, 
although the dollar did get a boost from the improvement in 
consumer confidence.
