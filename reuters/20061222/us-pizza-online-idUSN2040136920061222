 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Pizza fans are starting to build and order pies online in a trend that Papa John's International Inc. hopes will help it grab a bigger slice of the delivery business pie. 

 All of the top U.S. pizza delivery chains -- Domino's Pizza Inc., Pizza Hut and Papa John's -- are investing in online ordering to help boost business in one of the restaurant industry's most competitive segments. But underdog Papa John's said its Netflix-style ordering service -- available at every store -- is one reason it has posted robust sales increases for most of this year while bigger rivals have struggled. At Papa John's, Internet orders can be placed for any of the company's 2,600 pizza parlors from a single Web site, up to 21 days in advance, and revenue from Web orders is expected to more than double this year to more than $200 million. Chief Executive Nigel Travis, who helped start Blockbuster Inc.'s online service before joining Papa John's, said he expects online orders to enjoy that level of growth "for the foreseeable future." By ordering online, customers are able to peruse Papa John's entire menu list of promotions and take their time deciding what to get. That means higher sales, Travis said. Finally, orders are saved in the system so they can be repeated on a later occasion and the millions of e-mail addresses collected by Papa John's can be used to market directly to customers in their inboxes. Pizza Hut said its online business has also more than doubled in each of the last three years. In contrast to Papa John's, however, the Yum Brands Inc. unit only offers online orders at about a quarter of its 6,250 U.S. restaurants. Officials from both Pizza Hut and Domino's declined to give interviews about their online strategies, saying they do not want to give anything away to competitors. Domino's, like Pizza Hut, only offers Web orders in a portion of its more than 5,000 U.S. stores. A spokeswoman declined to say how many. That makes Papa John's the only U.S. chain to offer the service at all of its restaurants using a single Web site and ordering system -- a major advantage for the No. 3 player, according to Travis. "Online customers spend more money and come back more often," he said, adding that the chain has plans to advertise the service nationally through television ads and the sponsorship of a college football game, the PapaJohns.com Bowl, this Saturday. But one analyst says it is still too soon for Papa John's to declare victory when it comes to what is still a small part of the overall pizza pie. "Everyone is either doing it or about to do it. It's hard to say who is best," said Darren Tristano, executive vice president of research firm Technomic Inc. "It's very unlikely that you are going to switch over to the other because of online ordering. Consumers are very brand loyal to the pizza that they eat." Still, Tristano said he expects the number of consumers who order pizza online -- about 13 percent -- "to grow dramatically over the next few years." The nation's top chains agree, and Travis said the shift to online ordering is good business because eventually restaurants will be able to operate with less staff. "One day we will be able to realize labor savings but we haven't realized it yet today," he said.
