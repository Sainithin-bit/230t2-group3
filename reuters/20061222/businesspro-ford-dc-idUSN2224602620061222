 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co.'s ( F.N ) new chief 
executive Alan Mulally's agenda calls for the motor company to 
plow through "gut-wrenching" change to achieve profitability by 
2009, the Wall Street Journal reported on its Web site on 
Friday. 

  The WSJ reported that at a board meeting last week, Mulally 
surprised directors by asking them to follow him from the 
boardroom, down a flight of stairs to his secret "war room," 
where his plan for the company is mounted on the walls, the WSJ 
reported, citing people familiar with the situation.  The pages contain charts, graphs and lists of Ford products 
and markets -- his road map to turn around the troubled auto 
maker, the paper reported.  The paper also printed the full text of a company-wide 
email it says Mulally sent on October 13. In the email, Mulally 
writes that the company is going though an "extraordinarily 
gut-wrenching time."  The paper reported that in the email, he predicted, "Some 
very good and loyal people are going to leave this company 
between now and next summer, and that's going to be tough on 
everyone." But he added: "As demoralizing as a slide down may 
be, the ride back up is infinitely more exhilarating."  In a note to clients earlier this month, Merrill Lynch 
analyst John Murphy said he expected Mulally to give more 
detail on his operating plan as soon as the Detroit Auto show 
in early January.  Ford in September warned its auto business would not make a 
profit in North America for another three years. The company is 
slashing costs and jobs to turn the business around.  Former Boeing ( BA.N ) executive Mulally was named chief 
executive early September and took on the position full-time in 
October.
