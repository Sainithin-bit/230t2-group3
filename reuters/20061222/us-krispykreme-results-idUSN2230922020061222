 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Krispy Kreme Doughnuts Inc. ( KKD.N ) posted a first-quarter loss on Friday and said revenue fell slightly less than expected in a delayed quarterly report filed with U.S. regulators. 

 The struggling doughnut chain posted a loss of $6 million, or 10 cents per share, for the quarter ended April 30, compared to a loss of $53.4 million, or 86 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue fell 21.7 percent to $119.4 million. In June, Krispy Kreme said it expected to post a 24 percent drop in revenue, due in part to lower sales to franchisees, and a loss on costs associated with legal and regulatory problems for the quarter. Krispy Kreme previously said it could not file its quarterly report because it devoted substantial resources to completing its annual report for 2005.
