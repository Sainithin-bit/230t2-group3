 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Charles Schwab Corp. SCHW.O said on Friday it will pay $115 million in cash for The 401(k) Company, a retirement plan administrator that oversees nearly $22 billion in assets. 

 The discount brokerage wants to bolster its retirement plan business, and will have plenty of resources to do that after it completes the sale of its U.S. Trust Corp. unit for $3.3 billion to Bank of America Corp. Schwab said it expects the The 401(k) Company deal to close by the end of the 2007 first quarter. The 401(k) Company, now owned by Nationwide Financial Services Inc. NFS.N, will operate under the umbrella of Schwab's corporate and retirement services division. The 401(k) Company's sales rose 26 percent to $1.32 billion during the nine months ended September 30, according to Nationwide Financial reports. Sales at the company grow as it adds large retirement plans to its accounts. During the past two years, The 401(k) Company's newly acquired plans have averaged more than $500 million in assets and more than 8,000 participants, Schwab said. At the end of September, the Austin, Texas, company oversaw the administration of about $21.7 billion in assets for 100 companies with 400,000 participants, Nationwide Financial said. During a presentation earlier this month, Schwab executives said they were looking for deals in the 401(k) arena, which includes the retirement savings of U.S. corporate workers. The company wants to focus on providing low-cost services to ordinary investors. That is part of the reason for selling U.S. Trust Corp., which caters to wealthy clients.
