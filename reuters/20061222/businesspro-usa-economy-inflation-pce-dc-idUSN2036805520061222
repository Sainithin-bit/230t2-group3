 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. incomes and spending rose more 
modestly than expected in November, while core consumer prices 
were unexpectedly flat in the month, a government report showed 
on Friday. 

  Incomes rose 0.3 percent in November after a 0.3 percent 
gain in October, while spending climbed 0.5 percent after 
increasing 0.3 percent a month earlier, the Commerce Department 
said.  Analysts polled by Reuters were expecting income to rise 
0.4 percent and spending to increase by 0.6 percent.  Core consumer prices, which exclude volatile food and 
energy costs, were flat in November after rising 0.2 percent in 
October. Analysts were expecting core prices to increase 0.2 
percent.  It was the first time since October 2002 that core consumer 
prices were unchanged from month to month. The last time there 
was a drop in core prices was in September 2001, when core 
prices dipped 0.5 percent.  Core prices rose 2.2 percent from November a year ago, a 
slower pace than the 2.4 percent 12 month rise in October, and 
likely to give comfort to officials at the Federal Reserve, who 
have said inflation is at uncomfortably high levels.
