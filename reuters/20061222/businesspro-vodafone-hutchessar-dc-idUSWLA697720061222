 LONDON  (Reuters) - British mobile phone giant Vodafone 
Group Plc ( VOD.L ) is considering the acquisition of a 
controlling interest in India's Hutchison Essar, it said on 
Friday. 

  Vodafone said the process was at an early stage. A bid for 
Hutchison Essar could cost over $13 billion, according to 
reports.  Vodafone said in a statement its board believed the mobile 
market in India has great potential and a move for Hutchison 
Essar would be consistent with its stated strategy of seeking 
selective acquisition opportunities in developing markets.
