 ZURICH  (Reuters) - Swiss drugmaker Novartis ( NOVN.VX ) said on Friday its Exforge medicine had received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a new treatment for patients with high blood pressure. 

 The FDA issued a tentative approval because Exforge has met all the required standards for safety, efficacy and manufacturing quality, Novartis said. "Exforge is expected to be available to patients in the U.S. in late September 2007, pending the expiration of market exclusivity and patent protection for amlodipine besylate," the company said. Exforge combines in one pill the two most commonly prescribed hypertension medicines in their categories -- Novartis' Diovan and Pfizer's ( PFE.N ) Norvasc (amlodipine besylate). Novartis shares were down 0.2 percent at 70.35 Swiss francs by 0951 GMT, broadly in line with a largely unchanged DJ Stoxx index of European healthcare providers .SXDP. Analysts at Vontobel called the Exforge approval a "nice Christmas present" for Novartis. "The most obvious market for Exforge are the over $4.5 billion of sales Pfizer makes with Norvasc, but it should also help to prolong the life cycle for Diovan," they said. Exforge is seen as a key near-term sales driver, together with diabetes drug Galvus and blood pressure treatment Tekturna, though they are also the firm's major risks if there are any delays in their rollout. All three are expected to be launched in 2007. In November, Exforge was granted a positive opinion by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), the regulatory agency that reviews European Union submissions for new medicines, Novartis said. "Novartis expects to receive approval from the European Commission and to make Exforge available in the EU during the first half of 2007," the company said. The need for new antihypertensive medicines was urgent, as seven out of 10 patients are not at their target blood pressure, Novartis said. High blood pressure is a leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease, which is the world's most common cause of death.
