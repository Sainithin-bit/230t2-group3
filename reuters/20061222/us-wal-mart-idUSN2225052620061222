 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) is expected to announce a new ad agency -- its second switch in two months -- as early as Friday, the New York Post reported on its Web site. 

 The decision will come down to two finalists - Ogilvy & Mather and the Martin Agency, the Post reported. Omnicom Group Inc.'s ( OMC.N ) GSD&M handled Wal-Mart's account for years, but the world's largest retailer earlier this year decided to put the $580 million account up for review. In October, Wal-Mart awarded the account to Interpublic Group of Cos Inc.'s ( IPG.N ) DraftFCB and Carat, owned by Britain's Aegis Group Plc AGS.L. In another twist, the company earlier this month said that its head of marketing communications, Julie Roehm, who led the switch, left the company. The retailer shortly after said it would reopen bidding for the advertising account.
