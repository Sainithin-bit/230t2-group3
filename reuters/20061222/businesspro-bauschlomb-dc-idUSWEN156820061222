 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Eye products maker Bausch & Lomb 
BOL.N, which is struggling to overcome a major product recall 
and a number of accounting issues, said on Friday the New York 
Stock Exchange has granted an extension for its continued 
listing on the exchange. 

  The extension, which is subject to continuing review, gives 
the company until March 1 to file its 2005 annual report with 
the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Bausch & Lomb said it will file the 2005 Form 10-K as soon 
as practicable.  If it misses the March 1 deadline, the NYSE could either 
grant a final additional extension to April 2 or move forward 
with suspension and delisting procedures.
