 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve Board on Friday said it has terminated an enforcement action against Citigroup Inc. ( C.N ) in 2003 over its transactions with Enron Corp. prior to the energy giant's collapse in December 2001. 

 In a statement, the Fed provided no further details on the termination of the written agreement, which required Citigroup to make revisions to its credit risk management programs, particularly with regard to complex structured finance transactions. The July 28, 2003, agreement with Fed mandated the changes after a regulatory review of Citigroup's transactions with Enron involving special-purpose entities and prepaid commodity forward transactions. The review "raised concerns that the manner in which Citigroup and its subsidiaries participated in the structured transactions exposed them to significant risks and that Citigroup and its subsidiaries did not adequately assess the goals, purposes and results of the structured transactions and their potential risks," the Fed said in the 2003 agreement. The agreement required Citigroup to improve its credit risk management program, including new written procedures for due diligence, documentation and ensuring that credit decision makers possess necessary information to evaluate the counterparty's credit risk profiles.
