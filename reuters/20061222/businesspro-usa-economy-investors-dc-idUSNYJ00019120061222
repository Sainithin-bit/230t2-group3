 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Investor confidence in the U.S. 
economy fell slightly in December but still remained high, 
responding to rallying stock markets and the shift from a 
Republican to a Democratic Congress, according to the 
UBS/Gallup Index of Investor Optimism released on Friday. 

  The UBS/Gallup Index fell 3 points to 90, its 
second-highest reading of the year. The index peaked at 93 in 
January and again in November.  "Although investors have concerns about the real estate 
market, the continued rally in the equity markets fueled by 
solid corporate earnings is driving investors' positive 
feelings about the current investment climate," said Robin 
Miranda, associate strategist, UBS Wealth Management Research 
Americas.  Thirty-eight percent of investors believe the shift from a 
Republican to a Democratic Congress will positively affect the 
investment climate, while 28 percent believe the change will 
have a negative impact. A further 32 percent believe the change 
in control will have no impact at all.  The UBS/Gallup survey covers about 800 households from 
around the United States with investments of $10,000 or more. 
Nearly 40 percent of American Households have at least this 
amount of savings and investments.
