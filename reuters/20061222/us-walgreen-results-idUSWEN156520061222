 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Walgreen Co. ( WAG.N ), the largest U.S. drugstore chain, posted a 25-percent jump in quarterly profit on Friday, aided by new and acquired stores, and stronger sales of generic prescriptions, sending its shares up nearly 3 percent. 

 The results topped analysts' expectations. They come as Walgreen continues to face off against Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) and its $4-prescription plan on some generic drugs, and as Walgreen's largest rival, CVS Corp. ( CVS.N ), tries to buy Caremark Rx Inc. CMX.N, which brokers deals on medicine pricing. "We'll never lack strong competitors, new retail concepts and more regulation," Director of Finance Rick Hans said in a statement. "But we've thrived despite those issues, and we feel more confident about our future than ever before." Profit was $431.7 million, or 43 cents per share, in the fiscal first quarter ended November 30, compared with $345.6 million, or 34 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts, on average, had expected Walgreen to earn 41 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Walgreen, CVS and other drug chains have not matched the $4 monthly plan started by Wal-Mart. The drugstores assert that they can attract customers with convenient locations and services rather than having to compete on price and that the overwhelming majority of their customers have insurance to cover much of the cost of their drugs. Shares of Walgreen fell 7.3 percent on September 21, the day that Wal-Mart unveiled its $4 plan. Since then, the shares have risen less than 1 percent. Sales of lower-priced generic drugs can slow revenue growth, but Walgreen said that it doesn't mind that since generic drugs are more profitable because they carry higher margins. Walgreen said sales of prescription medications, which accounted for 65.7 percent of total sales, rose 18.7 percent. Prescription sales at stores open at least a year rose 11.9 percent, with the number of prescriptions filled in those stores up 7.4 percent. Some of the prescription growth stemmed from consumers who came to the store under Medicare Part D plans for senior citizens. "We're earning less money on prescriptions for Medicare Part D patients who previously paid cash for their medications, but overall the program has benefited us because of the increased business we're attracting under it," President and Chief Executive Jeffrey Rein said in a statement. Deerfield, Illinois-based Walgreen said earlier this month that sales in the quarter rose 16.6 percent to $12.71 billion. GROWTH PLANS ON TRACK In the past year, Walgreen acquired the Happy Harry's chain, which added 76 stores to its lineup, and rapidly opened new stores. As of November 30, it operated 5,580 stores, up from 5,068 a year earlier. While CVS has nearly 6,200 stores, its revenue trails Walgreen. Walgreen said it still plans to add more than 400 units in the current fiscal year and have 7,000 stores in 2010. At the same time, rival CVS is growing, most recently with the acquisition of about 700 Sav-on and Osco drugstores from Albertsons Inc. CVS also plans to buy major pharmacy benefits manager Caremark, but on Monday, Caremark rival Express Scripts Inc. ( ESRX.O ) swooped in with a higher offer. William Blair analyst Mark Miller, in a research note issued on Wednesday, said that Express Scripts' competing offer for Caremark "is a modest incremental positive to Walgreens, in our view, as it raises the potential for distraction for three direct competitors (and the higher ultimate cost leaves less room to compete on price with payors and consumers)." Walgreen and CVS already operate their own pharmacy benefit manager units. Shares of Walgreen were up 56 cents, or 1.2 percent, at $46.52 after rising as high as $47.28 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Walgreen said that it repurchased 7.9 million shares for $343 million during the quarter, completing its four-year, $1 billion share buyback plan 18 months ahead of schedule.
