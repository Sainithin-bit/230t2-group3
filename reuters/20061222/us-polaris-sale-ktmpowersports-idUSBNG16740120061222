 BANGALORE  (Reuters) - U.S. snowmobile maker Polaris Industries Inc. ( PII.N ) said it agreed to sell 20 percent stake in KTM Power Sports AG ( KTMP.VI ) to a unit of KTM's largest shareholder, Cross Industries AG, for about 58.5 million euros. 

 After the sale of about 1.38 million shares, Polaris will retain ownership of about 0.34 million shares, slightly less than 5 percent of outstanding shares of the Austrian motorcycle maker. A 20 percent stake in KTM has a market value of around 67 million euros ($88 million). "(The sale) will have a minor effect on its earnings per share," Wedbush Morgan Securities analyst Rommel Dionisio said over the telephone. Polaris said since the purchase price was close to the asset value, it no longer saw a net benefit from its percentage of KTM's income in its income statement and expects this to hurt its fourth-quarter and 2006 earnings forecast by about 2 cents a share. Polaris, which had acquired a 25 percent stake in KTM for about $83 million, had planned to take a majority stake in the Austrian company by 2007. The plan, however, collapsed when Austrian investment company Cross Industries said it would not sell its 50 percent interest in KTM to Polaris. "We respect KTM's decision to remain independent and look forward to furthering our strategic relationship with them in the future," said Polaris Chief Executive Officer Tom Tiller in a statement. "The company, I believe, continues to pursue other acquisitions," said Dionisio. Polaris, which also makes all-terrain vehicles and motorcycles, has been struggling to cope with sagging demand for its snowmobiles. "Polaris is No. 2 in snowmobiles and ATVs and is expected to gain share in the motorcycle market," Robert W. Baird & Co. analyst Craig Kennison wrote in a research note. "Motorcycles is definitely an area focus for the company going forward. Motorcycles, even though it's a small business now, over the next few years can be a meaningful growth driver for the company," Dionisio said. Cross had announced earlier this year it had an option to buy the Polaris stake in October of next year and planned to use it. The purchase agreement now signed replaces this option, KTM said. Polaris plans to use the sale proceeds to either buy back shares under its current share repurchase authorization, or to reduce the outstanding balance of its revolving loan facility. Polaris shares fell 26 cents to $46.85 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange, while shares of KTM closed down 5 euro cents at 48.40 euros on the Vienna Stock Exchange.
