 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - American International Group Inc ( AIG.N ) believes $30 billion for its Asian unit, AIA is too low, and the U.S. insurer is not in a rush to do a deal, a source familiar with the matter said late on Friday. 

 AIG believes it has many options for AIA, the source said. AIG views AIA as a "valuable property" and does not want to sacrifice value, the source said. Prudential Plc ( PRU.L ) has entered talks to cut its $35.5 billion offer for AIG's ( AIG.N ) Asian life insurance arm, in a last-ditch bid to salvage a deal criticized by shareholders as too expensive.
