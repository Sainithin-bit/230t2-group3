 TOULOUSE, France  (Reuters) - Following are highlights of a news conference on 2007 industrial performance given by Airbus officials on Wednesday. 

 Participants: CEO Tom Enders Commercial Director John Leahy EVP Programmes Tom Williams COO Fabrice Bregier Enders: We remain in the game. We will put every effort into reaching our target for (13 A380) deliveries in 2008. Airbus aims for total production of 54 aircraft a month by 2010 - 4 A380, 40 A320 family, 10 A330/340 Power8 delivered cost savings very considerably ahead of schedule in 2007. The official version is more than 300 million euros; I can tell you it is close to 500 million euros for the first year in 2007. We do not expect 2008 to be as strong as 2007; we forecast the order intake should be clearly above our delivery figure. Need to stabilise A400M programme. EADS has announced delays of 6-12 months. I confirm this to you today. We are working hard particularly with the members o the engine consortium...to get the plane flying this summer. (Declines comment on profitability in 2007). Are we disapointed at coming second in net orders in 2007? What counts for us is that it is a record year. If we had half the orders of Boing that would be something to think about, but a few orders less -- we are absolutely not disappointed These are quality orders at better than planned prices. We are discussing additional measures beyond Power8. Power8 was tailored to 1.35. We need to be less dependent on the dollar exchange rate. Today our true costs are 30 percent in dollars. We need to improve on that and have more value-added in dollar-denominated and low-cost areas, not necessarily in the US. Bregier: We first squeezed the costs and obtained the low-hanging fruit but we also renegotiated with partners, not only putting pressure on them but leveraging (better ways of operating). We arranged up (production) aggressively. We told EADS nd believe that we will achieve that. Leahy: We are probably at top of cycle in terms of orders but production will keep building up for many years. There used to be canyons and deep troughs in this industry, now it looks more like hills and valleys. We expect 2008 orders to be significantly above our production level. We expect a shallower downturn than we have seen in previous cycles. Enders: (Asked about Frnch regulator AMF probe on insider trading): There is nothing new on the AMF issue. I am fully concentrating on management issues. We are fully confident we have done nothing wrong and the AMF inquiry is not worrying us a bit. Williams (On A400M) The critical path is through the engine. That's the most important issue for us to attack. But we do have our own internal issues and not simply (on) wiring. This is a unique design. We have had a lot of work to get the architecture right. But the A400M was still developed under the old GIE (consortium) model with national-based development teams. I am confident we wll have the aircrft ready on time and ready to fly this summer. The engine situation needs to be monitiored very closely. That is my number one concern today. Bregier We are slightly below the 2006 headcount. (Airbus statement says 30 percent of overhead positions were reduced in 2007). Enders: (On dollar, which EADS executives recently described as a matter of Airbus survival). We are not taking anything back in what we said (on the dollar) last year. Facing a dollar as low as it is, and maybe even above $1.50 (to the euro), this is in the medium to long term an existential issue for the company. We need to be able to change the company to cope with the the low dollar. We are making sure the company is prepared. You can already see some of these (extra measures) developing, for example on international deployment. For us internaionalisation and the dollar are part of the same issue. (END OF NEWS CONFERENCE)
