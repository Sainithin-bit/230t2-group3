 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Activist shareholder Carl Icahn said on Wednesday he would support Oracle's ORCL.O $8.5 billion acquisition of business software maker BEA Systems Inc BEAS.O. 

 Affiliates of Icahn, who hold nearly 13 percent of BEA's common stock, will vote in favor of the merger, Icahn said in a statement. "This transaction is an excellent example of the great results that can be achieved for all constituencies when the shareholder activist is able to work cooperatively with management," Icahn said Oracle raised its offer to $19.375 per share from $17 per share in October. BEA had previously demanded $21 per share. (Reporting by Christopher Kaufman, editing by Maureen Bavdek)
