 TOULOUSE, France  (Reuters) - European planemaker Airbus ( EAD.PA ) posted 1,341 net aircraft orders in 2007, trailing the 1,413 planes sold by Boeing ( BA.N ) in a record year at both companies, Airbus said on Wednesday. 

 Airbus took in 1,458 gross orders before cancellations, compared with Boeing's gross order tally of 1,423 aircraft, the planemaker said. "These are enormous numbers; it was a staggering year. Now it becomes a question of how we manage the backlog," Airbus chief Tom Enders told journalists in Toulouse, France, where Airbus is based. The planemaker, a subsidiary of European aerospace group EADS, kept its lead as the world's largest producer of large commercial aircraft in 2007, but lost to Boeing in the race for new orders for the second year running. In 2006, Airbus sold 790 aircraft compared with 1,044 net orders for Boeing. Airbus said its 2007 deliveries reached a record of 453 aircraft, topping its published forecast of 440 to 450 planes. For 2008, Enders predicted deliveries above 470 aircraft and an order intake down from last year's peak, but above the level of deliveries. Airbus said it had exceeded its targets in the first year of a four-year restructuring and cost-saving program, called Power8, delivering cost savings of more than 300 million euros ($445 million).
