 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Boeing Co ( BA.N ) said on Wednesday it would not hit its target of delivering 109 787 Dreamliners by the end of 2009. 

 Boeing airplane unit chief Scott Carson said the company was working on a revised delivery schedule after its announcement earlier on Wednesday that production on the plane would be delayed by three months. (Reporting by  Bill Rigby , editing by Mark Porter)
