 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Brocade Communications Systems Inc's ( BRCD.O ) former chief was sentenced on Wednesday to 21 months in prison for backdating stock-option grants in a scandal that has ensnared scores of U.S. companies and led to billions of dollars of restatements. 

 Gregory Reyes, 45, was allowed to remain free pending his appeal in the case. He stood calmly as Judge Charles Breyer of U.S. District Court in San Francisco imposed the sentence. Breyer also fined Reyes $15 million and found that Reyes had obstructed justice in preparing for his trial. (Reporting by  Philipp Gollner  and Amanda Beck; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)
