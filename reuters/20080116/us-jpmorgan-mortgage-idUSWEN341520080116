 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co Inc Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said the bank is prepared for a recession if it comes. 

 "We're not predicting a recession because that's not our jobs, but we are prepared in almost every way possible to the extent that we can see it," Dimon said. He made his remarks during a conference call with analysts. Despite escalating losses on credit to consumers, JPMorgan continues to seek market share gains in the U.S. mortgage market. Dimon said the bank's market share has risen to 11 percent from 6 percent. (Reporting by  Tim McLaughlin ; Editing by  Derek Caney )
