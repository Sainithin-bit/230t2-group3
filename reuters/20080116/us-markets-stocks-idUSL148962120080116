 NEW YORK (Reuters) -The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq fell in choppy trade on Wednesday, as pessimism about the U.S. economy mounted after Intel Corp ( INTC.O ), the world's largest chip maker, posted earnings and a profit forecast that disappointed investors. 

 But the Dow edged higher as JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ), the No. 3 U.S. bank, provided comparative relief from the gloom cast by Citigroup's record quarterly loss on Tuesday, with results that showed some banks can still make a profit despite troubles in the credit market. Semiconductors, computer hardware and software shares were among the worst drags following Intel's results, which challenged the view that technology stocks, especially those with overseas customers, would be a safe haven in a U.S. economic slowdown. Intel microprocessors are the computing engines of about 80 percent of the world's personal computers. "There's still a lot of pessimism out there. A lot of people are talking about recession and that the credit crisis is spreading. Plus some of the early earnings reports, like Intel, disappointed investors," said Giri Cherukuri, head trader at OakBrook Investments LLC, which oversees $1.3 billion in Lisle, Illinois. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was up 13.17 points, or 0.11 percent, at 12,514.28. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was down 3.44 points, or 0.25 percent, at 1,377.51. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was down 21.36 points, or 0.88 percent, at 2,396.23. Economic data on Wednesday left the door open for the Federal Reserve to slash interest rates later this month to shore up an economy that some fear is on the brink of recession. U.S. consumer prices rose modestly in December, while industrial production was flat. Shares of Intel dropped 11.6 percent to $20.05 on the Nasdaq. Other major tech shares trading sharply lower were Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ), down 4 percent to $162, and Blackberry maker Research in Motion Ltd RIM.TORIMM.O, down 2.4 percent to $88.88. Energy stocks were another big drag on the market after crude oil futures fell 1.9 percent to $89.96 a barrel on a surprisingly large weekly increase in U.S. inventories. Shares of Devon Energy Corp ( DVN.N ) fell 3.5 percent to $83.05, and oil field services company Schlumberger Ltd ( SLB.N ) fell 4.7 percent to $84.74. JPMorgan shares rose 8.4 percent at $42.50. The bank reported a larger-than-expected drop in profit; still it was seen as doing better than some rivals, such as Citigroup Inc ( C.N ), whose stock slipped 0.7 percent to $26.78 a day after reporting a $9.83 billion loss.
