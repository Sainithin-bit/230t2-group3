 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Legislation to stimulate the slumping U.S. economy could be passed by Congress and signed into law within one month, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said on Wednesday. 

 "I think it can be done in 30 days," Hoyer told reporters, adding that "bipartisanship is breaking out all over." Congressional leaders and President George W. Bush are expected to meet in coming days to discuss legislation that could include tax rebates for workers with the aim of putting more money in people's pockets to spend.
