 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Net overall capital inflows into the United States in November rose to their highest in nearly two years, boosted by a surge in private investments, data from the Treasury Department showed on Wednesday. 

 November's inflows expanded to $149.9 billion, from a revised $92.2 billion in October, more than sufficient to cover the month's U.S. trade deficit of $63.1 billion. Net long-term capital inflows totaled $90.9 billion from $114.0 billion in October. Investments during the month were propped up by private inflows of $104.9 billion, from $50.5 billion in October. Net official flows totaled $45.0 billion. "Inflows were much better than expected, but it's a very volatile data," said Camilla Sutton, senior currency strategist, at Scotia Capital in Toronto. Markets were expecting inflows of $65 billion. "Overall, it is certainly one of the better indicators we've seen so far. But it would take several months of positive numbers to reassure the markets," she added. The dollar and the U.S. Treasury market showed little reaction to the U.S. capital inflows data. Data showed that foreigners purchased a net $23.5 billion in U.S. Treasuries, down from $49.8 billion in October. Equity purchases declined in November, falling to $4.6 billion from $30.2 billion the previous month. Foreign buying of agency bonds increased, however, to $26.6 billion from $14.9 billion in October. Japan was still the largest holder of U.S. Treasuries, with $580.9 billion during the month, from $591.7 billion in October. Japan's holdings were the lowest since December 2003. China, meanwhile, again pared back its Treasury holdings to $386.8 billion from $387.0 billion previously. (Reporting by  Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss ; Editing by  Andrea Ricci )
