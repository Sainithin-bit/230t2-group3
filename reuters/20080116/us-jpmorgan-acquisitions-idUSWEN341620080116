 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co Inc ( JPM.N ) Chief Executive Jamie Dimon on Wednesday said the bank would be more likely to make acquisitions amid rocky financial conditions. 

 "In terms of either buying assets or buying companies, we're very open minded," Dimon said during a conference call. "This environment doesn't change that at all. It just may make it more likely." Dimon said there's no preference to buy healthy companies or ones in troubled situations, or ones involving assets outside the United States. "No preference, whatever makes sense for the shareholders of this company," Dimon said. (Reporting by  Tim McLaughlin ; Editing by  Derek Caney )
