 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Boeing Co ( BA.N ) is set to announce further delays on its new airplane, the 787 Dreamliner, as it struggles with out of sequence work and shortages of key parts, according to a source familiar with the situation. 

 A further delay on the program, which is already six months behind schedule, would be a blow for a number of small and medium-sized companies making components for the 787, pushing back their revenue on the lucrative program and potentially causing inventory problems. The following is a list of 10 suppliers with a significant portion of their revenue exposed to Boeing's 787 program, and what they are producing for the 787. Spirit Aerosystems Holdings Inc ( SPR.N ) -- nose, forward fuselage, pylons Hexcel Corp ( HXL.N ) -- composite materials Precision Castparts Corp ( PCP.N ) -- bolts, castings, forgings Goodrich Corp GR.N -- landing gear, cargo system, brakes, nacelles Moog Inc ( MOGa.N ) -- actuators TransDigm Group Inc ( TDG.N ) -- audio system Rockwell Collins Inc ( COL.N ) -- cockpit displays, communications system Triumph Group Inc ( TGI.N ) -- composite ducts, fittings, windows Barnes ( B.N ) -- engine nozzles Meggitt Plc ( MGGT.L ) -- engine sensors Sources for supplier information: Boeing, company reports, Bank of America (Reporting by  Bill Rigby , editing by Carol Bishopric)
