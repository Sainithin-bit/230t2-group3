 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Brocade Communications Systems Inc's ( BRCD.O ) former chief executive Gregory Reyes was fined $15 million on Wednesday for backdating stock option grants. 

 U.S. District Court Judge Charles Breyer said at a sentencing hearing that Reyes obstructed justice in preparing for trial. A jury in August found Reyes guilty on all counts in the government's first criminal trial of stock options backdating. (Reporting by  Nichola Groom )
