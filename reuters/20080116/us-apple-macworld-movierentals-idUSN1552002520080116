 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Apple Inc Chief Executive Steve Jobs unveiled online movie rentals on Tuesday, beefing up the video offerings in its iTunes service in the face of increased competition. 

 Jobs said that every major movie studio supported the rentals, which would launch with more than 1,000 films in February. Rentals would cost $2.99 and $3.99, he said.
