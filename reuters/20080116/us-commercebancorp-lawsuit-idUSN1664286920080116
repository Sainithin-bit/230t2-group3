 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Commerce Bancorp Inc CBH.N has been sued by its founder and former chief executive, who said New Jersey's largest bank wrongly ousted him in June and owes more than $57 million of damages. 

 In a complaint filed Monday with the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., Vernon Hill said he was driven out when the bank settled a probe by the federal Office of the Comptroller of the Currency into dealings involving Commerce and Hill's family. "The OCC set upon a course to drive Mr. Hill out of Commerce based on unsubstantiated allegations," according to the complaint. Commerce, in turn, forced Hill to resign, ended his employment contract, and refused to pay amounts due under that contract because of "its fear that making such payments would antagonize its federal bank regulators," the complaint said. Hill is seeking damages of more than $50 million for himself, and more than $7.5 million for his wife Shirley and her architectural design firm InterArch Inc. The Hills are also seeking punitive damages. Several executives and directors are also defendants, including Commerce Bank Chairman Dennis DiFlorio and the bank's chief executive, Robert Falese. Commerce did not immediately return a request for comment. The Cherry Hill, New Jersey-based bank agreed in early October to be acquired by Canada's Toronto-Dominion Bank ( TD.TO ) for $8.5 billion. In regulatory filings, Commerce has described a variety of business dealings with insiders, including property leases with entities in which Hill was a partner, and the purchase of services from InterArch. As part of its settlement with the OCC, Commerce adopted governance changes including a ban on new real estate and vendor deals with insiders, a review or termination of prior deals, and a restructuring of some board committees. Hill founded Commerce in 1973. Using a model based more on retailing than banking, focused on customer-friendly services such as seven-day-a-week banking, he built a network of more than 400 branches in several mid-Atlantic states and Florida. Commerce shareholders are expected to vote on the Toronto-Dominion merger on February 6. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel; Additional reporting by  John Poirier ; Editing by  Tim Dobbyn )
