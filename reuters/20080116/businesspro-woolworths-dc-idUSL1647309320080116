 LONDON  (Reuters) - British sweets-to-DVDs retailer 
Woolworths WLW.L said trading over the key Christmas period 
had been "very challenging" but it expected its retail business 
to return to profitability this year. 

  Woolworths, one of Britain's most recognised high street 
names with more than 800 stores, said on Wednesday that retail 
like-for-like sales fell 3.2 percent in the 49 weeks to January 
12, after having fallen 0.4 percent in the 38 weeks to October 
27.  The retailer had said at the end of October that it 
expected like-for-like sales growth to be "flattish" for the 
full year, after it unveiled a dip in sales partly due to wet 
weather and sporting events.  "Christmas was a very challenging time for the group," 
Chief Executive Trevor Bish-Jones said in a trading update.  "We are pleased that the progress made across the group 
through this year is expected to lead to an improvement in 
profitability, including Woolworths Retail returning to 
profit," he added.  Woolworths said total group sales increased by 11.2 percent 
in the period and that it expected annual profits to be within 
the range of current market expectations.  The company is expected to report adjusted pretax profit of 
around 26.6 million pounds ($52.08 million) in the current year 
according to the average forecast of nine analysts given to 
Reuters Estimates, up from 21.8 million the previous year.  The retailer said it remained concerned about the 
underlying level of consumer confidence in the year ahead.  Shares in Woolworths closed at 10 pence on Tuesday, valuing 
the company at around 156.2 million pounds.  (Reporting by Mike Elliott, editing by Elizabeth Fullerton)
