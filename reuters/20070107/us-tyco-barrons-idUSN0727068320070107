 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Investors who hold shares in all three Tyco International Ltd ( TYC.N ) companies after the conglomerate is split up may be rewarded, according to T. Rowe Price fund managers and analysts cited in the January 8 edition of Barron's financial newspaper. 

 Contrary to pessimism over the previously scandal-plagued company seen by many Wall Street analysts, T. Rowe Price remains bullish about Tyco's prospects after it splits into three publicly traded companies -- one for health care, one for electronics and a third with its fire and security and engineering products and services businesses -- Barron's said. Based on fiscal 2008 projections of earnings for the three surviving companies, T. Rowe Price Capital Appreciation Fund co-manager Jeff Arricale sees them trading at a combined value of $38 to $45 a share, the newspaper reported. Tyco shares closed at $30.35 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday. "We think the price of Tyco has been unnaturally depressed because of investor battle fatigue and the fact that the industrial analysts who cover the company have lost interest in the company with the spin-off coming and a handoff of coverage to other analysts in the offing," Arricale told Barron's. T. Rowe Price analyst Peter Bates forecast that shares in the health-care products unit alone could reach $15 to $17 per share with the electronics business worth $12 to $14 a share.
