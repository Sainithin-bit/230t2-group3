 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp will triple its rate of annual sales in India over the next 18 months due to rising demand, GM Asia Pacific vice president Nick Reilly told reporters on Sunday. 

 Speaking on the sidelines of the North American International Auto Show, Reilly said GM's annualized sales rate in India will rise to 220,000 vehicles by mid-2008, from 65,000 in 2006. Reilly said he expects the overall Indian auto market to grow to sales of two million vehicles within six year, up from sales of one million in 2006. "India is probably the top of my list of interest," said Reilly, who is currently based in Shanghai, China. Reilly also said he expects 12 to 15 percent annual sales growth in each of the overall auto markets of India, China and Russia over the next three to four years.
