 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Chrysler Group on Sunday showed off a redesigned pair of minivans aimed at preserving the automaker's lead in the family-friendly class of vehicles at a time when its overall sales are sagging. 

 Chrysler, the U.S. unit of DaimlerChrysler AG, is banking that the minivans equipped with new features intended to make them "family rooms on wheels" can connect with a younger generation of parents. The 2008 Chrysler Town & Country and Dodge Caravan, which were unveiled at the North American International Auto Show here, have been redesigned with over 30 new features, including a swiveling second row of seats. Chrysler, which pioneered the minivan market in the early 1980s, introduced a storage feature known as "Stow 'n Go" in its current minivans, a convenience analysts credited with helping the automaker keep its top spot in the segment. The upcoming minivans add a "Swivel 'n Go" feature that allows the second row seats to rotate to face the third row. A removable table fits between the two rows of seats. Industry analysts and dealers say interior features and safety are more important to minivan buyers than other considerations such as performance, a formula Chrysler executives say the automaker followed closely. The redesigned minivans, scheduled to go on sale this fall, offer directed lighting for passengers, an integrated child booster seat and a rear-view mirror designed to let parents keep an eye on their kids in the rear seats. Chrysler has forecast a 2006 loss of some $1.3 billion after failing to respond to the shift from high-margin trucks and sport utility vehicles in the face of higher gas prices. DaimlerChrysler's U.S. sales were down 5.5 percent in 2006 and the auto group was overtaken by Toyota Motor Corp. as the No. 3 player in the American market. In response, Chrysler Group is readying a restructuring plan to be announced in February, aimed at cutting production costs sharply. The current Chrysler and Dodge minivan models are the company's top-selling vehicles and account for almost 20 percent of Chrysler's U.S. sales. Chrysler also sells more than twice as many minivans as the combined total for Toyota Sienna and Honda Motor Co's Odyssey, its closest competitors. General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. are scrapping minivans in favor of "crossover" vehicles that offer the handling characteristics of a car but with the roomier interior and higher ride of a SUV.
