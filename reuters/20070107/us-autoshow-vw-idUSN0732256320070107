 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Volkswagen ( VOWG.DE ) group vehicle sales advanced 9.3 percent to a record 5.73 million units in 2006 thanks to brisk growth around the world and across its brands, Europe's biggest carmaker said on Sunday. 

 Its core Volkswagen brand boosted car deliveries to customers by 10.0 percent to a record 3.39 million units in 2006 despite sluggish major markets, it added. Volkswagen group sales in western Europe rose 5.8 percent to 3.11 million units as deliveries in its home market of Germany swelled 7.3 percent to 1.11 million units. VW, the world's fourth-biggest carmaker, said it defended its market leadership in China's booming passenger car market by boosting sales there 24.3 percent to 711,000 vehicles. Sales in its South America/South Africa region gained 14.9 percent to 683,000 units, with deliveries in Brazil alone up 15.1 percent. New models helped U.S. sales continue their rebound, with deliveries up 5.9 percent in 2006 to 330,000 vehicles. The sales gain still left questions about the future of VW brand head Wolfgang Bernhard, who may leave the company following a boardroom coup that elevated his closest competitor, Audi brand head Martin Winterkorn, to the position of group CEO. The VW brand extended its market leadership in western Europe, with sales up 5.6 percent to 1.52 million cars. Premium brand Audi ( NSUG.DE ) posted its 13th consecutive year of record sales, which gained 9.2 percent to 905,000 vehicles worldwide in 2006. Western Europe sales rose 5.5 percent, deliveries in eastern Europe gained nearly 32 percent and China sales jumped almost 39 percent. Audi's U.S sales rose 8.5 percent to 90,000 vehicles. "This is a bump they are getting from the new vehicles, the Passat and the Jetta, but I don't know if it is really sustainable," Erich Merkle, director of forecasting for Michigan-based consulting group IRN Inc, said of VW brand sales growth. Merkle was more upbeat about Audi, which is spending billions to enter new market segments with models like the hot-selling Q7 premium SUV. Audi should get a lift from its broader product lineup as well as its sharper design, he said. Global sales of its Czech brand Skoda rose 11.7 percent to a record 550,000 vehicles, while Spanish entry-level brand Seat reversed its sales decline by delivering 430,000 vehicles to customers in 2006, up 1.9 percent. British luxury brand Bentley's deliveries rose 7.1 percent to a record 9,200 vehicles, while Italian sports car brand Lamborghini boosted sales 30.4 percent to a record 2,087 cars. The group delivered 47 Bugattis to customers last year, its first deliveries as part of the Volkswagen group. Volkswagen brand commercial vehicles deliveries rose 10 percent to an all-time best 442,000 vehicles.
