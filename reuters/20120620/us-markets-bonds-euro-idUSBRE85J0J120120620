 LONDON  (Reuters) - German Bund futures extended losses to hit session lows on Wednesday after Greek Socialist leader said a conservative-led government has been agreed and will form a team to "renegotiate" the EU/IMF bailout, saving the country from bankruptcy. 
 German Bund futures fell to 140.57, down 79 ticks on the day after the news. (Reporting by Emelia Sithole-Matarise; Editing by  Ana Nicolaci da Costa )
