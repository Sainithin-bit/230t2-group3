 ST PETERSBURG, Russia  (Reuters) - Russia's top crude producer Rosneft is looking into a possibility of entering the U.S. stock market, the company's influential Chief Executive Officer Igor Sechin said on Wednesday. 
 "We are studying a possibility and viability of entering the American (stock) market," Sechin told a shareholder who asked him about company's plans to increase its exposure to foreign stock markets. Sechin was speaking at an annual general meeting of Rosneft ( ROSNq.L ), which is already listed on the London Stock Exchange after a 2006 placement.
