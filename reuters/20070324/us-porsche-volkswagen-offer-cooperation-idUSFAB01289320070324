 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Volkswagen ( VOWG.DE ) welcomed the intention by its largest shareholder, Porsche ( PSHG_p.DE ), to increase its stake in Europe's largest carmaker further, VW said on Saturday. 

 "A stable shareholder structure is very important for the long-term-oriented automobile business," Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn said in a statement. "The increased stake serves also to further secure our cooperation on the basis of the current governing contract," he continued. Volkswagen said it would first comment on Porsche's planned takeover bid, and in particular on the price, once the offer has been submitted. Porsche expects to have to pay a legal minimum of 100.92 euros per ordinary share as part of a mandatory offer after it crosses the 30 percent threshold. Volkswagen shares closed on Friday at 117.70 euros.
