 (Reuters) - Luxury sports car maker Porsche ( PSHG_p.DE ) plans to boost its stake in larger German automaker Volkswagen ( VOWG.DE ) beyond 30 percent, triggering a mandatory takeover offer, but it does not intend to take majority control of VW, Porsche said on Saturday. 

 Here are some key facts about the two companies: Volkswagen, the world's fourth-largest carmaker, sold 5.7 million vehicles around the world last year, a gain of 10.2 percent despite fierce competition. The group includes the flagship Volkswagen marque; mass markets brands Seat and Skoda; premium brand Audi and luxury brands Bentley, Bugatti and Lamborghini. It employed nearly 325,000 staff at the end of last year. Volkswagen, which also makes commercial vehicles and provides financial services, had 2006 sales revenue of 104.88 billion euros ($139.8 billion) last year and a net profit of 2.75 billion. The group also owns a 29.9 percent stake in German truckmaker MAN ( MANG.DE ) and controls 35.3 percent of the votes in Scania ( SCVb.ST ) of Sweden. Porsche, maker of the renowned 911 sports car, sold nearly 97,000 vehicles in its latest fiscal year to July 2006, when it made a pretax profit of 2.11 billion euros on revenue of 7.27 billion euros. The company with the car industry's fattest profit margins employs around 11,400 workers. Porsche has said vehicle sales should remain steady in this fiscal year as it rolls out the next generation of its muscular Cayenne offroader. The next big boost in sales and profits is expected in 2009, when it launches its first four-door sports coupe, the Panamera.
