 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Chicago real estate magnate Sam Zell is offering to buy Tribune Co. TRB.N for $33 a share, the Los Angeles Times reported on its Web site on Friday, citing a source familiar with the matter. 

 The offer would be a $2.47 premium to the newspaper publisher and broadcaster's closing price of $30.53 on Friday. A special committee of directors that is reviewing options for Tribune received details of the proposal on Wednesday, the Times reported. Tribune has about 240.2 million shares outstanding, which would make the bid worth nearly $8 billion. Bankers working on the deal have many details to take care of, and the company may not be able to meet its March deadline to come up with a plan, the Times said, citing its source. A Tribune spokesman and a Zell spokeswoman declined to comment. A spokesman for the Chandler Trusts, Tribune's largest shareholder, also declined to comment. Tribune, which publishes the Los Angeles Times and the Chicago Tribune, and owns the Chicago Cubs and about two dozen television stations, has been evaluating several offers for all or parts of the company. It also has been considering whether to pay out a large dividend as well as take other action on its own rather than agreeing to a buyout, according to media reports. The company took this action to appease the Chandler family, which said it was angry over the company's falling share price.
