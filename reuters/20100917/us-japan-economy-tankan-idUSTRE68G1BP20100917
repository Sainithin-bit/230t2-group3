 TOKYO  (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan's closely watched tankan survey is likely to show confidence at Japanese firms improved for a sixth consecutive quarter as a recovery in exports slowly lifts corporate spending, a Reuters poll showed. 

 The September tankan is expected to show the sentiment index for big manufacturers improved 5 points to plus 6, the best reading in more than two years. The sentiment index for big non-manufacturers is seen improving to minus 2 from minus 5 in the previous tankan survey. The Reuters poll of 22 economists also shows they expect big manufacturers' mood to worsen to plus 1 and non-manufacturers' sentiment to deteriorate to minus 5 in December, partly because government subsidies on energy-efficient cars expire this month. Tokyo intervened in the currency market on September 15 by selling yen for the first time in more than six years as the yen's surge to a 15-year high versus the dollar threatened to derail Japan's economy and worsen deflation. Japanese business leaders praised the move, but it is uncertain if the September tankan will fully reflect intervention's impact on corporate sentiment. The tankan survey is being conducted from August 23 to September 28, but the preliminary deadline for replies was September 7, according to the BOJ. In past surveys, 70 to 80 percent of firms replied by the preliminary deadline, the central bank said. "It's too early to evaluate whether intervention is effective," said Masamichi Adachi, a senior economist at JPMorgan in Tokyo. "The outlook for the December tankan will deteriorate significantly due to the withdrawal of auto incentives. This will indicate a pause in the recovery, but not a double-dip recession." The BOJ's quarterly corporate survey for September is also expected to show big firms plan to increase capital spending by 4.2 percent for the fiscal year that started in April, an improvement over the previous tankan, which showed companies planned a 2.7 percent increase, when accounting methods for leasing are included. The central bank's next scheduled policy meeting is on October 4-5. Easing policy at this meeting cannot be ruled out, and options include increasing government bond purchases and expanding a cheap fund-supply tool, sources say. The BOJ has so far left the government's currency intervention unsterilized by allowing the yen selling to expand the money supply. The government is likely to explicitly pressure the central bank to continue unsterilization and ease policy in other ways to maximize the benefits of intervention. The tankan indexes are derived by subtracting the percentage of respondents who say conditions are poor from those who say they are good. Negative readings mean pessimists outnumber optimists. The monthly Reuters Tankan survey, which is closely correlated with the BOJ's tankan, showed manufacturing confidence dropped in September from August for the first time in nearly a year as firms struggled with the yen's rise. Still, the Reuters index has risen during the July-September quarter, suggesting the BOJ data due on out on September 29 will also show a rise. (Writing by Stanley White; Editing by  Michael Watson )
