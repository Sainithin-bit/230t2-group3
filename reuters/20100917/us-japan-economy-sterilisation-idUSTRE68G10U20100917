 TOKYO  (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan is expected to hold off draining yen funds that went into the currency market through Tokyo's yen-selling intervention, effectively expanding monetary easing at least in the short term. 

 Japan stepped into the market on Wednesday for the first time in six years, selling nearly 2 trillion yen ($23 billion) to stem a yen rise seen threatening a fragile economic recovery. The central bank is expected to hold off draining, or leaving unsterilized, most of that amount, boosting liquidity. Below are some questions and answers about sterilization -- or lack thereof -- of currency market intervention. IS INTERVENTION NEUTRAL FOR MONEY MARKETS? Not initially, but long term, yes. By law, the government has no right to print cash and has to fund its intervention by issuing financing bills (FBs), usually of three-month duration. It sets the intervention amount and the BOJ, which has the right to print cash, acts as its agent. Once the BOJ sells yen in the market it creates, in the absence of sterilization, an increase in liquidity until the Ministry of Finance issues its FBs to pay for the intervention. At that point, intervention is neutralized. But monetary conditions can stay expanded for some time if the size of intervention is huge because of the time it will take for markets to absorb the ministry's FB issuance. HAS BOJ LEFT INTERVENTION UNSTERILISED BEFORE? Yes. When Tokyo previously intervened in a 35-trillion-yen selling spree that ended in 2004, rates were already zero and the BOJ raised its liquidity target under a quantitative easing policy to accommodate the extra yen in the financial system. That was interpreted by markets as leaving intervention unsterilized and as helping to weaken the yen. But when the BOJ's policy rate was much higher, it used to absorb the extra cash from intervention to keep overnight call rates from falling below its target. IS UNSTERILISED INTERVENTION FEASIBLE NOW? Yes, to a certain extent. The BOJ will likely hold off on draining yen funds from intervention, allowing banks' current account deposits at the central bank to increase significantly. Unless intervention is excessively large, analyst estimate the central bank can leave the yen selling unsterilized without having to worry about the overnight call rate falling below its 0.1 percent target. That is because BOJ pays 0.1 percent interest to financial institutions that park excess reserves with it, effectively setting a floor for the overnight call rate. WOULD THE GOVERNMENT WELCOME UNSTERILISED INTERVENTION? Unsterilized intervention is a form of monetary easing in that it allows the amount of money in circulation to increase. But analysts say its effect on curbing yen rises and supporting the economy will be limited because policy rates are so low. Unsterilized intervention is more effective as a monetary tool when interest rates have room to fall. With the BOJ's policy rate near zero and even 10-year bond yields around just 1.0 percent, the extra money will likely accumulate in banks' reserves at the central bank. Corporate fund demand is so weak and rates so low that additional liquidity will make little difference, analysts say. The yen funds from unsterilized intervention will also pale in comparison to trillions of yen routinely going back and forth between government and commercial banks to settle tax and pension fund accounts. Still, it may help to weaken two- to five-year bond yields, which are most sensitive to monetary policy, and the yen near term by giving markets the impression that the BOJ will keep markets awash with extra cash.
