 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The White House declined to say on Friday whether Wall Street critic Elizabeth Warren would be a candidate to lead a new consumer financial protection agency after President Barack Obama chose her to oversee its establishment. 

 "She is focused on setting this up," spokesman Robert Gibbs said. Obama announced Warren not as head of the new agency, but as special adviser to oversee its establishment, allowing him to avoid a bitter Senate confirmation fight. Republicans accused him of circumventing congressional oversight, but Gibbs said the appointment was necessary to avoid a long delay in starting the agency. "We know from the appointments process that the Republicans in the Senate have virtually ground to a halt; nobody was going to be confirmed any time soon," Gibbs said at a daily news briefing. "What the president was focused on was how do you get this agency started, how do you get this agency started, so this made perfect sense," he said. "The president will nominate a director and Elizabeth will be instrumental in picking who that is," he added. Gibbs said the choice of a director would be made "over the course of the next several months." (Reporting by  Jeff Mason  and  Patricia Zengerle , editing by Leslie Adler)
