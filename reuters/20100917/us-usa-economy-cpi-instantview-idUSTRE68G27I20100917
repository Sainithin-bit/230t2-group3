 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Consumer prices increased slightly more than expected in August as food prices rebounded and energy costs remained elevated, but core prices were flat, a government report showed on Friday. 

 KEY POINTS: * The Labor Department said its seasonally adjusted consumer price index rose 0.3 percent after rising 0.3 percent in July. * Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast consumer prices gaining 0.2 percent last month. * In the 12 months to August, the CPI rose 1.1 percent after a 1.2 percent increase the prior month. * The increase was in line with market expectations COMMENTS: IAN LYNGEN, SENIOR GOVERNMENT BOND STRATEGIST, CRT CAPITAL GROUP, STAMFORD, CONNECTICUT: "CPI came in friendlier than expected on the core level, which is a surprise to us given fears of rents and autos. There is little we see in details to suggest this doesn't affirm the benign inflation picture. It's not enough for us to shift and call for QE next week, and we don't think the market's buying this idea. Rather, CPI comes as a sense of relief and note the market was bid prior to the release anyway." GUS FAUCHER, DIRECTOR OF MACROECONOMICS, MOODY'S ANALYTICS, WEST CHESTER, PENNSYLVANIA: "The concern is that the core number came in flat. That's worrisome. If core inflation comes in flat, the threat of deflation hasn't passed yet. "On the whole, the data looked a little better this week. We are still at a stage of the economy where there is growth but it's not strong enough to bring down unemployment. "This doesn't change our view about the chances of a double-dip recession, which is about one-in-three. It has moved up from one-in-four over the past six months." JOHN CANALLY, ECONOMIST/INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, LPL FINANCIAL, BOSTON: "This just gives the Fed room to do quantitative easing. There is no inflation. There is no deflation. It's disinflation. "This should put downward pressure on bond yields. This is good news for consumers and mortgage rates. "But if the yield curve is flattening, it signals the economy is weakening. The Fed will be speaking about this on Tuesday." BRIAN DOLAN, CHIEF CURRENCY STRATEGIST, FOREX.COM, BEDMINSTER, NEW JERSEY: "We have zero inflation, with the core number unchanged. Inflation is really not the issue for the U.S. economy at the moment. In fact, we have continued risk of deflation. We did see a dip in dollar/yen because yields were a touch lower, but we don't see this data having a sustained impact going forward." URI LANDESMAN, PRESIDENT, PLATINUM PARTNERS, NEW YORK: "Personally, I don't think this is a huge deal. This is a volatile data series. It's slightly higher than expectations, so maybe it's mildly positive. I think the market is more worried about deflation than inflation, so this could be a relief to those worried about deflation, but ultimately I wouldn't put too much stock in it. "In general, the market doing a lot better in September than I thought we would be doing, and that's because the data has been better than we thought it would be. I'm not declaring victory yet, but it is mildly encouraging. I was expecting a mild correction over the next two to three week, but that seems less and less likely." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stock index futures hold gains after consumer price index data. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices rise. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar little changed.
