 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co will offer an incentive plan in June on its F-Series pickup trucks to reduce inventories as the automaker prepares for a launch of redesigned models later this year. 

 Ford, like other major U.S. automakers, has tried to restrain incentives but has been forced to respond to sharp declines in demand for pickup trucks, including the F-Series, which have ranked as the most popular vehicles in the U.S. market for three decades. Ford's "employee pricing" incentive plan will allow customers to buy an F-150, F-250 or F-350 vehicle for the same price as the automaker's employees from June 3 to June 30, Ford marketing chief Jim Farley said on a monthly auto sales conference call. "We want the sell-down to go smoothly," Farley said. (Reporting by  David Bailey ; editing by John Wallace)
