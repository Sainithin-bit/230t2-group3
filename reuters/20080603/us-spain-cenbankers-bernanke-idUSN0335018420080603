 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Tuesday spoke via satellite to an economic conference of the International Monetary Conference in Barcelona, Spain. 

 Following are highlights from his speech: ON DOLLAR (from Q&A) "We do take note that a weaker dollar, all else equal, does have some inflationary impact and we are very cognizant of that and we want to pay close attention to that fact." "The weakening of the dollar has had some inflation impact and it has had some effect on commodity prices. I think overall the effect of the dollar on commodity prices is relatively modest. By far the strongest and most important factor in driving up commodity prices is global supply and demand conditions. In the case, for example, of oil, we have on the one hand emerging markets and other growing countries that are demanding energy and other raw materials. And on the supply side, we've had limitations to supply due to inadequate investment, inadequate technologies, geopolitical instability, and other factors. And so I do think that the supply and demand considerations are the strongest. You can see that ... in the last couple of months, as the oil price has shot up to a new level, above $130 (per barrel) at one point, the dollar itself has been pretty stable, policy rate expectations have gone up, other commodity prices have come down. And I think that generally illustrates the importance of supply and demand considerations in this case. It is also important, when you look at the relationship between the dollar and commodity prices, to recognize that there is two-way causality. Everything else equal, the decline in the dollar will cause an increase in commodity prices, essentially equal and opposite in terms of percentage changes. It will, by the way, also tend to reduce oil prices in terms of other currencies. But there is also a causality running in the other direction. The U.S. is a significant importer of oil. We have a current account and trade deficit. Much of the adjustment we've seen in the dollar since 2002 has been an unwinding of the appreciation prior to 2002, which was associated with the increase and now reduction in our trade deficit. To the extent that oil prices or other commodity prices rise for other reasons, supply and demand reasons, that will have an adverse effect, in the first instance, on the U.S. balance of trade, and will tend to be depreciating the dollar, as a commodity producer would have a stronger currency in the case of oil price increases. So I think it is a complex relationship." ON ASSET PRICE BUBBLES (from Q&A) "We do need to look and think about these issues quite seriously. I must say, although I retain a very open mind on the issue of monetary policy and its role in pricking bubbles ... I still remain somewhat skeptical about that feasibility. Doing that requires, again as many people have noted, first identifying the bubble at an early stage, which is always difficult; secondly, being surgical in your interest rate move that you attack only the bubble and not other asset prices, for example; third, assessing what the effect will be, whether the bubble declines slowly, whether it will pop with a bang, what the effect will be on the broader economy. It's a very blunt tool for addressing this problem. But, again, I think more thought is needed on this issue. I think there might be more potential going forward in using supervisory and regulatory policy to address these issues." ON SHOCKS TO ECONOMY, INFLATION (from Q&A) "The United States is facing terms of trade shocks on two dimensions. The first, as Jean-Claude remarked, is the change in commodity prices -- the change in the relative price to commodities relative to U.S. goods, services and wages. And that is a major shock both in terms of inflation impact but also in terms of real living standards and purchasing power of the U.S. consumer. That comes on top of a longer-term terms of trade adjustment, which again is the unwinding of the appreciation of the dollar in the late '90s, up to 2002, which is part of the process of restoring balance in the global current account situation. So we're dealing with a difficult terms of trade adjustment..." "I agree with Jean-Claude that while in the short term, or even within a year or two it can be difficult for the central bank to overcome some of these inflationary terms of trade shocks, that certainly in the medium term, 18 months, two years in the future, the central bank is the primary determinant of the inflation rate, and we will take responsibility for that, and it's the only way forward. In the short run, yes, it's going to be a problem for the U.S. economy, in both the real side and the inflation side. In the longer term, we are committed to price stability." ON RATE OUTLOOK AND THE DOLLAR (from prepared remarks) "For now, policy seems well positioned to promote moderate growth and price stability over time. We will, of course, be watching the evolving situation closely and are prepared to act as needed to meet our dual mandate. In collaboration with our colleagues at the Treasury, we continue to carefully monitor developments in foreign exchange markets. The challenges that our economy has faced over the past year or so have generated some downward pressures on the foreign exchange value of the dollar, which have contributed to the unwelcome rise in import prices and consumer price inflation. We are attentive to the implications of changes in the value of the dollar for inflation and inflation expectations and will continue to formulate policy to guard against risks to both parts of our dual mandate, including the risk of an erosion in longer-term inflation expectations. Over time, the Federal Reserve's commitment to both price stability and maximum sustainable employment and the underlying strengths of the U.S. economy -- including flexible markets and robust innovation and productivity -- will be key factors ensuring that the dollar remains a strong and stable currency."
