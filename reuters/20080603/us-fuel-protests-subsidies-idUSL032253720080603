 (Reuters) - Oil's rise to records above $130 a barrel has forced governments to risk public discontent and consider reforms to subsidies that are draining their coffers. 

 India, Asia's third largest oil consumer, will consider price rises on Wednesday. Here are some details of countries that have fuel subsidies: * MALAYSIA - Malaysia said on Tuesday it would scrap fuel price controls in August in a move that could double pump prices and stoke inflation already at 15- month highs. - If left unchanged, Malaysia's fuel subsidy system would cost the government as much as 56 billion ringgit ($14.74 billion), or about a third of government expenditure. * CHINA - China continues to extend oil subsidies to its top refiners to offset their processing losses. Asia's top refiner Sinopec Corp. received a 7.1 billion yuan ($1.02 billion) government subsidy in April 2008 and also 12.3 billion yuan ($1.77 billion) to offset refining losses. - The total fuel subsidy amounted to 2.9 percent of the government budget in 2005 and 0.1 percent in 2006. - China also extended a tax rebate of 75 percent on the 17 percent VAT for crude oil imports. INDIA - India said it may raise fuel prices on Wednesday to ease pressure on oil firms that have to pay international prices for the crude oil they buy. India has extended a subsidy of 39.8 billion rupees ($1 billion) to its largest oil retailer Indian Oil Corp. Other retailers HPCL and BPCL will receive 14.23 billion and 16.23 billion rupees, respectively. - The total subsidy amounts to 0.4 percent of the budget. INDONESIA - Indonesia has struggled to maintain its burgeoning fuel subsidy bill which stands at $4.89 billion. It is borne by the government and accounts for 12 percent of the total budget. EGYPT - Egyptian energy subsidies stand at 60 billion Egyptian pounds ($11.21 billion), up from 57 billion in 2007. Of the total, 20 billion Egyptian pounds $3.5 billion) a year was extended as gas subsidies to energy-intensive companies, which the government plans to phase out. THAILAND - Thailand has decided to extend subsidies by lowering fuel prices. The country's four state-run refineries will supply 122 million liters of diesel per month to bus operators at a discount of 3 baht (9.4 cents). This followed a one-day strike by operators and marked an about-face by Thailand, which has resisted resorting to wider fuel subsidies since scrapping them in 2005. BANGLADESH - Subsidies cost Bangladesh annually about $730 million. The subsidy amount is expected to increase to $1.5 billion if fuel prices are not hiked. CHILE - Chile announced fuel subsidies to the tune of $1 billion. MEXICO - Mexico has extended a $19 billion fuel subsidy to mitigate the effects of rising oil prices, four times more than 2007. It subsidizes prices by paying Pemex, a state monopoly, the difference between pump prices and what Pemex pays for imports. (Writing by Carl Bagh, Editing by David Cutler and  Janet McBride )
