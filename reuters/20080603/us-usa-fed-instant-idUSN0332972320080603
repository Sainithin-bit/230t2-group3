 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Tuesday issued a rare warning on the inflation risks posed by a weak U.S. dollar, but said U.S. interest rates were "well positioned" for an economy facing both price pressures and threats to economic growth.  

  COMMENTS: CHRIS JARVIS, SENIOR ANALYST, CAPROCK RISK MANAGEMENT, NEW  HAMPSHIRE: "Clearly the FOMC has walked a fine line with cutting interest rates to stem a financial collapse, while at the same time lowering rates weakened the dollar given the interest rate differentials, basically giving an all clear sign to sell dollars and buy commodities across the board." "Bernanke's language today, however, is intended to reverse a bit of this trade, which may indicate the worst is behind us with the credit crunch and his intentions now are to slowly take back some of this liquidity, albeit at a slow rate, to halt the dollar's slide." "In short, the commodity complex's all clear to buy signal has just been flicked off and I am sure traders are on high alert for a rebound in the dollar, a bearish event for commodities." OLIVIER JAKOB OF PETROMATRIX IN LONDON: "There are still further worries about demand destruction ... there is the expectation the CFTC is going to publish another statement today... that might curb speculation and lastly there is the rise of the dollar following Bernanke's comments." TONY CRESCENZI, CHIEF BOND MARKET STRATEGIST, MILLER, TABAK  & CO. IN NEW YORK: "The depth to which Bernanke discussed the dollar is extraordinary for a Fed chairman and the use of the expression 'we are attentive' was a direct salvo at speculators in the foreign exchange market. TIM EVANS, ENERGY ANALYST, CITI FUTURES PERSPECTIVE, NEW  YORK: "I really didn't see anything that is all that controversial ... basically it is a reminder that the Fed is still on the job." I think the price rise in crude oil has exaggerated quite a few fundamental conditions, the dollar just being part of that list". TOM BENTZ, ANALYST AT BNP PARIBAS COMMODITY FUTURES INC IN  NEW YORK: "The dollar is improving after the Bernanke news helped put some pressure on crude oil." ROBERT BERGQUIST, CHIEF ANALYST at SEB IN STOCKHOLM,  SWEDEN: "The strong dollar policy is normally communicated from the U.S. Treasury. Normally the Fed does not speak about the dollar, so this is quite unusual." "The market is interpreting this as meaning that the U.S. doesn't like the weakening of the U.S. dollar." TOM SOWANICK, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, CLEARBROOK  FINANCIALLLC, PRINCETON, NEW JERSEY: "Bernanke seems more concerned about inflation than growth and for the first time that I remember he brings the weak dollar into the macro picture by linking rising import costs -- inflationary -- to the front page. "Bernanke and other Fed officials have recently been talking about how rate cuts have positioned the economy for growth. Bernanke has pointed out that increase in raw material prices will be passed on -- inflationary -- and concerned about the weak dollar -- also inflationary. Those are two factors that could force a rate hike versus a weak housing market which would be only 1 vote for a rate cut. "All in all, I think that Bernanke is warning us that the next move by the Fed will be to hike rates and it may come much sooner than most are expecting. It's very hawkish of him and that's why the front-end of the Treasury curve is getting hit." CARY LEAHEY, SENIOR ECONOMIST AT DECISION ECONOMICS IN NEW  YORK: "What was really interesting was he mentioned the dollar drop for the first time spurring an unwelcome rise in import costs. You wouldn't make a lot out of that, other than if the Fed thinks that the labor market has stabilized, then the decline in the dollar will be another reason to hike rates. KIM RUPERT, MANAGING DIRECTOR OF GLOBAL FIXED INCOME  ANALYSISAT ACTION ECONOMICS LLC IN SAN FRANCISCO: "The most interesting comments of the bunch were on the dollar, where he said the Fed and Treasury are monitoring currencies closely. "Typically the Fed won't mention the dollar. This is why this is significant that he brought this into the picture." "Probably Bernanke and Paulson behind the scenes have said we cannot continue to allow the dollar to be bashed like this. Without actually hiking rates this is the most effective way that policy makers can give it some support -- just jawbone it a little bit better." VASSILY SEREBRIAKOV, CURRENCY STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO, NEW  YORK: "It's a fairly clear signal that rates are likely to remain on hold for the near term, probably as clear a signal as we've ever received from Bernanke. Also, he expressed more concern than usual for dollar weakness. His explicit mention of the dollar as far as inflation is concerned is unusual. "I think it would be a big stretch at this point (to talk about intervention). It's something that cannot be completely ruled out, but the probability is very low. There's a common G7 view on currencies' fair values."  JOSH STILES, BOND STRATEGIST AND MANAGING DIRECTOR WITH  IDEAGLOBAL IN NEW YORK: "He is highlighting the inflation risks from the weak dollar and import prices, but he is somewhat hopeful that commodities may end up moderating and that the slack in the economy will restrain inflation. He is seeing progress in credit markets, but not enough." "The bond market is dividing up between those who think he is wrong on growth and those who think he is wrong on inflation. I am saying he is going to be wrong on both. Inflation will be higher than he is expecting and we will face more weakness from the consumer than he is expecting." GARY THAYER, SENIOR ECONOMIST, WACHOVIA SECURITIES, ST.  LOUIS, MISSOURI: "They are making more explicit statements about the dollar which is a bit unusual. It's almost as if they are suggesting that they and the Treasury could intervene if the dollar got significantly weaker. But Bernanke is not suggesting that they would raise interest rates to defend the dollar because of the weakness in the housing market. He's focusing a little more on inflation than economic weakness by specifically highlighting the dollar. I think he is trying to draw more attention to the Fed's concern about inflation. But he doesn't want to imply that the economy is strong enough to allow the Fed to raise interest rates. STEPHEN MALYON, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST, SCOTIA CAPITAL,  TORONTO: "Bernanke appears to be spending some time talking about the weak dollar which suggests that policy makers have become more mindful of the potential link between the currency and high commodity prices and inflation. Otherwise he spends time talking about rising inflation expectations which are no doubt a rising concern following Friday's Michigan sentiment report."
