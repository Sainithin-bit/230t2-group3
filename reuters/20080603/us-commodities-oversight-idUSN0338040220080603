 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Tuesday announced proposals for more detailed reporting by index traders and swaps dealers in the commodity market and said it was investigating a sharp spike in cotton prices this year. 

 In addition the futures market regulator announced: * The withdrawal of proposals to increase speculative limits on some agricultural futures * It will issue a new monthly publication on trader data for agricultural and other markets from July * It will work with agriculture banks to provide credit to cover higher margins in futures markets * Plans a proposal to allow clearing of agricultural swaps * It will seek improvements in agricultural trade options program The following are reactions by traders and analysts: MICHAEL FRANKFURTER, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, MANAGED  ACCOUNT RESEARCH, INC, SANTA BARBARA, CAL: "Regardless of anyone's opinion as to commodity prices, there is a crisis of confidence in the commodity markets' price discovery mechanism. The financial industry, bona fide hedgers and regulators need to work together to restore confidence." "The genie is out of the bottle and securitized commodity vehicles are not going to go away. ANDY LEBOW, TRADER AT MF GLOBAL IN NEW YORK: "The latest CFTC move will lend more transparency to the futures markets." "I don't see it having that big an impact on prices." MIKE STEVENS, COTTON ANALYST FOR BROKERS SFS FUTURES IN  MANDEVILLE, LOUISIANA: "The culprit seems to be swap dealers, who had unlimited access to futures. The CFTC investigation makes everybody nervous, period." KEITH BROWN, PRESIDENT OF COMMODITY FIRM KEITH BROWN AND CO in MOULTRIE, GEORGIA "I think it's closing the barn door after the mule got out," adding that it is part of the reason why cotton and oil futures likely broke down on Tuesday. SHAWN MCCAMBRIDGE, ANALYST, PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL: "The transparency issues in grains were expected and the withdrawal of increased spec limits should have been expected given the current environment." "The margin issue just looks like an educational process they will undertake, something to help reassure bankers and the financial community that the hedgers positions are OK." "The area of agricultural swaps will be interesting. I think that is CFTC's solution to the hedging problem that's been talked about, but I don't know if everyone will go along with that." "I don't see anything earth shattering here, two-thirds of it was expected."
