 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Senate Banking Committee is planning to hold a hearing next Tuesday to examine underwriting practices at some of the top investment banks, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Tuesday. 

 The source said representatives from several firms including Merrill Lynch MER.N, Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ), Citigroup ( C.N ), UBS ( UBSN.VX ), Lehman Brothers LEH.N have been invited to testify. Participation by the Wall Street firms has not yet been confirmed. The committee, chaired by Connecticut Democrat Christopher Dodd, plans to explore how the underwriting process, considered the foundation for putting together deals and structured financing with credit rating agencies and other market participants, contributed to the credit crisis. A subcommittee on securities, insurance and investment, chaired by Rhode Island Democrat Jack Reed, also plans to hold a hearing two days later on June 12 to examine investment banks and structured finance, sources familiar with the matter said. Officials from the Securities and Exchange Commission and other agencies might testify at the subcommittee hearing, the sources said. The SEC is looking at the liquidity of investment banks it supervises and has pushed them to increase their capital and liquidity levels after Bear Stearns nearly collapsed. The agency monitors investment firms Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ), Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs as part of a program that enables the it to respond quickly to any financial or operational weakness. U.S. lawmakers remain concerned over how the investment banks should be regulated after the collapse of Bear Stearns BSC_pf.N.
