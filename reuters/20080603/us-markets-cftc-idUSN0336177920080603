 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. regulator of the futures markets planned to unveil on Tuesday its response to volatile commodity markets, including a March spike in cotton futures prices, said two officials. 

 Agricultural groups complained at a recent Commodity Futures Trading Commission forum that futures prices were out of line with cash prices. The CFTC has opened an investigation of cotton futures trading, and last week, announced an investigation into possible price manipulation and abuse in crude oil futures. Futures prices for crops like corn, wheat, soybeans and cotton have surged to record levels since 2005. Commodities have become an attractive alternative to equities. "I think it is expected, and justifiably so, that the commission will develop an official response to the volatility in these markets, the listening session we held in April and the many public comments we have received," said CFTC Commissioner Bart Chilton. A published report said the CFTC will demand more information about index funds, a leading source of an influx of money into the futures markets, and about participants in "swaps" that are hedged on the futures markets. The New York Times said on Tuesday the CFTC would revise its reports from July to present the information in a clearer format. The newspaper said the agency also would grant fewer waivers of speculative limits to index funds and would work with financial regulators to make more credit available in the farm economy. A CFTC spokesman declined to discuss the agency's proposal ahead of its formal release later in the day. The National Farmers Union said it was concerned about swaps and over the counter trading that escape regulatory attention. "They can't tell you how big a position a company has if you can't count it all," said NFU president Tom Buis. Ideas such as requiring index funds to provide more information seem "like baby steps," he said. Volatile futures prices and the flood of investment money into the market has prompted suspicion of speculators and attempts to manipulate prices. Those fears are expressed whenever the market goes through exceptional times, said one House Agriculture Committee staff worker. When concern was high a couple of years ago about the influence of investment funds, CFTC expanded its weekly Commitment of Traders report. Since January 5, 2007, the report has a supplement that shows positions held by index traders in 12 agricultural commodities. The supplemental report was launched as a two-year pilot program. An independent agency, CFTC was created in 1974 as the successor of Commodity Exchange Authority, which oversaw agricultural commodities, and was given jurisdiction over futures trading in all commodities.
