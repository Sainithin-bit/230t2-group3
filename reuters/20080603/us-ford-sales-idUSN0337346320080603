 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Tuesday that U.S. sales fell 16 percent in May, driven by steep declines in sales of large trucks and sport utility vehicles. 

 Sales fell to 217,998 vehicles in May from 259,470 a year earlier, including all of the automaker's brands, Ford said. Car sales rose 2.8 percent, while truck sales fell 25.8 percent. May had one extra selling day in 2008 compared with a year earlier.
