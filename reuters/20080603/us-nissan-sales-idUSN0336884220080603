 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Nissan North America Inc said on Tuesday that sales rose 4.4 percent on an adjusted basis in May overall from a year earlier, driven by demand for cars and crossovers. 

 Nissan-brand sales rose 5.7 percent in May, while sales of its luxury Infiniti brand fell 6 percent for the month, the automaker said. Combined U.S. sales for the brands rose to 100,874 vehicles in May, from 93,062 vehicles a year earlier. For the Nissan brand, sales of cars and small to mid-size crossovers spurred a more than 17 percent rise in sales from a year earlier, while truck sales fell 14 percent. Al Castignetti, vice president and general manager of the Nissan Division for Nissan North America, said consumer demand for smaller more fuel efficient vehicles drove sales in May. May had one additional selling day in 2008 compared with a year earlier. (Reporting by  David Bailey )
