 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. regulators announced several initiatives on Tuesday to assure smooth running of the commodity futures markets roiled by massive inflows of money, zooming prices and expensive margin calls to keep contracts alive. 

 Some agricultural groups have complained that futures prices were out of line with cash prices for major crops, reducing the price-hedging role of the markets. Repeated, large margin calls are a obstacle as well, they said. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission said it was "committed to ensuring that agricultural futures markets function properly in their risk-management and price discovery roles." It said it would take several steps for greater disclosure of activity in the markets. Last week, the CFTC disclosed an investigation into possible price manipulation in crude oil futures. On Tuesday, it confirmed an investigation of a spike in cotton futures prices in February and March that was followed by a slump. Futures prices for crops such as corn, wheat, soybeans and cotton have surged to record levels since 2005. Commodities have become an attractive alternative to equities. In a statement, the four CFTC commissioners announced: --withdrawal of proposed rulemaking that would have increased the speculative position limits for some agricultural futures. The agency said last week it will develop a proposal to require more detailed information on index traders and "swaps" dealers in futures markets. --it "will be cautious and guarded before granting additional exemptions" to speculative limits on contracts. --its staff will develop a proposal to allow clearing of agricultural swaps, which would provide farmers and grain merchandisers an additional way to manage prices. The CME Group Inc CME.N, the world's largest grain exchange, requested permission on April 22 to clear trades on over-the-counter grain swap contracts. --its staff will propose improvements to the current agricultural trade options program. --from July, it will produce a monthly report on trader data on agricultural and other markets as a way to provide greater transparency in the market. --they will work with the Federal Reserve Banks of Chicago and Kansas City, the Farm Credit Administration and other financial authorities to encourage more credit in the agricultural sector. In addition, CFTC said its agricultural advisory committee will study issues such as the role and size of over-the-counter agricultural swaps and how to improve "convergence" of futures and cash prices. "These moves are cosmetic and don't amount to much of anything," said John Bondurant, president of Bondurant Enterprises, a grain and cotton merchant in Memphis. Instead, he said CFTC needs "to put limits on index funds ... to make the playing field more or less even." The National Farmers Union said it was concerned about swaps and over-the-counter trading that escape regulatory attention. "They can't tell you how big a position a company has if you can't count it all," said NFU president Tom Buis. Ideas such as requiring index funds to provide more information seem "like baby steps," he said. Volatile futures prices and the flood of investment money into the market has prompted suspicion of speculators and attempts to manipulate prices. Those fears are expressed whenever the market goes through exceptional times, said one House Agriculture Committee staff worker. Two CFTC members, acting chairman Walt Lukken and commissioner Bart Chilton, are scheduled to testify before the Senate Agriculture Committee on Wednesday on nominations for new terms.
