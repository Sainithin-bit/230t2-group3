 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The following is a summary of recent comments by Fed policy-makers: 

 * Denotes 2008 voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets U.S. monetary policy. * FED CHAIRMAN BEN BERNANKE, JUNE 3: "For now, policy seems well positioned to promote moderate growth and price stability over time. We will, of course, be watching the evolving situation closely and are prepared to act as needed to meet our dual mandate. "In collaboration with our colleagues at the Treasury, we continue to carefully monitor developments in foreign exchange markets. The challenges that our economy has faced over the past year or so have generated some downward pressures on the foreign exchange value of the dollar, which have contributed to the unwelcome rise in import prices and consumer price inflation. We are attentive to the implications of changes in the value of the dollar for inflation and inflation expectations and will continue to formulate policy to guard against risks to both parts of our dual mandate, including the risk of an erosion in longer-term inflation expectations." ATLANTA FED PRESIDENT DENNIS LOCKHART, JUNE 2: "Our current stance of policy is ... appropriate, adequately balanced for the risks, and I feel that the policy perhaps needs some time to see the effects that we expect." "At the same time I would say ... there continues to be a lot of uncertainty. And because of that uncertainty, I think we have to be flexible at any given time to respond to developments." "Although conditions have improved on some fronts, I don't feel we can yet 'breathe easy.' The path of the economy is still enveloped in considerable uncertainty, and serious risks remain. BOSTON FED PRESIDENT ERIC ROSENGREN, MAY 30: "Falling housing prices continue to be a significant source of down-side risk to the economy," "Should the unemployment rate rise and housing prices continue to fall, financial stresses caused by the housing correction could well spread beyond the large banks involved in complex securitizations and the smaller banks with sizable portfolios of construction loans, to a larger set of financial institutions." * MINNEAPOLIS FED PRESIDENT GARY STERN, MAY 28: "Inflation expectations have remained reasonably well anchored so far, which is encouraging. But the key to maintaining low inflation and inflation expectations is likely to be the timeliness and magnitude of decisions we make to reverse course" on interest rate policy. "I am confident that we will conduct policy in an appropriate and timely manner." SAN FRANCISCO FED PRESIDENT JANET YELLEN, MAY 27: "This is not the 1970s, but we can't let it get to be the 1970s. Our behavior is critical to that. We have to be the barrier. At a time when commodity prices are rising as rapidly as they are, inflation is a concern." "I consider the current level of monetary accommodation to be appropriate. That, together with the fiscal package, should be sufficient to promote a step-up to moderate economic growth later this year." * FED GOVERNOR KEVIN WARSH, MAY 21: "Even if the economy were to weaken somewhat further, we should be inclined to resist expected, reflexive calls to trot out the (interest rate) hammer again. "Inflation has been elevated for some time, and prices of commodities are surging. I find these trends particularly vexing at a time when global demand growth, most likely, has slowed. "If the Fed were deemed too accommodative for too long, credibility could be undermined, threatening to create a persistent inflation problem that would have to be corrected, no doubt at great cost." * FED VICE CHAIRMAN DONALD KOHN, MAY 20: "With the information now in hand, it is my judgment that monetary policy appears to be appropriately calibrated for now to promote both rising employment and moderating inflation over the medium term. But a large measure of uncertainty surrounds that judgment and as the economy evolves, so will the appropriate stance of monetary policy." (Reporting by  Alister Bull ; Editing by Leslie Adler)
