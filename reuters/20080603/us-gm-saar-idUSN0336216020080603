 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp expects U.S. total industry vehicle sales to be in the mid-to-high 15 million unit range in 2008, Chief Operating Officer Fritz Henderson said on Tuesday. 

 The outlook includes about 200,000 medium and heavy duty trucks. The U.S. auto industry is facing significant headwinds due to high gasoline prices, Henderson said on a conference call, adding that U.S. consumers are moving toward smaller and more fuel-efficient vehicles and away from trucks. "The shift has actually accelerated as gas went above $4 (per gallon)," he said. (Reporting by  Poornima Gupta , editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
