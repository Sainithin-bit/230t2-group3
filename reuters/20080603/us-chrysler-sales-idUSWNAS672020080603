 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Chrysler LLC said on Tuesday its U.S. sales fell 25 percent in May from a year earlier on an unadjusted basis, under pressure from declining demand for large pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles. 

 Chrysler said its sales fell to 148,747 vehicles in May for its Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep brands, down from 199,393 a year earlier. Car sales fell 33 percent and truck sales fell 22 percent, it said. The company ended May with inventory of 412,009 vehicles, or a 75-day supply, down 14 percent from a year earlier. (Reporting by  David Bailey ; editing by John Wallace)
