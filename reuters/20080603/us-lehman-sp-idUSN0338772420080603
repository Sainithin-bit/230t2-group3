 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Lehman Brothers' LEH.N future debt rating will depend on its management's ability to address market concerns about its capital and liquidity position, a Standard & Poor's analyst said on Tuesday. 

 S&P on Monday cut Lehman Brothers' debt rating one notch to "A," the sixth-highest investment grade level, on a weaker earnings outlook. Now the rating agency will watch whether Wall Street's smallest surviving brokerage will be able to reassure investors it has enough capital, S&P analyst Diane Hinton said on a conference call. "Unfortunately we are in a market environment where sometimes perception becomes reality," Hinton said. "We believe there is increasing pressure on Lehman to address these concerns." Lehman Brothers stock fell to its lowest since the meltdown of Bear Stearns BSC.N in March and the cost to protect its debt against default rose on Tuesday on concerns it could need to raise more capital. The Wall Street Journal reported that the investment bank may need to raise up to $4 billion. A source familiar with the story told Reuters that Lehman had no need to raise capital and would only do so if the right market opportunity presented itself or if the firm thought it would help investor perceptions. Later on Tuesday Lehman denied financial market rumors it had accessed the Federal Reserve's discount window for capital. Lehman said it last accessed the Fed's primary dealer facility in mid-April for testing purposes only and that it ended its most recent quarter with more than $40 billion of liquidity. This helped Lehman stock to pare some earlier losses, though it still closed down more than 9 percent. Lehman's credit default swap spreads tightened to 250 basis points, or $250,000 per year to insure $10 million in debt, after rising as high as 285 basis points, an analyst said. Hinton said Lehman "does not have a capital issue at this point in time" because it has already raised $4 billion in capital. Regarding reports Tuesday that Lehman may raise additional capital, Hinton said, "from our point of view it's a good thing." "The success of Lehman's ability to manage through this will be key going forward in rating," Hinton said. Lehman's rating has a negative outlook, which indicates the likely direction of the rating over the next two years. Hinton also said the rating agency was "comforted" by the Fed's decision to provide funding to broker dealers. However, this was not an entirely mitigating factor for the industry because these funding facilities are temporary, she added. S&P on Monday also cut ratings on Merrill Lynch MER.N and Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) and said the outlook on most financial institutions was mostly negative.
