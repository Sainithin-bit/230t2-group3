 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co said on Tuesday its U.S. sales rose 11.3 percent in May after adjusting for the number of selling days, a gain that bucked a downtrend for the U.S. industry as a whole. 

 Honda, which has the most fuel-efficient line-up of any major manufacturer, said sales of its compact Civic sedan rose 28.3 percent to a record 53,299 in the month. Sales were adjusted for one more selling day last month than in May 2007, a measure of U.S. sales performance favored by most automakers.
