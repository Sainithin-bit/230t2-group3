 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp's decision to close its Oshawa truck assembly plant in Canada was driven by high gasoline prices and the "dramatic" consumer shift away from trucks in the United States, Troy Clarke, the automaker's North America chief said on Tuesday. 

 Clarke said the decline in U.S. sales of full-size pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles was "particularly brutal" in April and May. (Reporting by  Poornima Gupta , editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
