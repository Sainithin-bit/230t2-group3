 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Despite its best efforts to shrink its balance sheet and soothe an anxious market, Lehman Brothers LEH.N has little choice but to raise new capital. 

 Lehman shares have lost more than half of their value in the past year amid concern its primary mortgage and credit businesses are struggling. On Monday the stock sank after Standard & Poor's downgraded Lehman to single-A and warned the credit rating could be lowered if Lehman incurred big losses. Now there is growing consensus the bank needs to raise new equity capital, fueled in part by losses incurred as Lehman tries to shrink its balance sheet. "They're a big trading house that is reducing leverage, a big fixed-income underwriter amid a credit crunch and the largest surviving player in a mortgage business that has been damaged for years to come," said Bernstein Research analyst Brad Hintz, a former Lehman finance chief. The fourth-largest U.S. investment bank saw its shares sink as low as 13 percent Tuesday amid renewed questions about its financial health. The Wall Street Journal reported the bank needed to raise as much as $4 billion in capital to offset second-quarter losses that exceeded forecasts. Lehman is considering raising capital, a person familiar with the situation said, though this source denied Lehman needed to raise capital. Lehman declined to comment. (To see related story, double click on <ID:nBNG236497> ) Late Tuesday afternoon, Lehman said it finished the second quarter with more than $40 billion in liquidity and has not accessed the Federal Reserve's discount window since April. Its shares retraced its losses. The bank has been under scrutiny in recent weeks as David Einhorn, whose $6 billion hedge fund Greenlight Capital is shorting Lehman shares, accused the bank of low-balling write-downs. Last month he argued it needed to raise capital. "We believe Lehman needs to raise substantial capital regardless of market conditions in order to take its needed write-downs," Einhorn told Reuters Tuesday. After reporting a 57 percent drop in first quarter earnings, fueled by $4.7 billion in write-downs. Lehman told investors they would shrink a balance sheet that included $85 billion of hard-to-sell commercial real estate, mortgage securities and corporate loans. The bank has repeatedly assured investors it has plenty of capital and liquid cash. It recently raised $4 billion in preferred equity and $6 billion in long-term debt. Yet a key part of the plan, shedding assets instead of selling equity, may ultimately force Lehman to raise capital. "It is both easier and much safer to reduce leverage by increasing equity than by shedding assets in today's difficult market," Hintz said. Equity sales are bad news for existing investors, since it dilutes their share of a company's profit. Assuming a $4 billion raise, analysts said Lehman would boost shares outstanding by as much as 20 percent. Even so, some analysts contend that Lehman's problem isn't the balance sheet but the market's beliefs about the bank. Fox-Pitt Kelton analyst David Trone forecasts a second quarter loss of just $180 million after hedges designed to offset declines in other assets instead backfire. Trone also expects $1.5 billion in asset write-downs, the firm's smallest quarterly hit since the credit crunch began. And thanks to new accounting rules, Lehman may record a substantial gain from declines in its own debt. "There is no immediate need to raise new capital. The only reason to do so now is deal with perception," said Trone. "Of course, Bear Stearns didn't need to raise capital either, but it went out of business when the market panicked. Lehman wants to avoid a panic." (Additional reporting by  Elinor Comlay  and  Dan Wilchins  in New York, Tenzim Pema in Bangalore, editing by Leslie Gevirtz)
