 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The White House said on Tuesday that General Motors Corp's plan to close some of its plants shows that the U.S. auto industry is "adapting well" 

 and laying the groundwork for a recovery. "It's a sign that Detroit continues to adapt and evolve and address the change in consumer tastes and attitudes," White House spokeswoman Dana Perino told reporters after GM announced steps to cut jobs, costs and its exposure to slow-selling trucks and SUVs in response to a rise in gasoline prices. "They're adapting well and they'll make these changes and hopefully be able to pull themselves up out of what has been a rough several years," she added.
