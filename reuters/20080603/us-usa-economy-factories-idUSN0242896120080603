 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - New orders at U.S. factories rose unexpectedly in April, reflecting a surge in prices for food and petroleum that cut into demand for costlier items like cars and aircraft, government data showed on Tuesday. 

 The Commerce Department reported that orders rose 1.1 percent in April, well above the 0.1 percent decrease economists had forecast. An upward spike in petroleum and food prices helped drive an overall 2.8 percent rise in nondurable goods orders, a department official said. In particular, a $3.5 billion rise in petroleum refinery shipments, reflecting price increases over the month, helped drive up orders in this category. But that was offset by a 0.6 percent fall in orders for durable items meant to last three or more years, pointing to weak demand for these costlier items, the third time in the last four months orders fell. Economists had expected to see a 0.5 percent decline during the month. Even with the bigger-than-expected falloff in overall durable goods orders, there were some signs of life in the industrial sector. Excluding transportation-linked items like cars and aircraft, factory orders posted back-to-back 2.6 percent increases in March and April. Non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, which some economists view as a proxy for business investment, climbed by a steady 4 percent in April, slightly less than earlier reported, but still the strongest monthly gain since last December. "This is marked improvement from just a few months ago," said Tim Quinlan, economist at Wachovia in Charlotte, North Carolina, adding that new orders for computers and electronics are likely trending higher amid strong global demand. INVENTORIES FLAT In another sign of potential strength in months ahead, inventories were flat in April after building for several months in a row. That may leave more room for factories to keep producing to meet current demand. In this category, finished goods stocks fell 0.5 percent, but work in progress inventories inched up 0.1 percent and materials and supplies grew 0.3 percent. "This pattern could be suggesting that manufacturers are preparing to restock the supply chain," said Ken Mayland, an economist with ClearView Economics, near Cleveland, Ohio. While there were some inventory gains in categories like primary and fabricated metals, machinery and electrical equipment, a huge decrease in petroleum refinery inventories helped drive down nondurable goods stockpiles. Even so, economists said it is too soon to gauge whether this decline will weigh down economic growth during the second quarter. (Reporting by Joanne Morrison; editing by Gary Crosse)
