 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Walgreen Co ( WAG.N ), one of the largest U.S. drugstore chains, on Tuesday posted a 3.9 percent increase in sales at stores open at least a year, helped by strong sales of food and beverages. 

 The average estimate of two analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters was 3.9 percent. Prescription same-store sales rose 2.8 percent, while sales of general merchandise -- or front-end sales -- rose 6 percent at stores open at least a year. Aside from food and beverages, front-end sales were also helped by the recent switch of the allergy medicine Zyrtec to non-prescription status. Walgreen shares closed Monday at $36.11 on the New York Stock exchange. The stock is down 5.2 percent this year, compared with a 7.4 percent increase for rival CVS Caremark Corp ( CVS.N ).
