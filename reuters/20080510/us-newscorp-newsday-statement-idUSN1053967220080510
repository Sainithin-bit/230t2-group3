 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch's News Corp NWSa.N has withdrawn its bid to buy Tribune Co's Newsday newspaper, a spokesman said on Saturday. 

 The spokesman said the deal had become "uneconomical." Cablevision Systems Corp ( CVC.N ) earlier bid $650 million to buy the newspaper, topping two $580 million offers -- one from News Corp and one from New York Daily News publisher Mortimer Zuckerman.
