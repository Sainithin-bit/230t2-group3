 (Reuters) - Vodafone Group is a better way to invest in the performance of Verizon Wireless than Verizon Communications is, with a cheaper price and a larger dividend, Barron's said in its latest issue. 
 Barron's said Vodafone shares could provide a 35 percent annual total return over the next two years, including dividends. The publication also quoted investors saying Vodafone deserved a higher valuation because of its emerging-market exposure and better asset mix. (Reporting by  Ben Berkowitz )
