 HONOLULU  (Reuters) - President Barack Obama said on Sunday the vibrant Asia-Pacific region was "absolutely critical" to U.S. prosperity but growth needed to be balanced and sustainable. 
 At the start of a meeting with Asia Pacific leaders, Obama said their talks would focus on ways to foster green growth, to help small- and medium-sized companies export more goods and to promote market-based innovation policies.
