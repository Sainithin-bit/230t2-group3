 ABUJA  (Reuters) - Nigeria's state-oil company NNPC said on Sunday that two local firms had completed the purchase of 45 percent stakes in two onshore oil blocks, previously owned by Shell ( RDSa.L ), Total TOTFA.PA and Eni ( ENI.MI ). 
 First Hydrocarbon Nigeria, owned by Afren ( AFRE.L ), bought a 45 pct stake in OML 26, NNPC said in a statement. A consortium led by local firm Nestoil is buying the 45 pct stake in OML 42, the state-run firm said. (Reporting by Camillus Eboh; Writing by  Joe Brock )
