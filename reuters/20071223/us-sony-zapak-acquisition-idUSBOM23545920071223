 MUMBAI  (Reuters) - Sony Online Entertainment on Sunday denied an Indian media report that said Zapak Digital Entertainment Ltd, part of the Anil Ambani-led ADAG group, was buying Sony Online and said the company was not up for sale. 

 India's Economic Times, citing anonymous sources and an unnamed Zapak official, had earlier reported that Zapak was set to buy Sony Online for about $300 million. "Sony Online Entertainment is not for sale and the report that Zapak is purchasing Sony Online Entertainment is completely erroneous and false," a company spokesperson for San Diego-based Sony Online told Reuters over telephone. Sony Online is the game development and game publishing unit that is part of global electronics maker Sony Corp's group. (Reporting by Bharghavi Nagaraju; editing by Louise Heavens)
