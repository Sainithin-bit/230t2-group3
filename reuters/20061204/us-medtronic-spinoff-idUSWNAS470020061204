 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Medical device maker Medtronic Inc. ( MDT.N ) on Monday said it will spin off its market-leading external defibrillator business as it looks to focus its resources on high-growth treatments for chronic diseases. 

 The Emergency Response Systems Business will be spun off into an independent, publicly traded company to be called Physio-Control Inc. with estimated annual sales of $450 million, Medtronic said.
