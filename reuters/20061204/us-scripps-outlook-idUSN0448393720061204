 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - E.W. Scripps Co. ( SSP.N ) on Monday stood by its fourth-quarter earnings forecast and said it expects newspaper revenue in 2007 to increase by a low-single-digit percentage. 

 Scripps said profit growth will be limited in the first quarter, due in part to the absence of Olympics advertising on its TV stations. The company, which runs popular cable channels including the Food Network and Home & Garden Television, said revenue in the Scripps Networks division should grow 10 percent to 13 percent in 2007. The division's expenses were forecast to rise 8 percent to 10 percent, with programming accounting for most of the increase as Scripps tries to attract new viewers and takes advantage of growing consumer demand for Internet video. Scripps, which publishes newspapers such as the Rocky Mountain News in Denver, The Commercial Appeal in Memphis and the Treasure Coast newspapers along Florida's Atlantic Coast, said revenue from newspaper Internet enterprises would account for most of the expected rise in newspaper revenue next year. Like other publishers, Scripps is dealing with a migration of readers to the Internet and other media. The Scripps Interactive Media division should contribute profit of $80 million to $85 million next year, it said. The television station group's revenue is expected to fall by 3 percent to 5 percent in 2007 because of a drop in political advertising. The U.S. mid-term elections boosted such advertising this year. For the fourth quarter, Scripps repeated its previous forecast for earnings of 67 cents to 71 cents per share from continuing operations. Analysts polled by Reuters Estimates are expecting, on average, 70 cents a share. Scripps shares rose 31 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $49.42 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
