 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Underlying inflation has come down but the Federal Reserve must remain very vigilant about price pressures, Chicago Fed Bank President Michael Moskow said on Monday. 

 "Core inflation has come down and we are expecting it to decline slightly over the coming year and that is positive," he said in an interview on Web site CNBC.com. "But we have to be very vigilant about inflation." "We have to be very careful that inflation doesn't stay at elevated levels for an extended period of time because if it does, it gets built into inflation expectations." So far, inflation expectations have been contained, he added. The U.S. core consumer price index, which strips out food and energy costs, rose 0.1 percent in October from the previous month. Year-over-year, the index rose 2.7 percent, decelerating from 2.9 percent in the year through September. The core personal consumption expenditures index, the Fed's favored inflation gauge, was up 2.4 percent in October from a year ago, the same as in September. Moskow said the economy remained solid despite weak data recently. A report on Friday showing a surprise contraction in factory activity last month reinforced those who believe the Fed would soon have to ease rates to bolster growth. The Institute for Supply Management's index of national factory activity dropped to 49.5 in November from 51.2 in October. A reading below 50 indicates contraction -- the first time the manufacturing gauge was below that level since April 2003. Asked whether his view on the economy had changed, Moskow said: "The broad trend of the economy, there is a lot of strength there. Employment is strong, the unemployment rate is low, productivity is high, incomes are high ... overall, I think the economy is solid." NO SPILLOVER YET Moskow said the recent weakness was primarily concentrated in the housing and auto sectors, and there had yet to be any spillover from the housing sector slump. He forecast the economy would start out below its potential rate of 3 percent growth at the start of 2007 but pick up later in the year, with the unemployment rate below 5 percent by the end of next year. Moskow offered cautious comments on the seemingly growing divergence in views between the Fed and financial markets. The Fed continues to say risks are tilted toward inflation whereas the markets expect rate cuts next year. "I would not try to guess what the bond market is saying ... I don't think anyone knows precisely," he said, adding it was impossible to predict what the Fed would do in the future. Asked about the dollar, which has fallen sharply against major currencies this past week, Moskow said inflation forecasts would be influenced by the value of the dollar. "We all know what the impact on inflation will be from a weaker dollar or a stronger dollar in terms of inflation," he said. "So we clearly take this into account in our forecasts for inflation going forward and we monitor it very carefully." Moskow reiterated that job increases of about 100,000 per month will become standard as potential growth slows. U.S. nonfarm payrolls for November are due on Friday, with markets expecting the creation of about 110,000 jobs, according to a Reuters poll. (Additional reporting by  Kevin Plumberg )
