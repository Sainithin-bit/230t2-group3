 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Walgreen Co. ( WAG.N ) on Monday posted a greater-than-expected 9.3 percent rise in sales at stores open at least a year in November, sending its shares up more than 3 percent. 

 The increase came as sales of prescription medications rose despite a $4 generic drug plan in place at Wal-Mart Stores Inc.( WMT.N ) and other low-priced chains and in the wake of an 8.4 percent increase for rival CVS Corp. ( CVS.N ). This could reinforce analysts' perceptions that the Wal-Mart plan will not have a big impact on large drugstore chains, which focus on convenient locations and services. "While it may be good for Wal-Mart and Wal-Mart customers, it is not impacting Walgreen," Andrew Wolf, analyst at BB&T Capital Markets, said. Analysts, on average, had expected the largest U.S. drugstore chain by revenue to post a 9.1 percent rise in same-store sales, according to research firm Retail Metrics. Total sales rose 16.2 percent to $4.36 billion. Pharmacy same-store sales rose 11.4 percent, while same-store sales of general, or front-end, merchandise rose 5.7 percent. Prescription sales accounted for 64.5 percent of sales in the month, Deerfield, Illinois-based Walgreen said. For the company's fiscal first quarter, sales rose 16.6 percent to $12.71 billion. Analysts on average had forecast $12.48 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Walgreen sales have been stronger in the second half of 2006 than the first six months, the opposite of most of the retail industry, Wolf said. But the stock has been hammered since Wal-Mart in September started rolling out a plan to fill monthly prescriptions for some generic drugs for $4. Before Monday's sales report, Walgreen's stock was down 19 percent. "You've got a complete disconnect between the stock performance and the company performance," Wolf said. Walgreen has higher annual sales than CVS, but it operates fewer stores. CVS ran 6,197 stores as of November 25, while Walgreen had 5,515 stores as of October 31. Neither chain has matched Wal-Mart's low-price prescription plan. Walgreen shares rose $1.82 to $42.09 on Monday on the New York Stock Exchange. (Additional reporting by  Jessica Wohl )
