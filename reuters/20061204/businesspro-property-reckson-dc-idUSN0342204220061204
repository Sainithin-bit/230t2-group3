 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - New York real estate magnate Harry 
Macklowe backed away from a bid for Reckson Associates Realty 
Corp. RA.N, leaving former partner Carl Icahn alone to pursue 
an offer for the commercial real estate firm, a source familiar 
with the situation said on Sunday. 

  The reason Macklowe abandoned the bidding partnership was 
not immediately known, the source said. Icahn still plans to 
pursue the offer, the source said.  Reckson, a real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns 
office buildings in New York City and its suburbs, declined to 
comment. Icahn and Macklowe could not be immediately reached 
for comment.  Icahn and Macklowe had formed Rome Acquisition L.P. to 
pursue an $4.6 billion acquisition of Reckson, which previously 
agreed to be bought by SL Green Realty Corp. ( SLG.N ) for about 
$3.99 billion.  Macklowe's move to abandon the bid followed a decision by 
Mack-Cali Realty Corp. ( CLI.N ) on Saturday to drop out of the 
Rome Acquisition bidding partnership. Mack-Cali had previously 
agreed to contribute $400 million in cash to the deal.  Shareholders of Reckson, which owns 101 properties in New 
York City, its suburbs and in New Jersey, are scheduled to vote 
on SL Green's offer on December 6.  Reckson said on Saturday that Rome Acquisition still had 
not shown any documentation on its financing arrangements and 
had not responded to requests for information regarding a 
number of outstanding financial, legal and structural issues on 
its proposal.  Reckson also said Rome Acquisition had not made a firm 
proposal to acquire Reckson. Rome Acquisition previously said 
it would deliver a definitive offer by Monday. Reckson said 
Saturday that it continued to remain subject to a binding 
merger agreement with SL Green.
