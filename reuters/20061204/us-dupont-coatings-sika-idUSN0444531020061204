 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Chemicals maker DuPont Co. said on Monday it would sell its protective coatings product lines and related assets to Swiss chemicals firm Sika AG. 

 Financial terms of the sale were not disclosed. The protective coatings business makes products designed to protect concrete, steel and other materials from corrosion, water, fire and environmental forces, DuPont said in a statement. Sika will buy products sold under a number of brands including Permacor, Unitherm and Betonol as well as DuPont's manufacturing site at Vaihinger, Germany, where the coatings are made. DuPont said the sale was part of a strategy it announced in March to focus its performance coatings business more effectively on global growth.
