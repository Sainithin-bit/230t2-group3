 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The safety concerns that doomed an experimental Pfizer Inc. ( PFE.N ) cholesterol drug will lead to more U.S. scrutiny of similar medicines in development, a top Food and Drug Administration official said on Monday. 

 "The products in development from Pfizer and other companies in the same class are going to receive more scrutiny," Dr. Steven Galson, director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, told reporters. Pfizer said on Saturday it was scrapping development of the cholesterol drug torcetrapib, its most important experimental medicine, because of increased deaths and heart problems among patients who took the product in a late-stage trial. Galson said the FDA would comb through Pfizer's data to try to determine why patients who took torcetrapib fared worse. "We really have to look at what caused this increase in mortality. It apparently wasn't one particular cause of death," he said. Torcetrapib is part of a class of drugs called CETP inhibitors, which are designed to raise HDL or "good" cholesterol in the blood. Roche ( ROG.VX ), Merck ( MRK.N ), AstraZeneca Plc ( AZN.L ) ( AZN.N ) and Bayer BAYG.DE are developing medicines in the same family, but none is as far along in testing as torcetrapib. While it is too early to describe the risks of the other drugs, it is possible they may not have the same dangers as the Pfizer medicine, Galson said, comparing the class to the widely used statin cholesterol drugs that lower LDL or "bad" cholesterol. "Like statins, they are all in one class, but they are very different. They have different interactions. They have different potencies. It may be a situation like this where the next one that comes along won't have this problem," he said.
