 BOSTON  (Reuters) - The investment services industry got a jolt on Monday when former competitors Bank of New York Co. Inc ( BK.N ) and Mellon Financial Corp. MEL.N agreed to merge, sparking what analysts said is sure to be a new wave of takeovers in the months ahead. 

 "The likelihood that State Street Corp. ( STT.N ) and Northern Trust Corp. ( NTRS.O ) will do something has now been heightened," said Richard Bove, an analyst at Punk, Ziegel & Co. With $16.6 trillion in assets under administration, the combined Bank of New York Mellon would skip ahead in the unglamorous business of tracking trades, holding trillions of dollars in securities in custody and calculating the bulk of mutual fund prices that national newspapers print daily. The work itself may not set hearts racing, but is critical to anyone who buys and sells stocks and has become a hotly contested field, especially in Asian and African markets where investment management is now expanding. Companies that provide asset services -- the group also includes Citigroup Inc. ( C.N ) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. ( JPM.N ) -- all rely heavily on computers and there is not much difference in the prices they can charge. But access to foreign markets is more difficult and expensive and that is where any of them can pull in new customers. "JPMorgan and Citi have indicated a desire to expand and there will conversations, at least," Punk's Bove said. Boston-based State Street, which trails JPMorgan and Bank of New York slightly in custody assets, plans to earn at least half of its revenue abroad, Chief Executive Ron Logue has said. "State Street is still the big man on campus ... but I would say that Ron Logue may be sweating a little more today," said Louis Harvey, president of industry research firm Dalbar Inc. Others may also be flipping through their Rolodexes as they contemplate what to do next. "It puts more pressure on Citigroup's sub-scale presence in this business and encourages Citi to sell or to double up, and there are not many places to double up," said Charles Bralver, executive director at consultant Mercer Oliver Wyman. Bralver said the deal may also "make someone else think about biting the bullet to buy Northern Trust. Executives at Bank of New York and Mellon suggested they will be too busy with their own merger to worry about others for now, but analysts speculated more might eventually happen. "I would think that Bank of New York is not done here," Dalbar's Harvey said. He said both firms are generating enough cash to fund further acquisitions and said smaller rivals might be eager to line up with a new industry leader. The new linkup may also hasten a wave of consolidation in the $10 trillion mutual fund industry. Bank of New York Mellon will rank 10th in asset management, including Mellon's Dreyfus fund division. Indeed, Bank of New York Chief Executive Thomas Renyi said he proposed the merger to Mellon's Chief Executive Robert Kelly after Mellon executives had suggested interest in buying an asset management firm earlier this fall when Boston-based Putnam Investments and MFS Investment Management were both up for sale.
