 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Billionaire financier Carl Icahn charged ahead on Monday with a $49 per share offer for New York office landlord Reckson Associates Realty Corp. RA.N although his two partners withdrew from the bidding. 

 But instead of all cash, the new offer comes in the form of cash and units of American Real Estate Partners LP ( ACP.N ), which is 90 percent owned by Icahn. Icahn's current offer is valued at roughly $4.3 billion. In a letter to Reckson's lead director Peter Quick, American Real Estate Partners, which owns real estate, gaming, textiles, and other businesses, proposed paying about $1 billion in cash and $3.3 billion in a new class of preferred units, convertible into depositary units. "Obviously, the idea that more cash was on the table, was a better deal," said Joseph Betlej, real estate securities portfolio manager of Advantus Capital Management. "If it's convertible into a stock that is 90 percent controlled by Icahn, that would be a cloud over that stock." Reckson shares fell as much as 5.8 percent on Monday. Icahn first made an all-cash bid with then-partner Macklowe Associates for Reckson about two weeks before Reckson shareholders were set to vote on an offer from SL Green Realty Corp.( SLG.N ). The Reckson board had already approved the offer from SL Green, which owns office buildings, primarily in Manhattan. The Reckson shareholder vote on the SL Green offer was postponed twice. Meanwhile, the Icahn group added another partner, real estate investment trust Mack-Cali Realty Corp.( CLI.N ), late last week. But the partnership and the all-cash deal unraveled over the weekend, with Mack-Cali pulling out on Saturday and Macklowe following on Sunday. Mack-Cali said it dropped out of the bid because the acquisition would not have been in its shareholders' best interest. Calls to Macklowe Associates, which owned or controlled 3.9 percent of Reckson at the end of last month, were not returned. Mack-Cali, which owns office properties primarily in New Jersey, is unrelated to Macklowe Associates, the Manhattan office owner and developer headed by Harry Macklowe. Icahn's new offer is about three-quarters stock and one-quarter cash, while SL Green's offer is about three-quarters cash and one-quarter stock. "Simply the idea if I have stock that is very well dispersed and very liquid versus one that doesn't have a tremendous amount of liquidity to it, there is some difference of value on the table there," said Betlej of Advantus, which no longer owns Reckson shares but does hold SL Green shares. As of the end of last month, Icahn owned or controlled 4.2 percent of Reckson. Based on SL Green's trading price of $133.68, SL Green has offered to pay Reckson shareholders about $45.57 per share in cash and stock, or roughly $4 billion. Its deal includes about $2.8 billion in cash. Some shareholders have objected to SL Green's deal because it calls for a group led by Reckson's chief executive to buy most of the company's suburban holdings for $2.1 billion. Should its bid be accepted, American Real Estate Partners through Reckson would have to pay a $99.8 million break-up fee to rival suitor SL Green. "There are a number of uncertainties and potential contingencies associated with the letter it just received that will need to be further evaluated," Reckson said in a statement. On Monday, Icahn said he would submit a definitive bid on Tuesday, a day later than he had previously stated. Reckson shareholders are scheduled to vote on the SL Green offer on Wednesday, December 6. The successful buyer would also assume $2 billion of Reckson debt. SL Green, which last month said it would not match Icahn's offer, on Monday announced several unrelated deals boosting investment in Manhattan office properties and increased its quarterly dividend by 10 percent. Reckson shares were down $2.36 or 4.9 percent to $45.73 on the New York Stock Exchange after trading as low as $45.30 earlier. SL Green stock was off $1.25, about 0.9 percent, to $133.70. American Realty was up 1.5 percent, or $1.24, to  $81.60. (Additional reporting by  Scott Malone  and Nick Zieminski)
