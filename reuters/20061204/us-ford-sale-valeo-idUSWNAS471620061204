 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co. said on Monday it had reached a preliminary agreement to sell its Automotive Components Holdings (ACH) unit's climate-control business to French car parts maker Valeo. 

 The two companies signed a memorandum of understanding for the sale, which includes a factory in Plymouth Township, Michigan, that makes air conditioning units and radiators for a number of Ford vehicles. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. ACH is a Ford-managed holding company formed in October 2005 when Ford took back 23 facilities from struggling former parts subsidiary Visteon Corp. This is the first divestiture by Ford of facilities that were taken back as part of a bail-out of Visteon. Ford, struggling with falling U.S. market share and rising costs, plans to sell or close all ACH facilities by the end of 2008 as part of its restructuring plan that aims to return the automaker's North American unit to profit. Ford said the memorandum paves the way for the climate control business sale to Valeo but the final deal is contingent on reaching an agreement with the United Auto Workers union. Valeo said ACH's climate control business has forecast sales in 2006 of about $450 million. ACH spokeswoman Della DiPietro said Valeo would be a Ford supplier and the deal includes an agreement on future business. The Michigan plant employs about 1,250 people, including about 1,000 unionized workers. Ford shares closed down 15 cents at $7.89 on Monday on the New York Stock Exchange.
