 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Walgreen Co. ( WAG.N ) on Monday posted a 9.3 percent rise in sales at stores open at least a year in November as sales of prescription medications rose despite the $4 generic plan in place at Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) and other low-priced chains. 

 Analysts, on average, had expected the largest U.S. drugstore chain by revenue to post a 9.1 percent rise in same-store sales, according to research firm Retail Metrics. Total sales rose 16.2 percent to $4.36 billion. Pharmacy same-store sales rose 11.4 percent, while same-store sales of general, or front-end, merchandise rose 5.7 percent. Prescription sales accounted for 64.5 percent of sales in the month, Deerfield, Illinois-based Walgreen said. For the company's fiscal first quarter, sales rose 16.6 percent to $12.71 billion. Analysts on average had forecast $12.48 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Walgreen has higher annual sales than rival CVS Corp. ( CVS.N ), but fewer stores. CVS operated 6,197 stores as of November 25, while Walgreen had 5,515 stores as of October 31. Neither chain has matched Wal-Mart's plan to fill prescriptions for some generic drugs for $4, which the world's largest retailer started rolling out in September.
