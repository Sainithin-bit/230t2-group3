  (Recasts with quotes on dollar) 

  By  Tim Hepher PARIS  Dec 4 (Reuters) - Airbus launched a preemptive
strike against Boeing Co. ( BA.N ) over subsidies as it drew a
veil over funding of its re-engineered mid-sized A350 on Monday
and accused Washington of pursuing a weak-dollar policy.  Keen to avoid fueling a transatlantic dispute over aircraft
aid, the European plane maker refused to say if it would apply
for government development loans for the 10-billion-euro
($13.3-billion) jet, but said nothing had been ruled out.  Airbus and Boeing often snipe about funding, but Monday's
presentation on the new A350 represented a step-up in rhetoric
from the subsidiary of European aerospace group EADS ( EAD.PA ).  "We are not in a defensive attitude. We are clearly in an
offensive attitude on the heavily subsidized (Boeing) 787,"
Airbus President and Chief Executive Louis Gallois said.  Gallois accused Washington also of pursuing a weak-dollar
policy, posing problems for Airbus which prices its planes in
dollars but only has half its costs in the U.S. currency.  The dollar is trading at $1.33 per euro and currency hedges
that Airbus has in place at $1.12 are due to run out in 2009.  The dollar problem for Airbus has "taken on a completely
new dimension because of the United States' deliberate
weak-dollar policy," Gallois told LCI television.  Airbus did not rule out a capital increase to help fund the
A350 project, which overlaps with costly delays to its A380
superjumbo.  "We are discussing with governments future R&D funding, but
other options are on the table," Airbus President and Chief
Executive Louis Gallois said. "We have no imminent (cash)
needs. We are only asking for a level playing field. No
decision has been taken or is imminent."  Boeing contends that the traditional practice of funding
Airbus projects with development loans from the four
governments that support Airbus -- Britain, France, Germany and
Spain -- violates international standards on hidden subsidies.  Washington supports Boeing's case and has launched what
could become the largest trade dispute at the World Trade
Organisation, matched by a European Union counter-suit.  Airbus says Boeing benefits from more than $3 billion in
tax breaks from Washington state and fat defense contracts from
the U.S. government that reduce its costs on civil aircraft
development. Boeing denies receiving government assistance.  As for alternative financing methods, the French
government, which owns 15 percent of EADS, said it did not
exclude taking part in a capital increase.  Such talk comes at an uncomfortable time for EADS' top
shareholder, DaimlerChrysler AG DCXGn.DE, which wants to cut
its 22.5 percent stake to 15 percent. It is in talks with
German banks about transferring the shares. A German government
spokesman said talks on finding EADS investors were ongoing.  EADS shares closed 1.2 percent higher at 23.15 euros.  COMMERCIAL DOGFIGHT  Monday's A350 launch signaled the start in earnest of a
commercial dogfight between Airbus and Boeing in the world's
$50-billion aircraft market, which saw record sales last year.  Boeing was first to spot opportunities for long-range
aircraft with 200 to 350 seats, as Airbus turned its back on
the mid-sized market to bet on size with the A380. Airbus then
came up with a cheaper A350 design that sold poorly.  Airbus responded in July by abandoning a 30-year-old
fuselage for a wider shell. Its new A350 XWB (extra wide body)
will enter service in 2013, a year later than it said in July.
It aims to leapfrog the 787 by targeting Boeing's recently
built 777-300ER, which has a $40-billion order backlog.  Airbus recognizes it has catching up to do, as the 787
outsold its previous A350 by more than four to one.  Airbus sales chief John Leahy said while Boeing had an edge
in the first wave of old jet replacements, which make up 35
percent of demand, Airbus will be ready a second wave in 2013.  Airbus is delivering three models of the A350 -- starting
with a 314-seat version in 2013, followed by a 270-seat version
in 2014 and a 350-seat 777-challenger in 2015.  The 787 comes to market about five years before in two main
versions -- the 210-250-seat 787-8 and the 250-290-seat 787-9.  Both the Airbus and Boeing planes are twinjets designed
with fuel-saving material for long trips like Paris-Singapore.  Airbus said its A380 project, hit by costly delays due to
wiring installation problems that led to a huge profit warning,
was making progress even though the situation remains "tense."  The future of a freight version of the A380 was left
hanging by a thread after U.S. leasing company ILFC switched an
order for five freighters to five passenger versions. That left
United Parcel Service Inc. ( UPS.N ) as the freight version's
only customer after rival FedEx Corp. ( FDX.N ) canceled.
