 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The dollar edged up against most major currencies on Monday as investors took profits following a dollar decline that has shaved some 3 percent off its value in less than two weeks. 

 Coming into the week, the dollar had tumbled to a 20-month low versus the euro and a 14-year trough against sterling as weak data fanned fears U.S. interest rates could soon fall even as euro zone and U.K. rates were headed higher. But the dollar's decline was so swift -- it broke below $1.30 per euro on November 24 for the first time since April 2005 and last week breached $1.33 -- that analysts started calling the sell-off overdone, sparking a round of profit-taking that began in European trade. "The market is cutting some of the bleeding on the dollar," said Brian Taylor, chief currency trader at Manufacturers and Traders Bank in Buffalo, New York. "We are far from seeing real demand for the buck, but maybe we went too far too fast and now we needed a pause." By midafternoon in New York, the euro traded down 0.15 percent to $1.3317, off an earlier 20-month low of $1.3367  EUR= . The euro hit a record high above 154.10 yen EURJPY= before falling back to 153.70. The dollar was steady at 115.42 yen  JPY=  after hitting a four-month low below 115 on Friday. The U.S. economic calendar was light on Monday, with only a report showing pending U.S. home sales down 1.7 percent in October, though still above the low hit in July. That left investors looking ahead to interest rate decisions from the European Central Bank and Bank of England on Thursday and the U.S. November jobs report on Friday. Matt Kassel, director of foreign exchange at ING Capital Markets, said "the bulk of the profit-taking" will take place in the coming days ahead of the ECB decision. "It will have nothing to do with any news or data that's dollar-bullish," he said, calling it instead position-squaring ahead of an expected ECB rate hike to 3.50 percent. He said the overall mood remains decidedly dollar-bearish, especially after a report on Friday showed U.S. manufacturing contracted in November for the first time in 3-1/2 years. That, coupled with recent soft housing data, boosted expectations that the Federal Reserve might need to cut interest rates next year to help the slowing economy. On Monday, Chicago Fed President Michael Moskow told CNBC.com he expects U.S. economic growth to be below trend, and that expectations for inflation have been contained. The ECB is expected to lift rates to 3.5 percent on Thursday, which has helped boost the euro to within 3 cents of its record high against the dollar and to a record peak versus the yen. Some predict the ECB will further tighten monetary policy in early 2007, though the recent surge in the euro has slightly dampened this view. The Bank of England also meets on Thursday, though Kassel said it will probably hold rates steady while sounding hawkish about future inflation risks. Sterling was off last week's 14-year high against the dollar, trading down 0.1 percent at $1.9777  GBP= . (Additional reporting by  Vivianne Rodrigues  in New York)
