 (Reuters) - The fall in the value of the dollar against other major currencies has eroded revenues of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and increased the purchasing power of some non-U.S. economies. 

 The dollar's dive to a series of 20-month lows against the euro has helped to drive buying across the commodities complex as funds and other investors view dollar assets as relatively cheap. Since August 1 when U.S. oil prices were trading at $74.91, close to the record of $78.40 hit in July, dollar-denominated oil prices have fallen by 15.3 percent, while in euro terms they have fallen by 18.5 percent. Against the Japanese yen, they have only decreased by 14.7 percent. Qatari Oil Minister Abdullah al-Attiyah said on Monday OPEC was concerned about dollar weakness and the issue would be raised at the group's December 14 meeting. OPEC previously voiced concern about the impact of a falling dollar in late 2003 and early 2004 and said it justified supporting higher oil prices, but that was when U.S. crude was trading in the $30s. This time OPEC could be more worried about the forecasts of U.S. economic weakness that have contributed to the dollar's slide. Some analysts have said OPEC would be well advised to accept reduced earnings rather than risk destroying demand in the world's biggest oil consumer. "Maybe OPEC would be better off living with a temporary soft patch," said Harry Tchilinguirian of BNP Paribas. He said a weak dollar could be spurring demand. "The weaker dollar is essentially producing good value for crude. Depending on your storage, you can buy crude now and store it. That's from the physical side," he said. "On the paper side, maybe at the margins, someone will buy a little bit more." The following is a table of the U.S. crude price in dollars, yen and euros.
