 LONDON  (Reuters) - EMI Group Plc EMI.L is expected to reject a potential 2.5 billion pound ($4.92 billion) bid from private equity firm Permira as being too low, the Times newspaper said on Monday. 

 Permira could make an offer of 310 pence per share within days, but the music company, home to the likes of Kylie Minogue, Robbie Williams and Cold Play, is thought to want at least 350 pence per share, the newspaper said in an unsourced report. EMI said last Tuesday it had received a bid approach and a source familiar with the situation said private equity firm Permira had made contact with the music company. A comment was not immediately available from EMI. Shares in the company ended last week at 290 pence.
