 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Mellon Financial Corp. MEL.N, which agreed to a $16.5-billion takeover by Bank of New York Co. ( BK.N ), is moving quickly to mollify its Pittsburgh hometown over the loss of jobs and a storied name in finance. 

 Some of Mellon's 6,100 employees in the area may lose their jobs "in the short run," Mellon said on Monday. The merger is expected to cost 3,900, or nearly 10 percent, of the combined companies' 40,000 jobs, through attrition where possible. Yet Mellon also said it plans to add 1,000 to 2,000 jobs in three to five years. The combined company, Bank of New York Mellon Corp., will be based in New York, but its cash management and stock transfer units will remain in Pittsburgh. "Because of Mellon's historical importance, we unilaterally understood the advantages to a Pittsburgh location," including a large talent pool and low labor costs, Mellon Chief Executive Robert Kelly said on a conference call with reporters. Kelly would become chief executive of Bank of New York Mellon after the merger closes, expected by next July. A combined company will be the world's biggest custodian of assets for institutional investors, with $16.6 trillion under administration, and rank 10th in asset management. Mellon was founded in 1869, and financier Andrew Mellon took it over in 1882 when his father Thomas retired. The merger poses an early challenge for Pittsburgh Mayor Luke Ravenstahl, who at age 26 in September, became the youngest mayor of a major U.S. city after predecessor Bob O'Connor died. "Early indications are that perhaps this is a good thing for the region," Ravenstahl told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Pittsburgh remains home to a few big companies such as Alcoa Inc. ( AA.N ), H.J. Heinz Co. HNZ.N, United States Steel Corp. ( X.N ), and PNC Financial Services Group Inc. ( PNC.N ). The city shifted toward a more service-oriented economy after the steel industry, whose growth Mellon helped finance, was devastated in the 1970s and 1980s. Pittsburgh's population has fallen by roughly half since 1950. Kelly told the Post-Gazette he "absolutely" argued to keep Mellon based in Pittsburgh, but "New York City is the financial capital of the planet and it is difficult to argue with that." Dick Skrinjar, a spokesman for Kelly, said in an interview city officials plan to meet both companies within 10 days. Geographic diversity might help Bank of New York Mellon cope with a major market disruption. The September 11 attacks illustrated the importance of spreading operations and data centers should disaster strike in one area. (Additional reporting by  Joan Gralla )
