 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Hospital company Universal Health Services Inc. ( UHS.N ) on Monday said it has hired nurses and other temporary workers to replace employees involved in a contract dispute at two medical centers in Las Vegas. 

 The workers at Valley Hospital Medical Center and Desert Springs Medical Center are members of the Service Employees International Union, or SEIU, the biggest health-care union in the United States. About 800 nurses and 100 technicians at the two hospitals are affected in the contract dispute, the union said. Universal said the number is much lower than that, and at least 33 percent of the nurses at the hospitals are not unionized. Nurses at the hospitals had agreed not to strike after elected officials in Nevada called for a 30-day cooling off period, but those nurses and other workers were locked out when they showed up for work on Monday, the union said. "They reported to work this morning and were locked out. They are now picketing loudly in front of these two hospitals," Jane McAlevey, the union's Las Vegas executive director, said. King of Prussia, Pennsylvania-based Universal Health Services said that because the union did not withdraw its official notice of intent to strike, the company went ahead with its plans for temporary workers for a planned five-day period. The union denied that. "Ten days ago, the union told us they were going to strike. We took that threat very seriously," Steve Filton, chief Financial Officer at Universal Health said in a statement. The two sides are locked in a dispute about staffing levels and mandatory overtime, among other issues. A local Universal Health official also said a cooling off period was useless if the union didn't alter its demands. The SEIU says it represents about 900,000 health-care workers in the United States, including 110,000 nurses and 40,000 doctors. (Additional reporting by Anup Roy in Bangalore)
