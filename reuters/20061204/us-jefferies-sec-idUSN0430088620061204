 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Lavish gifts and travel designed to attract trading business to Jefferies Group Inc. JEF.N came back to haunt the investment bank after it agreed on Monday to pay $9.7 million to settle charges with regulators. 

 The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which began investigating the gifts scandal in 2004, found Jefferies traders gave nearly $2 million worth of gifts to their customers at Fidelity, the world's largest mutual fund company, over a three year period. Along the way investigators uncovered Jefferies funded weekend golf outings, pricey tickets to Wimbledon and a bachelor party that featured dwarf-tossing. "The value of improper gifts and entertainment in this case is unprecedented," James Shorris, head of enforcement at the NASD, said in a statement. The investment bank and trading firm agreed to pay $4.2 million to settle the SEC charges, and $5.5 million to settle related charges with securities regulator NASD. The SEC also settled with Scott Jones, Jefferies' director of equities, and Kevin Quinn, a former equity sales trader, on related charges. NASD permanently banned Quinn from working with broker dealers and fined Jones $50,000, suspended him for three months from working as a supervisor and banned him from supervising entertainment and gifts for two years. Jefferies, Quinn and Jones settled without admitting or denying the allegations. "This relates to the activities of a trader Jefferies terminated for cause. There was no evidence that Jefferies knew what the trader was doing," Jefferies attorney Bruce Baird said. Fidelity said the settlement marks a first phase in the resolution of the probe. "None of the Fidelity employees referenced in the settlement continue to work on the trading desk and many are no longer employees of the company," Fidelity spokeswoman Anne Crowley said. Michael Tuteur, Quinn's attorney, noted Quinn's "contract with Jefferies was unprecedented and approved at the highest levels within Jefferies; and every T&E voucher was submitted to and approved by Mr. Quinn's supervisors." An attorney for Jones declined to comment. OVER THE TOP Broker-dealers under NASD rules cannot give gifts worth more than $100 a year per individual customer. Yet NASD said Jefferies gave Quinn an annual travel and entertainment budget of $1.5 million to entertain Fidelity traders with the goal of increasing trading orders from the funds giant. In one instance, Jefferies in 2002 gave a Fidelity trader a private flight from Massachusetts to Bermuda costing $17,000. A year later it flew the trader to Los Angeles and Florida for $70,000 and $31,000, respectively, gave the trader $500 golf clubs and a flight to Puerto Rico costing $23,000. Another Fidelity trader received Wimbledon tickets costing $19,000, eight bottles of wine at a cost of $5,900, tickets to a Justin Timberlake-Christina Aguilera concert costing $1,200, and $7,000 in U.S. Open tennis tournament tickets. NASD also said it discovered some gifts that also crossed the lines of propriety. Quinn in 2003 paid more than $75,000 for a limousine and chartered flights as part of a bachelor party excursion in Miami for the former Fidelity trader. In 2004, Quinn spent $125,000 to take Fidelity traders to the Super Bowl in Houston plus a weekend of entertainment that included parties hosted by Maxim and Playboy magazines. NASD ordered Jefferies to hire a consultant to review its policies and procedures related to gifts and entertainment.
