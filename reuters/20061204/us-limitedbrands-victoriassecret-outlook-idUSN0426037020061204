 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Post-Thanksgiving sales at Limited Brands Inc.'s ( LTD.N ) Victoria's Secret unit trounced the group's internal forecasts, the group chief executive officer said on Monday. 

 "We had only planned for high-single digit increases" in sales on the Friday following Thanksgiving, said Victoria's Secret head Sharen Turney in an interview with Reuters. "And we were in the mid-double digit range. All the businesses exceeded expectations and we were very pleased with that Thanksgiving weekend." Analysts and investors scrutinize retailers' sales and customer traffic over the Friday, Saturday and Sunday following the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday to see how consumers are responding to the company's holiday selections. Brisk sales are often considered an early signal of whether a company is on track to meet its financial forecasts for the last quarter of the year. Sales at the Victoria's Secret unit, known for its intimate apparel, makeup and the Pink group of casual sportswear, make up more than 60 percent of Limited Brand's annual revenues, which are expected to be more than $10 billion this year. The group took 18 months to plan its holiday approach. This year it offered a free tote bag with purchase and launched five new product lines to attract customers. "There are a lot of things going on within the brand," said Turney. "We're continuing to innovate." Limited shares were up 82 cents, or 2.68 percent, at $31.40 in late-afternoon trading. The stock has climbed 40 percent so far this year, outpacing the 18-percent gain for the Dow Jones U.S. retail and apparel index .DJUSRA. It sells for 15.8 times next-year's expected earnings, compared with an average 16.4 times for companies in the retail index.
