 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Interpublic Group ( IPG.N ), the world's third-largest advertising group, said on Monday it was not in talks over a possible sale of the company, dismissing speculation over interest from French rival Publicis ( PUBP.PA ). 

 "We are not in negotiations with Publicis nor anyone else," Chief Executive Michael Roth told the UBS Global Media and Communications Conference in New York when asked about reports of a tie-up with Publicis. Advertising trade reports said Publicis was expected to discuss this week a possible bid for Interpublic, including a potential partnership with Japan's Dentsu to finance a purchase. Publicis CEO Maurice Levy also denied the speculation in comments to the Wall Street Journal. Interpublic, the parent company of agencies like DraftFCB and McCann-Erickson, is in the midst of a turnaround after struggling with client losses, earnings restatements and management changes. Its agencies have recently won accounts for Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) and DirecTV Group Inc. DTV.N, among others. Roth said on Monday that "whenever you have a company in turnaround," speculation about a sale is likely to surface. Still, he denied any talk of a deal, saying the company had to "keep our heads down, execute against our plans." Publicis owns agencies including Starcom MediaVest and Leo Burnett.
