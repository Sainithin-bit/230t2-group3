 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rallied on Monday, sending the Standard & Poor's 500 index to a six-year high and the Nasdaq Composite index up more than 1 percent, as corporate takeover deals and lower crude oil prices boosted investor optimism about the economy and corporate profits. 

 Those factors offset a sell-off in shares of Pfizer Inc. ( PFE.N ), the world's biggest drugmaker, after it abandoned a key experimental drug. Bank of New York Co. Inc. ( BK.N ) was a key driver of the gains after announcing plans to buy Mellon Financial Corp. MEL.N for about $16.5 billion to create the world's largest securities servicing and asset management firm. In other markets, the dollar steadied after recent losses, also underpinning U.S. stock gains, while U.S. Treasury debt prices eased. "There's cash out there, and M&A activity continues to be robust," said Owen Fitzpatrick, head of U.S. equity group at Deutsche Bank Private Wealth Management in New York, speaking about the stock market. On the down side, "We have the news out of Pfizer, and the magnitude of the sell-off looks to be quite sharp." The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was up 87.64 points, or 0.7 percent, at 12,281.77. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was up 12.15 points, or 0.9 percent, at 1,408.86. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was up 35.03 points, or 1.5 percent, at 2,448.24. Adding to the optimism, a report from a real estate trade association suggested the housing market was stabilizing. DRUG TERMINATED Shares of Mellon rose 6.8 percent to $42.78, while shares of the Bank of New York gained 12 percent to $39.75. In other merger news, LSI Logic Corp. LSI.N, a maker of storage and DVD chips, said it would buy semiconductor and software storage company Agere Systems Inc. AGR.N for about $3.5 billion in stock. Agere shares rose 8.5 percent, while LSI shares dropped 13.6 percent. Shares of Pfizer, a Dow component, dropped 10.6 percent to $24.90 after it said had stopped development of experimental cholesterol drug torcetrapib.     U.S. Treasury debt prices drifted higher on Monday keeping benchmark yields near their lowest since January, though dealers were reluctant to push the market too far ahead of key data later in the week. Benchmark 10-year note prices rose 1/32, sending yields US10YT=RR up to 4.43 percent. The dollar stabilized near a 20-month low against the euro and a basket of currencies on Monday as investors locked in profits after shaving more than 3 percent off its value in less than two weeks. The euro  EUR=  was trading down 0.1 percent at $1.3326 while dollar/yen  JPY=  was down 0.1 percent at 115.30 yen. The steadier dollar also helped bolster the stock market, analysts said. "There's relief in the stock market that the decline in the dollar has stopped," said Stephen Massocca, co-chief executive at San Francisco-based investment bank Pacific Growth Equities. "M&A activity also clearly helps, but I think if the dollar were to continue to drop, that would put a stop to the gains." EURO BONDS FALL Euro zone government bonds were lower on Monday but had pared some of the earlier losses seen after dealers booked profits from the contract high reached the prior session. The 10-year Bund yield EU10YT=RR was steady at 3.663 percent, still near the two-month low plumbed on Friday. European shares closed higher on Monday, ending a two-day losing streak, lifted by mining stocks. The FTSEurofirst 300 index  .FTEU3  of pan-European blue chips closed up 0.6 percent at 1,429.95. Earlier, Japan's Nikkei average  .N225  fell 0.11 percent, or 18.19 points, to close at 16,303.59 as shares of exporters such as Honda Motor co. Ltd. ( 7267.T ) fell on a strong yen. U.S. crude for January delivery CLF7 settled 99 cents lower at $62.44 per barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange on profit-taking amid forecasts for warmer weather in the U.S. next week and trader doubts about another OPEC production cut. Brent crude futures LCOc1 ended $1.17 lower at $63.45 on Monday as traders took profits after last week's rally. Gold made a small gain but analysts said any weak U.S. economic data could send the metal higher. Comex gold GCZ6 for February delivery rose 30 cents an ounce to $651.20 after rising as high as $653.90 in the earlier session.
