 MUMBAI  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) on Thursday 
said it would invest more than $200 million initially in a 
powertrain plant in India, as the troubled carmaker aims to 
double its share of a fast-growing but increasingly competitive 
market. 

  The facility, that will be located in Talegaon in western 
Maharashtra state, at the site of GM's second vehicle plant, 
will have an annual capacity of 160,000 units, which can be 
expanded to 300,000 units, GM said in a statement.  The engine plant was expected to be completed in the first 
quarter of 2010, it said.  GM, which makes the Chevrolet-badged Tavera, Optra, Aveo 
and Spark, will have a capacity to make 140,000 vehicles in the 
new Talegaon plant that is scheduled to start operations next 
week, taking its all-India capacity to more than 225,000 units.  GM will also make a new small car in Talegaon. Annual 
passenger vehicle sales in India are forecast to expand to more 
than 2 million units by 2010, with small cars accounting for 
more than two-thirds of sales.  ($1=43.7 rupees)  (Reporting by  Rina Chandran ; Editing by Ranjit Gangadharan)
