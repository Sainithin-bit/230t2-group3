 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The largest labor union at Boeing Co ( BA.N ) said on Thursday it received the company's latest contract offer. 

 Boeing is hoping to prevent a strike that could cost the company $3 billion a month. "The union received the company's offer and is currently reviewing it line by line to see all changes and how they impact our members. We will be making a statement later today," the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) said in an e-mailed statement. A Boeing spokesman said the company would make an announcement soon.
