 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Most of the top retail brokerage firms' model portfolios performed better than the S&P 500 in the first half of the year's volatile market, a survey showed on Thursday. 

 While 13 of 14 of the participating retail brokerages had negative total returns for the first six months of 2008, nine outperformed the benchmark S&P 500 index, according to the survey by Zacks Investment Research. Raymond James' RFJ.N model portfolio was the only one of the 14 to post a positive total return. Its total return was 0.27 percent, versus the S&P 500's negative 11.91 percent in the first half. Morgan Keegan, a unit of Regions Financial Corp ( RF.N ), and Credit Suisse ( CSGN.VX ) followed in second and third place respectively. Seven of the 14 outperformed the benchmark index by 1 percent or more. The better-performing model portfolios contained computer technology and energy company shares, Zacks said. The model portfolios were created from all the U.S. traded stocks, including ADRs, a brokerage firm produces recommendations on, Zacks said. (Reporting by  Kristina Cooke ; Editing by Dan Grebler)
