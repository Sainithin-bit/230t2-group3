 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Diversified U.S. chipmaker Marvell Technology Group Ltd ( MRVL.O ) posted better-than-expected profit on Thursday as revenues grew strongly in the second quarter. 

 The company reported second-quarter net income of $71.4 million, or 11 cents per share, compared with a net loss of $56.5 million, or 10 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Non-GAAP profit quadrupled to 24 cents a share. Revenue rose 28 percent to $842.6 million from $656.7 million a year earlier. Wall Street analysts had been expecting Marvell to post non-GAAP profit of 21 cents a share on revenue of $836 million, according to Reuters Estimates. "The results for our second quarter were better than we had anticipated," said Dr. Sehat Sutardja, Marvell Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in a statement. "We also continued to realize recurring benefits from our improved efficiency." (Reporting by  Yinka Adegoke ; Editing by  Gary Hill  and  Andre Grenon )
