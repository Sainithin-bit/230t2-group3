 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Dell Inc DELL.O posted a worse-than-expected 17 percent drop in net profit and said conservative technology spending in the United States was spreading to Western Europe and Asia, driving its shares down 10 percent. 

 Dell's fiscal second quarter profit, excluding some items, was 33 cents per share, missing the average analyst forecast of 36 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. COMMENTARY: TIM GHRISKEY, CHIEF INVESTMENT, SOLARIS ASSET MANAGEMENT,  WHICH MANAGES OVER $2 BILLION "They're saying lower IT spending is spreading. That is evidence of a global slowdown in IT spending. This certainly isn't good news for tech overall. Dell's outlook is for slower spending - especially in Asia and Western Europe." "We would expect the tech group to suffer when the market opens tomorrow morning and overnight as well." "It looks like Dell's margins were bad. Not surprised to see their margins affected given their change in distribution outlets that they are using, their contributed expansion out of direct sales and to third parties. SHANNON CROSS, ANALYST, CROSS RESEARCH "We've got a real weak economy pretty much across the board except for emerging markets, and in order to sell and to move product, people have to price aggressively." "It's a really tough tech market and Dell is obviously cutting costs, but it wasn't enough to offset the pressure on gross margin. What people on the Street wanted to see was revenue growth and a solid gross margin number. Because if you sell things for no profit, to some extent, what's the point?" "This indicates that they might have to streamline even more now." JOHN MENZIES, PORTFOLIO MANAGER AT SAN FRANCISCO-BASED INVESTMENT BANK PACIFIC GROWTH EQUITIES "The thing that is concerning and the thing that is making the stock go down is they're starting to talk about demand destruction in Western Europe and in Asia. Up until this point the large tech companies, like the IBMs of the world, have done pretty well in holding up their earnings because they've had strong and consistent international demand. But this shows international economies are slowing down and Dell cited that specifically. That probably was reflected in the margins, which were short of expectations, which effectively means these guys didn't have the pricing power that they wanted and that was why there was a miss on their EPS. The other thing is that they aggressively were buying back shares, which would only make their earnings per share number look better and that didn't help either. So a lot of negatives- a fall off in international demand, they were light on their margins and they missed on their EPS even though they bought back $1.5 billion of the stock." BRENT BRACELIN, ANALYST, PACIFIC CREST SECURITIES "Revenue came in much much stronger than anybody expected. The company continues to take share. The cost cutting drove the operating expenses to decline sequentially, so they are doing a good job focusing on the turnaround." "Unfortunately the big surprise was the gross margin. They got more aggressive on pricing and promotional activities than we had thought." "Obviously it is a mixed big with two positives and one negative." "The new news would be talking about a bit of a slowdown in western Europe and Asia." "This company just reported their highest growth rate in two years. So you have to factor in what they said on the risk side with what they just reported."
