 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. jeweler Tiffany & Co ( TIF.N ) posted a higher quarterly profit on Thursday, benefiting from strong international sales and solid tourist spending at its New York flagship store. 

 The net profit was $80.8 million, or 63 cents per share, in its fiscal second quarter, ended July 31, compared with $40.5 million, or 29 cents per share, a year earlier. (Reporting by  Aarthi Sivaraman ; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)
