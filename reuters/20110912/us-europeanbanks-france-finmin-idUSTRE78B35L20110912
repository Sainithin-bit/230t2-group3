 PARIS  (Reuters) - French Finance Minister Francois Baroin denied on Monday that French banks were in crisis, as fears of their exposure to Greek debt knocked the shares of top French banks. 

 "There is no crisis for the banks because those that are currently being hit on the markets have all the necessary means to offer solutions," Baroin told reporters. (Reporting by  Leigh Thomas ; Editing by  Catherine Bremer )
