 DALLAS  (Reuters) - The challenges facing the economy are so great that policy makers are likely to continue to disagree on what to do about it, a top Fed official who dissented on the Fed's most recent move said on Monday. 

 "I expect more dissents," Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher said after a speech to the National Association of Business Economics. The Fed's decision last month drew three dissents, including Fisher's. (Reporting by  Ann Saphir , Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
