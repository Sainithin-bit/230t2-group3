 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - The euro zone will do everything needed to defend the euro including if needed, increasing the size of the bloc's bailout fund, the EFSF, Eurogroup head Jean-Claude Juncker was quoted as saying on Monday. 

 "We will do everything that will be needed in order to defend the euro," Juncker told newsagency Market News International, who added that that included increasing the size of the EFSF. Juncker was also quoted as saying the euro zone would present "a proper solution in the next couple of days" to address Finland's demand for collateral in exchange for further Greek aid.
