 BANGALORE  (Reuters) - Williams-Sonoma Inc ( WSM.N ) posted a surprise quarterly profit on cost-cutting and raised its fiscal-year outlook on Wednesday, saying leaner inventories should boost margins in the back half of the year, and the home-goods retailer's shares rose 10 percent. 

 The operator of the Williams-Sonoma cookware and Pottery Barn furnishings chains has closed underperforming stores, lowered its advertising spending and kept inventories tight in a bid to cut costs as sales continue to slump in the weak U.S. economy and housing market. But like many other retailers, the company has had to slash prices on some items, which some analysts have said could tarnish its image as a high-end chain. Williams-Sonoma, which also plans to reduce its distribution capacity and leased office space, said it expected to close seven more stores by the end of the year, raising the total number of closings this year to 16. The company, whose rivals include Bed Bath & Beyond ( BBBY.O ) and Pier 1 Imports ( PIR.N ), said its merchandise inventories at the end of the second quarter were down 21.3 percent, helped by markdowns. That decline outpaced an 18 percent drop in revenue to $672.1 million. "While Williams-Sonoma's retail performance clearly leaves much to be desired, trends have improved over the past two quarters, suggesting that performance has stabilized," said Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Colin McGranahan. McGranahan, who has a "market-perform" rating on the stock, said aggressive inventory clearances had "set the stage for more healthy gross margin performance in the second half." Williams-Sonoma raised its full-year outlook to earnings of 19 cents to 31 cents a share before one-time items. It previously had expected results to range from a loss of 7 cents to a profit of 11 cents. In terms of revenue, the company raised the bottom end of its forecast range to $2.84 billion from $2.81 billion, but kept the top end unchanged at $2.94 billion. Williams-Sonoma shares were up 10 percent at $17.02 on the New York Stock Exchange. "While Williams-Sonoma's management team has been doing a commendable job operating in the difficult environment, we think the stock's valuation already reflects this," Barclays Capital analyst Michael Lasser said, adding that he recommended shareholders take profits on Wednesday. Net profit fell to $399,000, or a fraction of a cent per share, in the second quarter that ended August 2, from $18.4 million, or 17 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, the company earned 5 cents a share. On that basis, analysts on average had expected a loss of 9 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales at stores open at least a year fell 15.3 percent, driven by declines at all brands, including Pottery Barn, Williams-Sonoma and Pottery Barn Kids. On a conference call with analysts, a Williams-Sonoma executive said the company was cautious about the fourth quarter, as the promotional environment could accelerate during the holiday shopping season. Home-goods retailers have seen sales crumble as consumers stick to buying essentials in the recession. Several companies such as Linens 'n Things have gone out of business, and the others continue to struggle.
