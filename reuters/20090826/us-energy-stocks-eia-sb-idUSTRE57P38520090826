 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. crude inventories chalked up a small surprise build last week as imports rebounded and demand by refiners eased, U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) weekly data showed on Wednesday. 

 Commercial petroleum stockpiles in the world's top consumer rose to a total 343.8 million barrels in the week to August 21, up 200,000 barrels, EIA said, compared with analysts' projections they would be down by 1.1 million barrels. The data confirmed Tuesday's American Petroleum Institute (API) data which showed a much larger, unexpected stocks rise. Imports of crude oil were up by a large 1.11 million barrels per day at 9.23 million bpd, EIA said. Petroleum used up by domestic refiners, known as crude runs, fell by 21,000 bpd. Refinery utilization was up by an anemic 0.1 percentage point to 84.1 percent of capacity, trailing estimates for a rise of 0.3 percentage point. U.S. gasoline stocks fell by a larger-than-expected 1.7 million barrels to 208.1 million, EIA reported, versus an expected 1 million barrel fall. Distillate inventories rose 800,000 barrels to total 162.4 million barrels, topping analysts' calls of a modest 300,000 barrel increase. Late Tuesday's API oil data report showed U.S. crude stocks unexpectedly rose 4.3 million barrels last week as imports sped ahead while gasoline supplies were down 1.8 million barrels and distillates were off 146,000 barrels. <API/S> (Reporting by  Haitham Haddadin , New York Energy Desk)
