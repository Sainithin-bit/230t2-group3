 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - New orders for long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods rose more than expected in July, posting their biggest gain in two years, according to a government report on Wednesday that offered more evidence a modest economic recovery was probably starting to take shape. 

 KEY POINTS: * Durable goods orders jumped 4.9 percent, the largest advance since July 2007, after falling by a revised 1.3 percent in June, previously reported as a 2.2 percent drop, the Commerce Department said. * Excluding transportation, durables rose 0.8 percent, just off expectations for a 0.9 percent increase. * Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast orders rising 3 percent in July. However, compared to the same period last year, new orders were still down 25.8 percent. * A key series measuring demand from businesses, non-defense capital goods, excluding aircraft, fell 0.3 percent in July, after a 3.6 percent increase in June. COMMENTS: KURT KARL, HEAD OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH AND CONSULTING, SWISS RE, NEW YORK: "It is very good news, even ex-transportation it is up 0.8. Transportation has been the huge thing with the cash for clunkers. New orders were really strong and a lot of that is transportation, a huge bit of non-defense aircraft, which is pretty volatile. Non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft is not so great news -- so we are still struggling along." PETER JANKOVSKIS, CO-CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, OAKBROOK  INVESTMENTS LLC, LISLE, ILLINOIS: "We're probably seeing some impact of the cash for clunkers program since the headline number is up quite substantially and higher than expected and the ex-transports came in a little light. But they did revise up the prior month ex-transports as well. So even without cash for clunkers it's a reasonably strong report. "The reality is that they are waiting on the consumption number coming out tomorrow. That's the final piece of the puzzle. The vast majority of GDP is personal consumption and that has been the one that has been down now for five months in a row and people are worried about. So while this is positive news, the important news is yet to come." DAN GREENHAUS, ANALYST, MILLER TABAK & CO, NEW YORK: "The headline figure was up more much than expected, driven by a large increase in the transportation sector, not surprisingly. Excluding that, it was about as expected. "We keep an eye on core capital goods, as that is a proxy for business spending. Orders in that regards fell 0.3 percent, however, shipments of those goods rose 0.5 percent. The shipment data is positive, whereas the order data is slightly negative for the shipments going forwards. "This won't have much of an impact on the market today, since the expectation was for the transports to have an out-sized impact. People were looking for the number that excluded that, which was about in line." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stock index futures rose briefly before falling back. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices fell initially before reversing course to unchanged. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar rose against the euro. It rose against the yen, but quickly fell back.
