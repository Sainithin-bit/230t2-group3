 LONDON  (Reuters) - Britain said on Wednesday it has already made clear that the bonus culture of financial institutions needs to change after French proposals of curbs on bankers' pay. 

 "The Chancellor has been clear that the short-term bonus culture must change," a Treasury spokesman said. "In addition to taking forward Sir David Walker's proposals to reform rules governing executive pay, he intends to raise this issue at the G20 Finance Ministers' meeting in London next week."
