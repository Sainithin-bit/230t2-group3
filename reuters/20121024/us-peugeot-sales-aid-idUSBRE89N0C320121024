 PARIS  (Reuters) - The French government-backed rescue plan for PSA Peugeot Citroen's struggling lending arm will comply with European Union rules, Chief Financial Officer Jean-Baptiste de Chatillon said on Wednesday. 
 Peugeot announced a government-brokered deal to secure 11.5 billion euros ($14.9 billion) in bank financing and a state guarantee on up to 7 billion euros of future borrowings. Peugeot said it would pay the government for the guarantee. "It's not state aid, it's state support," Chatillon said during a call with analysts and reporters. "It's priced at market values."
