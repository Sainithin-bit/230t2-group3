 (Reuters) - Legendary investor Warren Buffett on Wednesday said he hoped Ben Bernanke would stay for a third term as the head of the Federal Reserve, even with reports that Bernanke would prefer to leave when his current term ends. 
 In a CNBC interview, Buffett said there was no one better for the job and that he suspected Bernanke would be willing to stay if asked. (Reporting By  Ben Berkowitz ; Editing by Maureen Bavdek)
