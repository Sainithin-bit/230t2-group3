 (Reuters) - Nasdaq OMX Group ( NDAQ.O ) reported a lower third-quarter profit on Wednesday, due in part to a drop in trading volumes in U.S. and Nordic equities. 
 The New York-based exchange operator said it had earned $89 million, or 52 cents per share, down from $109 million, or 61 cents per share, a year earlier. (Reporting by  John McCrank  in New York; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
