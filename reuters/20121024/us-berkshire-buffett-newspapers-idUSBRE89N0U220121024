 (Reuters) - Revenue is down at Berkshire Hathaway Inc's newspapers this year, though the smaller newspapers are doing better than the larger ones, Chief Executive Warren Buffett said on Wednesday. 
 In a CNBC interview, Buffett said revenue at the smaller papers was down about 1 percent this year, while the larger papers like those in Buffalo, New York, and Omaha, Nebraska, are down more like 4 to 5 percent for the year. (Reporting By  Ben Berkowitz ; Editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
