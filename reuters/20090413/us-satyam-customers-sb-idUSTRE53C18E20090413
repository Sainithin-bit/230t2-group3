 MUMBAI  (Reuters) - The vast majority of customers of fraud-hit Satyam Computer Services SATY.BO have stayed on through the process of a stake sale in the company, Chairman Kiran Karnik said on Monday. 

 India's Tech Mahindra ( TEML.BO ) was the highest bidder for Satyam, agreeing to buy a 31 percent stake at 58 rupees per share, a 23 percent premium to Satyam's last closing price. (Reporting by Prashant Mehra; Editing by  John Mair )
