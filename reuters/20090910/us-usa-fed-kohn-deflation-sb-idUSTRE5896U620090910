 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Donald Kohn said on Thursday that the U.S. central bank was not paying too much attention to avoiding inflation at the risk that the country might fall into a deflationary trap. 

 "We are doing this on a two-sided basis," Kohn told a policy conference hosted at the Brookings Institution. He said that its policies were aimed at preventing inflation and inflation expectations from falling too low as well as rising too far. (Reporting by  Alister Bull , Editing by Kenneth Barry)
