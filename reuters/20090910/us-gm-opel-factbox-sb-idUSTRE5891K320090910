 (Reuters) - General Motors said its board of directors has made a decision about the fate of its European business Opel and would communicate the verdict to Germany and other European governments. 

 Below is a summary of the main GM factories in Europe: * GERMANY: RUESSELSHEIM: About 15,600 employees assembled roughly 120,000 vehicles last year at Opel's headquarters. The factory built the Vectra and Signum models as well as the new Insignia. The site also houses a technical center that carries out research and development for the entire GM group. BOCHUM: A staff of some 5,200 produced close to 200,000 Astra compacts and Astra-based Zafira vans last year in Germany's traditional coal-mining district, which has been grappling with high unemployment for years. Under the original Magna plan, some 2,200 jobs were at risk, according to German politicians. EISENACH: About 1,800 workers assembled 156,972 three-door Corsa subcompacts at the plant, which was inaugurated in 1992 as a hallmark project to revive eastern Germany's decrepit industrial structure. KAISERSLAUTERN: About 3,500 employees manufacture four-cylinder petrol and diesel engines and components in a plant situated in Rhineland-Palatinate. Close to 150,000 engines were built there last year. * BRITAIN: ELLESMERE PORT: The site assembled over 110,000 Astras in 2008 under the Vauxhall badge, the British version of the Opel brand. LUTON: Last year built about 60,000 Vivaro delivery vans, a larger sister to the Combo used for commercial purposes. The site is also home to production of some 27,000 Renault Trafic vans. Like Antwerp, a potential candidate for closure. * OTHER FACTORIES IN EUROPE: BELGIUM - Antwerp: Some 133,000 Astras were built in the Flemish plant, often considered to be one of the top candidates for closure. POLAND - Gliwice: Built about 170,000 vehicles last year, mainly Zafiras as well as Astras, making it a chief rival to Bochum for production volume. SPAIN - Zaragoza: Built 423,000 vehicles last year, consisting of five-door Corsas, the Meriva minivan based on the Corsa architecture and the Combo delivery van.
