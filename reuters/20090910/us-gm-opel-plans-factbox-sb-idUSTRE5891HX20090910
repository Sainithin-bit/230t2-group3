 (Reuters) - General Motors' board of directors has decided what to do with its Opel operations in Europe and will communicate its decision shortly, the U.S. carmaker said on Thursday. 

 Following is a summary of plans for Opel by rival bidders, Canadian auto parts maker Magna and Belgian-listed financial investor RHJ: MAGNA - Strategy Wants to use spare plant capacity at Opel by tapping into its expertise in contract manufacturing and building rival models for outside carmakers. It forecasts high growth rates, particularly in Russia, home of its consortium partners Sberbank and GAZ. - Shareholding Magna and Sberbank would each hold 27.5 percent. Around 10 percent would be taken up by Opel workers and 35 percent will remain with GM. - State guarantees The group needs 4.5 billion euros ($6.6 billion) of guarantees from the German government. - Equity investment Would invest 500 million euros in Opel. Of this, 350 million would be an immediate equity injection. The rest would be debt that can be later converted into equity. - Jobs Around 10,000 of the total 50,000 jobs across Europe would be cut, with 25 percent of the job losses in Germany. - Plants Could close Antwerp plant in Belgium and Luton in Britain if it has no luck in luring new contracts to make use of their capacities. RHJ - Strategy Wants to shrink Opel's production to return the company to profit. It is expected to sell its holding in the company at some point in the future, possibly even back to GM. - Shareholding RHJ to hold 50.1 percent stake, while GM retains 39.9 percent. The remaining 10 percent would be held by workers. - State guarantees Needs German state guarantees totaling 3.2 billion euros, down from an original request for 3.8 billion. These would be paid back by 2013, a year earlier than first envisaged. - Equity investment To pay 300 million euros, up from the original plan of paying 175 million at the closing of the deal plus 100 million euros on December 31, 2012 - Jobs To cut about 10,000 jobs throughout Europe, of which 8,100 are in manufacturing - Plants To close Antwerp by March 2010 and mothball Germany's Eisenach for the next two years.
