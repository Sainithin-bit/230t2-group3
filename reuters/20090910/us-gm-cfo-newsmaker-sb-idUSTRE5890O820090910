 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Co's chief financial officer, an executive groomed for the leadership of the automaker over a two-decade career, is about to become the highest profile departure since GM emerged from bankruptcy. 

 At a two-day meeting of GM's board in Detroit that concluded on Wednesday, directors endorsed plans for GM Chief Financial Officer Ray Young to leave the company, sources briefed on the deliberations said. Young, 47, who has spent his entire career with GM, was not immediately available for comment. GM had no immediate comment. Elevated to his current post just eighteen months ago, Young had held posts from North America, to Europe to Asia and South America. Those included key positions once held by Chief Executive Fritz Henderson and his predecessor Rick Wagoner. Born to Chinese immigrant parents in Canada, Young was promoted to the top financial position at GM just as decades of gradual market share losses in the automaker's home U.S. market accelerated into a full-blown crisis. By his first anniversary, GM was operating under a U.S. government bailout and struggling to develop a turnaround plan to satisfy an Obama administration task force overseeing the restructurings of GM and U.S. rival Chrysler. Word of Young's pending departure came as a congressional oversight panel said taxpayers were unlikely to be repaid in full for the emergency financing of GM that began to take shape in late 2008 and included $50 billion in bankruptcy funding. Young joined GM's operations in Canada after earning a master's degree in business administration from the University of Chicago in 1986 with a specialty in international business. Over the next 20 years Young held a number of positions at GM including managing director of the automaker's operations in Brazil, a job once held by Henderson and Wagoner. Both also served as CFO before their promotions to CEO and Young had been seen as a potential successor at the automaker's top job before its financial crisis put it under the control of a task force operating under the U.S. Treasury. GM emerged from bankruptcy in July after receiving $50 billion in emergency U.S. financing. As part of its turnaround effort, the company has faced pressure to reform a highly bureaucratic corporate culture that critics say hastened its collapse. Young had been one of a handful of executives named to a team that includes marketing chief Bob Lutz and product development head Tom Stephens charged with making faster decisions on key strategy questions under Henderson. Young's successor as GM's top financial executive faces a key challenge in the months ahead. Just a month ago, Young told reporters that the company's financial staff would be focused in the remainder of the year on preparing accounting statements needed to allow GM to re-emerge as a public company. U.S. officials have said an initial public offering of GM stock could come as soon as 2010. (Reporting by Bernie Woodall and David Bailey; editing by Carol Bishopric)
