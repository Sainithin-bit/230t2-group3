 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Barrick Gold Corp ( ABX.TO ) said on Thursday that proceeds from its pending equity offering will total around $4 billion, making the stock sale the biggest in Canadian history, according to Thomson Reuters data. 

 The world's top gold miner said underwriters exercised in full their option to purchase an additional 14.21 million shares at a price of $36.95. The offering, including sale of the overallotment shares, is expected to close on or about September 23, and is subject to customary conditions, including the approval of the Toronto Stock Exchange. Barrick, in a move that shows its faith that gold will continue to rise, announced an equity sale of at least $3 billion late on Tuesday, to be used to eliminate all of its fixed-price gold hedges and a portion of its floating hedges. Gold has moved past the $1,000-an-ounce level this week. On Thursday, U.S. December gold futures settled down 30 cents at $996.80 an ounce on the COMEX division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. Barrick's said its common shares outstanding are expected to increase to approximately 982.7 million. (Reporting by Deena Beasley; Editing by  Christian Wiessner )
