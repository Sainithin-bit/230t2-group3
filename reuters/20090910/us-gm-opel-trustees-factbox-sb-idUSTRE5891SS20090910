 (Reuters) - A trust set up in May to keep carmaker Opel from being swept into the insolvency proceedings of General Motors controls a 65 percent stake in Opel and has final word over who might buy the company. 

 GM holds the remaining 35 percent. The five members of the trust are: Representing GM: GM Europe finance chief Enrico Digirolamo GM's top negotiator on Opel, John Smith Representing the German federal and state governments: Manfred Wennemer, former CEO at automotive supplier Continental AG and a car industry veteran Dirk Pfeil, a politician from the pro-business Free Democrats Independent chairman: Fred Irwin, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Germany. He would not break any standoff in the panel because he does not have a vote, but he can try to forge consensus and push for new negotiations if necessary.
