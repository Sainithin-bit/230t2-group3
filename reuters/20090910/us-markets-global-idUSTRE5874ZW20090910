 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Positive earnings forecasts and a robust auction of U.S. Treasury bonds fueled investor appetite for risk on Thursday, boosting global stocks for a sixth straight session and sending the dollar near 12-month lows. 

 The sale of 30-year bonds eased U.S. fiscal concerns and propelled Treasuries prices, inverting the usual dynamic that sends prices of U.S. debt down when investors become more tolerant to risk. Further supporting market sentiment was a rise in oil prices and a better-than-expected reading on U.S. weekly jobless claims. A sharp widening of the U.S. trade gap was also seen as a sign that the world's largest economy is recovering, as imports rose partly on demand for foreign cars and consumer goods. "Commodities and stocks have turned around and things are getting a little better, so we're seeing the dollar being sold off," said Steven Butler, director of currency trading at Scotia Capital in Toronto. The MSCI's all-country world stock index .MIWD00000PUS rose 0.86 percent, adding to gains of about 4.5 percent during the past five sessions. Wall Street gained for the fifth consecutive session, as brighter earnings outlooks from Texas Instruments Inc TXN.N and Procter & Gamble Co ( PG.N ) eclipsed disappointing news from Monsanto Co ( MON.N ). The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  ended up 80.26 points, or 0.84 percent, at 9,627.48, while the Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  climbed 10.77 points, or 1.04 percent, to 1,044.14. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  finished up 23.63 points, or 1.15 percent, at 2,084.02. European shares ended slightly higher after a choppy session, with the FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of top shares closing up 0.05 percent at 988.33 points. The rally in U.S. Treasuries caused yields on some of the bonds to drop to their lowest since July, as investors covered short positions and unwound bets on rising long-term yields after the auction, which followed two other sales earlier in the week. "This was the best of the three, and the other two were pretty good," said Lou Brien, market strategist at DRW Trading in Chicago. Benchmark 10-year notes rose more than a point in price for a 3.34 percent yield, down from 3.48 percent on Wednesday's close. The 30-year yield was on track for its biggest one-day decline since late May, while 10-year yield was track for its steepest single-day drop since July 31. US DOLLAR FALLS AFTER AUCTION The strong demand in the Treasuries auction lifted the euro to as much as $1.4613, a fresh 2009 high. The single European currency was trading at $1.4580 in the afternoon. The dollar was also 0.38 percent weaker against a basket of six major currencies, according to the U.S. dollar index .DXY, which declined to its lowest level in nearly a year. Also supporting the appetite for higher-yielding assets was the U.S. weekly jobs data, which showed a decline in both the  number of U.S. workers filing new claims for jobless benefits and the number of workers still collecting such benefits. U.S. crude oil prices settled up 63 cents, or 0.88 percent, at $71.94 a barrel, after jumping above $72 a barrel earlier in the session. Crude prices rose after government data showed crude inventories fell last week, and the Paris-based International Energy Agency raised its demand outlook.
