 MOSCOW  (Reuters) - General Motors' decision to sell Opel to a consortium of Canadian car parts maker Magna MGa.TO and Russia's Sberbank SBER03.MM is an important intermediate step but not a final one, Sberbank said on Thursday. 

 "This decision didn't come out easy, neither for General Motors nor for us. Talks were very difficult and the deal's structure is unprecedentedly complicated," Sberbank's chief executive German Gref said in a statement. "The agreement of intention alone is a document of over 1,000 pages. And it is too early to say that a final decision has been taken. This is only a very important, intermediate stage of the deal," Gref added.
