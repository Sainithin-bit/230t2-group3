 LONDON  (Reuters) - The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries early on Thursday said it had agreed to keep output quotas unchanged following its latest meeting. 

 Following are selected quotes: DAVID KIRSCH, DIRECTOR OF MARKET INTELLIGENCE SERVICES AT PFC ENERGY, WASHINGTON "OPEC is still concerned about oil supplies on the market and they are choosing to address it through compliance. The lack of more aggressive action reflected a belief that demand will be sufficient in pulling down the overhang in the market. "It's a shift from previous OPEC policy in being more proactive against their downside risks and obviously the state of the economy played a part in this decision." TIM EVANS, ENERGY ANALYST, CITI FUTURES PERSPECTIVE, NEW YORK. "This decision by OPEC to maintain current quotas ... is very much in line with consensus expectations ahead of the meeting and also repeats the outcome of the March and May meetings, so I would not anticipate a strong price reaction." "That said, OPEC seems to be counting on stronger Q4 seasonal demand and economic recovery into 2010 to keep a floor under prices, when recent OPEC production has been above OPEC's own forecast for the 2010 call on OPEC crude oil, suggesting that inventories may remain high or continue to grow unless OPEC becomes more disciplined about adhering to quotas." ANTOINE HALFF, FIRST VICE PRESIDENT, DEPUTY HEAD OF RESEARCH, NEWEDGE GROUP, NEW YORK "This market had really no use for high OPEC drama and OPEC wisely abstained from providing any fireworks." "Oil prices have been firming on their own, regardless of a lack of any compelling sign of a rebound in demand, and despite continued high stocks. So, there was really no clear reason for OPEC to go to great lengths to change its policy. There's no need for more oil, because there's no shortfall of supply. But as long as there are buyers for OPEC oil, there's really no reason (for output changes)." (Reporting by OPEC reporting team and  Bruce Nichols  in Houston)
