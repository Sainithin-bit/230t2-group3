 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said on Thursday that it was vital to prevent excessive risk-taking by banks in order to create a more stable financial system. 

 "A critical part of creating a more effective financial system is to make sure there are strong constraints on risk-taking, much better protection for consumers, enforced more fairly and evenly," Geithner told a "town hall" meeting arranged by CNBC Television. He also said banks shouldn't be permitted to choose their own regulators because that gives them a chance to "shop for the weakest" -- a charge that was made in the past before the two-year-old financial crisis occurred.
