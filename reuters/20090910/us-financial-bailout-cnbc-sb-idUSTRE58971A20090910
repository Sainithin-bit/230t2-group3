 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said on Thursday that huge executive pay packages need to be brought under controls that include the ability to reclaim the money if performance is poor. 

 "You want compensation to come substantially in the form of equity in the firm that vests over time, that is at risk, that can be clawed back if returns don't materialize," he said in response to questions at a "town hall" event arranged by CNBC television. He also said that he was optimistic that China will keep buying U.S. debt securities. "I'm very confident they will," Geithner told a questioner.
