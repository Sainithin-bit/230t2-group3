 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - John Mack is stepping down as chief executive of Morgan Stanley following a string of losses, to be replaced by co-President James Gorman, the U.S. bank said on Thursday. 

 When Mack took the reins at Morgan Stanley, he was hailed as its savior. But since then, he has had his share of missteps. He's been criticized for misreading the markets -- his firm expanded into risky businesses at the end of the credit boom and stuck to the sidelines when markets roared back this year. Here are details of some of those missteps: PROPRIETARY TRADING AND COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE: Before the mortgage market-inspired financial crisis hit, Mack, who took the helm in 2005, boosted risk-taking on Morgan Stanley's trading desks and ratcheted up the bank's commercial real estate businesses. Once the mortgage market cracked in 2007, the company racked up billions of dollars in losses, adding to Morgan Stanley's perception as a bank one step behind others. In a November 2008 company slide it pledged to reshape prime brokerage, proprietary trading, principal investments, and commercial real estate. POOR CHOICE OF WORDS: In December, 2007, while discussing a fourth-quarter loss fueled by a worsening mortgage crisis, Mack made what later proved to be overly optimistic comments: "The fact is that we have a strong broad-based business. We're positive about our business mix ... we're optimistic about the long-term prospects." Four months later, with Bear Stearns driven into the arms of JPMorgan and the markets deteriorating, Mack again misjudged the severity of the crisis as he spoke at the firm's annual shareholder meeting: "If you look at the subprime problem in the U.S., you would say we're in the eighth inning or maybe the top of the ninth" of a nine-inning baseball game. "Leveraged lending, as we know it, is in the ninth inning." In late 2008, Morgan Stanley nearly collapsed as Lehman Brothers failed and financial markets ranging from U.S. stocks to European bonds plunged. TROUBLED WATERS: Colm Kelleher, Morgan Stanley's chief financial officer, said last year the firm would "stay close to shore." That prompted the bank to shrink its balance sheet, reduce leverage, and dump riskier businesses such as proprietary trading -- but rival Goldman Sachs later that year decided to dive back into riskier waters. In the latest quarter, Goldman reported shocking revenues of $6.8 billion in fixed income trading, while Morgan, sailing in the shallows, logged $973 million in fixed income trading revenue. SOUR DEALS: Morgan Stanley acquired subprime mortgage lender and servicing company Saxon Capital in December 2006, at the peak of the housing market, for $706 million as part of a plan to build up its mortgage business. After house prices tumbled across the country and credit markets largely shut down, the bank took a goodwill charge of $725 million related to the deal in December last year. The company paid $1.76 billion in 2006 for Goldfish, a credit card company, only to write down its value by $422 million late in 2007. In August 2007, Morgan Stanley purchased Crescent Real Estate. In June 2008, the bank took a $150 million write-down related to the investment. (Reporting by  Jonathan Spicer ,  Joseph A. Giannone ,  Elinor Comlay ; Editing by  Gary Hill )
