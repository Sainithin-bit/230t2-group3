 ZURICH  (Reuters) - Many of the 4,450 UBS customers whose account details will be passed over to the U.S. authorities as part of a tax settlement could come forward voluntarily, UBS's chairman was quoted as saying on Thursday. 

 "It is not possible at the moment to talk about numbers, but it is possible that it will be a considerable amount of cases," Kaspar Villiger said in an interview with Swiss magazine Schweizer Arbeitgeber. The United States is hoping many suspected U.S. tax evaders will voluntarily disclose their unreported overseas accounts as part of an amnesty programme that expires on September 23. Villiger also said he expected many of those UBS ( UBS.N ) ( UBSN.VX ) customers affected by the deal last month between Switzerland and the United States would forego any appeal to the Swiss Federal Administrative Court. Switzerland has agreed to reveal the names of some 4,450 wealthy American UBS clients to U.S. authorities. UBS is meanwhile struggling to retain clients who are taking their money to other banks. "We have still not been able to stop the outflows. I can't say when that will definitely be the case," Villiger was quoted saying. (Reporting by  Katie Reid ; Editing by  David Holmes )
