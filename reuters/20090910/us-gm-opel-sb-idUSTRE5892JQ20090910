 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - General Motors has decided in principle to sell its European carmaker Opel, two people familiar with the negotiations told Reuters on Thursday. 

 "They will sell it under conditions," one of the sources said. GM is set to end months of suspense over the fate of its Opel unit and announce whether it plans to sell the European carmaker to one of two rival bidders, Canadian automotive supplier Magna or financial investor RHJ. GM Europe had no comment. (Reporting by Phillip Halstrick and Angelika Gruber; Writing by  Maria Sheahan )
