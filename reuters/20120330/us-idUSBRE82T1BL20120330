 CALGARY, Alberta  (Reuters) - TransCanada Corp ( TRP.TO ) said on Friday it will concentrate its planning efforts for an Alaska natural gas pipeline on a $26 billion route that would take the fuel to an Alaska liquefied natural gas facility, leaving a more expensive route to Alberta as only an alternative option for the project. 
 Tony Palmer, TransCanada's vice-president of Alaska development, said in an interview that an all-Alaska route had become the preferred focus for the project following an agreement between producers on the state's North Slope and Alaska government. Exxon Mobil Corp ( XOM.N ), BP Plc ( BP.L ) and ConocoPhillips ( COP.N ) agreed to move forward on finding ways to commercialize their vast natural-gas reserves on the North Slope after Exxon Mobil resolved a dispute with the state government over the Point Thomson field.
