 COPENHAGEN  (Reuters) - The euro zone is well-placed to discuss further funds from the International Monetary Fund following a decision by the euro group on the firewall, French Finance Minister Francois Baroin said on Friday. 
 "After the deal on the firewall we are now in a position for discussion on the IMF in April," Baroin said at a meeting of European Union finance ministers in the Danish capital. "It is a good signal," Baroin said. (Reporting by  John Acher  and Francesca Landini)
