March 30 - Standard and Poor's downgrades Ireland's credit rating from AAA to AA+ and says it could drop further, in a sign of no-confidence in Dublin's efforts to get its public finances under control. Fitch strips Ireland of its AAA credit rating on April 8, reducing it to AA-plus.

August 25 - Standard and Poor's cuts Ireland's long-term rating by one notch to AA- and gives the country a negative outlook, a move criticized by the Irish debt management agency. September 30 - Ireland discloses a worst case price tag of more than 50 billion euros ($68 billion) for bailing out its banks and announces it will have to make more budget savings. October 6 - Fitch cuts Ireland's credit rating to A+ from AA-, citing the huge cost of cleaning up its banks. Fitch also puts its rating on negative outlook. November 3 - The government bows to pressure from its junior party and the High Court to hold a late November vote to fill parliamentary seats that could cut its majority to just two.

Nov 16 - Euro zone finance ministers agree to lay the groundwork for bailing out Ireland's banking sector with the IMF, but say Dublin has to decide itself whether to request the aid. It agreed to let EU, IMF and European Central Bank technical experts visit Ireland to look at how to deal with its banking problems. November 21 - EU finance ministers welcome an Irish request for EU financial aid as the loan program will safeguard the euro zone's financial stability. November 22 - EU and IMF officials begin working out details of the rescue package. -- Cowen's coalition partner, the Green Party, says it will support the government until the budget is passed and the EU/IMF bailout is in place, but will then leave the coalition.
