 DUBLIN  (Reuters) - Ireland's economic crisis has prompted calls for an overhaul of its political system and an end to a crony culture that helped to precipitate a devastating crash, forcing Dublin to negotiate an IMF/EU bailout. 

 The reckless lending and boardroom deals that led to Ireland's current woes have already prompted a shake-up in the country's corporate governance code, and many Irish people believe a similar change is needed in the halls of power. In his book "Enough is Enough: How to Build a New Republic," Irish journalist Fintan O'Toole said Ireland could not emerge from its current crisis without breaking the link between big business and politics. "There has been no attempt to deal with -- or even acknowledge -- the toxic nature of the intertwining of politics and banking, and thus no move to destroy the political culture that led to the crash," he said. During the go-go years of the "Celtic Tiger" economy, the governing Fianna Fail party's hospitality tent at the Galway horse races was a magnet for property developers. The image of government ministers partying with the developers whose loans have had to be underwritten by the state has left taxpayers fuming and Fianna Fail is set for a record kicking at the next general election, likely early next year. Compounding people's frustration is the sudden near implosion of the coalition government and the failure of opposition parties to support economic policies in the national interest. "They need to stop bickering, and put their heads together and do something for the Irish," said Joan Arkins, aged 46 who works in a Dunnes Department store in Dublin. "This farce of the government, and the opposition, is a disgrace." O'LEARY AS PM? Ireland's government hired a Briton, Matthew Elderfield, to take over as financial regulator last year after the failure of the previous incumbent to halt widespread reckless lending left the country with a reputation as the "Wild West" of Europe. Elderfield in turn has criticized the closed nature of Irish business and called for fresh blood in the financial services sector to prevent powerful executives from riding roughshod over corporate codes. "Poor governance has been exacerbated by the concentrated nature of corporate life in Ireland, with challenge and awkwardness in the board room blunted by the social constraints of working and living in a small business community in a small country," Elderfield said earlier this month. Many Irish people would like to see a similar infusion of fresh faces in the country's 166-seat parliament, which is dominated by dynasties. Prime Minister Brian Cowen and Finance Minister Brian Lenihan are both the sons of former MPs and Lenihan shares the chamber with his brother and his aunt. "We need a complete overhaul. We need to get the guys that are the best in the industry, the heads of the successful businesses in the private sector, like they are doing in Japan," said Jonathan, a 30-year old management consultant who declined to give his full name. Like many Irish people, Jonathan said Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary should be drafted in to help run the country. O'Leary, whose opinion of the country's politicians is regularly expressed in expletives, has ruled out entering politics. Ireland's constitution permits the prime minister to nominate two cabinet members from the senate, which would allow senators with business skills to be drafted it, but in practice cabinets tend to be comprised of MPs. Commentators and newspaper editorials have complained bitterly about the loss of sovereignty that an assistance package from the European Union and International Monetary Fund would entail. But on the streets of Dublin, many people were happy that someone else might be calling the shots in future. "The IMF is the best thing that ever happened ... they're going to clean up the Dail (parliament) from top to bottom," said Frank, 57, a builder. (Editing by Carmel Crimmins/David Stamp)
