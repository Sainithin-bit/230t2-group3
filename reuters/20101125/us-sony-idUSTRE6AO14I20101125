 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Sony Corp ( 6758.T ) plans to look for a new president who could eventually succeed Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Howard Stringer, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. 

 Stringer, the first foreigner to run the Japanese consumer electronics company and who took on the role of president in 2009 from Ryoji Chubachi, would retain the Chairman and CEO posts he has held since 2005, Bloomberg said. Welsh-born Stringer, who assumed the role of president amid a slump in sales and profitability, has described Sony as a series of disconnected silos that needed to better cooperate for a revival in fortunes. In the three months ended September 30, Sony reported operating profit of 68.7 billion yen ($822.6 million) following a loss the previous year. The company also lifted its annual profit forecast to 200 billion yen from 180 billion yen because of strong sales of PCs and PlayStation 3 game consoles.
