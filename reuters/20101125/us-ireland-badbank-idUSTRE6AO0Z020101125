 DUBLIN  (Reuters) - Ireland may create a second "bad bank" by merging the remaining operations of nationalized lenders, Anglo Irish Bank ANGIB.UL and building society Irish Nationwide IRNBS.UL, and using that entity to take bad loans from other banks, The Irish Times reported on Thursday. 

 Officials are exploring the possibility of moving the rump of Irish Nationwide into Anglo after both lenders transfer loans to the state-run National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) and using the merged entity to "cleanse" the other banks, the paper reported. Merging the post-NAMA operations of Irish Nationwide into Anglo Irish and running both down over time could send reassuring signals to the markets about their future, the newspaper said, citing sources familiar with the proposals. The merged entity could be used to take bad loans from Bank of Ireland ( BKIR.I ), Allied Irish Banks ( ALBK.I ), Irish Life & Permanent ( IPM.I ) and building society EBS EBSBS.UL Funding the merged Anglo-Irish Nationwide entity is seen as the most difficult part of the process, the newspaper said, although ECB funding drawn over a longer timeframe is being considered.
