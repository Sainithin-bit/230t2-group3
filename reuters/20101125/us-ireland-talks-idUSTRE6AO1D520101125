 DUBLIN  (Reuters) - Talks on an IMF/EU bailout for Ireland will likely be concluded by the start of next month, a spokesman for EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn said on Thursday. 

 "We hope that by the end of November, beginning of December that this work can be concluded successfully," Amadeu Altafaj told Irish state broadcaster RTE. (Reporting by Carmel Crimmins, editing by Mike Peacock)
