 PARIS  (Reuters) - Irish Finance Minister Brian Lenihan said on Wednesday he was confident the debt crisis in Ireland would not cause serious turmoil in the euro zone. 

 "I have absolutely no doubt that Ireland will not cause any serious dislocation in the euro zone," Lenihan told France 24 television, stressing that Ireland is a small country whose problems are being addressed by an EU financial aid package. Ireland promised on Wednesday to cut spending and raise taxes to combat its banking crisis and secure an international bailout, but drew accusations of overconfidence in assuming the crippled economy can grow. Lenihan, who was interviewed by France 24 on Wednesday afternoon, said the final size of the bailout was "still subject to negotiation," adding that he had already said it would be short of 100 billion euros. The interview was for broadcast later on Wednesday and an advance copy was supplied to Reuters. (Reporting by  Vicky Buffery ; Editing by  Hugh Lawson )
