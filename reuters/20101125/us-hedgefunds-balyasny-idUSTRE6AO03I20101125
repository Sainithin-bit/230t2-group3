 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Hedge fund Balyasny Asset Management confirmed it was subpoenaed by the U.S. federal government in a massive investigation into insider trading, a news website reported on Wednesday. 

 The website, Absolute Return + Alpha, quoted a letter Balyasny wrote to its investors. The Chicago-based fund did not return a telephone call made earlier on Wednesday. "Late Monday afternoon we received a faxed subpoena from the government requesting a broad set of general information for the last few years," the website quoted the fund's letter as saying. Balyasny added it was "quite comfortable with the credibility of our processes and of our employees." In subpoenas served on several hedge funds and mutual funds with billions of dollars under management, authorities have asked for information about so-called "soft dollar" deals, an arrangement in which a hedge fund client executes trades through a designated brokerage that has some relationship with an expert networking firm. Expert networking firms take fees to match up hedge funds with experts in particular industries such as medicine, engineering and technology.
