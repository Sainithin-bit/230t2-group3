 LONDON  (Reuters) - Ireland's damaged government this week set out its four-year plan to impose further austerity measures to rein in a deficit and win an IMF and EU rescue -- but key political hurdles remain. 

 Minority coalition partner the Greens say they will pull support from Prime Minister Brian Cowen's Fianna Fael-led government after the legislation underpinning a December 7 budget is passed, ushering in early elections in the Spring. But budget approval is far from a foregone conclusion, and popular anger is growing. Ireland had been praised by investors and EU policymakers for making tough spending cuts early, but the scale of their real estate crash and resulting banking crisis proved their undoing. Bond yields have risen to unsustainable levels and the Irish crisis has also undermined the euro. Irish bonds, credit default swaps and stocks will likely prove most vulnerable to political uncertainty in the coming weeks, but the single currency and bonds of other fringe Eurozone borrowers such as Greece, Portugal and Spain may also move on Irish developments. Below are the key political risks for markets to watch in the coming weeks: THE BUDGET Cowen's government aims to make 15 billion euros in savings through spending cuts and tax hikes between 2011 and 2014. Personal tax levels will increase, minimum wages will fall, social welfare will be reduced and public sector staff numbers will be reduced. Despite opposition demands for the budget vote to be moved forward, the government says it is committed to holding it on December 7. That means markets could face more than a week of political maneuvering with no certainty the measures will be passed. Any failure of the budget vote would jeopardize any IMF/EU bailout and further alarm markets, as well as bring down the government. However, the opposition Fine Gael party say the European Commission has told them any future government can amend the four-year plan. They will unveil their own budgetary strategy next week. What to watch: -- What does Fine Gael party do? If they agree to abstain or support the budget, there is little question that it will pass. If they choose to oppose it the government will need the support of every coalition MP including two independents who have already said they might not vote for it. So far, Fine Gael have simply said they are considering their options -- although they have raised doubts the government can even survive as far as the budget vote. Fine Gael's own budget strategy next week will also be closely watched -- although in reality they are seen as having little room for maneuver. -- Are the proposals themselves enough to placate investors, the European Union and the IMF? The EU and IMF could demand further action as a condition for their bailout, although some analysts suggest they are unlikely to do so at least until after any election. If markets are convinced, they could take some of the immediate pressure off Ireland -- although possibly not other troubled Eurozone states such as Portugal. EARLY ELECTIONS Most analysts now believe Cowen's government is on its last legs, but there is still little clarity on when elections might take place. The Greens say they want them in January 2011, while opposition parties have generally said they them want sooner. By holding onto the December 7 budget date, Cowen may be hoping to hold them off until after Christmas. Opinion polls suggest the coalition will be punished heavily. Investors would broadly welcome a new government with a stronger popular mandate, and some analysts say elections might allow the population to show their outrage at the government and reduce the threat of social unrest. At the same time, investors face the risk a new government might renegotiate both the budget and IMF/EU deal. What to watch: -- The budget date. If Cowen is forced to bring the budget vote forwards, that would shorten the period before any election. From a market point of view, the best outcome would be a shorter election campaign as possible bringing the period of uncertainty to a minimum. -- The outcome of any election. Markets would want to see an outright majority for the winner -- most likely Fine Gael and its Labour allies. Put bluntly, the more conclusive the election result, the better markets will likely take it. SOCIAL UNREST Ireland saw a day of widespread but peaceful street protest last year when austerity measures were first introduced, and since then occasional very small-scale clashes between handfuls of protesters and police. Despite mounting anger, so far there has been nothing on the scale of sometimes violent clashes seen in Greece. Thousands are expected to march on Saturday in a major protest in Dublin, but union leaders have said they expect little in the way of unrest. So far, most Irish have seemed mournfully resigned and few currently expect any displays of outrage that could seriously affect policy. What to watch: -- If Ireland falls behind in its budget targets a public sector deal agreed between government and the unions could be up for re-negotiation. This could prompt further strike action. -- Any early election or change of government is seen likely taking some of the steam out of protests. Any sustained ongoing post-election protest next year or serious unrest might prompt investors to question whether reforms were sustainable, potentially undermining assets. CORPORATION TAX, RELATIONS WITH EU There is still little clarity on exactly what the IMF and EU in particular are demanding as preconditions for the bailout. Germany in particular is seen wanting Ireland to increase its 12.5 percent corporation tax, one of the lowest in the continent -- and a prime factor in many international firms such as Google locating in Ireland. The government made it clear on Wednesday that the 12.5 percent rate would stay in place, describing it as an issue of national sovereignty. But after any election, any Irish government may come under mounting pressure to raise it -- possibly also coming from an angry electorate who otherwise will have to make up the tax burden themselves. What to watch: -- Comments from key European leaders particularly German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Any signs of major companies warning they will relocate away from Ireland if the corporate tax rate increases. (Editing by Carmel Crimmins)
