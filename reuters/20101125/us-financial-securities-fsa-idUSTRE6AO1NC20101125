 LONDON  (Reuters) - There is no turning back the clock on ultra-fast share trading which has brought benefits but brokers must have equally fast brakes to keep the system safe, a senior British regulator said on Thursday. 

 Alexander Justham, director of markets at the Financial Services Authority, said the "flash crash" which sent U.S. shares briefly into freefall in May has put heavy political focus on high frequency and other forms of computerized trading. "We are not here to turn the clock back," Justham told a TradeTech 2010 markets industry conference. Computerized trading and a subsect known as high-frequency trading (HFT) is where a huge number of trades are transacted in microseconds. Justham said HFT has narrowed bid offer spreads but the jury is out on whether trading was more efficient. "We are absolutely not complacent about the general risk of what all this means," Justham said. HFT has come to represent a third of trading on the London Stock Exchange ( LSE.L ) and proponents say this has helped boost liquidity in markets. European Union share trading rules, known as markets in financial instruments directive or MiFID, introduced in November 2007 have sparked competition in share trading, greater use of computerized trading and fragmentation of markets. The EU's executive European Commission is due to present legislative amendments to MiFID by next summer with the European Parliament and EU governments having the final say. Justham said that the review should look at tougher limits on "carve outs" for some firms from MiFID's transparency rules and look at forcing a wider spectrum of trading firms to report trades so that regulators have a full picture of the market. Trading firms may also need to "stress test" their computerized trading models or algorithms before they go live. Justham later told Reuters that any policy changes for markets in Britain would come under the umbrella of the MiFID review but there could be changes in the way the FSA supervises the domestic market in the meantime.
