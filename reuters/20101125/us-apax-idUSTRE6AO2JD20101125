 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Private equity firm Apax Partners LLP APAX.UL said on Thursday that funds it is advising have agreed to buy a majority stake in marketing agency Advantage Sales & Marketing ADSAM.UL from buyout firm J.W. Childs Associates LP and a unit of Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ). 

 The companies did not disclose terms of the deal. But a Bloomberg report earlier in the day estimated the transaction to be worth $1.8 billion, citing a person familiar with the matter. Apax and ASM said they expect the deal to close by the end of 2010. ASM's leadership team will continue to manage the company's day-to-day operations after the deal closes. ASM, which helps market products, process orders and display products on store shelves and serves clients such as Kroger ( KR.N ) and Unilever ( ULVR.L ), estimated its 2010 revenues at about $1 billion. ASM generated earnings before tax, interest and amortization of $180 million this year, according to the person cited by Bloomberg. In a statement, Apax partner Alex Pellegrini said ASM was well positioned to take advantage of growing outsourcing of marketing efforts by consumer products companies and a greater emphasis on in-store marketing. ASM CEO Sonny King said Apax's expertise in retail would help create opportunities for growth. In March, Apax sold fashion brand Tommy Hilfiger to Phillips-Van Heusen ( PVH.N ), owner of the Calvin Klein brand, for $3 billion in a cash-and-stock deal.
