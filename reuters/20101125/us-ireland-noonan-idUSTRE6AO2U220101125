 DUBLIN  (Reuters) - Ireland's main opposition party said on Thursday the European Commission would demand tougher fiscal measures next year than in later years as part of a proposed 85 billion euro bailout package. 

 Fine Gael's finance spokesman Michael Noonan -- who is likely to be the country's next Finance Minister -- said conditions attached to the bailout package would be most stringent in 2011 and criticized the Commission, the European Union's executive arm, for mandating proposals at all. "The memo of understanding which is going to accompany the bailout agreement with Europe, I understand now is going to be quite specific ... about 2011 ... and less specific about the following years but still specific," Noonan told parliament. "There will be items included which effectively will be mandated ... I want to tell the Commission we are not a colony, we are a sovereign government. "They should not be advocating solutions to Ireland that are beyond the scope of the treaties," he said. Fine Gael, a center-right party, is likely to lead a new government if a general election is held next year, possibly in February or March. Noonan said on Thursday that a new government should not be bound to any conditions of the loan, which will be used to shore up Ireland's banking system and public finances. "I don't think a new government should be tied to the specifics of a plan which is negotiated by an outgoing government," said Noonan. The Commission told Fine Gael earlier this week that terms of a four-year plan for cutting the country's deficit, which were outlined on Wednesday, could be renegotiated. "If the budget goes through obviously that changes the status of the specifics for 2011, but for the subsequent years we will sit down with the Commission and renegotiate the specifics and we will not accept any other arrangement with the commission," said Noonan.
