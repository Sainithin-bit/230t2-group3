 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Verizon Communications ( VZ.N ) and union workers agreed on a new labor contract on Sunday, avoiding a strike that could have delayed the roll-out of the phone company's FiOS Internet and video service. 

 Verizon said it has reached tentative agreements on three-year contracts with the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. The two unions represent about 65,000 employees. The tentative agreement will be presented to covered employees as part of the ratification process. The contracts include wage increases that total 10.5 percent over three years, said Verizon in a statement. Union leaders and Verizon had failed to strike an agreement last week, and had extended talks, setting Sunday night as the new deadline. "Ten years ago (a strike) would have been inconvenient to the customers, but since they had no other place to go, Verizon would not have lost business," Jeff Kagan, an independent telecommunications analyst wrote in a research note. "However, today the customer increasingly has choice. If they want, today's customers can give their business to one of Verizon's competitors and walk away from Verizon altogether." Verizon has about 103,000 workers in its telecom unit which provides residential and small business telephone, broadband and video services. Investors were watching closely as a walk-out would have delayed the expansion of FiOS, Verizon's effort to compete with Time Warner Cable ( TWC.N ) and Cablevision ( CVC.N ) by offering television along with high-speed Internet and voice services. Verizon launched its FiOS TV service in New York City on July 28. The network expansion, for which Verizon is spending $22.9 billion from 2004 through 2010, is labor intensive. The last time Verizon workers walked out was in 2000 when about 85,000 workers went on strike for about three weeks. The tentative agreement preserves fully paid health-care premiums for all active and retired employees, while future hires will have a defined contribution formula for retirement health care, with the amount of Verizon's contributions subject to negotiation in each subsequent contract.
