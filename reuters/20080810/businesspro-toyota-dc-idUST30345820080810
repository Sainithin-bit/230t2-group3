 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ) will raise 
prices of hybrid cars and commercial vehicles by 1-3 percent in 
Japan as early as this year amid soaring raw material costs, 
the Nikkei business daily reported on Monday. 

  The paper said Toyota would leave the prices of mainstay 
models such as the Corolla and Crown sedans untouched, fearing 
across-the-board price increases would further affect domestic 
demand, which is already weakening.  Toyota will make an official announcement of the price hike 
this month, and it will likely affect models such as the Prius 
hybrid car and the Dyna truck, the paper said.  Toyota's decision to raise prices may encourage Nissan 
Motor Co ( 7201.T ) and other rivals to follow the suit, it said.  Toyota officials were not immediately available for 
comment.  (Reporting by Sachi Izumi; Editing by  Michael Watson )
