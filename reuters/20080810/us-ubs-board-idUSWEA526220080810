 ZURICH  (Reuters) - UBS ( UBSN.VX ) is to elect Swiss Life ( SLHN.VX ) Chairman Bruno Gehrig to the board of directors of the Swiss bank, Swiss media reported on Sunday. 

 Zurich Financial Services ( ZURN.VX ) Chief Executive James Schiro has also been asked, Swiss newspaper Sonntag reported, citing unnamed sources. SonntagsZeitung reported further candidates for election at the bank's extraordinary general meeting on October 2 will include two banking experts from the United States as well as one more Swiss person, also citing unnamed sources. UBS, which has taken $37 billion in writedowns since the credit crisis began, the largest of any bank in Europe, will also announce plans to restructure the bank in a bid to make the bank profitable by 2009, Sonntag reported. The bank, which is seen posting another quarterly loss, is likely to say that it will reduce the size of its investment banking arm and focus on private banking, the paper reported. In April, UBS signaled it would cut its investment bank to a rump after lost bets in subprime mortgages made it one of the biggest casualties of the global credit crisis. On Friday, UBS said it had agreed to buy back $18.6 billion of debt securities whose value collapsed during the global financial crisis and to pay $150 million to settle charges it misled investors. Including fines and writedowns of auction-rate debt it will redeem, the settlement will cost the Swiss bank $900 million before taxes, which it will book in second-quarter earnings, UBS said in a statement. UBS declined to comment on the reports. (Reporting by  Katie Reid ; Editing by  Jason Neely )
