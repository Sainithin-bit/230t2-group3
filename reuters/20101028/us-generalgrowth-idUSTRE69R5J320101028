 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - General Growth Properties Inc ( GGP.N ) named Sandeep Mathrani, Vornado Realty Trust's ( VNO.N ) former president of its retail unit, to become the No. 2 U.S. mall owner's new chief executive officer after it emerges from bankruptcy next month, the company said on Thursday. 

 Mathrani will assume the position in the beginning of next year. He will succeed Adam Metz, who served as CEO during the company's bankruptcy process. Although General Growth said Mathrani "was previously" president of Vornado's retail division, it was unclear whether he was still with the company. A representative of Vornado declined comment. Vornado is chiefly an owner of office buildings, but it has 164 retail properties totaling 22.7 million square feet overseen by Mathrani. Of those properties, 14 are malls, including Kings Plaza Shopping Center in Brooklyn New York; Monmouth Mall in Eatontown, New Jersey; and The Cannery in San Francisco. Much of Vornado's retail properties consist of smaller shopping centers throughout the country as well as street-level stores located in office buildings in Manhattan. Mathrani joined Vornado in 2002 following eight years at Forest City Ratner, where he was executive vice president of retail development and leasing in the New York metropolitan area. Last month, Chicago-based General Growth, said it would replace its two top executives, Metz and President and Chief Operating Officer Thomas Nolan, who guided the company through its bankruptcy, when it emerged from Chapter 11 protection. Metz and Nolan, who were board members for at least the past five years, were named to their positions in November 2008, several months before the company filed for bankruptcy on April 16, 2009. General Growth is set to exit bankruptcy around November 8 with new board of directors. It will emerge as two companies, one which will house 185 retail properties most of which are malls. The other, the Howard Hughes Corp, will be comprised of its master-planned residential community business, as well as its development and other non-income producing properties. The company's shares closed down 8 cents at $16.49. (Reporting by  Ilaina Jonas ; editing by  Andre Grenon ,  Bernard Orr )
