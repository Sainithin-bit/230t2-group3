 SEOUL  (Reuters) - South Korea's LG Electronics Inc ( 066570.KS ) reported a record quarterly operating loss, as its struggling handset business slid deeper into the red on a lack of blockbuster smartphones, and as growing competition hit earnings from TVs. 

 The world's No.2 TV maker and No.3 handset vendor on Thursday posted a July-September operating loss of 185 billion won ($163.7 million), versus a 851 billion won profit a year ago and in line with a consensus forecast of a 185 billion won loss by 18 analysts polled by Reuters. Losses from the handset business snowballed to a record 304 billion won and margins plunged to a negative 10.2 percent, hit by a weak smartphone lineup and growing development and marketing costs to prop up faltering sales of low-priced models. LG, none of whose smartphones have hit the one million unit sales mark, hopes Optimus One launched this month will help turn around its weakest business area. But analysts warn the unit would report a third straight quarterly loss in the December period amid intensifying competition. Shares in LG, which trails Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ) and Samsung Electronics ( 005930.KS ) in handsets and competes with Sony Corp ( 6758.T ) and Panasonic Corp ( 6752.T ) in flat-screen TVs, have fallen 17 percent so far this year, versus a 14 percent gain in the wider market  .KS11 .
