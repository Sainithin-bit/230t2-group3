 LANSING  (Reuters) - General Motors Co GM.UL will continue to be profitable and do its "level best" to repay American taxpayers for the $50 billion, U.S.-government funded restructuring of the automaker, Chief Executive Officer Dan Akerson said on Thursday. 

 "We have seen we've become profitable the last several quarters," Akerson said in a speech at a plant in Lansing, Michigan, on Thursday. "We hope to continue that. We will continue that." Akerson said GM was too big to let fail, rather than too big to fail. "It's up to people like you and me, the burden we share, that we deliver on the promise and return the investment to the American taxpayers," Akerson told workers at the plant. "We are going to do our level best to make that happen, and we will only do that by expanding our industrial base and entering new markets and being a better competitor." Akerson announced that GM would make a $190 million investment to build a small luxury car for the Cadillac brand at its Lansing Grand River assembly plant. The new small car is aimed at competing with BMW ( BMWG.DE ) and Mercedes sedans. The automaker has about 1,100 hourly and salaried workers at the Lansing plant that build the Cadillac CTS and STS cars on a single shift. GM hopes to add a second shift and 600 jobs at the plant for the small car, Akerson said. GM has made $3 billion of investments in 21 U.S. facilities since it emerged from bankruptcy in July 2009, Akerson said. (Reporting by  David Bailey ; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
