 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Online brokerage E*Trade Financial Corp said on Thursday it is not currently routing trades to Knight Capital, which suffered a trading glitch a day earlier that roiled markets and wiped out $440 million of Knight's capital. 
 E*Trade said it would be assessing the situation on a daily basis." Knight said in a statement earlier that it is "actively pursuing its strategic and financing alternatives." (Reporting By  John McCrank ; editing by Carol Bishopric)
