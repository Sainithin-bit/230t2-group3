 (Reuters) - American International Group still faces challenges as it looks to complete the $2.16 billion sale of its Taiwan unit, Nan Shan, not least from Taiwan's picky regulators, who have laid down five strict conditions. 

 AIG will formally submit the agreement with the buyer group, called Ruen Chen Investment and made up of retailer Ruentex Industries Ltd and shoe maker Pou Chen Corp, to regulators, who have said they will review it according to the five conditions. AIG says Ruen Chen meets the criteria, but regulatory sources have told Reuters that concerns remain. Analysts say the regulatory process could take three to six months. Below are details of how the bidder group stacks up against the conditions. * Criteria 1: fund-raising ability for future operations Ruen Chen said it has a funding plan for the next 20 years. Analysts suggest that considering the size of parent Ruentex, it should have easy access to market funds. However Taiwan's insurers may need to prepare for huge reserves should Taiwan decide to adopt new IFRS 4 accounting rules in the future. * Criteria 2: a long-term commitment to run Nan Shan Ruen Chen said it would not sell Nan Shan in the next 10 years and would study an IPO, something the regulators have previously suggested for the insurer. * Criteria 3: experience in running an insurance business Samuel Yin, head of the buyer group and also chairman of parent Ruentex Group, owned Antai Life Insurance for 17 years, but analysts said regulators may see that as purely a financial investment so Yin might find it hard to make a case. A previous bid for Nan Shan by Hong Kong investment firm Primus and battery maker China Strategic was rejected last year on this criteria. * Criteria 4: taking care of employees and policy holders The buyer has agreed to maintain existing compensation and benefits packages for employees and its agency organization and commission structure. Ruen Chen will also retain the current management team, and hinted at future employee share ownership plans and enhanced compensation packages. * Criteria 5: funding sources that meet Taiwan regulations This is an oblique reference to any funding from mainland China, still a no-no in Taiwan's financial industry despite better ties between the two political rivals. Ruen Chen said it has no mainland money behind it, and will buy Nan Shan with its own cash, syndicated bank loans and a convertible bond issued overseas. Analysts said the bond plan may raise concerns with the regulator because of uncertainty over who might buy it, with mainland buyers a possibility.
