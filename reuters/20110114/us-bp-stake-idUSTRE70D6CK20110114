 LONDON  (Reuters) - Russia's Rosneft ( ROSN.MM ) is to take a "pretty significant stake" in oil major BP Plc ( BP.L ), Sky television news said on Friday. 

 "That is probably going to be around 5 percent, I understand, though the details were still be finalized today," its reporter Mark Kleinman said. BP invited reporters to a press conference, to be addressed by Chief Executive Bob Dudley and scheduled for 2100 GMT on Friday, at its headquarters in London a few hours before the event. BP, Europe's third-largest listed oil company by market capitalization, earlier said Dudley was in Moscow on Friday for a "routine" meeting with Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. BP's CEO travels to Russia once every quarter for meetings with officials. (Writing by  Avril Ormsby ; Editing by  Gary Hill )
