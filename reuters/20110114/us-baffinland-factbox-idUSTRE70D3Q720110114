 TORONTO  (Reuters) - Two rival bidders for Baffinland Iron Mines have joined forces in a C$590 million ($595 million) joint takeover offer for the company, ending a months-long fight over its huge iron ore deposit in the Canadian Arctic. 

 ArcelorMittal, the world's largest steelmaker, and Nunavut Iron, backed by U.S. private equity, on Friday made a joint C$1.50 a share offer for 100 percent of Baffinland, with 393.4 million shares outstanding, fully diluted. Baffinland was little known outside of mining circles until a few months ago. Its massive Mary River deposit in the northern Canadian territory of Nunavut is said to contain enough iron ore to supply the needs of all of Europe and it lies relatively close to the continent. Still, the project has its challenges, located in hostile terrain on Baffin Island above the Arctic Circle, and development costs are estimated at C$4 billion ($4 billion). Following are some facts about the Mary River project: * The site was discovered in 1962 by Murray Watts of British Ungava Explorations Ltd (Brunex), and Baffinland Iron's predecessor company was established in 1963 by the backers and prospectors of Brunex. * Baffinland started exploration at Mary River in 2004. * Mary River is located at the northern end of Baffin Island about 160 km (100 miles) south of the hamlet of Pond Inlet, Nunavut. * The open pit project is expected to produce about 18 million tons of iron ore a year when it is first built, and analysts say output could almost double relatively quickly. * Nine deposits at Mary River so far identified are thought to contain some 450 million tons of iron ore, of which 75 percent could be high grade. * Once built, Baffinland expects Mary River to operate year-round for at least 21 years. * A 143 km (90 mile) rail and road link is being considered to connect the proposed mines to a port at Steensby Inlet, south of Mary River, where chartered ice-breaking ore carriers would transport the ore to markets year-round. ( here ) * The Steensby port is 3,100 nautical miles from the key destination of Rotterdam in Europe, compared with 5,000 nautical miles from Brazil to Rotterdam. * The area, within the Arctic Circle, experiences darkness 24 hours a day from November to January and sunlight 24 hours a day between May and August. * The region has less than 200 mm annual precipitation and an annual average temperature of about -15 Celsius (5 Fahrenheit). * Baffinland owns leases that cover about 1,593 hectares (3,937 acres) and are renewable beyond the current 21-year period expiring August 27, 2013.
