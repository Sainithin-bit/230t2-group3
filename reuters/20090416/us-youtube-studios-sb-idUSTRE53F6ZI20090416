 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Google Inc's YouTube video sharing site has signed content deals with several Hollywood studios, according to two sources familiar with the matter on Thursday. 

 The move reflects Google's efforts to ramp up YouTube to attract more advertising dollars. It also represents a thawing in the chilly relationship between YouTube and Hollywood, which has criticized the site for posting unauthorized content in the past.
