 BEIJING  (Reuters) - China's State Council, or cabinet, said the economy is in better shape than expected as stimulus measures have started to show positive results, the official Xinhua news agency reported on Thursday. 

 The summary of the cabinet meeting, chaired by Premier Wen Jiabao, also warned against "blind optimism" after China reported that annual growth in the first quarter was 6.1 percent, the lowest since quarterly growth records began in 1992.
