 MILAN  (Reuters) - Italian insurer Assicurazioni Generali could be interested in small niche acquisitions but is not interested in bigger purchases, Chief Executive Giovanni Perissinotto said on Thursday. 

 Perissinotto excluded any interest in acquisitions in the United States, adding the group is not interested in any AIG assets. "We are not looking at anything since we want to see greater stabilization of the markets," he said on the sidelines of a conference. (Reporting by Gianluca Semeraro and Nigel Tutt)
