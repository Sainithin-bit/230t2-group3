 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co and Wells Fargo & Co shares command premium valuations, particularly after a recent rally, but many analysts wonder if worsening loan losses will bring these stocks back to earth. 

 The two banks, which have largely avoided the mistakes that have hobbled rivals Bank of America Corp and Citigroup Inc, are now the two largest U.S. lenders by market value. JPMorgan and Wells Fargo are seen as among the few strong big banks left, which could help them acquire even more troubled assets with regulators' blessings. Investors are awarding them with some of the highest valuations in the financial sector. Wells Fargo trades at about 1.3 times its book price, or accounting value, while JPMorgan trades at 0.85 times. Most of their competitors trade at less than 0.7 times book value. These valuations have only been helped by Wells Fargo's report last week that it expected to earn a record $3 billion in the first quarter. JPMorgan reported better-than-expected first-quarter profit on Thursday. Both banks benefited from a refinancing boom in the first quarter and an uptick in capital markets activity after a brutal fourth quarter. But analysts caution that these benefits may not last. Credit trends seem to be worsening as unemployment skyrockets. And there may be the risk of shareholder dilution ahead. Both have said they would like to pay back the cash infusions the government forced them to take. If results of regulatory stress tests convince investors that they can withstand a severe recession, the two banks may then have the ability to raise capital on their own to repay the government. Goldman Sachs Group showed the danger to investors of further capital raising on Tuesday after its shares fell more than 11 percent following a $5 billion equity offering, although they remain up 41 percent so far this year. "It feels like the economy may have turned a corner, but it might not rise in a straight line, and there could be more left to the story of consumer weakness," said Ralph Cole, portfolio manager at Ferguson Wellman Capital Management in Portland, Oregon. "You have to wonder how much more expensive these shares can get," Cole added. Ferguson Wellman recently sold Wells Fargo shares, but may buy JPMorgan shares if they fall enough, because the company is more diversified than Wells Fargo. Since a market low on March 6, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo shares have more than doubled as the S&P 500 has rallied 26 percent, driven in part by several bank chief executives including JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon saying that January and February were profitable months. MORE LEFT TO THE STORY But Dimon also said that March was tougher, and both Wells Fargo and JPMorgan could continue to wrestle with their large consumer loan exposure -- JPMorgan has about $482 billion of total consumer loan exposure, while Wells Fargo has about $475 billion, including credit cards, mortgages and other loans. While consumer loan exposure may hurt the shares of all banks, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo may have further to fall because of their premium valuations. To be sure, with the U.S. government committed to supporting the banking sector and a flurry of wider initiatives to lift the U.S. economy out of a year-long recession, both Wells Fargo and JPMorgan are expected to report stronger earnings this year compared with 2008, excluding one-time items. Some analysts believe the recent rally could be sustained. Both banks have undergone massive transformations through acquisitions in the last year. JPMorgan bought the assets of failed thrift Washington Mutual in October and Wells Fargo acquired large rival Wachovia at the end of the year. JPMorgan reported net income fell to $2.1 billion, or 40 cents a share, for the three months ended March 31, down from $2.37 billion or 67 cents a share for the same period a year ago. Revenue rose 50 percent to $29.9 billion. But beyond economic concerns, the stress tests could create problems for bank shares. The government is due to complete its stress tests of banking companies in the next few weeks. . "Until the stress test (results) are known ... I don't think these stocks are going to double again," said Ben Wallace, analyst at Grimes & Company. "The main overhang right now is whether there'll be some dilutive issuance," he added. "You have to wonder what the upside is for someone like a Wells Fargo over the next 12 months," Ferguson Wellman's Cole said. (Additional reporting by  Dan Wilchins ) (Editing by Steve Orlofsky)
