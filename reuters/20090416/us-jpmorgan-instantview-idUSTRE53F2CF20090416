 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co on Thursday said first-quarter profit fell, as the deepening recession and rising unemployment hurt its consumer banking business, although they beat analysts' estimates. 

 Net income fell to $2.1 billion, or 40 cents a share, for the three months ended March 31, down from $2.37 billion or 67 cents a share for the same period a year ago. Revenue rose 50 percent to $29.9 billion. JPMorgan shares were down 2.1 percent in electronic premarket trading. The following is reaction from industry analysts and investors: MICHAEL HOLLAND, FOUNDER, HOLLAND & CO, NEW YORK: "It's buy on the rumor, sell on the news. People expected Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan to outperform this quarter after the Wells Fargo results, and they did. "Now it's time to take profits. You have the continuing concerns that things are still dicey for the consumer. The provision for loan losses asnd the comments about future provisions show why people are concerned." CHRIS HOSSAIN, SENIOR SALES MANAGER, ODL SECURITIES, LONDON "The headline figure from JP Morgan is certainly reassuring, with EPS coming in above analysts' expectations at 40 cents. The key ingredient will be how the market compares these results versus peers Goldman and Wells Fargo. Comments from CEO Jamie Dimon may well prove to be the catalyst for impetus to the upside." JONATHAN MONK, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER AT AERION FUND  MANAGEMENT IN LONDON "The results are good, like Goldman's. What is encouraging is their good quality -- they probably added the correct amount to their credit reserves." "All the way along they had been performing better than the other banks. We own the stock." "The (sector) results we have seen so far have been better than expected, but I'm not sure about the quality." STEPHEN POPE, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST AT CANTOR FITZGERALD,  LONDON "Generally, they were much better than anticipated... The sentiment seems to be that they are making profit and gaining market share in every single strand of activities that they are up to. The fact that this is an institution that all the way along says, we don't need TARP money, we don't want TARP money. It works through in a very good order. I take that as a very encouraging signal." PETER CARDILLO, CHIEF MARKET ECONOMIST AT AVALON PARTNERS, IN NEW YORK "On the surface right now the stock is indicating a little bit higher but I suspect what we'll see is a cautious opening here as these earnings are digested. Of course we have other economic indicators coming out today - jobless claims, housing starts and the Philadelphia Fed. I suspect the housing starts and the JPMorgan earnings could be the market movers for today. However, right now we're indicating just slightly higher in the averages and the reason for that is the market is probably going to wait and see what JP Morgan has to say in the conference call."
