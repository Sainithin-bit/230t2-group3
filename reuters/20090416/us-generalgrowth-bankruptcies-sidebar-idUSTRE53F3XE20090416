 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - General Growth Properties Inc, the second-largest U.S. mall owner, filed for bankruptcy protection on Thursday as the credit crisis claimed its biggest real estate victim. 

 The company has assets of $29.56 billion and total debts of $27.29 billion, according to its bankruptcy petition. General Growth has warned since November that it may have to seek protection from its creditors because it was unable to refinance maturing mortgages.
