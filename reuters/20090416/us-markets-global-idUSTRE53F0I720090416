 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Global stocks rose and bond prices fell on Thursday after better-than-expected results from JPMorgan and regional U.S. manufacturing data that pointed to a less drastic contraction gave investors a reason to cheer. 

 European shares rose to a two-month high, also boosted by the outlook given by cellphone maker Nokia, but U.S. equity gains were muted, with the Dow up slightly as bleak data from around the world reminded investors that any signs of economic recovery were still tentative. The Nasdaq and the S&P 500, however, got a lift from Nokia and other techs, as well as from JPMorgan's earnings. The dollar and yen rose against the euro and while oil edged higher toward $50 a barrel, gains were limited because of mixed U.S. and Chinese economic data. China posted its weakest quarter for growth since quarterly records began in 1992, while weak U.S. housing data and record jobless claims reflected the downturn's tenacity. In a harsh reminder the recession is not over, General Growth Properties Inc ( GGP.N ), the second-largest U.S. mall owner, declared bankruptcy in the biggest real estate failure in U.S. history. But a slew of positive news on the technology front and JPMorgan's ( JPM.N ) earnings lifted Wall Street's S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, as well as European equities. JPMorgan's stock rose 2.4 percent. The world's top cellphone maker Nokia ( NOK1V.HE )( NOK.N ) said a drop in demand for its products was stabilizing, sending its shares up 9 percent in New York. Video game publisher Activision Blizzard Inc ( ATVI.O ) said first-quarter results were better than expected, lifting its shares 3.1 percent. "Your more cyclical, economically sensitive areas have been leading the way," said Henry Smith, chief investment officer at Haverford Trust Co in Philadelphia. "That gives us further confidence in making the claim the economy has bottomed, and that markets are looking for improvement in the economy." After midday, the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was up 10.03 points, or 0.12 percent, at 8,039.65. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was up 4.22 points, or 0.50 percent, at 856.28.. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was up 21.32 points, or 1.31 percent, at 1,648.12. In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of top shares ended up 1.8 percent at 802.02 points, the highest closing level since February 11. Results from JPMorgan and Nokia boosted European markets, as did Swiss drugmaker Roche ( ROG.VX ), which brushed off the downturn in the first quarter. Roche posted a 7 percent rise in sales and sounded a confident note for the full year. Roche gained 1.8 percent. "We are getting a much better view in terms of what's happening at the corporate level," said Henk Potts, strategist at Barclays Stockbrokers. "While it's not positive, it's certainly not as gloomy as many market participants had feared," Potts said. U.S. and euro zone government bond prices fell after the upbeat corporate results boosted equities and cut the appetite for less risky fixed-income assets. U.S. Treasury prices fell after the Federal Reserve purchased fewer inflation-protected bonds than it has in recent operations, buying just $1.5 billion of the $15.6 billion submitted by dealers. The Bund market was also pushed lower by more than 11 billion euros ($14.48 billion) of new French and Spanish bond issuance, which met good demand, easing immediate fears about oversupply as governments fund an array of stimulus packages. A contraction in U.S. factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region slowed in April, according to a survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, helping push bond prices down. "The industrial recession continues, though at a less intense pace than in the early part of the year," said Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell 15/32 in price to yield 2.82 percent. The 2-year U.S. Treasury note fell 2/32 in price to yield 0.89 percent. But the U.S. dollar rose against a basket of major currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index .DXY up 0.28 percent at 85.136. The euro fell 0.20 percent to $1.3193, but against the yen, the dollar slipped 0.10 percent to 99.29. "The general theme is a slight rise in risk aversion that was triggered by the disappointing Chinese GDP data and soft euro-zone economic figures overnight," said Omer Esiner, forex market analyst at Ruesch International in Washington. U.S. light sweet crude oil rose 38 cents to $49.64 a barrel. Spot gold prices fell $12.05 to $878.55 an ounce. Asian stocks pulled back from a six-month high, with the MSCI index of Asia-Pacific stocks outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS gaining 0.08 percent. Japan's Nikkei average  .N225  rose as much as 3.3 percent at one point but ended the session up just 0.1 percent.
