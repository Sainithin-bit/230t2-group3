 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Americans are growing less pessimistic about the recession-hit U.S. economy's prospects, but they remain worried about job security, a Gallup survey showed on Thursday. 

 Gallup's Consumer Mood Index -- a gauge of economic conditions and outlook, improved to minus 58 in mid-April, the best reading since early January 2008, from minus 120 in early March. About 37 percent of the 1,000 people who participated in the survey, conducted April 11-14, said economic conditions were getting better. This was the best showing since mid-September 2008, when the financial crisis blew out, Gallup said. Recent economic data have pointed to an easing in the pace of economic contraction, giving way to cautious optimism of some recovery later this year. The economy has been in recession since December 2007. Americans were also feeling better about their own economic situation, but remain worried about losing their jobs. About 43 percent of the respondents said their living conditions were getting better, matching a reading last seen at the start of September 2008. Despite these positive signs, employees' views of the jobs situation at their places of work and consumer spending remained negative, according to the Gallup Poll Daily tracking results. "That said, the fact that Americans are increasingly positive about their personal standard of living suggests that the more nebulous elements of consumer psychology may begin to translate to tangible results," Gallup said.
