 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - New U.S. housing starts fell more than expected in March after a surprise surge the previous month, government data showed on Thursday, dealing a blow to hopes that housing market stability was on the horizon. 

 The number of U.S. workers filing new claims for jobless benefits unexpectedly fell last week, government data on Thursday showed, but so-called continued claims rose to a fresh record as the recession bit. KEY POINTS: HOUSING STARTS: * The Commerce Department said housing starts fell 10.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 510,000 units, the second lowest on records dating back to 1959, from February's downwardly revised 572,000 units. * House starts in the West region, which has been hit hard by the housing slump, fell 26.3 percent to a record low 73,000 rate. * Analysts polled by Reuters had expected an annual rate of 540,000 units for March. * New building permits, which give a sense of future home construction, dropped 9 percent to a record low 513,000 units, from 564,000 units in February. * That was well below analysts' estimates of 550,000. * Building completions rose 3.5 percent to 824,000 units. JOBLESS CLAIMS: * Initial claims for state unemployment insurance benefits declined 53,000 to a seasonally adjusted 610,000 in the week ended April 11 from a revised 663,000 the week before, the Labor Department said. * Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast 655,000 new claims versus a previously reported count of 654,000 the week before. COMMENTS: MICHELLE MEYER, ECONOMIST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL, NEW YORK: "As expected, the sharp drop in housing starts was driven by the multi-family sector, which makes sense after the surprising pop in February. More importantly, the fall in permits was bigger than we expected. This suggests we are not at the bottom in housing starts yet and we have at least a few more months of decline." STEVE GOLDMAN, MARKET STRATEGIST, WEEDEN & CO, GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT: "The housing starts were weaker than expected, but on the other hand you are seeing JPMorgan rising and falling after the results. Right now it's up and that's helping the S&P. "The market will be focusing on JPMorgan today and everyone will be watching that sector. "The housing market has been working its way through its issues. Right now it's in a comatose stage and no one is expecting a big turnaround yet. Payrolls will start to ebb from the extremes seen last month, but that will happen very slowly. Generally the markets tend to rally ahead of the recovery in employment." MATTHEW STRAUSS, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, TORONTO: "Taken together, both releases will put a damp on the nascent optimism we've seen in the markets in the past couple of weeks. While the situation in housing and in the labor markets is not necessarily deteriorating, it's clear that there is no real sign of recovery whatsoever. The balance is tipping in favor of 'safer' assets." DAVID COARD, HEAD, FIXED-INCOME SALES, TRADING, THE WILLIAMS CAPITAL GROUP, NEW YORK: "Initial jobless claims were down much more than expected. But continued claims were over 6 million for the first time: I think that's a big deal. And we get weaker-than-expected housing starts and permits. Net, net it's probably favorable for Treasuries." MATT ESTEVE, CURRENCY TRADER, TEMPUS CONSULTING, WASHINGTON "The housing starts is a bit worse than what we expected, and that's a bit troubling. But nobody thought this recovery would be easy. Jobless claims are a little better than expected, and that's something we may start to see from here. If so, that's a good thing for the U.S. economy in the long term. But overall, everything was not far out of line with expectations, so I don't think you'll see the dollar move too much against the major currencies. People are more interested to see how the stock market does today." KURT KARL, CHIEF U.S. ECONOMIST, SWISS RE, NEW YORK: JOBLESS CLAIMS: "The weekly numbers have been falling. We want see job losses down from these huge claims numbers. I think unemployment insurance is hitting a peak because I don't think we need to lay off more works. That should help spending and income growth." HOUSING STARTS: "It's disappointing. Half a million in starts is real low. Things are hitting the floor. I think it will turnaround over the next few months." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: S&P 500 equity index futures add to gains after data. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices pare losses. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar little changed versus yen.
