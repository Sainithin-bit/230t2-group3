 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Southwest Airlines ( LUV.N ) reported a surprisingly large quarterly loss on Thursday as business and leisure travel slumped and the value of its fuel hedging program fell, sending shares down almost 9 percent. 

 The Dallas-based carrier, widely known for its thriftiness, pinned the loss on faltering passenger demand, particularly in business travel, during the "the toughest revenue environment in our history," said Chief Executive Gary Kelly in a statement. The results marked the third straight drop in quarterly net profit for Southwest after 17 years in the black. In an effort to trim costs and boost revenue, the No. 1 U.S. low-cost carrier said it planned to cut capital spending, capacity and offer employee buyouts for the third time since 2004. "In this brutal economy, I don't think we can take anything off the table," said Kelly during a conference call with analysts and reporters. "We'll have to consider all available means to restore our profitability or else we'll be bankrupt like so many other airlines have been." Shortly after the earnings call, S&P equity research analyst Jim Corridore cut his price target on the airline and earnings per share for the company, citing "likely continued declines in pricing and unit revenues." In New York Stock Exchange trade, Southwest stock shed more than 8.7 percent to $6.96, its sharpest percentage drop since January 23 when a Calyon Securities analyst downgraded the stock to "sell. RESULTS Southwest posted a loss of $91 million, or 12 cents a share, including $71 million on the falling value of its fuel hedges, for the first quarter. This compares with a year-earlier net profit of $34 million, or 5 cents per share. Excluding special items from a portion of the company's fuel-hedge portfolio, the loss came to 3 cents per share. The results missed analysts' expectations of a loss of 1 cent per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Total operating revenue slipped 6.8 percent to about $2.4 billion. Based on booking and revenue trends so far, Southwest expects another year-over-year decline in operating unit revenue, or revenue per available seat mile (RASM), in the second quarter. Kelly said during the conference call with reporters and analysts that he "wouldn't be shocked at all" to see second-quarter unit revenue fall more than the 2.9 percent drop it saw during the period ended March 31. Southwest is the second major airline to report during this earnings season after American Airlines parent AMR Corp AMR.N reported a quarterly loss of $375 million on Wednesday. The airline industry has been hit hard by the recession, and carriers have been forced to cut jobs and capacity. Southwest saw an 8.1 percent decline in traffic for the first quarter. With oil prices on the rise, Southwest said it had begun to rebuild its 2009 and 2010 hedge positions. It has derivative contracts in place for about 50 percent of its second-quarter 2009 estimated fuel consumption, capped at about $66 a barrel. CAPACITY, JOB CUTS LOOM Kelly said that the company was closely watching bookings for signs of recovery. He added that Business Select bookings may have "bottomed" in March and the company was still on track for strong load factors into the second quarter. Still, the No. 1 low-cost carrier also said it planned to cut capital spending by about $1.4 billion for 2009 and 2010 by deferring aircraft deliveries, accelerating aircraft retirements and suspending plans to expand capacity. The company said it expected its capacity to decline by about 5 percent from 2008, a sharper cut than was announced in January. The company still plans to accept 13 new Boeing 737-700s in 2009 and will retire 15 aircraft by the end of the year. Southwest also said it would offer employee buyouts to nearly all its 35,000 employees. Previously more than 1,500 employees took the buyouts, which include cash, healthcare and some flight benefits. Southwest also said it has put in place a hiring freeze and frozen pay for officers and senior management. During a conference call with analysts and reporters, Kelly said he did not see involuntary furloughs as needed, as long as the airline returned to profitability.
