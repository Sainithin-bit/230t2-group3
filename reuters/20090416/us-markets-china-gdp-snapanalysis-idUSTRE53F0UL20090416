 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - The further slowdown in Chinese economic growth at the start of 2009 is likely to prompt investors to take some chips off the table in Asia stocks after a  surge of about 35 percent to a six-month peak on Thursday. 

 Hopes for a second round of hefty stimulus spending from Beijing have added more fuel to the gains in stocks in the past few days, but analysts and traders believe that any announcement of such a plan would likely spur some profit-taking. Growth slowed to 6.1 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, marking the weakest pace on records going back to 1992 as the sharp fall-off in exports since the end of last year offset strong fixed-asset investment. The MSCI index of Asia-Pacific stocks outside Japan trimmed some gains but was still up 0.7 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng and the Shanghai Composite index both fell into negative territory. The Chinese data may serve as a spark for a retreat, with many other signals already flashing that a turn lower may be around the corner after the rapid rebound from last year's record plunge. VALUATIONS GETTING STRETCHED * Valuations are starting to look stretched in some areas after money has flowed back into equities in the past six weeks, with fund tracker EPFR saying Asia ex-Japan stock funds enjoyed their biggest inflows last week since April 2008 when markets started to settle down after the Bear Stearns collapse. * That suggests that investors may start to shy away from chasing this market run higher, especially as some technical signals are flashing that stocks are due for a near-term retreat. * The 12-month forward P/E ratio on the main MSCI APXJ has already risen back to 13.56 -- above the average of 12.7 since May 2001 after recovering from a low of 7.87 in November when the index hit a five-year low. STIMULUS IMPACT ON TECH STOCKS LARGELY FACTORED IN * Technology shares in Asia-Pacific ex-Japan have been driving the rally, making Taiwan and South Korea two of the best performing equity markets in the world outside the surge in Chinese A-shares. * On the IT index of the MSCI APXJ, the forward earnings outlook has already improved sharply, also suggesting the market may be getting ahead of itself. * The one-month change in the 18-month forward earnings outlook has already recovered to an increase of 2.49 percent as of April -- the biggest since mid-2004 -- after plunging by 24.6 percent in November, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S global estimates tracker. * The filtering of China's stimulus spending through to technology firms in Taiwan and South Korea -- especially for products like notebooks and other gadgets needing chips -- has been one factor driving Asian markets. TECHNICAL SIGNALS * From a technical perspective, the rally in stocks across the region is starting to look stretched as well, with some gauges (triple oscillator and 14-day RSI) showing the move losing momentum even as repeated highs have been reached in the past week -- causing a negative bearish divergence on the charts. * Any pull-back in stocks would make waves across markets, likely pushing short-term interest rate swap curves flatter and sparking a retreat in higher-yielding currencies, especially the Australian dollar. * Aussie/yen has a positive 93 percent daily correlation with the MSCI APXJ tech sub-index, a correlation that has strengthened during the equity rally and is even higher than main index. * The stronger correlation suggests an Asian equity drop will lead to some selling of the Australian dollar and other currencies favored as carry trades have come back in favor. * The daily correlation between the one-year/three-year Australian swap curve and the MSCI APXJ tech such-index is about 80 percent, a stark contrast from being about 90 percent negatively correlated in January and showing the widespread impact of the stock rally.
