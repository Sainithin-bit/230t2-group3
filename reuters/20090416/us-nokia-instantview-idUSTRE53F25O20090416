 STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - Top mobile phone maker Nokia reported first-quarter earnings per share just shy of market expectations on Thursday but said the demand picture was growing more predictable. 

 Nokia also said it still saw the mobile device market shrinking about 10 percent this year. Following are views from analysts on the results: MARTTI LARJO, NORDEA "The first quarter profit was lower than the estimates, but the good news is that their devices business was above consensus. They keep their guidance relatively unchanged, which is also positive." "They have lowered their guidance for the networks side, and now forecast a yearly decline of 10 percent compared to earlier forecast of minus 5 percent. So that is bad news for Ericsson." JARI HONKO, EQ BANK "Overall, the Q1 figures are fairly well in line with what consensus was modeling. In fact, Nokia's volumes are slightly ahead of consensus, but that seems to have happened at the expense of ASP -- the handset average selling price was surprisingly low at 65. This could illustrate that Nokia has been driving excess inventories down from the sales channel." CAROLINA MILANESI, GARTNER "I'm actually quite happy with it because a lot is in line with our expectations." "I think it's good that they've not changed the outlook." "Basically, the story to take away is it's still been a very challenging quarter, but at least things didn't get any worse, and I think that's a good story." MICHAEL SCHRODER, FIM "All in all I think the first quarter was a quite neutral result." "Then looking forward, I think that probably a bit disappointing was Q2 industry volume guidance of flat or slightly up." "I think that expectations were more like normal seasonality, which means 3-4 percent up." "On their margin guidance, they held the more than 10 percent for the first half intact for the devices business, which is good." "All in all, a fairly neutral to positive report." GREGER JOHANSSON, REDEYE "Overall, this is an OK report, and most importantly, the profit in their phone business is actually a bit better than expected." "Nokia's volumes were a bit better than anticipated which is a positive thing, but on the other hand, the average handset price was a bit lower than expected. But what is crucial is that they made more money than people had expected." "On the systems side it looks weak -- both in sales, margins and outlook -- which could be bad for Ericsson but historically this is hard to read across." GEOFF BLABER, CCS INSIGHT "Nokia's first-quarter results picked up where 2008 left off with sales, ASPs and margins continuing to fall year on year. Although it's another poor performance we maintain our belief that Nokia is in a stronger relative position than its competitors with greater margins and the significant advantage of scale and distribution." "Although these results paint another gloomy picture we remain confident of a stronger second half in 2009 as the channel seeks to rebuild stock after a sustained period of inventory clearance" HANNU RAUHALA, POHJOLA "The profitability of the devices is quite good. The network side was a bit disappointing but Nokia has very good basic profitability." JAMES DAWSON, MORGAN STANLEY "I think the key number is the handset margin which is above 10 percent, and that's better than expected." "And holding the guidance with kind of a reasonable tone in the outlook statement will probably be taken relatively bullishly." "It's not a slam dunk. The stock up 5 percent seems about the right outcome." RICHARD WINDSOR, NOMURA "The handset numbers are ok. The outlook has been maintained for device margins which is a net positive. We were worried about device shipments and margins, which have come in better than expected. There is weakness in infrastructure markets, which missed on both revenue and profits for the first quarter."
