 (Reuters) - American International Group Inc agreed to sell its U.S. auto insurance unit to Zurich Financial Services on Thursday, its largest asset sale since a rescue by the government in September. 

 U.S. taxpayers have taken a roughly 80 percent stake in AIG, once the world's largest insurer, in exchange for providing up to $180 billion in financial support. It is trying to sell assets to pay back the government. So far it has deals worth more than $4 billion for 12 businesses. Below are some of the major deals it has announced: PROPERTY                                    BUYER                                          PRICE 21st Century Insurance                  Zurich Financial                            $1.9 bln Unibanco AIG Seguros                 Unibanco                                       $820 mln Hartford Steam                               Munich Re                                     $739 mln AIG Life of Canada                        BMO Financial Group                  $263 mln AIG Private Bank                           Aabar Investments                        $253 mln (Reporting by  Paritosh Bansal )
