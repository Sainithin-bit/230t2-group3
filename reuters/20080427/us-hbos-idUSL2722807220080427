 LONDON  (Reuters) - British HBOS Plc's HBOS.L board will meet on Monday to discuss a possible rights issue ahead of the banking group's annual investor meeting (AGM) on Tuesday, Sunday newspapers reported. 

 A spokesman for HBOS would not comment on the reports. The Sunday Times said the board would be asked to consider raising from 2 billion pounds ($3.94 billion) to 4 billion from investors but might decide to try to ride out the credit crunch without raising additional funds. The Sunday Telegraph said HBOS, which is also scheduled to issue a trading update on Tuesday, would announce a writedown of up to 3 billion pounds. Last Monday, Britain's Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc ( RBS.L ) unveiled a record 12 billion pound rights issue to cover increased writedowns on the value of toxic assets and help repair one of the sector's most stretched balance sheets.
