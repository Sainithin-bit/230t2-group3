 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Eos Airlines, which offers business class flights between New York and London, said it has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, becoming the latest carrier to fail in the face of record fuel prices and a softening economy. 

 Eos said it would stop operations entirely on April 27, cutting most of its work force. Eos joins a number of other carriers to shut down in recent weeks, including Aloha Airlines, Champion Air, ATA Airlines, Skybus Airlines. Eos filed for bankruptcy protection on April 26 in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of New York. (Reporting by  Paul Thomasch , editing by Richard Chang)
