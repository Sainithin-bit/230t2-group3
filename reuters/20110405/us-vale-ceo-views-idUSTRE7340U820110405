 SAO PAULO  (Reuters) - Brazil's Vale ( VALE5.SA ), the world's largest iron ore producer, named late on Monday Murilo Ferreira as chief executive amid mounting concerns of state meddling in the company. 

 Ferreira, a 30-year mining industry veteran and a former employee of Vale, will succeed Roger Agnelli on May 22, according to a statement. Here are views of some analysts on the new CEO's appointment: RODRIGO BARROS, MINING ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK: "In our view, the appointment of an executive with extensive track record in the mining industry and strong knowledge of Vale's operations should be positive for the company. "We believe that the current management of Vale, under the leadership of Agnelli, has transformed Vale into a leading world class mining company and that the roadmap for Vale's growth is already in place." ALEX HACKING, MINING ANALYST, CITIGROUP: "Ferreira, together with Vale's executive management and Board of Directors, will have to balance Vale's existing investment program with any additional domestic investments preferred by the Brazilian government, such as in steel or energy." FELIPE HIRAI, ANALYST, BANK OF AMERICA MERRILL LYNCH: "The announcement is unexpected, but positive -- the clear government intervention should still have a negative impact, -- as we believe Murilo can be considered an internal candidate, bringing the least disruption to Vale, and can ease the concerns of a higher government intervention. "One key priority ... should be to rebuild relationships mainly with the government and clients. We hope the assault on Vale, as we saw over the last few weeks, eases with his nomination, given Murilo's more conciliatory profile. "It's a paradox, but Roger leaves Vale after the company reported its highest earnings in history. "We, many times in the past, criticized the company for its aggressiveness in dealing with clients, the tensions with government, the appetite for acquisitions and the huge capex. Today, we realize much of Vale's success has to be attributable to Roger. "We also believe his ultimate goal, to make the largest global miner, can still be met."
