 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's government is likely to set aside more than 3 trillion yen ($35 billion) for its first extra budget for disaster relief, the Asahi newspaper reported on Wednesday. 

 Citing a government draft of the extra budget, the newspaper also said Japan would not issue new debt to help finance the extra budget. It will instead make up for the costs by reviewing some of its spending plans pledged by the ruling Democratic Party, such as payouts to households with children, and tapping about 2.5 trillion yen from reserves in special accounts, the paper said. The first extra budget will pay for repairing infrastructure such as roads, ports and schools, as well as for steps to help those in quake-hit regions in Japan's northeast find new jobs, it said.
