 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Daimler AG's Mercedes-Benz is recalling 136,750 M-Class and M-Class AMG vehicles in the United States made from 1999 to 2004 for issues related to cruise control that may lead to a crash, U.S. federal safety regulators said. 

 A filing with the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration shows that repairs will be made at Mercedes dealerships beginning in September. Applying the brakes to disengage cruise control may fail, increasing the chances of a crash, the filing said. There are other ways, including working a "cruise control stalk" or pumping the brakes, that will still engage the system in the event that applying the brakes fails, the filing said. The recall was prompted by several complaints from consumers, NHTSA said. The recall covers model year 2000-2002 M-Class and 2000-2004 M-Class AMG vehicles.
