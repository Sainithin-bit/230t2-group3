 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner, a Republican, had a "productive" meeting with Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid to try to reach a budget deal that would keep the government running beyond a Friday deadline, an aide said. 

 "The Speaker and the Senate Majority Leader sat down privately and had a productive discussion. They agreed to continue working on a budget solution," Boehner spokesman Michael Steel said. (Reporting by  Andy Sullivan ; Editing by  Eric Beech )
