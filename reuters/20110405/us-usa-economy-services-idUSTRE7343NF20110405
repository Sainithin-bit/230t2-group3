 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. services sector growth slowed in March, according to an industry report released on Tuesday. 

 The Institute for Supply Management said its index of non-manufacturing activity fell to 57.3 last month. The index hit 59.7 in February, a five-year high. The March result was below the 59.5 median forecast of the 71 economists surveyed by Reuters. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector. (Reporting by  Steven C.
