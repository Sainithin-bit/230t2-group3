 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. Federal Reserve policy-makers last month discussed the importance of retaining the flexibility to increase or scale back their asset purchases if the economic outlook changed, the Fed said on Wednesday. 

 KEY POINTS: * "With respect to the large-scale asset purchase programs, some members thought that an increase in the maximum amount of the Committee's purchases of agency MBS (mortgage backed securities) could help to reduce economic slack more quickly than in the baseline outlook," the Fed said in minutes of its September 22-23 meeting. COMMENTS: RICHARD FRANULOVICH, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST, WESTPAC, NEW  YORK: "The minutes have a dovish tilt. The Fed was talking about adding MBS purchases. The outlook was also not as upbeat. The markets are taking this as dollar negative. It cements the view that the Fed will hold interest rates for a long time and that is bearish on the dollar."
