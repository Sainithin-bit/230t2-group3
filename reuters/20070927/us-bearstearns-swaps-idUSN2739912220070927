 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The cost of insuring the debt of Bear Stearns Cos BSC.N rose on Thursday after a CNBC cable television report rebutted a story on talks between the investment bank and potential outside investors. 

 Bear Stearns' credit default swap spreads widened 20 basis points to 88 basis points, or $88,000 per year for five years to insure $10 million in debt, said a trader. On CNBC, reporter David Faber said, "At present, Bear is not holding talks about the sale of a stake to anyone." Bear's credit default swaps rallied 17 basis points on Wednesday on a New York Times report that several investors, including Warren Buffett, might buy part of the investment bank.
