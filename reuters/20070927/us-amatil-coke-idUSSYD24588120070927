 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Australian soft drinks maker Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd ( CCL.AX ) said on Thursday the Coca-Cola Company ( KO.N ) plans to sell a stake of about 2.4 percent in Amatil to buy a stake in Amatil's former South Korean business. 

 Coca-Cola Co will sell about 18 million Amatil shares through a book build process to start on Thursday, after the market close. The U.S. firm currently has 32 percent of Amatil. At Thursday's closing price of A$9.25, the stake would be worth A$166.5 million ($146 million). Coca-Cola Amatil sold its South Korean business to LG Household & Health Care ( 051900.KS ) in July for A$520-A$545 million ($458-$480 million). LG said soon after that it hoped to sell some of the shares to Coca-Cola Co, and that it had sought Coca-Cola's participation from the initial stage of its interest in the South Korean business. Coca-Cola Co said in a statement the funds from the sale will be used to acquire a 10 percent stake in the Korean business, as well as to fund other growth opportunities in the region. "This sale merely balances our investments in the region," Coca-Cola Co said, adding it has no plans to sell any additional shares. ($1=A$1.14)
