 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Rite Aid Corp ( RAD.N ), the No. 3 U.S. drugstore chain, reported a wider-than-expected quarterly loss on Thursday, and cut its full-year outlook citing current sales trends, pushing its shares down nearly 5 percent in premarket trading. 

 Its net loss was $69.6 million, or 10 cents a share, in the second quarter, compared with a loss of $330,000, or 2 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts, on average, expected a loss of 6 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Acquisition-related costs offset an increase in sales, Rite Aid said. Rite Aid bought the U.S. Brooks and Eckerd drugstore chains from Canada's Jean Coutu Group (PJC) Inc ( PJCa.TO ) on June 4, just after the end of its fiscal first quarter. The acquisition resulted in costs including a $65.2 million increase in depreciation and amortization, and integration expenses of $52.1 million, Rite Aid said. Revenue rose nearly 54 percent to $6.6 billion. Same-store sales increased 1.1 percent in the period. For the full year, Rite Aid expects a loss of $78 million and $161 million, or 15 cents to 27 cents a share. It had previously forecast a net loss between $47 million and $129 million, or 11 cents to 23 cents a share. It expects sales in the range of $24.5 billion and $25.1 billion for the full year, down from its previous outlook of between $25.3 billion and $26 billion. Analysts expect a loss of 12 cents a share on sales of $25.4 billion. Rite Aid forecast same-store sales, excluding acquired stores, to increase between 1.3 percent and 3.3 percent. Previously, it had expected an increase of 3.8 to 5.8 percent. It expects $200 million in acquisition-related costs savings in the year, up from its earlier estimate of $155 million. In the next fiscal year, it expects the acquisition to add 12 cents to 14 cents a share to earnings. Rite Aid shares were down 4.95 percent at $4.80 in premarket trading.
