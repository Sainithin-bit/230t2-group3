 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Verizon Communications ( VZ.N ) said on Friday that a shareholder proposal seeking "say on pay" of senior executives was approved, with 50.18 percent of votes. 

 Preliminary results on May 3 had been too close to call, requiring a final tabulation by independent election inspectors. The proposal had sought the company's board of directors to adopt a policy giving shareholders an annual vote on senior executive pay packages.
