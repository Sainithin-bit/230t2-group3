 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A U.S. judge has denied a motion by BP Plc ( BP.L ) and its former Chief Executive John Browne to dismiss a shareholder suit over alleged mismanagement of the company. 

 The lawsuit claims that Browne and other executives mismanaged the company, resulting in rampant pipeline corrosion, oil spills and a partial shutdown last year at Alaska's Prudhoe Bay field. The complaint asked that Browne's retirement package be frozen, sought a refund of other executives' pay and a series of corporate governance reforms. Lawyers for Browne and other BP executives had asked Alaska Superior Court Judge Jack Smith to dismiss the lawsuit on the grounds that BP is a British company and the suit could not be pursued legally in Alaska. But Smith countered that argument in his opinion this week. "BP has availed itself of the privilege of doing business in Alaska and of the protections of Alaska's laws, making it reasonable for BP to expect to be haled into court in the state," Smith wrote in the opinion on Thursday. Daren Beaudo, a spokesman for BP said the company does not comment on ongoing litigation. The judge set a hearing for arguments on a requested preliminary injunction in the case for June 6.
