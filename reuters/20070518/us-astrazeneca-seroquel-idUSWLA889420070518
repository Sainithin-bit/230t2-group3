 LONDON  (Reuters) - Anglo-Swedish drugmaker AstraZeneca Plc ( AZN.L ) said on Friday U.S. regulators had approved Seroquel XR, a once-daily version of its blockbuster schizophrenia drug. 

 Seroquel is AstraZeneca's second-biggest drug, with global sales of $3.4 billion last year. Seroquel XR is not ground-breaking, but its approval will come as a welcome boost to AstraZeneca after the recent high-profile failures of two new drugs for stroke and heart disease, which followed earlier setbacks. The group has been on an acquisitions spree in a bid to rebuild its drugs pipeline. But last month's $15.6 billion bid for U.S. biotech group MedImmune Inc MEDI.O was poorly received and AstraZeneca's shares have lost almost a quarter in value in just over six months. The group is looking to established drugs such as Seroquel to keep the business growing while it seeks acquisitions. However, the original immediate-release formulation of Seroquel faces patent threats, with a case potentially coming to court next year in the United States. Analysts say that makes Seroquel XR key to protecting long-term sales, while at the same time the newer version should have near-term potential because of its improved ease of use. Seroquel belongs to a class of drugs called atypical antipsychotics and is the most prescribed treatment of its kind in the United States. It is also used in patients with bipolar disorder. AstraZeneca shares closed at 2,745 pence on Thursday, valuing the business at about 41 billion pounds ($81 billion).
