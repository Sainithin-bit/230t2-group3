 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Allstate Corp. ( ALL.N ) said on Friday it received a subpoena from a U.S. grand jury in southern Mississippi on how it handled claims from Hurricane Katrina in 2005 -- its second subpoena this month. 

 The subpoena is the latest inquiry by attorneys generals and federal authorities into whether insurers shortchanged residents hit by the most costly storm in history. Allstate, the largest U.S. public home insurer, said the subpoena was part of an investigation that began in 2006. It received the subpoena last week. "We are working with the U.S. attorney's office and we remain confident of our claims settlement practices," said Allstate spokesman Mike Trevino. Allstate is the third largest home insurer in Mississippi after mutually-owned State Farm and a state company. Phil Supple, a spokesman for State Farm, said his company previously received a similar subpoena from the U.S, attorney and was "willingly providing information.". U.S. Attorney Donald Burkhalter said he could not confirm or deny the existence of any investigation as a matter of policy. Hurricane Katrina hit Mississippi and other Gulf Coast states in August 2005, causing more than $38 billion of insured losses. Allstate alone reported claims amounting to $3.7 billion from the storm, one of three major hurricanes that year. Earlier in May, Allstate received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for documents on homeowner's claims from Katrina. WIND VERSUS WATER While Allstate did not comment on the substance of the subpoena, most investigations into the insurers, including a state grand jury investigation by Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood, have focused on whether property insurers tried to avoid paying for damaged homes and businesses by claiming that water and not wind had caused the destruction. Water and flood damage is covered by a federal program, while wind and other damage is generally covered by private insurers such as Allstate. State Farm has been fighting numerous private lawsuits against homeowners whose houses were swept away by the hurricane. Robert Hartwig, president of the Insurance Information Institute, an industry group, said insurers had already settled more than 98 percent of the claims in Mississippi and Louisiana, which was also hit by Katrina, and only 1 percent were in litigation. "There is no evidence of systematic claims abuse by insurers," he said.
