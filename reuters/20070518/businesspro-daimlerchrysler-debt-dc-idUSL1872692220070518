 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - DaimlerChrysler DCXGn.DE will use 
the repayment of intercompany loans to reduce its debt sharply 
once the sale of its U.S. arm Chrysler closes, Chief Financial 
Officer Bodo Uebber told a newspaper. 

  The group will also stop issuing bonds and commercial paper 
in the quarters ahead, he told Germany's Boersen-Zeitung in an 
interview published on Friday.  U.S. private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management 
CBS.UL is buying a majority stake in Chrysler and will repay 
the intercompany loans -- which stood at $36 billion at the 
start of 2007 -- when the deal closes, he said.  "Based on the favorable maturity structure for bonds, bank 
loans and commercial paper, Daimler will reduce the debt that 
is no longer needed to around 10 billion euros by September 
2007," he was quoted as saying.  "In addition, bonds that mature in the fourth quarter of 
2007 and the first quarter of 2008 will not be replaced. Then 
Daimler will have no more excess debt on its books by the 
second quarter of 2008."  Asked what this meant for debt issues, he said: "We will 
not issue bonds or commercial paper in the quarters ahead."  The company plans to change its name to Daimler AG once the 
Chrysler sale goes through. It expects to close the deal in the 
third quarter of this year.
