 MOSCOW  (Reuters) - A banker who laundered billions of dollars from Russia through the Bank of New York in the 1990s is helping Moscow in a $22.5 billion lawsuit against her former employer, a lawyer acting for Russia said on Friday. 

 On Thursday Russia's federal customs service said it was filing the suit to seek damages related to alleged money laundering in the late 1990s -- a swipe at the U.S. financial system amid growing tension between Russia and the West. The Bank of New York, the oldest bank in the United States, said on Thursday it had not seen the complaint but any such lawsuit would be "totally without merit, if not frivolous". The lawsuit follows the bank's agreement in November 2005 to pay $38 million to settle two criminal investigations, including a probe into an alleged money-laundering scheme investigators said moved billions of dollars through the bank's accounts. Prosecutors said the bank "admitted its criminal conduct" and agreed to pay $26 million to the government and $12 million to other banks that lost money. Banker Lucy Edwards and husband Peter Berlin pleaded guilty in February 2000 to being part of a conspiracy to move $7 billion through Bank of New York accounts. She is now giving information to Russia against the bank. "Ms Edwards has been truthful, cooperative and exceedingly helpful, and I say that to her credit because a lot of people under her circumstances would not be cooperative," said Steven Marks, a lawyer from Florida-based firm Podhurst Orseck who is acting for the Russian side. FIGHTING LAUNDERING The Russian-born Edwards confessed to the scam and then helped the FBI with its investigation, earning herself a softer penalty. In July last year a court sentenced both Edwards and her husband to six months home confinement and a $685,000 fine. Since then the softly spoken Edwards, who is now in her late 40s, has remodeled herself as a crime fighter and has promised to use her money laundering knowledge to hunt down launderers. "It has brought back terrible memories but nevertheless she has been cooperative for several months and we fully expect her and hope that she will continue to be so," Marks told a news conference in Moscow. Many will see the case as another barb in a bitter political battle between Russia and the West, with Moscow determined to flex its muscle on the world stage. Moscow has clashed with Washington over U.S. plans to place elements of a missile defense shield in eastern Europe and, earlier on Friday, the European Union criticized Russia over democracy at an EU-Russia summit. Marks said Russia had approached the Bank of New York to try to settle out of court but that the bank had turned down the offer. He declined to give further details. Although the case had been filed in a Moscow court, the figure of $22.5 billion had been calculated because in U.S. law the party which laundered the money is liable for the entire amount, Marks said. Another U.S. statute then says the amount can be tripled to reach the final figure. Russia's customs department estimates it lost $5 billion in tax revenues from the scheme, Marks said. "The Chairman of the Bank of New York testified in court and to the U.S. congress that the only aggrieved party was Russia and that claim is still unresolved," Marks said. He said he has been working on the case for a year. "The entire money laundering scheme could never have worked without the Bank of New York," Marks said. "Whether it was intentional or just gross misjudgment, either way the bank is responsible."
