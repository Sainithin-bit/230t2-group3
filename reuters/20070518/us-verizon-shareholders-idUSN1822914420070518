 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shareholders of Verizon Communications Inc. ( VZ.N ) have narrowly won a controversial resolution seeking more say over the pay packages of executives, including Chairman and Chief Executive Ivan Seidenberg. 

 The results of the May 3 shareholder vote were disclosed by Verizon on Friday, with a final vote count showing the "say on pay" proposal had won 50.18 percent of votes. Preliminary results on the day of the meeting had been too close to call. The resolution requests Verizon's board of directors to adopt a policy giving shareholders an annual, nonbinding vote on senior executive compensation packages. Some shareholders have complained that Seidenberg's pay package was too high considering their investment returns. His 2006 total compensation was more than $20 million, according to a regulatory filing by the No. 2 U.S. phone company. Dozens of "say on pay" resolutions have been put forward this year by shareholders at major U.S. corporations amid controversy over soaring executive compensation, although few have succeeded. The Verizon resolution was one of the few to be approved following failures at Citigroup ( C.N ), Coca-Cola Co. ( KO.N ), Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) and Bank of New York Co. ( BK.N ). Verizon, which has said the proposal would not necessarily be binding, said the board was "already committed to a continuous review of the company's executive compensation practices." "It will further consider its policies in light of the high level of shareholder interest and the active discussion taking place with respect to the advisory vote in a variety of forums, including the U.S. Congress," said spokesman Robert Varettoni. Bill Jones, president of the Association of Bell Tel Retirees, which supported the proposal, said he would seek a binding resolution if the company does not heed their request. "I feel that if we have an advisory vote in place, then the company is more likely to provide the kind of information that the investment community needs, to understand what the strategy is and how they're doing according to the objectives that they've set," Jones said. "I think that that would be a positive thing for Verizon in terms of the investment community."
