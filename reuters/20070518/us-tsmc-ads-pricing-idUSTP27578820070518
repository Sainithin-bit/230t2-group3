 TAIPEI/AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - Dutch electronics firm Philips ( PHG.AS ) ( PHG.N ) raised $2.56 billion by selling more shares in Taiwan's TSMC ( 2330.TW ) on Wall Street, part of its plan to exit the world's top contract chip maker. 

 The stake sale adds to Philips' cash pile -- it ended the first quarter with 5.9 billion euros ($7.96 billion) in cash -- and the company has said it is looking at acquisitions as well as returning cash to shareholders. Philips Electronics said on Friday it will book a non-taxable gain of about 1.22 billion euros ($1.65 billion) in its second-quarter results from the sale of shares, which represent a 4.6 percent stake in TSMC, based on Reuters calculations. Philips' shares rose 1.23 percent in early trade. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (TSMC) ( TSM.N ) sold 240 million American Depositary Shares (ADSs) on behalf of Philips at US$10.68 per share, marking a 5.29 percent premium to the firm's Thursday closing price in Taiwan. Investors cheered the result, sending TSMC's Taipei-listed shares to a two-week intraday high on Friday. The stock closed up 1.18 percent at T$68.50, outpacing a 0.05 percent fall in the main TAIEX share index  .TWII . "The pricing is better than the market had expected and that should be positive to TSMC's share price," said Alex Huang, a vice president at Taiwan's Mega International Securities. The latest share sale comes as TSMC is riding on a cyclical upturn driven by a new crop of computers and consumer products, including mobile phones, game consoles and flat-screen televisions. TSMC has shown its confidence in the recovery by forecasting an improvement in sales and profit margins in the second quarter. Smaller rival United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC) ( 2303.TW ) ( UMC.N ) echoed the upbeat outlook from TSMC. The U.S. share sale was oversubscribed, market sources said. The sale price was the same as TSMC's closing price in New York on Thursday. TSMC said in a statement that there was no over-allotment option in connection to this offering. One ADS equals five ordinary Taiwan shares. The pricing occurred after the New York markets closed on Thursday and just before markets opened for Friday trading in Taiwan. Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) is the sole global coordinator of the sale. Goldman and JPMorgan ( JPM.N ) are joint bookrunners. Upon closing, which is scheduled for May 23, Philips will still have approximately 2.1 billion TSMC shares, said Philips, which sold its first batch of TSMC shares in March, cutting its holding in TSMC to 12.8 percent from 16.2 percent. Philips is in the process of buying back a total of 4 billion euros of shares after it sold the largest chunk of its semiconductor unit in August. Separately, Philips said on Friday it had also sold its remaining stake of about 2.5 percent of U.S.-based JDS Uniphase Corp. ( JDSU.O ), resulting in a one-time financial loss of about 10 million euros in its second-quarter results. "If you take a look at its fundamentals, the stock (TSMC) is attractive for longer-term investors," said Barro Liao, a fund manager at Prudential Securities Investment Trust. Liao owns TSMC shares in his portfolios. (Additional reporting by  Niclas Mika  in Amsterdam) (US$1=T$33.3)
