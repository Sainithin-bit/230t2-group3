 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Greece's Deputy Foreign Minister Marilisa Xenogiannakopoulou has resigned in protest against tough terms included in a bailout agreement the country needs to avoid default, state television said on Friday. 
 The move by Xenogiannakopoulou, a member of the socialist party in the national unity government of technocrat Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, follows similar resignations by the socialist deputy labor minister and four far-right ministers. (Reporting by Harry Papachristou)
