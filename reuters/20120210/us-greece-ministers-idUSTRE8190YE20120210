 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Ministers from a far-right party in Greece's coalition government have offered their resignation to Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) said on Friday. 
 It is now up to Papademos to decide whether he will accept them, ANA said, without citing a source. The far-right LAOS party, which has refused to vote in favor of a bailout agreement needed to avert a messy default, has four members in Papademos' cabinet. (Reporting by Harry Papachristou)
