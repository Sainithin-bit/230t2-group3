 PARIS  (Reuters) - All Greece's political parties need to commit to the country's austerity plan so its European peers can move ahead with approving a second bailout, European Central Bank governing council member Christian Noyer said on Friday. 
 "All the political parties must enforce a restructuring plan which is reasonable, which is indispensable, and against which other countries are going to make a huge financial effort," he said on Europe 1 radio. Greece's political leaders said on Thursday they had clinched a deal on economic reforms needed to secure a second bailout, but euro zone finance ministers demanded more measures before providing the aid. Asked about prospects for the French economy, Noyer said: "We are not in a soft recession, we're in a flat (period) ... We already have signs that ...(growth) is going to take off again, or that it is about to take off." (Reporting By Nicholas Vinocur; Editing by John Stonestreet)
