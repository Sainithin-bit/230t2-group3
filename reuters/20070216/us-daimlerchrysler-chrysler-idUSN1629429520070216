 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The chief executive of DaimlerChrysler AG's DCXGn.DE Chrysler Group said he wants to use new alliances to more than double sales outside North America, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday. 


 The unit's previous goal, of doubling Chrysler sales outside North America from the current level of about 200,000 vehicles, was "not acceptable" and should be ratcheted up, the paper said, quoting from an interview with Chrysler CEO Tom LaSorda. Alliances with other auto makers could cut the costs of that expansion, the paper said, citing LaSorda. Chrysler is exploring partnerships to jointly develop vehicles, powertrains, axles and other aspects of auto making, the paper said. One possible alliance is with U.S. rival General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ), the paper said, citing people familiar with the matter. An agreement is far from certain, the paper said, and added that the sources discounted the potential that a possible GM-Chrysler alliance based on specific vehicles would develop into something deeper. Officials for Chrysler and GM could not immediately be reached.
