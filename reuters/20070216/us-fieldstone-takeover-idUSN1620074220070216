 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Credit-Based Asset Servicing and Securitization LLC, an affiliate of MGIC Investment Corp. ( MTG.N ) and Radian Group Inc. ( RDN.N ), said on Friday that it planned to buy subprime mortgage lender Fieldstone Investment Corp. FICC.O for $5.53 per share. 


 The offer by C-Bass -- totaling $259 million, according to Reuters data -- was more than twice Fieldstone's closing stock price of $2.60 per share on Thursday. The shares were up $2.44, or 93.9 percent, at $5.04 in afternoon Nasdaq trade. Fieldstone, the 23rd-largest lender to home buyers with the poorest credit, is the latest of about two dozen mortgage companies to shutter operations or be sold in fallout of the decade-long housing boom. Companies have been shattered by a rapid rise in delinquencies resulting from loose underwriting standards and stagnation in home prices, analysts said. The acquisition would give New York-based C-Bass a loan origination platform for the first time, following models of Wall Street investment banks such as Bear Stearns Cos. BSC.N and Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ), which purchased lenders to obtain loans more cheaply for collateral in bonds they sell. "We believe that Fieldstone's origination business will be stronger as a result of our affiliation," C-Bass Chief Operating Officer John Draghi said in a statement. C-Bass would acquire a portion of Fieldstone's loans for its portfolio on an ongoing basis, he said. In the first nine months of 2006, Fieldstone lost $28.3 million, compared with a year-earlier profit of $88.6 million. Like must subprime lenders, the company suffered last year from declining prices on loans it sold to bond issuers -- largely second-lien -- and increases to loan-loss reserves, amid a sharp rise in delinquencies. C-Bass is seen as among the safest issuers of bonds in the $575 billion home-equity asset-backed debt market, with its securities showing the second-best performance in the industry next to a Wells Fargo & Co. ( WFC.N ) platform, according to Credit Suisse research. Fieldstone's acquisition price is subject to a 20 cent per share reduction should the Columbia, Maryland-based company not settle litigation before the merger, C-Bass said in a statement. Fieldstone spokesman Mark Krebs declined to comment on how the companies would consolidate employees.
