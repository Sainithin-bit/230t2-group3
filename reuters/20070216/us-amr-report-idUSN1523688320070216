 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - AMR Corp. AMR.N , parent company of American Airlines, might be a buyout target of a group including Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) and British Airways BAY.L, according to the February 26 edition of BusinessWeek magazine. 


 The proposed bid is said to be between $9.8 billion, or $46 a share, and $11.1 billion, or $52 a share, Gene Marcial wrote in his "Inside Wall Street" column, quoting people familiar with the matter. It is uncertain that a bid for the company will materialize, BusinessWeek said, citing the sources. AMR declined to comment. Goldman Sachs was not immediately available for comment. A British Airways spokesman said: "We never comment on rumor or speculation". Neither Goldman nor British Airways would comment on the matter to BusinessWeek. AMR told the magazine that while it has lots of conversations, it doesn't comment until discussions result in substantial outcomes. Shares of AMR rose almost 9 percent in after hours trade to $41.45, after closing at $38.05 on Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange.
