 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. GT.N, the largest U.S. tire maker, reported a wider quarterly loss on Friday due to a nearly three-month strike that cost the company $367 million. 


 Goodyear, which expects the strike's impact to linger through the first half of 2007, also may raise its target for cost cuts in its multiyear restructuring plan announced in 2005 after making substantial progress in 2006, executives said. "We are revisiting our three-year target with a view of raising our goal and will provide more clarity as the year progresses," Chief Executive Robert Keegan told analysts. J.P. Morgan analyst Himanshu Patel said in a note that he expected a modestly negative stock reaction to the results due to, in part, a softer international pricing environment. "Unexpectedly, the company appears to be expecting a fairly substantial lingering strike impact in first half 2007 profits," Patel said. The company's shares fell by as much as 3.5 percent after the earnings report but recovered somewhat by midday, trading down 1.6 percent at $25.00 on the New York Stock Exchange. Goodyear's fourth-quarter net loss widened to $358 million, or $2.02 per share, from $51 million, or 29 cents per share, a year earlier, when Goodyear took a loss on asset sales. Excluding one-time items -- a loss of $2.07 per share from the strike, restructuring charges of $1.03 per share, and a gain of 86 cents per share related to a tax matter -- Goodyear earned 22 cents per share in the latest quarter. Revenue rose less than 1 percent to $4.98 billion. Excluding businesses sold from the year-earlier revenue, the rise was 2 percent, Akron, Ohio-based Goodyear said. For most of the quarter, about 15,000 members of the United Steelworkers union were on strike at Goodyear plants in the United States and Canada. RIVALS' OUTLOOKS Goodyear was the third of the world's largest tire makers to release financial details this week. Goodyear tire rival Michelin ( MICP.PA ), which settled its U.S. contract talks with the steelworkers union last year without a strike, said it expects a tangible increase in profit in 2007. Japan's Bridgestone Corp. ( 5108.T ) said it likely would beat its operating profit forecast for 2006 by 15 percent due to higher sales of volumes and a more profitable tire line-up. Goodyear's labor pact that sent employees back to work beginning January 2 allows it to close a Texas plant and establishes a company-financed trust fund for union retiree health care. Sales in North America, Goodyear's key market, fell 9.1 percent to $2.08 billion due to the strike and its decision last year to eliminate some private-label tire business. Revenue in its European Union tire unit rose 14.9 percent to $1.34 billion due to increased sales of winter tires and commercial truck tires. Sales and operating income rose in its other tire-producing units, Goodyear said. Price increases and more sales of expensive, higher-profit tires boosted revenue by $210 million. That substantially offset an increase in raw materials costs of $220 million, Goodyear said. Raw materials costs rose by 17 percent overall in 2006, and are expected to be about flat in 2007, Goodyear said. Natural rubber, synthetic rubber, carbon black, fabrics, steel cord and other materials make up about 35 percent of tire costs. The tire maker is in the midst of a restructuring that includes job and production cuts in North America to compete with cheaper imported tires. It plans to expand overseas production and materials procurement and sell some assets. Goodyear had previously raised its cost-cutting goal to more than $1 billion for the 2006 to 2008 period, from an original target range of $750 million to $1 billion, and believes it can cut more. The company expects to save about $300 million per year from its new union contract that it sees as having little overlap with the restructuring plans. Goodyear said the strike did not dampen strong buyer interest in its engineered products unit and it expects to announce a definitive sale agreement in the first half of 2007. Continental AG ( CONG.DE ) has expressed strong interest in acquiring Goodyear's engineered products business. Through Thursday, Goodyear shares had risen 21 percent since the start of 2007, when employees began returning to work, compared with an 11.5 percent rise in the Dow Jones U.S. automobiles and parts index .DJUSAP.
