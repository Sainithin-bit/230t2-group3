 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s ( WMT.N ) Japanese subsidiary, Seiyu Ltd. 8268.T, on Friday forecast a return to profit this year as its core supermarket operations started to show recovery and it continues its reform efforts. 


 Shares of Seiyu, which is owned 53 percent by the world's largest retailer, rose nearly 4 percent after the announcement, compared to a slight decline in the broad TOPIX index. Seiyu has struggled despite total investments of more than $1 billion by Wal-Mart, hurt by intense competition from rival supermarkets and other retailers in a mature market. Same-store sales showed their first annual rise in 15 years in 2006 but still failed to meet the company's target. "It was a year where we saw significant change," Seiyu Chief Executive Ed Kolodzieski told a news conference. "Unfortunately, we fell short of both our sales target and our profit target for the year." After Wal-Mart quit the South Korean and German markets last year, many market players speculated that it might leave Japan too because of Seiyu's poor performance. But the U.S. retailer has been saying it is committed to the world's second-largest retail market. Seiyu said its group net profit will likely be 800 million yen ($6.70 million) for the year to December, against a 55.8 billion yen loss in 2006. It was the fifth straight year of losses. The 2007 target compares with a consensus loss projection of 950 million yen by four analysts by Reuters Estimates. Operating profit is expected be 10.6 billion yen in 2007, against a 3.2 billion yen profit last year, while sales are seen rising 3.3 percent to 992.1 billion yen. Seiyu's 2006 results were well flagged because the company said in January it would fall deeper into the red than it first estimated. Seiyu has been trying to improve store operations and its distribution systems using Wal-Mart's expertise, but the company has never posted a net profit since the U.S. retailer took a small stake in it in 2002. The Japanese company said it would continue with its reform efforts, including store remodeling and an improvement of its private brands. So far, Seiyu has refurbished nearly 100 of its some 390 stores across Japan in an attempt to lure Japan's notoriously fickle shoppers. The company has added in-store bakeries in some locations and has begun to emphasize products outside of its traditional line-up, including electronics. Seiyu mainly operates superstores through its group network of some 390 outlets but unlike other Japanese retailers such as Aeon Co. ( 8267.T ) it does not have finance or speciality store units to offset sluggish core operations. Shares in Seiyu plunged nearly 59 percent last year, underperforming a 21 percent fall in the Tokyo Stock Exchange's retailer sub index .IRETL.T.
