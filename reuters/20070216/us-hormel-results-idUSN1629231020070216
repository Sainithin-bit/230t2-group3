 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Hormel Foods Corp. ( HRL.N ) reported higher quarterly profit on Friday as price increases and sales of refrigerated items liked sliced pepperoni helped offset higher grain costs, but the results just missed the analysts' average estimate. 


 The company, whose shares fell 1.5 percent, said its grocery business had generated lower-than-expected sales and profits, and the higher price of grain, which is used in animal feed, weighed on its Jennie-O Turkey business. The maker of Spam luncheon meat and Dinty Moore canned stew reported net income of $75.3 million, or 54 cents per share, for the first quarter ended on January 28, compared with $69.3 million, or 50 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had forecast 55 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 6 percent to $1.5 billion. Chief Executive Jeffrey Ettinger said in a statement that higher grain prices would probably continue to pressure the turkey business, which represents less than a quarter of Hormel's operating profit. He added the company would try to find ways to offset the higher costs, including by raising prices. However, an analyst said turkey pricing and margins would be down. "There's not much you can do with turkey pricing to offset higher grain prices," said Timothy Ramey of D.A. Davidson & Co. The price of corn -- a key turkey feed -- has gone up because of demand from ethanol manufacturers. "It's going to be a down year for turkey," Ramey said. Grocery products, Hormel's second most-profitable business behind refrigerated foods, reported a 1 percent increase in net sales and operating profit. "Their grocery business was a bit lighter than we expected," said Ramey. "There wasn't enough topline growth, which they want to address with marketing." Plans for 2007 include stepped-up promotions and marketing of grocery products. The company's refrigerated and specialty foods businesses posted strong results for the quarter. For the year, the company stood by its earnings outlook of $2.15 to $2.25 a share. Analysts on average have forecast  $2.20. Hormel also said it expected second-quarter profit of 47 to 53 cents a share. Analysts have forecast 51 cents. The company's shares were down 59 cents at $38.54 in morning New York Stock Exchange trade.
