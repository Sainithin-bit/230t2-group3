 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Dell Inc. DELL.O said on Friday it hired the head of Motorola Inc.'s MOT.N mobile phone unit, making him the second high-profile executive Michael Dell has hired since he reclaimed the CEO title at the end of last month. 


 Ron Garriques, who headed Motorola's most important division, will become president of Dell's global consumer division, effective February 19. Dell, ranked second in the personal computer market after losing the top spot to Hewlett-Packard Co. ( HPQ.N ) last year, is trying to reverse slowing sales and thinning profit margins. Garriques will be in charge of consumer product design. "It's a very good hire and a first step in Dell trying to rebuild its consumer franchise," said Brent Bracelin, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, who has a "sector perform" rating on Dell shares and does not own any. "Dell has historically not been a consumer company, but if you look at the growth opportunities, a major portion of the growth in the computer business will come from the consumer side of the house," Bracelin said. At Motorola, Garriques was head of the handset maker's most important division. He was not directly responsible for developing the popular Razr, which sparked the craze for ultra-thin phones, but is credited with other handsets. "He was the architect of the new models that brought them back from the brink from 2000," said Edward Snyder, an analyst at Charter Equity Research. Garriques is the second senior executive hired by Dell this week, following Solectron Corp. SLR.N Chief Executive Michael Cannon, who was appointed as head of global operations. Michael Dell, who took the CEO title from Kevin Rollins in January, said Garriques' responsibilities would include boosting sales in consumer markets outside the United States. "As the number of people online doubles from one to two billion over the next several years, the majority of new consumers will be located in fast-growing and emerging markets," the chief executive said. Dell, since its founding in 1984, has sold directly to buyers via telephone or the Internet, bypassing retailers. Consumer sales account for about 15 percent of total sales. Analysts say the company needs to consider selling products in stores to compete with HP and Apple Inc. ( AAPL.O ). "That is a huge, huge problem right now, especially as you try to sell up-market" with high-end computers and wide-screen televisions that Dell introduced recently, said J.P. Gownder, an analyst at Forrester Research. "If people don't see them, why would they want to buy them?" IMPACT ON MOTOROLA Garriques' resignation from Motorola is effective immediately and comes as the No.2 maker of mobile phones grapples with falling profit margins due to disappointing demand for its more expensive handsets and competition in emerging markets for cheaper phones. Motorola said Garriques will be replaced on an interim basis by Ray Roman, senior vice president of global sales, and Terry Vega, senior vice president of global devices. "His departure, and it seems clear he chose to leave, is a bit disturbing ... he's decided he's giving up on the future there," said Snyder. But another analyst, Prudential Equity's Inder Singh, said Garriques' departure may present an opportunity to shake up Motorola. The company is cutting 3,500 jobs after steep discounts on mobile phones contributed to a 48 percent drop in fourth quarter profit. "Motorola's been looking for an upgrade of its handset product business, so I'm not sure his departure is negative," Singh said. "Rather, a change of management could help stimulate its handset development." Dell shares closed up 1 cent at $24.39 on the Nasdaq. Motorola's stock closed up 2 cents at $19.26 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Additional reporting by  Ritsuko Ando  in New York)
