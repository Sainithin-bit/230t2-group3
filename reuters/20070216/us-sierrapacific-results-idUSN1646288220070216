 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Nevada utility holding company Sierra Pacific Resources Corp. SRP.N on Friday reported higher quarterly earnings, helped by continued growth in its customer base. 


 The Las Vegas-based company said net income increased to $26.1 million, or 12 cents a share, from $21.7 million, or 11 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 3.3 percent to $745 million. The Nevada Power unit posted a loss of $11.7 million, compared with a year-earlier profit of $29.3 million, hurt by higher operations and maintenance expenses and less favorable weather conditions. At the Sierra Pacific Power unit, profit rose to $15.4 million from $12.2 million, mainly due to higher construction allowances.
