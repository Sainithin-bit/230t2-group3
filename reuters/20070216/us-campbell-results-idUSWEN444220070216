 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Campbell Soup Co. ( CPB.N ) posted better-than-expected quarterly profit on Friday and raised its full year outlook, sending its shares to a seven-year high, even as U.S. soup sales fell. 


 Better-than-expected sales in the company's Pepperidge Farm baked goods business helped offset the decline in U.S. soup, which was hurt by unseasonably warm weather during much of the quarter. Pepperidge Farm was helped by double-digit sales growth of Goldfish crackers. Campbell said profit rose to $285 million, or 72 cents a share, in the fiscal second quarter ended January 28, from $254 million, or 61 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding the gain on the sale of a Pepperidge Farm facility, earnings were 68 cents a share. Analysts, on average, forecast earnings of 63 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Gross margin rose to 42.9 percent from 42.1 percent, as pricing and productivity gain exceeded cost increases, the company said. "Our philosophy is that a combination of pricing and productivity needs to be sufficient to offset our cost increases," Douglas Conant, president and chief executive, said in an interview. PRICE BOOSTS AID FOOD EARNINGS Other food companies also posted higher profit on Friday, aided in part by price increases. Food companies in general have been able to pass on higher costs to consumers in the past year or more, but have had more trouble realizing increases on top of their costs inflation. Peanut butter and jelly maker J.M. Smucker Co. ( SJM.N ) said profit in its fiscal third quarter increased 29 percent, helped by higher prices, market-share gains for most of its brands and a lower tax rate. Earnings per share of 72 cents a share, excluding charges, beat analysts' estimates. Meanwhile, Spam and Jennie-O Turkey company Hormel Foods Corp. ( HRL.N ) posted an 8.7 percent increase in profit in its fiscal first quarter, though earnings per share of 54 cents were a penny below analyst estimates. Camden, New Jersey-based Campbell also reduced advertising and promotional spending, which could raise concern with analysts. The company said it is spending advertising dollars in more efficient ways, including shifting from national television advertising to radio, magazine and Internet advertising. "I think some of the strength in operating profit is linked to lower marketing and advertising, so the quality of earnings is not that great," Arun Daniel, senior sector analyst, consumer discretionary and staples, at ING Investment Management, said. "But I think the fact that they raised the '07 outlook is positive." ING Investment Management owns about 800,000 Campbell shares. Like many food companies, Campbell has raised prices to try to overcome rising costs, while also spending money to develop new products like low-sodium soups. Sales rose 4.2 percent to $2.25 billion, though U.S. soup sales fell 1 percent. The second quarter is typically the largest sales quarter for the company as colder weather spurs soup consumption. WARM WEATHER HURTS The company said retailers built up less soup inventory in the quarter than a year ago, likely due to the warmer weather. A spokesman said the company expects a correction in the third quarter, with retailers reducing inventory less than they did a year ago. Sales in the baking and snacks business, which includes Pepperidge Farm, rose 6 percent, the company said, helped by sales of Goldfish crackers in 100-calorie, single-serve packs. Campbell said it now expects earnings from continuing operations to rise 10 percent to 12 percent in fiscal year 2007 from adjusted pro forma results of $1.73 in 2006. That is an increase from the company's forecast of a 5 percent to 7 percent increase. Campbell shares were up $2.37 at $41.95 Friday on the New York Stock Exchange and traded as high as $42.40 earlier in the day. Before Friday, Campbell shares traded at about 19 times estimated 2008 earnings, compared with a multiple of 16.9 for Progresso soup maker General Mills Inc. ( GIS.N ).
