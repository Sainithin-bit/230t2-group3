 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp. ( BAC.N ) on Friday said it awarded Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis $11.07 million of restricted stock as part of his compensation for 2006, when the No. 2 U.S. bank's profit rose 28 percent to a record. 


 According to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Lewis was awarded 205,493 restricted shares on Thursday, when the bank's shares closed at $53.85. Bank of America also awarded Lewis 400,000 stock options with a $53.85 exercise price, the filing shows. Both the restricted stock and the options vest after three years. The restricted stock award is 5 percent less than the $11.7 million that Lewis was awarded the previous year, when his overall compensation was $22 million. Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America will disclose Lewis' total compensation for 2006 later this year. Bank of America last month said 2006 profit totaled $21.13 billion, or $4.59 per share, helped by capital markets and investment banking, investment gains and a 148 percent jump in card income following the $34.2 billion purchase of MBNA Corp. The bank's shares rose 16 percent in 2006, topping the 13 percent increase in the Philadelphia KBW Bank Index .BKX. In January, Citigroup Inc. ( C.N ), the largest U.S. bank, awarded Chief Executive Charles Prince $10.69 million of restricted stock for 2006. JPMorgan Chase & Co. ( JPM.N ), the No. 3 bank, awarded Chief Executive Jamie Dimon $13 million. Bank of America shares closed Friday up 20 cents at $54.05 on the New York Stock Exchange.
