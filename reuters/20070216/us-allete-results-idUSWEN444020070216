 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Utility operator and real estate company Allete Inc. ( ALE.N ) on Friday posted higher 2006 full-year earnings compared with the previous year, when charges from a power purchase agreement weighed. 


 Net income for the year rose to $76.4 million, or $2.74 per share, from $13.3 million, or 48 cents per share, the Duluth, Minnesota-based company said.
