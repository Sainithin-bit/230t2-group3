 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - DaimlerChrysler AG's DCXGn.DE Chrysler Group and General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) are in talks on a joint project that would provide Chrysler with a version of the big Chevrolet Tahoe sport utility, the New York Times said on Friday, citing people with direct knowledge of the talks. 


 The paper said there was no indication of when the two companies might reach a conclusion in the talks, which it said have been under way for about six months, according to the same sources. The Wall Street Journal also reported on Friday that an alliance between the two Detroit carmakers was possible, citing people familiar with the matter. An agreement is far from certain, the Journal said, and added that the sources discounted the potential that a possible GM-Chrysler alliance based on specific vehicles would develop into something deeper. The Journal also reported that Chrysler's chief executive said he wanted to use new alliances to more than double sales outside North America. The unit's previous goal, of doubling Chrysler sales outside North America from the current level of about 200,000 vehicles, was "not acceptable" and should be ratcheted up, the paper said, quoting from an interview with Chrysler CEO Tom LaSorda. Alliances with other auto makers could cut the costs of that expansion, the paper said, citing LaSorda. Chrysler is exploring partnerships to jointly develop vehicles, powertrains, axles and other aspects of auto making, the paper said. Officials for Chrysler and GM could not immediately be reached.
