 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Fidelity Investments, the world's biggest mutual fund company, posted on Friday an 11.3 percent drop in net income, its first profit decline in four years, as it spent more to compete with rivals. 


 Privately held Fidelity, which has steadily lost ground to competitors such as American Funds and Vanguard Group in recent years, said net income fell to $1.18 billion in 2006 from $1.33 billion in 2005 despite a 16 percent rise in revenue to a record $12.87 billion from $11.12 billion. The Boston-based company said it used some of its earnings last year to hire new staff, upgrade technology and reimburse its funds with more than $42 million after an internal probe of improper gifts to its traders. Assets under management reached a record $1.4 trillion, up 15 percent from 2005, the firm said in its annual report. In the lucrative areas of stock and bond sales, Fidelity lagged its rivals. According to fund flow research group Financial Research Corp., American Funds' stock and bond funds took in $74 billion in new money in 2006, Vanguard Group took in $41.4 billion and Fidelity added just $17 billion. "There's no question that Fidelity has lost ground and I think it's fair to say that especially on the domestic equity side the edge that Fidelity used to have over the rest of the mutual fund industry has dried up," said Dan Lefkovitz, analyst at research firm Morningstar. To improve performance, Fidelity has in the past two years hired experienced analysts from outside and doubled their number to about 180. "Fidelity has acknowledged that the big, old way of doing things no longer worked as well and that it could learn from competitors. You are now seeing Fidelity trying to right the ship," said Morningstar's Lefkovitz. Fidelity said its fund performance slipped last year. Its funds beat just 58 percent of their peers on an asset-weighted basis in 2006, down from 70 percent in 2005. Over the last three years, the percentage of competitors beaten fell to 64 percent from 66 percent; over the last five years, the number fell to 67 percent from 68 percent. In equity funds, Fidelity last year beat just 47 percent of its peers rated by Morningstar, compared with 65 percent in 2005, Fidelity said. "Growth stocks, in which many Fidelity funds had a large exposure, performed poorly," Fidelity Chairman Edward Johnson said in the report. "This pulled down several funds, including Contrafund and Magellan, our two largest domestic equity portfolios." Fidelity's brokerage business, the biggest in the industry by total client assets, saw assets under administration rise 21 percent to a record $1.7 trillion at the end of 2006. But net new client assets fell to $164 billion last year from $194.5 billion in 2005, the firm said. (Additional reporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss)
