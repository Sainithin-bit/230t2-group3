 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Auto parts maker Visteon Corp. ( VC.N ) 
posted a quarterly net loss on Friday, hurt by vehicle 
production cuts in North America by former parent and largest 
customer Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ). 


  Visteon reported a net loss of $39 million, or 30 cents per 
share, for the fourth quarter, compared with net income of $1.3 
billion, or $10.25 per share, a year earlier, when it recorded 
a gain from the sale of facilities to Ford.  The net loss includes reimbursable restructuring expenses 
and other costs of $71 million and a net tax benefit of $32 
million.  Analysts had expected, on average, a loss of 81 cents per 
share, according to Reuters Estimates.  Revenue was little changed at $2.84 billion, and product 
sales were also flat at $2.71 billion as favorable currency 
exchange rates and increased sales in Asia were offset by lower 
production volumes, principally in North America, Visteon said.  The Van Buren Township, Michigan-based company said product 
sales to non-Ford customers rose 13 percent to $1.62 billion 
and represented 60 percent of total product sales.  Cash from operating activities for the fourth quarter was 
$239 million, an increase of $197 million over the same period 
a year earlier.  Visteon said in January it expected 2007 to be challenging 
due to production cuts by Ford on some key vehicles for which 
it supplies parts in North America and Europe. Operational and 
financial results are expected to improve in 2008.  Ford, which spun Visteon off in 2000, bought back 
money-losing business and high-wage workers from Visteon in 
2005 and agreed to help finance further restructuring.  In January, Visteon said that it expects product sales of 
about $11.1 billion in 2007. Visteon also said it expects 2007 
results to range from break-even to a loss of $100 million, 
before net interest expense, income taxes and extraordinary 
items, and excluding unreimbursed restructuring costs and 
impairment of long-lived assets.  The company expects free cash flow to be negative in 2007 
and 2008 before turning positive in 2009.
