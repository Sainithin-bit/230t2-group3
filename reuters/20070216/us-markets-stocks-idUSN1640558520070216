 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Dow Jones industrial average posted its best week since November on Friday, helped by optimism about merger activity and reassuring comments about inflation from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke. 


 News on Friday that General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) was in preliminary talks to buy Chrysler followed a flurry of takeover talk this week, including a report that American brewer Anheuser-Busch ( BUD.N ) could be in talks with Belgium's InBev INTB.BR. Bernanke, in testimony this week before Congress, said that inflation is poised to ease while the U.S. economy grows moderately. Traders said his comments increased hopes that the Fed may cut rates later in the year. For the day, the Dow eked out its third consecutive record close, ending just 2 points higher. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq were also nearly flat, with the Presidents Day holiday on Monday and expiration of February options contributing to choppy sideways trading, traders said. "I don't think (Bernanke) talked about inflation quite as much, so that gives us (investors) the feeling we are close to the comfort level of the Fed. And we came away thinking the Fed will not need to do anything for a period of time," said Richard Sichel, chief investment officer of the Philadelphia Trust Co. in Philadelphia. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  rose 2.56 points, or 0.02 percent, to end at 12,767.57, a record. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  declined 1.27 points, or 0.09 percent, to finish at 1,455.54. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  inched down just 0.79 of a point, or 0.03 percent, to close at 2,496.31. For the week, the Dow rose 1.5 percent, the S&P 500 gained 1.2 percent and the Nasdaq advanced 1.5 percent. It was the Dow's best week since November 19. MICROSOFT FALLS A drop in the shares of Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT.O ) kept stocks in negative territory for most of the day, as the software maker cast doubts about sales prospects of its much hyped new Vista computer operating system. After Thursday's closing bell, Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said that analysts' revenue forecasts for Vista were "overly aggressive." The comments come two weeks after Microsoft released the upgrade to its Windows operating system. Shares of Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, slid 2.4 percent, or 72 cents, to $28.74, their biggest drop in nine months. Microsoft was the most heavily traded Nasdaq stock. Microsoft, which also is among the 30 stocks in the Dow and a component of the S&P 500, was the biggest negative influence on those indexes, as well as on the Nasdaq 100
.NDX. TURN UP THAT MOTOWN SOUND The GM talks were first reported by the trade journal Automotive News. GM and Chrysler parent DaimlerChrysler AG DCXGn.DE DCX.N declined to comment on the report. Shares of GM were down 0.3 percent, or 10 cents, at $36.34, while DaimlerChrysler's U.S.-listed shares were up 4.4 percent, or $3.08, at $73.33 on the New York Stock Exchange. Concerns sparked by a plunge in U.S. housing starts and a dip in a gauge of consumer sentiment added to the day's early negative tone. The pace of U.S. home construction fell in January, with the figures for housing starts showing the sharpest drop since October -- much weaker than economists had expected. The slide in housing starts gave investors a reason to sell shares of home builders, including KB Home ( KBH.N ), which pushed the Dow Jones U.S. Home Construction index .DJUSHB down 0.6 percent. Shares of KB Home fell 1 percent, or 53 cents, to $54.22. In addition, U.S. consumer sentiment slipped unexpectedly in February as concerns over unemployment and inflation sapped confidence, according to the Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers. On the NYSE, about 1.36 billion shares changed hands, substantially below last year's estimated daily average volume of 1.84 billion. On the Nasdaq, about 1.95 billion shares traded, below last year's daily average of 2.02 billion. Decliners narrowly edged ahead of advancers on the NYSE, with 1,676 shares falling and 1,657 issues rising. On the Nasdaq, the breadth was positive, with about 9 stocks rising for every seven that fell. (Additional reporting by  Chris Sanders )
