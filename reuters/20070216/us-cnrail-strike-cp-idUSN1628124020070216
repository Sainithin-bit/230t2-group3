 VANCOUVER, British Columbia  (Reuters) - Canadian Pacific Railway ( CP.TO ) declared a force majeure on shipments to some terminals at the Pacific port of Vancouver because of the Canadian National Railway Co. ( CNR.TO ) strike, officials said on Friday. 


 Canadian Pacific said the facilities were on the north shore of Vancouver's Burrard Inlet where Canadian National handles train switching operations under a co-production agreement between the two railways. The strike by Canadian National's conductors and switch yard employees that began on February 10 has meant their work was now being done by management personnel, and a CN spokesman said additional people have now been assigned to the area to deal with delays. A Canadian Pacific spokesman said the strike was also slowing interchange traffic between Canada's largest railways at some other points in the country, but that overall it was not yet causing major problems for CP's operations "It's something that we are watching very closely, as you can appreciate," said CP spokesman Ed Greenberg. The problems with shipments to and from the north shore of Vancouver's Burrard Inlet were beyond CP Rail's control, it said in a memo sent to shippers declaring force majeure on contracts starting on February 14. "Interchange traffic and co-production with CN on the north shore is not moving smoothly and has been experiencing congestion related to events beyond CPR's reasonable control, including the strike by conductors employed by the CN," the memo said. The terminals at Vancouver's north shore handle grain, chemicals, wood products and fertilizers. Owners include the Canadian division of Dow Chemical Co. ( DOW.N ) as well as Saskatchewan Wheat Pool SWP.TO, Canada's No. 2 grain shipper. CP did not identify what products were affected. Greenberg said Canadian Pacific has not been trying to take advantage of its larger rival's woes by soliciting traffic because of the strike. "Our focus has been on serving our existing customers," he said. The strike has not disrupted other areas of the railways's track networks where CN and CP have co-production agreements, such as through British Columbia's Fraser Canyon where they sue each other's main line tracks, Greenberg said.
