 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Network equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc. said it agreed to give Apple Inc. more time to respond to the lawsuit it filed over the "iPhone" trademark, extending negotiations until February 21. 


 Cisco, who made the announcement late on Thursday, sued Apple for trademark infringement in January after Apple unveiled its long-awaited multimedia phone called the iPhone, a name claimed by the network equipment maker. "Cisco has agreed to give Apple an extension until Wednesday, February 21," Cisco said in a statement. "Cisco is fully committed to using the extra time to reach a mutually beneficial resolution." Cisco obtained the iPhone trademark in 2000 after acquiring a company called Infogear, which had previously owned the trademark and had sold devices called iPhones for several years. Linksys, a division of Cisco, has been selling wireless products with the iPhone name since early last year, with new products added to the line in December. It was the second agreement to an extension after a similar move on January 31. While Cisco has said it wants to keep Apple from "infringing upon and deliberately copying and using" the trademark, it has also called for "interoperability", suggesting it was seeking more than a one-off payment for use of the name. Apple spokeswoman Natalie Kerris confirmed the extension, saying the discussions were aimed at reaching an agreement on trademark rights and interoperability.
