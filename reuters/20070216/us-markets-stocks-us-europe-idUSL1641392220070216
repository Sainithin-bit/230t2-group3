 LONDON  (Reuters) - U.S. shares are set to open lower on Friday before the Presidents Day long weekend as investors focus on economic data, options expiries and bid target Compass Bancshares CBSS.O, with little of note on corporate earnings. 


 At 1113 GMT, futures for all the major U.S. stock exchanges were slightly weaker, with the Nasdaq NDc1 down 0.22 percent, the S&P SPc1 0.15 percent lower and the Dow DJc1 off 0.11 percent. Compass Bancshares Inc will be closely watched on the Nasdaq after Spain's number two bank BBVA ( BBVA.MC ) made a $9.6 billion bid on Friday, offering shareholders a premium of about 16 percent over the U.S. bank's average share price in the last 10 days. Compass shares already jumped 7.4 percent on Thursday. U.S. stocks rallied for a third straight session on Thursday, pushing the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  to yet another record, even though the flow of economic data mostly painted a weaker economic picture. The end of Friday will bring the monthly expiration of equity options, which has the potential to stir things up before U.S. markets close on Monday for Presidents Day. "If it was not an expiration day, I do not think there would really be that much going on," a trader said. Also of potential importance will be the Labour Department's release of the January producer price index (PPI). "If the PPI data is dramatically away from expectations, then I am sure it will move," a trader said. Other economic indicators due on Friday are the Commerce Department's housing starts and permits for January and the Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary consumer sentiment index for February. On a thin corporate earnings calendar, the highlights are likely to be quarterly results from Campbell Soup Co. ( CPB.N ) and Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. GT.N.
