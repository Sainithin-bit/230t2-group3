 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Greece welcomed on Friday the approval of a sixth aid tranche by euro zone finance ministers, without which the country faced a default. 
 "Today's decision by the Eurogroup for the Greek program and the sixth tranche is a positive step...which secures 2012 fiscal targets and sets the ground for the necessary structural changes," Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said in a statement. The Eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers has approved the payment of the next tranche of 8 billion euros ($11 billion) under Greece's EU/IMF bailout program -- pending approval from the International Monetary Fund, the ministers said in a statement on Friday.
