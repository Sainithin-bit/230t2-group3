 SEOUL  (Reuters) - POSCO ( 005490.KS ), the world's third-biggest steelmaker and backed by billionaire investor Warren Buffett, posted a 5.9 percent rise in profit for the third quarter, meeting consensus, thanks to higher sales volume and prices. 
 The South Korean company, which trails ArcelorMittal ( ISPA.AS ) and Baosteel ( 600019.SS ), said on Friday its July-September operating profit was 1.09 trillion won ($951.8 million), compared with an average 1.15 trillion won forecast from analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The profit compared with 1.03 trillion won a year ago, but was down from 1.5 trillion won in the previous quarter because of higher raw materials costs, POSCO said. Shares in POSCO, in which Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway ( BRKa.N ) ( BRKb.N ) owns an around 5 percent stake, have fallen 26 percent this year, compared with a 10 percent drop in the broader market  .KS11 .
