 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The White House said on Monday that President Barack Obama would designate Securities and Exchange Commission member Elisse Walter to serve as chairman when the current head of the agency, Mary Schapiro, departs next month. 
 Walter would be serving as chairman-designate on a temporary basis. A White House official said Obama planned to nominate someone in the near future to serve a full term as chairman. (Reporting by  Mark Felsenthal ; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
