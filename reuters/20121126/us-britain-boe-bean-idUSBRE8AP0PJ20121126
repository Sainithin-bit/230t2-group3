 LONDON  (Reuters) - Bank of England Deputy Governor Charlie Bean will serve for an extra year, British finance minister George Osborne told parliament on Monday. 
 Osborne announced the move after saying Canadian central bank chief Mark Carney will take over the reins as Governor of the Bank of England next year, a surprise choice to replace outgoing BoE Governor Mervyn King. (Editing by Ruth Pitchford)
