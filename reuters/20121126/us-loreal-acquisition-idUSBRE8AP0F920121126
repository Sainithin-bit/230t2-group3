 PARIS  (Reuters) - French cosmetics maker L'Oreal ( OREP.PA ) acquired U.S. make-up brand Urban Decay from private equity firm Castanea Partners as part of an effort to reach more upscale young consumers. 
 L'Oreal did not say how much it paid for California-based Urban Decay, which was created in 1996 by make-up expert Wende Zomnir and had sales of $130 million in its fiscal year ended June 2012. Liberum Capital analyst Pablo Zuanic welcomed the deal, which he pegged at about $250-300 million or slightly more than 2 times sales. Urban Decay is "exactly the type of brand L'Oreal needs to beef up its make-up portfolio in the prestige channel," he said in a note. The market for specialist make-up brands represents 44 percent of the luxury cosmetics market in the United States. (Reporting by Dominique Vidalon; Editing by Helen Massy-Beresford)
