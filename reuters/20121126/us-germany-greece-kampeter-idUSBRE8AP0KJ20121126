 BERLIN  (Reuters) - Germany's deputy finance minister said he expected Greece's international creditors to strike a deal later on Monday on unfreezing loans for the heavily indebted country. 
 Euro zone finance ministers and the International Monetary Fund are holding a third round of talks in as many weeks to disburse the next tranche of aid to Greece required to avert national bankruptcy. "I see a very good chance for a deal tonight," Deputy Finance Minister Steffen Kampeter told a conference. He reiterated Germany's opposition to writing off some of the Greek debt held by euro zone governments - a proposal backed by the IMF - adding that Berlin was not isolated in its stance.
