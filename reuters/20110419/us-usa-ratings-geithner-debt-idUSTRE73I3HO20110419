 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said on Tuesday there is no risk the United States could lose its top-tier AAA credit rating as politicians move closer to agreeing on how to slashing the massive U.S. debt. 

 "No risk of that," he said in an interview with Fox Business Network. "If you listen carefully now, you see the leadership of the United States of America ... recognizing now this is the right thing to do for the economy." Geithner said there is growing bipartisan political consensus behind bringing down long-term deficits and strengthening growth. "It's hard for people to look past the political rhetoric," he said. "I think the prospects for bipartisan agreement are better than they've been in a long period of time. Of course, we have to turn that into action."
