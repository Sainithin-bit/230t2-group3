 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ.N ) reported stronger than expected quarterly earnings, as rebounding prescription drug sales overshadowed declines in sales of over-the-counter medicines that have been plagued by recalls. 

 Shares of the diversified healthcare company rose 3.2 percent as it also lifted its 2011 profit view, citing foreign exchange factors that had also helped first-quarter results. "It was a good quarter, and it was really the pharmaceuticals division that led the way," said Gabelli & Co analyst Jeff Jonas. "And the division has a bright future because it has a strong pipeline" of experimental medicines. The company said on Tuesday it earned $3.48 billion, or $1.25 per share, compared with $4.53 billion, or $1.62 per share, a year ago, when J&J had substantial tax gains. Excluding special items, including litigation expenses and the cost of recalling hip replacement products, J&J earned $1.35 per share. That topped the average forecast of $1.26 per share among analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Quarterly revenue rose 3.5 percent to $16.17 billion, above Wall Street expectations of $15.84 billion. Swiss drugmaker Novartis AG ( NOVN.VX ) also reported better-than expected first-quarter results on Tuesday. Its sales rose 14 percent, helped by demand for the company's new Gilenya pill to treat multiple sclerosis. Global sales of J&J's prescription drugs rose 7.5 percent to $6.1 billion, with contributions from older and newer medicines. Jonas called it a turnaround for the pharmaceuticals unit, which has reported anemic sales in recent years because of patent expirations on its Risperdal schizophrenia treatment and Topamax anti-convulsant, both former blockbusters. Sales of Concerta, used to treat attention deficit disorder, rose 10 percent to $362 million, while sales of antibiotic Levaquin rose 17 percent to $434 million. The company's biggest medicine, arthritis treatment Remicade, grew 8.3 percent to $1.29 billion, despite competition from rival biotech drugs such as Abbott Laboratories Inc's ( ABT.N ) Humira. Simponi, a newer arthritis treatment, posted sales of $95 million. J&J last week settled a two-year dispute with Merck & Co ( MRK.N ) that allows Merck to continue selling Remicade and Simponi overseas, but in fewer markets. J&J said it now expects earnings of $4.90 to $5.00 per share for 2011, from its prior view of $4.80 to $4.90. Chief Financial Officer Dominic Caruso told investors in a conference call that most of the increase was due to the weakening dollar, which raised the value of sales in overseas markets. J&J has recalled more than 300 million packages of Tylenol and other over-the-counter medicine in the past 16 months after regulators cited faulty procedures and other quality-control lapses at three factories. It is fixing the problems under supervision of the U.S. government. Caruso said the 2011 forecast would have been higher if not for plant upgrades and related factors, which weighed down the outlook by 12 cents a share, twice J&J's earlier estimate. "Shipments from the facilities will be slowed, or slowed down as we implement the quality procedures," Caruso said. Quarterly sales of consumer products fell 2.2 percent to $3.68 billion, with U.S. revenue of the product line falling 14 percent to $1.35 billion. But that was an improvement from a 29 percent decline in U.S. sales in the prior quarter. "I think we're seeing an inflection point in the consumer group," said Morningstar analyst Damien Conover. "You're beginning to get to where the company has had more time to fix some of the problems." J&J did not make any reference in its earnings report to reports that it was negotiating to acquire Swiss medical device maker Synthes Inc SYST.VX for about $20 billion, which would make it the biggest deal in J&J's history. Synthes on Monday had confirmed that it was in merger talks with J&J, which has declined to comment on the potential deal. Sales of J&J's medical devices rose 3.3 percent in the quarter to $6.43 billion. Company shares rose $1.96 to $62.42 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
