 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda said on Tuesday that U.S. Treasuries were still an attractive investment for Japan despite news that ratings agency Standard & Poor's cut the U.S. credit outlook due to concerns about the rising federal budget deficit. 

 "The United States is tackling fiscal issues in various ways, so I think U.S. Treasuries are basically an attractive product for us," Noda told a news conference after a cabinet meeting. He added that Japan must continue to convey its stance on adhering to fiscal discipline. (Reporting by  Tetsushi Kajimoto ; Editing by Edmund Klamann)
