 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Two of the world's biggest custody banks reported higher quarterly fee income as stronger financial markets and new business boosted assets. 

 Fee revenue climbed 16 percent to $1.79 billion at State Street Corp ( STT.N ), the industry No. 3, while Bank of New York Mellon ( BK.N ), the world's top custody bank, reported a 12 percent increase to $2.83 billion. At Northern Trust Corp ( NTRS.O ), the fourth-largest custody bank, non-interest income slipped 0.6 percent to $663.5 million. Known as trust banks, the companies earn the bulk of their profit for keeping records and providing accounting and other services to investment managers. Investors sent shares of State Street, a 273-year-old Boston-based company, up 3 percent after its earnings beat expectations, extending a streak intact for 18 of the last 19 quarters. But the others' share prices declined. BNY Mellon dipped 3.5 percent after its profit fell short of expectations, and Northern Trust dropped nearly 3 percent. Both State Street and BNY Mellon benefited from recent acquisitions as well as stronger financial markets, which helped boost assets under custody and administration. But each company still suffered from the low interest rate environment and felt the effects of low volatility, which held down currency trading. "The miss was primarily due to persistently low interest rates, weak foreign exchange and increased pension and/or litigation expenses," Janney Capital Markets analyst Thomas McCrohan wrote in a research note about BNY Mellon. State Street said its foreign exchange revenue rose 19 percent as higher volumes offset lower volatility. At BNY Mellon, foreign exchange revenue dropped 1 percent from a year ago and 16 percent from the 2010 fourth quarter because of lower volatility. The companies' foreign exchange business has come under fire recently. Pension fund customers have sued the companies, charging they were cheated on trades. The companies have denied the allegations, and their chief executives said on Tuesday the business has not been hurt by the lawsuits. "Foreign exchange makes up only 6 percent of our revenue but it has been a topic of interest recently," BNY Mellon Chief Executive Robert Kelly said in an interview. "It is an extremely competitive segment." Kelly said BNY Mellon hopes to attract new business in this area by spending more time with customers and being more "creative and aggressive" in developing new products. BNY Mellon's earnings from continuing operations, excluding special items, rose to $699 million, or 55 cents a share, from $601 million, or 49 cents a share, a year earlier. Assets under custody and administration rose 2 percent from the 2010 fourth quarter to a record $25.5 trillion, Analysts had expected earnings of 57 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. At State Street, earnings excluding special items rose to $444 million, or 88 cents a share, from $371 million, or 75 cents a share, a year earlier, beating analysts' forecast of 86 cents a share. Assets under custody and administration rose 5 percent to $22.6 trillion. Both State Street and BNY Mellon recently announced plans to raise their dividends and execute share buybacks after passing the Federal Reserve's second round of stress tests. Northern Trust said net income slipped to $151 million, or 61 cents a share, from $157.2 million, or 64 cents a share, a year earlier.
