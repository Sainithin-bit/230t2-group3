 SHANGHAI  (Reuters) - Volvo Car expects to sell 450,000 cars globally this year, up from about 380,000 last year, the company's vice chairman, Hans-Olov Olsson, said on Tuesday. 

 He gave the outlook to Reuters on the sidelines of the Shanghai auto show. "It's progressing very positively, we are building a new company, in China and in Sweden," Olsson said, of the takeover of Volvo Car last year by China's Zhejiang Geely, which also owns Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd. ( 0175.HK ). (Reporting by Fang Yan and  Ken Wills )
