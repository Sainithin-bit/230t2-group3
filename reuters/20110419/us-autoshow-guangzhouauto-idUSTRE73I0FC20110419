 SHANGHAI  (Reuters) - Guangzhou Automobile Group Co Ltd ( 2238.HK ), China's No. 6 domestic automaker, plans to sell 200,000 new energy cars by 2015, the company said in a statement issued at the Shanghai Auto show. 

 Guangzhou Auto, a Chinese partner of Japan's Honda Motor ( 7267.T ), Toyota Motor Co ( 7203.T ) and Fiat SpA ( FIA.MI ), is seeking a listing on the Shanghai stock exchange through a merger with its unit GAC Changfeng Motor Co Ltd 600991.SS. It planned to convert Changfeng, which makes vehicles with Mitsubishi and other brand names and provides automobile components, into a 50/50 joint venture with Japan's Mitsubishi Motors Corp ( 7211.T ).
