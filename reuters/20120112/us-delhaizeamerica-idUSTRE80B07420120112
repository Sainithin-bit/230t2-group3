 (Reuters) - Supermarket operator Delhaize America said it will close 113 underperforming Food Lion stores mainly in markets in which the company has the least store density and will cut 4,900 jobs to focus on markets with high density. 
 Delhaize America, which has more than 1,600 stores in 16 states in the eastern United States, also operates under the banners Bottom Dollar Food, Harveys, Hannaford Supermarkets, Reid's and Sweetbay. The company will convert 64 Bloom and Bottom Dollar Food stores in Maryland, North Carolina and Virginia to Food Lion stores. All affected stores will close within 30 days and store conversions will begin immediately, the company said. The company will provide severance to eligible employees, and will work with government officials to assist with transition support, Delhaize America said. Delhaize America has about 107,000 full-time and part-time employees. (Reporting by  Kavyanjali Kaushik  in Bangalore; Editing by Matt Driskill)
