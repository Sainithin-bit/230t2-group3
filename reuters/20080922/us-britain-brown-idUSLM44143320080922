 MANCHESTER  (Reuters) - Britain will spend more to help people in hard economic times and toughen regulation to curb financial market excesses, finance minister Alistair Darling said on Monday. 

 Darling's speech to the ruling Labour Party's annual conference marked a shift away from the light-touch regulation it has overseen and that has helped make London a world financial hub. Members of the centre-left party welcomed the speech at a time when Labour is seeking to show it is not a spent force after 11 years in power and Britain faces the risk of recession. Labour, led by Prime Minister Gordon Brown, has slipped in opinion polls over the past months as the economy slows, once-robust financial institutions crumble, prices rise and more Britons lose their jobs. The deepening of the financial crisis could play to the strengths of Brown, who was finance minister for a decade. It could also allow the government to promote more left-wing policies which might appeal to a disillusioned public and traditional Labour voters. "It's clear we have to put in place measures to stop problems being repeated. It is clearer than ever that markets can't do this on their own," said Darling. Darling said the government was in a position to "let borrowing rise to support the economy and families when they need it most." GET BEHIND BROWN Darling told the party to unite behind Brown, who took over from Tony Blair 15 months ago without a leadership election. He said Brown was the right person to guide Britain through the crisis and called for an end to bickering about who should run the country. Brown faces calls to quit from some Labour members of parliament because there is concern he will not be able to overturn the party's deficit in the opinion polls before an election due by 2010. Four junior members of the government quit or were sacked last week after calling for Brown to go. Foreign minister David Miliband, touted as a potential leadership challenger, also backed the prime minister in his speech, saying that having Brown as leader made a difference on the world stage. Brown still has supporters among the thousands of party delegates attending its annual conference. "We're convinced that Gordon Brown's the best person and it's now about getting the message across about what we are doing," said Pauline Allen, a Labour Party member from Nottingham in central England. The financial crisis and how to deal with it has become the central policy issue for this year's Labour conference, overshadowing the leadership speculation. The economy, once the jewel in the party's crown, has been hit by the global credit crunch and is on the brink of recession for the first time since 1992. In his speech, Darling attacked the multi-million pound bonuses paid to City of London bankers for pushing them to take excessive risk which triggered the financial crisis last year. "Bonuses should encourage good long-term decisions, not short-term reckless ones," he said. (Editing by  Keith Weir )
