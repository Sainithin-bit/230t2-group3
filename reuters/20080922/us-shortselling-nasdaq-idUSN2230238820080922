 (Reuters) - Nasdaq OMX Group ( NDAQ.O ) has added the shares of 66 companies that engage in financial services to the temporary ban on short selling ordered by U.S. regulators last week. 

 The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was besieged by complaints that its original list of 799 companies issued on Friday had missed other companies with financial operations. The SEC decided over the weekend to let the exchanges add to the list. The SEC emergency order against short sales in financial stocks is set to last through October 2. It may be extended further if the agency deems it necessary, but can only last a total of 30 calendar days.
