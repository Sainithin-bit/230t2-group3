 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - The European Commission said on Monday it welcomed U.S. plans to stabilize the financial system but wanted to see more details. 

 The U.S. administration has invited other countries to back the rescue plan. "The Commission welcomes the U.S. action to stabilize the financial system," a Commission spokesman told a news briefing. "We cannot comment in detail at this point in time as the details are still being worked out by the U.S. administration and Congress. The Commission continues to follow the situation closely," the spokesman said. (Reporting by  Huw Jones , editing by Jan Strupczewski)
