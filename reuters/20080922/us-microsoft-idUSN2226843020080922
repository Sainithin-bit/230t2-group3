 SEATTLE  (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp ( MSFT.O ), Hewlett-Packard Co ( HPQ.N ) and Nike Inc ( NKE.N ) said on Monday they plan to buy back up to $53 billion of their own shares at a time when most U.S. companies are slowing the rate of share repurchases to hoard cash over liquidity concerns. 

 Microsoft said it plans to buy back up to $40 billion of its own stock over the next five years, while HP plans to repurchase up to $8 billion worth of its own stock and Nike unveiled a $5 billion share buyback program. Recent market declines have driven down valuations, making share buybacks a more attractive use of capital. Howard Silverblatt, a senior analyst at Standard & Poor's, said many cash-rich companies are holding tightly to their cash during the financial market turbulence with buybacks falling below $100 billion in the second quarter, the lowest levels since the third quarter of 2005. "They are choosing not to spend a lot on share buybacks," said Silverblatt, noting that many companies are now only buying back shares to offset share dilution, not to drive down the share count to raise earnings per share. Many companies also opt not to use the entire share buyback allotment authorized to them by their board of directors. One of the most cash-rich companies in the tech industry, Microsoft introduced a $2 billion commercial paper program and said it may issue as much as $6 billion of debt. Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service assigned their top credit ratings to Microsoft. "The openness to debt was the most surprising of this morning's announcements and is a positive signal of management's increasing openness to developing a more efficient capital structure," wrote Charles Di Bona, a research analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, in a note to clients. Microsoft shares rose 33 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $25.39 on the Nasdaq. The stock is down 27 percent in the year to date, compared with a 16 percent slide on the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. The company, which had $23.7 billion in cash on its balance sheet at the end of June, also said it would pay a quarterly dividend of 13 cents a share, up from 11 cents a share. Microsoft has been aggressive in buying back shares. It started a $36.2 billion five-year share repurchase program in 2006, but spent that amount in two years. Since the fourth quarter of 2004, Microsoft has repurchased $67 billion of its own stock, according to S&P. By comparison, H-P has bought back nearly $30 billion worth of stock while Nike has repurchased $3.4 billion of its own shares. HP, the world's largest PC manufacturer, said its latest share repurchase authorization comes on top of the $8 billion buyback program approved by the board in November 2007. The company had $14.8 billion in cash on its balance sheet as of July 31. "The way we look at it is a vote of confidence in the company's ability to generate strong cash flow and also a vote of confidence in its stock price," said Shaw Wu, analyst at American Technology in San Francisco. "The stock price has held up really well -- they feel it's undervalued and feel it's a good use of their cash. Any vote of confidence in this climate is a good thing." HP shares, which have fallen 6 percent, fell $1.12, or 2.3 percent, to $47.14 in late trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Nike shares were down 13 cents on the NYSE.
