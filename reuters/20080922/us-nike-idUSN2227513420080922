 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Athletic shoe and clothing maker Nike Inc ( NKE.N ) said on Monday that it planned to repurchase an additional $5 billion of its own stock over four years. 

 The company said the new buyback would start after the completion of its current four-year, $3 billion program, which was approved in June 2006. As of May 31, when Nike's fiscal year ended, the company had spent $2.1 billion under the current program. A Nike spokeswoman was not immediately available to provide further details on the timing of the announcement. Also on Monday, computer maker Hewlett-Packard Co ( HPQ.N ) said it would spend $8 billion buying back shares, while Microsoft Corp ( MSFT.O ) announced a stock repurchase of up to $40 billion. Nike shares were up 43 cents at $64.13 in morning New York Stock Exchange trade. (Reporting by  Martinne Geller ; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
