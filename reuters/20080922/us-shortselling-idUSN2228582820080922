 (Reuters) - The New York Stock Exchange has added 
30 stocks of companies that engage in financial services to a 
temporary ban on short selling ordered last week by U.S. 
regulators. 

 The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, besieged by 
complaints that its list of 799 stocks issued on Friday had 
missed companies with major financial operations, decided over 
the weekend to let exchanges add to its list. The SEC emergency order against short sales in financial 
stocks will last through October 2. It may be extended further if 
the agency deems it necessary, but it can only last a total of 
30 calendar days. Following is the list of NYSE stocks:
