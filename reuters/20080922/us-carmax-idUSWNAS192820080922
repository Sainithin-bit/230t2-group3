 DETROIT  (Reuters) - CarMax Inc ( KMX.N ), the largest U.S. retailer of used cars, reported a 78 percent drop in quarterly profit and said economic uncertainty made it almost impossible to predict when the industry would recover. 

 Shares of the company fell nearly 4 percent. "The slowdown in the economy and reductions in consumer spending power resulting from higher gasoline and food costs continued to create a difficult environment for our business," CarMax Chief Executive Tom Folliard said on Monday. "There is so much volatility in the marketplace right now," Folliard said. "It's almost impossible to predict the next six months or a year." Net income fell to $14 million, or 6 cents per share, in the second quarter ended August 31 from $65 million, or 29 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected the Richmond, Virginia-based company to earn 10 cents per share. Net revenue fell 13 percent to $1.84 billion. The U.S. auto business has been hammered by a slowing economy and tighter consumer credit, as well as slumping demand for trucks and SUVs. CarMax said last month that it would delay the planned openings of several stores due to a sharp drop in vehicle sales in past months amid record-high gasoline prices. It had reduced store staffing levels and was evaluating all open positions to control costs. The company has also suspended its earnings forecast for the fiscal year ending in February. It had previously called for full-year profit of 78 cents to 94 cents per share. The bottom of that range would represent a 6 percent drop from last year. CarMax shares were down 61 cents, or 3.7 percent, at $15.89 in morning New York Stock Exchange trade. (Reporting by Soyoung Kim; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
