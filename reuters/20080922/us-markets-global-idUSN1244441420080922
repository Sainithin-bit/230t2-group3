 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A chorus of concern about the cost and lack of details about the U.S. government's $700 billion bailout of troubled banks dragged down global stocks, government debt and the dollar on Monday and drove up the price of gold. 

 U.S. gold futures jumped nearly 4 percent on safe-haven buying as analyst after analyst worried about the final shape of the bailout plan, with U.S. lawmakers calling for changes from the Treasury Department's proposal. Euro zone government bonds hit a six-week low, extending losses from late last week, and U.S. Treasuries also fell as investors fretted the plan would require more U.S. government debt issuance, boosting the yield on longer-dated debt. Crude oil rose more than $3 a barrel as investors and traders in the oil market took a different view of the bailout plan, driving optimism it will stabilize the U.S. economy. Uncertainty about the bailout plan drove down the shares of leading European companies and Wall Street more than 2 percent, and analysts said they could not gauge the ultimate cost and form of the plan. "It's just too big to analyze on a one-day view," said John Haynes, strategist at Rensburg Sheppards. "The Fed, I think, is going to win in the end, but as to whether stocks go up or down in the next three months, it's the toss of a coin." While investors hoped the plan will resolve a year-long credit crisis that has begun to be felt on Main Street, its size and cost sparked widespread concerns. "There is too much unknown," said Peter Mueller, interest rate strategist at Commerzbank. "The big question is what will be the price?" As has been the case whenever investors have worried about the impact of the credit crisis, banks were the big losers on both sides of the Atlantic. Five major U.S. banks were the biggest drag on the benchmark S&P 500, led by shares of JPMorgan Chase ( JPM.N ), which fell almost 10 percent. Before 1 p.m., the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was down 185.81 points, or 1.63 percent, at 11,202.63. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was down 23.99 points, or 1.91 percent, at 1,231.09. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was down 45.14 points, or 1.99 percent, at 2,228.76. HSBC ( HSBA.L ), Europe's biggest bank, fell 5.8 percent and was the biggest drop on the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of top European shares. Shares in Holcim ( HOLN.VX ), the world's second largest cement maker, were among the top losers in Europe, falling 18 percent after Russian cement maker Eurocement took a 6.5 percent stake. Eurocement said it did not intend to bid for the Swiss group. The U.S. dollar hit fresh three-week lows against the euro, weighed down by concerns about the budgetary impact of the U.S. bailout plan. The euro rose as high as $1.4660 versus the dollar, the highest since September 1, according to Reuters Dealing. "Nobody knows what form the bailout package will take," said Ron Simpson, director of currency research at Action Economics in Tampa, Florida. "We only know vaguely how much it will cost. So if you are a foreigner and looking at the U.S. fiscal position it does not look pretty for this year and next." The euro rose 1.82 percent at $1.4727. The dollar fell against major currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index .DXY off 1.31 percent at 76.559. Against the yen, the dollar fell 1.11 percent at 106.23. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell 21/32 to yield 3.90 percent. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond shed 44/32 to yield 4.47 percent. U.S. light sweet crude oil rose $5.91 to $110.46 a barrel. "The key driver continues to be the U.S. rescue package which has changed the sentiment in the oil market," said Bank of Ireland analyst Paul Harris. "Oil had fallen back below $100 a barrel last week on demand worries, but the package has gone some way to easing those concerns. However, I don't think there is enough clarity yet to see prices go significantly higher." News that China increased crude imports by 11.54 percent in August over a year earlier also supported oil prices. And industry sources on Monday said that top oil exporter Saudi Arabia has trimmed oil supplies to international major and U.S. refiners since the start of September. Spot gold prices rose $27.45 to $898.60. Asian stocks climbed overnight. Japan's Nikkei share average  .N225  closed up 1.4 percent, after hitting a three-year low last week. Outside of Japan, stocks in the Asia-Pacific region were up 2.4 percent, bouncing further from a two-year low plumbed on Thursday, according to an MSCI index .MIAPJ0000PUS.
