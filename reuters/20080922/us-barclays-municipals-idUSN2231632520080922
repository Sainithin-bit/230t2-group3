 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Barclays Capital ( BARC.L ) on Monday said it was absorbing some of Lehman Brothers LEHMQ.PK LEH.N municipal bond businesses, including underwriting, trading, sales and derivative "solutions." 

 But a Barclays spokesman could not immediately say whether the British bank, now selecting which assets and employees it wants from Lehman, would take on the bankrupt bank's swaps contracts. States, cities, hospitals, turnpikes and the like have entered into billions of dollars of swap contracts with Lehman and other investment banks. Many muni issuers are hunting for new counterparties because so many swaps with Lehman were automatically ended by its bankruptcy. (Reporting by  Joan Gralla  in New York; Editing by  Chizu Nomiyama )
