 ROME  (Reuters) - Alitalia AZPIa.MI will lose its operating license if a special administrator making a last-ditch attempt to sell the airline does not give Italy's aviation authority a credible new offer or cost-cutting plan by Thursday. 

 Following the withdrawal of an Italian rescue bid because of opposition by pilots and cabin crew, the government-appointed administrator made a last attempt on Monday to attract offers, although previous bids to find a foreign buyer have failed. Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's spokesman Paolo Bonaiuti acknowledged that "buyers are not queuing up for Alitalia". Pilots and crew attempted to attract alternatives to the CAI consortium's rescue bid on Monday by saying they would put up their own pay and pensions, totaling 340 million euros, "to back any serious, credible project for the relaunch of Alitalia". But so far, the only interest has been in the state-controlled airline's heavy maintenance and cargo units as well as in leasing unused aircraft and laid-off staff. On Monday, Swiss investment firm AMA Asset Management Advisers said it was interested in buying or renting 30 Alitalia planes. Flights continued as usual but Alitalia faces being grounded, and its assets liquidated, if there is no last-minute decision by dissenting unions to accept the job cuts and slimmed-down contracts that the CAI consortium had offered. "Alitalia is flying with a provisional license," the head of aviation body ENAC, Vito Riggio, told local radio ahead of talks with special administrator Augusto Fantozzi early on Monday. He said afterwards that Fantozzi was given until Thursday to present "a report on the company's prospects, any offers to buy it or a cost-cutting plan" in order to keep its license. ENAC would then have three days to evaluate the response, but Fantozzi himself told reporters: "If my report does not satisfy the authority, I will seek the suspension of the license." Suffering from the high fuel prices and economic downturn that have hit the airline sector globally, Alitalia has been on the brink of collapse for years as political interference and labor unrest bled it of cash and caused it to pile up debt. Berlusconi, who made an election vow to rescue the airline, said this weekend no foreign rival would step in and that the national carrier, which employs 19,000 people, may be doomed to bankruptcy. NO OFFERS Fantozzi invited offers of interest in all or part of Alitalia by September 30, without its debts, via the company's website  here "The only significant offer ... was withdrawn," Fantozzi said in the statement. "Therefore, the special administrator intends to verify the existence of other interested parties." He told daily paper Il Messagero on Sunday the tender would just "formalize what I have been doing -- without any results so far -- regarding the main assets". Fantozzi has renewed contacts with Air France ( AIRF.PA ), Lufthansa ( LHAG.DE ) and British Airways BAY.L, but said: "Nobody has stepped forward." A tender for the state's 49.9 percent stake by the previous centre-left government attracted 11 bidders who all pulled out. A second attempt led to Air France-KLM being picked as buyer but the deal met opposition from unions and Berlusconi, who was campaigning for office and said Alitalia must stay Italian. The media mogul returned to power in May and rallied 16 investors in the CAI consortium, which finally withdrew its offer on Thursday. The government has ruled out further state aid or the denationalization of Alitalia.
