 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of American International Group Inc ( AIG.N ) rose 27 percent on Monday after a report that some leading shareholders are searching for a way to keep the company from being effectively taken over by the Federal Reserve. 

 It was the third day of gains for the stock, which hit its all-time low last Tuesday, just before the company was bailed out by the Federal Reserve with an $85 billion loan to help it recover from massive losses it suffered on mortgage derivatives. Under last week's deal, brokered by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, the Federal Reserve would take an almost 80 percent stake in the insurer, diluting the existing shareholders' ownership. According to a report in the Wall Street Journal on Monday, citing an unnamed person familiar with the matter, major shareholders are looking for ways to quickly sell assets and raise capital to pay off the Federal Reserve loan, thereby keeping AIG independent. It did not name any shareholders in particular, but noted that AIG investors such as Bill Miller of Legg Mason Inc ( LM.N ) and former AIG director Eli Broad banded together earlier this year in their successful push to remove Martin Sullivan, chief executive of AIG. AIG shares rose $1.04 to $4.89 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by  Bill Rigby ; editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)
