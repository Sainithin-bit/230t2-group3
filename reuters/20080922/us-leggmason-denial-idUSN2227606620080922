 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Asset manager Legg Mason Inc ( LM.N ) said on Monday it was not looking to go private, denying a report in The New York Post. 

 Legg said in a statement its current business strategy has not changed. The Post had cited sources as saying Legg had been weighing a move that could see one or more private-equity investors, including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co KKR.UL, buy it and spin off many of its numerous funds. A Legg Mason spokesperson had told the paper it was "categorically untrue" that the company was in talks surrounding going private. A Kohlberg Kravis Roberts spokesperson declined to comment to the paper.
