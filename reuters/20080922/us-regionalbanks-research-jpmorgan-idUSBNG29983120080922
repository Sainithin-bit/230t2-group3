 (Reuters) - Investors should sell U.S. mid-sized regional banks' shares and take profits as these stocks may only have an indirect benefit from the U.S. government's rescue plan for troubled banks, a J.P. Morgan Securities analyst said. 

 U.S. authorities have proposed a $700 billion bailout plan, which will help troubled banks to offload hundreds of billions of dollars of bad debt from their balance sheets. However, analyst Steven Alexopoulos said once the temporary ban on short selling financials is lifted, a better buying opportunity will likely be created. Banks with residential construction portfolios in Nevada, Arizona and Florida will see near-term benefits of the Treasury's plan as there is pent up demand for real estate given an inability of potential borrowers to secure credit, Alexopoulos wrote in a note to clients. Alexopoulos believes the Treasury's plan, which will reintroduce liquidity into the banking system and mortgage market, could set the platform for an eventual recovery of the housing market. "Any improvement in the ability of homebuilders to sell homes means cash flow to repay debt," Alexopoulos said. Alexopoulos sees Synovus Financial and Colonial BancGroup as the prime beneficiaries of the Treasury's plan, but said he was incrementally more cautious on the quality of home equity loans and remained "underweight" on TCF Financial. Shares of regional banks had rallied on Friday as government's efforts, including temporary ban on short selling and the rescue plan, to restore stability in the financial markets was cheered by investors. The KBW Regional Banking index, which closed up 5 percent at 87.27 on Friday, was down 8 percent at 80.0 Monday morning. (Reporting by Sweta Singh in Bangalore; Editing by Deepak Kannan)
