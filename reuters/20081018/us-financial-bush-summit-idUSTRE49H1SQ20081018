 CAMP DAVID, Maryland  (Reuters) - U.S. President George W. Bush said on Saturday he would host a global summit in the near future to look at strategies to combat the global financial crisis. 

 "It is essential that we work together because we are in this crisis together," Bush said before a meeting at the Camp David presidential retreat with French President Nicolas Sarkozy and European Union President Jose Manuel Barroso. (Reporting by  Tabassum Zakaria ; editing by  Sandra Maler )
