 OTTAWA  (Reuters) - Canada's industry ministry will review the C$6.1 billion ($6.2 billion) takeover of grain handler Viterra VT.TO by Glencore International ( GLEN.L ) and has been informed Glencore will file an application for approval soon, a government spokesman said on Tuesday. 
 Under Canada's foreign investment law, any large acquisition of a Canadian company by a foreign investor is subject to a government review to determine whether it is of "net benefit" to the country. "The investor has informed officials that an application will be filed soon," said Michel Cimpaye, a spokesman for Industry Canada. "The minister of industry only approves an application where he is satisfied that an investment is likely to be of net benefit to Canada," he said.
