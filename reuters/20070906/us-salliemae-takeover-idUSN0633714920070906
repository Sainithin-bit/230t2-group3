 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Final legislation that would slash federal subsidies to student lenders could be bad news for the threatened $25 billion takeover of student loan company Sallie Mae by a group of private equity firms and banks, an analyst said on Thursday. 

 The White House said Thursday that President George W. Bush will sign into law the bill that will cut federal subsidies to student loan firms and boost student grant funding. The bill will give the buyers of the student lender more leverage to demand a price cut, said Stanford Group Co student loan industry analyst Jaret Seiberg in a research note. Seiberg said the legislation improves the odds that Sallie Mae's buyers could win any court fight over whether the legislation would constitute a "material adverse effect" to the existing deal. The leveraged buyout has a breakup fee of $900 million, but the buyers would not have to pay it if they could prove that the legislation had a material adverse effect on the transaction. "We continue to believe that a Delaware Chancery Court judge would be dubious of any effort to declare a material adverse effect," said Seiberg. However, Seiberg said the buyer group now has a stronger case to prove that the legislation could have a material adverse effect on the deal, giving it "more leverage to demand a price cut and certainly improves the odds that it could win a court fight." Sallie Mae and the buyer group declined to comment Thursday. In April, Sallie Mae accepted the leveraged buyout proposal worth $60 per share from J.C. Flowers & Co, Friedman Fleischer & Lowe, Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) and JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ). Since then, however, the buyers have threatened to scuttle the deal, blaming the proposals to cut government subsidies to student lenders. On July 11, Sallie Mae said the buyers believed that current legislative proposals "could result in a failure of the conditions to the closing of the merger to be satisfied." Sallie Mae said it disagreed with this assertion. OVERHAUL On August 15, Sallie Mae, which is officially called SLM Corp SLM.N, said its shareholders approved the $25 billion acquisition, but investor doubts about the deal persist. Concerns about the transaction have pushed Sallie Mae shares far below the buyout price, and analysts say the buyers may try to negotiate a lower price or kill the deal. Sallie Mae shares closed down 43 cents to $48.67 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday afternoon. Bankers and lawyers are working hard to save the deal -- one of the biggest leveraged buyouts in history -- but some legal experts and analysts have said it could become embroiled in litigation. On Wednesday, the Congress moved to overhaul of the student-loan industry, agreeing on final legislation that would slash federal subsidies to lenders and increase student grants. And the White House confirmed the president will sign the measure into law. "The president does intend to sign it," Emily Lawrimore, a White House spokeswoman, said. "We are pleased that in the conference report Congress answered the president's call to significantly increase funding for Pell grants," she said. Usually awarded only to undergraduate students who have not earned a bachelor's or professional degree, a Federal Pell Grant, unlike a loan, does not have to be repaid. Stanford Group's Seiberg said his firm expects the House and Senate to approve the legislation by Friday. (Reporting by Mark McSherry and  Kevin Drawbaugh )
