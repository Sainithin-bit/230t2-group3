 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Clothing company Kellwood Co KWD.N, which owns the Baby Phat and Nautica brands, reported a net loss on Thursday versus a year-ago profit and said it is restructuring to have fewer operating divisions. 

 Kellwood posted a net loss for the fiscal second quarter ended August 4 of $65.8 million, or $2.54 per share, compared to a net profit of $7.2 million, or 28 cents per share, a year ago. The results included restructuring and impairment charges. Kellwood said the restructuring will reduce its total number of divisions to eight from 12.
