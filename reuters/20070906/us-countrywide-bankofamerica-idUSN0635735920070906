 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Countrywide Financial Corp CFC.N shares on Thursday fell below the $18 price at which Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) may convert its $2 billion investment into common stock. 

 It was the first time the shares have dipped that low since the infusion was announced two weeks ago. Bank of America, the second-largest U.S. bank, on August 22 bought preferred stock yielding 7.25 percent, convertible into common stock at $18. Investors said that reflected confidence that Countrywide, the largest U.S. mortgage lender, could survive a liquidity shortage resulting from investor resistance to buying its loans and debt. Countrywide shares rose as high as $24.24 the next day, giving Bank of America a large paper profit. Since mid-August, Countrywide has announced 1,400 layoffs, including 900 on Wednesday, and said it will start offering mainly loans that meet Fannie Mae FNM.N and Freddie Mac FRE.N purchase requirements, which investors consider safer. The Calabasas, California-based company had added more than 6,900 jobs from January to July, often hiring from smaller rivals that were cutting back. "Countrywide has been criticized for adding to staff in a declining market, and the job cuts are what they should be doing as the mortgage market contracts significantly," said Blake Howells, who helps invest $2.6 billion at Beckers Capital Management in Portland, Oregon, which owns Countrywide shares. Shares of Countrywide fell as low as $17.95 in morning trading. They closed down 33 cents, or 1.8 percent, at $18.48 on the New York Stock Exchange, and are down 56 percent this year. Howells said the shares are unlikely to drop much further, but for the time being, "Bank of America can collect the coupon payment, which is pretty attractive." Bank of America did not immediately return a call for comment. Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis had on August 22 said: "In the current turmoil, the stock market has been underestimating the value in Countrywide's operations and assets." Dozens of mortgage lenders have curtailed lending this year as defaults soared, home price appreciation stopped, and investors have stopped buying many loans. Much of the weakness has focused on subprime lenders, which make loans to people with poor credit. Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEH.N on Thursday announced 850 mortgage-related layoffs, two weeks after closing its U.S. subprime lending business and firing 1,200 people. Meanwhile, Cleveland-based National City Corp NCC.N, which sold its First Franklin Financial Corp. subprime unit last year to Merrill Lynch & Co MER.N, said it is scaling back its remaining mortgage operations and laying off 1,300 workers, resulting in a $200 million pretax charge. National City is the ninth-largest U.S. bank. Also on Thursday, the Mortgage Bankers Association said the rate of U.S. home loans entering foreclosure rose to a seasonally adjusted 0.65 percent in the April-June period, the third straight quarterly record. One in seven subprime borrowers were delinquent on home loans, it said. Countrywide made $245.1 billion, or 17.4 percent, of U.S. mortgage loans from January to June, according to the Inside Mortgage Finance newsletter. Analysts expect this market share to decline, perhaps significantly, over the rest of the year. (Additional reporting by Patrick Rucker in Washington, D.C. and  Dan Wilchins  in New York)
