 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Limited Brands Inc ( LTD.N ) said on Thursday sales at stores open at least a year rose 1 percent in August, in line with the retailer's expectations, but it expects same-store sales to be flat in September. 

 Analysts on average had expected a same-store sales gain of 1.2 percent over the four weeks ended September 1, according to Reuters Estimates. Same-store sales, a key measure of retail health, rose 1 percent at Bath & Body Works, were flat at its Victoria's Secret chain, and fell 4 percent at its La Senza chain. At Victoria's Secret, the company said gains in its beauty products and line of Pink clothing targeting younger women were partially offset by declines of its lingerie. Net sales for the operator of the Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works chains were $565.2 million, down from $638.8 million in the same period last year.
