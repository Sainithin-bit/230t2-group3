 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Anheuser-Busch Cos Inc ( BUD.N ) said on Thursday that it continues to expect accelerated sales and earnings growth in the second half of the year and earnings per share growth for the full year to exceed its long-term objective of 7 percent to 10 percent. 

 The comments were made in a presentation at the Lehman Brothers Consumer Conference. So far in the current quarter, total sales from wholesalers to retailers were up 2.4 percent, the company said, with both new brands, such as Corona and Stella Artois, and core brands, such as Budweiser and Bud Light, contributing to growth. The company also said revenue per barrel was up 2.7 percent in the first half of the year, helped by a greater contribution of higher-priced products. It expects to significantly exceed that during the second half of the year. It added that it plans to raise prices on the majority of its volume early next year, with some increases coming in the fourth quarter of this year. The company also said it is still targeting $300 million to $400 million in cost savings over the next four years.
