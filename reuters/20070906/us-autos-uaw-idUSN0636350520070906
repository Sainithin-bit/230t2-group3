 DETROIT  (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers (UAW) union has already taken steps to help turn around Detroit's Big Three automakers, the UAW president said on Thursday, just over a week before the expiration of its contract with the companies. 

 While declining to comment on ongoing contract negotiations, UAW president Ron Gettelfinger said the union has helped General Motors Corp ( GM.N ), Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) and Chrysler LLC reduce the number of workers eligible for "jobs bank" programs by agreeing to buyout programs that have cut over 55,000 factory jobs. Under the "jobs bank" provision, workers get paid nearly their full salaries if they are laid off. As part of the jobs bank, workers can do volunteer community work or go to school or just report to the plant. Automakers had indicated they would address that benefit in the talks aimed at replacing a labor contract expiring on September 14. Speaking to the Detroit Economic Club in Detroit, Gettelfinger, who had said earlier that the jobs bank was "not an issue" for the union in the talks, said Thursday the UAW deserved credit for working with the automakers to cut payrolls as plants are closed. Having given up union jobs, Gettelfinger has said he would not go into these talks "in a concessionary mode." He said the jobs bank grew because automakers were unable to follow through on a promise to create jobs if the union helped make plants more competitive. "I would say that the union kept its commitment," he said, adding, "We helped them get competitive." In his speech, Gettelfinger spoke about the need for a national health-care system, calling the current system a failure. "Health care should be a right, not just a privilege to those who can afford it," he said. All three automakers have said health-care costs are a big concern and need to be addressed during contract talks. GM, Ford and Chrysler have said they collectively spent more than $10 billion on health care in 2006. In the same year, the automakers lost more than $15 billion combined. Contract talks have continued with none of the parties commenting, and analysts have speculated the silence indicates some degree of progress. GM and Ford have proposed establishing a trust fund for health-care costs that would be administered by the UAW as part of the talks, sources have said. "I think there are a lot of ideas that make sense on paper that are going to be harder in practice to get done," Argus Research analyst Kevin Tynan said, referring to a trust fund. FUEL STANDARDS 'EXTREME' Gettelfinger criticized the U.S. Senate for trying to pass a bill that would increase the corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards by 40 percent to 35 miles per gallon for cars and trucks by 2020. "It makes no sense for Congress to put (forth) such extreme measures," Gettelfinger said. "It will have a major negative impact on the auto industry." He added that the increase in fuel standards would force automakers to lower production of their largest, most profitable models. The current law requires automakers to achieve a minimum mileage target for their domestic car fleets, providing them an incentive to keep small-car production in the United States. But the Senate bill eliminates the distinction between cars produced domestically and those made overseas. Gettelfinger said the elimination of that distinction would leave automakers with no incentive to make small cars in the U.S., causing a shift in production overseas. Gettelfinger said he supported another bill, sponsored by Rep. Baron Hill, a Democrat from Indiana, and Rep. Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, that would hike CAFE mandates to 35 miles per gallon for cars by 2022 and at least 32 miles per gallon for light trucks by 2022. That bill maintains the domestic-import distinction for cars. (Additional reporting by  Kevin Krolicki )
