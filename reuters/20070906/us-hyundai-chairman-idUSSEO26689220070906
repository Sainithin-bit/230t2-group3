 SEOUL  (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor Group ( 005380.KS ) chief Chung Mong-koo was handed a three-year suspended sentence by a South Korean appeals court on Thursday, upholding a fraud conviction by a lower court earlier this year but allowing him to continue running the world's sixth largest auto maker.
