 DETROIT  (Reuters) - The president of the United Auto Workers union said on Thursday he was confident that Chrysler LLC's new private equity owner would not look to "strip and flip" the struggling automaker. 

 Ron Gettelfinger, an outspoken critic of buyout firms, told reporters that the founder of Cerberus Capital Management LLC, Stephen Feinberg, had assured him of his commitment to turning around Chrysler rather than selling off its parts. "I am confident that they are not coming into this with an attitude of strip and flip," Gettelfinger said. He added, "I don't think they will own it forever, but they will take it public again, I assume." Cerberus acquired Chrysler in a $7.4 billion deal that closed last month.
