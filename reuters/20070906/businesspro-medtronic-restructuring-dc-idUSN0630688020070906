 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Medical device maker Medtronic Inc. 
( MDT.N ), feeling the pinch of a slowdown in one of its key 
markets, will eliminate about 900 jobs through early retirement 
packages, voluntary and involuntary separations, the company 
said in a filing. 

  Of those positions, 349 have been cut as of July 27, 2007.  The restructuring, to be completed by the end of its fiscal 
year in April 2008, is expected to generate annual savings of 
about $125 million.  Minneapolis-based Medtronic, which has about 37,000 
employees, competes with St. Jude Medical Inc ( STJ.N ) and 
Boston Scientific Corp ( BSX.N ) in the market for heart 
pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators, known 
as ICDs.  The ICD market has slowed dramatically since 2005 following 
a wave of product recalls, mostly by Guidant Corp., which was 
later acquired by Boston Scientific.  Separately, the company indicated that it intends to pursue 
the spin-off of Physio-Control, the wholly owned subsidiary 
that makes external defibrillators, emergency response systems 
and other support systems used by hospital emergency room 
personnel, after it resolves issues with the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration.  Earlier this year, the company suspended shipments of 
certain products because of quality problems. It currently is 
working with the FDA on taking corrective actions and those 
should be completed by the end of the year. Once the issues are 
resolved, it will proceed with the spinoff, the filing said.
