 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Apparel retailer J. Crew Group Inc. JCG.N on Wednesday posted a second-quarter net profit compared with a year-ago loss, helped by higher gross margins, and the company raised its full-year earnings outlook. 

 But a conservative guidance, and revenue results that fell short of analysts' expectations, prompted a nearly 8 percent share decline after hours. The seller of preppy, colorful clothing, which sells through its retail stores and a catalog, posted a quarterly net profit of $20.6 million, or 32 cents per share, compared with a net loss of $2.8 million, or 8 cents per share, a year earlier. Wall Street, on average, had expected earnings of 29 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. A 13 percent rise in sales to $304.7 million was shy of analysts' average estimate of $308.7 million, according to Reuters Estimates. Gross margins were 43.7 percent of revenues compared with 42.1 percent of revenues a year earlier, the company said. More effective sourcing, leveraged expenses, fewer markdowns, less returns and a better-than-expected 19 percent increase in direct-to-consumer sales all contributed to boost margins, Chief Executive Millard Drexler said on a conference call with analysts. "We are experiencing better-than-expected sales and lower returns than anticipated which obviously results in significantly better profitability," Drexler said of the catalog business. Looking to the third quarter, the company expects earnings to range between 35 cents and 37 cents a share, Chief Financial Officer Jim Scully said. Analysts, on average, are expecting earnings, excluding items, of 37 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. J. Crew -- which also operates a store for children called Crewcuts as well as a casual fashion chain called Madewell -- also raised its full-year earnings outlook to a range of $1.42 to $1.46 from an earlier range of $1.37 to $1.41. Wall Street, on average, has been expecting full-year earnings of $1.46, excluding items. "I just think people's expectations got ahead of themselves," said analyst Jennifer Black of Jennifer Black & Associates of the after-hours share drop. "I do think investors are being incredibly shortsighted." J. Crew said its long-term annual financial targets were for earnings per share to increase by more than 20 percent and same-store sales to rise in the mid-single-digit range. It said direct sales were expected to rise in the high-single digits and that net square footage would expand by between 7 percent and 9 percent. The company is planning to open its first J. Crew collection store on New York's Madison Avenue in the first half of 2008. Shares of J. Crew fell to $45.80 in extended trade after closing at $49.70, down 2 percent, on the New York Stock Exchange.
