 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A man carrying a fake gun and wearing dark camouflage paint on his face was being sought on Thursday for attempting to break into billionaire Warren Buffett's home in Omaha, Nebraska, police said. 

 The man rang the doorbell at about 10 p.m. on Wednesday, and Buffett's wife, Astrid, summoned a security guard, who encountered the man on the front porch. The guard was struck with a blunt object, but disarmed him and the man fled, police said. Warren Buffett was home at the time, police said. Neither he nor his wife were hurt. The guard was also unhurt. Police gave no description of the fake gun and said the guard had been hit by some other object. Buffett, 77, runs Berkshire Hathaway Inc, the insurance and investment company, and is one of the world's wealthiest people. He lives in an ungated, 5,830-square-foot home that he bought for about $32,000 in 1958. The home has an assessed value of $710,000. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel and  Andrew Stern  in Chicago)
