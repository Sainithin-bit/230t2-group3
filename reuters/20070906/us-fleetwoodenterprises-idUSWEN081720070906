 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Fleetwood Enterprises Inc. FLE.N, a maker of recreational vehicles and manufactured homes, said on Thursday it posted a fiscal first-quarter loss, mainly due to weak results from its travel trailer division. 

 The California-based company reported a quarterly loss of $2.35 million, or 4 cents a share, compared with a year-ago loss of $411,000, or 1 cents a share. "If conditions remain stable throughout the second quarter, we would expect to see results similar to those of the first quarter," said Elden Smith, the company's chief executive in a statement.
