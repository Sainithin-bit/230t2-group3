 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Campbell Soup Co ( CPB.N ) on Thursday posted a quarterly profit below analysts' estimates as the company overhauled its supply chain in Australia and Indonesia, pushing its stock down almost 4 percent. 

 Campbell also said it spent 15 percent more on marketing to help boost sales -- which rose almost 10 percent on strength in the V8 juice business -- and said higher costs for meeting increased beverage volume cut into margins. Sales in the U.S. soup, sauces and beverages business rose 8 percent despite flat soup sales. Baking and snack sales also rose 8 percent. "What surprised most, including me, was just how much they were spending in the quarter," said Matt Arnold, analyst at Edward Jones. "I don't think it's a top-line issue. The sales by and large looked fine." Investors will watch to see if the higher marketing spending will be needed to help lift sales going forward, Arnold said. "We certainly need some benefits from that in the coming year for the quarter's miss ... for the disappointment to abate," Arnold said. The largest U.S. soup maker said profit was $61 million, or 16 cents a share, in the fourth quarter ended July 29, compared with $44 million, or 11 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, earnings from continuing operations were 14 cents a share, compared with 19 cents a share a year earlier. On that basis, analysts on average forecast 18 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 9.6 percent to $1.59 billion. The fourth quarter is usually the lowest sales quarter for the company, since fewer people eat soup during the hot summer months. The company, which also makes Pepperidge Farm baked goods and is considering the sale of its Godiva chocolate business, has seen sales helped by new products like lower sodium soup. The company is also expanding its soup business into China and Russia. Gross margin for the quarter decreased to 40.1 percent from 41.9 percent a year ago due to costs from the streamlining of the supply chain in Australia and Indonesia and higher costs for meeting demand in the U.S. beverage business. Like most food companies, Campbell has also raised prices to try to offset higher costs for ingredients like flour, oils and dairy products. For fiscal year 2008, Campbell forecast a 5 percent to 7 percent increase in earnings per share from $1.95 in 2007, or $2.05 to $2.10 a share. Analysts on average forecast $2.14 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. "They are always conservative," Gregg Warren, analyst at Morningstar, said of the forecast. "They have never really stretched things out." Campbell also forecast an increase in sales above its 3 percent to 4 percent long-term target, in part because 2008 will have an extra week on the company's fiscal calendar. Campbell shares were off $1.34, or 3.5 percent, to $36.66 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange after hitting a session low of $36.65. The stock is down 4.7 percent this year, compared with a 2.7 percent increase in the Standard & Poor's packaged foods index .15GSPFOOD.
