 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ) is committed to keeping its fiscal 2008 capital spending at "no more than" $15.5 billion, a company executive said on Thursday. 

 "Our goal is to beat that number right now," said Vice Chairman and Chief Administrative Officer John Menzer, speaking at a Goldman Sachs retail conference. His comments were broadcast over the Internet. In June, Wal-Mart said it would cut the number of supercenters it plans to open this year by as much as 30 percent as it tries to boost sales at U.S. stores. At the time, the retailer said the new expansion strategy would lower Wal-Mart's fiscal year capital spending to $15.5 billion from $17 billion. It spent $15.66 billion on capital expenditures in fiscal 2007, according to the company's annual report. Wal-Mart is looking for ways to reduce construction costs so it can come in below the $15.5 billion figure, Menzer said. He added the slower growth plan Wal-Mart outlined in June should help boost its U.S. same-store sales results. Earlier in the day, Wal-Mart reported a better-than-expected 3.1 percent rise in August sales at its U.S. stores open at least a year after it cut prices to entice more back-to-school shoppers. He said the retailer's coordinated marketing and merchandising plans -- emphasizing low prices on back-to-school merchandise and then having those items in stock -- helped spur sales, and Wal-Mart expects to repeat the strategy for the holiday season, with a particular emphasis on low prices. He also said that if the retailer can get its apparel and home businesses back on track, it would provide "some wind in our sales" going into next year. This year, Wal-Mart has struggled to clear its stores of poor selling clothing and home goods, resulting in price cuts that have undermined its sales and margins. Eliminating the need for "excessive" markdowns should improve Wal-Mart's margins next year, he said, adding that the retailer has cut down on some apparel orders to avoid being in the same position next year. While Menzer said Wal-Mart has worked through many of its apparel issues, it is still working on its home business and "did not get what we wanted" from some initial efforts to remodel the home area. Menzer said Wal-Mart intends to continue to emphasize its low prices headed into the holiday season as its shoppers struggle with food and fuel inflation. "They are under some pressure," he said, but added that Wal-Mart is looking for a "solid second half" of the year.
