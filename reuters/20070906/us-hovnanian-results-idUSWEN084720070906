 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Upscale home builder Hovnanian Enterprises Inc ( HOV.N ) reported a quarterly loss on Thursday and warned that conditions in most of the regions it operates in remain challenging, suggesting the housing market slump that has hit the industry hard is far from over. 

 Hovnanian said it was responding to the tough environment by offering additional concessions and incentives to buyers. But it indicated it faced fresh head winds because the tighter standards that have brought lending in the so-called subprime space to a near standstill are spilling over into the market for jumbo mortgages. Even so, Hovnanian's shares rose in post-bell trading because the results met Wall Street expectations. For the quarter ended July 31, Hovnanian reported a loss of $80.5 million, or $1.27 a share, compared with a profit of $74.4 million, or $1.15 a share a year earlier. Sales tumbled 27 percent to $1.1 billion. Analysts, on average, expected the Red Bank, New Jersey-based company to report a loss of $1.27 a share on sales of $1.12 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. After several torrid years of growth, the U.S. housing market has seen demand steeply drop. Higher interest rates for home buyers who bought at low introductory rates and a credit crunch spurred by rising defaults have swelled the supply of homes for sale. Dozens of U.S. mortgage lenders have curtailed lending this year as defaults soared, home price appreciation ended and investors stopped buying many loans. Much of the weakness has focused on subprime lenders, but investors have grown increasingly worried about risks from "Alt-A" home loans, which fall between prime and subprime in quality" and "jumbo" prime mortgages once thought safe. "Buyer psychology has been negatively impacted by a steady stream of news related to falling housing prices, foreclosure rates and mortgage availability," said Ara Hovnanian, chief executive of home builder Hovnanian Enterprises Inc. "We expect the current challenging environment to persist through most of 2008," Hovnanian said. Hovnanian's results included a charge of $108.6 million related to land impairments and write-offs, within the $90 million to $110 million range it had forecast in August. As housing demand dwindled, land values have fallen and developers have slowed operations to avoid being saddled with homes they cannot sell. On August 13, Hovnanian said it closed on the sale of 31 percent fewer homes in the third quarter ended July 31 than it did a year earlier. Net new contracts for homes fell 24 percent, excluding unconsolidated joint ventures. The third-quarter cancellation rate was 35 percent, compared with 33 percent a year earlier. In after-hours trading, shares were up 48 cents, or 4.2 percent, after closing at $11.37, more than retracing a 3.7 percent loss during the regular session on the New York Stock Exchange.
