 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The number of workers seeking jobless aid fell more than expected last week and the service sector grew steadily in August, according to data on Thursday that pointed to economic strength despite credit market turmoil and a slumping housing market. 

 Signs of vigor could also be seen in better-than-expected August sales at major retailers, led by discounters Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ) and Target Corp ( TGT.N ), who got a back-to-school boost as consumers spent heartily. The slew of reports offered a fresh take on the economy's health at a time financial markets are fairly convinced tightening credit conditions will lead the U.S. Federal Reserve to lower benchmark interest rates at meeting on September 18. In addition to the heartening data on jobless claims and service sector growth, a third report showed U.S. worker productivity was stronger in the second quarter than earlier estimated, welcome news for a central bank that had spent much of the year worrying about inflation. "We got a trifecta of good economic reports today," said Richard Huber, economist at A.G. Edwards and Sons in St. Louis. The Labor Department said the number of applications last week for state unemployment benefits dropped 19,000 to a seasonally adjusted 318,000. Analysts were expecting a decline of about a third of that amount. "It doesn't really seem to me that things are as bad as people are making them to be. There might not necessarily be a good case for a rate cut," said Cleveland Rueckert, market analyst at Birinyi Associates Inc. in Stamford, Connecticut. U.S. stocks rose, and prices for U.S. government bonds dipped, but persistent signs of trouble limited the losses. Separate data from the Mortgage Bankers Association showed the percentage of U.S. mortgages entering foreclosure hit a record high in the second quarter. "You are seeing the offset probably more of the mortgage data ruling the roost in terms of the Treasury market's reaction because that seems to be the more sensitive part of the equation right now," said Kevin Flanagan, fixed-income strategist for global wealth management with Morgan Stanley in Purchase, New York. SERVICE SECTOR/RETAIL STEADY U.S. service sector growth held steady in August, although employment conditions deteriorated to their weakest in nearly five years, according to the Institute for Supply Management. The services index held at 55.8, signaling further growth in the sector. "We are getting mixed messages on the economy -- looks like tight credit is slowing business down," ISM's respondents from the professional, scientific and technical services sectors said. The services sector represents about 80 percent of U.S. economic activity and includes business like restaurants, hotels, banks and airlines. On the retail front, retail leader Wal-Mart posted a 3.1 percent same-store sales rise for August as it aggressively cut prices on school supplies to entice shoppers.
