 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A U.S. judge dismissed criminal charges against 13 of 16 former employees of accounting firm KPMG in a tax-shelter case on Monday, saying that prosecutors inappropriately interfered with their defense. 

 U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan said in a written ruling that the government's case could go forward against three of the defendants, as well as against two defendants who were never employed by KPMG. The ruling, which was expected after the government conceded that dismissing charges against most defendants was the only way forward, still comes as a setback for prosecutors. "It's a severe lesson for the Justice Department," said Anthony Sabino, a professor of business law at St. John's University's Tobin College of Business. "I think they'll accept this defeat gracefully because in large part it was clearly coming." The U.S. Attorney's office declined to comment. The decision to dismiss the indictments against 13 of the defendants does not necessarily mean that they are in the clear. Legal experts have said that the government could appeal and try to reinstate the charges. Prosecutors accused the defendants of helping cheat the federal government out of $2.5 billion by setting up questionable tax shelters for wealthy clients. A trial is set for September after earlier delays. KPMG -- in conjunction with a $456 million settlement agreement that allowed it to avoid its own indictment -- had withheld payment of legal fees of its former partners. Kaplan said that prosecutors unconstitutionally pressured KPMG into not paying their legal fees and dismissing charges was the only way to remedy that. "The court has reached this conclusion only after pursuing every alternative short of dismissal and only with the greatest reluctance," Kaplan wrote in the ruling. He said that while he respects the office of the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan, "there are limits on the permissible actions of even the best prosecutors." Kaplan ruled last year that the government had violated the defendants' rights to fair trial and assistance of counsel under the fifth and sixth amendments to the U.S. Constitution by pressuring KPMG to withhold the legal fees. Earlier this year, the judge had asked lawyers in the case what options other than dismissal of the entire indictment were available. He also had asked them what steps the government could take to remedy the constitutional violations. The defendants renewed their motion to dismiss the charges against them last month, and prosecutors conceded that throwing out charges against most of the former partners was the only remedy to the violations in light of Kaplan's ruling.
