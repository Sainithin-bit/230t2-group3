 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Mattel Inc. MAT.N, the largest U.S. toy maker, reported higher second-quarter profit on Monday on the strength of its Barbie and Wheels lines and expressed optimism about the second half of the year, sending its shares up more than 3 percent. 

 Overseas sales were higher during the quarter, offsetting a decline in the United States. Net income rose to $43.1 million, or 11 cents a share, 1 cent higher than analysts' average forecast, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 6.5 percent to $1.02 billion, meeting analysts' expectations. A rise of 18 percent overseas offset a 3 percent decline in the United States. Sales of Mattel's girls and boys brands rose 5 percent, while Fisher Price sales increased 12 percent. The company's Wheels business, which includes Hot Wheels and Matchbox toy cars, increased 20 percent. Worldwide sales of its 48-year-old Barbie line rose 6 percent as strong sales abroad overcame a 5 percent decline in the United States, where the dolls face competition from MGA Entertainment's Bratz dolls and Hasbro's HAS.N Littlest Pet Shop. Analysts warned that lower domestic Barbie sales were a concern. "Though this was an in-line quarter from an EPS perspective, we would expect the Street to be critical of the domestic Barbie declines," Lehman Brothers analyst Felicia Hendrix wrote in a research note. Mattel Chief Executive Robert Eckert said on a conference call that he believed the company's all-important second-half sales, including the holiday season, are poised for a positive year. "It is a big pile of goods that has to be sold for Christmas, so the anxiety meter seasonally is about as high as it gets right now, and I haven't felt or heard anything that makes me have more anxiety than normal," Eckert said. "That's a good sign. Generally speaking I feel good about the business." Investors are focused on a number of product launches in the second half of the year aimed at boosting sales. For example, Mattel later this month is introducing Barbie Girls, a doll-shaped digital music player that turns into a live character at Barbiegirls.com. The company is also betting on strong demand for the Fisher-Price "Smart Cycle," a stationary bike that connects to a television and teaches children letters, numbers and shapes. Mattel is also gearing up for a strong year for movie tie-in's in 2008. The company signed a licensing deal to make toys based on characters from the next chapter in Warner Brothers' "Batman" franchise, "The Dark Knight." It was also tapped to make toys tied into "Speed Racer," the latest film by Larry and Andy Wachowski in their first directorial outing since completing the "Matrix" trilogy in 2003. Shares of Mattel were up 90 cents at $27.43 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. (Additional reporting by  Martinne Geller  and  Justin Grant )
