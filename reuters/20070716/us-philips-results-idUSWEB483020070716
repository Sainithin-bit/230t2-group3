 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - Philips Electronics, Europe's biggest consumer electronics maker, posted a 22-percent rise in second-quarter operating profit on Monday thanks to an improved performance at its domestic appliances unit and lower overheads. 

 Philips reported earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of 302 million euros ($416 million), slightly short of an average forecast of 308 million given in a Reuters poll, as some key units such as consumer electronics and lighting disappointed. Philips' domestic appliances unit, which makes shavers, electric toothbrushes and coffee machines, showed 14 percent comparable sales growth and boosted its profitability. Overall corporate expenses fell, partly due to higher spending last year for the soccer World Cup. Philips' consumer electronics business -- which represented 27 percent of sales but just 7 percent of operating profit in the second quarter -- saw sales decline by 11 percent from last year, when the unit benefited from the soccer World Cup. Its consumer electronics business includes televisions, DVD players and music systems. Sales fell to 6.1 billion euros from 6.38 billion a year ago. Excluding currency effects and disposals and acquisitions, revenue was flat. By 0840 GMT, Philips shares were down 0.6 percent to 32.33 euros, underperforming a 0.4-percent rise in the DJ Stoxx 50 index. SNS Securities analyst Victor Bareno said that while overall results had been in line with expectations, that was mostly due to lower corporate overhead costs, and positive surprises were scarce. "If you look at the core activities -- medical, lighting -- it was slightly below our estimates. Consumer electronics ... was a disappointment, the 11-percent decline in revenues was worse than expected," Bareno said. Philips said it was on track to meet its targets of 5 to 6-percent average annual sales growth and a profit margin at the level of earnings before interest, tax and amortization (EBITA) of at least 7.5 percent in 2007. The second-quarter EBITA margin was 6.4 percent. "We knew the June quarter was a tough one, and it was perhaps even a bit tougher than expected ... However, all ingredients for a strong second half are there," ING analysts said in a note. The group's net profit, which rose to 1.57 billion euros from 301 million last year, was boosted by a 1.22 billion-euro gain on selling shares in Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC ( 2330.TW ). Philips' hospital-equipment business, singled out by analysts for lackluster growth in the first quarter, showed comparable sales growth of 4 percent in the second quarter, while order intake grew 12 percent. The unit's core earnings rose 3.8 percent, contrasting with poor quarterly results from General Electric ( GE.N ), a direct competitor in hospital imaging tools such as MRI scanners and X-ray machines. GE said last week that profits at its health care unit fell 8 percent in the second quarter, blaming regulatory changes. CASH PILE Philips' cash pile rose to 6.3 billion euros at the end of June, up from 5.9 billion three months earlier, boosted by the TSMC stake sale. The company is running a 1.6 billion-euro share buyback program, and Chief Executive Gerard Kleisterlee said in a statement it had a good acquisition pipeline. But Chief Financial Officer Pierre-Jean Sivignon acknowledged that medical companies -- where Philips sees significant growth potential -- had become expensive. "It is true that multiples in medical are high. You have to be very, very opportunistic and very specific," he told CNBC. Philips has all but completed a shift to more stable and higher-margin businesses with the sale last year of a majority stake in its semiconductor unit, now named NXP NXP.UL. Its shares have risen almost 25 percent since it announced the sale last August, but still trade below the sector average. Sivignon told a conference call Philips also aimed to cut its stake in flat-panel venture LG.Philips LCD to below 20 percent this year from currently about 33 percent. Kempen analyst Jan Willem Berghuis said that corrected for cash and stakes in listed companies, Philips traded at around 13 times estimated 2008 earnings, compared with a market average of 14 to 15. Of 37 analysts tracked by Reuters Estimates, 26 rate Philips shares "buy" or "outperform", while nine have a "hold" rating. Just two analysts recommend selling the shares.
