 SEOUL  (Reuters) - Asian stocks edged higher on Monday following a strong performance by Wall Street last week, but Seoul shares eased from a record high as Kookmin Bank dropped after being ordered to pay back taxes. 

 With Japan' financial markets closed for a public holiday, Asian markets are focused on earnings results on Monday, including from South Korean steel maker POSCO Co. Ltd. ( 005490.KS ) and Indian software services exporter Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. ( TCS.BO ). In Hong Kong, conglomerate Fosun International Ltd. ( 0656.HK ) is set to make its market debut after raising about $1.5 billion earlier this month in an initial public offering. "Global markets continue to perform strongly, setting up the stage for more gains," said Kim Hak-kyun, an analyst at Korea Investment and Securities. Asian markets have rallied with the MSCI measure of Asia Pacific stocks excluding Japan .MSCIAPJ hitting its latest intraday record in early Monday trade. But some analysts also expressed caution about the recent pace of gains in the region. "The broader influences on investment fundamentals remain mixed as bond yields continue to climb overall, the price of oil continues to rally," said Guy Hutchings, chief investment officer at MFS Investment Management Ltd. "And investors appear resigned to the prospect that we have not seen the worst of the fallout from losses related to the subprime loan market," he added. Australia's benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index .AXJO rose 0.26 percent to 6,406.3 by 0043 GMT, approaching a record hit on Friday. Seoul's main KOSPI  .KS11  rose 0.12 percent to 1,965.27 in a volatile morning that saw shares hit their eighth intraday record this month and then swing between gains and losses. Gains in the region on Monday were supported after data showing improving U.S. consumer sentiment sparked optimism about increased sales to the region's top export market, taking the sting out of a report showing a slump in U.S. retail sales. Wall Street capped a record-setting week, with the S&P 500  .SPX  surpassing levels reached during the Internet bubble. Banks led Australian shares higher with Commonwealth Bank of Australia Ltd. ( CBA.AX ) up 0.69 percent. But Rio Tinto Ltd. ( RIO.AX ) dropped 2.67 percent, falling for a second session, after it agreed last week to pay $38.1 billion for Canadian aluminum maker Alcan Inc. AL.TO In Seoul, POSCO ( 005490.KS ) rose 0.71 percent. The world's fourth-biggest steel maker is expected to report net profit in the second quarter surged 32.5 percent to 941 billion won ($1.03 billion) from a year earlier, thanks to higher steel prices. Shares in POSCO had surged 10 percent on Friday, partly on anticipation of the results, which are due after the close of local markets. <ID:nSHA31262> But Kookmin Bank 060000.KS dropped 3.22 percent after the country's biggest lender said on Friday it was ordered to pay some $482 million in back taxes over its accounting method for loan-loss provisions when it absorbed a credit card unit in 2003.
