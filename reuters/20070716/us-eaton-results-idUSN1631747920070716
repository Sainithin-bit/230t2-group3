 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Eaton Corp ( ETN.N ), a diversified manufacturer, posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings on Monday as sales growth from acquisitions offset weakness in its truck division. 

 Eaton, whose shares rose nearly 4 percent in premarket trading, said second-quarter operating earnings rose to $1.70 a share from $1.68 a year earlier. Analysts, on average, had forecast $1.47, according to Reuters Estimates. In April, Eaton, whose products range from electrical power distribution and control equipment to engine parts and hydraulic and fluid power systems, forecast operating earnings of $1.40 to $1.50 a share. The company said net income declined, due in part to charges related to the integration of acquisitions. Net profit fell to $246 million from $253 million a year earlier. Per-share earnings were unchanged at $1.64 as shares outstanding declined. Sales in the quarter rose to $3.25 billion from $3.13 billion a year earlier, although truck segment sales fell 23 percent. The company forecast third-quarter operating earnings of $1.60 to $1.70 a share. Wall Street expects $1.63. Eaton raised its full-year earnings forecast, excluding special items, to a range of $6.75 to $6.95 a share. In April it forecast $6.45 to $6.65 a share. "The year is shaping up to be in line with our initial forecast. We see slightly stronger growth in the electrical markets, offset by weaker-than-anticipated conditions in the North American hydraulics markets," Chief Executive Alexander Cutler said in a statement. Eaton shares rose to $101.80 in trading before the bell, up from a Friday close at $98.10 on the New York Stock Exchange. In April, Eaton said it expected sales in the industrial markets it serves to fall 3 percent to 4 percent. It cited the weak North American heavy-duty truck market. At that time, the Cleveland, Ohio-based company also said it expected the markets it serves to rebound next year to a 5 percent growth rate. (Reporting by  Euan Rocha )
