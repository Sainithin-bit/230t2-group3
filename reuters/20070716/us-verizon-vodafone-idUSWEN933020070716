 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wireless telecommunications company Vodafone Group Plc ( VOD.L ) has been considering a $160 billion takeover bid of Verizon Communications ( VZ.N ), the Financial Times reported on Monday on its Alphaville site. 

 Vodafone has not yet approached Verizon with the plan, and there's no certainty a bid will be pursued, FT Alphaville said, citing unnamed sources. Verizon shares rose 1.9 percent to $42.55 in premarket trading.
