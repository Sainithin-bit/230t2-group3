 BOSTON  (Reuters) - U.S. auto parts maker Lear Corp. ( LEA.N ) said on Monday its shareholders voted down a buyout offer from an affiliate of billionaire investor Carl Icahn, rejecting the board's recommendation. 

 The company said the offer from Icahn's American Real Estate Partners LP ( ACP.N ) was not supported by a majority of shareholders who voted at its annual meeting in Wilmington, Delaware. Lear's board of directors had recommended that shareholders approve the sweetened $3 billion, or $37.25 per share, offer from Icahn's firm. But it met opposition from influential advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services as well as Lear's second-biggest shareholder, Pzena Investment Management LLC, and the California State Teachers' Retirement System, which argued that it undervalued the company. "We respect the stockholder majority," Bob Rossiter, Lear chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. Pzena has argued Lear is worth $55 to $60 per share, while the California teachers system estimated it is worth $40 to $50 per share. "We're happy," said Rick Pzena, founder and co-chief investment officer of Pzena Investment Management LLC, which has $30 billion under management. "I hope the board now will stick to running the business and not engage in this kind of thing. Mostly we would love to see the management focus on getting the earnings up and letting the stock rise, because it will if they get the earnings up." Pzena said his firm, which generally doesn't take activist stances in its investments, hasn't decided whether to take action at next year's shareholder meeting, such as running a candidate for the board. He said his firm is still upset with the board over the $25 million breakup fee that is now owed to Icahn as a result of the shareholder vote. Icahn's office said he was out of town and unavailable. Shares of Southfield, Michigan-based Lear were up 11 cents at $37.01 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday afternoon. BREAKUP FEE Icahn, who first bid $36 a share for Lear in February, was due to receive a $25 million breakup fee in cash and Lear stock if shareholders rejected the offer. That could be upped to $85 million if Lear is sold to another bidder within a year. Lear, which makes automotive seats and electronics, had postponed the vote from June in an effort to drum up more support. The company has suffered in recent years, reflecting troubles at its major Detroit automaker customers -- General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ), Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) and the Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler AG DCXGn.DE. Lear's shares have run up about 50 percent in value since October, when it disclosed that Icahn would take a $200 million stake in the company. Over that period, the Dow Jones U.S. auto parts index .DJUSAP has risen about 25 percent in value. (Additional reporting by  Dane Hamilton  in New York)
