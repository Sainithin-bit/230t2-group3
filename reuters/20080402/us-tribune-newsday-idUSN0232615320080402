 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Jared Kushner, owner of the weekly New York Observer, is among those considering buying or entering a partnership with Newsday, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday, citing a source familiar with the matter. 

 Kushner would join a group of potential suitors for the Long Island daily that includes Rupert Murdoch's News Corp NWSa.N, which owns the New York Post and Wall Street Journal, plus New York Daily News owner Mortimer Zuckerman and Cablevision Systems Corp ( CVC.N ), the Journal said, citing people familiar with the matter. Newsday is owned by debt-laden Tribune Co, which posted a $78.8 million fourth-quarter loss last month as advertising and circulation dropped at its newspapers. Tribune representatives could not immediately be reached for comment. Tribune, which went private in a buyout last year led by real estate tycoon Sam Zell, is hoping to sell Newsday for at least $500 million, sources told the Journal. One source told the Journal that News Corp had discussed creating a joint venture with Tribune to own Newsday and the Post. News Corp representatives were not immediately available for comment.
