 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Retailer Best Buy Co ( BBY.N ) said it expects slower growth in the television industry this year with the softer U.S. economy. 

 "We agree with the industry consensus that the television industry will grow a little bit slower" this year, said Mike Vitelli, Best Buy senior vice president for home solutions, during a conference call. Flat-panel TVs demand is continuing to grow while the tube business is "almost gone," he added. The retailer also said during its conference call that it expects to expand the Best Buy Mobile service to the majority of its U.S. stores over the next 18 months. Currently, the retailer operates about 181 Best Buy Mobile cellphone stores within a store. (Reporting by  Karen Jacobs , editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
