 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - National City Corp NCC.N is in talks to sell itself to Cleveland rival KeyCorp ( KEY.N ), according to a media report, but a prolonged search for buyers has added to fears that it might not fetch even its current, depressed share price. 

 Shares of the ninth-largest U.S. bank fell on Wednesday, which is unusual because talk of a possible sale often lifts a company's share price dramatically. Media reports have said for weeks that National City was looking to sell itself, under the strain of mounting mortgage losses, exposure to the hard-hit Ohio and Michigan real estate markets, and a badly timed foray into Florida. On Tuesday, the bank said it was exploring strategic alternatives, which often indicates a sale is coming. But it could also signal that buyers are few and far between, said Adam Compton, co-head of global financial stock research at RCM Global Investors in San Francisco. "They've actually announced they're exploring strategic alternatives," Compton said. "That's the headline you never want to see, because the deal should have been done already." National City shares have lost about three-fourths of their value in the last year, and yet the bank may not get a premium over its current share price in a takeover, Compton added. SHORING UP CAPITAL The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday that KeyCorp might buy its larger rival. National City is looking at a number of options, but a deal with KeyCorp could win a capital infusion from private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co KKR.UL, sources told the newspaper. KKR and the two banks declined to comment. The housing downturn, particularly brutal in National City's primary markets in Ohio and Michigan, has forced the bank to boost credit reserves and write down bad loans. National City lost $333 million in the fourth quarter. In January, the bank sold more than $2 billion of securities, including $1.4 billion of convertible notes. That new capital helps, but it may not be enough. National City spent $2.1 billion buying two Florida banks in 2006 and 2007, hoping to win affluent customers along the state's eastern coast. Despite selling its First Franklin Financial Corp subprime lending unit to Merrill Lynch & Co MER.N in 2006, National City held on to several billion dollars of nonprime mortgages, intending to work them off its balance sheet over time. Bad credit markets intervened. By the end of 2007, the bank still held $6 billion of nonprime mortgages, equal to nearly half its shareholder equity. The bank's shares trade at less than half their book value, signaling investors expect big write-downs. National City said on Tuesday that Goldman Sachs, retained as a capital-raising adviser in early January, would now act as its strategic adviser. CUTTING COSTS A KeyCorp deal would lead to plenty of overlap and big potential cost savings, a major selling point, analysts said. One fund manager who requested anonymity said any deal could generate $1.5 billion of annual cost savings. For that reason, a merger between the two Cleveland banks has been seen as a possibility for more than a decade among investors eager for more U.S. regional banks to consolidate. KeyCorp can now gain market share either by buying National City at a low price, or by winning customers from its ailing rival, said Charles Peabody of independent research firm Portales Partners. Peabody raised his rating on KeyCorp to "buy" from "hold" on Wednesday. Private equity firms such as KKR are generally looking at investing in regional banks because of their low-cost deposits and unusually low stock prices, the Wall Street Journal said. National City has been considering some sort of business combination for months. In September Chief Executive Peter Raskind said at an analysts' conference that National City believed it would need to be "materially larger" to remain competitive over the next several years. "We may find that we need to think a little differently about M&A going forward in order to address the scale issue," Raskind said. National City stock fell 50 cents to $9.49 in late trading, while KeyCorp rose 77 cents, or 3.3 percent, to $24.26.
