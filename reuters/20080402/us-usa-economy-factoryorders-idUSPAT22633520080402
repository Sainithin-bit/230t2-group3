 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - New orders to U.S. factories for manufactured goods will likely post their second straight monthly drop in February, providing further evidence of a flagging industrial sector, according to a Reuters poll. 

 The median forecast of 58 economists showed February orders falling 0.8 percent after a 2.5 percent January fall. Forecasts ranged from a 2.7 percent decline to an 0.8 percent rise. Analysts polled expect the key durable goods component, which measures demand for long-lasting goods like new cars and refrigerators, to post a 1.7 percent February fall unrevised from the 1.7 percent decline originally reported last week. The Commerce Department issued the durable goods report for February on March 26. Manufacturing had been helping to offset weakness in the housing sector, but back-to-back declines -- in concert with other gloomy economic information -- would help set the stage for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates further. The central bank's policy-setting committee meets from April 29-30. Investors expect it to cut rates by another half a percentage point. That would come on top of the three percentage points that it has already lowered its benchmark overnight funds rate since mid-September to head off a recession. The rate now stands at 2.25 percent. The Commerce Department is scheduled to release the report at 10 a.m. (1400 GMT) on Wednesday. Here is a selection of comments from economists: Lehman Brothers Forecast: Factory orders -1.0 pct "Factory orders likely slipped 1.0 percent in February, based on an already reported 1.7 percent decline in the durable goods component and an expected contraction of 0.3 percent in nondurable goods orders. We look for nondurable inventories to decline by 0.2 percent during the month, largely as a payback from their 2.3 percent surge in January." IdealGlobal Forecast: Factory orders -0.9 pct "The sharp 1.7 percent decline in durable good orders for the month of February is a pretty solid indicator of the grim picture in the industrial sector. We expect that a second consecutive month of weak orders in the defense sector, a record decline in orders for machinery and a month of acute declines in orders in the computers and electronics sector will put quite the dent in the factory orders series for the month." 4CAST Forecast: Factory orders -0.9 pct "We expect February factory goods orders to fall by 0.9 percent. The fall should, however, be a more convincing signal for underlying weakness, with a 1.2 percent fall in ex-transportation likely to be the steepest since August and a 1.6 percent fall ex-transportation and petroleum set to be the steepest in 13 months."
