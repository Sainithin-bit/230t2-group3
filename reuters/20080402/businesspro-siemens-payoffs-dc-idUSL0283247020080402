 MUNICH  (Reuters) - German prosecutors are investigating 
whether engineering group Siemens AG ( SIEGn.DE ) paid millions 
of dollars in hush money to cover up bribes it used to win 
business contracts, a newspaper reported. 

  Several suspects have made this allegation to 
investigators, the Sueddeutsche Zeitung said on Wednesday 
without giving a source for its information.  "We are checking whether criminally relevant facts exist," 
a spokesman for the Munich prosecutor's office said in response 
to the report, declining to elaborate.  A Siemens spokesman said he could not discuss a case that 
is still under investigation.  The paper said the group paid consultants sums of up to 18 
million marks - the case dates from before the introduction of 
the euro - and then added more money later to buy their silence 
over extensive bribes. At times payments flowed as a result of 
threats to go public with the information.  If true, the allegations are more bad news for Siemens, 
which has acknowledged making 1.3 billion euros ($2.03 billion) 
in dubious payments from 1999 to 2006. A German court has 
already fined it 201 million euros in the case.  The scandal has cost Siemens 1.6 billion euros in all so 
far in fines, writedowns and legal fees.  Siemens also faces drastic sanctions from the U.S. 
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which could go as far 
as banning Siemens from bidding for U.S. contracts.  Chairman Gerhard Cromme is seeking a settlement in 
discussions with the SEC.  "We are in the process of entering talks" with the U.S. 
regulator, a company spokesman said.  (Reporting by Jens Hack; Editing by Paul Bolding)
