 HELSINKI  (Reuters) - Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ), the world's top handset maker, unveiled four new phone models on Wednesday, targeting consumers in emerging markets who are about to replace their first phones. 

 Nokia unveiled an entry-level multimedia phone Nokia 5000, which it plans to start selling this quarter for around 90 euros ($141), excluding taxes and subsidies. This quarter it would also start to sell its cheapest cameraphone, Nokia 1680 Classic, which would retail for 50 euros, when excluding taxes and subsidies. The Finnish handset maker said Nokia 2680, with a sliding design and priced at 75 euros, and Nokia 7070 Prism, priced at 50 euros, would both go on sale in the third quarter. Nokia, which makes four out of every 10 phones sold globally, has a dominant position in emerging markets and in cheaper models. In Africa and the Middle East, its market share was 67 percent in the fourth quarter, according to Strategy Analytics. "To keep the very strong leadership position in the emerging markets we have, we need to give consumers more choice -- be it on design, be it on features, and in the future on services as well," said Alex Lambeek, head of emerging markets business at Nokia's entry unit.
