 LONDON  (Reuters) - U.S. private equity group Blackstone ( BX.N ), which last year walked away from bid talks with FKI FKI.L, has hired bankers to examine making a counter bid for the engineering group, the Sunday Telegraph reported. 

 Blackstone has recruited Credit Suisse to evaluate an offer for FKI after rival bidder Melrose Plc NYN.L raised its cash-and-shares bid proposal to 500 million pounds ($1 billion), worth some 82.1 pence a FKI share, which came after a 70p initial approach from Melrose in early February. FKI and Blackstone were not immediately available to comment.
