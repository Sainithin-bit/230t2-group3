 DETROIT  (Reuters) - A top economist at General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) said on Tuesday it was quite possible that U.S. auto sales will decline in 2008 due to the weakness in the housing market and slower U.S. economic growth. 

 "There is a pretty significant risk that (the auto industry) will have a down year," GM's Ted Chu said at an event sponsored by the Society of Automotive Analysts on the sidelines of the North American Auto Show in Detroit. Chu is the lead economist at GM's Global Market and Industry Analysis unit. (Reporting by  Nick Carey , editing by John Wallace)
