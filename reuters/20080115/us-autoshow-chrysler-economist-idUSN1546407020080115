 DETROIT  (Reuters) - A top economist at Chrysler LLC said on Tuesday that the automaker expects industry sales in the United States probably won't be as high in 2008 as they were in 2007. 

 Paul Traub, a senior manager for economics and industry analysis at Chrysler, made the comments at an event sponsored by the Society of Automotive Analysts on the sidelines of the North American International Auto Show.
