 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) said on Monday it would begin selling its new Edge crossover SUV in Brazil later this year. 

 Ford sold 130,125 Edges in 2007, the vehicle's first full year of sales in the United States. South America is a fast-growing market for the No. 2 U.S. automaker. Its sales there rose 18 percent in 2007, led by a 20.7 percent rise in Brazil. "Ford is on a roll in South America, and our plan is to use our global product strengths to accelerate the introduction of more products that people really want and value around the world," Mark Fields, Ford's North American president, said in a statement.
