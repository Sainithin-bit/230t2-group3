 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices dipped unexpectedly by 0.1 percent in December after a sharp drop in fuel prices, government data showed on Tuesday, but core producer inflation rose by 0.2 percent as projected. 

 Economists polled by Reuters forecast that producer prices -- a gauge of the prices paid at the farm and factory gate -- would increase 0.2 percent last month from a 3.2 percent jump in November. Compared with December 2006, overall producer prices have risen 6.3 percent, which was the largest increase since a 7.1 percent advance in 1981, the Labor Department said. Gasoline prices dropped by 4.8 percent in December, but are up 37.1 percent on a 12 month basis. Finished energy goods declined by 1.9 percent. Core producer prices, which strip out food and energy, were held down by a drop in the cost of passenger cars and light trucks. Excluding these items, core producer prices were up 0.3 percent, a Labor Department official said. Soaring energy costs have buoyed producer prices and spilled into broader measures of consumer inflation in a worrying fashion for the Federal Reserve. December's consumer price index will be reported on Wednesday and is expected to show a 0.2 percent monthly gain. However, the U.S. central bank is expected to slash borrowing costs by a further half percentage point at its next meeting, on January 29-30, to protect the slowing economy from tipping into recession.
