 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Apple Inc Chief Executive Steve Jobs on Tuesday introduced a new version of the company's Apple TV product aimed at making it easier to watch movies delivered over the Internet. 

 "We've all tried how to get movies over the Internet onto a wide-screen TV, and you know what -- we've all missed. No one has succeeded yet," he said, as he rolled out the new version, which will support high-definition movies and work with a new movie rental service.
