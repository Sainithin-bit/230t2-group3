 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Hedge fund manager John Paulson, who earned billions of dollars last year by betting against the housing market, said on Tuesday that former Federal Reserve board chairman Alan Greenspan will advise his firm. 

 Greenspan, whose words can still move financial markets, will advise Paulson on the global economy for an undisclosed amount of money, the hedge fund said in a statement. By joining the New York-based fund, Greenspan becomes the latest former Washington insider to work in the fast growing $2 trillion hedge fund industry. Former Treasury Secretaries Lawrence Summers and John Snow provide advice to D.E. Shaw and Cerberus. (Reporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss; Editing by  Derek Caney )
