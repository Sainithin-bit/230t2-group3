 NEWCASTLE  (Reuters) - Embattled mortgage bank Northern Rock NRK.L faces a crucial shareholder meeting on Tuesday that could restrict its ability to sell assets and issue shares as possible nationalization looms. 

 Two of the lender's biggest shareholders have urged investors to support their proposals to give shareholders more power, hoping to ensure they get a fair price for their holdings under rescue plans being considered. Amid growing expectations that Britain's fifth-largest mortgage lender will be brought under state control, hundreds of small investors are set to attend Tuesday's meeting in the bank's home town of Newcastle, in northeast England. They own about a quarter of shares in issue so could swing the votes. The meeting -- at which investors will also vote on key board members including the bank's chairman and chief executive -- represents the highest profile stage for shareholders to voice their anger, frustration or support for the bank since a crisis erupted four months ago. Northern Rock's volatile shares were again weak on Tuesday after hitting a record closing low on Monday on speculation of imminent state control that would leave shareholders with little or nothing. At 3:43 a.m. EST, the shares were down almost 11 percent changing hands at 73.8p, also hit by reports that a decision on the bank's future may not be imminent. The Financial Times reported government officials had dismissed speculation that Prime Minister Gordon Brown would make a decision before leaving for China later this week. "There is no doubting that a combination of the government's prevarication, its poor advice and its lack commercial prowess that has left Northern Rock standing on the cliff of the abyss," David Buik of Cantor Index said. ON THE ABYSS? Northern Rock was one of the country's fastest growing lenders but it was brought to its knees in September when it was unable to raise funds in financial markets and had to turn to the Bank of England for emergency support. To prepare for the possibility that the bank will be put under state control, the government has lined up veteran executive Ron Sandler to run Northern Rock. Some saw that news over the weekend as intended to put pressure on shareholders to back the board in its showdown with hedge funds. The bank's 180,000 shareholders are considering the risk they could be left with nothing under a nationalization versus the option of holding out for a better takeover offer. Northern Rock has said it still wants a private sector solution and has been in talks with two consortiums led by Richard Branson's Virgin Group and investment firm Olivant. However, tough credit market conditions have made it difficult for them to raise billions of pounds needed to repay about 26 billion pounds in loans from the Bank of England. The government has said its priorities are to protect depositors and taxpayers. Proposals to limit the board's freedom to sell assets and issue shares have been put forward by hedge funds SRM and RAB Capital, which own a total of 18 percent stake in the bank. They say a hasty deal would destroy value. But Northern Rock has said the meeting is "potentially "damaging and urged shareholders to oppose the resolutions, saying they would "materially restrict the power of the board to act at a time when prompt, decisive action may be required". The Daily Telegraph said on Tuesday that the bank's chairman, Bryan Sanderson, contacted SRM and RAB to encourage them at least to support re-election of the board.
