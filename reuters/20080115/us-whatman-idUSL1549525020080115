 LONDON  (Reuters) - Four U.S. bidders including General Electric ( GE.N ) and Danaher ( DHR.N ) are vying to win control of British laboratory equipment company Whatman WHM.L, the Financial Times said on Tuesday. 

 The newspaper, without citing sources, said Parker Hannifin ( PH.N ) and Millipore ( MIL.N ) were also bidding for Whatman, which provides DNA technology to the police. Whatman has asked investment bank Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) to run the sale process and could chose a preferred suitor by the end of the month, the paper said. Neither Whatman nor Goldman could immediately be reached for comment. Whatman shares closed at 206 pence on Monday, valuing the business at about 249 million pounds ($488 million).
