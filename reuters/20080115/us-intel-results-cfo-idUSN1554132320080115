 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Intel Corp ( INTC.O ) did not see any signs of a U.S. recession in the holiday-sales-fueled fourth quarter but is somewhat cautious going into the first quarter, the chipmaker's CFO said on Tuesday. 

 "We did not see a slowdown over the course of the fourth quarter," Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith said in a phone interview. "We're a little bit cautious based on what we see in the U.S. economy." Smith also noted the United States accounts for less than 25 percent of Intel's overall revenue. "We're not seeing signs of economic recession," Smith said. (Reporting by  Duncan Martell ; Editing by  Braden Reddall )
