 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan 
Greenspan is set to join hedge-fund firm Paulson & Co. as an 
adviser, The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday. 

  New York-based Paulson, with assets of $28 billion, is set 
to make the announcement on Tuesday, the report said.  Greenspan has been criticized by some for keeping the 
trendsetting federal funds rate at a low 1 percent from June 
2003 through June 2004, which some say contributed to a housing 
bubble that is now bursting.  (Reporting by  Ritsuko Ando ; Editing by  Tomasz Janowski )
