 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. Bancorp ( USB.N ), the sixth-largest U.S. bank, on Tuesday said fourth-quarter profit fell 21 percent, hurt by losses from loans and money market mutual funds, and a legal settlement. 

 Net income for the Minneapolis-based company fell to $942 million, or 53 cents per share, from $1.19 billion, or 66 cents, a year earlier. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel; Editing by John Wallace)
