 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - General Motors Chief Executive Rick Wagoner has agreed to step down at the request of the Obama administration, a White House official said on Sunday. 

 The move comes a day before President Barack Obama is expected to outline new steps to help GM and Chrysler as part of an ongoing federal bailout of the companies.
