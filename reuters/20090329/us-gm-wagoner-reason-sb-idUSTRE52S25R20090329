 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp Chief Executive Rick Wagoner's decision to resign is related to the automaker's negotiations with U.S. officials over further federal aid to avoid bankruptcy, a person familiar with the matter said. 

 The person, who declined to be identified because the decision had not been made public yet, had earlier told Reuters that Wagoner was about to step down from the top job after more than eight years as head of the struggling automaker. Wagoner came under fire for his stewardship of GM late last year when U.S. lawmakers debated a bailout for the automaker. He has repeatedly said that he intended to stay on, and GM's board has offered unanimous support for him. GM declined comment.
