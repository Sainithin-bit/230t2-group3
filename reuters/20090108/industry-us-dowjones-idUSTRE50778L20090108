 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - News Corp's Dow Jones & Co, which owns The Wall Street Journal, plans to freeze employee salaries because of the prolonged economic downturn, according to a memo sent to workers on Thursday. 

 The memo, sent by Dow Jones Chief Executive Les Hinton and obtained by Reuters, said the one-year freeze is part of efforts to look for ways to save money. It does not cover staff working under union agreements, but the company is seeking an equivalent freeze for those employees. The freeze would help mitigate future possible job cuts, he wrote. The memo was first reported on MediaBistro.com's FishbowlDC blog. Dow Jones Newswires and Reuters compete in providing news and financial information.
