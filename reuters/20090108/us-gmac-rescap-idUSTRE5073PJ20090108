 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Finance company GMAC LLC expressed support for its money-losing Residential Capital LLC mortgage unit on Thursday but stopped short of a commitment to keep the big home loan provider in business. 

 Responding in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing to "various questions," GMAC said ResCap is an important subsidiary and that it has better aligned the unit with current market conditions. "If ResCap were to need additional support, GMAC would provide that support so long as it was in the best interests of GMAC stakeholders," GMAC said. "While there can be no assurances, GMAC's recently approved status as a regulated bank holding company has increased the importance of its support for ResCap." ResCap debt rose in price and the cost of insuring the debt fell, indicating that investors see less risk of default. GMAC's largest investors include General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) and private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management LP CBS.UL. GMAC is the main lender to GM customers. In December, GMAC received a $6 billion government infusion and conducted a $21.2 billion debt swap designed to bolster its capital. It also won bank holding company status from the U.S. Federal Reserve, allowing it to tap lower-cost funding. The future of ResCap, one of the 10 largest U.S. home loan providers, has been in question after a surge in bad loans led to big losses and forced it to tighten lending standards. GMAC said ResCap lost $9.1 billion in the two years ended September 30, 2008, and has reduced its workforce to about 3,800 from 14,000 two years ago. ResCap has been the major drag on GMAC's results, and its losses led to questions about the future of GMAC itself. "There have been some issues raised in the markets as to how ResCap fits in with the GMAC organization in light of the recent news," GMAC spokeswoman Gina Proia said. "We wanted to clarify and be very clear in a broad disclosure that ResCap is an important subsidiary." GMAC is based in Detroit, and ResCap in Minneapolis. In morning trading, the cost to insure $10 million of ResCap debt against default for five years fell to $3.62 million upfront plus $500,000 a year, from $4.72 million percent upfront plus $500,000 a year, according to Markit. ResCap's "distressed" 8.375 percent notes maturing in June 2010 rose 0.9 cent on the dollar to 49.9 cents, according to the bond pricing service Trace.
