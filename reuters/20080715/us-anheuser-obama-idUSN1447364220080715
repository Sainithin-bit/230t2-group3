 CINCINNATI  (Reuters) - Presumptive Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama said on Monday he was disappointed that Anheuser-Busch Cos Inc ( BUD.N ) agreed to its sale to Belgium-based InBev NV INTB.BR. 

 The Illinois senator said there was no law that could or should prevent the sale but more should have been done to try to attract an American buyer. "I was disappointed to learn that Anheuser-Busch has agreed to be sold to InBev. Anheuser-Busch is an American icon and this sale could threaten thousands of jobs in Missouri," Obama said in a statement. "While we cannot and should not pass a law to prevent this kind of sale, we could have and should have done everything possible to find an American buyer and create jobs at home," Obama said. "That means laying the right conditions for a stronger American economy." (Reporting by  Caren Bohan ; editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)
