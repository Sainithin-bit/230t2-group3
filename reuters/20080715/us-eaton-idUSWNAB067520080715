 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Diversified manufacturer Eaton Corp ( ETN.N ) reported higher quarterly profit on Tuesday on strength in its electrical and hydraulic segments, but said the balance of the year will be weaker than it had predicted earlier. 

 Net earnings for the second quarter rose 35 percent to $333 million, or $2.03 per share, compared with $246 million, or $1.64 per share, a year earlier. Earnings before acquisition-related charges were $2.10 per share. Analysts, on average, had expected profit of $1.94 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 32 percent to $4.28 billion, compared with Wall Street forecasts for sales of $4.16 billion. Acquisitions accounted for 19 percentage points of the sales growth, Eaton said. Cleveland-based Eaton, which serves the auto and truck makers among other industries, also cut its full-year forecast, saying its end-markets will have weaker growth than it had earlier expected, largely because of the impact of high oil prices. Eaton said it now expects full-year earnings per share from operations of $7.70 to $8, reducing the midpoint of its range by 20 cents per share. That straddles average analyst forecasts of $7.85 per share. (Reporting by Nick Zieminski; Editing by  Derek Caney  and Gerald E. McCormick)
