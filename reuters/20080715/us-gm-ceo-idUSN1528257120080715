 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp Chief Executive Rick Wagoner said on Tuesday new restructuring actions announced by the automaker will provide it with ample liquidity through 2009. 

 Wagoner said GM has a "solid, well thought out plan" to return its operations to profitability. It's "not a plan to survive, but a plan to win," he said in a broadcast to employees. GM said it would cut white-collar employment costs by 20 percent, sell up to $4 billion of assets and borrow at least $2 billion in a bid to bolster liquidity by $15 billion through 2009.
