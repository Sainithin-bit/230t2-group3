 FARNBOROUGH  (Reuters) - Farnborough Airshow has started more quietly than past events as record high fuel prices, tight credit and slowing economies have squeezed airlines and hurt ticket demand. 

 Following are orders that have been announced so far: TUESDAY: ** Tunisair said it had signed a firm contract for three Airbus ( EAD.PA ) A350-800s, three A330-200s and 10 A320s, in a deal worth about $1.94 billion at list prices. ** Nigerian airline Arik ordered seven Boeing ( BA.N ) 737 single-aisle jets and said it intended to purchase four 747-8 airliners. ** Qatar Airways said it had signed a memorandum of understanding for six Airbus A321 aircraft, made up of four firm orders and two options. The Gulf airline also said it was still interested in Bombardier's ( BBDb.TO ) CSeries, and hoped to announce a further Airbus A320-family order soon. MONDAY: ** Etihad said it was buying 25 Airbus wide-body A350 aircraft, 10 A380 superjumbos and 20 single-aisle A320 planes in a transaction worth $11 billion at list prices. Etihad also ordered 35 Boeing 787 Dreamliners and 10 Boeing 777s, in a deal Boeing said was worth $9.4 billion. ** Boeing said FlyDubai ordered 50 single-aisle 737 airliners, in a deal worth $4 billion at list prices.
