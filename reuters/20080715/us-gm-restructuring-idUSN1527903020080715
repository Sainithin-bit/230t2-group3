 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp on Tuesday said it would cut salaried employment costs by 20 percent, sell up to $4 billion in assets and borrow at least $2 billion in a bid to bolster its liquidity by $15 billion through 2009. 

 The following are market comments about the company's plans. MIRKO MIKELIC, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, FIFTH THIRD ASSET MANAGEMENT,  GRAND RAPIDS, MICHIGAN: "They are just trying to be safe rather than sorry. It's probably easier to raise money right now for them as opposed to waiting until the last minute in a year or two. "They have way too many name plates. There is a whole series of things they really need to do to cut costs and these are things it would have been easier to do in 2000. "Now they are reacting to events and things are really coming to a head. Right now auto sales are at recession levels. "There are a lot easier CEO positions than dealing with all the issues they have. GM has so many problems to deal with, it is just an absolute nightmare. "They are right in the thick of all the issues in the United States. Throw in gas and energy prices on top of that and it is just very difficult to see anybody being successful in that position." ALAN LANCZ, PRESIDENT, ALAN B. LANCZ & ASSOCIATES, TOLEDO, OHIO "We've been negative on GM for several years, just didn't like their competitive situation, with their health care costs, etc. Actually, we're negative all U.S. automakers. "As far as this announcement, it reminds me of what the financial companies, the banks are doing. They don't have a choice. Cutting their dividend, it should have been done a year ago. Raising capital, it should have been done a year ago. "The banks made the same mistake. They didn't take subprime and the credit crisis and real estate bubble to heart, and now when they're finally realizing the affects of it, they're raising capital at the worst time. Unfortunately, you can put GM with that same scenario. "It's not a surprise they're emphasizing a lot of product that is not the most efficient energy-wise. "This extends and broadens the credit crisis. Where we thought a year ago we warned about the excess values in real estate and some of the financials ... they're running into the same malaise from a standpoint of being noncompetitive and not making the changes." TIM GHRISKEY, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, SOLARIS ASSET MANAGEMENT, NEW YORK "It will boost the liquidity of the company significantly and certainly allows GM to at least survive for several more years in a tough environment for automotive sales. "The liquidity worries will still be out there several years from now if the environment doesn't improve. "Yes, for now this solves GM's liquidity issues, but we have to see better demand for automobiles, for cars and trucks, in order for the liquidity crisis to be put to bed. "They're burning through about $3 billion in cash a quarter. The cash drain has to stop at some point or GM has larger problems. "This doesn't improve or fix the issues of market share loss or overall automotive demand." "There are too many automotive nameplates out there and too many brands at GM. Rationalizing that product lineup should help them. "I don't think the environment is his doing," he said of Wagoner. "This is a very tough demand environment and I do think he is reacting quickly to it. "Is he the right person for the job? I've got no idea. Is there a better person for the job? I've got no idea. "They've done all they can do. A 20-percent white-collar job reduction is not insignificant at all. "It really does seem like he has dealt with numerous issues here and set up this company to at least survive if not potentially prosper in the environment ahead. He's hit a number of buttons and made a number of major changes." PETER MORICI, PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND SCHOOL OF BUSINESS "They're not selling enough vehicles and they're finally hitting the liquidity wall. General Motors is running out of cash and that's why it's looking for these concessions from the union and is seeking to raise more money. "They better start selling some cars at better prices soon or they're going to run out of this money. This is only going to last so long. This buys them a year or two, depending on how the market goes. "The reality is that General Motors is in a liquidation mode. "The issue really is can anyone lead this company now? I've said all along that Wagoner doesn't deserve the job. He doesn't deserve to lead the company. I don't know that anyone can right now. "I do know this. If I were leading the company, it would be a very sad day for (UAW President) Ron Gettelfinger because I would tell him, 'We have to have a new deal tomorrow morning at 9:00 or I'm going to restructure this company in such a way that I can take the manufacturing operations, which employ the union, through Chapter 11 and then we'll throw your contract right out the window. Now, do you want to sit down with me or me and the (bankruptcy) judge?'" "As it is, they're probably headed for Chapter 11 sooner or later." "What has Gettelfinger gotten his workers, but an empty promise. ANTHONY CONROY -- HEAD TRADER FOR BNY CONVERGEX, AN AFFILIATE OF THE BANK  OF NEW YORK, NY "The whole (auto) industry has been in a negative territory for some time. By cutting some of these things, the entire industry, not GM specifically, they're just trying to save as much cash as they can for the future. "As a sector, it's just so inexpensive right now I think we're coming close to the bottom of that sector." GEORGE MAGLIANO, ANALYST, GLOBAL INSIGHT "They are shoring up their cash position. But I don't think it is the end of the cuts, or the selling of some of the businesses. "You are probably going to see some more cuts."
