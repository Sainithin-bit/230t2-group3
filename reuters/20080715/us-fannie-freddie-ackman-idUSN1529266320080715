 BOSTON/NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Activist investor William Ackman said on Tuesday that battered mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are not well capitalized and their share prices could drop further. 

 Ackman proposed a restructuring of Fannie Mae that calls for the government to offer to buy its $750 billion in senior unsecured debt at 90 cents on the dollar, and give debt holders 10 cents of new common stock in the restructured company. The commitment of the U.S. government to purchase Fannie's debt would be on a stand-by basis for three years, he said. "The beauty of a three-year stand-by purchase commitment by the government is that no one will ever exercise it," he told cable television network CNBC. "If it's there, it's good." Ackman said Fannie Mae is leveraged 129 to 1 and warned that needs to be reduced dramatically. Its balance sheet, along with Freddie Mac's, must be bolstered before confidence in the two companies and financial markets can be restored, he said. "They are far from well capitalized," said Ackman. "These institutions need to be able to withstand the perfect storm. It is now the perfect storm." The two companies hold or own about $5.2 trillion in mortgages, or almost half of all mortgages in the United States. The shares of Fannie Mae and sibling Freddie Mac have cratered since last week over concerns that the companies need to raise more capital. The shares tumbled further on Tuesday over fears that the U.S. government rescue plan announced on Sunday would dilute the equity stakes of existing shareholders. In addition Tuesday, Moody's Investors Service cut the preferred stock and bank financial strength ratings of both and said it may cut them again. In late morning, Fannie Mae shares were down 25 percent at $7.32, and Freddie shares were off 26 percent at $5.28. Their stock has further to drop, said Ackman, who runs New York-based hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management, before the market opened. "They haven't reported second quarters yet. Wait until you see second-quarter earnings; they're going to be a disaster," he said. Ackman said $11 billion in Fannie Mae subordinated debt, $21 billion in preferred equity and $24 billion in common equity should be extinguished. Holders of the extinguished securities should be given $56 billion in new stock, according to a copy of his plan that he gave Reuters. He also said he has been trying to figure out how to save Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac because it is good for the long side of his portfolio and "because it is good for the country." "We want Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to be vibrant institutions that can write mortgages and help," he said. "Frankly, I think these institutions could be the event that stabilizes the economy."
