 BOSTON  (Reuters) - State Street Corp ( STT.N ), one of the world's biggest institutional money managers, said on Tuesday that second-quarter profit rose amid more demand for its services, which helped the company report record revenue. 

 State Street, which also earns fees for holding trillions of dollars in securities in custody and calculating the bulk of mutual fund prices printed in newspapers, said net income increased to $548 million, or $1.35 per diluted share, from $366 million, or $1.07 a share, a year earlier.
