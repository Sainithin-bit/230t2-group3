 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President George W. Bush on Tuesday said Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac must be able to continue providing access to credit and the mortgage lenders should remain owned by shareholders. 

 "We must ensure that they can continue providing access to mortgage credit during this time of financial stress," Bush said. He urged Congress to quickly pass housing legislation that includes reforms for the regulator of the two lenders. (Reporting by  Jeremy Pelofsky ; Editing by Theodore d'Afflisio)
