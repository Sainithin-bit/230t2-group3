 FARNBOROUGH  (Reuters) - Britain's Ministry of Defence (MoD) is to team up with industry partners on a new procurement strategy for missiles and guided weapons, to help fulfill urgent operational requirements. 

 "There are new and emerging threats and we need to focus on getting new solutions to front line as soon as possible. To do this we need to improve coherence across the program," Ann Taylor, Minister for Defence Equipment and Support, said. The MoD will team up with MBDA (UK), Thales UK ( TCFP.PA ), QinetiQ ( QQ.L ) and Roxel UK Ltd on the assessment phase, which is worth 74 million pounds ($148 million) in the first year for Team CW, Taylor told reporters on Tuesday. "Team CW (complex weapons) will help protect our operational sovereignty in this sector for the future," Taylor said. (Reporting by  Rhys Jones , Editing by Dan Lalor) ($1 = 0.5002 pound)
