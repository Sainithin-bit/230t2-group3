 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate John McCain's wife, Cindy, could benefit from Anheuser-Busch Cos Inc's ( BUD.N ) $52 billion takeover by Belgium-based InBev NV INTB.BR. 

 Cindy McCain, together with dependent children, earned $50,001-$100,000 in dividend income for 2007 from Anheuser-Busch shares, according to a Financial Disclosure Report filing on the Center for Responsive Politics' Web site. Anheuser-Busch paid $1.25 dividend in 2007 per share, according to company filings. That indicates that Cindy McCain, together with dependents, owned between 40,000 and 80,000 shares -- figures which were calculated by Reuters. At the offer price of $70 a share, those shares would be worth $2.8 million to $5.6 million. It was unclear how many shares Cindy McCain currently owns. An email to a spokesman for the McCain campaign was not immediately returned. Earlier, U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama said he was disappointed about the deal and that more should have been done to try to attract an American buyer.
