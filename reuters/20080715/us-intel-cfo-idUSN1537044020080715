 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Intel Corp is seeing healthy demand for its products going into the back half of 2008, the company's chief financial officer said on Tuesday. 

 "The demand signals we're seeing are pretty strong," said Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith in a telephone interview when asked about demand in the latter part of this year. He said the company's second-quarter results were at the high end of its typical seasonal range. "We forecasted a seasonal third quarter and I think that kind of says it all," Smith said, noting that inventory levels in the just-reported quarter were "pretty normal." He also said that shipments of mobile processors in the quarter for the first time topped 50 percent of all PC processors shipped in the quarter. "It's a pretty important milestone," Smith said.
