 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp Chief Operating Officer Fritz Henderson said on Tuesday the automaker would offer buyouts and early retirement incentives to white-collar employees to cut payroll costs. 

 GM said earlier it would cut white-collar employment costs by 20 percent, sell up to $4 billion of assets and borrow at least $2 billion in a bid to bolster liquidity by $15 billion through 2009. (Reporting by  Poornima Gupta ; editing by John Wallace)
