 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Genentech Inc DNA.N on Monday reported higher-than-expected quarterly sales of its most important product, the cancer drug Avastin, and raised its earnings outlook for the year. 

 Profit at the world's second-largest biotechnology company rose nearly 5 percent in the second quarter but fell short of Wall Street expectations due to higher costs. Still, Genentech's shares rose about 1 percent as Avastin sales rose 15 percent. "The numbers looked pretty good. The investor focus has been on the top line and on Avastin in particular and that number for the first time in several quarters edged ahead of consensus, so that's the most important thing," said Eric Schmidt of Cowen & Co. Genentech posted net income of $782 million, or 73 cents per share, compared with $747 million, or 70 cents per share, a year ago. Excluding items, the South San Francisco, California-based company earned 82 cents per share. Analysts on average expected 85 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Higher expenses, including $50 million for unusable product made at a Genentech manufacturing facility, led to the earnings miss. "They've got plenty of expense flexibility (which allows them to reduce expenses) so I'm not concerned that the bottom line fell a little bit short," Schmidt said. The company raised its estimate for full-year earnings to $3.40 to $3.50 per share, excluding items, from its prior forecast of $3.35 to $3.45 per share. Chief Financial Officer David Ebersman attributed the increase to "a lot of little things," including Avastin sales trends. Revenue for the quarter rose 8 percent to $3.24 billion, edging slightly above the $3.23 billion expected by Wall Street. U.S. sales of Avastin rose to $650 million for the quarter, beating the $643 million expected by analysts, as compiled by Rodman & Renshaw analyst Mike King. The drug, used for treating colon and lung cancers, won additional approval in late February as a treatment for breast cancer. "Avastin didn't blow out the high end but given the robust growth there, the robust growth in Rituxan and very solid support from Herceptin, Tarceva and Lucentis all added up to a very nice quarter," King said. Ian Clark, head of Genentech's commercial operations, said Avastin is now being used in about 35 percent of eligible breast cancer patients and 65 percent of eligible lung cancer patients. "We have more room for growth," he said. The company expects to file later this year for approval of Avastin as a treatment for brain cancer and kidney cancer. The drug is being studied in a range of cancer types and as a treatment for patients who have had their tumors surgically removed. Genentech's Sales of Rituxan for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and rheumatoid arthritis rose 12 percent to $651 million, also outstripping the $630 million expected by Wall Street. U.S. Sales of breast cancer drug Herceptin rose 3 percent to $338 million for the quarter, falling short of analyst expectations of $345 million. Net royalty revenue jumped 30 percent to $629 million, helped by favorable foreign exchange rates against the weak dollar. Roche Holding AG ( ROG.VX ), which owns a majority stake in Genentech and sells its drugs outside the United States, pays royalties in Swiss francs. Genentech, which has more than $7 billion in unrestricted cash and investments, said it has committed $500 million for a third-quarter share repurchase program, but has no plans to begin paying a dividend. "It doesn't seem like now is the right time," Ebersman said, adding that Genentech needs more data on Avastin and other programs before committing to a dividend. The company expects to have results from an interim analysis of the Avastin trial in post-surgery colon cancer patients by the end of this year. "We hope we will be able to treat patients and their cancer will never come back," said Susan Desmond-Hellmann, head of product development at Genentech. The company's shares, which fell 3 percent to close at $75.39 on the New York Stock Exchange, rose to $76.25 in after hours trading. Genentech shares are up about 13 percent this year, easily outperforming the American Stock Exchange Biotech Index .BTK, which has fallen about 4 percent over the same period.
