 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ.N ) posted second-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street expectations on strong demand for its medical devices, and the shares traded higher before the bell on Tuesday. 

  COMMENTS: JEFF JONAS, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, GABELLI HEALTHCARE AND  WELLNESS TRUST, OWNS J&J SHARES "They were great results. Revenue and earnings came in well above what we were looking for and what the Street was. The strength really came in the device and the consumer businesses." "The device business and the consumer were strong both domestically and internationally." "They're very aggressive buying back stock. They're buying back about 25 million shares a quarter...So that's helping them out on the earnings side too." "The pharmaceutical business is going to get weaker in the second half...so that's going to be more challenging. But if they can keep up the device and consumer momentum, they should be able to offset that." "I like where they're at now: Small tuck-in deals, buying back stock and controlling their expenses. They've got a good pipeline on the pharma side of things, and it does get better really in 2010." LINDA BANNISTER, ANALYST, EDWARD JONES "Overall, it was a pretty solid quarter for J&J, with a good beat versus earnings expectations despite a challenging environment for the company." "Cost savings and pharmaceutical sales were better than expected, which helped  results." (Reporting by Ransdell Pierson and  Lewis Krauskopf ; Compiled by Edward Tobin)
