 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. President George W. Bush urged motorists on Tuesday to conserve gasoline while automakers move to make their fleets more efficient, and said General Motors Corp and other mainstays of the U.S. economy should not expect a government bailout. 

 With Bush administration officials seeking congressional approval of a plan to offer an unlimited, temporary line of credit to mortgage giants Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, there was question on Tuesday whether the government should step in to help GM and other distressed companies -- like it did with smaller Chrysler in 1980. GM said earlier Tuesday it will intensify its already painful restructuring by cutting another $10 billion in costs, suspending its dividend and selling billions in assets to shore up cash and survive. As far as Bush is concerned, the old adage, "As General Motors goes, so goes the nation," is no longer a given. Bush was asked whether the automaker and companies in other distressed industries deserve some kind of temporary government assistance to support them. "Should the government bail out private enterprise? The answer is no, it shouldn't," Bush said, underscoring that he does not consider the Fannie/Freddie assistance package a bailout because the shareholders still own the company. Bush has previously advocated self-help for GM, Ford Motor Co and Chrysler LLC to reverse their slide, prompting strident criticism last year for failing to personally address their plight earlier in his presidency. His administration has offered financial help for research into new fuel technology but far less than the industry wants. Congress also has been slow to approve new tax and other incentives to help automakers retool their plants and invest in new technologies. Chief Executive Rick Wagoner described GM's latest announcement, which came two days after the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve offered the rescue package to Fannie and Freddie, as a necessary step to see the company through its downturn. "We need to take action ourselves," Wagoner said. Wagoner and his counterparts at Ford and Chrysler have said they would welcome government assistance on a range of issues that other business would embrace, too, but are not seeking a bailout. Bush says government should be an agent for change. "I think the government ought to create the conditions so that companies can survive," he said of GM's troubles. Bush touted last year's energy law that requires 40 percent auto fuel efficiency gains by 2020. He also urged Americans to conserve fuel but rejected any suggestion that he launch a national campaign to reduce energy use. "I think people ought to conserve and be wise about how they use gasoline and energy, absolutely," he said, stressing that consumers are "smart enough" to figure out how far they want to drive. As for the auto companies, Bush said they are "beginning to adjust here at home as consumer demand changes." GM's trials also reverberated on the presidential campaign trail. "When a mainstay of the American economy is forced to make a restructuring decision like the one General Motors is announcing today, it is a sober reminder of the difficult economic times we're facing," Democrat Barack Obama said in a statement. McCain did not discuss GM at a campaign event in New Mexico but plans to visit a company facility in Michigan later this week. Both McCain and Obama have met with auto chiefs recently to hear their concerns. (Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)
