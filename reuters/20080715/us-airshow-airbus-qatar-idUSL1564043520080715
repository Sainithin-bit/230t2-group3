 FARNBOROUGH  (Reuters) - Qatar Airways unveiled a deal to buy up to six Airbus ( EAD.PA ) A321 planes and said it was ready to set up a budget airline to repel any attack by a rival airline on its home market. 

 Chief Executive Officer Akbar al-Baker told reporters that setting up a low-cost carrier depended on rivals eroding Qatar Airways' market share but he was ready to "launch a low-cost carrier within 90 days". Qatar Airways said on Tuesday it had signed a memorandum of understanding to buy up to six A321 narrow-body aircraft from European planemaker Airbus in a deal worth around $540 million at list prices. Four were firm, two were options. Al-Baker also said he was in negotiations with Airbus to buy further A320-family aircraft and hoped to make a further announcement soon. The chief executive was also interested in Bombardier's ( BBDb.TO ) new CSeries 100-145-seat aircraft. Tunisair TAIR.TN meanwhile was set to confirm an order for Airbus A350s, A330s and A320s on Tuesday after signing a letter of acceptance for three A350-800s, three A330-200s and ten A320s earlier this year worth around $1.9 billion at list prices.
