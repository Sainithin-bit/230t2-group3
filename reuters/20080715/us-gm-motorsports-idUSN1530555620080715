 CHICAGO/DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp will reduce spending on motorsports sponsorships as it cuts costs in an attempt to survive a sharp decline in industry sales, a top executive for the U.S. automaker said on Tuesday. 

 "There are some elements of motorsports that are very effective means of promotion and communication with certain customer segments. The ones that are less are the ones that will be ... scaled back," GM North America President Troy Clarke said at a news conference. "It will be gradual, by and large, because we have contractual relationships or support relationships that we'll begin to wind down where that is appropriate," he added. GM said Tuesday it will cut overall costs by $10 billion, suspend its stock dividend and sell up to $4 billion in assets. The restructuring was forced by high gas prices, the shift away from trucks and SUVs, the weakest U.S. auto sales in a decade and growing investor doubts about the Detroit automaker's ability to weather the downturn. While Clarke declined to provide details about the planned cuts, GM spends millions of dollars annually with the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR), the National Hot Rod Association, the American Le Mans Series and other groups. NASCAR is most at risk because GM spends so heavily on the stock car racing organization's three leagues, involving cars and pickup trucks, analysts said. GM spends about $120 million to $140 million a year on NASCAR, including sponsorships and promotions, advertising, and payments to teams and drivers, according to Peter DeLorenzo, publisher of website Autoextremist.com. "The promotional aspect of their involvement with NASCAR is going to be the thing that comes under severe scrutiny," he said. "There are certain people, especially within GM, who have been licking their chops to get at the NASCAR budget." After track sponsorships and promotions, U.S. automakers likely will move to trim national advertising related to NASCAR before finally possibly cutting back on spending for the teams and NASCAR's three leagues, DeLorenzo said. NASCAR officials have watched the struggles of GM and the other U.S. automakers closely, but said their sport offers sponsors a great way to reach its more than 75 million fans. "Attendance has held up well even amid the rising costs of traveling to races," spokesman Andrew Giangola said. "(TV) ratings have increased this season. NASCAR continues to have the most Fortune 500 involvement of any sport." GM's Clarke said the automaker spends a large amount on motorsports, but "any good manager can go in and get 10 or 12 percent of something" in spending cuts. A GM spokeswoman said the automaker has told some tracks over the past couple weeks it will discontinue sponsorships. GM is the official auto sponsor at 12 of the 22 tracks where NASCAR holds its top Sprint Cup Series races, and the automaker also is the title race sponsor at the track in Richmond, Virginia. A track sponsorship typically includes an automaker supplying cars and cash, and receiving signage throughout the venue, Most affected would be International Speedway Corp (ISC), which has sponsorship deals with GM at six of its tracks, and Speedway Motorsports Inc, with four GM deals. The France family owns 67 percent of ISC's voting stock and also owns NASCAR. A Speedway Motorsports spokesman said GM already has told track officials in New Hampshire and Bristol, Tennessee, it will not renew sponsorship deals after they expire this season. ISC's track in Martinsville, Virginia, also has a sponsorship deal with GM that expires after this year. Other automakers may follow GM. Ford Motor Co said spending cuts are likely. "Our past analysis has shown that it still brings a good return on investment," Ford spokesman Kevin Kennedy said. "That doesn't mean you're not going to look at the overall program in light of other cuts the company is making. Racing is certainly going to take some cuts." Chrysler does not plan changes in its NASCAR spending, but is monitoring the economy. Toyota Motor Corp, which joined the top racing series last year, said it remains committed to its motorsports programs, but is reviewing all budgets. (Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)
