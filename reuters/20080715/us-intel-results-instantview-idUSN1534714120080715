 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Intel Corp on Tuesday posted a higher quarterly profit as the world's biggest chipmaker was helped by higher sales of microprocessors used in notebook personal computers. 

 Intel also said it expects revenue in the current quarter of $10.0 billion to $10.6 billion, compared with analyst expectations for revenue of $10.0 billion. Shares were volatile after the report, rising back and forth around the closing price. COMMENTARY: DOUG FREEDMAN, ANALYST, AMERICAN TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH "I like the revenue outlook and the gross margin outlook. "The only slight negative is the spending level on marketing and general administration is slightly higher." (Reporting by  Robert MacMillan , editing by Peter Henderson)
