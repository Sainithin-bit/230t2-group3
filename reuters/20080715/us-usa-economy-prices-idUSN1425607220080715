 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Producer prices rose a far larger-than-expected 1.8 percent in June as energy costs soared, but core inflation at the producer level edged up just 0.2 percent, Labor Department data showed on Tuesday. 

 Economists polled by Reuters had expected producer prices -- a gauge of costs at the farm and factory gate -- to rise by 1.3 percent overall after a 1.4 percent increase in May. Energy prices were up 6.0 percent in June, the largest gain since November 2007. The Labor Department said producer prices over the last 12 months were up 9.2 percent, the biggest increase since a 10.4 percent gain in June 1981. Core producer prices, which strip out volatile energy and food costs, increased by 0.2 percent, the same margin as in May. Economists had expected core prices to rise 0.3 percent in June. On a year-over-year basis, core prices were up 3.0 percent. (Reporting by  Andrea Ricci , Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
