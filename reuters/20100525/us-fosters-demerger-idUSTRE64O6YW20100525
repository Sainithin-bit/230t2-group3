 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Australian brewer Foster's Group FGL.AX plans to pursue the demerger and separate listing of its beer and wine operations, and will take an impairment charge of A$1.1-1.3 billion in fiscal 2010 in relation to its wine assets, it said. 

 Foster's said it expects its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and significant items, or EBITS at A$1.05-1.08 billion in the year to June 2010 and expects the demerger to result in cost savings of at least A$100 million per year from financial 2011, Foster's said on Wednesday.
