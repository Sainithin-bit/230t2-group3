 SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - UBS ( UBSN.VX ) has hired two bankers to join its ultra high net-worth team in Singapore, the bank said in an internal memo. 

 The team will be focused on developing business in Southeast Asian markets, UBS said. Jeremy Tan, who has worked at Citigroup's ( C.N ) private banking unit and Merrill Lynch before, has been appointed as managing director at UBS. Another Citigroup private banker Rennie Lim has also joined UBS as a director. The Swiss bank said it will announce other new hires to the team in due course. (Reporting by Charmian Kok)
