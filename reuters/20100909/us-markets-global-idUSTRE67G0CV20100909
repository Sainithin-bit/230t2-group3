 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Stocks rose and bonds fell on Thursday after stronger-than-expected U.S. data on jobless benefits and trade, raising hopes the tepid economic recovery would accelerate. 

 However, indexes came off their highs as oil prices turned negative and a report said Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ) ( DB.N ) was weighing a share sale of up to $11.4 billion. The yen edged near to a 15-year high against the dollar as investors bet Japanese authorities are not yet ready to curb the currency's strength. New U.S. claims for unemployment insurance fell more than expected last week to their lowest level in two months and the U.S. trade deficit narrowed more than forecast in July as exports shot to the highest level since August 2008, painting a rosier picture for economic growth. Fears of a double-dip recession have kept investors at bay, leaving them poorly positioned with the most recent economic data topping expectations, said Nick Kalivas, senior equity index analyst at MF Global in Chicago. "The economic numbers in the last week or so have been able to beat expectations, so that's providing some confidence that the third quarter will finish firm." The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  rose 28.23 points, or 0.27 percent, to 10,415.24. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX  gained 5.31 points, or 0.48 percent, at 1,104.18. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  rose 7.33 points, or 0.33 percent, to 2,236.20. Concerns about the European banking sector have weighed on investors this week, with new capital rules being discussed. "We might have a little bit of risk aversion going on since those Deutsche Bank headlines came out about the capital raise," said David Lutz, managing director of trading at Stifel Nicolaus Capital Markets in Baltimore. He said there seemed to be some confusion as to whether the German bank was raising money to cover sovereign debt exposure or increase its stake in Deutsche Postbank ( DPBGn.DE ). Capping gains in the Dow industrials, McDonald's Corp ( MCD.N ), the world's largest hamburger chain, dropped 2.7 percent to $74.03 after it reported weaker-than-expected August sales in Europe. Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda said the ministry was conducting simulations on forex intervention. But the Japanese currency hardly budged as the perception remained that Tokyo is unlikely to intervene until the U.S. currency falls near 80 yen. Noda's comments were also undermined somewhat when Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said he did not talk about currencies and monetary policy at a government meeting. The dollar was flat at 83.81 yen, within sight of the 15-year low of 83.34 yen hit on trading platform EBS on Wednesday. The low using Reuters data was 83.32 yen. The dollar is down 9.9 percent against the Japanese currency this year, which is buoyant on global growth concerns. The euro is near a nine-year low against the yen hit in late August. The low on Reuters data was 105.41 yen. The single currency was down 0.11 percent at $1.2706 against the dollar as concerns about the health of the European banking sector and sovereign debt issues persisted. STOCKS UP, BONDS DOWN The December futures contract that trades in Chicago for the Nikkei 225 stock index was up 30 points at 9,140. The FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of top European shares finished 1 percent higher at 1,082.26 points after touching 1,083.46, the highest since late April, supported by U.S. macroeconomic numbers. World stocks measured by MSCI All-Country World Index .MIWD00000PUS rose 0.58 percent. Oil prices fell back to around $74 a barrel as investors shrugged off a government oil inventory report that showed crude stocks unexpectedly fell last week. Spot gold prices fell $11.00, or 0.88 percent, to $1243.70. U.S. government bonds fell on better-than-expected U.S. economic data, boosting riskier assets and hurting demand for a U.S. auction of 30-year debt. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was down 28/32, its yield at 2.7533 percent. The 2-year U.S. Treasury note was down 3/32, the yield at 0.5625 percent. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond was down 62/32, yielding 3.8343 percent versus Wednesday's close of 3.74 percent. (Additional reporting by  Leah Schnurr  in New York, Editing by Dan Grebler)
