 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner urged congressional support for tax breaks for small businesses and said that would help create jobs. 

 "There are much, much more effective things we can do to help businesses get people back to work, like passing these tax incentives for businesses across the country," he said in an interview on Fox Business Network. (Reporting by  Glenn Somerville  and  David Lawder , Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
