 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Eric Dinallo, 47, served under former Attorney General Eliot Spitzer. He is one of five Democratic candidates competing next Tuesday in the Democratic primary for New York Attorney General. 

 Some facts about him: * Dinallo served as an Assistant District Attorney at the Manhattan District Attorney's Office from 1995 to 1999, specializing in white collar crime, including securities fraud. * From 1999 to 2003, he worked for Spitzer's office, where he brought cases of conflict of interest and insider trading on Wall Street. There, he helped resurrect the Martin Act, a little known law that grants the attorney general unique powers to investigate financial fraud. * Leaving the public sector, Dinallo served as managing director for global regulatory affairs at Morgan Stanley. * In 2007, he was named Superintendent of the New York State Insurance Department. * This is Dinallo's first political campaign. He has been endorsed by the New York Daily News. (Reporting by  Edith Honan ; Editing by Basil Katz)
