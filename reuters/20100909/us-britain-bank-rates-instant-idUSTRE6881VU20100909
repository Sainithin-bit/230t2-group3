 LONDON  (Reuters) - The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee held interest rates at 0.5 percent and left its total 200 billion pounds of quantitative easing purchases unchanged on Thursday, as widely expected. Policymakers are keen to keep Britain's recovery on track in the face of austerity measures and a weakening U.S. economy and most analysts reckon they are unlikely to start tightening policy until mid-2011 at the earliest. 

 ANALYST COMMENTS PHILIP RUSH, NOMURA "Developments since the August decision and the accompanying quarterly forecast round were unlikely to have raised much alarm among the committee, despite the continued slowdown in various activity indicators and persistently elevated inflation. As a result, it was no surprise that the MPC left both the Bank rate on hold at 0.5% and the stock of asset purchases funded by the creation of reserves unchanged at 200 billion pounds. "Minutes from the September MPC meeting will be released on 22 September. We expect these to reveal that Andrew Sentance cast the sole dissenting vote again and for it to be in favor of a 25bp rate hike. The divergence of views among MPC members is likely to have remained wider than this vote outcome expectation may imply though." PHILIP SHAW, INVESTEC "As widely anticipated, the MPC kept policy on hold at this month's meeting. This means that the overall stance of monetary policy has been steady for 10 months, and the level of rates frozen for 18 months, the latter extending an MPC record. "With markets more concerned that the global recovery may be losing momentum, it is possible that one or more MPC doves backed an increase in QE this time, opening up the prospect of a 3-way split, if Andrew Sentance continued to vote for a rate rise. As usual, the breakdown of voting will be published with the minutes on 22 September and there was no material accompanying statement from the committee." JAMES KNIGHTLEY, ING "It is likely that Andrew Sentance was the lone dissenter, once again arguing that economic conditions have improved that a move away from "emergency" levels of interest rates is justified. However, the rest of the MPC remain far more cautious. "With BoE Governor King also taking a dovish line there is actually a fairly high chance that further policy stimulus will come ahead of any policy tightening. "Fiscal austerity measures will intensify over the next couple of years with public sector job losses and higher taxes set to act as a brake on growth. Furthermore, there are growing worries about the US' economic prospects with the Federal Reserve acknowledging the weaker growth and jobs outlook, which has prompted us to further scale back our expectations of Federal Reserve policy tightening." LAI WAH CO, CBI "There has been no change to monetary policy, as widely expected. In recent weeks there has been more talk about the need to expand monetary policy, amid concerns about how quickly growth momentum will fade in the coming quarters at home and abroad. However, economic indicators still suggest the UK recovery is on track, although we expect it to be bumpy and slow. "Our view is that monetary policy is likely to stay on hold for a while, as the Bank monitors economic developments." HOWARD ARCHER, IHS GLOBAL INSIGHT "Unchanged interest rates of 0.50% were never a doubt. While Andrew Sentance probably maintained his stance that a small rise in interest rates is justified, he highly likely remained a lone voice within the MPC calling for such a move. "We strongly suspect that the other eight MPC members concluded that the serious headwinds facing what is still overall muted recovery from very deep recession (despite GDP spiking up by 1.2% quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter) warranted unchanged interest rates. Indeed, the MPC may very well be becoming increasingly worried about the risk of a double-dip, particularly given the recent markedly weaker surveys relating to services, manufacturing and construction activity in August. "Meanwhile, although consumer price inflation remains well above target, there are at least signs that underlying inflationary pressures are abating with core consumer price inflation retreating appreciably in July." DAVID KERN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, BRITISH CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE "The decision to leave interest rates and the quantitative easing programme unchanged was the correct one. "Persistent signs of a global economic slowdown, combined with the weaknesses still facing the UK, make it very important for the MPC to persevere with expansionary policies. If the economy shows signs of renewed weakness, the MPC should not hesitate to increase the QE programme. "The Government's tough deficit-reduction measures, although necessary to repair the public finances, will increase the threat of an economic setback. Since sustaining the recovery must remain the priority, it is absolutely vital that the MPC maintains the current low level of interest rates until the middle of 2011 at the earliest." LEE HOPLEY, CHIEF ECONOMIST, ENGINEERING EMPLOYERS' FEDERATION "Over the past month the arguments for any movement in rates or expansion of the asset purchase programme has not materially shifted. Some indicators may have softened and, the potential risks to growth have not gone away, but we're still seeing signs of continued expansion across the economy. "The Bank is right to keep policy on hold until it has a clearer view of the strength of the recovery."
