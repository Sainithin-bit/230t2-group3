 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Casey's General Stores Inc ( CASY.O ) confirmed it was in buyout talks with convenience store operator 7-Eleven, which offered the company $40 per share in cash earlier this month. 

 The $2.03 billion offer topped a $38.50-a-share offered by Canada's largest convenience store chain, Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc ( ATDb.TO ). Ankeny, Iowa-based Casey's had previously said there was a rival bidder to Couche-Tard, without naming it. Casey's said its board "firmly believes that Casey's value substantially exceeds $40 per share" but has authorized discussions with 7-Eleven. Goldman Sachs & Co is its financial advisor, while Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP and Ahlers & Cooney PC are providing legal advice, the company said.
