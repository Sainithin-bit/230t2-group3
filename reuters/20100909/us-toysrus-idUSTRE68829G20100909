 BANGALORE  (Reuters) - U.S. retailer Toys R Us, which has filed for an initial public offering, said it plans to open about 600 temporary stores in malls and shopping centers nationwide, doubling the number of store locations for the holiday season. 

 The world's largest dedicated toy retailer, which currently has 587 full-size Toys"R"Us stores in the United States, said the Toys"R"Us Express store openings will create about 10,000 jobs. The Wayne, New Jersey-based company said the new locations -- 300 of which are already in operation -- began opening in June, and will continue to open through early November. "Similar to last year, the company will look for opportunities to keep select stores open following the holiday season," it said in a statement. Apart from the United States, Toys R Us currently sells its products in more than 510 international stores and 200 licensed stores in 33 countries.
