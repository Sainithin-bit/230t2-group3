 (Reuters) - New U.S. pipeline projects in the Marcellus Shale are set to unlock significant reserves of natural gas in the last few months of this year and in 2013. 
 It is a bearish signal for U.S. gas prices already pressured by oversupply, and extra volumes from the Marcellus - which straddles Pennsylvania, West Virginia, New York and Ohio - could alter flows across the country. Still, the amount of gas flowing along these lines will depend on the appetite of producers willing to hook up new wells to the pipes. Below is a list of pipeline projects expected to be online at the end of 2012 and in 2013.
