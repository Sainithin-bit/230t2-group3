 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Senate formally adjourned for the evening on Tuesday, which could further complicate the fate of a Senate-passed bill to avert $600 billion in tax hikes and spending cuts known as the "fiscal cliff." 
 Democratic Majority leader Harry Reid adjourned the Senate, which hours before passed legislation raising taxes on incomes above $400,000 and other changes to prevent the country from the effects of tumbling over the cliff. House Republicans were meeting on Tuesday to decide whether to act on the bill. They are threatening to send the bill back to the Senate with requested changes.
