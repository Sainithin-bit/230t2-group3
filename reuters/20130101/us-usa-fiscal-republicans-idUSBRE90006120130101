 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Republican members of the U.S. House of Representatives will meet at 1 p.m. ET/1400 GMT Tuesday to discuss "a path forward" after Senate passage of a bipartisan "fiscal cliff" bill, a senior aide said. 
 The meeting could help Republicans leaders decide when to begin consideration of the White House-backed measure. A vote could come as soon as later in the day. (Reporting by  Thomas Ferraro ; Editing by  Bill Trott )
