 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The number of U.S. workers filing new claims for jobless insurance fell for the second week in a row and the four-week moving average of claims was the lowest in nearly a year, government data showed on Thursday, pointing to improvements in the labor market. 

 COMMENTS: BRUCE BITTLES, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, ROBERT W. BAIRD & CO, NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE: "I wasn't surprised by the number. The weekly figures have been improving for the last five to six weeks, and last week we had the lowest four-week average since January. The larger question is, are new jobs becoming available? I don't think they are, and that's why I don't think the market will celebrate this today. I don't think we'll see new jobs opening until late 2010. "As the economy strengthens, that might strengthen the dollar. Its been dollar weakness that's been driving the market, so you have to be careful what you wish for."
