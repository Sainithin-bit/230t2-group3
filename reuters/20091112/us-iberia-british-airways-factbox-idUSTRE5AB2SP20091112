 MADRID/LONDON  (Reuters) - The boards of British Airways and Spain's Iberia are holding separate board meetings to consider a merger to create the world's third largest airline measured by revenue. 

 Following are some key facts about the potential new carrier: -- Aircraft: 408 aircraft (BA 244; Iberia 164*) -- Destinations: 259 airports (BA 150; Iberia 109) -- Passengers per year: 61.5 million (33 million, Iberia 28.5 million*) -- Staff: 63,600 (BA 42,000; Iberia 21,600) -- Turnover (2009E**): $21.65 billion (BA 8.9 bln stg; Iberia 4.6 bln eur) -- Pretax profit (2009E**): BA 401 mln stg pretax loss; Iberia 228.8 mln euro loss) RATIONALE -- Greater financial muscle and more routes to compete with European giants Air France-KLM and Lufthansa -- Cost savings and greater buying power on fuel, aircraft, IT and other products that analysts estimate is worth some 550 million euros a year through to 2015. -- Very few overlapping routes. Iberia has the biggest share of the Europe-Latin America market, while BA is the leading airline on North Atlantic routes and has strong Europe-Asia connections -- Ends BA's two-year chase for Iberia. Fulfils Iberia's long-time desire for consolidation Sources: Reuters; British Airways; Iberia * Including Iberia's franchise Air Nostrum. ** Figures expected by analysts for year to March 2009, as polled by Reuters.
