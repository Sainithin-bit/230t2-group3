 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Pacific Investment Management Co, the world's biggest manager of bond funds, named Mohamed El-Erian as its sole chief executive after co-CEO Bill Thompson retires at the end of the year. 

 El-Erian returned to Pimco as co-CEO in January from Harvard University, where for two years he managed the school's $35 billion endowment. A specialist in emerging markets bonds with a record of outperformance, El-Erian had left Pimco to run the Harvard endowment, which is the world's largest. El-Erian, 50, will also continue in his role as co-chief investment officer with founder Bill Gross, the Newport Beach, California-based company said late Thursday. Thompson, 63, led Pimco for 15 years. During that period, the firm expanded from 125 employees and $40 billion in assets more than 1,000 employees and $840 billion of assets. "PIMCO is going from 'strength to strength' as Mohamed takes the CEO reins from Bill," Gross said in a statement. German insurer Allianz ( ALVG.DE ) bought about 70 percent of Pimco in 2000.
