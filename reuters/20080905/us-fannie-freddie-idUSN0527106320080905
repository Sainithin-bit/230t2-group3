 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Mortgage finance giants, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, declined to comment on a Wall Street Journal story saying the U.S. Treasury is close to finalizing a plan to backstop the two government-sponsored enterprises, or GSEs. 

 Janis Smith, spokeswoman for Fannie Mae, and Sharon McHale, spokeswoman for Freddie Mac, told Reuters the companies have no comment on the story. The Wall Street Journal's website said the plan could be announced as early as this weekend and it could include senior management changes. (Reporting by Julie Haviv)
