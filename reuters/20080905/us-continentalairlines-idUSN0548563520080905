 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Continental Airlines Inc said on Friday it will charge a $15 service fee for a first checked bag for certain customers who buy economy-class tickets. 

 The fee applies immediately to tickets bought for destinations in the United States and to flights between the United States and Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Canada for travel starting on or after October 7. Continental said the fee will not apply to its "EliteAccess" customers, travelers on full-fare economy tickets, or to military personnel and their families on official orders. Amid high fuel prices and a slowing U.S. economy, airlines have been introducing fees, raising fares, and cutting routes, capacity and jobs in order to survive. Earlier this year, Continental introduced a $25 fee on a second checked bag for many economy-class customers. (Reporting by  Mark McSherry , editing by Dave Zimmerman)
