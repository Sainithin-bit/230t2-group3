 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of Washington Mutual ( WM.N ) fell on Thursday, extending Wednesday's steep losses, amid ongoing worries about its ability to find a buyer and to raise enough capital to cover soaring mortgage losses. 

 The stock of the biggest U.S. savings and loan was last $2.06 in pre-market trading on the New York Stock Exchange, down 11 percent from Wednesday's close. (Reporting by  Richard Leong ; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
