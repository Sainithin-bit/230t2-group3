 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department, asked about further steep falls in Lehman Brothers' on Thursday, said it was continuing to monitor markets and was keeping in touch with market participants. 

 Lehman shares on Thursday opened about 38 percent down from Wednesday's sharply lower close as investors continue the question the bank's ability to survive by selling assets to cover real estate-related losses. Asked about Thursday's falls, Treasury spokeswoman Brookly McLaughlin repeated earlier comments the Treasury has made about Lehman's situation. "We're monitoring markets and we're in regular contact with market participants," she said. (Reporting by  David Lawder ; Editing by Theodore d'Afflisio)
