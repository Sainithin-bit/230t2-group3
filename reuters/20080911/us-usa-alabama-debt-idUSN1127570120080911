 MIAMI  (Reuters) - Creditors, insurers and lawyers for Alabama's Jefferson County met on a proposed restructuring of $3.2 billion of sewer debt on Wednesday but struck no bargain to avert a possible municipal bankruptcy. 

 Going into the two-and-a-half-hour meeting at the governor's office in Montgomery, Alabama, officials had downplayed possibilities of a deal being reached quickly in the high-stakes standoff that began half a year ago. The negotiators are working against a September 30 deadline to restructure the sewer debt and related interest-rate swaps. The county has ordered lawyers to prepare for a possible Chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy filing if a deal is not reached. A bankruptcy filing by Jefferson County, which is home to Birmingham, would be the biggest by a U.S. local government since Orange County, California, filed for protection in 1994. "The purpose of their meeting was to continue discussions about resolving the county's sewer debt," the office of Gov. Bob Riley said in a news release. Riley, who did not attend the meeting among lawyers for key creditor JPMorgan Chase ( JPM.N ), bond insurers and the county and state government, "has been informed of its proceedings and he will continue working with all the parties to try to reach a solution," his office said. Both sides were expected to keep bargaining but no new dates have been set, county officials said on Thursday. Riley entered the talks two weeks ago and announced on August 29 that Wall Street creditors were considering a new debt restructuring plan. Details of the plan and Wednesday's meeting were not made public but the Birmingham News reported that creditors on Wednesday again inquired about tapping county sales taxes and occupational taxes to help satisfy the sewer bond debt. Earlier efforts to use those monies floundered, partly because state legislators have declined to make changes in state law needed to steer those revenue sources to debt service. Any bid to use local sales and occupational taxes for the sewer debt would fail, Jefferson County officials said on Thursday. "They are trying to put sales tax and occupational taxes back on the table. They are off the table," said County Commissioner Jim Carns, who oversees the county's sewer and environmental operations. Another commissioner, Bettye Fine Collins, said the Wednesday meeting was a disappointment. "If this is a chess game, we are currently at a stalemate," Collins said in interview. "The lenders must think they will get a better deal from a bankruptcy judge." In addition to JPMorgan, lawyers for insurers Syncora Guarantee Inc, a unit of Syncora Holdings Ltd SCA.N, and Financial Guaranty Insurance Corp attended the meeting, according to the newspaper report. The two insurers have exposure on about $2 billion of the sewer debt and have made some payments to Jefferson County creditors. The county's $3.2 billion of sewer bonds is made up of about $2 billion of auction-rate securities, $850 million of variable-rate demand notes and the remainder in fixed-rate bonds, according to Standard & Poor's Ratings Services analysts. The county so far has only defaulted on the insured variable-rate debt, which is being held by liquidity providers, they added.
