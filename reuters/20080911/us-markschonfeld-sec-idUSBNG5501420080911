 (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's top New York enforcement attorney is expected to leave next month for a law firm, people familiar with the matter told The Wall Street Journal. Mark Schonfeld, 45, has been the top cop at the SEC's New York regional office since 2004 and has overseen and investigated some of the biggest cases to have crossed Wall Street. One person familiar with the matter told the Journal that Schonfeld was heading to Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP. No one was available at the SEC for comments. (Reporting by Sweta Singh in Bangalore)
