 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc's bonds tumbled, sending yields soaring to distressed levels amid skepticism about a revival plan for the investment bank. 

 Some Lehman bond yields surged to 15 percent or more, indicating traders now view the debt as riskier than many junk bonds. A Wall Street dealer also told Reuters that some Lehman two-year notes traded at a yield of 40 percent on Thursday, a severely distressed level. "The market is reflecting deep stress at the company," which may provide value for some investors," said Cynthia Cole, a portfolio manager for Allegiant Asset Management in Cleveland, Ohio, where she oversees about $15 billion in fixed-income assets. "This tells you something has to change." Wall Street's fourth-largest investment bank will have to announce a structural change or sale of assets, Cole said. "Something needs to point to a positive outcome going forward," said Cole, who has been buying financial debt due to recent declines in bond prices. Five-year credit default swaps on Lehman traded at 745 basis points on Thursday, or $745,000 a year to protect $10 million of debt, widening 165 basis points from Wednesday's close, according to Phoenix Partners Group. On Wednesday those credit spreads had climbed as high as 610 basis points, surpassing record levels reached in March in the wake of the collapse of Bear Stearns. At Wednesday's levels, Lehman's credit default swaps already were trading as though the company were rated "B1," a mid-level junk rating that is eight steps below its actual rating, according to the credit strategy group of Moody's Investors Service. Some Lehman debt, rated in the "single A" investment-grade category by all three major agencies, is trading at junk bond levels, suggesting bond traders are increasing bets that Lehman's ratings may be downgraded. Moody's Investors Service, Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings on Wednesday said they may cut Lehman's ratings after the bank posted a large third-quarter loss and announced plans to bolster capital. For details, click Lehman's 6.625 percent notes due in 2012 fell to 77 cents on the dollar on Thursday, down from 96.5 cents on Tuesday, the last significant trade, pushing yields to 15.7 percent, according to MarketAxess. The bonds also now are yielding 12.87 percentage points more than Treasuries. Bonds are considered distressed when they yield at least 10 percentage points over Treasuries.
