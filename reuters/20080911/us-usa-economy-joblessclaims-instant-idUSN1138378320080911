 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The number of U.S. workers filing new claims for jobless benefits declined by 6,000 last week, the Labor Department reported on Thursday, but the longer-term trend toward a weakening labor market remained intact. 

 TRADE The U.S. trade deficit widened much more than expected in July as average oil prices jumped to a record $124.66 per barrel and the volume of crude oil imports grew to the highest in four years, a U.S. government report showed on Thursday.  KEY POINTS:  JOBLESS * Initial claims for state unemployment insurance benefits dropped to a seasonally adjusted 445,000 during the week ended September 6 from a revised 451,000 in the prior week. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast 440,000 claims last week. * The latest reporting week included the Labor Day holiday but department officials said seasonal adjustment factors took that into account. * The number of continued claims -- people remaining on benefit rolls after drawing an initial week of aid -- shot up by 122,000 to 3.53 million in the week ended August 30, the latest period for which the data is available.  TRADE * The monthly trade gap swelled to $62.2 billion, the largest since March 2007, from an upwardly revised estimate of $58.84 billion in June. * Wall Street analysts had forecast the deficit to expand to $58.0 billion from the original June tally of $56.8 billion. * As crude oil prices surged in July, the volume of oil imports jumped 15 percent to 342 million barrels, the highest since June 2004 even though prices were almost double the average of last July. * Total petroleum imports hit a record $51.4 billion, helping lift overall imports of goods and services 3.9 percent to a record $230.3 billion.  COMMENTS:  MARC PADO, U.S. MARKET STRATEGIST, CANTOR FITZGERALD & CO., SAN  FRANCISCO: TRADE: "It's pretty much in the range of where it was expected, it's not too negative there. Obviously the trade deficit jumped a bit, which is more than expected, but it was on that oil import number. "We know that number is going to come down in the very near future... You can see that in August import petroleum prices were down 12.8 percent. You know that's going to have an impact on the trade deficit going forward. You can almost overlook that trade deficit because of what has happened since. "People are concerned that the dollar's going to change what's going on with exports. I really disagree with that. It takes years to build up a relationship and to build a business for exports. It doesn't change with the first tick of the dollar."  KEVIN LOGAN, SENIOR U.S. ECONOMIST, DRESDNER KLEINWORT, NEW  YORK: JOBLESS: "There are two factors that are effecting the overall economy right now, one is the weakening of the overall economy -- it is clear that we are in a downtrend, the demand for labor has been softening -- but it is also clear that there have been some weather disruptions with the hurricanes. The numbers certainly look worrisome. We talking about hurricanes but if claims don't go down soon, they are an indication that the labor market is really deteriorating." INTERNATIONAL TRADE: "The deficit increased quite a bit but it is all in petroleum, there is a lagged effect from those price increases, we had a $6.3 billion jump in the cost of crude oil and that will certainly put a dent in your trade deficit." IMPORT/EXPORT PRICES: "Exports rose, so the uptrend in exports is still pretty robust. The real trade balance in July was an improvement over the average for the second quarter so the contribution to GDP from trade should still be positive despite this big nominal swing in the deficit in July."  DAVE LUTZ, MANAGING DIRECTOR, STIFEL NICOLAUS & CO.,  BALTIMORE: "Everyone is looking at Lehman Brothers. The trade data are less favorable than expected. The jobless claims numbers are irrelevant. Everything is off Lehman. That's the focus today."  SCOTT BROWN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, RAYMOND JAMES & ASSOCIATES, ST  PETERSBURG, FLORIDA: "Without focusing too much on week-to-week developments, the trend for jobless claims is clearly higher, which is consistent with more significant job destruction." "Treasuries have not reacted much to the data. The bond market is looking more closely at the stock market, which is poised to open sharply lower. The mood in the financial sector is clearly bad."  MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. equity index futures extend fall BONDS: U.S. Treasury prices add slightly gains DOLLAR: U.S. dollar extends losses versus yen RATE FUTURES: Fed fund futures show an 8 percent chance of a rate cut in September.
