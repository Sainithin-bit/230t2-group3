 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales excluding cars rose in August but at a slower pace, as high gasoline and food prices cut into spending on other goods and services, a private report released on Thursday showed. 

 Consumer spending without autos rose 0.4 percent last month on a seasonally adjusted basis, less than the 1 percent increase in July, said SpendingPulse, the retail data service of MasterCard Advisors, an arm of MasterCard Worldwide ( MA.N ). "People are focusing on the essentials which are going up and up," said Kamalesh Rao, director of economic research at MasterCard Advisors. This attention to household staples had caused shoppers to pare back on items such as clothes and consumer electronics, which typically enjoy sales bumps in late summer as students return to school. "It was probably a disappointing back-to-school season," Rao said. Apparel sales were down 1.4 percent in August from a year ago, while year-over-year electronics sales were off 5.5 percent last month, according to SpendingPulse. While weak discretionary spending reined in overall sales growth, rising prices and firm demand for certain staples have fueled moderate sales growth, it said. Non-durable goods prices grew 10.3 percent year-over-year in August, slower than the 11.9 percent pace in July. Gasoline prices continued to fall with oil after peaking in mid-July. They averaged $3.65 a gallon in the week ended Sept 8, down 3 cents from the prior week but up 83 cents from a year earlier, the government said on Monday. SpendingPulse's "core" measure on consumer spending, which factors out cars, gasoline and building materials, grew 0.9 percent in August, versus a 1 percent fall in July. Despite a rebound in core spending, it is unclear whether August's sales growth could be sustained as consumers struggle with tight credits and deteriorating job conditions, Rao said. "Given what's happening in the job market, there's a cloud hanging over the consumers," he said. The SpendingPulse data are derived from the aggregate sales in the MasterCard U.S. payment network, coupled with estimates on all other payment methods including cash and check.
