 CARACAS  (Reuters) - Venezuela has ordered U.S. airlines to reduce flights after the United States questioned the country's airport security, a Venezuelan newspaper reported on Thursday. 

 The move opens a new of source of tension between Venezuela and the United States, which regularly clash over President Hugo Chavez's policies on drugs, free trade and oil prices despite the OPEC nation being a major energy supplier to America. Delta Airlines confirmed it received notification from the Venezuelan government of the order, which takes effect on September 28. Officials at AMR Corp's American Airlines and Continental, which Caracas daily El Universal reported were also affected, could not be immediately reached for comment. "This is an issue between the U.S. and Venezuelan government," said Carlos Santos, a spokesman for Delta Airlines. "We're hopeful this will be resolved and the two sides can reach a solution quickly." On Monday, the United States issued a travel advisory questioning security measures at Venezuelan airports -- a decision that drew sharp criticism from Venezuelan officials.
