 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Lehman Brothers, struggling to survive, is planning to sell assets, including the office space it leases and owns and that may pressure an already soft Manhattan office market, experts said on Wednesday. 

 The Wall Street firm owns or leases more than 2.2 million square feet of office space in midtown Manhattan. It has more than 300,000 square feet of office sublet space on the market -- 135,000 square feet at 605 Third Ave, as well as 165,000 square feet at Boston Properties Inc's 399 Park Ave. Unofficially, Lehman is also offering another 400,000 square feet of sublet space at Rockefeller Centers' 1271 Avenue of the Americas and at 1301 Avenue of the Americas, owned by Paramount Group, three sources familiar with the matter said. After posting a record quarterly loss of $3.9 billion on Wednesday, Lehman said it would sell $4 billion in British mortgages to BlackRock Inc, and spin off $25 billion to $30 billion in commercial real estate assets into a separate company known as Real Estate Investments Global. It also said it has cut 1,500 since May 31. Lehman is trying desperately not to follow Bear Stearns, which was near collapse when it was bought out by JPMorgan Chase & Co in the spring. MORE SPACE DARKENS MOOD The financial services industry usually accounts for about a third of the demand for office space in Manhattan. The additional space and yet another weakened player could exacerbate the market's slowdown, said Peter Riguardi, president of the New York Region for real estate brokerage Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. "It will make a number of potential tenants who are thinking about moving say maybe I should wait and see what happens," Riguardi said. "All of that leads to a correction." Over the last few years, a shortage of new construction and a booming economy sent rental rates in the best Manhattan office buildings up an average 50 percent over two years. The vacancy rate fell to about 5.3 percent. "They were leasing space based on growth projections of 5 or 10 percent," Riguardi said, referring to the financial services sector. "They have all this space that was to be ready in 2009, 10, 11 in anticipation there would be headcount growth." But after the credit crisis hit the financial markets a little more than a year ago, financial services firms backed off their demand for space, pushing Manhattan's second-quarter vacancy rate to 7.1 percent, according to Cushman & Wakefield. "Obviously you don't have the headcount growth, and you have cutbacks," Riguardi said. Lehman also has a stake in its 1.1 million square foot headquarters at 745 Seventh Ave in Manhattan. Before the credit crisis deepened, the 38-story building in the Times Square area could have commanded more than $1,000 a square foot, or over $1.03 billion, said Scott Latham, executive vice president of real estate services company Cushman & Wakefield's Capital Markets Group. "It's a spectacular piece of property," Latham said. But the real estate market has softened. Mortgage money that drove the market to its peak last year is hard to come by and expensive today. Buyers are demanding softer pricing. Additionally, the ownership of the building is complicated. The building was the result of an agreement between Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co and The Rockefeller Group. The agreement called for Morgan Stanley to own the building and lease the land from The Rockefeller Group for 30 years and then the two would own it in a joint venture. Complicating that, Rockefeller has a right of first offer, according to a person involved in the original sale. Just as construction was completing, Lehman bought Morgan Stanley's portion of the deal for $700 million. Moreover, the building's value today would depend upon its tenants' credit-worthiness and ability to pay rent, real estate experts said. "Gone are the days when people are looking at square-foot metrics," Latham said. "It's all about returns now, and returns that a piece of real estate can generate." On Wednesday Moody's Investors Service said Lehman would have to take further action than raising capital in order to preserve its "A2" credit rating. Standard & Poor's Rating Services said its rating on Lehman remains on watch negative after the announced loss. (Editing by  Bernard Orr )
