 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department, asked about reports that the government could intervene to help embattled investment bank Lehman Brothers, said it was continuing to monitor markets and was keeping in touch with market participants. 

 "We are monitoring markets and in regular contact with market participants," a Treasury spokeswoman said. A source told Reuters that options for Lehman ranged from a full acquisition to a government intervention. The Washington Post, citing sources familiar with the matter, reported the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve were engineering a sale of Lehman Brothers through a consortium of private firms.
