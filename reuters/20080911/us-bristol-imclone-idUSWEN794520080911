 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co ( BMY.N ) stood by its $60-a-share offer for ImClone Systems Inc IMCL.O, a day after the biotechnology company spurned Bristol's offer and said it had another bid at $70 a share. 

 Bristol-Myers released a letter to ImClone Chairman Carl Icahn on Thursday saying it was disappointed ImClone "unilaterally rejected our offer without discussing its merits with us and our advisors." But Icahn responded in a letter addressed to Bristol's Chief Executive James Cornelius that he had tried to reach Bristol to discuss ImClone's position before making it public. Bristol-Myers also said it had no intention of agreeing to any changes to its long-term marketing rights to Erbitux, the cancer drug that is ImClone's lone product on the market, or for any related drugs, including IMC-11F8, a closely watched potential successor to Erbitux. Billionaire activist investor Icahn said in his letter that he disagreed "that Bristol's rights are clear" regarding IMC-11F8 and that ImClone's was not waiving any rights. It is unclear who has the rights to IMC-11F8, although Deutsche Bank analyst Barbara Ryan said Bristol's comments indicate it feels strongly it controls those rights. "If that it is true, then it's difficult for somebody else perhaps to pay more," Ryan said. ImClone shares closed down $1.01, or 1.5 percent, at $66.93 on Thursday after Bristol released the letter. Bristol shares finished up 16 cents at $21.83. Bristol-Myers, which has had a long partnership with ImClone, markets Erbitux in the United States and receives about 61 percent of the drug's North American revenue. "We continue to look forward to engaging directly with ImClone and its financial and legal advisors to discuss the merits of our all-cash offer," Bristol-Myers CEO James Cornelius said in the letter. "ImClone also should understand that our offer is for the entire company, and any potential restructuring of the company could severely jeopardize ImClone's value and deprive ImClone's stockholders of the benefits of our offer," Cornelius said. Icahn said that "with respect to a potential restructuring of ImClone" the company would act in what it considers the best interests of all its shareholders and "not just Bristol." Icahn had said on Wednesday that he had been involved in several conversations with the CEO of an unspecified large pharmaceutical company, culminating in the $70-a-share proposal. That offer values ImClone at $6.1 billion, based on the number of shares outstanding at the time of the company's latest quarterly report, and would represent a 51 percent premium over ImClone's closing price on July 30, the day before Bristol-Myers announced its $60-per-share offer. Icahn said the company would respond appropriately if Bristol was to make another offer. One banking official familiar with a number of other pharmaceutical companies, speaking on condition of anonymity, said ImClone was still attractive to other companies, despite the Erbitux lock-ins, because it offered revenue growth -- even if most of it would be royalty-based. Two people familiar with the situation said that Germany's Merck KGaA ( MRCG.DE ), which also shares Erbitux rights outside the United States, was not interested in buying ImClone. One source said Merck does not want to stretch that far financially and feels it's got everything it needs already from its current arrangement with ImClone. Bristol said its offer for the roughly 83 percent of ImClone it does not already own was not subject to due diligence. ImClone said on Wednesday the bid from the other unspecified pharmaceutical company was subject to due diligence and would allow the company a two-week due diligence period. Ryan said the due diligence was likely largely related to the rights surrounding IMC-11F8. (Additional reporting by  Ben Hirschler  in London, editing by Derek Caney and  Andre Grenon )
