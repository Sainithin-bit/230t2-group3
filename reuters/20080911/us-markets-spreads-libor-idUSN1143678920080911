 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Two measures of bank aversion to lending to one another on Thursday reached their highest levels in months as investors pondered the chances of survival for U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers. 

 The spread between the nominal London interbank offered rate (Libor) for three-month dollar rates and three-month Overnight Index Swap (OIS) rates on Thursday widened to its biggest since late April. Libor/OIS spreads are seen as an indication of banks' inclination to lend to one another, with a wider spread suggesting tougher lending conditions. Also on Thursday, the spread between Libor and the yield on 3-month U.S. Treasury bills, known as the TED spread, reached its widest since late July. The TED spread is also seen as a proxy for banks' willingness to lend to each other. Widening of the two spreads is an indication "that banks don't want to take each other's credit," said Howard Simons, strategist with Bianco Research in Chicago, adding "there is a flight to safety." Both of the spreads widened significantly in the summer of 2007 at the beginning of the global credit crisis, and although the spreads have fluctuated since, they have remained at wide levels in comparison. Confidence in financial companies remained shaky on Thursday amid investor disappointment at Lehman Brother's failure to announce definitive deals to raise much-needed capital. Lehman's shares plunged as investors questioned whether the company would be able to continue to survive. "Obviously there are a lot of liquidity perceptions that surround that," James Caron, co-head of global rates research at Morgan Stanley in New York, said of the widening of the Libor/OIS and TED spreads, adding however, "these spreads have popped out, but I don't think anything has changed except for the perception of systemic risk."
