 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - American International Group Inc ( AIG.N ), the world's largest insurer, holds between $550 million and $600 million in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac preferred shares, according to a source familiar with the investment. 

 Investors have been biting their nails over companies' holdings of the agencies' preferred shares, with concern that the recent government takeover of the giant home-funding companies could wipe out value. Insurers in total own about $4 billion in Fannie Mae FNM.N and Freddie Mac FRE.N preferred stock, according to earlier figures compiled by rating agency A.M. Best.
