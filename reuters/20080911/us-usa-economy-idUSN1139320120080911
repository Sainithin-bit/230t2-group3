 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Record oil import prices propelled the U.S. trade deficit to a 16-month high in July, but a sharp price drop in August promised narrower deficits in future months, government reports showed on Thursday. 

 In a sign of continued weakness in the U.S. labor market, the number of U.S. workers collecting jobless benefits shot up by 122,000 to 3.53 million in the week ended August 30, the highest level since October 2003. Financial market traders mostly ignored the reports, focusing instead on the fate of the beleaguered financial services firm Lehman Brothers LEH.N and a drop in crude oil futures prices toward $100 per barrel. The monthly trade gap swelled to $62.2 billion, the largest since March 2007, as average oil import prices leaped 6.4 percent to $124.66 per barrel and the volume of oil imports jumped 15 percent to 342 million barrels, the highest since June 2004. Oil futures contracts traded above a record $147 per barrel in July, supported by tensions over Iran's nuclear program, the weak U.S. dollar and oil supply concerns coupled with strong emerging-market demand. The U.S. petroleum import bill hit a record $51.4 billion that month, propelling imports of goods and services up 3.9 percent to a record $230.3 billion, the Commerce Department said. But more recent data from the Labor Department showed oil import prices dropped 12.8 percent in August, the steepest decline since April 2003, amid signs of slowing U.S. and global economic growth. U.S. crude oil future prices have continued to sink in September and dropped $1.71 to settle at $100.87 a barrel on Thursday at the New York Mercantile Exchange on a combination of weak demand and a firmer U.S. dollar. U.S. stocks rose, with major indexes up over 1.3 percent, after a report late on Thursday that Bank of America ( BAC.N ) was in talks to buy Lehman Brothers. U.S. government debt prices were mixed. Despite the jump in the July trade deficit, "we know that number is going to come down in the very near future. ... You can almost overlook the trade deficit because of what has happened since," said Marc Pado, U.S. market strategist with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. in San Francisco. Roger Kubarych, chief U.S. economist at European investment bank UniCredit, said: "The speculative run-up in oil and other commodity prices ran its course this summer and the correction has been stunning in speed and magnitude." Even so, U.S. Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez said the July trade data bolstered the Bush administration's case for Congress to expand oil production in restricted areas. "We need to produce more of our oil instead of letting imports of petroleum from other countries be a drag on our economy," Gutierrez said in an interview. At a time when "exports are driving the U.S. economy," Congress also should give them a boost by approving free trade agreements with Colombia, Panama and South Korea, he said. ECONOMY STILL SOFT Imports of autos and consumer goods declined slightly in July and two other categories -- food, feeds and beverages and capital goods -- rose only slightly in a sign that weakness in the U.S. economy is crimping demand for foreign goods. Combined with strong growth in U.S. exports, that shrank the nonpetroleum deficit in July to its lowest level since October 2002, while the petroleum deficit hit a record $43.4 billion. Data on Thursday suggested the U.S. economy remained weak. While first-time claims for jobless benefits fell 6,000 last week, analysts said the labor market was still soft. And retail sales data showed consumption moderating in August. U.S. retail sales excluding cars rose O.4 percent in August, slowing from a 1 percent gain in July, a report by SpendingPulse, the retail data service of MasterCard Advisors, an arm of MasterCard Worldwide, showed. Exports of U.S. goods and services increased 3.3 percent to a record $168.1 billion in July, with industrial supplies and materials, capital goods, autos and auto parts and consumer goods all setting individual records. "U.S. businesses continue to be competitive in world markets, which are still expanding on balance," Kuybarch said. "Some slowdown is likely as global business activity tapers off and the impact of a stronger dollar curbs demand for U.S. products. But that effect is certainly not evident in the July trade data," he added. The closely watched trade gap with China widened 16.1 percent to $24.9 billion in July and remained slightly ahead of last year's record pace. "That just can't continue. It weakens our economy, reflects the movement of U.S. jobs to China and creates mounting debt that must be paid," Sen. Bryon Dorgan, a North Dakota Democrat, said in a statement.
