 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. authorities were in intensive talks with Lehman Brothers over a possible sale of the troubled investment bank to one or more parties, a source with direct knowledge of the discussions said. 

 A number of firms are looking at Lehman and at least one is looking to acquire the entire firm, the source said. A number of other options are also being considered, including a partial sale, government intervention, or unwinding of Lehman's assets, this source said.
