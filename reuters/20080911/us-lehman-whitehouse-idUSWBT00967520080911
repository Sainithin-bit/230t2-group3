 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The White House on Thursday declined to comment on the situation at Lehman Brothers as questions swirled about whether the investment bank could survive by selling assets to cover its real estate-related losses. 

 "We'll decline to comment," said White House spokesman Tony Fratto said in response to a request for comment about the company's situation and if the White House had been in touch with Lehman officials. (Reporting by  Jeremy Pelofsky , Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
