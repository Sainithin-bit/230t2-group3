 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Standard & Poor's does not expect a federal bailout of Lehman Brothers, which is benefiting from a federal lending facility and has sufficient resources to sustain recent losses, an S&P analyst said on Thursday. 

 "The company has sufficient wherewithal to sustain a period of diminished confidence, but of course there's a limit to it," S&P analyst Scott Sprinzen told Reuters. "We'll have to see what transpires." (Reporting by  Walden Siew , Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
