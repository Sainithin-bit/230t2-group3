 LONDON  (Reuters) - Finance ministers from the G20 group of industrial and emerging countries meet in Washington on Friday to review pledges made in 2009 to strengthen regulation and learn the lessons of the credit crunch. 

 The focus is on the European Union and United States, where much of the financial crisis played out. The United States is trying to adopt a single piece of legislation that covers the G20 pledges. The EU is adopting a string of measures on credit rating agencies, hedge funds, bank capital and supervision. Differences are emerging among G20 members, prompting the International Monetary Fund to call for unity on Thursday. Following is a state-of-play on the main regulatory pledges, many of which are not due to take effect until the end of 2012. BANK CAPITAL: Higher and better quality capital requirements by end of 2012: The G20 wants banks to set aside more capital, with a higher proportion in the form of common stock. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision put forward a draft package of Basel III reforms in December. Consultation ended last week. Basel aims to finalize the rules by the November G20 summit. Most banks already hold more capital than under the existing Basel II accord. Issues: Banks warn that introducing the measures on time could derail recovery by making it harder for them to keep lending and building up capital. The Basel reforms are seen as the core response to the crisis but some policymakers and countries like Canada fear that parallel discussions on a possible bank tax could crowd out the Basel timetable. Several aspects of the Basel package has also generated heated debate, including leverage ratios, the treatment of minority stakes, deferred taxes and what constitutes top quality liquidity. HEDGE FUNDS: The G20 agreed hedge funds above a certain size should be authorized and obliged to report data to supervisors. The EU has proposed a draft law that is dividing member states, with Britain saying it goes well beyond the G20 pledge and restricts fund managers outside the EU, while France wants tougher rules. A final deal is expected in 2010. U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has complained to the EU that its draft rules are too restrictive. A U.S. bill is going through Congress along the lines of the G20 pledge, but the Senate wants to exempt venture capital and private equity, which the draft EU rules cover. DERIVATIVES: The G20 called for greater standardization and central clearing of privately arranged over-the-counter (OTC) contracts by the end of 2012 to cut risk and improve transparency. Contracts should also be traded on an exchange or platform, where appropriate. Central clearing of credit default swaps traded in the EU and United States has already started. The U.S. is well on way to adopting new rules but the EU won't make formal legislative proposals until June. Issues: Some members of the EU are calling for tough curbs on "naked" selling of sovereign credit default swaps but U.S. regulators are leery. The United States is keen to push OTC business onto exchanges while the EU focusing more on central clearing of contracts. ACCOUNTING: The G20 set a mid-2011 deadline for creating a single set of high-quality accounting rules, which essentially means thrashing out common ground between the International Accounting Standards Board and the U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board to give investors greater transparency. Issues: Disagreement is emerging between IASB and FASB over the extent to which the pricing of financial instruments should be based on the going market rate or what they originally cost. SECURITISATION: The G20 wants banks to start retaining some of the securitized products they sell by 2010. The EU has adopted a law mandating retention of 5.0 percent, with the United States Senate wanting to follow suit. CREDIT RATING AGENCIES: The G20 wanted them registered and supervised by the end of 2009. The EU has adopted a law mandating registration and direct supervision that takes effect this year. A U.S. bill on rating agencies has yet to be adopted but the House and Senate have similar approaches. FINANCIAL SUPERVISION: The G20 called for supervision of systemic risk at local and international level. The EU's executive European Commission has proposed draft laws to create a European Systemic Risk Board, hosted by the European Central Bank, due to be in place during 2010. Three new pan-EU supervisory authorities for banks, markets and insurers are to work closely with the ESRB. Issues: Spats within the EU over how powerful the new EU authorities should be threaten to slow down approval. It is still unclear how much of a role the Federal Reserve would play in a new U.S. entity to monitor systemic risk. PAY: The G20 has endorsed principles to stop bonus schemes in banks from encouraging too much short-term risk taking, such as deferral of part of a bonus, including a clawback mechanism, payment in the form of shares rather than cash and avoiding multi-year guaranteed bonuses. Issues: Not all G20 members have applied the new principles. 'TOO BIG TO FAIL' A series of measures are envisaged to avoid taxpayers having to foot the bill for any future bailouts: The International Monetary Fund has proposed a global bank tax to pay for bailouts: there backing in principle from Britain, United States, France and Germany but Canada is opposed. Among those who back a tax, there is disagreement over its structure and use. The United States has proposed a "Volcker Rule" to ban risky proprietary trading but EU has rejected such moves. The G20 wants banks to build up extra capital buffers in good times to tap in troubled markets and lessen the need for taxpayer bailouts. The Basel Committee formulating principles for such a mechanism, but there are arguments over who and what should trigger a build-up of buffers. Systemically important firms should develop contingency and resolution plans -- "living wills" -- by the end of 2010. Britain is already running pilot program. Possible "surcharges" on systemically important firms. The Basel Committee still looking at this.
