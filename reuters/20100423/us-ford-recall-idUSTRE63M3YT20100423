 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co will recall 33,256 of its 2010 model year cars and SUVs to replace potentially faulty front seat recliner mechanisms that could lead to injuries in an accident, according to a notice filed with U.S. safety regulators. 

 Ford notified the U.S. Highway Traffic Safety Administration of the potential defect by letter dated April 16. Ford said it knew of no reports of accidents or injuries due to the defect as of April 14. The automaker said it expects to begin notifying owners of the recall by letter on April 30. The recall covers some 2010 Ford Fusion and related Mercury Milan sedans built from December 11 through February 3 in Hermosillo, Mexico, and some 2010 Ford Explorer and Mercury Mountaineer SUVs built from December 15 through February 3 in Louisville, Kentucky. The recall notice was posted on the NHTSA website within the past day. (Reporting by  David Bailey )
