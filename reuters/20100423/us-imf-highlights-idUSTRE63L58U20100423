 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Following are key quotes from global financial leaders in Washington for the IMF's annual spring meetings and Group of 20 talks. 

 JAPANESE FINANCE MINISTER NAOTO KAN On yuan: "There wasn't any talk about the yuan ... I know everyone is interested. But it wasn't discussed openly at the G7 or G20 probably because everyone there knew that China won't like that very much. There might have been discussions in other places, but at least in the official meetings it wasn't discussed." On Greece: "Japan holds a very small amount of Greek debt so any direct impact for the country will very small ... During yesterday's G7 meeting, Europe has asked for the group's show of support in case something was decided. My understanding is that they've asked for psychological support. I believe Japan should monitor the situation with the hope that those involved do their best in dealing with the situation." CHRISTIAN NOYER, EUROPEAN CEN BANK GOV. COUNCIL MEMBER "Does this destabilize the euro? No. It doesn't destabilize the euro at all. Variations in exchange rates are what they are. I note by the way that the euro is an extremely strong currency today. The euro is fundamentally a very solid currency with a central bank which has total credibility. "We are perfectly in line with the mandate given to us by the states and people of Europe. The euro remains a very solid currency, and it is quite out of the question that this will change." BRAZIL FINANCE MINISTER GUIDO MANTEGA ON REGULATION REFORMS AND BANK LEVY "We all spoke about the need to implement the reform of the global financial system. I would say there is a consensus among everyone that that should be done, and that the moment is now. "Where there is divergence is in the question of the tax. The BRICs had the same position. We think they are more appropriate for economies that had financial losses due to the action of banks or financial institutions. We did not have this. GREECE AND GROWTH "The data from the global economy shows that there will not be ... another dip in the global economy. It is recovering even better than we had expected. Greece is not big enough to threaten that process. "The problem for Brazil is above all a weakening of the U.S. dollar." CANADIAN BANKERS ASSN PRESIDENT NANCY HUGHES ANTHONY: "The fact that the G20 didn't endorse a bank levy today is good news. However, the idea is still alive and we have more work to do to make sure other options are considered. There are plenty of important issues that the G20 needs to focus on - capital and liquidity and supervision. Let's hope they roll up their sleeves and get to work on these as quickly as possible." GERMAN DEPUTY FINANCE MINISTER JOERG ASMUSSEN "Greece played a role, of course, in the discussions of the state of the global economy, because the Greek situation is a global problem. "There are clearly some common goals. Surely, among the instruments, there was a clear preference for a sort of bank levy. "I believe there is also a consensus that market participants are appropriately regulated and supervised. EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK GOVERNING COUNCIL MEMBER AXEL WEBER "Nobody questions, internationally, that the capital rules have to be changed." ARGENTINA ECONOMY MINISTER AMADO BOUDOU On bank levies: "It is a very new issue just in discussions, nothing determined on that. We have a lot of time to run that issue." "It is very difficult because it would create differences in different countries and different jurisdictions and maybe could create drastic inflows and outflows of capital." BRITISH FINANCE MINISTER ALISTAIR DARLING On a proposed bank tax: "There's an agreement we have to strike the right balance between a tougher regulatory and supervisory regime and a tax system that means banks meet their obligations to the society they operate in. There is actually more interest in a longer term tax to ensure banks meet their obligations to society. "Nobody today stood up and made a statement saying this is not going to happen, this is terrible. Absolutely nobody said that. There was widespread recognition that this is a problem. As I said, the biggest threat to stability is you forget what's happened and don't take the action you need to take. A number of people -- France, America - made the same points." On Greece: "Countries realize unless they take action quickly, confidence in their ability to resolve the Greek situation will be affected. But what they are anxious to do is to make sure they get the resolution to the problem completely. ITALIAN ECONOMY MINISTER GIULIO TREMONTI On aid to Greece: "If the house of your neighbor is on fire, even if it is a small house and, maybe, it is your neighbor's fault, you'd better not ignore the fire. You'd better use a fire extinguisher, if you have it, and we have it. "Otherwise the fire will reach your house as well, even if it is a beautiful and big house. "I am talking about Germany." SRI LANKA CENTRAL BANK GOVERNOR AJITH NIVARD CABRALL On supporting Greece: "In a global economy which is all interconnected, if any single country's having trouble, the rest of the world has to come in and support them because it's not just only one person's problem. Everyone has some kind of impact being felt if someone goes down. "If you have an epidemic, you don't only vaccinate the people who are diseased or ill. You've got to ensure that everybody is vaccinated, so that nobody really falls sick." G20 SOURCE ON THE IMF's REBALANCING GROWTH EXERCISE: "The result of this exercise is that, according to IMF, growth expectations sent by almost every country are too optimistic and there are risks that global imbalances will became more acute. "Without more coordination and changes in the national policies, global imbalances could raise again, according to IMF. "So the IMF reiterated its call for more saving in the countries with large current account deficits and more domestic spending in countries with current account surpluses, and it asked for structural reforms and reductions of public debt in countries with large debt." G20 SOURCE ON GREECE: "The request to activate aid (that has) arrived from Greece is for activating the first tranche. That would be less that the whole amount the IMF committed to give to Athens." "If everyone cooperates, the IMF could ready the cash very quickly, otherwise, if there are political discussions on the IMF executive board, the process will be longer." "There still could be discussions on the executive board." GERMAN DEPUTY FINANCE MINISTER JOERG ASMUSSEN On Greece: "The German side is ready to act with its part of the aid-package." (some 8.4 billion Euros as guaranteed credit of a public bank). "I cannot say anything about the time frame, but originally it should need some two weeks." EUROPEAN CEN. BANK GOVERNING COUNCIL MEMBER EWALD NOWOTNY On aid to Greece: "The official process has started. It always takes some time until money is really flowing. It should not take too long. "The assistance for Greece should be a signal to markets and speculators that it is not realistic to attack other countries. "The fiscal situation of, let's say, Spain and Portugal, cannot be compared with the situation of Greece. FRENCH ECONOMY MINISTER CHRISTINE LAGARDE ON FRANCE'S CONTRIBUTION TO GREEK AID "The process is under way. It has been activated. Everybody has to do their homework now." SPANISH ECONOMY MINISTER ELENA SALGADO ON SPAIN'S CONTRIBUTION TO GREEK AID PACKAGE "I think the most important thing is that the IMF has clearly said that Spain is not in the same situation as Greece."
