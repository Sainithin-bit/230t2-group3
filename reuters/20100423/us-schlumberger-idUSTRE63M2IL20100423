 NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Schlumberger Ltd ( SLB.N ), the world's largest oilfield services company, posted a profit that edged out market forecasts and forecast a quicker industry recovery outside North America, sending its stock up 6.6 percent. 

 Firmer oil prices attracted renewed interest in projects outside North America and margins were rebounding sooner than expected, Chairman and Chief Executive Andrew Gould said. "International margins appear to have bottomed and are likely to resume a positive trend from now on -- absent any exceptional circumstances," Gould said. He said oil above $80 a barrel would loosen purse strings for his clients' engineers who want to pay more for better technology, likening it to the "difference between a cheap bottle of wine and being able to afford a good bottle of wine." Gould's take on the global oil and gas industry is watched closely because of Schlumberger's size and knowledge of the plans of so many leading energy companies, and a few analysts remarked on his positive change in tone. "The shift to a more bullish stance will be welcomed by investors as it confirms that we are in another upcycle," BMO Capital Markets analyst Alan Laws said. Schlumberger, whose planned $11.3 billion purchase of peer Smith International SII.N is awaiting approval by antitrust regulators, said U.S. natural gas drilling should remain active in the second quarter. Strong drilling activity in natural gas fields such as the Haynesville and Marcellus shales has helped bolster earnings across the oilfield services sector this year. But uncertainty about U.S. gas prices could curtail producers' drilling programs, creating a cloudy picture in the company's biggest market. First-quarter net income fell 28 percent to $672 million, or 56 cents per share, from $938 million, or 78 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time charges, earnings per share were 62 cents, just above the 61 cents analysts had forecast, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue fell 7 percent to $5.6 billion, slightly below the $5.69 billion analysts had forecast. In addition to its planned Smith acquisition, Schlumberger bought France's Geoservices for just over $1 billion in March. But Gould signaled an end to the flurry of activity, Schlumberger saying its acquisition plans would now be "severely restrained." CAPEX HIKE Oil prices, which have retreated by about 6 percent after reaching a peak near $87 earlier this month, were helping to support a rebound in spending by energy producers who had slashed budgets last year. As a result, Schlumberger said it would hike its spending by $400 million this year, mostly for drilling and measurements operations, to prepare for increased offshore activity in the North Sea, Latin America and West Africa as well as onshore Russia. The company's WesternGeco unit, which sells seismic services to help locate new oil and gas reservoirs, will likely see increased activity, but with new capacity coming on line, price gains would be held in check until later this year. On Monday, Schlumberger's nearest competitor, Halliburton Co ( HAL.N ), posted better-than-expected profits, helped by an unexpected North American boost, though it said future growth would come out of the Eastern Hemisphere. Smaller rival Weatherford Ltd ( WFT.N ) told a similar story when it reported results the following day. Schlumberger shares rose 6.6 percent to $72.69, around levels not seen for 18 months.
