 MILAN  (Reuters) - Ratings agency Standard & Poor's, under investigation in Italy for alleged market manipulation and abuse of privileged information, on Tuesday rejected allegations that its decision to cut Italy's rating was based on incorrect information. 
 It also dismissed as groundless suggestions that its controlling shareholders had access to ratings data and reports before they were released in the public domain. (Reporting by Michel Rose)
