 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bed Bath & Beyond ( BBBY.O ) beat quarterly profit and sales estimates and boosted its full-year view as U.S. consumers spent more on their homes, sending its shares up 5.5 percent. 

 The news came just days after rival Pier 1 Imports Inc ( PIR.N ) posted its fourth consecutive quarterly profit after years of losses in the housing downturn. Larger rival Williams-Sonoma Inc ( WSM.N ) also posted higher-than-expected, second-quarter earnings and raised its third-quarter forecast. On a conference call, the company's co-chairman, Warren Eisenberg, said he was "cautiously optimistic" about the remainder of the year. For fiscal 2010, the company now sees net earnings per share rising by about 20 percent, up from its prior forecast of a 15 percent rise. But the company chose to temper investor optimism by underscoring factors like unemployment that could weigh on future spending. "While the economic environment appears to have stabilized, it looks as if the consumer continues to face challenges as a result of the macroeconomic environment," he said. For the third quarter, the company sees earnings of 61 cents to 65 cents a share. Analysts were looking for earnings of 64 cents a share in that period. Sales at home goods retailers crumbled in the housing downturn and recession as consumers tried to save money by buying only essential items. Consumers are showing a renewed interest to freshen up their homes after a long hiatus. Some analysts tied the trend to consumers choosing to spend more time at home to save money in an uncertain economy. Bed Bath & Beyond, which sells items ranging from furniture to toasters, has also gained from the bankruptcy of former rival Linens 'n Things. Its recent efforts to cross-merchandise among the company's different concepts, add more fine china gift departments to the bridal business and introduce new products have also helped it to win shoppers. The operator of the Bed Bath & Beyond, Christmas Tree Shops, Harmon and buybuy Baby chains, said sales at stores open at least a year rose 7.4 percent. Net income rose to $181.8 million, or 70 cents a share, in the fiscal second quarter ended August 28, from $135.5 million, or 52 cents a share, a year ago. Analysts, on average, were expecting a profit of 63 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales rose about 11.6 percent to $2.14 billion, beating the analysts' average estimate of about $2.10 billion. Bed Bath & Beyond's stock was up 5.5 percent to $44.37 after hours, after closing at $42.05 on Nasdaq. (Reporting by Dhanya Skariachan; Editing by  Gary Hill , Carol Bishopric and  Leslie Gevirtz )
