 FRANKFURT/MILAN  (Reuters) - Italian carmaker Fiat said it was looking at cooperation opportunities on Wednesday after a newspaper said its German rival Daimler was interested in its industrial arm. 

 Italian newspaper La Repubblica said the German luxury car and commercial truckmaker was interested in buying Fiat's industrial unit when it is spun off and listed in January. Daimler denied it was in talks on such a deal. One analyst said only the truck operations of Fiat's Iveco unit, with 7.2 billion euros ($9.57 billion) in sales, would fit with Daimler, so it would end up with much that it did not want, making a deal improbable. The report said Daimler had offered 9 billion euros ($12 billion) for the Fiat Industrial assets this summer but that Fiat wanted 10.5 billion euros. Fiat did not directly deny the newspaper report but said it was normal business to look at growth opportunities for its various operations. "The group reviews opportunities to enhance operational synergies and access to new markets through potential cooperations of varied nature with other international manufacturers for each of its businesses," it said. The largest business within Fiat Industrial is Case New Holland, with over 10 billion euros in annual revenue. The U.S.-listed unit makes both tractors and combines for the agriculture sector as well as bulldozers, loaders and excavators for use in construction -- none of which Daimler manufactures. The industrial and marine businesses of off-road engine maker Fiat Powertrain Technologies (FPT), which generates about 3.4 billion in sales, is also included in the division. Daimler is only indirectly involved in the sector through its 25 percent stake in Tognum. Analysts say Daimler would only go for the whole of Industrial if it had buyers lined up for CNH and the FPT activities. EVERYONE TALKING TO EVERYONE Shares in Fiat bucked a 1.5 percent decline in the European auto sector, edging up 0.1 percent by the close of trading, while Daimler fell 1.7 percent. Though the Stuttgart-based group said it was not in talks to buy the division, that leaves plenty of room open for further speculation about a different tie-up. "It's no secret that everyone talks with everyone in this industry," a Daimler spokesman said. "But there are no talks with Fiat on this subject." Metzler analyst Juergen Pieper failed to see the logic of a deal. "They would need to sell off the rest of Fiat Industrial just to get at Iveco -- an awful lot of effort to go through, considering the truck business is not a particularly attractive asset. Nor are the chances high that antitrust regulators would approve a deal," he said. Germany's monthly Manager Magazin reported on Wednesday that Daimler Trucks chief Andreas Renschler had been in Italy for "negotiations" over the acquisition of Iveco. Daimler declined comment on the magazine report. (Writing by Danilo Masoni, additional reporting by Ian Simpson in Milan; Editing by Mike Nesbit and Will Waterman) ($1=.7523 euros)
