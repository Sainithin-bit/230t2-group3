 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs wants to sell its stake in Primo Japan Inc, a Japanese retailer of diamond rings, and is seeking bids of as much as 10 billion yen ($118 million), four people with direct knowledge of the transaction told Reuters. 

 The U.S. bank has hired Deloitte Tohmatsu FAS to arrange the sale, said the sources on condition of anonymity because the sale is not yet public. The move comes after Goldman last month sold Teibow Co, a maker of felt pen nibs, to Japanese private equity firm Wise Partners for as much as 15 billion yen. Goldman bought 67 percent of Primo Japan in 2007 and 86 percent of Teibow in 2006 through its Asia Special Situations Group, a team it formed to acquire debt-ridden companies. The group, which has also bought Japanese golf courses and hotels, was later merged with Goldman's real estate and corporate investment teams. Goldman now owns 47 percent of Primo Japan, while Japanese fund manager Risa Partners owns 26 percent. The remainder is held by various entities including Hikari Tsushin and Usen Corp. Goldman declined to say how much it paid for its stake in Primo Japan. Primo Japan's other shareholders are also expected to sell their holdings when Goldman offloads its stake, the sources told Reuters. A Tokyo-based spokeswoman for Goldman declined to comment on the planned sale. (Reporting by  Junko Fujita ; Editing by  Chris Gallagher )
