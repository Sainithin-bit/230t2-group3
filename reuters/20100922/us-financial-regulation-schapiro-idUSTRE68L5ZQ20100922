 WASHINGTON/NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The top securities regulator says the new market for swaps trading would benefit from the "competition, access, liquidity and transparency" already established in the cash equities market. 

 Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Schapiro's comments on Wednesday gave an early indication of how her agency wants to construct a derivatives market that will be under far more scrutiny in the wake of the 2007-2009 financial crisis. "As it takes shape over time, we will be working to embed into the security-based swap market the broad principles that have brought important benefits to the equities market," Schapiro said at a Security Traders Association conference in Washington. The SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission are responsible for implementing new rules for the derivatives market set out in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform bill, passed this summer. The regulators will need to decide how to define so-called swap execution facilities, or SEFs, and how the new market will function once far more of the complex products are forced through transparent venues and clearinghouses. The legislation ramps up oversight of the $615 trillion over-the-counter derivatives market and saddles banks with additional regulations. Last week, CFTC Chairman Gary Gensler said 20 to 30 new entities were likely to register as SEFs or designated contract markets. This week, Gensler said real-time reporting of swaps trades could begin as early as September. In her first public comments on SEFs, Schapiro told the conference: "Closely related to access is the question of how to structure SEF operations to maximize transparency and competition, and thus liquidity. "One way to promote these goals is to provide for greater pre-trade transparency of trading interest, while at the same time encouraging greater participation by market participants willing to provide liquidity. "Any trading systems intended to qualify as SEFs should support these goals," she added. The SEC is also tackling problems in the stock market, after the May "flash crash" rattled investors. Schapiro said the SEC is carefully considering whether new rules are needed to govern high-frequency quoting and trading strategies. Regulators have grown concerned about strange surges in quote traffic, or the buy and sell orders for stocks, with firms that use high-speed algorithms to make rapid trades specifically under the microscope. "Given their volume and access, high-frequency trading firms have a tremendous capacity to affect the stability and integrity of the equity markets," Schapiro said. Regulators are expected to issue a follow up report on the flash crash next week. (Reporting by Jonathan Spicer in New York and Rachelle Younglai in Washington; editing by Gerald E.
