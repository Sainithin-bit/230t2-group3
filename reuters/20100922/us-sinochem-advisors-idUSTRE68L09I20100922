 HONG KONG/NEW YORK  (Reuters) - China's Sinochem Corp has hired Deutsche Bank AG and Citigroup Inc to advise on a possible move to foil BHP Billiton Plc's $39 billion bid to take over Potash Corp, sources with direct knowledge of the matter said. 

 The Chinese state-owned chemicals group had not yet decided whether it would proceed with a formal bid and was exploring potential options, one of the sources said. China typically buys about 7 percent of the output of Potash Corp, the world's largest fertilizer maker. It fears a BHP takeover might push up the cost of the crop nutrient, crucial to boosting food production for its huge population. That has fed speculation that a major state-owned Chinese company might try to stymie BHP's bid with a rival offer or by buying a blocking stake in Potash Corp. Market talk has centered on Sinochem. Chinese officials have ordered state-owned companies to meet investment bankers to explore options. Sinochem has approached Singapore's Temasek Holdings to join a consortium that may make a bid, sources have told Reuters. The sources were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter and declined to be named. (Reporting by  Joseph Chaney  in Hong Kong and  Michael Erman  in New York; Editing by Chris Lewis)
