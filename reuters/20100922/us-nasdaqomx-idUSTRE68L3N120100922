 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Nasdaq OMX Group Inc ( NDAQ.O ) boosted its short-term cost expectations on Wednesday, but outlined the longer-term growth it expects in the clearing and technology businesses -- areas on which the exchange operator will lean in coming years. 

 Nasdaq OMX, like rivals, has expanded beyond its core stock and data business to include options, commodities, clearinghouses and global deals to provide market technology. In slides accompanying an analysts update Wednesday, the company said it expects $882 million to $898 million in total operating expenses this fiscal year, up from a July estimate of $870 million to $885 million. The increase is due in large part to $12 million to $13 million in incremental run rate expenses from this year's acquisition of SMARTS Group, a provider of surveillance technology, the company said. Overall technology-based annual revenues could reach $200 million by 2014, according to a company target. Nasdaq OMX sees "significant growth opportunities" in the Asia-Pacific area and expects 51 percent of 2012 technology revenue to come from this region. Clearing is a nascent business for Nasdaq OMX, but one that in general is expected to expand after the financial crisis yielded new laws for derivatives. The company aims to double clearing-related revenues by 2014 and is considering entering the U.S. carbon trading and clearing business, it said. Nasdaq OMX announced on Tuesday a joint venture to clear U.S.-based power and natural gas products. The company also completed $300 million of a planned $400 million authorized share buyback as of September 1 and it expects no further purchases prior to announcing quarterly earnings in the fall, it added.
