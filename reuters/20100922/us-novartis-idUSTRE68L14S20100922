 ZURICH  (Reuters) - Swiss drugmaker Novartis AG's ( NOVN.VX ) multiple sclerosis pill Gilenya won U.S. approval, making it the first oral treatment for the ailment in the United States and weighing on rival drugmakers. 

 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's approval for broad use of Gilenya to treat U.S. patients with relapsing MS, the most common form of the often debilitating disease, hit Biogen Idec Inc ( BIIB.O ), whose existing treatments, Tysabri and Avonex, involve less convenient infusions or injections. The FDA decision also put Novartis ahead of German rival Merck KGaA ( MRCG.DE ), which is seeking approval for a competing oral medication. Biogen shares fell nearly 6 percent, while Merck shed more than 2 percent on Wednesday. "Many investors were anticipating a potential delay or a more restrictive label for the drug," RBC Capital Markets analyst Jason Kantor said, noting the FDA's recent history of being cautious with new drugs. The lack of restrictions for Gilenya and on-time approval positions the Novartis product for a good launch and bodes poorly for Biogen, which relies heavily on sales from its MS treatments Avonex and Tysabri, Kantor said. An RBC survey from June found that 75 percent of doctors would prescribe Gilenya before Tysabri. Gilenya is one of Novartis's biggest drug hopes and the news could further lift sentiment in the stock, which has gained in recent weeks as investors focus on its promising pipeline and expect it to wrap up its buyout of Alcon Inc ACL.N. Brokerage Jefferies said in a note the broad label approval for Gilenya means it should generate peak sales of around $3.5 billion, well above current consensus expectations pegged under $2 billion. A Novartis spokesman said the group was looking to make Gilenya available in coming weeks. The disabling neurological condition can cause dizziness, fatigue, blurred or double vision and cognitive problems and affects 2.1 million people worldwide. "Gilenya's FDA approval as first-line treatment and first oral medicine against MS is very, very good news," one trader said. But the upside for Novartis stock was capped by a Goldman Sachs downgrade and Roche Holding AG ( ROG.VX ) shares being added to the bank's "conviction buy" list. "This could lead to some switches," the trader said. Novartis shares closed down 1.8 percent, trailing Roche stock, which closed 0.8 percent lower, and slightly underperforming the European healthcare index, which finished down 1.4 percent..SXDP MULTIBILLION DOLLAR MARKET Goldman said Novartis, which is trading at a premium to Roche, could see cash returns fall this year due to the Alcon investment, while margins could face pressure from 2012 with patent expiration of blood pressure drug Diovan. The MS market could be worth $13 billion by 2015 and Gilenya could capture as much as 20 percent five years after launch, Helvea analyst Karl-Heinz Koch said, adding Novartis currently has about 0.5 percent of the market with drug Extavia. Only injectable drugs are currently on offer to treat MS, with the main treatments offered by Biogen, Bayer AG ( BAYGn.DE ), Novartis, and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd ( TEVA.TA ) TEVA.O. The latter's U.S.-listed stock was down 1.2 percent. Other competing MS pills in development include Teva's laquinimod, teriflunomide from Sanofi-Aventis SA ( SASY.PA ) and BG-12 from Biogen. Offering a pill for MS could win over some of the 40 percent of MS patients who do not currently receive therapy and who may be put off by painful injections and the flu-like symptoms associated with some existing drugs. Another oral drug, Ampyra from Acorda Therapeutics Inc ( ACOR.O ), won approval in January for improving walking ability. Novartis has received backing for the drug in Russia, but was pipped to the post by Merck's cladribine in this market. The latter's drug was seen gaining on Gilenya when the FDA accepted Merck's reworked request for the drug in July. A decision on cladribine in Europe could come as early as this week, while the European Medicines Agency review of Gilenya is expected before the end of the year. "With the outright approval of Gilenya, we believe that the last negative catalyst for the next 12 months has passed," Vontobel analyst Andrew Weiss said. Weiss upgraded Novartis to "buy" on the Gilenya decision, more positive outlooks for leukemia drug Tasigna and gout treatment Ilaris, and the potential to resolve the Alcon deal.
