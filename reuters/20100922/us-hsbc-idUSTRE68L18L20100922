 LONDON  (Reuters) - HSBC Holdings Plc ( HSBA.L ) ( 0005.HK ) Chief Executive Michael Geoghegan has threatened to quit if he is not promoted to chairman, a report said on Wednesday, potentially adding to a spate of upheavals within Europe's top banks. 

 Europe's biggest bank is expected to decide at a board meeting in Shanghai next week on a replacement for Chairman Stephen Green, who will quit to become Britain's trade and investment minister in January. Geoghegan was "not happy" when he was told at a meeting last week that the board was not ready to give him the chairmanship, the Financial Times said, quoting a person familiar with the bank's succession planning. People close to Geoghegan said he might not follow through on his threat to leave, the FT said. HSBC said it expects to approve a successor by the end of the year. It declined to comment further. By 0823 GMT HSBC shares were down 1.1 percent at 663.6 pence. HSBC has a history of promoting its CEO to the chairmanship, but when Green made that move five years ago it angered many investors, who said it went against best corporate practice. Critics say it is hard for a former CEO to be objective about strategic decisions he or she had made. A top 10 shareholder in HSBC said on Wednesday: "We would prefer an independent non-executive chairman. However we believe there should be more flexibility ... where it is clear that senior management needs to have a very firm grasp of the breadth of activity of what can be a very complex business. "So from our point of view, if the board made a good case to us for a CEO becoming a chairman, we would listen and (be) willing to be receptive," the shareholder said. FRONT RUNNERS HSBC has long prided itself on its smooth succession plans, but it has been scrambling to pick its next chairman since Green announced on September 7 he would leave. Geoghegan, as well as former Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) banker and HSBC non-executive director John Thornton, were considered front runners to succeed Green. Both have a wealth of experience of China, and Asia more broadly, and an inside track on the complex and far-reaching financial services group. Other leading names in the frame to succeed Green are internal candidates, including Simon Robertson, another non-executive; Vincent Cheng, chairman of HSBC Bank (China); and Douglas Flint, finance director. Geoghegan's reported threat to quit, if accurate, would come at a time of dramatic change at the top of European banks. Lloyds ( LLOY.L ) and Unicredit ( CRDI.MI ) this week began searches for new chief executives after their long-standing CEOs quit, and Barclays ( BARC.L ) has changed its chief executive.
