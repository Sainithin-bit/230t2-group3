 DETROIT  (Reuters) - U.S. auto sales were running at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of about 12.7 million units in July, based on a calculation by Reuters from sales data released on Friday by automakers representing over 80 percent of the market. 

 The seasonally adjusted annual rate, or SAAR, is a closely tracked indicator of auto industry demand. Sales results included the top six automakers in the U.S. market: General Motors Corp, Toyota Motor Corp, Ford Motor Co, Chrysler LLC, Honda Motor Co Ltd and Nissan Motor Co Ltd. Taken together, the six automakers represented 80.5 percent of the overall U.S. light vehicle sales in June. (Reporting by  David Bailey , editing by Leslie Gevirtz)
