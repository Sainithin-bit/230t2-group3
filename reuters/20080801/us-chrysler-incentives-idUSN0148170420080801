 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Chrysler LLC CBS.UL said on Friday it is raising incentives on most vehicles, starting immediately, to offset the exit from the leasing business by its finance arm, Chrysler Financial. 

 Chrysler will offer an additional $2,000 cash back on vehicle purchases in addition to existing incentives, when financed through Chrysler Financial, and offer 72-month finance deals on an expanded range of vehicles. Existing zero-percent financing for six years on some models, including the Jeep Grand Cherokee and the Jeep Commander, are extended by another month through the end of August, the company said. Chrysler also said that returning lease customers would receive $750 to use for purchasing a new vehicle. "We're leveraging the move from leasing to retail purchases to offer customers the best deals of the year and make buying as affordable as renting," Chrysler President Jim Press said in a statement. The sweetened incentives came a week after Chrysler Financial said it would stop financing vehicle leases from August because of tumbling resale values of large trucks and SUVs. Bigger rivals General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) and Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) also announced cutbacks on leasing programs this week in response to tighter credit and the plunging resale prices of the large vehicles. A sharp decline in the resale value of gasoline-hungry trucks and SUVs has forced major automakers and related lenders to take large losses to write down the value of leases on those once-popular vehicles.
