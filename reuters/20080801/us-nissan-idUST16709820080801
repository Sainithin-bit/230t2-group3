 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co ( 7201.T ) posted a much-worse-than-expected 46 percent drop in quarterly operating profit on Friday due to a severe downturn in the U.S. market, but stuck to its annual forecasts, counting on a weaker yen. 

 Nissan, controlled by Renault SA ( RENA.PA ), is already forecasting its lowest operating profit in seven years due to a weaker dollar, high raw material prices and sinking U.S. demand. Analysts think a downward revision will follow eventually, as a sales slowdown in the United States, Nissan's biggest market, has deepened in recent months due to a collapse in demand for gas-guzzling vehicles. That forced Nissan, Japan's No.3 automaker, to take a provision of 42 billion yen ($390 million) in the April-June quarter as resale values slide for vehicles in its leasing business. Leasing accounts for just over one-fifth of Nissan's U.S. sales volume. Nissan's first-quarter operating profit fell to 79.95 billion yen, against an average estimate of 101.9 billion yen in a Reuters poll of nine brokerages. Net profit fell 43 percent to 52.8 billion yen on revenues of 2.347 trillion yen, down 4.1 percent. "This really isn't very good," said Takeshi Osawa, a senior fund manager at Norinchukin Zenkyoren Asset Management. "And given the way the market is at present -- responding very quickly to bad news -- it is likely to spark (share) selling," he said, adding that the chance of a profit warning would likely rise as the year progresses. Mitsushige Akino, chief fund manager for Ichiyoshi Investment Management, said he expected a downward revision in the annual outlook in three months' time. "The market in North America is difficult, and unless there are huge changes in oil prices or exchange rates, it's only going to get more difficult," he said. "I was expecting a downward revision from Nissan, so I was slightly surprised." For the year to the end of March 2009, Nissan kept its forecast for an operating profit of 550 billion yen and net profit of 340 billion yen, both down 30 percent from last year. It kept its assumptions for the dollar and euro to average 100 yen and 155 yen this year, against current rates of around 107 yen and 167 yen. Nissan says every 1 yen change in the dollar affects its operating profit by 14.5 billion yen. Consensus forecasts from 18 brokerages call for an operating profit of 586 billion yen and net profit of 364 billion yen. RESIDUAL VALUE -- NEW INDUSTRY HEADACHE In the past few months, the resale value of big, used cars has fallen as consumers seek fuel efficiency, dropping by as much as 30 percent in the latest quarter from the year before. About 30 percent of Nissan's U.S. sales are in light trucks. Even rival Honda Motor Co ( 7267.T ), whose model line-up is dominated by smaller cars, last week set aside an additional allowance of 25 billion yen this year on such writedowns. "A further decline of used vehicle values in the United States remains a risk, but so far a weaker-than-assumed yen exceeds that comfortably so we're keeping our forecasts intact," Corporate Vice President Joji Tagawa told a news conference. Plunging resale prices for light trucks such as SUVs prompted Chrysler LLC's CBS.UL decision last week to stop offering vehicle leases -- which rely on a healthy resale value for a vehicle when a lease ends to make a profit. Bigger rival Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) took a $2.1 billion charge for its finance company when it reported second-quarter results, while General Motors Corp's ( GM.N ) finance arm took a $716 million write-down on North American vehicle leases. Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn last week forecast U.S. industry sales of 14.3 million vehicles in 2008, the lowest level in more than a decade. Global vehicle sales grew 6.9 percent in the first quarter thanks to brisk sales of the Qashqai compact SUV, known as the Dualis in some markets, and the launch of new models, including the Livina series. But Nissan, like many of its rivals, faces falling demand for gas-guzzling vehicles and has been forced to significantly reduce production of light trucks. Underscoring the severity of the U.S. market, Nissan this week said it would seek to axe 1,200 workers at two plants in Tennessee, about one-fifth of its headcount. It is operating far below capacity in North America as sales of pickups and other big vehicles slump. Shares of Nissan have fallen 32 percent in the year to date, worse than Tokyo's transport sub-index .ITEQP.T, which has lost 21 percent. Before the results, Nissan ended down 1.4 percent at 828 yen.
