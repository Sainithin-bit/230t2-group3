 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) on Friday reported a 27 percent drop in U.S. July vehicle sales, hurt by high fuel prices, a challenging U.S. economy and shortages of compact cars. 

 Adjusting for the two extra selling days last month compared to the same month a year earlier, GM reported a sales decline of 32.4 percent. Overall, GM sales of light trucks in July declined 40 percent while car sales fell 19 percent on an adjusted basis. (Reporting by  Poornima Gupta , editing by Phil Berlowitz)
