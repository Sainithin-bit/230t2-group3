 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp's benchmark long bonds traded at a record low on Friday after the automaker posted a worse-than-expected $15.5 billion quarterly loss. 

 GM's 8.375 percent bonds due in 2033 dipped to 46 cents on the dollar, an all-time low in the institutional market, before bouncing to 47 cents, according to MarketAxess. They closed on Thursday at 49 cents. GM burned through $3.6 billion in cash in the second quarter as it ran down inventory of slower-selling vehicles in its slumping home market.
