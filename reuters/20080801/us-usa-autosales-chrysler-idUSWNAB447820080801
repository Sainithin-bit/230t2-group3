 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Chrysler LLC said on Friday U.S. sales fell 29 percent to 98,109 vehicles, hurt by decline in demand for pickup trucks and SUVs and reductions in fleet sales. 

 The automaker said it had 409,331 vehicles of inventory, or a 108-day supply, at the end of July. (Reporting by  Poornima Gupta , editing by Leslie Gevirtz)
