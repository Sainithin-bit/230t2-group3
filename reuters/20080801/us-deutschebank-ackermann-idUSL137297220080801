 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ) Chief Executive Josef Ackermann thinks difficult market conditions have made it harder for banks to do large acquisitions, he said in a New York Times interview published on Friday. 

 While he would not comment directly on a possible takeover bid for Deutsche Postbank ( DPBGn.DE ), Germany's largest retail bank, the newspaper said he seemed to signal that this was unlikely. "The current environment is not particularly intriguing. It's more challenging to make a deal and explain it to our shareholders," he was quoted as saying. Deutsche Bank on Thursday reiterated it was interested in principle in takeovers but would not do deals at any price. It lost out to French bank Credit Mutuel, for instance, in the contest to buy Citigroup's ( C.N ) German retail banking business. Deutsche Post ( DPWGn.DE ) has for weeks been in talks with potential suitors for its majority stake in Postbank, but has not struck a deal so far. Sources familiar with the situation say Deutsche Bank is among the interested parties along with Banco Santander ( SAN.MC ) and ING ( ING.AS ). One main issue is the valuation of Postbank, whose market capitalization has fallen to around 7.6 billion euros. This is well below the sale price above 10 billion euros that the sources say had been floated just a few weeks ago. (Reporting by  Jonathan Gould  and  Philipp Halstrick )
