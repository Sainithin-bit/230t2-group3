 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - United Technologies Corp's ( UTX.N ) Pratt & Whitney unit and its supplier will pay $52 million to settle allegations they knowingly sold defective parts for military fighter jets, the U.S. Department of Justice said on Friday. 

 The case centered on turbine blade replacements for jet engines designed by Pratt & Whitney and used in twin-engine F-15s and single-engine F-16s operated by the U.S. Air Force. The blades, cast by a subcontractor, a unit of Precision Castparts Corp ( PCP.N ), had a defect that caused the crash of an F-16 fighter jet in Arizona in 2003, the Justice Department said in a statement. The pilot ejected safely. Pratt & Whitney will pay $45.5 million and provide $4.8 million in services reinspecting engine blades bought by the Air Force, the statement said. Precision Castparts will pay $2 million. Both companies previously took corrective action, which the government valued at $47.1 million. The Air Force had not identified any future safety concerns, the department said. Jay DeFrank, a spokesman for Pratt & Whitney, said the company believed the Justice Department allegations were unfounded but agreed to a settlement to avoid "lengthy and protracted litigation with an important customer." He stressed that the settlement was not an admission of liability, adding, "Pratt & Whitney took voluntary and immediate actions to remedy a problem suffered by our customer. We do not agree with the DOJ allegations." DeFrank said the company voluntarily provided 54,000 replacement blades to the Air Force and 42,000 blades to other customers as soon as the problem was identified. The company also inspected tens of thousands of parts to ensure that none of the estimated 3,000 engines in the field were at risk. Separately, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio ruled on Friday that Pratt & Whitney must pay a $7 million fine for submitting inflated cost estimates on Air Force orders dating back to 1985 through 1990. The court said the company did not have to pay $624 million in damages sought by the federal government in its lawsuit dating back to 1999 since the U.S. Air Force never actually paid the higher charges. "Pratt & Whitney is reviewing the opinion carefully and hopes this decision will bring an end to almost nine years of litigation over events that occurred almost 25 years ago," DeFrank said. He said he was unaware of any current Justice Department investigations involving Pratt & Whitney. Last summer, the company encountered problems with engine blades it is building for the Short Takeoff Vertical Landing version of the Lockheed Martin Corp ( LMT.N ) F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, but it has developed a remedy. DeFrank said the company and the F-35 program office were preparing for a series of ground engine tests ahead of a flight test in the fourth quarter of 2008.
