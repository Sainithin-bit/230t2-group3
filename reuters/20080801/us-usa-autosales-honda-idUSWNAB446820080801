 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co Ltd ( 7267.T ) said on Friday that U.S. auto sales fell an adjusted 9.2 percent in July to 138,744 units as an increase in car sales was more than offset by a sharp decrease in light truck sales. 

 Honda brand car sales rose an adjusted 6.7 percent to 82,976 vehicles in July, while Honda brand truck sales fell 27.8 percent to 42,940 vehicles. Figures were adjusted for two additional selling days in July compared with a year earlier. (Reporting by  David Bailey , editing by Phil Berlowitz)
