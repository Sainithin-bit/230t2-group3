 LONDON  (Reuters) - U.S bank JPMorgan ( JPM.N ) said on Friday that it has agreed plans to set up its new European headquarters in London's Canary Wharf financial district. 

 The proposed building, which will be developed by Canary Wharf Group, will be located at Canary Riverside South and will enable JPMorgan to achieve a long-term ambition to consolidate existing London offices at one site, a statement said. Earlier on Friday, UK real estate investment trust Hammerson ( HMSO.L ) said JPMorgan had pulled out of negotiations to occupy a proposed bespoke building in London's City financial district.
