 LONDON  (Reuters) - Britain's financial watchdog has found no evidence that illegal dealing was behind an abrupt fall in the shares of mortgage lender HBOS HBOS.L in March, but warned it would not relax its surveillance of the market. 

 Britain's biggest provider of home loans saw its shares abruptly plunge more than 17 percent to a record low on March 19 following a flurry of rumors in a market unsettled by the weekend rescue of U.S. bank Bear Stearns. The drop prompted an unusual intervention by British regulators, still smarting from criticism of their failures over Northern Rock, who vowed they would probe the share price moves. In its report concluded on Friday, however, the Financial Services Authority said it had not been able to show how much impact the rumors had, given broader worries on the day, and said it had not uncovered evidence they were spread as part of a concerted effort to manipulate the share price. "Despite the likelihood that the rumors contributed to the fall in the share price, the FSA has not uncovered evidence that they were spread as part of a concerted attempt by individuals to profit by manipulating the share price," it said. The failure to uncover a "smoking gun" is likely to prompt fresh criticism of the FSA's ability to prosecute high-profile cases that may involve insider dealing and market abuse, despite a hardened stance on financial crime. The FSA said it spoke to "a number" of market participants at banks, broker dealers and hedge funds, scrutinized trading records and reviewed emails and messages during its probe. "There is no doubt that false and damaging rumors were circulating about HBOS on 19 March 2008 and these would have had some impact on HBOS' share price," the watchdog said in a statement. "It is difficult, however, to say how much impact, as the share price was also affected by the interaction of a number of other complex factors on the day." These included a lack of liquidity and the effect of algorithmic trading strategies which amplified the drop. The FSA warned, however, that it would continue to react quickly to market abuse, even if it does not always uncover evidence and if probes do not lead to fines or prosecution. It said firms or individuals found to have benefited from rumors would have to provide immediate access to traders, information, trading strategies as well as email, messaging and telephone records. The FSA is separately reviewing companies' systems and controls for dealing with rumors. The results of that investigation are due in the early autumn.
