 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Defense contractor General Dynamics Corp ( GD.N ) reported a higher quarterly profit on Wednesday, aided by improved revenue and margins in its business jet segment, and the company forecast higher per-share profit for this year. 

 The maker of ships, tanks and Gulfstream jets said net earnings came to $729 million, or $1.91 a share, for the fourth quarter, compared with $614 million, or $1.57 a share, a year earlier. (Reporting by  Karen Jacobs , editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
