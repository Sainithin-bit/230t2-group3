 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Lowe's Cos Inc ( LOW.N ), the country's second-largest home-improvement chain, is laying off about 1,700 middle managers nationwide, the Associated Press reported on Tuesday. 

 The retailer will also add thousands of hourly, part-time sales staff for weekends, the report also said, adding that applications to fill the 8,000 to 10,000 new jobs will be taken starting next week. The report also said that about 20 percent of Lowe's stores would not lose staff. Officials for Lowe's could not be reached for comment. (Reporting by  Martinne Geller )
