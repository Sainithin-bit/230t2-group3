 SEOUL  (Reuters) - South Korea's LG Electronics Inc had been approached to consider buying U.S. airconditioner maker Goodman Global but it is not considering making an offer for the company, an LG executive said on Wednesday. 

 "We've been approached but not interested in the deal," Park Jung-hwan, an executive at LG's airconditioning division, told Reuters. "We are always open to acquisitions but that (Goodman) is not something we are interested," Park said. Japanese air conditioner maker Daikin Industries said this month it was considering buying Goodman Global among other acquisition targets in what could be a $4 billion deal. San Francisco-based private equity firm Hellman & Friedman has put Goodman on the auction block and contacted a number of potential bidders, including Daikin, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters last month.
