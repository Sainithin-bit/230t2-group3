 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) is recalling about 525,000 older model Windstar minivans in cold-weather areas because corrosion could cause a separation of parts under the vans that might reduce steering control, company and federal government officials said on Wednesday. 

 About 425,000 of the Windstars are registered in the United States, about 100,000 in Canada, and fewer than 750 in other countries, Ford said. Ford said it is aware of seven reported accidents with five minor injuries in which drivers claim the corrosion-related issue was a contributing factor. Model year 1999 to 2003 Windstar minivans are affected. In the United States, minivans in 22 states and the District of Columbia will be recalled, according to the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. NHTSA said it received 87 complaints of corrosion-related failures of the front frame and that Ford had received 74 unique incident reports as of last month. Ford said it would notify owners of the Windstars beginning in mid-February to bring their vehicles to dealerships for inspection and possible repair, if necessary.
