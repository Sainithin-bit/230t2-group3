 SAO PAULO  (Reuters) - Shares of JBS, the world's biggest meat company, fell more than 2 percent on Wednesday on concern that it would need to offer more debt or shares to buy U.S. food company Sara Lee Corp SLE.N. 

 Shares of Sara Lee, meanwhile, fell 2.7 percent after the New York Post reported that the company had rejected a separate bid from private equity firms Apollo Management APOLO.UL, Bain Capital and TPG Capital TPG.UL. Sara Lee, which makes Hillshire Farm meats, Senseo coffee and a host of other packaged foods, has been in sale talks for a couple of months. Reuters reported on Tuesday that JBS made a verbal buyout offer for Sara Lee. Bloomberg News reported that JBS had indicated the bid would be around $21 a share. That would value Sara Lee at about $13.4 billion, based on the shares ourstanding for the company at the end of its most recently reported quarter. Such a price "would be a lot of money," said Rafael Dornaus, a stock trader with brokerage Hencorp Commcor in Sao Paulo. "Even as JBS has partners in this bid, the question is whether more debt and share sales are on the way to fund this deal." The JBS-led group includes buyout giant Blackstone Group ( BX.N ). Sara Lee's market value of about $12.5 billion could at this point be too much for JBS to swallow, Dornaus said. Voting shares ( JBSS3.SA ) of Sao Paulo-based JBS fell as much as 2.3 percent to 6.82 reais, the lowest level since. Wednesday's decline in early trading was the steepest since December 28. Shares of Sara Lee fell 53 cents to $19.11 on Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange. The Downers Grove, Illinois-based company has indicated it would seriously consider a bid of roughly $20 per share in order to continue talks with a suitor, a separate source familiar with the situation said. The source was not authorized to speak to the media. The future of Sara Lee, with brands that also include Jimmy Dean sausages, has been in question for months. The company has been examining various options, such as selling itself or splitting itself up into meat and beverage units. (Editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
