 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said on Monday the Bush administration was trying to minimize the impact of a housing downturn on the economy rather than rush new stimulus measures. 

 "Our most immediate goal is to minimize the impact on the real economy," Paulson said in excerpts from a speech that he is to deliver in New York later. "Working through the current situation and getting the policy right is more important than getting the policy announced quickly." The Treasury Department released the speech excerpts ahead of his address to an event sponsored by the New York Society of Security Analysis.
