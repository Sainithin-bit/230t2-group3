 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - The U.S. economy is in troubled waters and the Federal Reserve needs to be ready to step in with a helping hand, a top official at the central bank said on Monday. 

 "The negatives in our economy may be gaining momentum," Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Dennis Lockhart told the Rotary Club of Atlanta in a speech. "I think these circumstances call for policy-makers to be prepared to respond pragmatically to whatever developments arise," he said. Speaking later to reporters, he said he "wouldn't foreclose" the possibility of further rate cuts, following three consecutive rate cuts by the U.S. central bank since last September. Asked how he saw the risks between slower growth and elevated inflation, the Atlanta Fed chief said: "I'm concerned about inflation ... but I'm equally or more concerned about... mounting slowness" in the economy. But he refrained from endorsing the increasingly popular view that the U.S. economy was headed for recession. "I'm predicting a slowing but growing economy," he told reporters. The Fed holds its next rate-setting meeting on January 29-30, where markets widely anticipate another rate cut. Lockhart is not a voting member this year on the Federal Open Market Committee. Outlining his economic outlook for the year, Lockhart said he expected a weak first half of 2008 but one of modest growth, with improvement beginning the second half and continuing into 2009. However, that outcome assumed that the housing situation would not deteriorate more than expected, and financial markets stabilize, he said. At the same time, the Atlanta Fed president said he was "troubled" by the elevated level of inflation. While he was basing his forecast on the view that inflation will moderate this year, recent rises in oil prices could mean his outlook was "too optimistic," he said. Lockhart later said his projections were based on oil prices in a $80-$90 range. Crude oil prices briefly hit $100 a barrel last week. The key issue would be how much the ongoing financial turbulence, which stemmed from losses in U.S. mortgage assets, would affect the broader economy. Lockhart, who comes from a banking background, said his Wall Street contacts held "serious concern about further -- and spreading -- market deterioration and potential spillover into the broader economy." "Trading conditions are still far from settled and orderly," he said, and to restore market confidence, leading financial firms should disclose losses, restore capital and liquidity ratios and improve risk assessment. Lockhart said the Fed's rate cuts since last September were aimed to forestall potential fallout from financial turmoil on the economy, but were not sufficient to fix strained market conditions. The Fed has cut the benchmark federal funds rate by a full percentage point since last September to 4.25 percent. Lockhart said that global coordinated efforts by major central banks at the year-end had been helpful in easing liquidity tensions and said he was "encouraged" by early results of auctions held under the new Term Auction Facility. Last month, the Fed, the European Central Bank and the British, Canadian and Swiss central banks jointly announced they would take measures to address tight conditions in the money market. The U.S. central bank set up the Term Auction Facility to provide funds to a wider range of banks and also extended dollar funds to the ECB and Swiss National Bank through currency swap agreements.
