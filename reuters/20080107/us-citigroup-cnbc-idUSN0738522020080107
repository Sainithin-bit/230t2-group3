 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Citigroup ( C.N ) is considering cutting 5 percent to 10 percent of its work force, which totals 327,000, CNBC television reported on Monday, without citing sources. 

 CNBC said a Citigroup announcement was likely to come later this month when the largest U.S. bank reports quarterly earnings. It also said the bank could sell off a smaller unit. (Reporting by  Christian Plumb ; editing by John Wallace)
