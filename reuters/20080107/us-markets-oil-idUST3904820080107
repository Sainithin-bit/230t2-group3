 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oil tumbled nearly 3 percent on Monday as warm U.S. weather and threats of a recession in the top energy consumer dragged prices further from the $100 record struck last week. 

 The drop came despite rising tensions between Tehran and Washington after five Iranian boats made aggressive maneuvers against three U.S. Navy ships in the Strait of Hormuz, a major oil shipping route.  U.S. oil CLc1 settled down $2.82 to $95.09 a barrel, extending losses from the previous session's $1.27 decline. London Brent crude LCOc1 settled $2.40 lower at $94.39. "Crude is down, with heating oil leading the market lower, due to warmer temperatures," said Tom Knight, trader for Truman Arnold. Forecasts for warm temperatures in the U.S. Northeast, the nation's biggest heating oil market, should depress demand for the fuel to 40 percent below normal levels, the National Weather Service forecast. U.S crude hit a session high of $98.40 a barrel following news of the tensions between the United States and Iran -- already at odds over a range of issues from Iran's nuclear program to U.S. allegations of Iranian support for terrorism -- at the weekend. The Pentagon said the incident was serious and described the Iranian actions as "careless, reckless and potentially hostile" and said Tehran should provide an explanation. The Iranian foreign ministry described the incident as ordinary. OFF PEAKS Oil has pulled back from the record peak of $100.09 a barrel, hit last Thursday on concerns over tight U.S. crude stockpiles. The retreat began after a U.S. report last week showed the nation's unemployment rate rose to 5 percent in December, its highest in more than two years. A weak economy has darkened the outlook for energy demand. "Concerns about the U.S. economy are clearly putting some pressure on oil prices. Some market players are also using this opportunity to take profits," said Gerard Burg, a resource analyst from the National Bank of Australia. Oil's move into triple figures also has increased expectations producer group OPEC would hike output when it meets on February 1 in Vienna. Saudi Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi said on Sunday that the rise in oil prices had been determined by market forces, but declined further comment on what action the cartel would take at the meeting. OPEC president Chakib Khelil said on Saturday he expected oil prices to keep rising during the first quarter of this year before stabilizing in the following quarter. Venezuela's energy minister on Monday said current prices were fair to producers and that there was no need to hike output.  Goldman Sachs, the most active investment bank in energy markets, forecast oil would average $95 a barrel in 2008. "We maintain that the combination of tighter short-term fundamentals and escalating costs will continue to provide strong support to oil prices in 2008, with the risk skewed to the upside from current levels," Goldman Sachs said. A Reuters poll of analysts forecast weekly U.S. inventory data to be released on Wednesday will show a 900,000 barrel draw in crude stocks, a 300,000 barrel gain in distillate supplies, and a 2.1 million barrel gasoline build.
