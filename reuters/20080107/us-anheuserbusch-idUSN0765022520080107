 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Anheuser-Busch Cos Inc ( BUD.N ) on Monday reported fourth-quarter sales that were better than some analysts expected, helped by the addition of foreign brands to its portfolio, sending its shares up 4 percent. 

 The brewer of Budweiser and Bud Light said beer shipments to wholesalers rose 3.4 percent, helped by an extra selling day in the latest quarter. Sales from wholesalers to retailers, adjusted for the extra day, rose 1.3 percent. Excluding acquired and imported brands, such as Tsingtao and Stella Artois, sales to retailers of Anheuser domestic brands fell 0.5 percent. UBS analyst Kaumil Gajrawala said the results were below his expectations but likely slightly ahead of the Wall Street consensus. Gajrawala reduced his fourth-quarter earnings estimate for Anheuser by a penny, to 30 cents a share, but gave an optimistic forecast for the company, which has seen sales of its domestic beers decline for some time as U.S. consumers choose foreign beers or "craft" beers brewed in smaller batches. "We believe the worst is behind them and (Anheuser) is positioned for core brand growth in 2008," Gajrawala wrote in a research note. He cited management's focus on growing its core brands, new marketing campaigns with increased spending in the key beer-drinking summer months, and easy comparisons. Morgan Stanley analyst William Pecoriello said volume growth in the fourth quarter was slower than in the third quarter but said this was expected. "More important will be volume trends over the coming months, where we will be watching for the impact of a slower economy, the impact of marketing changes on core brands ... and the impact of new product roll-outs," Pecoriello said. For the full year 2007, Anheuser said it sold 104.4 million barrels of beer to U.S. wholesalers, up 2 percent from 2006. Sales from wholesalers to retailers rose 1.3 percent for the year, the St. Louis-based brewer said. Anheuser shares rose $2.34 to $54.04 on the New York Stock Exchange, up 11 percent from a year ago.
