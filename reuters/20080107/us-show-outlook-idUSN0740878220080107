 LAS VEGAS  (Reuters) - Growth in U.S. consumer electronics sales is likely to slow in 2008 but still come in at 6.1 percent, fueled by strong demand for products like televisions and personal audio devices, an industry trade group said on Monday. 

 The Consumer Electronics Association forecast industry sales this year at $171 billion, up from an estimated $161 billion in 2007, which was an 8.2 percent rise from 2006. The outlook comes amid concerns about the troubled U.S. economy, which sent shares of technology bellwethers such as Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ) down on Monday. "Even with the very uncertain economy, consumers continue to demand our products," said Gary Shapiro, chief executive of the Consumer Electronics Association. "Today the average American home contains 25 consumer electronics products," Shapiro said at the annual Consumer Electronics Show, the industry's premier trade show. Electronics makers considering the strain on the U.S. economy are hoping consumers will cut other expenses first, but many see some worrying signs ahead. "Our industry's growth has been strong," Shapiro said, "and the momentum will continue in 2008." The Consumer Electronics Association's estimates cover factory-to-dealer shipments, or wholesale figures. They include sales of everything from iPods and audio cables to mobile phones and personal computers.
