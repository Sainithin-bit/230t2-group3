 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said on Monday the Bush administration is looking at how to strengthen the economy, but no decision has been made on using fiscal policy to stimulate growth. 

 "The administration is focused on what steps might be taken to further strengthen the economy," Paulson said in response to a question following a speech in New York. President George W. Bush "hasn't made a decision on whether he'll propose an action," Paulson said, referring to an action on fiscal policy. Paulson spoke to the New York Society of Financial Analysts.
