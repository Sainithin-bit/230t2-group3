 SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - Oil's roaring start to 2008 is not necessarily an indication of price movements for the year to come if the evidence of the past two years is any gauge. 

 A big difference in 2008 compared with the last two Januaries is that oil has reverted to its classical market structure, in which prompt contracts are more expensive than those for later delivery. This could encourage investment funds to stay in oil. Prices surged nearly 4 percent to touch a record $100 a barrel on Wednesday, the first trading day of 2008, driven not only by tightening U.S. oil supplies and geopolitical jitters but by the allocation of more fund capital into commodities. "With the new calendar year it's time to refresh the books and reallocate," said Steve Rowles, an analyst at CFC Seymour in Hong Kong. "And with risk aversion increasing, commodities seem to be seen as a safe haven right now." Pension funds and other long-term investors have pumped an estimated more than $100 billion into commodities over the past five years, often using long-only passive indices like the S&P GSCI .SPGSCITR that require investors to buy and hold positions. Their quarterly approach to shifting money between financial assets barely makes waves in huge trillion-dollar markets like U.S. equities or fixed-income, but can quickly roil oil, where the value of total open interest in New York Mercantile Exchange crude oil contracts comes to below $140 billion. Even at $100, investors' appetites appear little diminished. "We still have our maximum quota on oil and we don't see any reason to lighten up our position at all, since all the risks are still to the upside," said Justin Wilks, who helps manage Global Commodities, an Australian index-based fund of around $250 million, one of the few pure resource funds in Asia. This year's events struck a familiar seasonal chord with traders who recalled the run-up from below $60 to nearly $70 a barrel in the first few weeks of 2006, when a dearth of news put a spotlight on the impact of fund allocations. And few will forget the disappointment that greeted 2007, when prices dived more than $10 to below $50 as speculators who had hoped for a repeat of the fund frenzy bailed out. In both cases the momentum move proved short-lived -- by mid-February prices had reverted to pre-new year levels. FALSE SIGNALS Both gave false signals for the year ahead -- after 2006's rip-roaring start, oil prices managed a gain of only 1 cent; in 2007 prices closed the year almost $35 higher. The erosion of gains in 2006 coincided with the persistence of an atypical oil market structure, known as contango, when prompt prices are discounted to future oil prices. This wipes out returns that funds can make from rolling positions in prompt contracts into those for later delivery. But last July, the oil market reverted to its more characteristic backwardated structure, in which prompt prices are the most expensive. Even with the return of backwardation, gains could be short-lived. Some analysts said a quick push above $100 could quickly give way to a profit-taking retracement as speculators anticipate the inflow of fresh capital tapering off. "A repeat of last year's performance where saw a bit of a downdraft during January is a possible scenario," says Jim Ritterbusch, of Ritterbusch and Associates. "Another one or two weeks down the road we could see significant selling around the $100 level." Some pension funds and other non-speculative investors have invested in commodities for the first time with allocations of about 3 to 5 percent, hoping to capture a sustained bull run but also gain diversity from mainstay stock and bond holdings. The biggest U.S. pension fund, Calpers, took the plunge last March, investing just $450 million of its $230 billion assets. And despite a growing preference for more nuanced products that will allow passive players to benefit from more active strategies or longer-dated positions, demand is expected to remain strong as more funds seek out the sector. Standard & Poor's, which bought the world's leading commodity index from Goldman Sachs last year, said it expected total index investments to rise to $150 billion this year from $110 in 2007. "There's been a desire to diversify and much of it has included the metals over the last few years," said Darren Heathcote, a gold analyst at Investec Australia. "It's difficult to ignore (commodities) when they've been doing so well, fund managers are forced to include them."
