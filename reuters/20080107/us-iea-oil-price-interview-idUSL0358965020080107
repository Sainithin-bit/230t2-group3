 PARIS  (Reuters) - The International Energy Agency will not coordinate a release of emergency crude stocks from its member states to calm record oil prices, its deputy head said on Thursday. 

 "We are not going to carry out (emergency) oil stock release, we don't respond to prices, and we don't see any disruption in the physical oil markets," the IEA's deputy head, William Ramsay, told Reuters in an interview. Oil hit its lifetime record of $100 per barrel on Wednesday, fuelled by expectations of thinning U.S. stockpiles, the falling dollar and geopolitical risks. The price eased a little to some 50 cents below that on Thursday. A sicker U.S. economy affecting consumption would vie with international tensions and winter demand to set the course of crude prices, Ramsay said. "Some could argue that the economic news in the States would be fairly bearish for the markets, you could see prices coming off," he said. "But it's the dead of winter so weather can be a determining factor, and they are geopolitics out there at play." "So it could go either way." But there was no fundamental reason for $100 oil, Ramsay added. "We don't see any reason for prices to be that high," he said. "It doesn't cost that kind of money to find oil, to process it and to ship it. There was one transaction with a couple of guys having fun with the market." When asked whether OPEC should raise output at its next meeting on February 1, he said: "There are all kinds of signals out there that the market would be happy with more oil." The IEA was anxious that consumers were not reducing their consumption in response to the high prices. "Either markets are protected by dollar deflation, or by subsidies," Ramsay said. The weakness of the dollar has spurred speculative buying that has boosted the price of oil and other commodities as it makes dollar-dominated assets cheaper. "And if consumers don't respond themselves to prices then you have to get governments to move to other measures and governments have a responsibility to do that," Ramsay said. The IEA, energy adviser to 28 industrialized countries, said last month world oil demand will grow more quickly than expected in 2008, fuelled by stronger consumption in the Middle East. Ramsay also urged producing nations, including non-OPEC countries, to release more oil onto the market. "That means investment climate, that also means longer-term considerations," he said.
