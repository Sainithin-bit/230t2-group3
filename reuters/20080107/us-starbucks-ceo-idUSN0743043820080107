 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp ( SBUX.O ) on Monday said Chief Executive Jim Donald is leaving the company, effective immediately. Howard Schultz, the coffee shop chain's founder and chairman, will take on the CEO role. 

 The following are comments on the changes at the top at Starbucks:   COMMENTS JOHN OWENS, MORNINGSTAR ANALYST On Schultz as CEO -- "First of all, the stock price is down 50 percent from its 52-week high. It is not surprising to see the shakeup. Howard Schultz was instrumental in building this business from the ground up. So he is imminently qualified to be the CEO of the company." On competition -- "Starbucks is facing increasing competition from the fast-food sector, notable McDonald's (Corp ( MCD.N )) and Dunkin' (Donuts). Those companies are competing more on price. Starbucks has to justify the premium that they charge. I think Schultz realizes that. "I think Schultz is very qualified to lead this company." On international expansion -- "The brand has traveled pretty well internationally and there is a lot of opportunity outside the United States, particularly in markets like China. So, I do believe that is a good move." ANDREW WILKINSON, SENIOR MARKET ANALYST AT INTERACTIVE  BROKERS GROUP IN GREENWICH, CONN. "The return of Howard Schultz is probably a welcome move to Starbucks shareholders. But I think the problems facing the company probably run deeper. The challenge from McDonald's means that the end of the day, Starbucks is dealing with a simple commodity, namely coffee and McDonald's is accustomed to appealing to an audience based on price, quality and brand. "Starbucks has already announced their plans on store growth and ultimately that can't be good for revenues." FRED DICKSON, MARKET STRATEGIST, DIRECTOR OF RETAIL  RESEARCH, D.A. DAVIDSON & CO. LAKE OSWEGO, OREGON (Davidson makes a market in Starbucks shares) "The move was probably contemplated and all in reaction to McDonald's starting to test premium coffees in selected stores -- (McDonald's) made that announcement 2-3 months ago. "Starbucks conceded in the announcement that it is looking to close underperforming locations -- they haven't been that visual in terms of its company announcements and they are conceding the need to tighten up execution. "It's a return to a new leader and there may be some internal emotional euphoria. Short term, it looks like they have their work cut out for them to protect market from McDonald's."  DAN GEIMAN, MCADAMS WRIGHT RAGEN ANALYST, HAS "BUY" RATING ON  THE SHARES "It is pretty clear that Starbucks' execution could have been a little bit better over that period. Given that, I think it was time for change. It's something that investors are going to be pretty receptive to." On Schultz -- "He is clearly a vision behind this business. He ran it successfully in the past (albeit a ways in the past). He's been involved in the business since he relinquished his CEO role, but from a much more top level, more strategic standpoint. He hasn't been so involved in operations for a long time. That is certainly going to change at this point. "I still think there is a lot of potential overseas. I think there is quite a bit of opportunity in the US. I think it is a positive that they are focusing a little bit more on their current stores that they are operating. There are some things they can do to drive some improvements, some better productivity in those stores. LARRY MILLER, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS I'm not surprised that Jim's leaving. I kind of got the feeling that that might happen (we just met with them in December). He's normally a very energetic guy. He looked pretty deflated. "I think investors will be more excited about Starbucks slowing store growth than the change in management but I'm sure people are happy to see Howard back as well."
