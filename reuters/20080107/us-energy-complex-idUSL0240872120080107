 (Reuters) - An oil rally which took prices to a record $100 a barrel on Wednesday has knock-on effects for the price of all sources of energy. 

 The following is a summary of what expensive oil means for other kinds of fuel. GAS Long-term gas contracts can be priced off oil products, so strength in oil pushes up gas prices. Britain, like the United States, is a liberalized gas market, but some gas contracts are still priced off oil products and in Europe most are. The flow of gas from Britain to continental Europe exaggerates the impact. On the British gas market, gas for delivery in the first quarter of 2010 posted the strongest gains, rising 8.40 pence to 60.20 pence per therm by midday on Thursday, according to one broker. ELECTRICITY Gas is often used in generating power, so higher gas prices in turn push up power contracts, especially for later delivery. COAL Coal can replace oil-fired power generation and therefore expensive oil can be supportive of coal prices, which hit records above the $100 a tonne threshold late last year and have remained strong. OIL PRODUCTS Oil products, such as gasoline and diesel, have followed crude prices higher, but the gains have been less spectacular than on crude, meaning the profits made by refiners have been eroded. NUCLEAR POWER The more expensive oil becomes, the more competitive nuclear power is. According to the Paris-based Nuclear Energy Agency, nuclear energy is competitive when oil prices are anything above $40-to $45 a barrel. The cost of uranium has also been rising, but it represents only around 5 percent of the total cost of generating nuclear power, whereas gas represents around three quarters of the cost of gas-generated power. RENEWABLES The price of biofuels, derived from plants as an alternative to gasoline and diesel, rises with the price of oil, because the two share similar inputs and because oil itself is used in the manufacture of biofuels. However a long-term, high oil price will raise sentiment for biofuels and for renewable sources of electricity such as wind and solar, and boost investment in the clean energy sector. CARBON PRICE The European carbon price is the amount industrial installations pay for permits to emit the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO2), called EU allowances (EUAs), under the European Union's emissions trading scheme. Power generators pass on the cost of EUAs to electricity consumers, and so the carbon price is an add-on to the European electricity price. Higher oil and gas prices drive generators to burn coal instead, and because coal produces the most carbon emissions per unit of energy produced, that should drive up the demand for and price of EUAs, and of electricity.
