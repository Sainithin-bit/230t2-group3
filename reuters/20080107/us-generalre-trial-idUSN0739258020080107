 HARTFORD, Connecticut  (Reuters) - Former executives at a reinsurance unit of billionaire Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc engaged in a fraud that misled investors in American International Group Inc ( AIG.N ), a U.S. prosecutor told jurors on Monday. 

 "The deal appeared to be legitimate, but evidence in reality showed the deal was nothing but a sham transaction to deceive analysts and shareholders -- and these five defendants knew it," Assistant U.S. Attorney Raymond Patricco told jurors in his opening statement at their criminal trial. Buffett, chairman of Berkshire, could be called to testify in the trial of the five defendants, four of whom worked at Berkshire's ( BRKa.N )( BRKb.N ) General Re Corp unit. The fifth worked at AIG. According to Berkshire, Buffett was not briefed on the structure of the AIG transaction, and was unaware it might have had any improper purpose. The defendants, including former Gen Re Chief Executive Ronald Ferguson, are on trial at the U.S. District Court in Connecticut. They are charged with conspiracy, fraud and making false statements in connection with a 2000 reinsurance transaction that prosecutors say allowed AIG to improperly boost reserves by $500 million in 2000 and 2001. Prosecutors say this misled investors about the amount of losses that the insurer could withstand, and artificially inflated AIG stock. AIG has acknowledged accounting improprieties, and in May 2005 restated $3.9 billion in earnings from 2000 through 2004. It agreed in 2006 to a related $1.64 billion regulatory settlement. The restatement came two months after the ouster of AIG's long-time chief, Maurice "Hank" Greenberg, who is an unindicted, alleged co-conspirator in the government's case. Greenberg has denied wrongdoing. PHONE CALL Prosecutor Patricco said the defendants crafted the deal after Greenberg called Ferguson, who was then running Stamford, Connecticut-based Gen Re, and said he needed help bolstering AIG's loss reserves by $500 million. "When Greenberg came calling, Ferguson had a clear choice: Take $500 million, no strings attached, or disappoint Gen Re's biggest client," he said. In a statement, a Greenberg spokesman said that "there is no evidence that Mr. Greenberg initiated, participated in, or knew of a conspiracy or fraudulent scheme." Others on trial include three other former Gen Re executives: former Chief Financial Officer Elizabeth Monrad, former senior Vice President Christopher Garand and former Assistant General Counsel Robert Graham. The fifth defendant is former AIG head of reinsurance Christian Milton. A lawyer for Ferguson, Michael Horowitz, told jurors there was no motive for his client to participate in any fraud. "Ron is not guilty of the charges in this case," he said. "The government can't prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt." Lawyers for the other defendants were to give their opening statements later Monday. If convicted, Ferguson, Monrad, Milton and Graham each face more than 200 years in prison and a $46 million fine, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office. Garand faces up to 150 years in prison and a $29.5 million fine. (Writing by  Martha Graybow  and Jonathan Stempel, editing by Leslie Gevirtz,  Gary Hill )
