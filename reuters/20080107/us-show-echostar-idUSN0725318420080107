 LAS VEGAS  (Reuters) - Satellite television provider EchoStar Communications Corp ( DISH.O ) has yet to decide whether it will bid in an upcoming auction of wireless airwaves that could be used for mobile Internet services, Chief Executive Charlie Ergen said on Monday. 

 "We've applied to the 700 megahertz auction so we're in a position to participate," Ergen said in response to a question at a press conference at the Consumer Electronics Show here. "We'll look and see what people are doing in the auction, and if it makes sense for us to participate or not," he said. "We haven't decided what we're going to do." Dish trails only DirecTV Group Inc ( DTV.O ) in the U.S. satellite television services market, but also faces competition from cable providers and telephone service providers such as AT&T Inc ( T.N ) and Verizon Communications Inc ( VZ.N ), which sell cell phone, traditional phone and wired broadband Internet services as well as video in packages. AT&T Inc ( T.N ) has a marketing partnership with EchoStar in some markets but competes with it in others. EchoStar had about 13.7 million subscribers at its last count in early November.
