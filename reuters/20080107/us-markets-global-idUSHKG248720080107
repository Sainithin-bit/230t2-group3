 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Stock prices gyrated on Monday as investors concerned about a possible U.S. recession saw a drop in oil and gold prices easing some of those fears. 

 Following a more than 4.0 percent fall in U.S. stocks last week, markets globally were back up to full staff after the New Year holidays, with many investors reviewing the damage before making new bets for 2008. Adding to some of the volatility was a brief incident involving U.S. and Iranian naval ships over the weekend in the Strait of Hormuz, a major oil shipping route in the Gulf. After an initial rise, crude oil prices fell $2.56 a barrel to $95.35 on unseasonably warm U.S. weather and looming recession concerns. Oil hit a lifetime high last week above $100 a barrel. Stock prices in Europe ended unchanged in a choppy session, while the U.S. dollar gained value as traders trimmed bets against the greenback on speculation that U.S. inflation may prevent aggressive cuts in interest rates. "Overall, we still have concerns about inflation and inflation expectations," said Ron Simpson, director of currency research at Action Economics in Tampa, Florida. U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said on Monday the Bush Administration was considering how to give the economy a boost as it weathers a housing market decline. Weak December U.S. jobs data on Friday raised concerns the U.S. economy may be headed for recession. "With data on Friday showing unemployment ticking up, that's probably going to keep investors a little spooked," said Owen Fitzpatrick, head of U.S. Equity Group at Deutsche Bank Private Wealth Management in New York. In stocks, benchmark indexes were up at midsession Monday. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was up 55.03 points, or 0.43 percent, at 12,855.21. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was up 9.56 points, or 0.68 percent, at 1,421.19. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 13.75 points, or 0.55 percent, at 2,518.40. In European trading, the FTSEurofirst 300 index, ended up just 0.01 percent at 1457.79. London's FTSE 100 index fell 0.1 percent, recovering from losses of 1.2 percent. Gold last week rose to record highs just below $870 an ounce but fell back on Monday to $859.30, down $1.50 or 0.17 percent. In emerging markets, equities fell by more than 1.0 percent, but sovereign dollar-denominated emerging market debt yield spreads tightened. GOVERNMENT DEBT U.S. Treasuries were slightly mixed after Friday's big fall in yields in the wake of the dismal U.S. jobs data. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was up 2/32, with the yield at 3.8669 percent. "Everyone is watching equities with one eye," said Richard Schlanger, portfolio manager at Pioneer Investments USA in Boston. "The market is pricing in for a significant economic slowdown." Yields on the two-year Schatz, often viewed as the most sensitive to investor thinking on the likely course of monetary policy in Europe, were at 3.788 percent, compared with 3.749 percent late on Friday, in their first rise for a week. Fixed income investors expect the European Central Bank to leave euro zone interest rates at 4.0 percent at its policy meeting on Thursday. ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet told officials from the Group of 10 leading economies in the Swiss city of Basel global economic growth was expected to remain robust although there were clear downside risks from the market turmoil of last year, as well as high commodity prices. DOLLAR BOUNCE In currencies, the dollar was up against a basket of major trading-partner currencies, with the New York Board of Trade's U.S. Dollar Index up 0.44 percent at 76.204 from a previous session close of 75.868. The euro was down 0.43 percent at $1.468 from a previous session close of $1.4743. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar was up 0.46 percent at 109.02 from a previous session close of 108.52.
