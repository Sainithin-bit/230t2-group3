 LAS VEGAS  (Reuters) - Hitachi Ltd ( 6501.T ) expects to reach its unit-sales targets for plasma and liquid crystal display televisions in the year ending in March, Makoto Ebata, president of Hitachi's consumer business group, told Reuters on Monday. 

 The Japanese electronics conglomerate has targeted plasma TV sales of 1.2 million units and 800,000 LCD TVs in the current fiscal year. Ebata spoke after a briefing at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, where Hitachi unveiled plans to sell ultra-thin 1.5-inch plasma and LCD TVs in the United States.
