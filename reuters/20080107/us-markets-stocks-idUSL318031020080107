 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Dow industrials and the S&P 500 rose on Monday, led by health-care and consumer staple shares, as investors snapped up stock in companies seen able to withstand any economic slowdown following dismal employment data last Friday. 

 Drug maker Merck & Co ( MRK.N ) and cigarette maker Altria Group Inc ( MO.N ) were among defensive plays by investors that helped the S&P and the Dow eke out gains at the end of a choppy session and gave the S&P its first positive finish of 2008. But the Nasdaq finished lower, as technology shares with global exposure fell on concerns a U.S. slowdown could damage the global economy. Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ) fell 1.3 percent, while Hewlett-Packard Co ( HPQ.N ) slid 3.2 percent. "The market is trying to find its footing after a poor start to the year," said Kurt Brunner, portfolio manager with the Swarthmore Group in Philadelphia. "The staples names are hanging on in there, but you've had a lot of talk about the global slowdown and how that is going to impact the industrial names and technology. Hewlett's really taking it on the chin today." Retailers will be in the spotlight on Tuesday. After Monday's closing bell shares of Circuit City CC.N fell 5 percent to $4 when the electronics retailer reported an 8.9 percent drop in December sales. Shares of Starbucks Corp ( SBUX.O ), meanwhile, rose 4.5 percent to $19.20 in extended trade after the coffee house chain said Chairman Howard Schultz will return in the additional role of chief executive and the company will focus on international growth. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  ended up 27.31 points, or 0.21 percent, at 12,827.49. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was up 4.55 points, or 0.32 percent, at 1,416.18. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  fell 5.19 points, or 0.21 percent, to close at 2,499.46. This has been the worst start to a year for the Nasdaq since 2000, when it started the first four days of the year down 8.4 percent. So far this year it is down 5.76 percent. All three major indexes kicked off the year sharply lower last week, albeit in thin volume. By Monday, most trading desks were fully staffed. On Friday, a dismal jobs report added to recession concerns, which persisted as a major theme in Monday's trading. U.S. President George W. Bush said on Monday the U.S. economy is well positioned to withstand shocks from the housing slump, financial market turmoil and high oil prices, though he said continued economic expansion is not a certainty. Merck shares gained 1.9 percent to $57.92 on the New York Stock Exchange, while shares of Altria, parent of cigarette maker Philip Morris USA, gained 3.1 percent to $77.23. Biotechnology company Celgene Corp ( CELG.O ) rose 1.7 percent to $50.49 after targeting a 45 percent rise in adjusted earnings for 2008. Eli Lilly ( LLY.N ) posted its biggest one-day advance in more than 2-1/2 years on news Morgan Stanley upped its recommendation on the drugmaker's stock. Its stock was up 5.3 percent to $54.55. AT&T ( T.N ) rose 1.3 percent to $41.43, and was the top boost to the S&P 500, after Deutsche Bank named it as its top large-cap telecom services pick for 2008, with a price target of $50. Utilities also lent the market support, led by FPL Group Inc FPL.N, which gained 4.7 percent to $72.03. A sharp pullback in crude oil prices CLc1 hurt shares of energy companies. Exxon Mobil ( XOM.N ) fell 0.9 percent to $91.22. U.S. crude tumbled 2.7 percent a barrel to $95.14 on the New York Mercantile Exchange as unseasonably warm weather and worries of a looming recession in the United States, the world's top oil consumer, outweighed tensions between Iran and the United States. The latest geopolitical concerns also added to investors' unease on Monday. The Pentagon said five Iranian boats made aggressive maneuvers and showed hostile intent against three U.S. Navy ships at the weekend in the Strait of Hormuz. Oil flows through the Strait account for roughly 40 percent of globally traded oil, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Trading was moderate on the NYSE, with about 1.71 billion shares changing hands, just below last year's estimated daily average of 1.84 billion, while on Nasdaq, about 2.59 billion shares traded, ahead of last year's daily average of 2.02 billion. Rising stocks outnumbered falling ones by a ratio of about 9 to 7 on the NYSE, while on the Nasdaq decliners beat advancers by a ratio of about 8 to 7. (Editing by Leslie Adler)
