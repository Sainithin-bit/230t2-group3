 LONDON  (Reuters) - Ailing British bank Northern Rock NRK.L is not a "lame duck" and its value is far higher than its current share price, its biggest investor said on Monday as it sought backing to prevent a hasty rescue deal. 

 Hedge fund SRM Global said Northern Rock was "a strong and viable business" and its book value "is materially in excess of its current share price". SRM and RAB Capital, the next biggest shareholder, have requested a shareholder meeting for investors to vote on whether assets can be sold or significant new shares issued. The meeting and vote will be held on January 15. Northern Rock has said the proposals could hinder a swift rescue, but SRM said it would not materially extend the timetable for a deal. "It will prevent hasty action which would needlessly destroy value in the company," Monaco-based SRM said. RAB, which together with SRM owns over 17 percent of Northern Rock's shares, said in a letter released on Sunday it was concerned that political considerations could overshadow the interests of Northern Rock's stakeholders. Northern Rock shares were up 2.1 percent at 85.75 pence at mid-morning, valuing the bank at 360 million pounds ($710 million). U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs is close to completing a 15 billion pound financing package to be used by potential suitors, according to a weekend newspaper report, which raised optimism that a deal for the bank can be reached, dealers said. Northern Rock, the Treasury and advisers are trying to reach a deal by the end of this month. Britain's highest profile casualty of the credit crunch is in talks with two rival consortiums led by investment groups Virgin and Olivant, but a credit market crisis has raised concern that bidders will struggle to finance a deal.
