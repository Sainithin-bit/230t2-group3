 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Reto Francioni, the Swiss head of the world's largest exchange operator, doesn't like the limelight, and is shying away from it even after years of trying to tie the knot with a major peer finally seems to have borne fruit. 

 Even those who work for Francioni at Deutsche Boerse say they barely know him. At 55, he has been head of the exchange and derivatives operator since 2005, and is set to become chairman of a newly created empire combining Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext, which are in advanced merger talks. Deutsche Boerse and Francioni, whose contract was due to expire in 2013, appear to be in the driver's seat. "This would be a dazzling departure for Francioni (as CEO) since large strategic moves (regarding the company) shouldn't have been expected to come from him," Christian Muschick, an analyst at Silvia Quandt in Frankfurt said. Francioni's blandness was seen as an asset when he was hired for the CEO job given that his predecessor, the temperamental Werner Seifert never managed to pull off a major deal. Deutsche Boerse has been seen as the bully in the world of exchanges, bearing down on smaller peers but had failed so far to clinch a major deal. Francioni's track record is mixed, given he failed to clinch a merger deal with Euronext, which eventually merged with NYSE, and that Deutsche Boerse's only other acquisition U.S. options exchange ISE has proven a drag on earnings. Deutsche Boerse also held merger talks with NYSE Euronext in 2008 that would have helped it improve its cost structure, address pressure from activist hedge funds and grab market share in European exchange-traded derivatives. The talks ended with no result. "I'm astounded this merger that was dismissed two years ago is now back," Adrian Cronje, chief investment officer at Balentine, an Atlanta-based wealth management firm with $800 million in client assets, said. Francioni, a Francophile with a penchant for Burgundy wines, is often content to let others do the talking, rarely appearing before the press and withdrawing to back rooms when others are grandstanding in public appearances. During downtime, he likes to retreat in the Swiss mountains, carrying only an old-fashioned mobile phone rather than the flashy smartphone devices many of his peers flaunt, rare in an industry driven by the breakneck speed of technological innovation.
