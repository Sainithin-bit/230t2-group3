 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - The derivatives unit of Deutsche Boerse-NYSE Euronext will be headquartered in Frankfurt, while New York will get stock trading, two sources close to deal said on Thursday. 

 "That way Frankfurt will get the main value driver of the merged company," one of the sources said. As part of the merger plans, a new company or "NewCo" will be set up, which will merge with NYSE-Euronext in a first step. "This new entity will make a share-for-share offer for Deutsche Boerse," the source said. The headquarters of the new company's combined information technology (IT) operations will be in Paris, one source said, while another source said this was still under discussion. The deal was not pushed by any shareholders but was an initiative of the boards of both companies based on existing drafts, one of the sources said. "It was just taken from a drawer. But it will be a long and drawn-out process, given the complexity of two legal systems and the need for several steps of regulatory approval."
