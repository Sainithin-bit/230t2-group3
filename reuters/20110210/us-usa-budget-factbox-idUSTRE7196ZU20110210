 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President Barack Obama will release a budget for fiscal year 2012 on Monday that seeks to balance his pledge to reduce the deficit while making investments to boost the economy. 

 The budget, an outline of the president's policy goals that the U.S. Congress can more or less use or discard, will be watched closely for specifics on how Obama, a Democrat, appeals to Republicans with spending cuts while appealing to his own base with support for popular programs. Below is a list of items to look for: SPENDING FREEZE The president has said the budget will include a 5-year freeze on non-security discretionary spending as a downpayment toward curbing the U.S. budget deficit, which the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates will hit $1.48 trillion in fiscal 2011. This freeze is slated to lower the deficit by $400 million over ten years. DEFENSE The Defense Department accounts for 19 percent of U.S. federal spending and roughly half of discretionary spending -- making it an attractive target for policy makers looking for ways to slash the deficit. Defense Secretary Robert Gates announced plans last month to cut $78 billion from the Pentagon's core $550 billion-plus spending plan from 2012 through 2016. His plan calls for cutting up to 47,000 troops from the Army and Marines starting in 2015 after Afghan forces are scheduled to take the lead on security in that country. But the administration still plans to ask Congress for a core Pentagon budget of around $553 billion in fiscal 2012, up slightly from the previous year's request. Since 2001, the Pentagon's base, non-war budget has nearly doubled. For fiscal 2011, Obama requested $112.9 billion for defense procurement. The sum sought for 2012 could affect shares of top Pentagon suppliers such as Lockheed Martin Corp, Boeing Co and Northrop Grumman Corp. REGULATORS' FUNDING Last year Obama asked for big increases to the budgets for two key regulators that need to boost staff and technology to police the vast over-the-counter derivatives market, worth $600 trillion globally. But Congress put the brakes on budget increases for 2011, and the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission have felt the squeeze. The agencies say they'll need an increase if they are to put their share of newly-passed financial regulatory reforms into place. MEDICARE AND MEDICAID All eyes will be on whether Obama tackles entitlement spending by cutting the popular Medicare and Medicaid health insurance programs for the elderly, disabled and poor. Although many acknowledge that spiraling Medicare costs are driving up the deficit and undermine the program's financial stability, cutting a popular benefit for older Americans who are also a major voting bloc is politically risky. FARM SUBSIDIES For the third year in a row, Obama may try to cut subsidy payments to the big farmers who dominate U.S. agriculture. He could propose a cap of $60,000 per farmer from the $5 billion guaranteed annually to grain, cotton and soybean growers. The limit now is $80,000. Cuts also could be proposed for land stewardship. Lawmakers say any cuts should be deferred until farm policy is overhauled in 2012. STATES BAILOUT Obama could bail out states through the back door. There is little appetite among lawmakers or voters to repeat the extraordinary assistance in the $814 billion economic stimulus plan, which included the largest transfer of federal funds to states in U.S. history. But the federal government regularly sends states billions of dollars through a variety of avenues and Obama could simply pump more money through those channels. He could send more money for highways, for example, or expand the popular "Race to the Top" education grant program. CITIES AND COUNTIES Already, White House Office of Management and Budget Director Jacob Lew has said Obama will cut community development grants, a major source of revenue for municipalities and a program Obama heralded in last year's budget as part of his "urban vision." Cities and counties will closely dissect the budget for other programs Obama might slash. BUILD AMERICA BONDS Created in the stimulus plan, taxable Build America Bonds paid issuers federal rebates equal to 35 percent of interest costs, a subsidy so steep that the debt caught on like wildfire with governments and gave them sorely needed access to credit. The program ended in December and efforts to extend it failed. The budget is one place where BABs could find new life, given that Obama's administration considers Build America Bonds one of the stimulus plan's chief successes and in last year's budget Obama suggested making them permanent. NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE BANK Many states and major cities are eager to see Obama make good on his campaign promise to found a national infrastructure bank that would help finance big-ticket transport projects by combining federal, state and local government funds with private money. In last year's budget he suggested putting $4 billion into starting up a bank, but the concept recently lost its chief supporter in Congress, Chris Dodd who retired from the Senate, and a federal government survey last summer found there was little consensus among financial analysts and public officials on how the bank should be structured or its mission.
