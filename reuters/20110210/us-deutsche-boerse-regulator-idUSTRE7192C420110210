 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - A financial regulator at the German regional state of Hesse, home to Deutsche Boerse, said that it would seek preserve the interests of Frankfurt as a financial center when it reviews the group's plans to merge with NYSE Euronext. 

 The regulator, part of the state's financial ministry, bestows the license to operate a stock exchange in the state of Hesse and must approve any merger agreement. The watchdog's spokeswoman Ulrike Franz-Stoecker said it had not yet received formal notification of any deal. (Reporting by Harro ten Wolde and  Edward Taylor )
