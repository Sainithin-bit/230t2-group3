 TOKYO  (Reuters) - The Tokyo Stock Exchange is not discussing a merger with any other exchanges, the bourse's CEO said on Thursday, quashing any speculation the TSE will participate in the latest spate of global alliances among stock exchanges. 

 "At the moment we are not talking with anyone," Atsushi Saito told reporters. Saito's comment comes after Deutsche Boerse revealed on Wednesday it was in talks to buy NYSE Euronext in a deal that would create the world's largest trading powerhouse. That announcement came hours after the London Stock Exchange said it had agreed to buy Canadian market operator TMX. In Asia, the Singapore Exchange, in which the TSE owns a stake, is attempting a $7.9 billion takeover of Australian bourse operator ASX. Kyodo news agency quoted Saito as saying, however, that a future merger with the Osaka Securities Exchange, a smaller rival in western Japan, was "theoretically possible."
