 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - NYSE Euronext Chief Executive Duncan Niederauer's sometimes blunt management style will be put to the test as he negotiates the delicate task of combining two big international exchanges. 

 NYSE and Deutsche Boerse said on Wednesday that they were in talks to unite, though any deal would have to survive regulatory hurdles in a number of countries. Niederauer, 51, is being tapped to be CEO of the combined company, even though NYSE is the smaller of the two, a move that will make him a global player and show how deft he is as an operator. Deutsche Boerse's chief, Reto Francioni, will be the new company's chairman. Niederauer insisted not so long ago that he and his company would never be the junior partner in a tie-up with anyone. "I don't think we can be acquired," Niederauer said at the Reuters Exchanges and Trading Summit in New York in 2009, after rumors of a tie-up with Deutsche Boerse first arose. "We're either a merger partner or an acquirer." The smooth, publicly mild-mannered Niederauer has also proved he won't back down from a fight with rivals. Last year, his counterpart at Nasdaq OMX, Robert Greifeld, blamed NYSE for the May 6 flash crash during which the Dow Jones index fell 1,000 points within minutes. It took Niederauer less than a half hour to take to CNBC television's airways with his riposte. "We're simply slowing down the race car when we think it's dangerous," he told CNBC, referring to the exchange's decision to shift more trading to traditional human specialists amid the market chaos that day. Niederauer, who became CEO of NYSE Euronext in 2007, succeeding John Thain, has a reputation for speaking his mind, even if it means ruffling feathers. As head of NYSE's trading operations before he was named CEO, Niederauer angered floor traders in 2007, warning them that most of the open outcry trading at the Big Board's beaux-arts building in Lower Manhattan would be phased out, as the NYSE sought to stay competitive in the era of electronic trading. "These market makers on the floor have to go through what a lot of people in the industry have gone through," Niederauer said at the time, even as traders poured scorn on him. But as someone who had previously spent 22 years at Goldman Sachs most recently overseeing the investment bank's U.S. floor trading and electronic trading business, he also saw the business case in keeping some flesh-and-blood traders around too. So Niederauer pushed for blending electronic trading and traditional floor trading as a way to distinguish the Big Board from rival Nasdaq OMX Group. As head of a company that absorbed six European exchanges in a $14 billion deal in 2006, he has learned how to massage the egos of regulators and executives in the many countries in which his company operates, even as he asserted the New York Stock Exchange's supremacy within the company. When Thain left in December 2007 to take the top job at brokerage Merrill Lynch, now part of Bank of America, Niederauer was deferential to his predecessor, a fellow Goldman alum who after all had hired him. "Will our strategy be rethought after John's departure? Absolutely not," he told a banking conference. But unlike Thain, who oversaw NYSE's acquisition of Franco-Belgian rival Euronext, Niederauer has not yet had the chance to oversee a mega-merger, preferring smaller deals like buying a 25 percent stake in Qatar's Doha stock market for $250 million in a 2008 deal. Until now. "John was the right man then, and I hope I'm the right man now," he said that year. (Reporting by Phil Wahba; Editing by  Bernard Orr )
