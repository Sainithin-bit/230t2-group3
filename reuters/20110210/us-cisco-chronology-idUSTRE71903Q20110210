 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Network equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc's CEO John Chambers spooked investors for the third time in as many quarters, warning of dwindling public spending and weaker margins from tough competition. 

 Chambers is one of Silicon Valley's longest-serving executives and is considered a good reader of industry trends. He was one of the first executives to flag the impact of the financial meltdown on the technology sector in late 2007. Below are some of Chambers' comments in recent years: AUGUST 2007 "I have been in this business for 30 years ... It's the strongest global economy I have been a part of." NOVEMBER 2007 Chambers warned of "dramatic decreases" in orders from U.S. banks. FEBRUARY 2008 "It's the most cautious I've seen CEOs in the U.S. and Europe in many years." MAY 2009 "You can call it stability, you can call it leveling out ... for the first time many of them feel something solid beneath their feet as opposed to going into deeper and deeper water." AUGUST 2010 "We are seeing a large number of mixed signals in both the market and from our customers' expectations, and we think the words 'unusual uncertainty' are an accurate description of what is occurring." NOVEMBER 2010 Chambers cites "short-term challenges" as government spending shrinks. JANUARY 2011 "Unfortunately, we believe that our concerns in the public sector will continue to be challenging in the developed world for the next several quarters." "The challenges at state, local, and eventually federal level in our opinion will worsen over the next several quarters," he said of the U.S. market.
