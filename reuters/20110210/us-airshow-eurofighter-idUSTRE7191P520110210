 BANGALORE  (Reuters) - European consortium Eurofighter expects the global combat aircraft export market to reach 800 units in 20 years, and it expects to deliver 250 of those planes, a senior executive said on Thursday. 

 Eurofighter, a four-nation consortium of EADS ( EAD.PA ), representing Germany and Spain, Britain's BAE Systems ( BAES.L ) and Italy's Finmeccanica ( SIFI.MI ), is in the race for an $11 billion Indian contract for 126 fighter jets, one of the largest export orders in the history of defense. It is competing with Saab's ( SAABb.ST ) JAS-39 Gripen, Boeing's F/A-18 Super Hornet, Dassault's ( AVMD.PA ) Rafale, Lockheed's F-16 and Russia's MiG-35 to win the fighter contract. "India and other nations in Asia are important markets for combat aircraft," Enzo Casolini, chief executive of Eurofighter, said in a statement issued at India's biennial air show. "All nations are watching closely how India is running this tough competition and will evaluate the final result in every detail," he said.
