 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - New U.S. claims for unemployment benefits dropped more than expected last week to touch their lowest point in 2-1/2 years, a government report showed on Thursday, offering assurance that the labor market was strengthening despite January's poor jobs numbers. 

 KEY POINTS: * Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 36,000 to a seasonally adjusted 383,000, the lowest since early July 2008, the Labor Department said. * Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims slipping to 410,000. * The prior week's figure was revised up to 419,000, from the previously reported 415,000. COMMENTS: TOM PORCELLI, U.S. ECONOMIST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, NEW YORK: "It's all an unwind of earlier weather effects. The last several claims reports have not given us a very clear reading on what's happening in the labor market. If you're just using claims to gauge what's going on with the labor market, you're basically flying blind. "I would argue the Treasury market has reacted a bit too much here. Initially, bonds sold off, but you've got to fade this because you're not dealing with anything other than the weather here." VIMOMBI NSHOM, IFR ECONOMICS, A UNIT OF THOMSON REUTERS: "While it is true that claims should be below the 400k-level given improvements in the jobs market, the fact that it had suffered from unanticipated weather distortions -- and will continue in the near term to do so -- means that today's improvement could be mitigated by a couple 'correctional shifts.' The level however will start consistently fall below 380K in the spring." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stock index futures slightly pare losses. BONDS: U.S. government bond futures extend losses. FOREX: The dollar extends gains versus yen and euro.
