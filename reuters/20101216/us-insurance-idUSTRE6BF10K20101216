 LONDON  (Reuters) - Insurance investors hoping to find shelter from Europe's sovereign debt crisis should take refuge in international non-life companies with little exposure to the weaker economies of the euro zone. 

 Insurers invest large chunks of the premiums they receive from customers in government bonds, usually considered risk-free, but now some of these have been hit by the euro zone's debt woes. European insurers hold 1.2 trillion euros ($1,599 billion) of euro zone government bonds, some 17 percent of their financial assets, according to the European Central Bank. "Whenever there's a crisis in a certain asset class the insurers will always get trashed because they are by definition massive asset managers with very geared portfolios," said Joy Ferneyhough, an analyst at stockbroker Execution Noble. Their shares have become a bellwether for investor nervousness about sovereign risk in the single currency area. The Stoxx 600 European insurance share index has recouped most of a 10 percent drop in the run-up to Ireland's bailout last month, but concerns over sovereign creditworthiness will weigh on the sector until the crisis is over, analysts say. They say companies with the smallest holdings of bonds issued by Portugal, Ireland, Greece or Spain -- currently at the center of default fears -- are generally those with no operational presence in those countries. This is because insurers typically hold a country's debt only to the extent that they do business there, using its bonds to provide financial backing against payouts to customers. So problematic sovereign debt is mostly concentrated among local insurers in the issuing countries, and makes up only a small part of the portfolios of big pan-European players. RISK PROFILE Holdings of risky sovereign debt as a proportion of tangible core equity ranges from zero in the case of Britain's RSA, Prudential and Legal & General to 48 percent for Mapfre of Spain, reflecting its focus on its home market, according to analysts at Morgan Stanley. Non-life companies could also prove a safer bet than life insurers because they tend to hold short-dated government debt, seen as less risky than long-dated bonds, to underpin the typically short-term policies they write. "During periods of heightened concerns over sovereign debt we would favor the short-tail, non-life names where the investment portfolios are low-risk and invested in short-dated near-cash instruments," the Morgan Stanley analysts wrote. The Lloyd's of London insurance market, which covers complex, large-scale risks such as hurricanes, also holds virtually no debt from the weaker euro zone countries and offers a good "hideout" from the debt crisis, Execution Noble's Ferneyhough said. The ECB provided some reassurance to investors last week, saying insurers' overall exposure to peripheral eurozone debt appeared "manageable. The sector's shares, up 3.4 percent this year against an 8 percent rise in the wider market, have so far avoided the double-digit falls seen in early 2009 amid worries about a wave of recession-driven corporate bond defaults. UNCERTAINTY WEIGHS Insurers say that as they usually hold bonds to maturity, losses on the value of their sovereign debt portfolios will remain largely unrealized, and they would take a hit only in the event of an actual default by an issuing government. "My conclusion is that it's not a general problem for the European industry. If it is a problem, it's very company specific," Swiss Re chief economist Thomas Hess told Reuters. But the loss of confidence in supposedly risk-free sovereign debt still has worrying implications for insurers, clouding the sector's prospects, analysts say. Intermittent spikes in the yields on bonds issued by other heavily-indebted euro zone states, including Belgium and Italy, demonstrate the potential for the crisis to spread. The industry's exposure is amplified by its holdings of bank bonds, seen as potentially risky in countries where there are doubts about government creditworthiness. European insurers hold 569 billion euros of bank debt, according to the ECB. Government bonds are a cornerstone of insurers' capital, and falls in their value could force them to bolster reserves by more than expected when the European Union's tough new capital rules, known as Solvency II, come into force in 2013. "The big issue the market is confronting is whether sovereign debt is sovereign. If not, the industry is going to have a big problem," said Investec analyst Kevin Ryan. (Editing by  Jane Merriman )
