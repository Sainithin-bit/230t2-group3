 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A proposal by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission that would implement position limits in metals, energy and agricultural contracts had too few votes to support releasing it for public comment, a source with knowledge of the matter said on Thursday. 

 "It appears the chairman did not have the votes to issue a proposal," the source said. CFTC Chairman Gary Gensler, who initially said he supported the proposal, surprised a hearing on the new rules by announcing that he would delay voting on whether to put the package out for 60 days of public comment. A separate vote would still be required to approve the rules. (Reporting by  Christopher Doering ; Editing by  Dale Hudson ) e
