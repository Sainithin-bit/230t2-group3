 BOSTON  (Reuters) - The government's probe into possible insider trading on Wall Street on Thursday resulted in the arrests of four men who have been accused of illegally passing on information to hedge funds. 

 The probe broke into the open in October 2009 when agents arrested the founder of hedge fund firm Galleon Group and nearly two dozen other people. As the probe picked up speed over the last year, the government has focused on expert networking firms and how their consultants may play a role in passing non-public information to investment managers including hedge fund firms. Three of the men arrested on Thursday served as consultants for expert networking firm Primary Global Research and one was an account executive at the firm. Below are some questions and answers on the probe: HOW DID THE INSIDER TRADING PROBE BECOME PUBLIC? In October, 2009 federal agents arrested Galleon Group founder Raj Rajaratnam and charged him with running the largest insider trading scheme involving a hedge fund in decades. Rajaratnam, the government alleged, consulted industry experts, received illegal information and directed trades at Galleon -- which once oversaw $7 billion -- that netted more than $20 million in profits between 2006 and 2009. HOW HAS THE PROBE PICKED UP SPEED? Federal Bureau of Investigation agents fanned across the country, speaking with hedge fund managers and consultants at expert networking firms. In October, their efforts became public when research analyst John Kinnucan sent an email to his contacts saying FBI agents had asked him to wear a wire to record conversations with a hedge fund manager. WHAT HAPPENED NEXT? FBI agents  raided three hedge funds -- Loch Capital Management in Boston, Diamondback Capital Management in Stamford, Connecticut and Level Global Investors in New York on November 22. The Justice Department also sent requests for information to investment managers including hedge funds SAC Capital Advisors and Citadel, and mutual fund firms Janus Capital Group and Wellington Management. Two days later, FBI agents arrested Don Ching Trang Chu, who worked for Primary Global Research. Earlier in the month, FBI agents arrested French doctor Yves Benhamou, who worked for expert network firms, for allegedly having tipped Joseph "Chip" Skowron, a fund manager at hedge fund FrontPoint Partners, on inside information at Human Genome Sciences. FrontPoint laid off Skowron and everyone else who worked on the healthcare fund after investors demanded their money back. WHAT IS AN EXPERT NETWORKING FIRM? Effectively, they are middlemen who bring together industry experts who can offer insight on various businesses to investment managers. Companies like Gerson Lehrman Group, the expert networking industry's biggest player, Coleman Research and GuidePoint Global are used by thousands of hedge fund managers for "channel checking," a long-accepted method of independent research where third parties supply information to the managers. Many hedge funds have strict rules on what kinds of information they can receive from consultants. WHY ARE PROSECUTORS CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR ROLE? Securities laws require that publicly traded companies make "material information" available to all investors equally. Officials fear that hedge funds could get a leg up on other investors by paying expert-network firms for illegal access to non-public information that might net them profits or save them from facing losses. HOW HAS THE GOVERNMENT CHANGED ITS TACTICS ON INVESTIGATING INSIDER TRADING? For years, insider trading probes were conducted mainly by the Securities and Exchange Commission's civil enforcement authority, but in recent months, the SEC has cooperated more closely with the Justice Department, and the government is now using criminal investigation techniques to catch the illegal activity more effectively. In Thursday's complaint, the government said it recorded telephone conversations between cooperating witnesses and the men it arrested. WHY HAS IT BEEN DIFFICULT TO PROVE INSIDER TRADING CASES IN THE PAST: "Insider trading cases are notoriously tough to prove. Without wiretaps or cooperating witnesses to provide direct evidence about what was said during conversations, the government has to rely on circumstantial evidence, such as the timing of phone calls and trades or anomalous trading patterns, which is much weaker and often contradicted by witness testimony and plausible explanations," said Ian Roffman, a former Securities and Exchange Commission lawyer who is now a partner at Nutter McClennen & Fish.
