 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Following are comments by European leaders and senior officials on Thursday at a summit in Brussels focusing on ways to tackle the euro zone debt crisis. 

 Leaders have spent most of 2010 trying to come up with measures to stop the crisis spreading, but it has already forced Greece and Ireland to seek EU bailouts and Portugal, Spain, Belgium and others are now in the spotlight. EU COUNCIL PRESIDENT HERMAN VAN ROMPUY On EFSF: "The present fund has been little used thus far, something like 4 percent of the funding available. So there is no real need to talk about increasing the capacity of the fund." "We have discussed neither the increase of the lending capacity nor more flexibility. It was not one of the themes of our discussion." On supporting the euro: We've got a general sentence where we say the heads of state and government and the euro area and the EU institutions made it clear that they will do whatever is required to ensure the stability of the euro area as a whole, so it is not just about the fund. It's a general statement ... In general terms were ready to do what is necessary to support the stability of the euro area. EUROPEAN COMMISSION PRESIDENT JOSE MANUEL BARROSO "Our task now is to hold course, to walk, not talk, and prove those wrong who predicted the demise of our common currency. In fact the euro -- we have seen it -- is a very stable and strong currency. There are some issues, there are some difficulties, we recognize them ... but we believe there is a strong currency." On Portugal's anti-crisis measures: "We believe that they are very important measures taken by the Portuguese authorities in terms of a very ambitious target for next year's budget. Not only apparently Portugal will fulfill its commitments regarding this year's deficit but Portugal has announced very important and courageous measures for next year's budget. " GERMAN CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL "We have agreed important steps. On the one hand, we have agreed a permanent crisis mechanism. That is important because with this step we commit to secure the stability of the euro." EURO GROUP CHAIRMAN JEAN-CLAUDE JUNCKER "The decision taken was that there will be no enlargement or deepening of the funding means at the disposal of the EFSF." EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK PRESIDENT JEAN-CLAUDE TRICHET "The governing council has judged it appropriate to take that possibility which was open since a long period of time to have the possibility of embarking on additional provisioning. So that's the way we look at it." Trichet said the decision to increase ECB capital was made "taking into account the volatility of markets" FRENCH DELEGATION SOURCE On eurobonds proposal: "The subject was brought up over dinner and it was discarded by the heads of state and government ... This idea did not get a consensus. " EU COUNCIL PRESIDENT HERMAN VAN ROMPUY "We are strengthening all our mechanisms. If needed, inside the euro zone, we can go further in terms of policy coordination and we can do it without treaty changes." "We have a strategy based on three principles: fiscal responsibility, stimulating growth and, thirdly, that the two countries with support programs (Greece and Ireland) are forcibly implementing their programs." "The heads of state and government of the euro zone stand ready to do whatever is necessary to ensure the stability of the euro zone as a whole. The political will of all member states and institutions to do whatever needs to be done is beyond doubt. On possibility of needing a referendum to secure the ESM: "To our knowledge there is no referendum needed." EUROPEAN COMMISSION PRESIDENT JOSE MANUEL BARROSO "Today was a good day for Europe. I believe we have done what we needed to do." "Everyone around the table showed determination to do what it takes to protect the euro. We are united on this. There is a common resolve to ensure Europe comes out of this crisis stronger."
