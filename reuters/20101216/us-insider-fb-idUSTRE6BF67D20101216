 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Technology executives and a salesman were arrested and charged on Thursday with leaking confidential information about companies including Apple Inc. 

 Here's a look at some of the publicly traded companies involved in the scandal. * Flextronics International Flextronics supplied camera and charger components to Apple for its iPhone and iPod, according to the complaint. In 2009, Walter Shimoon, a senior director of business development, allegedly told a hedge fund about plans for the iPad. Shimoon, who participated in contract negotiations with Apple, placed calls to hedge funds on his cell phone, prosecutors said. In those calls, some of which investigators said they monitored, he talked about sales figures for iPods and iPhones, and said the upcoming iPhone would have two cameras. In November 2009, Shimoon told a hedge fund employee, "that would really suck if you recorded all the calls." * Dell Inc A former Dell global supply manager, Daniel DeVore, pleaded guilty to wire fraud and conspiracy charges on December 10. Court documents show that he passed on information about the company's sales figures. Dell said DeVore was no longer with the company. * Advanced Micro Devices Inc A supply chain manager, Anthony Longoria, gave out revenue information, average sales prices, product sales figures and gross margin information to an unidentified hedge fund. He received some topline revenue numbers on the chipmaker from a friend who worked in AMD's finance department. He leaked the tips to Richard Choo-Beng Lee, a hedge fund manager who has been cooperating with the investigators. * Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co A manager, Manosha Karunatilaka, provided product sales and shipping information to hedge funds and financial analysts. He also provided semiconductor orders data. Some of the telephone calls he made were routed through the FBI. (Compiled by Liana B. Baker and Ritsuko Ando. Editing by Robert MacMillan)
