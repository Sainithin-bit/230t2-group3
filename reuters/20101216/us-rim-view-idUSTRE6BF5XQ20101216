 TORONTO  (Reuters) - BlackBerry maker Research In Motion's net profit jumped 45 percent in its fiscal third quarter, boosted by strong sales of its flagship Torch smartphone. 

 COMMENTARY: SHAW WU, ANALYST, KAUFMAN BROS, SAN FRANCISCO "The results look pretty good. For the current quarter they definitely benefited from some new products. They announced the Pearl 3G, the BlackBerry Style and also the BlackBerry Torch." "The guidance also looks quite strong. I think you're seeing the stock kind of yo-yo a bit. It actually sold off and now it's up again. One of the concerns that we have, that many investors have is the guidance is strong, but I think there is some concern that it could be too optimistic perhaps because of the ongoing pressure, particularly from Android, in international markets." ED SNYDER, ANALYST, CHARTER EQUITY RESEARCH, SAN FRANCISCO "The results look very good actually, well above what analysts were estimating for the quarter and the guidance looks even better for the next quarter. ... At first glance this looks very positive." MATTHEW THORNTON, SENIOR ANALYST, AVIAN SECURITIES, BOSTON "The only blemish in the current quarter was really the subscriber adds were a little light, but in terms of the outlook, revenue and EPS guidance are both ahead so this is a better report than most thought. "I think international (growth) has been a story for them for some time. This quarter actually was probably a little more balanced (between North America and international), but I think going forward international is the driver." MIKE BURTON, SENIOR ANALYST, FBN SECURITIES, NEW YORK "We're expecting that we're going to see analysts taking their numbers up tomorrow." (Reporting by  Alex Dobuzinskis  and  Euan Rocha )
