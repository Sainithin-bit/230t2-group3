 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Thursday released a long-awaited proposal to set position limits in commodity markets. 

 The agency took heed of fierce objections raised by Wall Street since it first put forward a plan to cap the influx of investor capital that some blamed for driving oil and grain prices to record highs in 2008. But the core principle was unchanged: restricting the number of swaps and futures contracts that speculators can hold in energy, metals and agricultural derivative markets, a rule it estimated could affect nearly 80 agricultural traders and dozens of metals and energy players. The new rules are subject to a 60-day public comment period. ANALYST AND TRADER COMMENTS: TIM EVANS, ENERGY ANALYST, CITI FUTURES PERSPECTIVE, NEW YORK: "The general framework for basing position limits on the size of the market makes sense, but it's difficult to guage whether the proposed levels are the right ones. And I guess that it's also safe to assume that the levels will be adjusted in the light of actual experience going forward in real time." JOHN DAMGARD, PRESIDENT OF THE FUTURES INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION: "It's better to get this right than to get it done quickly. Even people on both sides of the isle have indicated that some of these deadlines aren't realistic, and the next Congress may very well take a good, long look at the implementation issues." "I know (CFTC Chairman Gary) Gensler's got to be stressed, and I know the agency's stressed, but from our standpoint we're trying to get a broad consensus in order to be helpful. What with people not being around over the holidays, it's going to be impossible for us to get our comment letters in. "Some consideration of a little extra time would perhaps serve everybody, on a number of these rulemakings. We would hope that Mr. Gensler would agree with that." MICHAEL GREENBERGER, LAW PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND AND FORMER HIGH-RANKING CFTC OFFICIAL: "It's encouraging that they got the proposal out because there had been rumors they wouldn't have the votes. The rules themselves mirror the proposal from January but apply to a broader base because of Dodd-Frank obligations on aggregation." "The CFTC is taking a reasonable step here designed to stabilize economic function and keep past failures of commodities markets from occurring again. It's a complex proposal but it's in the ballpark of imposing restraints that industrial companies want." "If there are excessive loopholes, I think those will be addressed as time goes on. The delays to impose new rules are not something that give me too much concern. The voices we have heard sounding off about this are often of traders or banks, but remember that industrial companies who wanted these reforms will keep pushing hard for them." "There are signs everywhere that commodities markets are heating up again, and that speculators have enormous positions adding a speculative premium to prices. I think these rules will eventually restrain the growth of exchange-traded funds and notes and commodity index swaps." "Although the crowding-out provision has been removed, that is something that may still be contested."
