 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - First-time claims for jobless benefits were essentially unchanged in the latest week, cementing a recent downward trend that remains too modest to bring down unemployment. Housing starts rose slightly more than expected in November, but a surprise drop in permits for future home construction to a 1-1/2 year low indicated continued weakness in the housing market even as the economic recovery gains traction. 

 KEY POINTS: * Initial claims dipped slightly to 420,000 in the week ended December 11, matching the median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists, from a revised 423,000 in the prior week. * However, continuing claims, which exclude the millions of Americans relying on extended benefits, rose to 4.14 million in the week ended December 4. * That was far higher than the reading of 4.07 million analysts had expected, and the prior week's figure was also revised up considerably. * The Commerce Department said on Thursday housing starts rose 3.9 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 555,000 units. * October's starts were revised up to a 534,000-unit pace from the previously reported 1-1/2 year low rate of 519,000 units. * Analysts polled by Reuters had expected housing starts to rise to a 550,000-unit rate. COMMENTS: RICHARD DEKASER, ECONOMIST, THE PANTHENON GROUP, BOSTON: JOBLESS CLAIMS: "This confirms the downtrend we have enjoyed in the past month, which is consistent with a six-figure monthly increase in payrolls going forward. The improvement is very welcomed and encouraging, but it's insufficient to substantially bring down the high jobless rate. We need to see the four-week average to go below 400,000 for bigger job growth." HOUSING STARTS: "The November figure is finally giving us a clean reading in the post-tax-incentive environment. Moving ahead, we should not see further decline, but rather more bumping along the bottom. "Higher mortgage rates will hurt housing demand. We were at the most affordable period in housing in history just two months ago. But if credit availability increases, for example, that could blunt the effect of higher rates." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stock index futures hold onto slight gains. BONDS: U.S. Treasury bond prices maintain slight gains. FOREX: The dollar holds losses against the euro and the yen
