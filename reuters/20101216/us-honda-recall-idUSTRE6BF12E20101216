 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co said on Thursday it would recall about 1.35 million Fit subcompacts globally to repair defective wiring in the headlights. 

 No accident was reported from the defect, a Honda spokesman in Tokyo said. Subject to the recall are Fit cars built at Honda's Suzuka factory in Japan between November 2001 and October 2007. About 735,000 units will be recalled in Japan, where the Fit is the second most popular car behind Toyota Motor Corp's Prius, excluding 660cc minivehicles. Honda will also recall 143,000 Fits exported to the United States, and 385,000 units in Europe, where the model is called the Jazz. The car will also be recalled in the Middle East, Africa and Asia. In Japan, the recall will cost about 3.6 billion yen ($43 million) and will have negligible impact on Honda's earnings, the spokesman said. (Reporting by  Chang-Ran Kim ; Editing by  Chris Gallagher )
