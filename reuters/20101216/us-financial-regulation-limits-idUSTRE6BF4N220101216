 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Thursday released a long-awaited proposal to set position limits in commodity markets. 

 The agency took heed of fierce objections raised by Wall Street since it first put forward a plan to cap the influx of investor capital that some blamed for driving oil and grain prices to record highs in 2008. But the core principle was unchanged: restricting the number of swaps and futures contracts that speculators can hold in energy, metals and agricultural derivative markets, a rule it estimated could affect nearly 80 agricultural traders and dozens of metals and energy players. The new rules are subject to a 60-day public comment period. ANALYST AND TRADER COMMENTS: TIM EVANS, ENERGY ANALYST, CITI FUTURES PERSPECTIVE, NEW YORK: "The general framework for basing position limits on the size of the market makes sense, but it's difficult to gauge whether the proposed levels are the right ones. And I guess that it's also safe to assume that the levels will be adjusted in the light of actual experience going forward in real time." JOHN DAMGARD, PRESIDENT OF THE FUTURES INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION: "It's better to get this right than to get it done quickly. Even people on both sides of the isle have indicated that some of these deadlines aren't realistic, and the next Congress may very well take a good, long look at the implementation issues." "I know (CFTC Chairman Gary) Gensler's got to be stressed, and I know the agency's stressed, but from our standpoint we're trying to get a broad consensus in order to be helpful. What with people not being around over the holidays, it's going to be impossible for us to get our comment letters in. "Some consideration of a little extra time would perhaps serve everybody, on a number of these rulemakings. We would hope that Mr. Gensler would agree with that." MICHAEL GREENBERGER, LAW PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND AND FORMER HIGH-RANKING CFTC OFFICIAL: "It's encouraging that they got the proposal out because there had been rumors they wouldn't have the votes. The rules themselves mirror the proposal from January but apply to a broader base because of Dodd-Frank obligations on aggregation." "The CFTC is taking a reasonable step here designed to stabilize economic function and keep past failures of commodities markets from occurring again. It's a complex proposal but it's in the ballpark of imposing restraints that industrial companies want." "If there are excessive loopholes, I think those will be addressed as time goes on. The delays to impose new rules are not something that give me too much concern. The voices we have heard sounding off about this are often of traders or banks, but remember that industrial companies who wanted these reforms will keep pushing hard for them." "There are signs everywhere that commodities markets are heating up again, and that speculators have enormous positions adding a speculative premium to prices. I think these rules will eventually restrain the growth of exchange-traded funds and notes and commodity index swaps." "Although the crowding-out provision has been removed, that is something that may still be contested." DENNIS GARTMAN, THE GARTMAN LETTER, VIRGINIA: "I am fearful of whatever (CFTC Commissioner) Bart Chilton has to say. Knowing he came from the Farmers Union, which has historically had an invalidly anti-futures and more properly, an anti-derivatives philosophy, I am always concerned about what Mr. Chilton has to say. "I am glad they have decided to take a slower turn ... that they are not being as overtly destructive as I feared they might ... Deferring (the) final decision is absolutely the right thing to do. "They are taking baby steps rather than giant steps, and baby steps are always better. I congratulate the CFTC for taking a much slower movement than they might otherwise, and what I might have otherwise feared." MATTHEW BRADBARB, FOUNDER OF COMMODITY BROKERAGE MB WEALTH CORP IN FLORIDA "Bottom line, when the government gets involved in the market it's not a good thing. In the short-term it's very unlikely to have any impact on how the market operates, as anybody worth their salt has already been reducing positions into the end of the year. "But it will be interesting to see if the market changes at all on January 1." CRAIG PIRRONG, FINANCE PROFESSOR, UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON, COMMENTING IN THE REUTERS MESSAGING COMMODITY FORUMS: "In the current environment, where there are concerns that big financial firms will utilize 'client-facing business' as a way of camouflaging prop trading, I presume that there is sentiment on the Commission to be very strict in the differentiation (of hedging on behalf of clients and prop trading). "That's the kind of area, though, that the new political landscape could influence. If the Commission is overly strict, unreasonable, or appears to be in the eyes of the banks, etc, there will be a more sympathetic ear in Congress in the coming months. That is likely to induce the Commission to be somewhat more circumspect in how it enforces this distinction." CHAD HART, AGRICULTURE ECONOMIST AT IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY: "They are being sensitive and trying not to be overly restrictive on these markets. Holding off on the crowding rule -- that's part of what they're doing here. They recognize that any time you start to talk about position limits, you do get some movement in the markets that you might not be crazy about. "Just the rumor of position limits has changed how some of our speculators play within the market. This is the CFTC trying to stick to the letter of the law -- in that they are trying to implement what they can -- but at the same time ease their way into the rule making process with the market, recognizing that the markets are kind of jittery about whatever comes down the line." BILL O'GRADY, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CONFLUENCE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT IN ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI: "There's enough weasel room in these regulations to not kill the ETF business. "Had the CFTC gone after the ETFs (exchange traded fund), the ETFs would have bought physical assets, like grain elevators. "Speculators were not the problem, and I believe the CFTC understood that. The problem has been the U.S. monetary policy, which has had the effect of pushing more money into commodities on inflation worries. "The more complicated these regulations are, the more likely that all kinds of exemptions are built in." GEORGE GERO, VICE PRESIDENT, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS GLOBAL FUTURES, NEW YORK: "The key questions are who and what will be hedge exemptions? That's a major point. The other thing I am not clear on is what will be the treatment of ETFs. "They are talking about 25 percent of deliverable supply, but the question is what is deliverable supply? There are more questions than answers at this point. "Whenever there is indecision, or insecurity, or confusion in the markets, people tend to take some money off the table." JOHN KILDUFF, PARTNER AT AGAIN CAPITAL LLC IN NEW YORK: "Relief on the 'look-through' and the 'crowding out' will certainly benefit the banks and the various energy companies that engage in 'hedge-ulation'. "However, their participation is necessary for the markets to remain robust and liquid. The market needs more liquidity not less. "I think most market participants can operate within these limits, but look for more combinations involving traditional commodity producers and trading firms in order to avail themselves of the 'crowding out' exemption." SCOTT IRWIN, UNIVERSITY of IllINOIS ECONOMIST: "From the ag side I would put the new rules in the 'be careful what you wish for' category. "The main ag implication revolves around the eventual aggregation of swap positions related to index investments. This is unlikely to impact traditional speculators in ag markets much." BOB FITZSIMMONS, HEAD OF THE DERIVATIVES BUSINESS At INVESTMENT TECHNOLOGY GROUP: "I think it plays into the hands of trade associations, they're largely getting what they want. It largely comes at the detriment of the marketplace and price discovery. Any time you limit the amount of activity it just hurts the price discovery process." "You deal with the new reality, you kind of swallow the pill, but then look for an opportunity to undo it (position limits)." "I think people are waiting for the change of the guard in Congress, and then certainly using that leverage to persuade Commissioners to revisit this issue." JEREMY CHARLESWORTH, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER AT MOONRAKER FUND MANAGEMENT IN LONDON: "All a hedge fund has to do is set up subsidiary hedge funds, each a different entity, then put on the same position that works out at 10 percent but they comply with the rules. I think the industry will find a way round it." "I can see why the regulators think that placing these limits will be helpful in maintaining an orderly market, but people might breach the limits by mistake. For example, if someone takes a 9.9 percent position and the contract rolls, and not everyone rolls but you do, you'll be in breach of the regulations despite your best intentions of remaining within the limits. "The 10 percent limit will affect the banks and the very large hedge funds the most, but they are clever enough to find ways of getting round it." (Editing by  Alden Bentley  and  Dale Hudson )
