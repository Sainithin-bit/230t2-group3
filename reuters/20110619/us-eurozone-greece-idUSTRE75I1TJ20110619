 LUXEMBOURG  (Reuters) - Euro zone finance ministers and officials were meeting on Sunday evening to discuss financial support for Greece. 

 Following are highlights of their comments ahead of the talks: GREEK FINANCE MINISTER EVANGELOS VENIZELOS: "It is a great opportunity for me to repeat the strong commitment of the Greek government and the strong will of the Greek people for the implementation of the program. "We can achieve our target, thanks to the efforts of our people, and thanks to the cooperation and the assistance of our partners." GERMAN FINANCE MINISTER WOLFGANG SCHAEUBLE ASKED IF EURO ZONE AND IMF ARE READY TO RELEASE NEXT GREEK AID TRANCHE: "We will work today and tomorrow so that we get as far as possible. "We know that we need a prompt decision, but a decision is not (for this meeting) here, but up to Athens. Greece must fulfill all the necessary preconditions so that it can be paid out on time. Europe will do its part. "We are prepared to help Greece and give it the time it needs." DUTCH FINANCE MINISTER JAN KEES DE JAGER ASKED IF A SECOND GREEK PROGRAMME EXPECTED TO BE AGREED SUNDAY: "Probably not. If the Dutch demands are met, yes, but I don't think today they will be all met. It will be very difficult."
