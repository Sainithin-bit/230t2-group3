 BERLIN  (Reuters) - Germany does not agree with comments from a regional premier who said that federal and state governments had agreed to provide aid only to Canada's Magna and not a rival bidder for carmaker Opel. 

 Asked on Friday if Berlin supported the comments by Thuringia state premier Dieter Althaus, spokesman Klaus Vater said: "No." (Writing by  Noah Barkin )
