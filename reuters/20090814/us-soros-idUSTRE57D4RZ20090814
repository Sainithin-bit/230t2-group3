 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Billionaire investor and philanthropist George Soros' Soros Fund Management reported holdings of $4.2 billion at the end of the second quarter after cutting its stake in a number of retailers. 

 The New York-based fund firm cut its stakes in retailer Wal-Mart Stores ( WMT.N ) and drugstore chain Walgreen Co ( WAG.N ) during the quarter after boosting its position in Walgreen in the first quarter, according to a regulatory filing made on Friday. The firm also cut its stake in Lowe's Cos Inc ( LOW.N ) to 579,000 shares from 5.4 million shares. The firm also took a stake in Bank of America ( BAC.N ), whose share price has climbed 20.74 percent since January, at a time when many financial companies appear to be recovering from last year's sharp declines. Soros took new positions in computer maker Dell Inc DELL.O and drug company Pfizer Inc ( PFE.N ). The fund made its moves at a time when the broader stock market was rallying on hopes that the global downturn would soon end. (Reporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss; Editing by  Richard Chang )
