 SOCHI, RUSSIA  (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Germany had made clear to Russia it has a "strong preference" for Canadian automotive group Magna to take over carmaker General Motor's European Unit Opel. 

 Merkel was speaking after talks with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev in the Black Sea resort of Sochi. Discussions on Opel's future had now reached a decisive phase, she said on Friday, adding that she hoped for a decision "as soon as possible." (Writing by  Dave Graham )
