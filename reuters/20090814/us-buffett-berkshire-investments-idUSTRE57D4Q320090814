 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Billionaire Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc ( BRKa.N ) ( BRKb.N ) reported on Friday a new 1.2 million share investment in Becton Dickinson & Co ( BDX.N ) and an increased stake in Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ.N ), as it boosted exposure to some health-care companies. 

 In a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing reporting U.S.-listed equity holdings, Berkshire reported a 1.2 million share stake valued at $85.6 million as of June 30 in Becton, a Franklin Lakes, New Jersey-based maker of syringes and medical devices. Becton shares rose 1.7 percent following the after-hours disclosure. Berkshire also in the second quarter added 4.41 million shares of Johnson & Johnson, whose products include Band-Aids, shampoo and complex biotechnology medicines. That boosted its stake 14 percent to 36.91 million shares, valued at $2.1 billion as of June 30. In addition, Berkshire reported lower stakes in a half-dozen companies including health insurers UnitedHealth Group Inc ( UNH.N ) and WellPoint Inc ( WLP.N ). "He recognizes that global growth is what is going to drive future returns, so if you look at health-care companies being put in the portfolio, it is more global pharmaceutical and diversified medical," said Michael Yoshikami, president of YCMNET Advisors in Walnut Creek, California, which he said invests $800 million and owns Berkshire stock. The value of Berkshire's portfolio of U.S.-listed equities grew 20 percent from the first quarter to $48.95 billion from $40.87 billion. Shares of two of Buffett's biggest holdings, American Express Co ( AXP.N ) and Wells Fargo & Co ( WFC.N ), respectively rose 71 percent and 70 percent in the quarter. Berkshire, based in Omaha, Nebraska, has been reducing its stock purchases and making more fixed-income investments. Last week, Berkshire said it sold a net $254 million of stock and bought a net $1.93 billion of fixed-income securities in the quarter. It also invested $3 billion to help Dow Chemical Co ( DOW.N ) buy chemicals company Rohm & Haas Co. Berkshire has in the last year bought convertible securities, preferred stock and debt issued by General Electric Co ( GE.N ), Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ), reinsurer Swiss Re RUKN.VX, motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson Inc ( HOG.N ) and jewelry maker Tiffany & Co ( TIF.N ), all yielding at least 10 percent. SEVERAL STAKES REDUCED Friday's SEC filing includes investments made by various Berkshire subsidiaries, so it may not be the case that Buffett himself is making particular investments. Buffett does not publicly discuss what he is buying and selling. It also excludes investments that Buffett may want to keep secret. The SEC occasionally gives him permission to delay disclosing investment activity so investors cannot copy him while he is still buying and selling. Berkshire also disclosed lowered stakes in Carmax Inc ( KMX.N ), ConocoPhillips ( COP.N ), Eaton Corp ( ETN.N ) and Home Depot Inc ( HD.N ) as of June 30 compared with March 31. The company has since reported sales of more Conoco stock and part of its stock holdings in credit rater Moody's Corp ( MCO.N ). Buffett has transformed Berkshire since 1965 into a roughly $157 billion conglomerate with close to 80 companies selling such things as candy, car insurance, ice cream and underwear. Berkshire Class A shares closed on Friday down $750 at $101,400 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel and Lilla Zuill; editing by Carol Bishopric)
