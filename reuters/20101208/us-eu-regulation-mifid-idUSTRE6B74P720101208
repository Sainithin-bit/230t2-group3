 LONDON  (Reuters) - European Union plans to shine a stronger light on off-exchange trading may not threaten its existence as some banks feared, but will spark an inevitable shrinkage of some business in favor of bourses. 

 The EU's financial services chief Michel Barnier outlined a sweeping overhaul of the markets in financial instruments directive (MiFID) on Wednesday. MiFID comprises a set of rules introduced in November 2007 that have injected fierce competition into share trading. A key aim of Barnier is to toughen up the rules for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives and share trading, which does not at present have to meet MiFID's more stringent transparency rules such as publishing share prices ahead of a trade. Moving OTC derivatives onto exchanges such as Deutsche Boerse's Eurex or NYSE Euronext Liffe or other platforms would become the norm under Barnier's plans as regulators want a clear trail for each trade to spot abuses. Exchange trading is seen as being less risky and means transactions can be centrally cleared to cut risk even further. This raises questions over the future role of the OTC sector and whether it will shrink under the glare of more transparency and tougher rules that will leave investors concluding they may as well trade on an exchange. OTC trading, either between or within banks or via anonymous "dark pool" platforms, has expanded in recent years and some exchanges have suggested the OTC market in shares is as much as 40 percent of the total, though banks argue this figure includes faulty figures and double counting. "It is unclear how much of the market the Commission is seeking to move onto organized venues and whether this will be beneficial," said Mark Hart, managing director for the Association for Financial Markets in Europe, a banking lobby. "One of the few certainties is that it will take choice away from investors," Hart said. NEW CATEGORY So far the plans are not as draconian as banks had feared. Barnier wants to create a new regulatory category to directly capture in-house trading, though exchanges fear this will spur banks to find ways round it, just as they did with a similar category in the original MiFID. Judith Hardt, secretary general of the Federation of European Securities Exchanges (FESE), said Brussels is finally acknowledging so much trading takes place outside MiFID rules but setting OTC in-house trading volume limits won't do the trick. "The fundamental flaw is that it doesn't apply the same rules to the same business," Hardt said. The on-exchange and OTC sectors have jostled side by side for centuries, with some experts saying both are needed as they meet different investor requirements. Chi-X Europe, which exploited MiFID to become one of the biggest organized trading venues in Europe, said Barnier's plans to clamp down on high-frequency or computerized trading could even send some exchange business into the OTC sector. "A minimum order expiry period for trading, that would be a fundamental change. It is asking people to take on more risk in an uncontrolled fashion," said Denzil Jenkins, Chi-X Europe's director of regulation. "That will clearly have a very material impact on the cost of using markets and on the dividing line between OTC and on-exchange," Jenkins said. Making it harder for non-exchange trading venues to avoid MiFID's pre-trade transparency rules may compound this effect. "That will have a material impact on whether business gets done on OTC or on an exchange. If regulators want to move business onto exchanges, you have to make it more attractive and this flies in the face of that," Jenkins added. EU governments and the European Parliament will approve the changes once formally presented in legislative form next summer and they could take effect in 2012. (Editing by  David Holmes )
