 PARIS  (Reuters) - President Nicolas Sarkozy has let German Chancellor Angela Merkel do most of the talking on the euro crisis, but is working behind the scenes to moderate Berlin and avoid scaring financial markets, French officials say. 

 Normally the more outspoken half of Europe's Franco-German motor, Sarkozy has largely kept quiet in recent months to avoid clashing with Merkel, who has taken a tough line in demanding that the private sector share the pain of future bailouts. Paris has sought instead to soften Germany's stance to reassure investors about the solidity of the single currency bloc and keep any concerns at bay about the safety of its own cherished AAA credit rating. "France has the G20 presidency and we cannot afford to fall out with our main partner," said one government source, adding: "We realize that the Germans have problems with public opinion, but this flurry of public comments has not helped." With German taxpayers angry at the prospect of bailing out spendthrift European partners, Merkel's insistence on the need for the private sector to share part of the pain has rattled not only financial markets but some of her European colleagues. Ireland's prime minister blamed her for aggravating Dublin's debt crisis and Greece's premier said her stance could "break backs" and force countries toward bankruptcy. A deal struck by Merkel and Sarkozy in Deauville in October on a permanent debt resolution mechanism that might eventually force private sovereign bondholders to take losses was a key factor in sending Ireland's borrowing costs through the roof. With a fresh Franco-German summit on Friday, the last thing Paris wants is fan another brushfire in markets. So aside from a few generic statements on the euro's credibility, Sarkozy has kept an unusually low profile in recent days. "The Franco-German alliance was the genesis of the EU and the driving force behind so many of its accomplishments so France's relative silence at such a crucial time is a little bit surprising," said Larry Hatheway, global chief economist at UBS. Sarkozy appeared to have won a victory in Deauville when he secured Merkel's agreement to retain some political discretion over sanctions on governments that break EU deficit limits, reducing any risk of Brussels meddling in French fiscal affairs. He was caught on the hop, however, when their joint plan for an EU crisis resolution mechanism led to a widening of euro zone bond spreads, including France's. French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde said Sarkozy had succeeded in convincing Merkel to drop her insistence on automatic private sector involvement any financial rescue after 2013. Instead it will be subject to case-by-case assessment. "France is trying and succeeding in being Germany's partner," said Jean Pisani-Ferry, director of the Bruegel economic think tank in Brussels and a former French adviser. "But it doesn't take the initiative, it moderates German ideas." FRANCE MORE MARKET SENSITIVE? Sarkozy and Merkel, who have conferred frequently by telephone throughout the crisis, will meet on Friday in the western German town of Freiburg, ahead of a European leaders summit in Brussels next week due to discuss the EU budget. For Henrik Uterwedde, deputy head of the Franco-German Institute, while there is broad agreement on the need to strengthen the euro zone, differences in approach persist. Germany strongly rejected calls for an increase in the 750 billion euro EU-IMF stabilization fund (EFSF), although French officials appear more open to it. "Anything that reinforces the means of expression of our financial solidarity in Europe is good," said another source close to the French government, asked about an increase in the EFSF. "It would also mean the IMF would contribute more." Paris, which lobbied successfully for the inclusion of southern European countries when the euro was launched in 1999, sees itself as a link between the interests of these Mediterranean countries and the group's northern core. Germany's robust post-war growth and strong deutschemark meant it never had to face fierce market pressures, while French officials still remember battling the markets in the 1990s in the run up to European monetary union. "Germany has never had to justify itself to the markets in this way. The French are much more sensitive to the markets," said Gilles Moec, senior European economist with Deutsche Bank. Despite differences, both governments recognize they need each other to make Europe succeed. Speaking at the presentation of an economic award to German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble in Paris recently, Lagarde noted the single currency was not just an economic project but a political one. "Sarkozy and Merkel are not a dream team, far from it," Uterwedde said. "But they share a vision of a strong Europe and they know that if they do not stick together, if they are not able to compromise, then Europe will not work."
