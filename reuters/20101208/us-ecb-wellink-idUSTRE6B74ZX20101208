 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Issuing joint euro zone government bonds would not be a transparent method of debt burden sharing in Europe's 16-nation single currency area, European Central Bank governing council member Nout Wellink said on Wednesday. 

 "One of the reasons I am very much against it is that it is an implicit transfer of money to other countries," Wellink told reporters. "It takes away also incentives to behave better because of the financing umbrella of dominant powers." Bickering among European Union leaders escalated on Wednesday over a proposal for joint euro zone bonds to overcome the bloc's debt crisis, with Germany saying it opposed the idea on legal and economic grounds. It was essential that all countries enforce budget consolidation programs and that it was up to national authorities and not the ECB to do this, Wellink said. He also expected the United States to implement Basel III, the new global bank capital and liquidity rules drawn up by the Basel Committee, which Wellink chairs. The United States has yet to fully implement the accord's predecessor, and Basel III is due to be introduced from 2013. Wellink also said he would like to see banks hold higher levels of capital immediately but feared this would kill economic recovery. "Banks would probably overdo it. It (phasing in new regulation) is a balancing act," Wellink said. (Reporting by  Sakari Suoninen )
