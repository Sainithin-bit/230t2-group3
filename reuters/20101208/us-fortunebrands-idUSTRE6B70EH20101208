 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Fortune Brands Inc FO.N, owner of the Jim Beam liquor business, plans to split the company into three separate businesses under a plan approved by its board, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday citing people familiar with the matter. 

 The paper said Fortune intends to spin off its home and security unit to shareholders in a tax-free transaction and to either sell or spin off its golf unit. It also reported that Fortune Brands would remain an independent publicly traded company focused on liquor brands. The plans are expected to be announced as soon as Wednesday, according to the paper. Fortune Brands was not immediately available for comment. (Reporting by  Yinka Adegoke )
