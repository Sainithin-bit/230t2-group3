 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Top home improvement chain Home Depot Inc ( HD.N ) projected a modest rise in earnings next year and outlined steps it was taking to boost its online business and improve customer service in a lackluster economy. 

 For the 12 months ending January 2012, the company on Wednesday gave a forecast that calls for earnings of $2.19 to $2.23, helped by share repurchases, up from the $1.97 it now expects in the current fiscal year. Analysts on average were expecting a $2.22 a share next year, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company sees sales rising 2 percent to 2.5 percent in the period. Shares of Home Depot were up 1.3 percent to $33.98 in early afternoon trading. "I think the topline outlook is realistic and first half will likely be more challenging, but (the) margin outlook looks conservative given supply chain benefits," Bernstein analyst Colin McGranahan said. "I think the company is very focused on driving transactions and market share with good initiatives to do so. Recent comp performance relative to Lowe's shows they are making progress," McGranahan added. At a meeting with investors and analysts on Wednesday, Home Depot said it will step up its online business and provide store associates with devices that let them answer in-store customer queries faster. The retailer will launch a service next year that allows shoppers to buy online and pick up purchased products in store, Chief Financial Officer Carol Tome said in an interview on Wednesday. "The customer is changing... customers are shopping with their phones," Tome said. Last week, smaller rival Lowe's Cos ( LOW.N ) announced plans to expand its product assortment online, launch a mobile shopping site next month and start an "ask & answer" service in early 2011 to better serve its online shoppers. CHANGING ONLINE TREND While most retailers for years have relied heavily on their Websites for sales, home improvement chains have seen their customers mostly using the sites to learn more about products before heading to a brick-and-mortar store to make a purchase. The trend is changing, however, as both Baby Boomers, a big customer segment for home improvement retail, as well as younger shoppers, increasingly scour websites for bargains and get comfortable with the idea of buying home goods online. Online sales are often more profitable for retailers as they involve less overhead and other costs. "Top line trends continue to languish in the home improvement sector," Oppenheimer's Brian Nagel said. "We are nonetheless encouraged with the aggressive efforts of Home Depot and its competitor to adapt to a weaker demand environment near term." Nagel expects sales in the sector to gradually rebound over the next several quarters. Home Depot's current fiscal year earnings estimate was up three cents from the $1.94 it gave previously. "November was a terrific selling month for us. The trends continue into December," Tome said. The home improvement retailer saw strength across the store in November, not just in holiday season items, Tome said.
