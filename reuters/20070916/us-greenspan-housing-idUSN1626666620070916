 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said on Sunday U.S. home prices have not yet hit bottom but turmoil in housing and credit markets does not look like it will produce a broader economic downturn. 

 "There is an underlying strength in the United States," he said in an interview on the CBS program "60 Minutes." "And indeed, when you look around the world, even with this extraordinary credit problem, the economies seem to be holding up. But for the moment it does not look sufficiently severe that it will spiral into anything deeper," he said, according to a transcript made available before air time. Greenspan, who stepped down as chair of the Federal Reserve in January 2006 after more than 18 years at the helm of the U.S. central bank, is giving interviews to promote his memoir, "The Age of Turbulence: Adventures in a New World," which is being published on Monday. Greenspan warned in the  interview that it won't be clear for a while whether the housing downturn and turmoil in credit markets from a wave of delinquencies among mortgages to borrowers with blemished credit will hurt the broader economy  or not.
