 LONDON  (Reuters) - Embattled British bank Northern Rock NRK.L is preparing for a sell-off that could see its 100 billion pound ($200 billion) mortgage portfolio divided between the country's other major banks, the Sunday Telegraph newspaper said. 

 A funding crisis at Britain's fifth-biggest mortgage lender has seen its savers withdraw an estimated 1.5 billion pounds in the last two days, raising fears it will need more help than the emergency funding pledged by the government on Friday. Fears are also rising that the bank's woes could have wider economic, housing market and political consequences if not addressed quickly. A plan under discussion between government and Bank of England officials was effectively a private sector rescue of the lender, involving other banks and the central bank, the Sunday Telegraph said. The BoE and Northern Rock declined to comment on the report. Industry sources said such a plan was an option, but were not aware such an arrangement was imminent. "If the run on deposits looks out of control, Northern Rock would effectively be nationalized and put into administration so it could be wound down," the Sunday Telegraph quoted an official as saying. The paper quoted a source close to Northern Rock as saying if its shares fall heavily again on Monday then a fast break-up and sale of its assets "looks inevitable". Northern Rock's shares tumbled 31 percent on Friday and are down 60 percent this year, valuing the bank at 2 billion pounds. Customers withdrew about 1 billion pounds from Northern Rock on Friday, according to people familiar with the situation, and industry sources estimated at least another 500 million pounds was taken out on Saturday. That would mean about 6 percent of the bank's 24 billion pounds in deposits had been taken out over the two days, and more customers were expected to close accounts on Monday. QUEUES The bank, regulators and politicians have urged calm, but thousands of its 1.4 million savers have queued for hours or attempted to withdraw funds via the company's Web site, which has had problems handling the demand. The FSA said Northern Rock remained solvent and there was no problem with the bank's ability to meet withdrawals. The BoE, as lender of last resort, on Friday stepped in to offer emergency funding to Northern Rock after the bank struggled to raise funds in the money markets. The bank has not yet drawn on the emergency facility, Britain's finance minister, Alistair Darling, said on Sunday. Speculation that Northern Rock could be taken over has mounted as its problems raising cash amid a global credit market crunch have deepened in the last two months. Lloyds TSB ( LLOY.L ) held talks to mount a rescue of its rival, but a deal was ultimately blocked by the BoE and Financial Services Authority, several industry sources said. One industry source said a bidder was interested in a takeover but wanted the BoE to provide funding on a generous basis to help the deal go through, and that was not accepted as it would have been seen as an effective subsidy. The FSA would have wanted an open auction of such a distressed asset, other sources suggested. A BoE spokesman said it did not have jurisdiction to block a bid, which would be for the FSA and the Treasury. The FSA declined to comment. Other banks that have cast an eye on Northern Rock and who could participate in buying a slice of its mortgages include HSBC ( HSBA.L ), Barclays ( BARC.L ) and Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ), according to industry sources and media reports.
