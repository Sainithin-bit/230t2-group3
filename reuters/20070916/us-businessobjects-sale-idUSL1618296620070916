 PARIS  (Reuters) - Business Objects BOBJ.PA BOBJ.O, a French-American business intelligence software maker, is looking for a buyer and has appointed Goldman Sachs to find an investor, Le Figaro newspaper said. 

 At current market prices, Business Object is valued at 2.9 billion euros ($4.03 billion). Le Figaro said there were five interested parties, including business software maker SAP ( SAPG.DE ) of Germany. The paper did not name its source, and said neither Business Objects nor SAP would comment. Oracle ORCL.O and IBM ( IBM.N ) have in the past also been mentioned as possible bidders. The paper said a bid for Business Objects by a larger group would accelerate its growth amid consolidation in the sector.
