 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Workers at the Cessna corporate jet unit of Textron Inc ( TXT.N ) voted on Saturday to approve a new three-year contract, a union spokesman told Reuters. 

 The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers represents 5,800 manufacturing workers at Cessna's largest factory in Wichita, Kansas. The new contract calls for wage increases of 5 percent, 4 percent, and 4 percent over the three years, according to the union's Web site. The contract was approved by a "63 percent margin", said Bob Wood, a union spokesman. The union and the company agreed on a contract proposal early Thursday morning. "We are just excited the membership accepted our proposal," Doug Oliver, Cessna spokesman, told Reuters. "We can continue production and move forward." In addition to the wage increases, the contract includes a $3,000 lump sum bonus. Insurance premiums remain the same and there is an increase in the pension, according to the union's Web site. Demand for corporate jets has been strong recently, making the Cessna unit a key driver of Textron's profit growth. Cessna last year delivered 1,239 planes and reported revenue of $4.2 billion. Cessna, the world's largest maker of business jets, has about 10,000 workers in Wichita.
