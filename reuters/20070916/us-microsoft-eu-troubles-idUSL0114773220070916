 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Microsoft ( MSFT.O ) has 95 percent of the operating system market for the world's 1 billion computers and servers. It has paid $5.6 billion in fines and settlements so far in private and public antitrust actions, but avoided any major forced changes in its business practices: 

 -- U.S. courts found in 2000 and 2001 that it abused its monopoly. -- The European Commission, finding in 2004 that Microsoft abused its dominance, ordered a change in business practices. It fined the company 497 million euros ($685.4 million) then in 2006 imposed an extra penalty of 280.5 million euros for not complying. -- Microsoft has paid more than $4.5 billion to settle private cases. That includes $750 million to AOL-Time Warner in 2003, $2 billion to Sun Microsystems JAVA.O, $440 million to InterTrust Technologies, $536 million to Novell NOVL.O, $20 million to the Computer & Communications Industry Association in 2004 and $761 million to RealNetworks ( RNWK.O ) in 2005. -- The South Korean Fair Trade Commission fined Microsoft $32 million in 2005 for blocking competition and ordered it to separate its instant messaging system from Windows. -- Hungary raided a Microsoft subsidiary this year on suspicion of abusing its market power in dealing with software distributors.
