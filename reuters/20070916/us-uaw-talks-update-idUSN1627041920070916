 DETROIT  (Reuters) - UAW negotiators have said that they hope to achieve an "acceptable resolution" to ongoing contract talks with General Motors Corp on Sunday evening, a union local said in a recorded message for members. 

 UAW Local 1853, which represents workers at GM's Spring Hill, Tennessee, Saturn plant, said it had been informed by UAW Vice President Cal Rapson's office that "talks are continuing and they hope to achieve an acceptable resolution for our UAW membership sometime this evening." The UAW and GM have been in marathon bargaining talks since Thursday. The union's current contract with the No. 1 U.S. automaker expired on Friday.
