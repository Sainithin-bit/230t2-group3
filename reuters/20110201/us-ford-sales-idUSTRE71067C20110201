 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co's U.S. sales rose 13 percent in January, trailing expected gains in the industry after a sharp cut in sales to car rental agencies. 

 Ford said sold 127,317 cars and trucks in the month, which is typically one of the weakest of the year for auto sales. A year earlier, the No. 2 U.S. automaker had sold 112,406 cars and trucks. Ford said less-profitable sales to car rental agencies were down 27 percent from a year earlier. Retail sales to consumers were up 27 percent. (Reporting by  Kevin Krolicki , editing by Matthew Lewis)
