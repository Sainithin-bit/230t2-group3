 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Auto sales rose 17 percent in January, led by gains for General Motors Co and Chrysler as the two Detroit automakers restructured by the U.S. government took share from rivals. 

 The results come after major automakers outside the United States reported a strong start to 2011, soothing concerns about slower demand in growth-engine markets like India and a bumpy recovery in the developed markets of Europe. However, Toyota Motor Co, under pressure a year after a series of punishing recalls that tarnished its reputation, posted a disappointing U.S. sales gain that only kept pace with the market at 17 percent. That fell short of the sharp rebound some analysts had expected Toyota to show coming off its deep sales decline a year earlier. In response, Toyota said it would launch a new round of sales incentives and took steps to cut costs in its U.S. operations -- the kinds of desperate steps Toyota's U.S. rivals had been forced to take before last year's reversal of fortune for the Japanese automaker. Toyota said it would offer zero-percent and low-interest rate financing for some models backed by a new marketing campaign around the slogan "No. 1 For A Reason" through March. At the same time, the world's Toyota sent an unprecedented notice to managers at its U.S. sales headquarters in California on Tuesday offering buyouts to leave the payroll by April. Toyota was the only major automaker to have lost sales in the United States in 2010. Its buyout marked the first time it had moved to cut U.S. sales staff since it set up operations in that market in the late 1950s, a spokesman said. "Toyota's long-term outlook has been dimmed a bit," said IHS Automotive analyst Rebecca Lindland. "It's not glowing as brightly." DOUBLE-DIGIT GAINS GM, the No. 2 global automaker behind Toyota, posted a 22 percent sales gain powered by strong truck sales, pushing its market share above 20 percent. Chrysler, which is laying the groundwork for an initial public offering of stock in the second half of 2011, had a 23 percent sales gain. Other major automakers trailed with double-digit sales gains. Honda Motor Co and Nissan Motor Co were up 15 percent. Ford Motor Co gained 13 percent. GM's results marked the first time the top U.S. automaker had taken market share in six months and came along with a jump in sales of pickup trucks and SUVs, the heavy vehicles that remain the automaker's most profitable offerings. But GM's sales gain also came as it stepped up spending on incentives to lure consumers. The automaker vowed that it would not return to its much-criticized practice of buying market share with zero-percent financing and other discounts. In a departure from recent practice, however, GM declined to specify how much it had spent on sales incentives in January. "We're not going to return to the days of driving production with incentives. We know that's not going to be a recipe for success for us," GM's sales chief, Don Johnson, told reporters and analysts. Ford and GM, the two leading pickup truck makers, both reported sales for those work-related vehicles that outstripped gains for the market as a whole. Pickup trucks are often used by small-business owners, and analysts track that category of demand as a leading indicator for business investment. Sales for Ford's F-Series trucks jumped 30 percent. Sales for GM's Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra rose by a combined 29 percent. Analysts said that trend could be at risk if higher oil prices could crimp demand or send consumers scrambling toward the smaller vehicles that remain less profitable for automakers, especially the Detroit Three. "We're still not at the oil prices that would tilt the industry," said Nationwide chief economist Paul Ballew. "If oil prices don't trip us up, Detroit should have a pretty good year." Winter storms pummeled much of the United States in January. That included a particularly strong winter storm in the middle of January that caused six states to declare emergencies, shut interstate highways around Atlanta and dropped heavy snow in parts of Texas and the Carolinas. Nissan's U.S. sales chief, Al Castignetti, said the harsh weather had caused consumers to defer purchases, especially in the Northeast, typically a strong area of sales for Nissan. "We lost a lot of our ability to sell cars as a result of that," Castignetti said. Industry-wide U.S. sales rose 17 percent in January, according to Autodata Corp. On the adjusted and annualized basis tracked by analysts, the sales rate was 12.6 million vehicles, stronger than some analysts had expected after sales appeared to lose momentum in the final weeks of the month. The U.S. auto sales figures for January, one of the first snapshots of consumer demand, came as a survey found that the U.S. manufacturing sector grew at its fastest pace in nearly seven years during the month. OTHER MARKETS MIXED Outside the United States, other markets were mixed. French passenger car sales data showed a rise of 8 percent as the last effects of France's scrapping scheme boosted the figures. Spain, where incentives ran out in July, and a weak economic outlook and high unemployment are hurting spending power, was another dark spot, with sales down 24 percent. In Belgium, sales rose 7.8 percent. Italian auto orders were about 27 percent higher than the same month a year earlier. Meanwhile, Indian automakers reported sales rises of between 14 and 22 percent. Auto sales in India grew a record 31 percent in 2010 but a hike in interest rates, and rising fuel and vehicle costs are expected to slow sales growth this year.
