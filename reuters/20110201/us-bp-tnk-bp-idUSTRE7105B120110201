 LONDON  (Reuters) - BP Plc's ( BP.L ) oligarch partners in Russia's TNK-BP TNKBP.UL have won an injunction blocking BP's plan to enter a share swap and exploration deal with state-controlled Rosneft ( ROSN.MM ), one of the lawyers in the court told Reuters on Tuesday. AAR, the holding vehicle through which the oligarchs own half of TNK-BP, had argued that the tie-up breached an agreement between it and BP, that BP would seek AAR's approval before entering any major new ventures in Russia.
