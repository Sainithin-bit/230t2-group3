 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Four of Facebook's major underwriters -- Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Bank of America -- reduced their financial estimates for the soon-to-be-public company following the release of a revised prospectus on May 9 that noted the negative impact of mobile users on Facebook's business. 
 While Facebook did not provide any specifics in its amended S-1 filing, the four underwriters reduced their earnings and revenue estimates for both the second quarter of 2012 and the full year within the next two days, according to sources. The new estimates highlighted a continued slowdown in Facebook's growth, with the banks forecasting 30.4 percent year-on-year 2012 revenue growth on average, instead of the 36.7 percent growth previously expected. In 2011, Facebook's revenue grew 87.9 percent year-on-year to $3.71 billion. The new numbers were relayed to big investors through phone calls and conference calls, according to investors. Bank of America held a conference call on May 10 with analyst Justin Post, where the underwriter revealed the lowered estimates. Here are the detailed figures from the four banks, according to one of the investors who received the new numbers.
