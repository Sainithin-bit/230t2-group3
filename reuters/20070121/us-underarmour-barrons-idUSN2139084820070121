 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of Under Armor Inc. ( UA.N ) may be hot now, but the maker of trendy sweat-wicking sports clothing may be in for a cool-down, according to an article in the January 22 edition of Barron's. 

 Sales of the Baltimore-based company are believed to have reached $421 million in 2006, up from $5 million in 2000, and fans are touting Under Armor as the next Nike ( NKE.N ), the business weekly said. The company's stock closed Friday at $51.07 on the New York Stock Exchange, up from $25.85 in March. Under Armour's stock sells for more than 53 times the 96-cents-per-share earnings analysts project for this year, Barron's said. That puts its price-earnings ratio at 2.76 times the rate of earnings growth. Meanwhile, Nike, whose market value is 14 times Under Armour's, sells for 17 times this year's earnings and 1.16 times earnings growth, Barron's said. The stock began publicly trading in November 2005, Barron's said. Barron's said that there's a chance the stock is over-inflated. Shares should trade no higher than the low 40s, Barron's said, and if the company stumbles, shares could fall much further. "We believe the market's rich valuation of Under Armor is based on lofty revenue and profit-growth projections that will be difficult to sustain as the business matures," Barron's said, citing Morningstar analyst Brady Lemos. Already competitors, such as Nike and Adidas-Salomon, are moving into Under Armour's territory, Barron's said. The company doesn't have a patent on the fabric, so it relies chiefly on its brand name to defend itself from competitors, Barron's said. However, supporters say the company is just starting to tap growth opportunities with women and in overseas markets. "Don't be hung up on the price," shareholder Tom Forte of Geneva Investment Management of Chicago told Barron's. "Think about what the company can be. You have to believe in the company, and I do."
