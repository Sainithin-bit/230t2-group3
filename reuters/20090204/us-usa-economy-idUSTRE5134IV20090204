 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. economy is hemorrhaging jobs and may not stop bleeding for at least another year, even if the government acts quickly to stimulate the economy, according to reports released on Wednesday. 

 The U.S. private sector cut more than half a million jobs in January, ADP Employer Services said, and other data showed planned layoffs at U.S. firms reached their highest monthly level in seven years during the month. The reports come ahead of the government's more comprehensive non-farm payrolls data, which is due on Friday and expected to paint a similarly bleak picture. The service sector, which represents about 80 percent of U.S. economic activity, contracted at a less severe rate in January than the previous month, but the job outlook in this key area of the economy remained grim, according to the Institute for Supply Management. While the reports were slightly stronger than many economists expected, they said even the $900 billion economic stimulus bill being debated by lawmakers will only soften the pain of the downturn. "It's too late at this point to prevent a fairly significant further rise in the unemployment rate," said Joel Prakken, chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers, which jointly developed the ADP report. "And all that the stimulus can do is to limit how high the unemployment rate will go in this cycle," said Prakken, who was speaking to journalists during a teleconference. U.S. stocks extended their gains after the ISM data, which was not as weak as expected. Government bonds, which generally benefit from weak economic data, fell to session lows after the ISM report. As workers' fate appeared to grow less secure amid mounting job losses, U.S. President Barack Obama imposed tough new rules to rein in corporate pay. He capped executive compensation at $500,000 a year for companies receiving taxpayer funds and limited lavish severance packages paid to top officials. "DISAPPOINTING" The Institute for Supply Management said its non-manufacturing index came in at 42.9 in January compared with 40.1 in December. That was below the level of 50 that separates expansion from contraction. Economists had expected a reading of 39.0, according to the median of forecasts in a Reuters poll. "The services report is not too optimistic. It simply says the sector is declining at a slower rate," said Sung Won Sohn, professor of economics at California State University in Camarillo, California. "To me the key is really the employment report. We have to have at least three months of increases in non-farm payrolls to be able to say that we have the economy bottoming." Though the headline figure was not as bad as expected, the ISM's employment gauge reflected the job cuts throughout the economy, slipping to 34.4 from 34.5 in December. "With all the focus on employment, it's disappointing that the employment index did not recover at all in January," said Gary Thayer, senior economist at Wachovia Securities in St. Louis, Missouri. ADP Employer Services said that private employers cut 522,000 jobs in January versus a revised 659,000 jobs lost in December. The December job cuts were originally reported at 693,000. In its report on Friday, the Labor Department is expected to show 525,000 jobs were lost throughout the economy in January and the jobless rate is expected to rise to 7.5 percent. Prakken, at Macroeconomic Advisers, said he expected the unemployment rate to crest at more than 8 percent and "that would entail job losses of somewhere around 3 million" over the next 12 months. Last month, Prakken said he expected a little more than 2 million U.S. job losses over the next year. Economists had expected the ADP report to show 530,000 private-sector job cuts in January, according to the median of 27 forecasts in a Reuters poll, which ranged widely from a drop of 720,000 to losses of 495,000. The impact of an economic slump that is likely to be the most protracted since the 1930s Great Depression is broadening across a wide range of industries, outplacement company Challenger, Gray & Christmas said in its monthly report on U.S. job cuts. Job cuts announced in January totaled 241,749, up 45 percent from December's 166,348. Layoffs were up from 74,986 in the year-ago period. Record downsizing in the retail sector, with 53,968 layoffs planned, was the biggest area for job cuts and contributed to the overall rise in January's total, Challenger said. There was some good news for the housing market, the original source of the current U.S. economic troubles. U.S. mortgage applications rose in the last week of January, reflecting a jump in demand for home refinancing loans even as interest rates rose to their highest levels since early December, data from the Mortgage Bankers Association showed.
