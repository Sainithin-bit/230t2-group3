 (Reuters) - U.S. staffing companies reported fourth-quarter results well below Wall Street estimates, with the decline in demand for temporary staffing accelerating over the last three months as economic conditions worsened. 

 TrueBlue Inc ( TBI.N ) and The Corporate Executive Board Co EXBD.O also forecast results below market expectations, while Spherion Corp ( SFN.N ) refused to provide any, citing current economic headwinds. Tom Monahan, CEO of The Corporate Executive, said the ongoing economic situation had hurt the company's performance during the fourth quarter. "It is clear from our results that our progress on key operating priorities was not sufficient to offset sharp declines in contract value, either from a discrete number of large companies who experienced disruptive economic distress themselves, or from other companies that disappeared entirely," he said. However, with the U.S. Congress debating a nearly $900 billion economic stimulus package, including tens of billions of dollars for infrastructure projects to create jobs, the staffing companies may see a turnaround. BMO Capital Markets analyst Jeff Silber said the proposed stimulus plan from President Barack Obama could be of benefit to the staffing companies, particularly the light industrial staffing organizations. DISAPPONTING RESULTS Tacoma, Washington-based TrueBlue posted a net loss of $46 million, compared with net income of $14.4 million a year earlier. Excluding a goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge, the company posted earnings of 8 cents a share, below analysts' average estimate of 10 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue fell 15 percent to $302 million, below Wall Street's view of $320.9 million. TrueBlue also closed 70 branches during the year, bringing the total number of closures for 2008 to 102. Spherion Corp and Corporate Executive also posted weak quarterly results. "We believe trends worsened for most staffing providers throughout the fourth quarter, specifically those with permanent placement and European exposure, although it is likely no sector was spared," BMO Capital's Silber said. Corporate Executive shares were trading down 13 percent at $16.00 in after-market trade. Shares of TrueBlue closed at $9.24, while Spherion shares closed at $1.37 Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by Biswarup Gooptu in Bangalore; Editing by  Pratish Narayanan )
