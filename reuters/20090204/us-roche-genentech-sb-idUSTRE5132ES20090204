 BASEL, Switzerland  (Reuters) - Swiss drugmaker Roche ( ROG.VX ) is confident Genentech DNA.N shareholders will bite on its hostile $42 billion takeover bid, but is still not speaking directly to investors, executives said on Wednesday. 

 Chief Executive Severin Schwan said Roche Holding AG was not scooping up shares in the U.S. biotech group on the open market and would not meet investors until after it has officially filed its tender offer. "We are confident shareholders will consider this fair," Schwan told reporters after Roche unveiled disappointing full-year results. "We are not buying shares and we have no discussions on that point with the shareholders. Roche turned hostile last week in its $42 billion bid to buy the 44 percent of Genentech Inc it does not already own, cutting its offer and appealing directly to shareholders. Genentech investors appear cautious about the offer. Shares in the Californian group closed at $82.97 on Tuesday, below the new offer price of $86.50 per share. Schwan declined to give more details on the possible breakdown of financing of the deal, which Roche plans to fund from a combination of its own cash, bonds, commercial paper and bank financing. "Within two weeks we will provide the tender offer in writing," he said. "Only then I would I expect discussions with the shareholders." Roche had a cash pile of 16.7 billion Swiss francs ($14.6 billion) at the end of 2008 and remains confident it can raise the required funds for the deal when needed. "Over the last seven, eight years did you ever see that this management team did not achieve a major task which we had announced to you?" Chief Financial Officer Erich Hunziker said on a conference call. (Additional reporting by  Katie Reid  in Zurich; Editing by  David Holmes ) ($1=1.143 Swiss Franc)
