 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Time Warner Cable Inc posted a rise in fourth-quarter profit, excluding a writedown in the value of its cable systems. 

 The second-largest U.S. cable TV operator posted a net loss on Wednesday of $13.2 billion, or $8.36 per share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $327 million, or 33 cents a share. Time Warner Cable warned last month it would take a $15 billion writedown in the value of its cable franchise rights across the country in line with the falling value of media assets in the last year. Excluding the one-time charges, profit rose to 35 cents a share, compared with the analysts' average forecast of 32 cents, according to Reuters' Estimates. Revenue rose 8 percent to $4.4 billion as the company sold more phone and broadband services to customers. Time Warner Cable is 84 percent owned by Time Warner Inc, which is expected to completely separate the two companies through a split-off or spinoff transaction planned for completion by March 31.
