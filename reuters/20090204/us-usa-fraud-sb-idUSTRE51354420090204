 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Stephen Obie, the head of enforcement at the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, spoke to Reuters Boston Bureau Chief  Jason Szep  about the surfacing of Ponzi schemes as the U.S. economy weakens. 

 Leads to possible Ponzi schemes, he said, had doubled in the past year. In January alone, the CFTC filed three cases. The most prominent of these involved Nicholas Cosmo, a New York investment manager arrested on January 26 on suspicion of defrauding at least 1,500 investors of more than $370 million through his Long Island firm, Agape World Inc. Such schemes use money from new investors to pay distributions and redemptions to existing investors. They typically collapse when new funds dry up. Harry Markopolos, a former investment fund manager who repeatedly warned the Securities and Exchange Commission about Bernard Madoff's suspected $50 billion Ponzi scheme, described such schemes on Wednesday as a "cash-eating monster." REUTERS: How many Ponzi schemes do you expect this year? OBIE: We're expecting a 25 percent increase this year in the number of cases that we actually file. We've obviously gotten a good number of fresh leads. I think that's in part because a number of these schemes have been exposed with the economy. Investors are also being a little bit more cautious and worried about their money. I think it's very good for investors to be checking the consumer protection website at www.cftc.gov as well as the SEC's (Securities and Exchange Commission), and FINRA's (Financial Industry Regulatory Authority) and the NFA's (National Futures Association). The economy is such that the curtain is being revealed with the Great Oz and everybody is seeing now that there is no Great Oz. REUTERS: When did you set up your task force on Ponzi schemes and why is the CFTC taking this role? OBIE: Congress gave us increased authority in June of 2008 to go after foreign currency fraud. And as part of that legislation, we in-house determined that we wanted to set up a dedicated task force to combat foreign currency Ponzi schemes and fraud. REUTERS: Critics say these schemes show up a gap in regulatory oversight. Would you agree with that or do you see that as part of the challenge in investigating these cases? OBIE: The challenge in investigating these cases is that most of these miscreants are unregistered, operate below the radar and really create an illusion of profitability through deceit. They send out false statements; they try to befriend the investors all with one goal in mind: to get the investors' money. Once the investor has been swindled, the money typically disappears. So it's too late by the time the enforcement folks get involved. A lot of the research has to be placed at the front end by an investor. Lawyers call that due diligence. But I'm not sure everyone understands what that means. Basically what that means is exercise prudence before giving your money away. You lose all sorts of control once that money leaves your pocket. REUTERS: Do you see the Internet as an important tool in investigating these cases? With the Agape case, for example, there was chatter on the message board of one website suggesting it was a Ponzi scheme in November -- months before any charges were made. Do your investigations include looking at these kinds of websites? OBIE: Absolutely. The Internet can be a great sword for popping the balloon of a fraud. But it can also be a weapon that swindlers use because I have seen swindlers engage in sort of identity theft scheme. They will create a web site about their own firm, and then say they are registered with some fake government entity that sounds great. I can give you a personal example. The CFTC over the past couple of years has filed a couple of website identity thefts whereby a web site would be created and it would be just like one off of a legitimate name. What comes to mind is a website called something like the American Futures Exchange. The entity claimed they were regulated by the American Futures and Options Trading Commission -- AOFTC. They copied portions of our website, www.cftc.gov, and copied portions of legitimate exchanges like the NYMEX and others, and renamed the new entity. And it just turned out to be a fraudulent operation. That's an example of how while the Internet can be great at popping the balloon of these frauds, but you cannot rely purely on the Internet either. REUTERS: Earlier you said you expected a 25 percent rise in such schemes. Do you have any sense of what size these may be? OBIE: I am truly amazed about the size of the schemes we are seeing. These schemes have been running in the millions if not the tens of millions of dollars. And that is in part why they are so insidious -- because people are losing so much money that they thought they had. One way investors can protect themselves as well is not to put all their investment eggs in one basket. (Reporting by Jason Szep, editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
