 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc is not planning to pull out of its $400 million marketing deal with the New York Mets baseball team, a person familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. 

 The 20-year deal, which includes naming rights for a stadium in New York City known as Citi Field, attracted political scrutiny after Citigroup received more than $45 billion from the U.S. government in recent months to help shore up its balance sheet amid the global financial crisis. A report in the Wall Street Journal earlier on Tuesday said the bank was considering pulling out of its contract. But a person familiar with the matter said the bank was not planning to do so.
