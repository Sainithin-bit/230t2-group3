 LONDON  (Reuters) - Banco Santander's move to compensate some of its Madoff-hit clients and subsequent opposition by U.S. investors may lead to a bartering process as each seeks to avoid legal costs and get the best deal. 

 Other firms whose investors have been affected by the alleged $50 billion fraud by U.S. financier Bernard Madoff, have mostly declined to comment on whether they are mulling compensation offers. Last week Santander, which has 2.3 billion euros ($3 billion) of client exposure to Madoff, became the first bank to offer compensation to individual private banking clients. The plan involves issuing 1.38 billion euros in preferential shares to compensate initial investments, although this would not cover reported gains. Within days, clients who had filed a class action lawsuit against the bank asked a U.S. judge to scuttle the plan, saying it falls far short of a bigger potential payout and threatens to undermine the class action. Both moves could mark the start of a bargaining process involving further posturing until a 'price' is reached, as investors seek to extract the best deal and Santander looks to diffuse a class action as cheaply as possible. "(The U.S. court move) could be just a very clever PR exercise, create a hoo-ha, with the intent of Santander upping the offer," Neill Blundell, head of the financial crime unit at Eversheds LLP, told Reuters. "They could be saying 'it's an opening offer and we're not happy,'" he said. "It could lead to tactical bartering ... The higher Santander goes the more likely that people involved in the class action jump over the fence (and accept)." A class action works by gathering sufficient small investors to cover the huge legal costs involved. However, the more clients who accept Santander's offer -- thereby ruling themselves out of the class action -- the higher the costs for the remaining clients and therefore the greater the difficulty in pursuing the case. KEEPING QUIET There is so far little sign that other firms are willing to show their hand, instead watching the progress of other legal cases. Each firm's position will vary depending on whether or not they advised clients to invest with Madoff. David Greene, head of litigation at law firm Edwin Coe, told Reuters that Santander's offer was "heartening" but said no other firms had indicated they were willing to pay compensation. The firm is representing 20 to 25 clients, who are considering taking action against Barclays, HSBC, UBS, Bramdean and UBP. A dozen Paris law firms are planning to co-ordinate legal action against UBS over a Luxembourg-based fund hit by the alleged fraud. Firms such as UBP and Bramdean have declined to comment on the issue, although National Bank of Kuwait has returned $50 million to clients, the Financial Times reported. A spokeswoman for HSBC, which acted as custodian or provided financing to clients, said "we continue to defend ourselves vigorously."
