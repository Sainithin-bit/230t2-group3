 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. private sector job losses slowed slightly in January, according to a report by ADP Employer Services on  Wednesday that came in slightly below economists' expectations. 

 KEY POINTS: * ADP said private employers cut 522,000 jobs in January versus a revised 659,000 jobs lost in December. * The December job cuts were originally reported at 693,000. * Economists had expected 530,000 private sector job cuts in January, according to the median of 27 forecasts in a Reuters poll, which ranged widely from a drop of 720,000 to losses of 495,000. COMMENTS: WIN THIN, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST, BROWN BROTHERS HARRIMAN, NEW YORK: "The private jobs number was close to expectations and it may be showing some stability, but it's too early to say. We still have the non-farm payrolls report on Friday. I'm not surprised though that the euro is gaining from this report against the dollar because it wasn't worse than expected and it's playing to the whole risk-appetite theme. But I wouldn't put too much meaning into this report. Overall, aside from the  job losses, consumption all over the world is down. That's troubling. SCOTT BROWN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, RAYMOND JAMES & ASSOCIATES, ST PETERSBURG, FLORIDA: "The ADP data was no surprise and pretty close to what was expected. For non-farm payrolls I am looking for a fall of 525,000. Treasuries have not reacted much to these data and may put more weight on the ISM non-manufacturing report." KURT KARL, CHIEF U.S. ECONOMIST, SWISS RE, NEW YORK: "During this quarter, we should be slowing to the 400,000 range. We had such a shock in the fourth quarter. The economy was not doing well in January. "My call is closer for a 400,000 drop in the payrolls. This is a very serious drop in employment and it's going to hurt income growth and consumption. We won't be growing at least the second half of the year and even until 2010." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. equity index futures add to gains after ADP data. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices pare gains. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar holds gains versus euro.
