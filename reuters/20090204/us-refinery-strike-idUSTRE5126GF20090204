 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - About 30,000 unionized workers at U.S. refineries, chemical plants and pipelines reached a deal with industry on a new basic contract on Tuesday, averting a nationwide strike that could have boosted pump prices. 

 The United Steelworkers union and Shell Oil Co - representing U.S. refiners - agreed to a terms of a basic contract that sets minimum wages, benefits and working conditions at 86 energy facilities. The current contract was temporarily extended past its Sunday expiration so negotiations could continue. The union represents workers at 64 percent of U.S. refineries. "American drivers should be breathing a sigh of relief that contract talks between refinery workers and management have been settled, preventing a strike," said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Alaron Trading. U.S. gasoline futures rose last week on fears that a strike could shutter refineries and tighten up fuel supplies, which are currently plentiful amid weak profit margins for refiners. Hourly workers represented by the Steelworkers will get a 3 percent per year pay increase for each of the three years of the contract and pay 20 percent of their healthcare costs, according to sources familiar with the agreement. The average national wage for U.S. refinery workers is $30.06 an hour. While a nationwide strike has been averted, local negotiations still might lead to work stoppages at individual plants as workers and managers finish talks over site-specific contracts during the next several weeks. "The current contracts remain in force until the respective local unions conclude bargaining and ratify their new contracts," said Stan Mays, a spokesman for Shell, which led the talks on behalf of U.S. refiners. "We are optimistic agreements will be ratified at the local level in the near future." The union was unable to secure more stringent safety protections for refinery and chemical plant workers in light of the deadly 2005 explosion at BP Plc's Texas City, Texas, refinery that killed 15 workers. "These were tough negotiations given the economic conditions of an economy still in a total free-fall," said USW International President Leo Gerard said. "Oil companies were not willing to work with us fully to improve process safety." Shell said safety is a top industry concern. "We will always work closely with our employees to make Shell the safest workplace possible," Mays said. Top U.S. refiner Valero Energy Corp and BP Plc had pledged to idle some refineries in the event of a strike, while others like Shell and Exxon Mobil Corp planned to use replacement workers to keep churning out gasoline and other refined products. At least 10 percent of U.S. refining capacity of 17.6 million barrels would have been idled soon after a strike. The last nationwide strike by refinery workers was in 1980 and lasted about three months. (Additional reporting by  Gene Ramos  in New York; Editing by  David Gregorio )
