 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said on Wednesday he will reveal detailed plans for reinvigorating a slumping U.S. economy and getting credit flowing again. 

 "We will have to do more, substantially more, to fix this crisis," Geithner said at a press conference where President Barack Obama announced limits on the pay of corporate chiefs whose companies are receiving taxpayer-financed help. "Next week, we are going to outline a comprehensive program for financial recovery," Geithner said. "This program will be directed at supporting the flows of credit that are essential for our economy to begin growing again." (Reporting by  Glenn Somerville , Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
