 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Kraft Foods Inc KFT.N expects to start stemming declines in sales volume in the second quarter as retailers finish using up excess stock and it reaches the anniversary of 2008 price increases, its chief executive said on Wednesday. 

 "I expect to see continued progress during the course of the year, but beginning in the second quarter," CEO Irene Rosenfeld said of the company's prospects for improving volume, a measure of products shipped that excludes the impact of price and currency fluctuations. Kraft and other makers of food and consumer products saw volume, a closely watched indicator, hit in the fourth quarter as retailers tried to reduce inventory on store shelves amid the U.S. recession. Most of the inventory cuts in the United States are already done, Rosenfeld said in an interview. "We may start to see a little bit of it in Europe, which we had not seen yet," she said. Food and consumer products companies, which also raised prices in 2007 and 2008 to cope with then-soaring commodity costs, also have seen volume hurt as consumers traded down to lower-cost private-label products. Rosenfeld said she was comfortable with where Kraft's prices stood now and, in fact, said the company is cutting prices on nuts in order to regain marketshare. She said it also lowered cheese prices as dairy costs have fallen. Rosenfeld said that overall, the relation of Kraft's prices to those of competitors -- a key factor in maintaining market share -- is now where it should be. "I feel quite good about where we stand from a (price) gap standpoint," she said.
