 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc, the world's largest network equipment maker, reported stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings on Wednesday, sending its shares up 2 percent. 

 COMMENTARY MARK SUE, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL "The numbers look pretty good, all things considered in the tough environment. The EPS beat shows strong cost containment in an environment of reduced demand. Balance sheet metrics are also healthy with strong cash flow and strong receivable collections." On Cisco's comments about accelerating the alignment of resources: "Cisco may be articulating to investors that this downturn might be here for a while." "So far so good, all things considered." BARRY JARUZELSKI, PARTNER, BOOZ & CO "I would say it's not a big surprise. There was nothing really shocking. I don't think anybody was expecting them to defy gravity and be unaffected by the downdraft of investment and capital investment. This is still a very respectable performance." "The question I would have is: Have they been able to sustain margins? ... Clearly they have a very good operational history and very strong balance sheet. They're clearly going to be able to easily ride out however long this pain lasts and be at least as strong for it. I think the question is are they going to use this opportunity to do further acquisitions." On accelerating the alignment of resources: "That probably means we're going to make cutbacks and keep our overhead structure aligned with the size of business. And that means everything, probably including human resources." BROADPOINT AMTECH ANALYST MARK MCKECHNIE "The top line was a little better and the margins are in line. The balance sheet looked good -- good cash flow and inventories came down." "They're controlling their expenses in a challenging environment." "That's good management from Cisco and encouraging for some of their suppliers," he said, referring to the inventory decline. EHUD GELBLUM, ANALYST, JP MORGAN "The numbers are fine. They're right on. They beat by a penny, which they always seem to do ... Margins seem to be totally right there in line." "Putting this quarter aside, I think the economy's in for a long, bad cycle. ... Enterprise is 65 percent of Cisco's revenue; we're going to have continued layoffs and continued problems, so I think revenue's going to be a problem for these guys going forward." "But right now they seem to be holding on to their margins. This is not a growth story." (Reporting by  Sinead Carew  and  Robert MacMillan , compiled by Tiffany Wu)
