 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oil prices rose slightly on Tuesday on cold U.S. weather and expectations weekly data would show another fall in U.S. inventories. 

 U.S. crude for February delivery rose 10 cents to settle at $78.87 a barrel. In London, Brent crude for February traded up 32 cents to settle at $77.64 a barrel. U.S. heating oil futures led the oil complex higher, as cold weather hit the U.S. Northeast, the world's largest heating oil market. Temperatures were expected to average below normal in the region through Friday. "Cold weather and expectations for additional draws in crude and distillate stocks supported, while the stronger dollar and weak gasoline demand acted as a drag," said Tom Bentz, analyst at BNP Paribas Commodity Futures Inc in New York. An updated Reuters poll of analysts forecast weekly data will show U.S. crude inventories fell by 2 million barrels last week as refiners continued to draw down stocks for year-end tax reasons. Distillate stocks, including heating oil, were seen down by 2.2 million barrels on cold weather. Weekly U.S. inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute was due at 4:30 p.m. EST (2130 GMT) on Tuesday, while data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration will be released on Wednesday. Weekly U.S. gasoline demand data from MasterCard SpendingPulse showed consumption down 3.3 percent in the week to December 25, compared with the previous week, but up 1.3 percent against the previous year. Further support came after data showed U.S. consumer confidence improved more than expected in December, hitting a three-month high as job market pessimism eased and consumers' expectations reached a two-year high. Oil markets have looked to the wider economy this year for signs of strength that could bolster flagging fuel demand. Worries about the economy have at times prompted investors to pull cash from commodities. The U.S. dollar climbed against the euro and yen as the economy continued to show signs of improvement. U.S. home prices were unchanged in October, according to the Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller indexes, indicating stabilization in the housing sector, though the figures dashed hopes for a sixth-straight monthly increase. Crude rose on Monday, boosted by colder U.S. weather and tensions between Russian and Ukraine that raised concerns about oil supplies to Europe. However, Ukrainian state energy firm Naftogaz said on Tuesday that Russia had agreed to a 30 percent increase in the transit tariff for the oil it transports to Europe in a deal that calmed fears of supply cuts.
