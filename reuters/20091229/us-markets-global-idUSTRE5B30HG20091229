 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The dollar gained against most major currencies on Tuesday on continued signs of a better U.S. economy, while oil prices rose slightly on cold U.S. weather and expectations of a further decline in U.S. inventories. 

 But U.S. stocks slipped in a low-volume session even after data showed a rise in consumer confidence. A housing report failed to back up that optimism and kept the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq from posting a seventh straight day of gains. "It's good to see confidence higher than expected, but you'll need improvement in home prices if you want to see the financial and broader market improve over the next six to 12 months," said Chad Morganlander, portfolio manager at Stifel, Nicolaus & Co in Florham Park, New Jersey. Earlier in Europe, regional shares notched a new closing high for 2009 and Asian stocks rose on growing investor optimism about the global economic recovery. Traders and analysts warned against drawing too many conclusions from price fluctuations this week, noting that a few large trades can alter a market's direction. Trading volume on Wall Street was the lowest for the year, according to Birinyi Associates. The day's decline came after six days of gains, with the benchmark Standard & Poor's index up 25 percent for the year. The Dow Jones industrial average dipped 1.67 points, or 0.02 percent, to close at 10,545.41. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index fell 1.58 points, or 0.14 percent, to 1,126.20. The Nasdaq Composite Index slipped 2.68 points, or 0.12 percent, to end at 2,288.40. U.S. Treasury debt prices rose following a decently attended $42 billion auction of five-year notes and upbeat consumer confidence data. The Treasury Department plans to issue a total of $118 billion in new debt. "Given the amount of supply we have to bid on, the market is putting in a good performance," said Mary Ann Hurley, vice president of fixed-income trading at D.A. Davidson & Co in Seattle. OIL AND BONDS UP, GOLD TUMBLES U.S. heating oil futures led energy prices higher as cold weather hit the U.S. Northeast, the world's largest heating oil market. Temperatures were expected to average below normal in the region through Friday. "Cold weather and expectations for additional draws in crude and distillate stocks supported, while the stronger dollar and weak gasoline demand acted as a drag," said Tom Bentz, analyst at BNP Paribas Commodity Futures Inc in New York. An updated Reuters poll of analysts forecast weekly data will show U.S. crude inventories fell by 2 million barrels last week as refiners drew down stocks for year-end tax reasons. Year-end buying from asset managers and a rise in U.S. consumer confidence in December to a three-month high bolstered the dollar. "We had a decent consumer confidence report and that helped the dollar. For about a month now, we've had this dynamic where good economic news is starting to support the dollar," said Boris Schlossberg, director of currency research at GFT in New York. U.S. crude for February delivery rose 10 cents to settle at $78.87 a barrel. In London, Brent crude for February gained 32 cents to settle at $77.64 a barrel. U.S. Treasury debt prices advanced. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was up 11/32 in price to yield 3.81 percent. The 2-year U.S. Treasury note was up 1/32 in price to yield 1.10 percent. Gold dropped, snapping a three-session winning streak, as a resurgent dollar dampened bullion's appeal as a hedge against paper currency depreciation. U.S. gold futures for February delivery slid $9.80 to settle at $1,098.10 an ounce in New York. The dollar was up against a basket of major currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index up 0.26 percent at 77.833. The euro was down 0.25 percent at $1.4346. Against the yen, the dollar was up 0.47 percent at 92.02. The Reuters-Jefferies CRB index at one point hit 285.37, its highest level since mid-October 2008, after tracking a steady rise in crude oil prices. But the index later fell, ending the session down 0.3 percent at 283.73. NIKKEI AT 4-MO. HIGH ON RECORD DATE Japan's Nikkei average edged higher to finish at 10,638.06, its highest close in four months, lifted partly by gains in oil and metals prices. Tuesday marked the 20th anniversary of the Nikkei reaching a record high of 38,915.87, which was the peak of Japan's bubble in asset prices. The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan rose just over 0.6 percent in thin trade.
