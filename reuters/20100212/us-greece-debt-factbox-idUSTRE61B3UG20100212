 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Even if EU leaders put some flesh on the bones of their vague promises to support Athens next week, Greece still some 20 billion euros of bonds and T-bills maturing in April and May. 

 GREEK DEBT PROFILE -- Total borrowing need in 2010 is 53.2 billion euros or 21.8 percent of GDP. This is down by 13 billion from 2009 and includes 12.95 billion in interest payments, a primary deficit of 10 billion euros and redemptions of 30.23 billion. -- Weighted average maturity profile of Greek debt is 7.8 years, the second-highest in the euro zone after Austria. -- The average financial duration of Greek debt is 4.2 years. -- Rollover risk in 2010 (defined as redemptions as a percent of total outstanding debt) is less than 10 percent. -- The refinancing ratio of Greek debt in the next 5 years is lower than 55 percent. -- Expected privatization proceeds of about 2.3 percent of GDP in the next 3 years will be used to retire debt. -- Repayment of 3.8 billion euros of capital injections to Greek banks under a government liquidity support scheme will also be used to reduce debt. -- Greek government bonds make up 82.6 percent of total outstanding debt with T-bills accounting for just 3.1 percent. The remainder is syndicated loans. Only 0.4 percent of Greek debt is in foreign currency -- Swiss francs, U.S. dollars, yen, sterling. 2010 REFUNDING HURDLES -- April 20 (8.2 bln euros of 5-year, 3.1 percent bonds mature) -- May 19 (8.5 bln euros of 10-year, 6 percent bonds come due) Source: finance ministry (Reporting by George Georgiopoulos; Editing by  Andy Bruce )
