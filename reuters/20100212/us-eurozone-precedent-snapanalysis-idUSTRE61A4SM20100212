 PARIS  (Reuters) - European Union leaders may have hoped that by declaring full political support for Greece's efforts to overcome its debt crisis, they could avoid putting their hands in their wallets. 

 The initial financial market reaction when an EU summit ended on Thursday without any concrete financial support measures suggests they were wrong. The euro slid on foreign exchanges, losing nearly 2 cents against the dollar at one stage. Greece's borrowing costs spiked and the cost of insuring Greek debt against default jumped after the leaders brushed aside any specifics of a possible bailout. "Your question about pledges in fact was not raised because the Greek government hasn't requested any financial support ... That is why we shouldn't speculate about scenarios that so far haven't happened," European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said. The leaders said in a joint statement that "euro area member states will take determined and coordinated action, if needed, to safeguard financial stability in the euro area as a whole." But Chancellor Angela Merkel made clear she did not believe it was needed now, comparing the situation with the way Germany handled a crisis of confidence in savings banks in 2008. "We didn't give any money to any specific bank. We gave a guarantee to citizens and that did the trick without having to give any money to any bank," she told a news conference. Markets were supposed to be impressed both by Prime Minister George Papandreou's pledge of further measures to ensure Greece meets its tough deficit cutting targets, and by the prospect of unprecedented, intrusive supervision by the European Commission and the European Central Bank. But expectations had been higher after euro zone finance ministers and ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet discussed the possibility of bilateral loans to Athens, guarantees of Greek debt or indirect bond purchases via state-owned banks in talks on Wednesday, according to EU officials. IMPLICATIONS BEYOND GREECE Clearly, there is more to the EU's position than was announced at the summit. Euro zone finance ministers will discuss Greece again at their regular meeting on Monday and no EU leader has ruled out a financial rescue or declared it illegal. But the leaders' failure to say anything about such possible steps seems unlikely to calm feverish markets. Merkel may need time to persuade German taxpayers, including her own liberal FDP coalition partners, that it is in their interest to bail out a fiscally incontinent partner which faked its economic statistics to get into the euro zone. EU diplomats say that in any bailout euro zone states would likely contribute voluntarily based on their economic weight. Europe's biggest economy would thus become its lender of last resort, setting a precedent that few Germans will relish, even if Berlin gains greater sway over its partners' budget policies. The issue has implications well beyond Greece since it could apply in future to Portugal, Spain, Ireland or other high-debt or high-deficit euro zone countries. "This is not the way the euro was sold to the Germans," wrote commentator Holger Steltzner in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. "Before the deutschemark was abandoned, the Maastricht Treaty was solemnly signed, expressly forbidding a member of the monetary union from underwriting another member's debts." But if Thursday's "jawboning" exercise doesn't work, Germany may have little choice since the stability of the euro is a vital national interest and the euro zone is Germany's biggest export market.
