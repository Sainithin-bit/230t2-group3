 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Army cleared Oshkosh Corp on Friday to resume work on a $3 billion medium truck contract, an Army document showed, after BAE Systems Plc and Navistar International Corp filed successful protests against the award. 

 Congress's Government Accountability Office upheld parts of the two protests in December, telling the Army to reevaluate all three bids. The Army said in a statement it decided to proceed with the Oshkosh contract after reviewing all three bids and reevaluating Navistar's past performance. It said the decision had been affirmed by a peer review run by the Pentagon. The five-year contract, which runs through September 30, 2014, covers production of over 23,000 vehicles, including production of up to 12,415 trucks, 10,926 trailers, and associated support and engineering services. The total estimated contract value at award is $3.023 billion. Defense consultant Jim McAleese said the decision was in line with expectations and would result in savings for the Army of over $1 billion.
