 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Finance Minister Jun Azumi said on Tuesday he would not rule out Japan sharing some of the burden related to a bailout scheme for Greece, provided that Europe mapped out a rational plan. 

 Azumi told reporters after a cabinet meeting that the first requirement was that each country must make efforts to implement what was agreed at a European summit meeting on July 21. He also said he expects Japan's third budget for the current fiscal year, which is to help fund reconstruction from the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, to exceed 11 trillion yen ($144 billion).
