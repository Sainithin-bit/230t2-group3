 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve Bank agreed at its last meeting April 26-27 to complete a $600 billion bond buying program on schedule at the end of June. After that meeting Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said the central bank is in no hurry to withdraw its support for the recovery, with unemployment high and inflation relatively low. 

 Below are some of the tools the Fed has at its disposal for eventually tightening monetary policy. RAISING THE FED FUNDS TARGET RATE The Fed's traditional policy lever targets the effective federal funds rate -- the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight loans. But with banks sitting on more than $1 trillion in excess reserves - an effect of the Fed's unprecedented policy of monetary easing through asset purchases - economists believe this tool will be ineffective without raising the interest paid on those reserves (see next item). RAISING THE INTEREST PAID ON EXCESS RESERVES The interest rate the Fed pays on excess reserves will be the one to watch once the Fed begins to raise borrowing costs. By raising the rate it pays on bank reserves, the Fed creates a magnet for banks to keep those reserves with the Fed rather than lend them out. A number of central banks around the world have effectively used similar tools. LARGE-SCALE REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS The Fed could arrange large-scale reverse repurchase agreements (reverse repos), with financial market participants. This would temporarily drain reserves from the banking system and reduce excess liquidity at other institutions. The goal would be to tighten the linkage between interest on reserves and other short-term market interest rates. The Fed has been testing reverse repos in small batches, and in January added 32 new money market funds to its roster of counterparties it could eventually tap for reverse repo operations. In a reverse repo, the New York Fed sells securities from its portfolio with an agreement to buy them back at a slightly higher price at a later date. TERM DEPOSIT FACILITY The Fed began testing its new term deposit facility for banks last June, using small-scale auctions to offer term deposits for banks that are akin to the certificates of deposit banks offer retail customers. Like the reverse repos, the auctions reduce the supply of funds banks have available to lend to each other. While the Fed already pays interest on reserves held overnight, a term deposit facility would lock up funds for longer. Recent tests have been for 28-day terms. ADJUST ITS REINVESTMENT POLICY The Fed could shift its approach to repayments of principal on the Treasury securities it holds to gradually normalize its balance sheet, reinvesting the proceeds from maturing longer-term Treasury securities to shorter-term issues. This would reduce the average maturity of the Treasury holdings toward pre-crisis levels, while leaving the overall value of the holdings unchanged. It could also stop a policy, begun last August, of reinvesting proceeds from maturing mortgage-backed securities into Treasuries. The result would be "passive tightening" as the Fed's balance sheet shrinks. ASSET SALES The Fed could sell a portion of its securities holdings into the open market. Members of the policy-setting committee agree that sales of agency-related securities should eventually be used to normalize the Fed's holdings. The sales would be communicated well in advance and be conducted gradually. DISCOUNT RATE INCREASE The Fed last February raised the discount rate -- the rate it charges banks for emergency loans -- to 0.75 percent from 0.5 percent, saying the move reflected healing financial markets and was not a step to tighten lending conditions. Two Federal Reserve Banks, Kansas City and Dallas, have repeatedly called for a further increase to return the Fed's surcharge for emergency loans to pre-crisis levels. The Fed board, which acts on discount rate requests, has declined to back the proposals. (For more stories on Fed policy go to <FED/AHEAD>) (Reporting by Reuters Fed team; Editing by Andrew Hay)
