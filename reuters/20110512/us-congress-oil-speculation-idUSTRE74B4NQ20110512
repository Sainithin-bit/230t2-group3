 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The head of Exxon Mobil ( XOM.N ) stopped short of blaming speculators for the run-up in oil prices, but he told Congress on Thursday that based only on the fundamentals of supply and demand, the price of oil should be in the range of $60 to $70 a barrel. 

 "When we look at it, it's going to be somewhere in the $60 to $70 range if you said: 'If I had access to the next marketable barrel, what would it cost?" Exxon's CEO and Chairman Rex Tillerson told the Senate Finance Committee in response to a question about the influence of speculators on high oil prices. (Reporting by  Tom Doggett )
