 LONDON  (Reuters) - Takeda Pharmaceutical Co, Japan's largest drugmaker, is in talks to buy Nycomed, a private equity-owned Swiss rival, for more than $12 billion, sources with direct knowledge of the matter say. 

 Any deal would be Japan's second-biggest overseas takeover and would extend Takeda's reach in emerging markets. Here is a short history of Nycomed: 1874 - Norwegian pharmacist Morten Nyegaard starts importing pharmaceutical products. He later establishes Nyegaard & Co, which becomes known as NYCO and nearly a century later, changes its name to Nycomed 1913 - Company starts producing its own pharmaceutical products; 12 years later it begins conducting its own research 1974 - Company introduces Amipaque, a contrast agent that helps make X-rays safer 1997 - Nycomed merges with medical imaging and biotech group Amersham -- the first company sold off in a wave of privatizations by British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s. The $1.34 billion deal creates a world leader in diagnostics. 1999 - Nycomed Amersham sells a 70 percent stake in its pharmaceutical business, Nycomed Pharma, to Swedish private equity firm Nordic Capital for $548 million. 2002 - Nordic buys the final 30 percent and then sells Nycomed to a consortium led by rival private equity firms DLJ Merchant Banking and Blackstone, in a $1.23 billion deal 2005 - Nordic buys back a 51 percent stake in Nycomed for $1.14 billion 2006 - Nycomed buys the pharmaceutical arm of Altana AG, then one of Europe's last chemical-drug hybrids, for $5.73 billion, giving it a big boost in products and regions covered. It then switches headquarters from Denmark to Zurich, Switzerland. 2009 - Nycomed mounts a bid for the drugs arm of Belgian chemicals firm Solvay, but loses to Abbott Laboratories 2010 - Nycomed's key lung drug, Daxas, wins approval in Europe. It wins U.S. FDA approval in March 2011. Sources: Nycomed websites, Thomson Reuters data, Reuters research (Reporting by  Quentin Webb ; editing by David Cowell)
