 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - ECB policymaker Juergen Stark left little doubt on Thursday more euro zone rate hikes were on the agenda, even as the International Monetary Fund urged the bank to tread carefully to help contain the region's debt woes. 

 Warning the fiscal crisis could yet spread to core nations in the single currency bloc, the IMF called in its latest report on Europe for broad-based action and "unrelenting" reform efforts from periphery states. It said it was ready to give Greece more aid if the country needed it and urged the ECB to play its part by taking a cautious approach to interest rate increases, adding the tactic of providing limit-free liquidity to euro zone banks might need to be prolonged. The fund's European Department Director, Antonio Borges, said that while interest rates needed to rise to more normal levels -- thereby raising sovereign debt servicing costs -- the ECB would have to manage the process with care. "We need to keep in mind that the recovery in the euro area is under way, but it is not extraordinarily strong or dangerously strong, so there is no reason from that perspective to start tightening (monetary policy) sharply." LOOKING PAST THE CRISIS? The ECB raised euro zone borrowing costs to 1.25 percent last month, bringing to an end almost two years of record low rates. With inflation at the highest since the financial crisis sent the economy into a tailspin in late 2008, financial markets expect the bank to look past the debt crisis and raise interest rates again to 1.5 percent in July and a third time before the end of the year. Stark, who heads the ECB's influential economics division, bolstered that belief on Thursday. "I think it is a necessity to withdraw - to continue to withdraw - monetary accommodation in order to retain inflation expectations well anchored and to keep inflation under control," he said in an interview with the Financial Times. Stark's fears about inflation underscored concerns voiced on Wednesday by two other ECBers -- Belgium's Luc Coene and Italian executive board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi -- and were supported by the ECB's latest survey of professional economic forecasters, which showed a sharp jump in near-term expectations. Consensus forecasts for this year jumped to 2.5 percent, well over the ECB's target of just under 2 percent and a significant increase on the last survey's figure of 1.9 percent. However, inflation was seen roughly in line with target next year and over the longer term, at 1.9 and 2.0 percent respectively. "You have a much more substantial increase this year than next year so this confirms what the ECB has been saying that this is a hump in inflation," said Deutsche Bank economist Mark Wall. "That takes some of the pressure off them in terms of the speed they will hike rates. We still expect them to hike rates in July but it reduces the risk of an unscripted rise in June," he added. A new Reuters poll also showed euro zone inflation was unlikely to subside much before the end of the year, and this year's first quarter could be as good as it gets for economic growth until at least 2013. Inflation worries are not confined to the euro zone. On Wednesday, the Bank of England predicted higher inflation despite a slower-than-expected recovery, paving the way for a possible rise before the end of the year. GREEK UNCERTAINTY ECB members continued to warn against the consequences of a Greek debt restructuring, something financial markets are increasingly factoring in due to the scale of the country's borrowings and the toll its austerity program is taking on its economy. "Far from being a convenient means of minimizing economic losses and dissipating uncertainty, a default would have extreme adverse consequences, many of an irreversible nature, for the Greek economy," ECB board member Jose Manuel Gonzalez Paramo said in a speech in Madrid. The IMF said "unrelenting" reform efforts from Greece and other euro zone periphery states were the first line of defense against contagion, which remained "a tangible downside risk." The Washington-based fund's views about Greece are being closely watched ahead of next month's all-important decision on whether Athens receives the next 12 billion euro tranche of its EU/IMF bailout. Director Borges, said the fund stood ready to provide Greece with more aid if Athens requested it, though no talks were currently taking place.
