 (Reuters) - Japan's largest drugmaker Takeda Pharmaceutical Co ( 4502.T ) is in talks to buy Swiss rival Nycomed in a deal that could be valued at about $14.2 billion, Bloomberg said, citing two people with knowledge of the matter. 

 Negotiations are at an advanced stage and a deal could be announced as early as next week, Bloomberg reported. No agreement has been reached yet and the talks could still fall apart, the news agency said. Privately held Nycomed, which is controlled by Nordic Capital and Credit Suisse Group AG's private-equity unit, would help broaden Takeda's reach in emerging markets, the report said.
