 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Kohl's Corp ( KSS.N ) raised its full-year profit forecast, saying exclusive merchandise such as an upcoming line of Jennifer Lopez clothing and pent-up demand will boost the retailer's sales. 

 Shoppers also are proving receptive to Kohl's initial price increases, Chief Executive Kevin Mansell said on Thursday on a conference call, echoing comments on Wednesday from rival department store operator Macy's Inc ( M.N ). Kohl's and Macy's results and forecasts reflect the middle-class consumer's willingness to spend again, even in the face of rising gas and clothing prices. U.S. retail sales rose for the 12th straight month in April, the Commerce Department reported on Thursday. Kohl's has raised the prices on some denim items by a high-single digit percentage, leading to fewer items being sold but not so much of a decline as to bring down total sales, Mansell said. But Mansell cautioned analysts that the bulk of price increases were still to come in the fall, and said he still expects price inflation of between 10 and 15 percent. Kohl's expects same-store sales to be up between 2 and 4 percent this quarter, Mansell said. Kohl's first-quarter profit rose 6 percent to $211 million, or 73 cents a share, from $199 million, or 65 cents, a year earlier. That was in line with Wall Street estimates. Sales were up 3.1 percent at $4.16 billion. As previously reported, sales at stores open at least a year rose 1.3 percent during the quarter, which ended on April 30, below the pace of Macy's and J.C. Penney Co Inc ( JCP.N ). Kohl's, which operates nearly 1,100 department stores, raised its full-year earnings per share forecast to $4.25-$4.40. Analysts on average expect $4.36, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The previous Kohl's forecast was $4.05 to $4.25. The company said some of the increase stems from planned share repurchases during the current quarter. Kohl's shares were up 54 cents, or 1 percent to $54.15 in morning trading. J.LO TO HELP OUT Kohl's, which caters to a more price-sensitive shopper than Macy's, posted some of the strongest same-store sales gains among department stores in 2010. Exclusives, which include a line with fashion designer Vera Wang and another with singer Britney Spears, had a lot to do with that and now account for half of Kohl's sales, which Mansell told Reuters was an all-time high. "Shoppers really are looking for a reason to shop (at) Kohl's, and not Macy's, Penney or the Gap, and exclusive brands provide that," Mansell told Reuters. But also importantly, he said, online shopping will make it easier to comparison shop and erode retailers' pricing power for items that are widely available. One investor said those efforts, including a line of clothing by "American Idol" judge, actress and singer Jennifer Lopez coming this fall, will help the chain later this year. "Kohl's is in a good position because of new brands hitting in the fall," said Walter Stackow, an analyst with Manning & Napier, which owns Kohl's shares. Merchandise inventory rose 5.8 percent, in line with sales gains. The figures mirror efforts by Macy's not to build up too much inventory in case shoppers pull back, forcing retailers to slash prices on goods they can't sell. Tight inventory will mitigate the damage from rising cotton prices, Stackow said. (Reporting by Phil Wahba; Editing by  Derek Caney , John Wallace and  Robert MacMillan )
