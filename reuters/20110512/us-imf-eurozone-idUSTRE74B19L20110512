 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Euro zone periphery members need "unrelenting" reform efforts to prevent the debt crisis spreading, the IMF said on Thursday, and urged the European Central Bank to hold off from hiking interest rates. 

 In its twice yearly Regional Economic Outlook for Europe, the International Monetary Fund warned the stakes were high in the ongoing euro zone debt crisis and called for aggressive and comprehensive policy action to deal with the woes. "Unrelenting reform efforts at the national level of the crisis-afflicted countries need to be the first line of defense," the IMF report said. "Contagion to the core euro area, and then onward to emerging Europe, remains a tangible downside risk." The Washington-based fund's views about Greece are being closely watched ahead of next month's all-important decision on whether Athens receives the next 12 billion euro tranche of its EU/IMF bailout. Ireland and Greece are already dependent on 52.5 billion euros of IMF aid while Portugal is awaiting a 26 billion euros three-year lifeline from the Fund. Banks in the troubled countries are also being kept alive by unlimited ECB liquidity. The report, presented by IMF Director of the European Department Antonio Borges, urged European leaders finalize an increase in the firepower of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), and its 2013 replacement, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). "Commitments have been made to improving lending capacity and pricing under the EFSF. Making those commitments operational by filling in the still-missing specifics is now essential," the IMF said. The IMF also argued that the European Central Bank could hold off from aggressively hiking euro zone interest rates. The Frankfurt-based central bank raised them for the first time in almost three years last month and economists currently see two further hikes before the end of the year. "Monetary policy in the euro area can afford to remain relatively accommodative, though normalization lies ahead as economic slack gradually dissipates," the report said. LIQUIDITY SUPPORT It also said the ongoing troubles in the euro zone may require the ECB to prolong its crisis tactic of providing limit-free liquidity to the region's banks. Greek, Irish banks in other high-debt member states remain heavily reliant on the ECB's funding lifelines with access to normal bank-to-bank lending markets currently impossible due to bankruptcy fears. "The ECB may need to extend further in time its regime of full-allotment refinancing for some of its liquidity operations (past June 12)," the report said. Debt-burdened periphery members were stuck in a downward spiral, the IMF warned, where ratings downgrades for sovereign balance sheets trigger fears of deteriorating creditworthiness in its banking sector that holds significant amounts of domestic government debt. Bonds maturing this year issued either by sovereigns or banks combine to account for 10 percent of economic output or more in Greece, Portugal and Spain, it added. "Public debt sustainability is vital to breaking negative feedback loops between sovereign and banking sector instability. Countries under market pressure have appropriately front-loaded their fiscal adjustments, which they now must see through." Removing the last barriers to cross-border banking mergers could help solve funding deadlocks and help restore confidence in a viable banks, which the IMF argued remains an "absolute must" to end the current crisis. "Stepping back from financial integration would be wrong," it said. "To prevent new crises (...) more rather than less financial and economic integration is needed." Moreover, while the UK, Ireland and Spain have already begun plans to cure their ailing banks, many other countries still have yet to demonstrate their commitment to putting their banking sectors on a stronger footing. The IMF's European director nonetheless said the overall outlook remains quite bullish thanks to remarkable export strength in core countries like Germany. "The main message of the outlook is one of quiet confidence. Europe is doing well overall," Borges said. (Editing by Toby Chopra)
