 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Allstate Corp ( ALL.N ), the largest publicly traded U.S. home and auto insurer, said it lost $1.4 billion as a result of a devastating series of tornadoes in April and would now make a regular practice of releasing such figures. 

 Allstate's disaster losses so far this year are rapidly approaching its total for 2010. Barclays Capital cut its 2011 estimate for operating earnings per share by nearly half, saying the loss reported on Thursday was much worse than anticipated. Allstate shares were down 0.5 percent at $32.87 in afternoon trade, well off their earlier lows but still enough to be the second-largest decliner among S&P insurance shares. The new policy is likely to comfort analysts, who pressured the company earlier this year for more disclosure on its exposure to disasters. At that time, Allstate executives said it was difficult to come up with a way to report such losses. The company said it would now provide monthly and quarter-to-date updates any time a monthly loss exceeded $150 million. Over the last 10 years, Allstate said, monthly losses have crossed that threshold about 30 percent of the time. While it is common for insurers, and especially reinsurers, to disclose catastrophe exposure after major events, it is unusual for an insurer of any kind to commit to monthly loss updates. The April loss is roughly equal to Allstate's total catastrophe losses for the full second quarters of 2010 and 2009 combined. With the worst part of tornado season yet to begin, the losses could rise. Allstate said it had experienced 13 loss events in April in the United States and Canada, with the worst being a tornado outbreak in the U.S. South in the last week of the month. More than 100,000 claims have been filed so far, it said. Barclays cut its 2011 operating earnings per share estimate to $1.90 from $3.40, while keeping an "equal weight" rating on the stock.
