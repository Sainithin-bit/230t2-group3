 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Wachovia Corp WB.N is being 
investigated by federal prosecutors as part of a probe into 
alleged laundering of drug proceeds by Mexican and Colombian 
money-transfer companies, according to a report in the Wall 
Street Journal on Saturday. 

  An official of Charlotte, North Carolina-based Wachovia, 
the country's fourth largest banking firm, said the company is 
cooperating with the probe, the newspaper said. The Journal 
attributed its information about the probe to "people familiar 
with the matter."  A Wachovia spokeswoman did not immediately return a call 
seeking comment.  Wachovia is one of several large banks being investigated 
for relationships with the money-transfer companies, the 
Journal said.  Regulators said on Friday that Wachovia has agreed to pay 
as much as $144 million to settle allegations it failed to help 
consumers who fell prey to schemes operated by telemarketers 
that maintained accounts at the bank.  Wachovia this month posted a surprise first-quarter loss as 
credit problems from mortgages and other debt soared.  (Reporting by Kyle Peterson, editing by Patricia Zengerle)
