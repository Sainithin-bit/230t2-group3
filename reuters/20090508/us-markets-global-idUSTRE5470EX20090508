 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Global stocks and crude oil rose on Friday after U.S. jobs data and the long-awaited stress tests on U.S. banks were better than expected, adding to growing optimism that a slumping U.S. economy is improving. 

 The surge in equity markets pushed major indexes further into positive territory for the year, with MSCI's all-country index .MIWD00000PUS now up 6.4 percent so far in 2009. The dollar slipped against the yen and the euro, which surged to a six-week high above $1.36 as the news from the labor market dried up safe-haven flows into the U.S. currency. Oil rose more than 3 percent to settle above $58 a barrel, close to a six-month high, after data showed U.S. employers cut 539,000 jobs in April -- below the March tally of 663,000 job losses and consensus expectations of 590,000. "Crude futures are higher because people think the sky is no longer falling," said Mark Waggoner, president of Excel Futures in Huntington Beach, California. "From the middle of the week we've seen positive numbers on jobs -- private sector jobs, jobless benefit claims and now smaller than expected job losses last month," he said. U.S. and European stocks rose as financials gained after the results of bank stress tests were widely seen as not as bad as expected. Equity markets were helped by energy shares that rose on the back of stronger crude prices. Several large U.S. banks announced equity and debt offerings to raise their capital levels after the stress test results were released late Thursday. The results have "given people a little bit of confidence that the government can help to solve this part of the financial crisis," said Richard Sparks, senior equities analyst and options trader at Schaeffer's Investment Research in Cincinnati. "There's a sense that the government actually has a logical plan, (that they) are holding the companies to a certain standard (so) even if things got worse, these companies will be able to survive. That helps bolster confidence in the administration." Shares of major banks rose, with JPMorgan Chase Inc ( JPM.N ) and Wells Fargo & Co each rising more than 10 percent. Citigroup Inc ( C.N ) rose 5.5 percent and Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) 4.9 percent. The KBW Bank index .BKX jumped 12.1 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  gained 164.80 points, or 1.96 percent, to close unofficially at 8,574.65. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  added 21.84 points, or 2.41 percent, to 929.23. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  rose 22.76 points, or 1.33 percent, to 1,739. For the week, the Dow rose 4.4 percent, the S&P 500 5.9 percent and the Nasdaq 1.2 percent. While the S&P and Nasdaq are positive for the year, the Dow is still lower. The dollar weakened as it tends to suffer when risk aversion ebbs and investors feel they no longer need to buy it as a safe haven. The dollar also fell to a four-month low against a basket of major currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index .DXY off 1.7 percent at 82.457. The euro gained 1.72 percent at $1.3629. Against the yen, the dollar fell 0.85 percent at 98.40. "The market is positioning for recovery over the next few months, which means the dollar will clearly see considerable weakness as this plays out," said Melvin Harris, chief market strategist at Advanced Currency Markets in New York. "The jobs data was encouraging, and any trader would tell you they've expected to see unemployment at 9 to 10 percent before this thing was over, so that's not a shock," he said. Although the drop in U.S. payrolls was less than expected, the news failed to dispel the likelihood of heavy job losses in the months ahead, pushing government debt prices higher. The jobs report included a few discouraging signs, such as a spike in the U.S. unemployment rate to 8.9 percent -- the highest since September 1983 -- helping spur a flight-to-safety bid in U.S. government debt. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose 14/32 in price to yield 3.29 percent. The 2-year U.S. Treasury note added 1/32 in price to yield 0.98 percent. U.S. crude gained $1.92 to settle at $58.63. New York gold futures ended lower as the improving economic sentiment prompted investors to take profits after a recent sharp rally. Gold for June delivery settled down 60 cents at $914.90 an ounce in New York. A rally in economically sensitive copper stalled after prices neared key technical levels. Copper, used extensively in construction, has doubled in value since the start of 2009. Copper for July delivery eased 1.90 cents to close at $2.1455 a pound in New York. "We don't have any actual improvement in demand yet, but clearly there is optimism right through the financial markets." said Stephen Briggs, a metals strategist at RBS Global Banking and Markets. The MSCI index of Asian stocks outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS rose 0.4 percent and Japan's Nikkei average  .N225  rose 0.5 percent to notch a new six-month close.
