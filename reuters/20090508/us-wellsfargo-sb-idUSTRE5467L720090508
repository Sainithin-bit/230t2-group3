 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co priced 341 million common shares at $22 per share on Friday, a source familiar with the matter said, raising a more-than-expected $7.5 billion in new equity, but at a discount of about 11 percent to their Thursday closing price. 

 On Thursday, the San Francisco bank said it planned to sell new stock to raise $6 billion. The deal priced a day after the U.S. Treasury made public the results of its "stress tests" of 19 major banks and deemed that Wells Fargo needed to boost capital by $13.7 billion. In a regulatory filing Thursday, Wells Fargo raised its expected credit writedowns on its impaired loan portfolio to $40 billion from $39 billion. (Reporting by Phil Wahba; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)
