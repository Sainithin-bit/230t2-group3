 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A weekly measure of U.S. future economic growth rose along with its annualized growth rate, indicating that economic recovery is imminent, a research group said Friday. 

 The Economic Cycle Research Institute, a New York-based independent forecasting group, said its Weekly Leading Index ticked up to a 17-week high of 109.3 for the week ending May 1 from 107.7 in the previous week. The index's annualized growth rate rose to a 30-week high of negative 16.1 percent from the prior week's rate of negative 17.5 percent. "The level of the WLI is fast approaching a six-month high, making it increasingly likely that the U.S. recession will end this summer," said Lakshman Achuthan, managing director at ECRI. The index level rose due to higher stock prices and stronger housing activity, partly offset by higher interest rates, Achuthan said. (Reporting by  Ciara Linnane ; Editing by  Chizu Nomiyama )
