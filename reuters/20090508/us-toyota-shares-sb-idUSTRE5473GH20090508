 DETROIT  (Reuters) - U.S.-listed shares of Toyota Motor Corp fell 1.4 percent on Friday after the world's biggest automaker forecast a much bigger-than-expected annual loss in the face of a severe market downturn. 

 Toyota, hit hard by the global slump in demand for cars that has pushed U.S. rival Chrysler into bankruptcy and General Motors Corp to the brink of failure, said it expected a $8.6 billion loss for the year ending next March. That more than doubled the average forecast compiled by Reuters Estimates. While the entire industry is caught in the downturn, Toyota has been especially vulnerable due to its exposure to the United States and Japan where sales have plunged to multi-decade lows. Toyota is struggling to turn around its U.S. business, which has long generated some of the company's biggest profits but has seen sales plunge amid the global economic downturn. Toyota's U.S. sales fell 42 percent in April, the second-biggest decline of any major automaker in the United States, behind bankrupt Chrysler. Its U.S. sales are down 38 percent through the first four months of the year, in line with the decline in the industry overall. Toyota's dismal outlook comes at a time when GM is scrambling to cut costs and debt under U.S. government oversight to avoid a potential bankruptcy filing. GM on Thursday reported a quarterly net loss of $6 billion and said it burned through more than $10 billion as it relied on a federal bailout to ride out the sharp sales decline. Analysts have said the failure of Chrysler or GM would be costly to all major automakers manufacturing in North America due to the interlocking chain of the U.S. supply base. Toyota's American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) were down 1.37 percent, or $1.10 to $79.14 in early trading. (Reporting by  Soyoung Kim )
