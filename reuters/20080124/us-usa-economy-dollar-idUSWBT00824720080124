 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Thursday reiterated that a strong U.S. dollar is in the nation's interest. 

 "A strong dollar is clearly in our nation's interest," he said at a briefing with President George W. Bush where they outlined proposals in a stimulus package aimed at keeping the economy from going into recession. "Our economy goes through ups and downs... I believe our fundamental long-term strength is going to be reflected in the currency markets," he said. (Reporting By Joanne Morrison; Editing by  Chizu Nomiyama )
