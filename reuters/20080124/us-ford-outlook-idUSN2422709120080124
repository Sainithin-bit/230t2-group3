 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) said on Thursday it expects U.S. industry light vehicle sales of about 16 million in 2008, slightly higher than a 15.7 million estimate a company economist gave last week. 

 Ford also said it expects 2008 U.S. market share for its Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brands to be at the low end of a 14 percent to 15 percent range. The company, which earlier announced offers of buyouts to its entire unionized work force, said it has nearly 12,000 union workers who are retirement-eligible. It said it had negotiated buyout packages with the United Auto Workers that were similar to previous attrition programs. Details on the buyouts will be released when the sign-up periods for the programs end, executives said in a conference call. (Reporting by  David Bailey , editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
