 PRAGUE  (Reuters) - Komercni Banka, the Czech unit of Societe Generale, said on Thursday the alleged fraud at the parent bank would have no impact on its results. 

 It declined to comment on any potential impact on dividends. Spokeswoman Romana Ondruskova said the bank may issue a statement relating to the situation later on Thursday. Trading in Komercni was restricted to a "closed phase" in which market makers are not obliged to quote prices. The stock was 2.49 percent up at 3,290 crowns at 0945 GMT, lagging the PX index which rose 4.11 percent. (Reporting by Jan Korselt, writing by Jan Lopatka; Editing by Paul Bolding)
