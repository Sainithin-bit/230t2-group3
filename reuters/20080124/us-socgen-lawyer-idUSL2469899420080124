 PARIS  (Reuters) - The French trader accused by Societe Generale of a fraud costing $7 billion is ready to talk to police, a woman identified as his lawyer told French television on Thursday. 

 "He is not running away. He is at the disposal of the police," lawyer Elisabeth Meyer told BFM TV. France's top banker dubbed the trader "a genius of fraud." Societe Generale declined to give a name, but three sources at the bank identified him as Jerome Kerviel, 31, a trader on the bank's award-winning equity derivatives desk earning less than 100,000 euros a year. Meyer could not be contacted immediately. (Reporting by  Rachel Sanderson ; editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)
