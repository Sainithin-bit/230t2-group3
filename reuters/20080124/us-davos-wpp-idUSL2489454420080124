 DAVOS, Switzerland  (Reuters) - The world's second-largest advertising and marketing company WPP's ( WPP.L )'s fourth-quarter results are in line with analyst expectations, Chief Executive Martin Sorrell said on Thursday. 

 "Q4 came along in line with our expectations and outside expectations," Sorrell said in an interview at the World Economic Forum which was broadcast in the virtual world of Second Life. Analysts on average expect WPP to post 2007 revenues of 6.13 billion pounds ($12 billion) and 2008 revenues of 6.50 billion pounds, according to Reuters Estimates. Sorrell declined to comment further on the fourth quarter, citing the company's closed period. "I will get taken away in manacles if I go into too much detail," he said. "The SEC ( U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) vets Second Life too." Sorrell also said the turmoil in the financial markets could mean a difficult 2009, despite record new business in the quarter due to new clients such as Dell DELL.O, and the advertising industry benefiting from the Beijing Summer Olympics and U.S. presidential elections. "We've cut back our operating companies in terms of their enthusiasm because I'm a bit nervous if they overestimate revenues they'll increase headcount in '08," he said.
