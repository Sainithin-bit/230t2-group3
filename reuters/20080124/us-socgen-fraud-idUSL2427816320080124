 (Reuters) - French bank Societe Generale (SocGen) ( SOGN.PA ) said fraud by a single trader had caused it a 4.9 billion euro ($7.1 billion) loss. Following are some details on the trader, the fraud and the bank: 

 THE SCANDAL: * SocGen blamed a lone, Paris-based trader in his thirties who handled futures contracts on European stock market indices, betting on broad share market movements. His salary was less than 100,000 euros a year. * The bank was in the process of dismissing him and said his managers would also leave the company. * SocGen is to raise 5.5 billion euros in fresh capital to strengthen its balance sheet. * The board rejected a resignation offer from Chairman and Chief Executive Daniel Bouton. Bouton and his deputy Philippe Citerne gave up their salaries for six months. * The bank announced further write-downs of 2.05 billion euros related to the global credit crunch. THE BANK: * Societe Generale was founded in 1864 in the reign of France's Emperor Napoleon III. * It employs around 120,000 people, more than 50 percent of them outside France, and has 22.5 million customers worldwide. * It is the Euro zone's seventh largest bank by market capitalization, according to Reuters data.
