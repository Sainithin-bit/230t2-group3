 LONDON/DUBAI  (Reuters) - Investors who picked Middle East stocks as an insurance policy say high oil prices still make the region a better long-term bet than many emerging markets, despite suffering a reality check this week. 

 For all the talk of their ability to withstand global financial market weakness, stocks across the Middle East tumbled this week in line with other emerging assets, recalling the 2006 crash that wiped billions of dollars off their value. Yet, looking beyond the falls, it is difficult to argue against the region's massive oil-backed surpluses, the likelihood of currency appreciation in the medium term and the countries' attempts to diversify their economies. "The Gulf is fundamentally sheltered from this global storm, as long as oil prices remain high," said Philip Khoury, head of research at Egyptian investment bank EFG-Hermes. A vast pool of local money, a pipeline of planned stock listings -- over a hundred by some counts -- economic growth above 5 percent and relatively low valuations all add to the lure. In the past year, foreigners have flooded into the more liquid Arab markets or bought into companies and countries exposed to the Gulf. For instance, fund consultancy EPFR reported allocations to Egypt -- often used as a proxy for the Gulf -- climbed to a seven-year high towards end-2007. All that fed into hefty gains in regional indexes last year with Dubai .DFMGI rising 44 percent, Abu Dhabi .ADI 52 percent, Qatar .QSI 34 percent and even the hard-to-access Saudi market .SASI 41 percent. The Cairo exchange .CASE30 also gained almost 40 percent. Michael Hartnett, head of emerging equity strategy at Merrill Lynch, identifies the Middle East as the pick of the frontier markets -- under-developed markets that are less liquid and less correlated with global markets but offer better returns. The lower the correlation, the less a market tends to react to global swings, making it a good play during volatile times. Hartnett estimates the recently launched MSCI frontier market index, of which Gulf stocks comprise 65 percent, has a monthly return correlation of 31 percent with the U.S. Standard & Poor's stock index  .SPX , versus 73 percent for mainstream emerging markets. Analysts say recent falls on Gulf bourses were driven by investors' need to re-jig portfolios and take profits in markets where they are still in the money. And markets largely recovered on Wednesday after countries like the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait followed the United States in lowering borrowing costs. Dubai led the Gulf rebound, surging a record 10.5 percent, and markets stabilized on Thursday. "As more and more foreigners have been buying, correlation with developed markets has gone up," said Nudgem Richyal, who co-manages $2.5 billion in emerging equities at Barings Asset Management in London. "But at the margins, the correlation is still going to be a lot less than mainstream emerging markets," he said, adding he plans to use any turbulence to double Gulf holdings to 10 percent of his portfolio. The stocks are still considered cheap. Until recently, trailing price-to-earnings valuations were 14.4 times, Hartnett estimates, versus 17 times for the MSCI benchmark emerging index. "Within frontier (markets), the Middle East markets look the most compellingly cheap," he says. VOLATILE? Yet, some investors are wary. The turbulence rekindles memories of the crash of 2006 that burned thousands of small investors across the region. Oliver Stoenner, head of emerging asset allocation strategy at German fund Cominvest, warns the Gulf is dominated by retail investors who tend to take fright easily. "What stabilizes mature markets are big institutional investors, like pension funds, which invest large amounts," he says. "Without big institutional investors these markets will remain volatile." Also, many markets offer limited access to non-Gulf investors, with Saudi stocks totally off-bounds without specialized investment vehicles. For this reason, most investors hold Gulf stocks in portfolios dominated by Turkey and Egypt, or seek exposure via third countries. Barings' Richyal, for instance, gets exposure via foreign firms like Korea's Doosan Heavy Industries ( 034020.KS ) which are involved in big Gulf projects. "It's a good way to play the Gulf capex boom. It's similar to when we first invested in China, we bought commodity stocks, now we go in and buy (Chinese stocks) directly," he said, predicting markets will gradually open up to foreigners. INFRASTRUCTURE The infrastructure boom and the domestic consumption story are the most compelling attractions of the Gulf, but high oil prices mean the lure here is even higher than in most emerging markets. Energy stocks are not available as oil firms are state run. Analysts say Gulf economies will do fine as long as oil stays above $35-$40 per barrel. With U.S. crude now around $88, such a huge drop looks unlikely even if a U.S. recession hits. Merrill's Hartnett forecasts Gulf states will accumulate current account surpluses of $750 million a day in 2008. Much of this is being ploughed into infrastructure, with spending projected at $150 billion over the next three years. With per capita incomes, already among the world's highest, rising steadily, consumer stocks also seem a good bet. Fidelity International asset manager Nick Price picks low-cost UAE airline Air Arabia AIRA.DU as an example of a firm benefiting from the region's development boom. Middle East air passenger volumes will grow 7 percent per annum for the next 10 years versus 4-5 percent for the rest of the world, Price says, noting the airline also targets price-conscious migrant workers from the Indian subcontinent and North Africa. "The flow of this labor population is dependent on job opportunities. These are driven by macroeconomic conditions in the Middle East that remain robust due to high oil prices."
