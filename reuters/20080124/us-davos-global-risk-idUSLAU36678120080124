 DAVOS, Switzerland  (Reuters) - A lack of international economic policy coordination to deal with the global credit crisis and looming world slowdown is seen as the biggest risk to the world economy this year, according to a vote of business and government leaders taken on Wednesday. 

 The votes were cast by dozens of delegates attending a global economic "brainstorming" workshop at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss ski resort of Davos. Of nine proposed major risks to global economic growth in 2008, 18.5 percent voted that a lack of a concerted response to the credit, banking and financial market turmoil of the past six months was the biggest threat. The preference narrowly won favor above overlapping concerns of a mismanagement of the crisis, which got 18.1 percent of the vote, and a broad based collapse in market, business and consumer confidence, which took 16.7 percent. The financial crisis has charged the atmosphere of the annual WEF gathering of 2,500 corporate and policy leaders from around the world since the steep stock market falls and dramatic U.S. interest rate cut earlier in the week. "The real problem for the world economy in 2008 is a lack of U.S. leadership," said former White House economic adviser Laura Tyson, reflecting the views of her panel of delegates. Other concerns included the risk of trade and investment protectionism, particularly if a U.S. recession hits in this presidential election year. Rising energy and commodity prices was another major concern as was the rise of inequality both within western economies and between the developed and the developing world. Egyptian finance minister Youssuf Boutros Ghali said many people on his panel preferred to focus on longer-term issues dogging the world economy beyond 2008, such as poverty and inequality. But he added: "There is no point looking beyond this year if the patient is already dead." For full coverage, blogs and TV from Davos see:  here (Reporting by  Mike Dolan , editing by Ralph Boulton)
