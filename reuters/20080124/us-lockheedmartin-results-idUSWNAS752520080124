 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp ( LMT.N ) said on Thursday fourth-quarter profit rose, helped by strong sales of its electronic warfare and space systems. 

 The world's largest defense contractor, which makes F-16 fighter jets and Patriot missiles, and carries out a host of civil government services, reported quarterly profit of $799 million, or $1.89 per share, compared with $729 million, or $1.68 per share, in the year-earlier quarter.
