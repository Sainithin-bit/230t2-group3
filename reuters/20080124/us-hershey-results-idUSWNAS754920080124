 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Hershey Co ( HSY.N ) on Thursday posted a sharp drop in quarterly profit, hurt by sluggish sales, restructuring charges and soaring costs for ingredients. 

 The company, which makes Hershey Kisses, Reese's peanut butter cups and a host of other candies, said profit was $54.3 million, or 24 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, compared with $153.6 million, or 65 cents as share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, earnings were 54 cents a share. Hershey has been hammered by rising costs for ingredients like milk and has also lost market share to Mars Inc. Its stock has fallen 28 percent in the past year. (Reporting by  Brad Dorfman ; Editing by John Wallace)
