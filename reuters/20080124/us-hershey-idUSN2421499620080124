 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Hershey Co ( HSY.N ) on Thursday forecast a drop in 2008 earnings as it tries to fix a U.S. candy business that has been losing market share to rivals like Mars Inc while it also copes with rising costs. 

 The company, which makes Hershey Kisses and Reese's peanut butter cups, also said profit fell 65 percent in the fourth quarter, hit by charges for the overhaul of its supply chain, impairment charges in its Brazil operations and flat sales. The news drove shares of Hershey down 2.2 percent on the New York Stock Exchange, bringing its stock decline to almost 30 percent in the past year. New Chief Executive David West said the company's primary goal in 2008 is to stabilize its U.S. business. Hershey plans to spend more on marketing and also offering new products, including a new line of chocolates developed with Starbucks Corp ( SBUX.O ). For 2008, the company forecast a 3 percent to 4 percent increase in sales and said earnings would be $1.85 to $1.90 before one-time items. The company reported earnings of $2.08 on that basis for 2007 and analysts, on average, forecast $21.16 a share for 2008. Hershey sales were hit over the past year as the company has had little success with new dark chocolate products, was slow to get into the premium chocolate market and has faced tough competition in the gum and mint business. Those three segments have been among the strongest in the confection business and have helped competitors weather soaring costs for ingredients and energy. "Other food companies aren't faring this bad even though they have cost environment difficulties in their own right," said Matt Arnold, an analyst at Edward Jones. But Jones also rates the stock "buy," saying the company appears to be set to spend the money it needs to spur sales growth. Hershey said profit was $54.3 million, or 24 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, compared with $153.6 million, or 65 cents as share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, earnings were 54 cents a share, a penny below the average analyst estimate compiled by Reuters Estimates. Sales were $1.34 billion, about flat with a year earlier. Aside from its financial performance, 2007 was also a year marked by turmoil at Hershey culminating in former Chief Executive Richard Lenny leaving the company and a sweeping overhaul of the company's board of directors. That overhaul was forced by the Hershey Trust, controlling about 78 percent of Hershey's voting shares, which voiced its displeasure with Hershey's results in October. Hershey shares were down 81 cents at $35.65 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by Brad Dorfman; Editing by  Brian Moss )
