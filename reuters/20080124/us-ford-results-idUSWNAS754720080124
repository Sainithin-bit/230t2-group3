 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) on Thursday posted a narrower fourth-quarter loss after cutting costs and boosting margins on vehicles and said it would offer broad buyouts to union workers in the United States. 

 The automaker reported a net loss of $2.75 billion, or $1.30 per share, compared with a loss of $5.63 billion, or $2.98 per share, a year earlier. Ford's loss from continuing operations, excluding one-time items, was 20 cents a share. On that basis, analysts expected a loss of 19 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates.
