 PARIS  (Reuters) - Societe Generale Chairman Daniel Bouton and his deputy Philippe Citerne will both give up their salary until June 30, Bouton said on Thursday after the bank uncovered an alleged 4.9 billion euro ($7.16 billion) fraud. 

 "We have given up our fixed salary until June 30 2008," Bouton said about his pay and that of Citerne. Asked if the trader behind the alleged fraud was on the run, Bouton replied: "I don't know." (Reporting by  Sudip Kar-Gupta )
