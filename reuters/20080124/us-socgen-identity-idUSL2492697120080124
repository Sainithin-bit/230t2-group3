 PARIS  (Reuters) - The trader at the heart of an alleged 4.9 billion euro fraud at French bank Societe Generale has been identified as Jerome Kerviel, three sources within the company said on Thursday. 

 The sources declined to be named. SocGen declined to comment. An e-mail sent to Kerviel's SocGen e-mail address did not work. A person who answered the telephone at a number for Kerviel supplied by a trading contact said, "He is not here at the moment. You will have to call back." SocGen said earlier it had been the victim of an exceptional fraud incurring losses of 4.9 billion euros due to the actions of one trader, whom it did not identify. It said the man involved was about 30, was relatively junior within the bank and had worked for SocGen since 2002. It said he had been suspended pending dismissal. Chairman Daniel Bouton said he did not know the trader's whereabouts.
