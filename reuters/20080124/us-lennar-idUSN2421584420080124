 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Lennar Corp ( LEN.N ), the No. 2 U.S. home builder, said on Thursday its fourth-quarter loss widened, orders for new homes fell 50 percent, and that the ailing U.S. housing market could worsen in the near term. 

 But the company's shares rose nearly 8 percent as analysts said Lennar was very successful paying down its debt, and generating cash to be in good position when the market turns. The U.S. housing market has been in a tailspin for more than two years, hounded by falling prices and evaporating demand. Groundbreaking on new U.S. homes last month was the slowest since 1991 and fewer building permits were issued than any time since 1993, pointing to a deepening housing crisis. To combat the effects the deteriorating U.S. housing market has inflicted globally, the Federal Reserve earlier this week slashed the benchmark federal Funds target rate by 75 basis points and the U.S. government is mulling mortgage rescue and economic stimulus plans. "As we look ahead to 2008, we are not expecting market conditions to improve, and perhaps might continue to decline in the near term," Stuart Miller, Lennar's chief executive, said in a statement. For the fiscal fourth quarter ended November 30, Lennar posted a net loss of $1.25 billion, or $7.92 a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $195.6 million, or $1.24 a share. New orders fell by half to 4,761 homes and the cancellation rate was 33 percent. "As we get to the back half the year, I do not expect to see sales and home prices accelerate but I'm just -- maybe I'm just hopeful. I'm hopeful that the slide does not continue at the accelerated rate," Miller said in a conference call with analysts. The quarterly results included a charge of $7.50 per share and reflect a $1.2 billion charge for the write-downs of land and inventory values, forfeited options, and goodwill charges. It includes a $740.4 million write-down for 11,000 lots Lennar sold at a loss into a fund it established with Morgan Stanley  ( MS.N ). Lennar originally bought the property for $1.45 billion, Miller said. Because of the losses, Lennar received a cash tax refund of $852 million after the close of the quarter. In response to the deteriorating market, U.S. home builders have shifted their focus from profit and growth to survival, focusing on generating cash to pay off debt and getting rid of the excessive land and inventory they accumulated during the boom times. Lennar reduced its debt by $318 million year over year, ending the quarter with $642.5 million in cash on its balance sheet. It said it continued to believe it would end its fiscal year in November cash-flow positive. "We continue to believe that management is taking the right steps (discounting home prices, selling land) to generate cash and that the resulting balance sheet flexibility is critical to navigate the current downturn," Bank of America Securities analyst Daniel Oppenheim wrote in a research note. Lennar also reached agreements with its lenders to amend the terms of its senior unsecured revolving credit facility. The agreement tightens lending standards and more than halves the maximum amount the can borrow to $1.5 billion from $3.1 billion. In the fourth quarter, home-sale revenue fell 51 percent to $2 billion as the number of homes sold, excluding unconsolidated joint ventures, dropped 49 percent to 6,810. Greater incentives of about $58,000 per home pressed the average sale price down 3.6 percent to $291,000. Shares of Lennar were up $1.16 at $16.10 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
