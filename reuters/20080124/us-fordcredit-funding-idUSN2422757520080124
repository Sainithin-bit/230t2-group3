 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Credit Co., the financing arm of Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ), plans to issue $10 billion to $20 billion of public debt in 2008, compared with $12 billion last year, the company said in a slide presentation posted on its Web site. 

 Separate private funding, which includes whole loan sales, structured financings and other private transactions, will likely be in the $10 billion to $20 billion range, down from $28 billion in 2007, the company said. Ford said it plans to continue to expand asset-backed, or securitized debt sales, issuing $10 billion to $16 billion in that market this year, up from $6 billion in 2007. Unsecured debt sales will total up to $4 billion, down from $6 billion in 2007, the company said. (Reporting by  Dena Aubin , editing by Tom Hals)
