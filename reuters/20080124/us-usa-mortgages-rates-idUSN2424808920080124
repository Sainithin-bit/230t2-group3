 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Interest rates on U.S. 30-year mortgages fell to their lowest averages in nearly four years, according to a weekly survey released by Freddie Mac on Thursday. 

 U.S. 30-year mortgage rates fell to an average of 5.48 percent from 5.69 percent a week earlier, and the lowest since touching 5.40 percent in the week ended March 25, 2004, Freddie Mac said. Fifteen-year mortgage rates fell to an average of 4.95 percent -- the lowest since hitting 4.84 percent in the April 1, 2004 week -- from 5.21 percent the prior week. One-year adjustable rate mortgages (ARM) dipped to an average of 4.99 percent from 5.26 percent last week. Freddie Mac said the "5/1" ARM, set at a fixed rate for five years and adjustable each following year, averaged 5.13 percent, down from 5.40 percent last week. In the same period a year ago, 30-year mortgages averaged 6.25 percent, 15-year mortgages 5.98 percent and the one-year ARM 5.49 percent. The 5/1 ARM averaged 6.00 percent. "Economic news released last week confirmed the weak condition of the housing market," said Frank Nothaft, Freddie Mac vice president and chief economist. Earlier on Thursday, the National Association of Realtors said U.S. December existing homes sales fell 2.2 percent to a 4.89 million unit annual rate. Total 2007 sales fell 12.8 percent from the previous year. Also this week, the Federal Reserve in an unscheduled move decided to cut the benchmark federal funds rate by 75 basis points to 3.5 percent stimulate the economy. Lenders charged an average of 0.4 percent in fees and points on 30-year mortgages, down from 0.5 percent last week. They charged 0.4 percent on the 5/1 ARM, down from 0.6 percent a week earlier. Fees and points on 15-year mortgages averaged 0.4 percent and the one-year ARM 0.6 percent, both unchanged from last week. Freddie Mac is a mortgage finance company chartered by Congress that buys mortgages from lenders and packages them into securities to sell to investors or to hold in its own portfolio.
