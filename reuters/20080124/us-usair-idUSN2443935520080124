 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - US Airways Group ( LCC.N ) posted a quarterly loss on Thursday, hurt by soaring fuel costs that have battered the airline industry. 

 The carrier's results, along with a loss reported by Alaska Air Group ( ALK.N ), underscore the vulnerability of airlines to record-high fuel prices. In the last few days, American Airlines parent AMR Corp AMR.N, United Airlines parent UAL Corp UAUA.O and Delta Air Lines ( DAL.N ) have all reported losses. With a softening U.S. economy likely to sap travel demand, U.S. airlines may continue to struggle to raise fares to offset higher fuel costs. "As we begin 2008, our industry appears to be headed for another difficult period due to extremely high oil prices and a potentially softening economy," US Airways Chief Executive Doug Parker said in a statement. US Airways' shares were down 2.4 percent at $12.90 around midday on the New York Stock Exchange. Alaska Air shares lost 5.5 percent to $23.22. Airline stocks were generally weaker on Thursday with the Amex airline index  .XAL  down 1.75 percent as the price of crude oil, which is directly related to the price of jet fuel, gained 87 cents to $87.86 a barrel. Jim Corridore, an airline analyst at Standard & Poor's, said results in the fourth quarter -- traditionally a weak period for travel -- are not necessarily cause for alarm. "None of the airlines have actually seen any evidence of softening in bookings," Corridore said. "It's kind of a mixed bag there." But US Airways President Scott Kirby said the company is on the lookout for any signs of weaker demand. "We remain concerned that economic weakness at some point will translate into revenue pressure," Kirby said, adding that the concern is spurred by media speculation on a recession and not by US Airways data. US AIRWAYS SLUMPS TO LOSS US Airways said its fourth-quarter loss amounted to $79 million, or 87 cents per share, compared with a profit of $12 million, or 13 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, the company said its loss was 45 cents per share. On that basis, analysts' average forecast was a loss of 83 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. One-time items included a $99 million increase to long-term disability obligations for pilots, merger-related expenses of $15 million, and a $59 million noncash credit for unrealized net gains associated with the company's fuel hedge. Operating revenue fell 0.4 percent to $2.78 billion. The airline's fuel bill jumped 27 percent to $730 million. US Airways ended the quarter with $3 billion in cash and investments. ALASKA AIR LOSS WIDENS Alaska Air reported a wider fourth-quarter loss before special items, citing sharply higher fuel costs and the inability of fares to keep pace with rising costs. The parent of Alaska Airlines and regional carrier Horizon Air said the loss widened to $17.9 million, or 46 cents per share, from $3.4 million, or 8 cents per share, a year earlier. "It's frustrating to report a fourth quarter adjusted loss in what has been a solid year relative to other carriers," Bill Ayer, chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement. "The loss was driven primarily by skyrocketing fuel costs combined with fares that have not kept pace," Ayer said. Including the impact of fuel hedge accounting adjustments, the company reported fourth-quarter net income of $7.4 million, or 19 cents per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $11.6 million, or 29 cents per share, in 2006.
