 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Sun Microsystems Inc JAVA.O, the world's fourth-largest server-computer maker, said on Thursday quarterly profit doubled, sending the shares up. 

 Net income rose to $260 million, or 31 cents per share, for Sun's fiscal 2008 second quarter ended December 30, from $133 million, or 15 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue increased 1.4 percent to $3.62 billion from $3.57 billion. The company's gross profit margin increased 3.5 percentage points to 48.5 percent. Sun recorded $32 million of restructuring charges in the period. Sun said last week it expected to report second-quarter earnings of $230 million to $265 million, or 28 cents per share to 32 cents per share. It said revenue was about $3.6 billion, an increase of about 1 percent over the year-earlier amount. Its shares, down 18 percent this year through Wednesday, added 1.1 percent in extended trading following the earnings report after closing up 8.8 percent at $16.12 on Nasdaq. Sun, based in Santa Clara, California, has been trying a comeback under Chief Executive Jonathan Schwartz, cutting jobs, selling server computers with processors from Advanced Micro Devices Inc ( AMD.N ) and Intel Corp ( INTC.O ) in addition to its own chips and growing in software. Last week, Sun said it would buy Swedish database-software maker MySQL AB for about $1 billion to drive growth in its software services business. Schwartz said in a statement Thursday the second-quarter results "highlight the demand set to fuel growth in the back half of the fiscal year." The company had double-digit percentage growth in emerging markets including India, China, Latin America, Eastern Europe and the Middle East during the second quarter. It also signed an agreement for Dell Inc DELL.O, the world's second-largest personal-computer maker, to sell computers with Sun's Solaris operating system.
