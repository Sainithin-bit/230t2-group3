 PARIS  (Reuters) - French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde said on Thursday that the losses suffered by Societe Generale as a result of fraud should not be confused with the problems on the subprime market. 

 "This fraud should be very clearly distinguished from the provisions taken by Societe Generale elsewhere, which are provisions for losses linked to the subprime mortgage market in the United States," she during question time in the Senate. She said Societe Generale had announced a capital increase to shore up its capital. "I think, given the diagnosis which has been undertaken and the capital increase that has been launched, there is no need for worries of this kind and particularly to mix up the different provisions and losses that have been announced."
