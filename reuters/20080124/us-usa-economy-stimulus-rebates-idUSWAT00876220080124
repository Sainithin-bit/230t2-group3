 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Thursday 117 million families would receive a tax rebate check under a deal reached to provide stimulus to the U.S. economy. 

 A fact sheet released by the California Democrat said the individuals would receive tax relief of up to $600, while married couples would see help up to $1,200, plus $300 per child. The document also said the limit on the size of mortgages that government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can buy would be increased for one year to $625,500 from the current $417,000.
