 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - EBay Inc warned that 2008 results would fall below Wall Street expectations, sending its stock down more than 5 percent even as it confirmed long-serving Chief Executive Meg Whitman would step aside. 

 The forecast accompanied solid fourth-quarter results, and analysts said it was unclear if the company feared an economic slowdown or whether management was giving itself room to make changes to revitalize the business. Growth in the main auction business has slowed during the past three years. Auctions chief John Donahoe will take over from Whitman at the end of March. Whitman will remain on eBay's board of directors and take on an advisory role through the end of 2008 on a reduced salary, she said in an interview. Donahoe told a conference call with investors that eBay would cut sellers' fees, which would reduce revenue temporarily, but stimulate long-term growth. "We are going to make breaks from the past," Donahoe told investors on a conference call to discuss the results. The share fall erased most of the day's gain. EBay shares had closed up 6.7 percent at $28.94 in Nasdaq trading on news the CEO change was imminent, but before the results. After the report, the stock fell 5.6 percent to $27.58 in extended trade. The share price has fallen by half from a peak in late 2004. "Problems that were weighing on eBay continue to weigh on eBay," said analyst Jim Friedland of brokerage Cowen & Co. "There are (many) more options to sellers on the market ... many of which are cheaper to sellers," the analyst said of online retail alternatives such as Amazon.com Inc or independent sites that rely on ads to drive traffic to them. For the current quarter, eBay said it expected revenue of $2.00 billion to $2.05 billion -- below Wall Street's average forecast of $2.14 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. "Consumers are clearly being more conservative," Whitman said in a joint interview with Donahoe on cable TV channel CNBC. "I anticipate we will see an increase in casual sellers who are supplementing their income." EBay at least partly benefited during the economic downturn of 2001-2002, allowing people who had lost their jobs to start businesses on eBay, Whitman told Reuters. Some 1.3 million people now derive at least part of their livelihood on eBay. OUTLOOK TRIMMED The San Jose, California-based company expects 2008 revenue of $8.50 billion to $8.75 billion, which at its midpoint represents 12 percent growth -- far below the $9.02 billion, or 18 percent growth, that analysts had expected on average. "We intend to be in a stronger position coming out of '08 than we were coming in," Donahoe said on the conference call. The dour outlook came as eBay posted a 53 percent surge in fourth-quarter net income to $531 million, or 39 cents per diluted share, from $346.5 million, or 25 cents per diluted share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, the latest quarter's profit was $611 million, or 45 cents a share. Analysts had expected 33 cents per share, on average, according to Reuters Estimates, and excluding one-time items and stock-based compensation, the average was 41 cents. Fourth-quarter net revenue rose 27 percent to $2.18 billion, against an average forecast of $2.14 billion. When Whitman joined a decade ago, eBay had $4 million in revenue and just 30 employees. It has since grown to 15,000 employees and has expanded into a variety of businesses. Fourth-quarter growth was led by non-auction business such as its retail-like "fixed price" sites; PayPal, with 35 percent revenue growth; Web-based phone company Skype; ticketing site StubHub; and classified ads and other advertising. EBay said 2008 net earnings, excluding one-time items and option expenses, would be $1.63 to $1.67 per diluted share -- at or below the $1.67 average analyst forecast. "We are clear about the challenges we have ahead of us," Chief Financial Officer Bob Swan said on the conference call. EBay plans to cut the fees it charges sellers across auctions in its three biggest markets -- the United States, Germany and Britain, executives told investors. Next week, eBay will announce changes in the pricing of its services and improvements in the way buyers can rate sellers, Donahoe said. Responding to defections by its key network of auction sellers, eBay plans to reduce the upfront fees sellers must pay to insert new listings on its auction sites, along with reductions in the final transaction fees they pay on successful sales, according to a company presentation on eBay's site. The growth rate for the total value of goods sold on eBay slid to 12 percent during the fourth quarter of 2007 from a rate of 20 percent during the final quarter of 2006.
