 PARIS  (Reuters) - The head of French bank Societe Generale ( SOGN.PA ) said on Thursday that his position on any mergers for the bank was unchanged despite the discovery of an alleged 4.9 billion euro ($7.16 billion) fraud at the bank. 

 Chairman Daniel Bouton told analysts on a conference call that any proposal would have to be examined in the best interests of shareholders, customers and staff and that the fraud episode would not change this. "I will not change this analysis," said Bouton. Asked by an analyst if the fraud hit would make it more likely that SocGen would enter into a merger deal, Bouton replied: "We are not looking specifically for this." Analysts said the fraud blow might rekindle long-standing market speculation that SocGen might merge or be taken over by BNP Paribas ( BNPP.PA ), France's biggest listed bank. In April 2007, Italian bank UniCredit ( CRDI.MI ) said it was talking to SocGen about "growth opportunities" although both banks denied that they were discussing a merger.
