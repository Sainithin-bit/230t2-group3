 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The loan limit U.S. mortgage funders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can finance will be raised to $625,000 from the current $417,000 in an economic stimulus package now being put together by lawmakers, sources familiar with the negotiations said on Thursday. 

 While many lawmakers favor a plan that would raise the conforming loan limit across the country to $625,000, several sources said the final plan might be narrowly tailored to raise the loan level for some high-cost metro areas as high as $700,000. A Treasury Department spokeswoman said on Thursday that the department opposes expanding the loan size for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac before lawmakers pass comprehensive reform.
