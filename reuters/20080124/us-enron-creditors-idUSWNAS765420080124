 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Enron Corp creditors said on Thursday they have filed court documents seeking remedies from benefits outsourcing firm Hewitt Associates Inc HEW.N for mistakes made in allocating funds from legal settlements stemming from the energy trader's collapse. 

 Enron Creditors Recovery Corp, the successor to bankrupt Enron, said it had filed two motions in recent days before U.S. District Court Judge Melinda Harmon in Houston regarding the matter. Thousands of settlement fund claimants were incorrectly distributed funds due to Hewitt's admitted mistakes, including an internal software error, according to the Enron creditors.
