 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The pilots of Northwest Airlines Corp 
NWA.N said on Thursday they would support a Northwest merger 
with another carrier but, in return, want a stake in the 
combined airline. 

  "We would agree to be favorable toward a merger if the 
right partner could be found," Greg Rizzuto, a spokesman for 
Northwest's pilots union, told Reuters. "For that, we'd want 
job security for our pilots, contract improvements ... as well 
as an equity stake.  "We need a viable company that can survive the economic ups 
and downs and $100 a barrel oil," Rizzuto said in a telephone 
interview.  Delta reportedly started merger talks earlier this month 
with Northwest and United Airlines' parent UAL Corp UAUA.O. 
The airlines have declined to comment.  On Thursday, Delta repeated its statement that it is not 
providing updates of its ongoing strategic review. Northwest 
declined to comment.  The statement is the latest sign the airline industry's 
powerful labor unions are willing to back a merger, providing 
they get something in return.  Northwest's flight attendants, which like the carrier's 
pilots were forced to accept deep wage cuts while Northwest was 
in bankruptcy protection, said earlier this week that its 
backing of a merger would be conditional on job protection, 
higher wages and a stake in the combined company.  (Reporting by  Chris Reiter ; Editing by  Andre Grenon  and
