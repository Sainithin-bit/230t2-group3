 DAVOS, Switzerland  (Reuters) - Policymakers should not overreact to heavy losses at European banks, but financial market turmoil does increase the risk to economic growth, European monetary affairs commissioner Joaquin Almunia said on Thursday. 

 "The markets know the estimates of losses from the subprime crisis and so I think we need not overreact. We need to keep calm and not to have kneejerk reactions," he said in an interview with Reuters at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Earlier French bank Societe Generale reported another 2 billion euro writedown of debt related to the U.S. subprime mortgage debt crisis, plus an additional five billion in losses from a fraudulent trade. Asked about Societe Generale, Almunia said it was a challenging time. "I know we are living in a difficult period, we know the estimates of the amount of losses that will appear as a consequence of the subprime crisis," he said. "Market participants are nervous, risk appetite has diminished." As a result, the commissioner said he expects next month to revise down slightly the existing euro zone economic growth forecast for 2008 from 2.2 percent at present. "We know that the balances of risks for growth have increased. At the same time, we have to face inflationary pressures," Almunia said. "This will cut our growth forecast for 2008 but not in a substantial way." "I am confident we will be successful in dealing with this shock. In Europe our economic fundamentals are solid and this is one good asset to tackle this situation." DEFENDS ECB Almunia defended the European Central Bank's interest rate stance and said it had already acted quickly and soundly to ease banking stress with liquidity. But unlike the U.S. Federal Reserve, which announced its biggest interest rate cut in more than 20 years this week after severe equity market losses, Almunia said the ECB job was more complex and it needed to keep a focus on inflation. "They have to keep in mind that their mandate is to preserve price stability and not to encourage the disanchoring of inflation expectations." ECB policymakers have held euro zone interest rates at 4 percent and have even discussed raising them due to high inflation, despite the market turmoil. On fiscal policy, Almunia said that European Union governments which had kept a tight rein on their budgets during the buoyant economic climate over the past two years may now have room to relax a bit during a period of sub-par growth. "For the European economies who have pursued an ambitious consolidation of fiscal policies during the past three years -- now they have the possibilities of letting their automatic stabilizers play their role," he said.
