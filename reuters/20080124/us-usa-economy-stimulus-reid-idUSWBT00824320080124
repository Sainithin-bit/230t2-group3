 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on Thursday confirmed a tentative agreement had been reached on economic stimulus legislation that he said could change in the Senate after the House of Representatives passes it. 

 "We're going to take another look at it when it comes here (to the Senate)," Reid, a Nevada Democrat, said, adding that Congress will try to send President George W. Bush the legislation before a mid-February recess. Earlier on Thursday, aides close to the talks said the White House and leaders in the House had reached accord on a $150 billion package to help ward off a possible recession in the U.S. economy.
