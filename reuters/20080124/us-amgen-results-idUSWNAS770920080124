 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Amgen ( AMGN.O ) reported on Thursday that its fourth-quarter profit edged higher as cost cutting helped offset declining sales of its anemia drugs that have been hit with safety concerns and new restrictions on their use and insurance reimbursements. 

 The company also said its closely watched experimental osteoporosis drug denosumab met all goals of a key clinical study, comparing it to a widely used treatment. The world's biggest biotechnology company by sales posted a quarterly net profit of $835 million, or 76 cents per share, compared with a profit of $833 million, or 71 cents per share, a year ago. Excluding items, Amgen earned $1.00 per share. Analysts on average expected 97 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Amgen shares have lost about a third of their value since the beginning of 2007 as a steady drumbeat of negative news involving its anemia franchise took a heavy toll. (Reporting by  Bill Berkrot )
