 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Sun Microsystems Inc JAVA.O, the world's fourth-largest server-computer maker, said on Thursday that quarterly profit doubled amid strong growth in emerging markets. 

 Net income rose to $260 million, or 31 cents per share, for Sun's fiscal 2008 second quarter ended December 30, from $133 million, or 15 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue increased 1.4 percent to $3.62 billion from $3.57 billion. The company said it had double-digit percentage growth in emerging markets including India, China, Latin America, Eastern Europe and the Middle East during the second quarter. Revenue decreased 8 percent in the United States and the region accounted for a smaller slice of total sales, but Chief Executive Jonathan Schwartz repeated on a conference call with analysts that the company had not felt the effects of the U.S. economic slowdown. "We saw strong demand in the second half of the quarter despite a slowing U.S. economy" Schwartz said. The company's gross profit margin increased 3.5 percentage points to 48.5 percent. Sun executives told analysts they expect a gross profit margin of 45 percent to 47 percent for the current fiscal year and revenue growth of at least 5 percent in the second half as Sun targets full-year revenue growth in the low to mid-single digit percentage range. Sun recorded $32 million of restructuring charges in the period. Sun said in a preliminary earnings report last week that it expected to report second-quarter earnings of $230 million to $265 million, or 28 cents per share to 32 cents per share. It said revenue was about $3.6 billion, an increase of about 1 percent over the year-earlier amount. Its shares, down 18 percent this year through Wednesday, added 13 cents in extended trading following the earnings report after closing up 8.8 percent at $16.12 on Nasdaq. Sun, based in Santa Clara, California, has been trying to make a comeback under Schwartz, cutting jobs, selling server computers with processors from Advanced Micro Devices Inc ( AMD.N ) and Intel Corp ( INTC.O ) in addition to its own chips and growing in software. Last week, Sun said it would buy Swedish database-software maker MySQL AB for about $1 billion to drive growth in its software services business. Sun expects restructuring charges of as much as $50 million when the deal closes, probably in the third or fourth quarter. Schwartz said in a statement on Thursday the second-quarter results "highlight the demand set to fuel growth in the back half of the fiscal year." Second-quarter growth was helped by an agreement for Dell Inc DELL.O, the world's second-largest personal-computer maker, to sell computers with Sun's Solaris operating system, Sun said.
