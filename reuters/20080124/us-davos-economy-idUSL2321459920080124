 DAVOS, Switzerland  (Reuters) - Following are highlights of comments at a forum on sovereign wealth funds made by participants at the World Economic Forum on Thursday. 

 ROBERT KIMMITT, U.S. DEPUTY SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY: "Both fund management and investment decision we have seen have been made on commercial not political grounds. We welcome that kind of investment in the United States. We don't fear such investment. "The growth in the size of these funds...means vigilance is required." LAWRENCE SUMMERS, FORMER U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY "I would agree that the world is a better place because of those transactions that have taken place over the past three months. There's not much that sovereign funds (have done) to date that one can be critical of. "I do think there is potential grounds for concern here. "Given we have made a decision that we are not going to invest our country's money in companies because of the risk of politicization, then it's legitimate to be concerned about other countries' use of those funds. "The question is if we believe in market economies and we work very hard to create open markets and private enterprise -- shouldn't we be concerned with transactions that have an element, albeit a small element, of cross border nationalization?" STEPHEN SCHWARZMAN, CHAIRMAN AND CEO OF BLACKSTONE GROUP: "Our experience with sovereign wealth funds is they are smart, long term, highly professional. All they are looking for is higher rate of return. "We have a sovereign wealth fund as our largest stakeholder. It is indicative of the way a sovereign wealth fund would think. The first thing about that investment is it is a non-voting investment - that was important for them. "We had originally asked them to vote with us, and they'd said they (would rather not). They are also a long-term shareholder." KRISTIN HALVORSEN, NORWEGIAN FINANCE MINISTER: "The fund is an extremely long-term investor. In principal we are going to be shareholders forever. We are extremely transparent. Our investment guidelines are discussed in parliament each year. "We have a very long-term horizon and that is not only to stabilize the Norwegian economy but also to stabilize global economy. We have ethical guidelines, to avoid our investments contribute to unethical acts. We are exercising these guidelines through our ownership rights." MOHAMED AL-JASSER, VICE GOVERNOR OF SAUDI ARABIAN MONETARY  AGENCY: "They have always taken a long-term stabilizing role in financial markets. "I don't think there are any difficulties in understanding who is investing where. Regulators... make sure it is well-known and compliant with regulations. "We should not look at sovereign wealth funds as a risk and a danger. "Between the years 1983 and 2002 we had 20 years of budget deficits. "We need to provide oil for the world economy. We have managed that well for the sake of our economy but also for the sake of the global economy." BADER AL SA'AD, MANAGING DIRECTOR OF KUWAIT INVESTMENT  AUTHORITY: "There is a lot of worry about sovereign wealth funds, but all of them are assumptions, they are not about real cases. "Kuwait has been a shareholder in DaimlerBenz since 1969, it has probably been one of the most stable shareholders. "Kuwait investment authority has one of the most regulated investment authorities. It is really well governed. "For 55 years, we never had politically enforced decisions for our investment. "We look at the bottom line, we don't look at anything else. We have been passive in all our investments. We haven't been active in any of our (holdings). All this fear about sovereign wealth funds has no real basis."
