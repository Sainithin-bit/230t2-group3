 SEATTLE  (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp ( MSFT.O ) reported a rise in quarterly profit on Thursday, boosted by strong computer sales that are driving sales of its Windows operating system and Office software. 

 The world's largest software maker said net profit in its fiscal second quarter rose to $4.7 billion, or 50 cents per diluted share, from $2.6 billion, or 26 cents per diluted share, in the year-ago period. Revenue rose 30 percent to $16.37 billion. Analysts, on average, had forecast Microsoft to earn 46 cents per share on revenue of $15.94 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Microsoft posted strong sales of Windows Vista, helped by double-digit percentage growth rates in computer sales in the December quarter. A strong performance at its Windows units drove Microsoft's first-quarter results, which far exceeded Wall Street's expectations. Shares of Microsoft surged to their highest levels since 2001 after the September-quarter results. As of the close of trade on Wednesday, the stock had fallen more than 10 percent since then due in part to economic concerns and declines in the broader market.
