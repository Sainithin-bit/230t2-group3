 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Amgen Inc ( AMGN.O ) said on Thursday that fourth-quarter profit edged higher, helped by cost cutting, and relieved investors with stronger than expected sales of all its key products. 

 Amgen shares rose 6 percent to $49 in after-hours trading despite a sharp decline in its top-selling anemia drug, Aranesp, which has been hit with safety concerns and new restrictions on use and insurance reimbursements. "Across the board basically all their products were higher than people thought," said Christopher Raymond, an analyst with Robert Baird. "Revenue driven upside, that's something we haven't seen with Amgen for a long time." Worldwide sales of the red blood cell booster Aranesp -- long seen as Amgen's most important product -- plunged 25 percent to $827 million, marking the fourth successive quarterly decline, as tighter insurance coverage guidelines continued to weigh. But that easily beat analysts' diminished expectations of $739 million and the previous quarter's $818 million. Investors, however, are still awaiting another review on Aranesp use by U.S. health regulators in March that could further impact its future sales. "Talking to investors, that's first and foremost on everyone's mind: Is there another left hook that we could expect from FDA?" Raymond said. The world's largest biotechnology company by sales posted a quarterly net profit of $835 million, or 76 cents per share, compared with a profit of $833 million, or 71 cents per share, a year ago. Excluding items, Amgen earned $1.00 per share, topping analysts' average expectations by 3 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. The company also said its closely watched experimental osteoporosis drug denosumab met all goals of a nonpivotal clinical study comparing it to a widely used treatment. While analysts said the bone density data looked good, most are awaiting results, expected in the second half of this year, from a pivotal study of the drug's effectiveness in preventing fractures. Amgen forecast 2008 earnings, excluding items, of $4.00 to $4.30 per share and revenue of $14.2 billion to $14.6 billion. Analysts are looking for $4.35 per share and $14.5 billion. "Amgen's 2008 guidance could be viewed as a little disappointing because some estimates had been higher, but we think the forecast is appropriate," said Cowen and Co analyst Eric Schmidt. On a conference call, Amgen Chief Executive Kevin Sharer declined to say whether the low end of the company's profit outlook would hold if the FDA were to restrict Aranesp's use in line with recently-tightened Medicare reimbursement guidelines. He also said the company is seeking to out-license some products. "The bottom line is we have more assets in our pipeline than we can develop ourselves," Sharer said. Looking ahead, the CEO said Amgen aims to become "quite a bit more diversified company both in therapeutic areas and geography. ... But I don't think the company is so concentrated right now that it's imperative that we do some M&A (mergers and acquisitions) move to change that profile." Second-quarter revenue declined 2 percent to $3.75 billion, topping Wall Street expectations of $3.55 billion. The older anemia drug Epogen, primarily used in kidney dialysis patients, saw sales decline 3 percent to $638 million, also beating analyst estimates of $595 million. Combined global sales of Neulasta and Neupogen, used to boost white blood cells, rose 9 percent to $1.12 billion. Sales of Enbrel for rheumatoid arthritis and the skin condition psoriasis rose 8 percent to $856 million. While that also beat expectations, Enbrel going forward is expected to face tougher competition on the psoriasis front after Abbott Laboratories Inc's ( ABT.N ) Humira was approved for the condition last week. Amgen is also facing an investigation into its Enbrel marketing practices.
