 PARIS  (Reuters) - Societe Generale shares fell more than 6 percent after being suspended earlier on Thursday in the wake of the French bank's report of a fraud that would lead to a 4.9 billion euro ($7.16 billion) hit to its accounts. 

 Societe Generale shares were down 6.15 percent at 74.22 euros by 6:19 a.m. EST. (Reporting by Marie Maitre, editing by Astrid Wendlandt; Editing by Paul Bolding)
