 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The cost of an economic stimulus package moving through Congress could exceed $150 billion, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said on Thursday. 

 Speaking to reporters, the Nevada Democrat said the legislation, which will provide tax rebates and business incentives to stimulate the flagging economy, will also have housing mortgage provisions for FHA, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. "We also understand that they're going to raise the loan limits for FHA and also include Fannie and Freddie," Reid said. (Reporting by  Richard Cowan ; Editing by  John O'Callaghan )
