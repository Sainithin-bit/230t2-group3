 PARIS  (Reuters) - French Budget Minister Eric Woerth said on Thursday Societe Generale was "solid" but he had no comment on the massive case of fraud that has hit France's second-largest listed bank. 

 "It's not for me to comment on Societe Generale," he told RTL radio. "Societe Generale is a solid and serious bank," he said, adding that Economy Minister Christine Lagarde would be commenting on the case at an appropriate time. (Reporting by  James Mackenzie )
