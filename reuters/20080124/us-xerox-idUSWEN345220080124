 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Xerox Corp ( XRX.N ), the leading provider of digital printers and document management services, posted a better-than-expected rise in quarterly profit on Thursday, fueled by growing revenue from financing and supplies, sending its beleaguered stock up over 7 percent. 

 The company, whose growth is driven by the sale and leasing of high-end printing machines and services, also said it is on track to meet its 2008 full-year profit forecast, and plans to increase its stock buyback plan by $1 billion. Xerox rebounded from fiscal troubles earlier this decade, spurred by solid profits and improved market share. It is still looking to boost revenue and lift its stock, which recently traded at two-year-lows amid broader declines sparked by concerns that a weak U.S. economy would hurt capital spending. But Larry Zimmerman, Xerox's Chief Financial Officer, told Reuters in an interview that economic jitters have not hurt its business. "Signings for big deals were up significantly and ... those are large accounts," he said. "There is some anecdotal evidence that there was some delay in decision-making in some accounts, but it doesn't necessarily indicate anything about the economy." The shares of Norwalk, Connecticut-based Xerox rose 7.5 percent on Thursday afternoon to $14.24 on the New York Stock Exchange. To be sure, the rise recoups only a fraction of the losses sustained by Xerox shares, which slipped on Wednesday to a 27- month low. The stock has declined about 23 percent over the past three months, compared with a 13 percent drop by the S&P 500 over the same period. Chief Executive Anne Mulcahy said economic jitters have not hurt the company beyond what she called "a slowdown in the corporate environment," which was offset by strength in business from small-and-medium sized firms and overall service contract signings. "Because of the diversity of our segments and our geographies and the annuity-based business, we would not point to any particular aspect of the economy that would have been a big issue for our results," she said. "Can we weather continued pressure in the equipment sales area? Yes." RECURRING REVENUE AT 70 PERCENT Analysts said they were impressed by Xerox's better-than- expected cash generation, which at $1 billion, was 42 percent higher than one analyst's target. More than 70 percent of Xerox's revenue is now recurring through lucrative long-term supply, financing and service deals to its commercial printing customers. "Their restructuring has changed the direction of the company fundamentally and strengthened it," said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management, which does not hold Xerox shares. "The focus on renewables is a strategy that has worked for others like HP ( HPQ.N ) and Xerox appears to be making it work." Xerox's net income in the fourth quarter rose to $382 million, or 41 cents a share, from $214 million, or 22 cents a share, a year earlier. The 2006 period included 16 cents a share in restructuring costs. Total revenue rose 11 percent to $4.88 billion. Wall Street analysts had expected a profit of 40 cents a share on revenue of $4.83 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. "At the end of the day their biggest focus is placing equipment so that they can generate the high profit of post- sale revenue. We are seeing that come through in the cash flow," said analyst Shannon Cross of Cross Research. During the fourth quarter, revenue from color systems and services rose 14 percent and now represents 40 percent of Xerox's total sales. Gross profit for color printed pages is five times greater than from black and white. "This past year more than 40 billion pages were printed on Xerox color systems, (up) 30 percent over 2006," said Mulcahy on a conference call. "We are miles ahead of our competitors on color pages and most importantly, pages remain the best source of our double-digit color annuity growth." The company sees its first-quarter profit in the range of 25 cents to 28 cents a share. Analysts on average estimate the profit at 27 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates.
