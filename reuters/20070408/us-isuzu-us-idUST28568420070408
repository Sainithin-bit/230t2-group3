 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japanese truck maker Isuzu Motors Ltd ( 7202.T ) will build its new U.S. mid-size truck plant in Alabama, with the factory set to come on line by 2010, the Nikkei business daily reported on Monday. 

 After years of restructuring, Isuzu is seeking to reestablish a production base in the United States as it hopes to offset stagnating domestic demand with overseas growth. It pulled out of joint vehicle production venture with Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd ( 7270.T ) in 2002. The new plant will build trucks with a payload capacity of four tonnes or more and initial annual production capacity will be 5,000 units, the paper said. The truck platforms and engines will be exported from Japan and assembled at the plant, it added.
