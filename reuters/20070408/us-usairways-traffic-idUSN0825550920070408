 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - US Airways Group ( LCC.N ) said on Sunday it expects to post a "slight profit" for the first quarter even as revenue was hurt and costs were increased due to weather and reservation systems problems during the period. 

 The company said first-quarter problems included a difficult reservation system change in early March and significant ice storms around Valentine's Day and St. Patrick's day that led to major disruptions in its Philadelphia hub. "As a result, for the second straight month we experienced a negative impact on revenue, passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM) and cost per available seat mile (CASM)," US Airways said in a statement issued late on Friday. "Despite the disruption we still project a slight profit (excluding special items) for the first quarter," it said. It said revenue passenger miles for March were up 0.2 percent to 5.6 billion compares with March 2006. The airline said its passenger load factor for March was 82 percent, up from 81 percent a year ago while its capacity was down 0.9 percent from March 2006.
