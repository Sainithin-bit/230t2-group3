 PHILADELPHIA  (Reuters) - Citigroup ( C.N ) is in talks to buy Old Lane, a hedge fund run by former Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) executive Vikram Pandit, for more than $600 million, according to The Wall Street Journal. 

 Pandit, who ran Morgan Stanley's institutional securities business until 2005, would become chief executive of Citigroup's alternative investments division, the newspaper said in its online edition. He also could become a candidate to eventually succeed Citigroup Chief Executive Charles Prince, the newspaper said. Citigroup and Old Lane could not be immediately reached for comment.
