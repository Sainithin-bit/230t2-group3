 LONDON  (Reuters) - Brewing giant SABMiller ( SAB.L ) ( SABJ.J ) is plotting to acquire rival Scottish & Newcastle SCTN.L in a 6.5-billion-pounds ($12.8 billion) deal, a paper said on Sunday. 

 The maker of Miller Lite and Peroni could make a bid of around 712 pence a share for S&N within days, the Sunday Express quoted sources close to the company as saying. It would also seek to sell on -- to spirits group Diageo ( DGE.L ) -- the UK arm that makes Britain's biggest selling lager Foster's, John Smith's bitter and Strongbow cider as well as its French business to satisfy industry watchdogs, the report said.
