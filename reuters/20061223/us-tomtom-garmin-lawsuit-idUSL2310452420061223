 AMSTERDAM, Dec 23 - Dutch navigation systems company TomTom ( TOM2.AS ) said on Saturday it had won a U.S. lawsuit brought by its main rival Garmin ( GRMN.O ) of the United States. 

 TomTom, which is the world's biggest producer of portable navigation devices for cars, said Garmin had not been able to substantiate any of its claims. "The decision finds that all five Garmin patents asserted against TomTom in the lawsuit are either invalid or not infringed by TomTom's popular line of navigation products," it said in a statement. The summary judgment from the United States Western District Court of Wisconsin ends one legal battle with Garmin Corp. and Garmin Ltd. Still pending is a complaint filed in August at the Eastern Texas U.S. District Court in which Garmin says TomTom is infringing on a patent for a "portable navigation system and device with audible turn instructions" and demanded that TomTom stop production and marketing of devices using the technology. A TomTom spokesman said the Texas lawsuit replaced one of the five infringement lawsuits brought in February by Garmin. TomTom believes the Texas case is without merit. Garmin was not immediately available to comment. TomTom is a leading seller of navigation devices in Europe, and is aiming to expand its sales in the United States, where Garmin has established itself as a provider of navigation devices and products. TomTom's share of the European market for portable, dedicated navigation devices -- estimated at 8 million units this year -- was above 50 percent in September. In the United States, where the market for standalone car navigation devices is four times smaller than in Europe, it had a 20 percent market share -- second after Garmin. Both TomTom and Garmin rely heavily on software technology for its computerised devices, which use satellite signals and software to guide users to destinations. "Garmin has spent considerable amounts of money and manpower to try and stop TomTom making inroads into the U.S. market," TomTom Chief Executive officer Harold Goddijn said in a statement. "The net result is that many of their claims were invalidated. We are hopeful that Garmin will return to competing in the marketplace instead of wasting resources on litigation," Goddijn added.
