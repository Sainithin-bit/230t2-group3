 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Virgin America Inc., a low-cost 
airline with a name made famous by British entrepreneur Richard 
Branson, expects the U.S. government to reject its application 
to start flying, a spokeswoman said. 

  The company announced earlier on Friday that it had 
completed the last formal step in the U.S. Federal Aviation 
Administration's airline certification review and only needed 
approval from the Department of Transportation.  The spokeswoman declined to elaborate, but Virgin America 
has faced opposition from U.S. carriers such as Continental 
Airlines CAL.N who argue that Branson's Virgin Group VA.UL 
effectively controls the airline in violation of U.S. law.  The law prohibits a foreign equity stake of more than 25 
percent in a U.S. airline.  British-based Virgin Group, which has stakes in airlines in 
Europe, Australia and Nigeria, holds a 25 percent stake in the 
company, lends the airline its brand and has promised to 
provide financing.  Virgin America says it is controlled by U.S. citizens and 
conforms with U.S. law and that rival airlines are using the 
foreign control argument to limit competition.  The airline said earlier that it planned to enter the 
market armed with $177.3 million in start-up capital.  Much of that financing came from VAI Partners LLC, an 
investment group funded by private equity firms Black Canyon 
Capital and Cyrus Capital Partners.  The company had 33 Airbus planes on order and was planning 
to start operation with just two to four aircraft once it was 
allowed to fly.  The airline intended to first fly between San Francisco and 
New York, hoping to grow to 20 routes in two years.
