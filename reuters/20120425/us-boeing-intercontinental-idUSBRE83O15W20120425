 (Reuters) - Boeing Co ( BA.N ) said on Wednesday it has delivered a 747-8 Intercontinental passenger plane to Deutsche Lufthansa AG ( LHAG.DE ), the first delivery of the airplane to an airline customer. 
 The Intercontinental is an upgraded, elongated version of the classic 747. The 747-8 is the biggest commercial airplane Boeing makes. The company delivered an Intercontinental to an unidentified VIP customer earlier this year. Boeing also makes a cargo version of the 747-8. (Reporting By Kyle Peterson; Editing by Gerald E.
