 TORONTO  (Reuters) - Biovail Corp BVF.TO BVF.N said on Tuesday that it settled a U.S. securities class action suit that stretched back more than 4 years. 

 Canada's biggest publicly traded drugmaker said the total settlement is $138 million, but it estimated it would pay about $85 million after resolution of all insurance claims. ($1=$1.01 Canadian) (Reporting by Scott Anderson; Editing by  Bernadette Baum )
