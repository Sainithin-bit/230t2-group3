 VIENNA  (Reuters) - Global growth is still robust despite a slowdown in the United States, a presentation by European Central Bank Governing Council member Klaus Liebscher said on Tuesday. 

 "Despite (the) slowdown in the USA, (there is) still robust growth of the global economy," one of the slides said. The presentation was handed out at an Austrian central bank news conference which Liebscher missed because of illness. "The impact of the U.S. dollar's depreciation (is) moderated by Austria's trade structure," another slide said. "(The) foreign exchange rate dampens the oil price development," a third slide said.
