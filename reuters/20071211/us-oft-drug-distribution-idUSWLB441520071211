 LONDON  (Reuters) - Britain's consumer affairs watchdog warned on Tuesday that deals such as Pfizer's ( PFE.N ) exclusive UK distribution agreement with Alliance Boots could cost the state-funded health service hundreds of millions of pounds. 

 The Office of Fair Trading urged the government to make changes to its drug pricing agreement with pharmaceutical companies to ensure that medicine costs for the National Health Service did not rise as a result of changes in distribution.
