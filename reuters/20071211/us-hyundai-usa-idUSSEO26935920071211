 SEOUL  (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor Co ( 005380.KS ) said on Tuesday it has no plans to cut production at its U.S. plant in 2008, after a local newspaper reported South Korea's top auto maker was looking at reducing output amid slower sales. 

 The Maeil Business Newspaper reported earlier on Tuesday Hyundai might cut output at its factory in Alabama, which has a capacity of 300,000 units a year, as U.S. sales were sluggish amid the fallout from the subprime mortgage sector. "We do not have plans to halt production at the U.S. plant next year and will not cut output unless we face unexpected problems, such as more serious problems coming from the subprime sector," Hyundai spokesman Jake Jang said. In the fourth quarter, Hyundai, the world's No.6 auto maker by sales volume with affiliate Kia Motors Corp ( 000270.KS ), decided to stop operations for 10 days at the plant as overall auto demand in the United States has been hit by a slowdown in the world's top economy. Hyundai is upbeat about U.S. sales next year, having a target of 10 percent growth as it plans to roll out new models such as its premium sedan Genesis there and the NF Sonata Transform, a revamped version of its flagship mid-sized sedan, Jang said. The company plans to release the Genesis, which is produced in South Korea, in June 2008 and will produce the new Sonata from January. Hyundai sold 420,522 cars and light trucks in the United States in the first 11 months of 2007, up 0.6 percent from the same period a year earlier. Analysts have said Hyundai's overseas units are crucial to the company's growth as they help reduce the impact from a firmer won currency and potential conflicts with its union. Hyundai, which has factories in the United States, China, India and Turkey, is adding another one in the Czech Republic. Shares in Hyundai were up 0.41 percent to 73,200 won as of 0241 GMT, compared with a 0.30 percent rise in the broader market  .KS11 . (Reporting by Cheon Jong-woo; Editing by Sei Chong)
