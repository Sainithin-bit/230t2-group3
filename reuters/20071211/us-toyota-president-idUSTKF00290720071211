 TOYOTA CITY, Japan  (Reuters) - The head of Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ) said on Tuesday that he expected more than $2.7 billion in annual cost savings starting next year from the automaker's latest cost-cutting plan. 

 "We would expect to exceed what we've done under the previous plan," President Katsuaki Watanabe, told Reuters in an interview at the company's headquarters in Toyota City. That amount should grow every year along with a rise in sales volume, he said, as the cost reductions would be made on a per-vehicle basis. Since 2005, Toyota has been working on a new cost-saving strategy dubbed "VI" for Value Innovation, which seeks to lump some of the tens of thousands of components in a car into modules and systems. The first car to incorporate the new scheme is due out early next year, with the remodeled flagship Crown sedan. Toyota has given scant details on the program's target, saying only that it expects the impact to be faster and bigger than a previous plan that cut the price of individual parts. That plan, called CCC21 (Construction of Cost Competitiveness in the 21st Century) and led by Watanabe as purchasing chief, shaved $9 billion off costs over five years. (Reporting by  Chang-Ran Kim )
