 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve is actively considering all of the tools it has available to address liquidity issues, a Fed source said on Tuesday. 

 Fed officials are not unaware that funding pressures have gotten worse, the source said. Although the Fed statement issued on Tuesday does not mention liquidity measures, tools to address liquidity issues remain under active consideration, the source added. (Reporting by  Mark Felsenthal )
