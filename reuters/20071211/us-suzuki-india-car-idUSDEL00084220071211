 NEW DELHI  (Reuters) - Suzuki Motor Corp's ( 7269.T ) new world car will be built in India and aimed at European markets, its chief executive said on Tuesday. 

 Maruti Suzuki India Ltd ( MRTI.BO ), in which Suzuki owns 54.2 percent, will unveil the car at the upcoming Auto Expo in New Delhi in January and launch the car after autumn 2008, Osamu Suzuki said at a news conference. Earlier, Suzuki said India will become a production hub for its global operations. Maruti, which has about half the local car market, for the first time sold more cars in India than its parent did in Japan during the first half of this fiscal year.
