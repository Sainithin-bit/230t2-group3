 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Top U.S. phone company AT&T Inc ( T.N ) said on Tuesday it would raise its quarterly dividend to 40 cents a share from 35.5 cents and would buy back 400 million shares under a new repurchase program. 

 AT&T said it would now pay an annual dividend of $1.60 a share, compared with a previous $1.42, the largest increase in the company's history. It said it expects to complete the newly authorized share repurchases by the end of 2009. (Reporting by  Ritsuko Ando ; editing by John Wallace)
