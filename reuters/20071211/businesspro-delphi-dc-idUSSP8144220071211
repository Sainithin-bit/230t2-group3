 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bankrupt auto-parts maker Delphi Corp. 
DPHIQ.PK said on Monday that it had signed a master sale and 
purchase agreement with Steering Solutions Corp., a unit of 
Platinum Equity LLC, for the sale of its global steering and 
halfshaft businesses. 

  Delphi also entered into a transaction facilitation 
agreement for its former parent, General Motors Corp ( GM.N ), to 
make certain commitments to Delphi in connection with the sale.  Delphi filed a motion with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in 
Manhattan asking the court to approve the master purchase and 
sale agreement as well as the GM transaction, and requested a 
bidding procedures hearing on December 20.  Under U.S. bankruptcy rules, parties interested in buying 
the businesses would be allowed to submit a binding bid. If 
Delphi receives qualified bids it would hold an auction and 
award the steering and halfshaft business to the best bid.  Delphi expects a final sale hearing in February.  The final sale of Delphi's global steering and halfshaft 
businesses and the transaction facilitation agreement are 
subject to the approval of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court.  (Reporting by  Ilaina Jonas , editing by Jacqueline Wong)
