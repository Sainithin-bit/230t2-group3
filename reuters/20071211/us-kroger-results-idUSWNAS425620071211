 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Kroger Co ( KR.N ), the largest U.S. grocery chain, posted higher quarterly profit on Tuesday on solid sales growth. 

 The company said profit was $253.8 million, or 37 cents a share, in the fiscal third quarter ended November 10, compared with $214.7 million, or 30 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had forecast 35 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Kroger has been remodeling stores and promoting items like fresh produce as it battles pressure from rivals ranging from Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ), to dollar stores, to warehouse clubs and natural foods chains.
