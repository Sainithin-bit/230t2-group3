 LONDON  (Reuters) - Xstrata Plc XTA.L, the world's sixth-biggest mining company, is open to talks with potential suitors, including Vale ( VALE5.SA ) and Anglo American ( AAL.L ), the Financial Times said on Tuesday. 

 Xstrata shares were among the top gainers on the FTSE 100  .FTSE , surging as much as 4.6 percent before paring gains to 2.8 percent at 37.58 pence by 8:10 a.m., compared to a 0.8 percent dip in the UK mining index .FTNMX1770. Anglo American slipped 1.0 percent to 3,358 pence. The newspaper, citing people close to the situation, said Xstrata Chief Executive Mick Davis had asked the firm's advisers, Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ) and JP Morgan Cazenove, to take seriously any interested parties. "We're not commenting on any of this speculation," Xstrata spokeswoman Claire Divver said. The FT said Davis's stance had prompted Vale, the Brazilian miner formerly known as CVRD, to hire Lehman Brothers LEH.N and Merrill Lynch MER.N to consider the merits of a potential bid. Vale said it had not bid for any firm but was examining opportunities as the mining industry consolidates. "As one of the global leaders in this industry, Vale regularly analyses and evaluates the attractiveness of various investment opportunities and discusses them with investment banks, financial advisers and other specialists," it said in a statement. "However, there has not been any decision by the administration, nor any offer has been made by Vale to acquire any company." The Financial Times said Davis also recently met Anglo Chief Executive Cynthia Carroll at the London headquarters of UBS ( UBSN.VX ), Anglo's adviser, though it added that no serious proposal was discussed. Anglo declined to comment. "It's somewhat silly season at the moment in terms of the amount of speculation, but we're not going to give any comment whatsoever about our executives' diaries," spokesman James Wyatt-Tilby said. Xstrata held an investor conference last week, highlighting its growth prospects in copper, coal and nickel. At the conference, Davis said BHP Billiton's ( BHP.AX )( BLT.L ) move to acquire rival Rio Tinto ( RIO.L )( RIO.AX ) was likely to lead to another wave of mergers in the sector. "Whether that transaction goes through or not, time will tell. It certainly, I think, has created another new dynamic and momentum for consolidation in the industry," he said. "I think we are the most perfectly positioned company in the industry, the company which is going to benefit from consolidation in any way that it actually transpires."
