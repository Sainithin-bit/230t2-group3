 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc ( MRK.N ) has not provided evidence that consumers can adequately understand the instructions on a proposed over-the-counter version of cholesterol drug Mevacor, a U.S. drug reviewer said in documents released on Tuesday. 

 The review is not final and other information will be considered, including input from an advisory panel of outside experts that meets on Thursday, Food and Drug Administration reviewer Eileen Craig wrote. Merck submitted studies designed to show that patients could decide for themselves if they were appropriate candidates for Mevacor and could use the drug properly. But the studies "have not convinced this reviewer that there is adequate consumer comprehension of the proposed product label to ensure safe and effective use of this product," Craig said in a summary prepared for the advisory panel. Merck spokesman Ronald Rogers said Craig's statement was just one of multiple reviews and opinions from FDA staff. The FDA released 537 pages of documents that were distributed to advisory panel members for the Mevacor meeting. "When you look at the comprehensive document, we are pleased with the balanced nature of the reviews," Rogers said. Merck is making its third bid to win FDA approval to switch Mevacor from prescription-only status to over-the-counter sales. The company is confident that data it will present to the advisory panel "will demonstrate consumers can safely and effectively use Mevacor" in the over-the-counter setting, Rogers added.
