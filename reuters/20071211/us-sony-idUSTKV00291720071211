 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Sony Corp's ( 6758.T ) consumer electronics business in the key U.S. market has not been affected by the shaky economy, and it is on track to hit a 5 percent operating margin for the year ending March 31, Chief Executive Howard Stringer said on Tuesday. 

 The margin target has been considered the most visible indicator of success for turnaround efforts by Stringer, who took the helm of Sony in 2005. The shaky economy "has not affected electronics in the U.S. We are holding up," said Stringer, the first non-Japanese to run the Tokyo-based electronics and entertainment conglomerate.
