 ZURICH  (Reuters) - Swiss Re remains committed to its Financial Services unit, which was the source of a massive subprime writedown last month, the world's largest reinsurer said on Tuesday. 

 "Swiss Re remains committed to its Financial Services business," the company said in slides prepared for a presentation at an investor day in London. Swiss Re stunned markets on November 19 with a 1.2 billion Swiss franc ($1.06 billion) writedown related to credit default swaps. Its shares have slid 12 percent since then.
