 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - More than two-thirds of Americans say concern over product safety has hurt their confidence in Chinese goods, according to a poll published on Monday. 

 The Committee of 100, a group of prominent Chinese Americans, said scares about lead in Chinese-made toys and other product safety troubles may also account for a 7 percent drop in China's image since it last polled Americans in 2005. Fifty-two percent of respondents in the telephone survey of 1,200 U.S. adults gave China overall a favorable rating, and 45 percent had an unfavorable view, the committee said. A related Committee of 100 poll involving face-to-face interviews with 4,104 adults in China found that 60 percent of respondents had a favorable impression of the United States, while 26 percent held an unfavorable view. On trade, 72 percent of U.S. citizens said they "strongly agree" or "somewhat agree" that trading with China benefits the United States, while 27 percent "strongly disagree" or "somewhat disagree." In contrast, 82 percent of Chinese polled "strongly agree" or "somewhat agree" that trade with the United States benefits China, while only 7 percent "strongly disagree" or "somewhat disagree," the committee said. The poll found that about two thirds of Americans fear China's growing economic power, with 25 percent saying China represented a "serious threat" and 40 percent saying it posed a "potential threat." In contrast to the general public, 94 percent of Chinese business leaders polled by the Committee of 100 expressed a favorable opinion of the United States and only 6 percent held an unfavorable view. U.S. business leaders surveyed showed 54 percent held a favorable view of China, while 41 percent had an unfavorable impression, the committee said. (Reporting by  Paul Eckert )
