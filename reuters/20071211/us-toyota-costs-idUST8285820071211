 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ) introduced a new cost-cutting scheme in 2005, dubbed "VI" for Value Innovation, to look for ways to bring components together at the design stage to shave costs. 

 The first vehicle it is producing under the new scheme is a remodeling of its flagship Crown sedan due out early next year. Under the previous plan, called CCC21 (Construction of Cost Competitiveness in the 21st Century) and begun in July 2000, Toyota reduced purchasing costs for individual components. Following is a table illustrating Toyota's recent track record in cost reduction. Benefits of cost-cutting appear when vehicles are fully remodeled, and fluctuate from year to year depending on the cars' sales volume. TOYOTA *Cost cut contribution Cost cut per Operating Avg $ to operating profit vehicle sold margin rate 2006/07 100 bln yen 11,732 yen 9.3 pct 117 yen 2005/06 130 bln yen 16,303 yen 8.9 pct 113 yen 2004/05 160 bln yen 21,600 yen 9.0 pct 108 yen 2003/04 230 bln yen 34,230 yen 9.6 pct 113 yen 2002/03 300 bln yen 48,031 yen 8.5 pct 122 yen 2001/02 260 bln yen 44,952 yen 7.4 pct 125 yen 2000/01 150 bln yen 27,139 yen 6.5 pct 110 yen 1999/00 190 bln yen 36,658 yen 6.0 pct 111 yen *Amount is net of fluctuations in raw materials costs.
