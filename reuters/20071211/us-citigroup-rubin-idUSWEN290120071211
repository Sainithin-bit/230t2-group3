 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Outgoing Citigroup Inc ( C.N ) chairman Robert Rubin said on Tuesday it was pretty likely the board would be expanded after the company announced that Vikram Pandit was named chief executive and Win Bischoff would serve as nonexecutive chairman. 

 Rubin took over as chairman after the company said November 4 that Charles Prince was resigning as chairman and chief executive. Rubin will return to his previous duties as a member of the Citigroup board of directors and chairman of its executive committee. Rubin said on a conference call after the announcements that he was unaware of anyone on the current board who planned to leave.
