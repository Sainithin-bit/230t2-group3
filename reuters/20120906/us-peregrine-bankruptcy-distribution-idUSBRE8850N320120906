 (Reuters) - Peregrine Financial Group's bankruptcy trustee is seeking court approval to distribute $123 million to former customers of the futures brokerage, the first they would see of their funds since Peregrine's collapse in mid-July. 
 The trustee, Ira Bodenstein, has about $181 million on hand, he said in a court filing late Wednesday. The earliest the distribution could take place would be September 28, according to the filing. Peregrine filed for bankruptcy protection on July 10, a day after its CEO attempted suicide and confessed to a long-running fraud. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has pegged the amount of missing customer funds at more than $200 million.
