 BEIJING  (Reuters) - Citigroup still hopes to prevail in a protracted battle for a stake in Chinese lender Guangdong Development Bank, a senior official at the U.S. bank said on Friday. 

 "We continue to be hopeful that we will reach a positive conclusion with our friends at Guangdong Development Bank and the authorities of Guangdong province in this discussion period," Citigroup Senior Vice Chairman William Rhodes told reporters. Citigroup ( C.N ) has been locked in a year-long tussle with French bank Societe Generale ( SOGN.PA ) for the right to buy into Guangdong Development Bank, which is  in poor financial shape but has a network of more than 500 branches across China.
