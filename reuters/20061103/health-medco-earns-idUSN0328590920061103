  By  Lewis Krauskopf NEW YORK  Nov 3 (Reuters) - Medco Health Solutions Inc.
MHS.N on Friday said quarterly profit rose 18 percent as the
pharmacy benefit manager dispensed more mail-delivery
prescriptions, and forecast 2006 profit ahead of estimates.  Executives also said they saw no harm to Medco coming from
either a recent move by Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) to sell
some generic drugs for $4 per prescription, or a potential
legal settlement that could lower an industry benchmark price.  Medco's solid results come during a volatile time for
pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, after rival Caremark Rx
Inc.'s CMX.N agreement on Wednesday to be acquired by the No.
2 U.S. drugstore chain CVS Corp. ( CVS.N ) for nearly $21 billion
-- valuing Caremark without a premium to its shares.  Medco shares opened up as much as 4.1 percent, but then
reversed their gains and traded off 2.4 percent.  "Clearly, the CVS-Caremark merger is the big event in this
space," said William Blair & Co. analyst John Kreger, who
follows the PBM industry. "It dominates any of the nuances we
are seeing in quarterly earnings."  Pharmacy benefit managers administer prescription drug
benefits for employers and health plans, brokering deals in
part by buying medicines in bulk from manufacturers. They
operate large pharmacies that deliver prescriptions by mail.  Third-quarter net income rose to $186 million, or 62 cents
per share, from $157 million, or 53 cents per share, a year
earlier.  Excluding 9 cents in amortization of intangible assets,
earnings were 71 cents per share. Medco also said it got a
2-cent-per-share tax benefit in the quarter.  Analysts, on average, expected 69 cents per share,
according to Reuters Estimates.  Net revenue rose 12.2 percent to nearly $10.5 billion.  The Franklin Lakes, New Jersey-based company dispensed 22.3
million prescriptions through its mail-order pharmacies, up 4.2
percent. Total prescription volume, adjusting for the
difference in supply days between mail and retail, increased
3.3 percent to 179.2 million.  Medco said its rate of dispensing generic drugs -- an
important profit generator -- is at record levels because of
the availability of generic versions of blockbuster medicines
such as the anti-depressant Zoloft and cholesterol treatment
Zocor.  The Caremark-CVS deal further rattled investors, who had
been worried about potential pricing pressure from the Wal-Mart
move and the possible change to the price benchmark.  Medco CEO David Snow told analysts on a conference call he
did not see any harm to business coming from Wal-Mart's move,
calling it a strategy designed to bring customers into the
retail giant's stores.  Snow also said a potential legal settlement that could
lower the price benchmark -- known as Average Wholesale Price
-- would not have a material effect on profitability. He said
Medco's contracts with its clients lock in the financial
arrangements in the event of a change to the benchmark.  Snow said the company was still doing its "homework" on the
Caremark-CVS deal, but that Medco is "the best asset by far in
the space."  "Clearly, this whole thing will be watched," Snow said. "I
think, frankly, a company like Medco is in a very good position
relative to these dynamics, and it will create opportunity in
many different ways."  Medco forecast 2006 earnings per share of $2.33 to $2.36,
compared with its prior view of $2.26 to $2.35, excluding a
charge from a legal settlement.  Excluding the legal charge and amortization in intangible
assets, Medco forecast 2006 earnings of $2.69 to $2.72 per
share. Analysts expected $2.67.  Medco projected 2007 GAAP earnings of $2.76 to $2.83 per
share, or $3.12 to $3.19 excluding the amortization of
intangibles. Analysts expect $3.13.  Medco shares were off $1.21 at $50.19 in noon trade on the
New York Stock Exchange, where they had been as high $53.51.
The shares are down around 9 percent so far this year.
