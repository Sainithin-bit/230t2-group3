 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Kevin Martin said on Friday progress had slowed on reaching a compromise to approve AT&T Inc.'s ( T.N ) $81.3 billion acquisition of BellSouth Corp. BLS.N after a vote was postponed for the third time. 

 "We have made progress," Martin told reporters after the FCC's public meeting. "I always try to work with my colleagues, but I think we're still pretty far apart and I think the progress has slowed." But he also left open the door to getting a ruling from the FCC's general counsel that would allow Republican Commissioner Robert McDowell to vote on the transaction. So far McDowell has sat out because he had previously worked for a group that represents AT&T and BellSouth competitors. "I've been focused up until now, up until today, on just trying to make sure that we work through all the different alternatives that any of the commissioners have proposed," Martin said. "We're going to continue to end up doing that; but we do have to take a step back and try to figure where we should end up going from here," Martin said. McDowell quickly left the FCC meeting after it ended without taking questions. Commissioners often linger to chat with staff, industry representatives and reporters. On Thursday, Martin delayed a vote scheduled for Friday after he and fellow Republican Commissioner Deborah Taylor Tate were unable to reach a deal on possible conditions with the two Democrat commissioners, Jonathan Adelstein and Michael Copps. The four have been haggling over a host of conditions that could be attached to their approval. They include terms for high-speed Internet service and wholesale rates for rivals to lease access to AT&T's network. Competitors have pressed for more conditions than AT&T initially said it could accept, including that the company sell some wireless airwaves that BellSouth owns; and some Internet content providers have demanded that the FCC bar AT&T from charging them more for priority service to customers. The acquisition of BellSouth, the No. 3 U.S. local telephone carrier, would solidify AT&T's position as the largest U.S. telecommunications provider and bring their Cingular Wireless joint venture under one roof. The FCC approval, which analysts expect ultimately to happen, is the last regulatory hurdle for the deal. The head of Comptel -- which represents competitors of AT&T and BellSouth and was McDowell's previous employer -- said should the FCC be unable to reach consensus, an administrative law judge rule should rule on whether the deal would be in the public interest. "Clearly, the commission, at least for the moment, is having difficulty ascertaining what the public interest benefits are and what the appropriate conditions would be," Earl Comstock, Comptel's chief executive officer, told Reuters. AT&T spokesman Michael Balmoris said that was not a credible solution. "We agree with Chairman Martin's assessment," he said. As for McDowell, he might find it hard to avoid voting if cleared to do so. McDowell said during his Senate confirmation hearing that he would rely on the FCC counsel's advice and opinions when potential conflict of interest issues emerged. "We suspect Chairman Martin would still prefer a bipartisan deal, given the expected delay, controversy, and uncertainties involved in activating that commissioner," Stifel, Nicolaus & Co. analysts said in a note to clients. AT&T's shares were down 39 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $33.63 on the New York Stock Exchange in late afternoon trading while BellSouth shares fell 61 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $44.04.
