 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Complaints of engine compartment fires in Ford ( F.N ) Escape sport utility vehicles has prompted an investigation by U.S. safety regulators, the government said on Friday. 

 The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration preliminary review covers more than 600,000 vehicles from the 2001-03 model years and includes the Mazda Tribute, which has some similar design features. No complaints were received about the Mazda vehicle. The agency said it received eight complaints of fires in Escape SUVs that started in the engine compartment at or near a device that monitors the vehicle's anti-lock brakes. Five of the fires apparently occurred when the vehicle was turned off, NHTSA said. Two other complaints involved smoke or melted electrical components and wiring near the brake system, the agency said. There have been no reports of injuries. Regulators included the Mazda Tribute 2001-03 model years in the review because of the design similarities. Ford officials could not be immediately reached for comment.
