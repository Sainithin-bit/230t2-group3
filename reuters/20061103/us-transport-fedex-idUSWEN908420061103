 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - FedEx Corp. ( FDX.N ) said on Friday it will increase rates for express delivery unit FedEx Express by 3.5 percent, effective January 1, 2007. 

 FedEx shares rose more than 1 percent in early trade. The Memphis, Tennessee-based package delivery company said it will raise its standard list rate by 5.5 percent, but the effect of the increase will be offset by a 2 percentage point reduction in its fuel surcharge. FedEx introduced an identical rate increase a year ago for calendar year 2006. "FedEx's 3.5 percent effective list rate increase at its flagship Express division is a good sign that domestic parcel pricing remains firm and rational," Morgan Stanley analyst William Greene wrote in a research note. Morgan Stanley has an "overweight" rating on FedEx with a target price of $135. Greene added that FedEx's move indicates that the company expects its main rival, Atlanta-based United Parcel Service Inc ( UPS.N ), will follow suit a similar price increase. The company said its fuel surcharge will also be levied on some transportation-based surcharges such as its residential and delivery area charge for all domestic shipments, and for U.S. export and import express shipments paid for by U.S. customers. Most transportation companies in the United States have passed on higher fuel prices to their customers through surcharges. FedEx said it will also introduce rate increases for its ground package delivery unit in 2007 and will announce those changes later this year. In trade on the New York Stock Exchange, FedEx shares were up $1.16 at $113.25.
