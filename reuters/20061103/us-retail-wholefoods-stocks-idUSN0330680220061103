 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Whole Foods Market Inc. WFMI.O shares posted their biggest percentage drop ever on Friday, a day after the No. 1 natural and organic grocer said it was pressured by traditional grocers adopting the fresh produce and prepared meals that are a cornerstone of its strategy. 

 On Thursday, Whole Foods said it expected sales at stores open at least a year to rise 6 percent to 8 percent in 2007, far below the double-digit increases the retailer has posted for the last three years. Same-store sales rose just 6.8 percent in the first five weeks of the fiscal year that started in late September -- that is half the growth posted in the same period a year ago. Whole Foods also said total sales should rise 13 percent to 17 percent in the current fiscal year. It previously called for 15 percent to 20 percent growth. HSBC, which has an "underweight" rating on Whole Foods, slashed its price target on the shares to $33 from $58 and Bank of America downgraded the shares to "neutral" from "buy." "Competition is tougher. No question about it," Chief Executive John Mackey said on a conference call on Thursday. Whole Foods fell as much as 24.2 percent to $45.56 before recovering slightly to $46.21 in Friday afternoon trading. It was the most heavily traded company on the Nasdaq. It was the largest percentage drop since Austin-based Whole Foods went public in January 1992 and pushed the shares to their lowest level since February 2005, adjusting for a stock split. Shares of grocery distributor United Natural Foods Inc. ( UNFI.O ), which counts Whole Foods as its biggest customer, was off 3.8 percent to $33.01. Whole Foods rival Wild Oats Markets Inc. OATS.O fell 6.1 percent to $15.90. PRESSURE, HEADHUNTERS Whole Foods said it is feeling pressure from niche retailers, such as privately-held Trader Joe's and Wegmans, which are known for good customer service and prepared foods. At the same time, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) and traditional grocers such as Safeway Inc. ( SWY.N ) have added more organic fare. "From copying many aspects in the design of our stores to selling more organic foods of all types, other supermarkets are studying and emulating us in dozens of different ways in their attempt to compete more aggressively against us," Mackey said in a letter posted on his blog. Several Whole Foods executives have been approached by headhunters, leading the company to raise its salary cap to keep them from jumping to rival companies. "Raising the salary cap to 19 times the average pay has become necessary to help ensure the retention of our key leadership," Mackey wrote. He cut his own salary to $1. HSBC analyst Mark Husson said he did not see why Whole Foods should trade at a premium to quality long-term growth retailers. "Super high premiums for concept stocks are only sustainable, we believe, while they are still 'working' or delivering vastly superior returns," Husson wrote in a note to clients. "When reality catches up and growth slows, the entire discounted future tends to collapse in -- and so do the multiples." As of Thursday, Whole Foods shares traded at about 36.4 times next year's expected profit -- a sharp premium to No. 1 grocer Kroger Co. ( KR.N ), which trades at just 14 times expected earnings, and No. 1 drugstore Walgreen, which trades at 18.5 times its expected profit.
