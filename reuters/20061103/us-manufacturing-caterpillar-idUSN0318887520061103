 LAFAYETTE, Indiana  (Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc. ( CAT.N ) on Friday reiterated a 2007 outlook underlining slowing demand for diesel engines and heavy equipment for the housing industry, but it painted a rosier picture further out. 

 The company, which gave the outlook at an analysts' meeting here, said it expects 2007 earnings in the range of $5.18 to $5.70 a share. Analysts were expecting $5.61 a share on average, according to Reuters Estimates. "2007 will be a more challenging year than we've had in the last couple because we're going to hit turbulent waters," Caterpillar Chief Executive Jim Owens said at the meeting. "These are big corrections" in on-highway engines and residential construction, he added, noting that they will represent areas of "acute weakness" for the U.S. economy. Combined, Caterpillar's on-highway diesel engine and construction equipment businesses account for roughly $5 billion in annual sales; they will be off 35 percent to 40 percent next year, Owens said. Down the road, Peoria, Illinois-based Caterpillar's outlook was more positive. The company set a sales growth target of up to 46 percent by 2010 and forecast improvement across most of its regions worldwide. Caterpillar and other old line manufacturers have been dogged by the slowing U.S. economy. Higher raw material and energy costs have dampened demand in many markets, including housing. Shares of the maker of heavy earth-moving machinery were little changed on Friday, last off 6 cents at $60.50 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Longbow Research analyst Eli Lustgarten, who was present at the meeting, said that "2007 is clearly a year of transition." The company said it still sees 2007 sales flat to up about 5 percent, in a range of $41 billion to $43 billion. That compares with analysts' expectations for $40.38 billion and the company's expected 2006 sales of $41 billion. Caterpillar backed its forecast for a 2006 profit in the range of $5.05 to $5.30 a share. ROSIER LONG-TERM VIEW Company executives said they see "plausible" sales in 2010 of $45 billion to $60 billion, assuming a compound annual growth rate of 6 percent beginning in 2008. The company also has a goal for 2010 earnings of $8.13 to $10.05 a share, assuming a 15 percent to 20 percent compound annual growth rate through that year. Caterpillar said it sees global gross domestic product growth next year of 3.5 percent. For the 2006 to 2010 period, it expects global GDP to be up 3.4 percent, compared with 2.8 percent growth from 2000 to 2005. In that same four-year period, Caterpillar sees GDP growth expanding in the North America, Europe, Latin America and Japan regions, compared with the period ending in 2005. However, it sees growth slowing slightly in Asia Pacific, excluding Japan. Next year, Owens said Caterpillar expects industry sales to U.S. residential home builders to "fall more than 30 percent." The head of Caterpillar's engine business, Douglas Oberhelman, told analysts he sees demand for the company's diesel engines next year stalling in most sectors. He said industrywide growth is slowing in the oil, maritime and industrial sectors. It is unchanged in electric power and is falling in the North American heavy-duty and medium-duty on-highway markets. Oberhelman said there will be layoffs at the company's Mossville, Illinois, plant when on-highway engine demand drops next year, with sales down more dramatically in the first half. He did not quantify the job cuts. "There are too many uncertainties in '07 to bank on results like '06," he said.
