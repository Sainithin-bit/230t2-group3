 NEW DELHI  (Reuters) - Intel Corp., the world's largest chip maker, is waiting for India to form its semiconductor policy before deciding on plans to begin manufacturing in the country, company officials said on Friday. 

 "We are eagerly awaiting the publication of the final set of regulations, and then we will take a decision," Intel Chairman Craig Barrett told reporters during a trip to New Delhi. India's government is expected to come out soon with guidelines to develop a microchip industry, including tax incentives. The company first confirmed in December last year its talks with the government about building a chip-making factory. Ramamurthy Sivakumar, the firm's South Asia managing director, said Intel had been repeatedly told a move was imminent. "We have heard that the cabinet is actively discussing it," he said. Intel is already spending more than $1 billion in India to strengthen its research and development and to invest in telecoms start-ups. Rival chip-maker Advanced Micro Devices Inc. said last November it planned to invest in the SemIndia consortium to build a chip-making factory in India.
