 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Elizabeth Arden Inc. ( RDEN.O ) posted a quarterly loss on Friday as it spent money to restructure its European operations and launch new perfumes, but the results were stronger than expected as it spent less on marketing than it had planned. 

 Despite strong sales growth and the smaller-than-expected quarterly loss, the company maintained its financial forecasts as it works on integrating brands it recently acquired at the same time that it prepares for the crucial holiday season. Chairman and Chief Executive E. Scott Beattie admitted during a conference call that the company is probably being somewhat conservative by not raising its forecast, and said it could revise the view in the second half of the fiscal year. Elizabeth Arden initially gave its fiscal year forecast in August, leading analysts to lower their expectations. The cosmetics and fragrance maker also said that its board authorized the repurchase of an additional $40 million of common stock. Shares of Elizabeth Arden, which said it feels good about the current retail environment, were up 3.2 percent at $17.57 after rising to $17.73 in morning Nasdaq trading. Elizabeth Arden posted a loss of $1.3 million, or 5 cents per share, for the fiscal first quarter ended September 30, compared with a profit of $895,000, or 3 cents per share, a year earlier. The loss was 2 cents per share excluding restructuring charges, blowing past Wall Street's average expectation for a loss of 27 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. "However, much of the upside appears to stem from a shift in promotional spending," CIBC analyst Joseph Altobello wrote in a note. He has a "sector performer" rating on the shares. Elizabeth Arden said it moved some $5 million to $6 million of its promotional spending from the first quarter into the current second quarter to reach holiday shoppers. It had to move some marketing for the new With Love ... Hilary Duff perfume into the current quarter due to timing issues with the production of a music video and commercial for the scent named after the teen actress and singer. Sales rose 12.1 percent to $254.8 million, driven by new brands such as With Love ... Hilary Duff, Danielle by Danielle Steel and fragrances it bought this summer. The sales fell short of analysts' average forecast of $258.8 million. New York-based Elizabeth Arden added designer fragrances such as Badgley Mischka to its lineup with the acquisition of the brand licenses and some assets of privately held Riviera Concepts Inc. Its other fragrances include scents named for celebrities Elizabeth Taylor and Britney Spears and men's colognes Daytona 500 and HUMMER. Elizabeth Arden said its new $95 Prevage eye treatment has been very successful. The product, which has been at U.S. and Canadian makeup counters for about two weeks, is also driving sales of the original $150 Prevage anti-aging face treatment. The company still expects to earn $1.10 per share to $1.20 per share this year, excluding any restructuring charges. Analysts, on average, expect a profit of $1.10 per share. Elizabeth Arden said it still expects fiscal 2007 sales to rise by about 15 percent to 18 percent to $1.10 billion to $1.13 billion. The forecast assumes no impact from foreign currency translation.
