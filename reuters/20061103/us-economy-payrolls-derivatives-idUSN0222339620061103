 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Traders are betting that U.S. employers added about 99,500 jobs in October according to the implied market forecast, in the fourth of five derivatives auctions, according to preliminary data from the firms holding the auction. 

 The results were slightly lower than the 102,000 jobs predicted in an auction held early Thursday. The U.S. Labor Department will issue the October payroll report on Friday at 8:30 a.m. EST. The derivatives auction on Thursday covered a wide range of expectations, with payrolls gains seen between 25,000 and 100,000, drawing about 39.3 percent of trader's bets. The latest median forecast of economists polled by Reuters predicted a 125,000-job increase in nonfarm payrolls in October following a gain of 51,000 gain in September. Investors use the auctions to hedge against unwanted surprises in the report. Traders also use the auctions to speculate on the outcome. Economic derivatives are offered by Goldman Sachs, interdealer broker ICAP and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange CME.N.
