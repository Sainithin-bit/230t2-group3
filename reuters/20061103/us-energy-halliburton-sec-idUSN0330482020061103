 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Halliburton Co. ( HAL.N ) said it will likely agree to regulators' request for more time to investigate allegations that the world's No. 2 oilfield services group was involved in a scheme that paid bribes to Nigerian officials. 

 The company said in its quarterly filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday that the SEC requested a so-called "tolling agreement" for its formal investigation. Such an agreement puts off the time when a statute of limitations goes into effect for an investigation. The regulators, as well as the U.S. Justice Department and Britain's Serious Fraud Office, are looking at whether a consortium, in which Halliburton's KBR unit had a 25 percent stake, made payments to secure construction work for a multibillion-dollar natural gas liquefaction complex in Nigeria. In 2004 Halliburton cut ties to Jack Stanley, former KBR chairman, over the alleged $180 million bribery scheme. Halliburton has said it has reason to believe that starting at least 10 years ago, members of the consortium planned payments to Nigerian officials. If the SEC and DOJ find the payments violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, Halliburton said it may face a suspension or debarment of its ability to contract with U.S. and foreign government agencies. During 2005, KBR and its affiliates had revenue of $6.6 billion from its government contracts work with the United States or state or local governments. Earlier this week, KBR set the terms of its planned initial public offering, which could raise up to $473 million.
