  By  Gilles Castonguay MILAN  Nov 3 (Reuters) - Mediaset SpA is considering a
multibillion-euro bid for control of ProSiebenSat.1 of Germany,
in what would be a major push abroad for Italy's biggest private
broadcaster, owned by former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.  But analysts were lukewarm about the possible value for
Mediaset and suggested it might not commit to what could be an
expensive purchase with little to extract from a company already
considered a tight-run ship.  A Mediaset ( MS.MI ) spokesman said the board would decide on
Tuesday when it discusses its third-quarter results whether to
go ahead with a bid for 50.5 percent of ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG
PSMG_p.DE, which has a total value of about 5 billion euros
($6.4 billion), according to Reuters data.  "It will consider the (possibility) of making an offer," he
said, confirming a report in Il Messaggero newspaper, which said
a winning bidder would then have to offer for the whole company.  The spokesman added that ProSiebenSat.1 had invited bids for
the stake and set next week as the deadline for submitting them.  A ProSiebenSat.1 spokeswoman declined comment.  Shares in ProSiebenSat.1 closed 0.6 percent lower at 22.85
euros, after jumping 4.4 percent at the opening of trade in
Frankfurt. In Milan, Mediaset closed 3.5 percent higher at 9.05
euros. The DJ Stoxx index of European media firms .SXMP was up
0.5 percent.  Il Messaggero said France's TF1, General Electric's ( GE.N )
NBC Universal and Spain's Antena 3 A3TV.MC were also potential
bidders, along with private equity firms Apax Partners
[APAX.UL], Permira [PERM.UL] and Blackstone [BG.UL].  A TF1 spokesman declined to comment and Antena 3 was not
available for comment.  "From a business perspective, it doesn't seem to make much
sense," said Rasbank analyst Oriana Cardani, comparing
ProSiebenSat.1 with Mediaset's Spanish business, Telecinco,
which she said has not brought great synergy advantages,
although it makes a profit.  "But it's always good to have a look at a business, another
company's figures," she added.  
  EXPENSIVE DEAL?  A London-based analyst said any offer could prove expensive
for the Italian company.  "They would have to pay 30 euros a share at least," he said.
"Mediaset would not be adding any value to the German business,
the management are running it perfectly well."  ProSiebenSat.1 trades just over 20 times expected earnings
compared with about 17 times for Mediaset, according to Reuters
data.  ProSiebenSat.1's owners had agreed to sell at 23.27 euros
per share earlier this year to German publisher Axel Springer
( SPRGn.DE ), but the deal was blocked by regulators.  U.S. billionaire Haim Saban, the main investor in the German
broadcaster, has been leading talks among private equity firms
about a possible sale of some of their stakes in ProSiebenSat.1,
people familiar with the situation told Reuters on Oct. 20.  The group -- German Media Partners -- holds 88 percent of
the voting shares and also includes Providence Equity Partners,
Bain Capital, Hellman & Friedman, Thomas H. Lee Partners,
Quadrangle Group, Alpine Equity Partners and Putnam Investments.  Saban and his partners paid 7.50 euros per common share for
ProSiebenSat.1 three years ago.  Analysts said Mediaset could also meet political opposition
in Germany, where some four years ago Berlusconi -- who was then
Italy's prime minister -- was warned against buying media group
Kirch by Germany's former chancellor Gerhard Schroder.  At home, Mediaset has criticised proposed changes to media
laws from the government of Prime Minister Romano Prodi, who
beat Berlusconi in April elections, which could limit its
expansion in advertising sales and heat up digital competition.  But analysts suggest Prodi's government, which holds power
with a very slim majority, would not be prove a serious threat
to Mediaset.  Il Messaggero said Mediaset had hired Citigroup to advise it
on a bid, adding that the winning bidder would then be obliged
to make an offer for the entire company.  Citigroup had no comment on the report.  JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley are advising German Media
Partners.
