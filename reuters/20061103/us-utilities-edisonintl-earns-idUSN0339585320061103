 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Edison International ( EIX.N ) on Friday reported slightly higher quarterly operating profit on improved results at its Southern California Edison utility unit and its unregulated Edison Mission Group. 

 Rosemead, California-based Edison said third-quarter operating earnings, excluding special items, rose to $436 million, or $1.32 per share, from $408 million, or $1.24 per share , a year earlier. Analysts polled by Reuters Estimates had forecast $1.24 per share. Net income slipped to $458 million, or $1.38 per share, from $462 million, or $1.41 per share. Edison stood by its 2006 operating earnings forecast of $2.91 per share. Analysts expect $2.93, according to Reuters Estimates. For 2007, the company said it expects total earnings of $3.05 to $3.45 per share. Southern California Edison, the second-largest utility in California, had third-quarter operating earnings of $239 million, up $20 million from a year earlier, helped by approval of its general rate case by the California Public Utilities Commission and earnings from its Mountainview power plant. Earnings from continuing operations at the Edison Mission Group, which includes the big Homer City coal-fired power plant in Pennsylvania and Midwest Generation, rose to $204 million from $159 million.
