 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Power company Duke Energy Corp. ( DUK.N ), which is in the process of spinning off its natural gas division, on Friday posted a lower-than-expected profit and cut its 2007 earnings targets for the two businesses. 

 Chief Financial Officer David Hauser told Reuters results were hit by lower natural gas prices in the U.S. Northeast, unexpected plant outages and higher operating expenses. The news weighed on Duke shares Friday, but Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Hugh Wynne noted Duke "had a very difficult quarter compared to last year because everything was going superbly well" in 2005. The company cut its 2007 earnings targets from its previous forecast of $2 per share for the two stand-alone companies, citing the sales of its marketing and trading business and a portion of its real estate unit. "We believe that the trade-off of lower earnings in '07 for a more stable and lower-risk company in the future is in our shareholders' best interest over the long term," Chief Executive James Rogers said on a conference call on Friday, though he would not give a specific forecast. The Charlotte, North Carolina-based company said net income totaled $763 million, or 60 cents per share, compared with $41 million, or 4 cents per share, a year earlier when the company took a large charge related to the sale of some of its wholesale power plants. Excluding special items and discontinued operations, ongoing earnings were 48 cents per share, well below the 56-cent profit expected by analysts polled by Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 37.8 percent to $4.2 billion in the quarter, following the completion of its merger with rival utility Cinergy Corp. Rogers told Reuters the company is still on track to complete the spin-off of its natural gas business by January 1, 2007. Executives reiterated the 4 to 6 percent earnings growth expectations for Duke Energy. The natural gas spin-off, which will be called Spectra Energy Corp., is expected to grow 5 to 7 percent. Shares in the company fell 1.6 percent, or 50 cents, to $30.99 on New York Stock Exchange trading on Friday. Since the beginning of the year, Duke Energy shares have gained about 15 percent. The Standard and Poor's utility index .GSPU has risen some 16 percent during the same period. The utility index is trading near multiyear highs as the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to stop interest rate hikes has helped the sector rebound from the power industry's severe downturn in 2002.
