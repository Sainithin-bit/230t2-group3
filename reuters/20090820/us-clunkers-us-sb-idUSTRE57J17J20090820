 (Reuters) - The U.S. government's "cash for clunkers" autos sales incentive program may be wound down as soon as early September, the Wall Street Journal said, citing a person familiar with the matter. 

 The U.S. government is expecting a surge in last-minute clunker deals when a closing date is announced and wants to avoid a situation where dealers agree to sales after the program's funds have been exhausted, the person told the paper. Under the program, the government gives consumers a rebate of up to $4,500 for trading in older, inefficient vehicles for new, fuel-sipping ones. Washington scrambled early this month to add $2 billion when the popular program's initial $1 billion funding was quickly spent. The U.S. Department of Transportation did not immediately respond to a Reuters email seeking comment. (Reporting by  Ajay Kamalakaran  in Bangalore; Editing by Hans Peters)
