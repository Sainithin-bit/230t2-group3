 MUNICH, Germany  (Reuters) - German Economy Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg said on Thursday he expects a General Motors board meeting on Friday to give a clear signal about the firm's preference in the bidding battle for carmaker Opel. 

 "I expect a clear signal from the GM board meeting on Friday," Guttenberg said at an event in the southern city of Munich. He also said Germany had received commitments from other European countries which have Opel plants that they would contribute to any aid for Opel. Canada's Magna MGa.TO is vying against Belgium-based investor RHJ International for control of Opel. (Reporting by Peter Maushagen, writing by Madeline Chambers)
