 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - H.J. Heinz Co HNZ.N posted lower quarterly profit on Thursday as the stronger dollar cut into sales overseas. 

 The company, which makes its namesake ketchup, Ore-Ida potatoes and Smart Ones frozen foods, also stood by its forecast for sales and earnings for fiscal year 2010. Profit fell to $219.1 million, or 67 cents a share, in the first quarter ended July 29, from $234.3 million, or 72 cents a share, a year earlier. For 2010, the company expects sales to rise 4 percent to 6 percent, excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, with earnings per share up 5 percent to 8 percent on that basis.
