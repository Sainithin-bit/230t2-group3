 (Reuters) - The Swiss government sold its stake in UBS at the top end of its price range, a source said on Thursday, making a profit from last year's rescue deal after the Swiss bank settled its U.S. tax dispute. 

 Following is a timeline: February 10, 2009 -- Posts a 2008 loss of 19.7 billion francs, the biggest ever for a Swiss company. Cuts 2,000 more jobs. February 18 -- Agrees to pay $780 million and identify certain U.S. clients to settle criminal fraud charges that it assisted rich Americans to evade taxes. February 19 -- U.S. tax authorities say they are still pursuing a civil lawsuit seeking to access details on 52,000 UBS clients. February 20 -- Warns that it could go out of business if it complies with an order to reveal the names of suspected U.S. tax dodgers and would require it to violate Swiss law in a manner that would expose it to penalties. February 26 -- Appoints Oswald Gruebel, former head of rival Credit Suisse, as chief executive, replacing Marcel Rohner. March 4 -- Chairman Peter Kurer steps down, replaced by Kaspar Villiger, a former Swiss finance minister. March 13 -- Switzerland agrees to make concessions on bank secrecy amid a global crackdown on tax evasion. April 2 -- U.S. authorities arrest and charge an accountant in Florida in the first of what they say could be a series of tax evasion prosecutions of American clients of UBS. May 5 -- Confirms a first-quarter net loss of 2 billion francs on yet more writedowns and client withdrawals, and announces staff cuts of 10,000. July 10 -- Gruebel sends a memorandum to the bank's top executives saying the bank could not comply with the U.S. request to disclose the identity of the 52,000 account holders. July 28 -- A U.S. client of UBS pleads guilty to using Swiss bank accounts to hide money from the U.S. taxman and says a Swiss government official received $45,000 to help cover up the fraud. Swiss prosecutors launch an investigation the next day. July 31 -- A U.S. Justice Department attorney says the U.S. and UBS have reached an agreement in principle to settle their tax dispute. August 4 -- UBS posts a Q2 net loss of 1.4 billion francs as wealthy clients are scared off by the tax row. August 12 -- A U.S. government attorney says agreements have been initialed to settle the tax evasion dispute. August 18 -- A filing in a U.S. federal court shows U.S. authorities are criminally investigating more than 150 U.S. clients of UBS. Aug 19 -- The Swiss government says it will hand over details of about 4,450 bank accounts to U.S. authorities as part of the deal to settle the UBS tax case. It effectively ends a separate civil lawsuit by U.S. authorities that sought up to 52,000 account names. August 20 -- Switzerland sells its 9 percent stake in UBS, amounting to 332 million shares at 16.50 Swiss francs per share, a source with direct knowledge of the deal says. -- The government will therefore take 5.5 billion Swiss francs ($5.1 billion), plus 1.8 billion francs to compensate for lost interest on the mandatory convertible notes, making a profit on the 6 billion francs it paid last October as part of a set of emergency measures.
