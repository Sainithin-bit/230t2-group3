 LONDON  (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley gatecrashed the Swiss government's sale of a $5.1 billion stake in its second biggest bank UBS on Thursday, sharing fees of over $50 million for arranging one of the year's biggest share sales. 

 The Swiss government paid fees of about 1.1 percent for the deal, or around 60 million Swiss francs ($56 million), according to people familiar with the deal. The government unsurprisingly chose UBS itself and domestic rival Credit Suisse to run the stake sale, but it also brought in Morgan Stanley. The size of the offer warranted three bookrunners, and Morgan Stanley has worked with the Swiss government and UBS in the past. It advised on the structuring of the government's investment in UBS in October and was an adviser on UBS's $15.4 billion rights issue last year. Fees for a placing are typically just over 1 percent. Governments can demand lower fees, although the banks guaranteed a minimum price for the UBS sale, which costs more. The Swiss had paid the banks a basis fee and an extra fee for the price above the minimum price, a spokesman for the finance ministry said. He declined to elaborate, but said normal fees for such deals were between 1 and 2 percent. "It was important to put a floor under the amount we would receive in the transaction when we started the bookbuilding process," said Peter Siegenthaler, the head of Switzerland's Federal Finance Administration. The Swiss government's sale of its 9 percent stake in UBS had been expected once the bank settled a long-running tax dispute with U.S. authorities, which was finalized on Wednesday. Some 332 million shares were sold in an accelerated bookbuild at 14.5 Swiss francs apiece, a slim 1.4 percent discount to Wednesday's closing price. The offer was about 4.5 times covered at the issue price, dealers said, helped by pent-up demand from investors who had been awaiting the sale. The share sale opened late on Wednesday, and books closed at 4:05 a.m. EDT. The deal netted a 1.2 billion franc profit for the Swiss government, including interest payments, after its 6 billion franc emergency bailout in October. It was the second biggest accelerated rapid share sale in Europe this year, after Abu Dhabi investors sold shares in Britain's Barclays Plc worth 3.5 billion pounds ($5.8 billion) in June. UK NEXT? UK Financial Investments, the body that holds Britain's stakes in its banks, will have been watching with a keen eye. Britain holds a 70 percent stake in Royal Bank of Scotland and 43 percent of Lloyds Banking Group after pumping 37 billion pounds into the pair, potentially rising to 70 billion pounds once additional "B" shares are issued. Selling those stakes would represent some of the biggest share deals ever and the process is expected to take several years. Britain has asked banks to submit proposals to assist it with the sale of its stakes and will soon choose a shortlist once it opts to move. Credit Suisse, Citigroup and Deutsche Bank have been advising the UK government on its bank rescue plans, but all major rivals are expected to pitch for the potentially lucrative business. Sweden remains the largest shareholder in Nordea, with a 20 percent stake, after the state had to rescue lenders during a crisis in the early 1990s.
