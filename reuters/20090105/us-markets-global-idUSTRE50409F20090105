 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - News about a planned U.S. stimulus package helped pull investors into the dollar on Monday but U.S. Treasury prices slumped on fears a price bubble is about to pop in the face of a massive wave of fresh debt. 

 European equities advanced for the fifth session in a row, spurred by gains in shares of oil companies on the back of rising crude prices. U.S. stocks were mostly lower as investors took profits on the rally that was racked up in thin trading last week. Oil prices hit a three-week high as Israel's deepening incursion into Gaza and a Russian gas dispute heightened fears about supplies. Prospects for a swelling supply of government debt drove U.S. and euro-zone prices down. The U.S. Treasury said it would sell $16 billion of reopened 10-year notes and $30 billion in three-year notes this week. While the issuance was broadly in line with market forecasts, it underscored this year's looming surge of debt that will to fund government efforts to rescue the financial system. U.S. President-elect Barack Obama plans $310 billion in tax cuts as part of a rescue package of up to $775 billion, senior Democratic aides said Sunday. German Chancellor Angela Merkel met her Social Democrat (SPD) coalition partners to discuss a second fiscal stimulus deal worth up to 50 billion euros ($68 billion). The 30-year Treasury bond fell nearly three full points in price, pushing its yield up to 2.92 percent, up from a record low near 2.52 percent in December. "The back-up in yields shows a growing sentiment toward questioning the lower rate environment we are in right now," said George Goncalves, chief Treasury/TIPS and agency strategist with Morgan Stanley in New York. The euro hit three-week lows versus the dollar, with weaker-than-expected Italian and Spanish inflation data and tax cuts in Germany expected to pressure the European Central Bank to soon cut rates further. U.S. stocks fell as investors took profits following last week's sharp gains. "Right now we're just watching and waiting to see if there is any news from the new administration and what type of news it will be," said Frank Lesh, a futures analyst and broker at FuturePath Trading LLC in Chicago. "We got a little bit of profit taking here," he added. Shares of Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ) rose after chief executive Steve Jobs wrote a letter aimed at dispelling investor concerns about his recent weight loss. Shares of the iPod maker rose 4.4 percent to $94.75 in early afternoon trade. Before 1 p.m., the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was down 79.09 points, or 0.88 percent, at 8,955.60. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was down 3.27 points, or 0.35 percent, at 928.53. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was down 8.52 points, or 0.52 percent, at 1,623.69. European equity markets were buoyed by the anticipation of further fiscal stimulus, drawing flows away from the safer-haven of government bonds. The FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of top European shares ended 1.9 percent higher at 873.01 points. The telecommunications sector was one of the biggest gainers on the index on the first full day of 2009 trading for many, with Swisscom ( SCMN.VX ) rising 5.2 percent, Cable and Wireless CW.L adding 4.6 percent, Vodafone ( VOD.L ) up 4.3 percent and Portugal Telecom ( PTC.LS ) rising 4.6 percent. Sharp losses for the euro, which was down 2.28 percent at $1.3559, also spread to euro/sterling, taking it to 0.9278, well away from record lows for the pound last week and easing momentum toward parity. The dollar rose against a basket of major trading-partner currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index .DXY up 1.74 percent at 82.923. Against the yen, the dollar rose 1.31 percent at 93.43 from a previous session close of 92.220. Longer maturity government debt fell, but shorter-term debt was little changed to higher. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell 34/32 in price to yield 2.47 percent, and the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond fell 102/32 in price to yield 2.94 percent. Oil rose, and has gained more than 35 percent since Israel launched its attack on Gaza on December 27, increasing concerns about the supply of crude from the Middle East. U.S. light sweet crude oil rose $1.11 to $47.45 a barrel. U.S. gold futures dropped, breaking below $850 an ounce, as investors took profits on the back of a dollar rally and signs of slowing physical demand. Spot gold prices fell $22.45 to $852.60 an ounce. Asian stocks rose to a two-month high on hopes massive government spending programs will revive a global economic recovery later this year. The MSCI index of Asia-Pacific stocks outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS climbed 1.6 percent to a two-month peak, while Japan's Nikkei average  .N225  gained 2.1 percent in a shortened session to reach a two-month high.
