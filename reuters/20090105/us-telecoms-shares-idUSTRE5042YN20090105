 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of top phone companies AT&T Inc ( T.N ) and Verizon Communications Inc ( VZ.N ) fell on Monday after Bernstein Research downgraded their ratings and price targets. 

 Bernstein analyst Craig Moffett lowered his rating on AT&T shares to "market perform" from "outperform" and lowered the target price to $27 from $35. He cut Verizon's rating to "underperform" from "market perform" and lowered the target to $27 from $32. "AT&T and Verizon may indeed be somewhat more recession-resistant than most business. But we believe they are nevertheless much more cyclically exposed than consensus estimates (and valuations) would suggest," he said in a report. AT&T shares fell 4 percent to $28.24, while Verizon shares fell 5.3 percent to $32.80. Analysts have lately been reassessing the outlook for U.S. telecommunications carriers and their network equipment vendors. While phone companies used to be considered recession-proof, consumers these days can easily disconnect landlines to go wireless or choose cheaper services. Carriers also require costly investment in new technologies, making them increasingly vulnerable to a downturn. (Reporting by  Ritsuko Ando ; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)
