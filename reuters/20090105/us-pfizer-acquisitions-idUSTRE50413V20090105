 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc ( PFE.N ), the world's biggest pharmaceutical group, is open to acquisitions, its chief executive Jeff Kindler told the Financial Times in an interview. 

 "The real goal is to grow revenues ... We are open to opportunities and constantly looking at those which are big, small and in-between," Kindler told the paper. Sales of Lipitor, Pfizer's $12 billion-a-year cholesterol fighter, are set to fall in 2011 when generic versions are slated to hit the market. "We will advance strategies to generate new and diverse sources of revenue growth and cost structures to position us to be strong after Lipitor," Kindler told the paper.
