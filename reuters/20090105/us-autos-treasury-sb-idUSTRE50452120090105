 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp will receive a second $5.4 billion installment of its government loan on January 16, the U.S. Treasury said on Monday. 

 In a transaction report for its bailout fund, the Treasury said it has approved the release of a total of $9.4 billion for GM, including $4 billion disbursed on December 31 and $5.4 billion to be funded on Jan 16. The Treasury has agreed to lend GM another $4 billion, but those funds would come from a second $350 billion tranche of the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program that Congress could block. GM on Monday reported a 31 percent decline in December U.S. sales compared with a year earlier, capping a 23 percent decline for all of 2008. (Reporting by  David Lawder ; Editing by Dan Grebler)
