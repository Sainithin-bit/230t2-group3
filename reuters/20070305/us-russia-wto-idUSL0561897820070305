 SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - Russia on Monday repudiated criticism from the European Union and United States that it was dragging its feet in talks on joining the World Trade Organization and said it still hoped to accede this year. 


 "As of today we are fulfilling all the commitments that we have taken on," Economy and Trade Minister German Gref told reporters in Singapore. "I'm not sure whether we will be able to complete the accession process this year. There is a chance to make it on time but I can't radiate certainty." Gref spoke after the EU's ambassador to Moscow said Russia was failing to fulfil trade commitments and its negotiators lacked urgency in the final, multilateral stage of the WTO entry process. "We have heard a lot from our Russian partners that joining the WTO is a priority," ambassador Marc Franco told the Kommersant daily in an interview. "But the way the negotiations are going and poor fulfilment of bilateral commitments raises doubts over whether Russia will become a member by the end of 2007." Amid fanfare, Russia wrapped up bilateral WTO talks last November with the United States, completing a series of country-by-country agreements needed before negotiating a comprehensive deal with the 150-member WTO. Russia's $1 trillion economy is the largest outside the WTO and investors say joining could deliver the kind of economic boost to the one enjoyed by China after it joined the trade club in 2001. A mission spokeswoman said EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson would visit Moscow in late March for talks with Russian trade officials. BACKSLIDING Franco said that of particular concern was backsliding by Russia on commitments written into a bilateral WTO deal with the EU signed in 2004. "Their execution is taking a lot of time, although we think that fulfilling some of them should be quite simple," he told Kommersant. "We hope that, in the final analysis, Russia fulfils its commitments in time." Areas of concern singled out by Franco included tariffs on goods shipped by rail and licensing of imports of alcoholic beverages. EU member Finland said last week that a hike in Russian timber export duties had violated the 2004 agreement. Franco's remarks echoed criticism last week by U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab, who said Russia had a "great deal to do to get the multilateral part of its WTO accession agreement concluded". Schwab said there were "critical issues" concerning agriculture and the protection of intellectual property rights, where the United States wants Russia to crack down on software and video piracy.
