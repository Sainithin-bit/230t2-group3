 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Chrysler Group sales outside North 
America rose 9 percent in February to 15,194 units, the U.S. 
arm of DaimlerChrysler DCXGn.DE said on Monday. 


  After its best February since 1998, Chrysler sales in the 
first two months of 2007 were up 10 percent versus the same 
period of 2006, the carmaker said in a statement.  Boosting foreign sales by itself or with partners is a 
crucial objective for loss-making Chrysler, regarding which 
DaimlerChrysler has said it is examining strategic options 
including a sale or spinoff.  Chrysler Group includes the Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep 
brands.  The Dodge Caliber compact launched last year is the 
top-selling Chrysler vehicle outside North America so far this 
year, with 4,834 units sold, it said.  "The global success of Dodge Caliber shows us that there is 
a significant group of customers in European and international 
markets who are attracted to the bold and unique 
characteristics of the Dodge brand," Chrysler's head of 
international sales, Thomas Hausch, said in the statement.  In February alone, the Chrysler 300C car led the product 
line-up with 2,629 units sold, an increase of 57 percent.  Italy is Chrysler's largest overseas market by volvolumeme 
with sales up 2 percent to 3,363 units so far in 2007. It is 
followed by Germany, where 2007 sales have risen 13 percent to 
2,372 units.
