 MUMBAI/SEOUL  (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor Co. ( 005380.KS ) 
denied on Monday a report that South Korea's top auto maker 
planned to set up a light commercial vehicle plant in India. 


  Earlier in the day, India's Business Line paper said 
Hyundai would build a factory that will initially produce 
one-tonne trucks near Pune in the western Indian state of 
Maharashtra, citing sources close to the development. The 
company may also set up a powertrain facility to build engines 
and gearboxes, it said.  "It is totally not true. We have not reviewed such a 
project," a Hyundai spokesman said by telephone.  Hyundai, the second-biggest car maker in India, has said 
before it was studying the Indian market for trucks and buses, 
which is dominated by Tata Motors Ltd. ( TAMO.BO ).  Ashok Leyland Ltd. ( ASOK.BO ) and smaller rivals Eicher 
Motors ( EICH.BO ) and Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. ( MAHM.BO ) also 
compete.  The potential of India's rapidly expanding economy has also 
drawn foreign firms. Mahindra has a joint venture with Navistar 
International NAVZ.PK for trucks and buses, while MAN AG 
( MANG.DE ) has a deal with Force Motors Ltd. ( FORC.BO ).  Hyundai is setting up a second car plant in Chennai in 
southern India to double its capacity to 600,000 units by 
end-2007. It is also building an engine and transmission plant 
there with a capacity of at least 400,000 units.  Shares in Hyundai ended down 0.73 percent at 68,300 won on 
Seoul's stock market, compared with the broader market's 
 .KS11  2.71 percent drop.
