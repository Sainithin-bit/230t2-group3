 LONDON  (Reuters) - Private equity firm Blackstone Group is buying the owner of Madame Tussauds waxworks museums for about 1 billion pounds ($1.9 billion) cash, creating the world's second-biggest theme park group behind Walt Disney Co. 


 The deal, announced on Monday, would combine Tussauds, one of London's biggest tourist attractions, Sea Life aquariums and the London Eye Ferris wheel with Blackstone-owned BG.UL Legoland and Gardaland theme parks, which are held in its Merlin Entertainments Group. The newly enlarged tourist attraction group plans to accelerate expansion, particularly in North America, with a Legoland in the Kansas City area and a Sea Life in California already in the works. "If we were sitting here five years from now, I think we'd be disappointed if we weren't operating 10 businesses, from three now, under three different brand names in America," Merlin Chief Executive Nick Varney said in an interview. Tussauds is also planning to open waxworks museums, home to lifelike recreations of the world's biggest celebrities ranging from Queen Elizabeth to Brad Pitt, in Washington this year and in Hollywood in 2008. The group is planning to spend between 60 million and 90 million euros ($78.8-$118.2 million) each year to roll out about four or five attractions, he added, to exploit the brands and marketing before an eventual IPO. "I think all those things point to a stock market flotation in three or four years' time," Varney said. "That is probably the most likely outcome." Dubai International Capital (DIC), a government-backed buyout firm, bought Tussauds for 800 million pounds two years ago. It is retaining a 20 percent stake in the merged group. The combined 50 attractions and four hotels drew about 30 million visitors last year. Only Disney's ( DIS.N ) parks, including Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, attract more visitors globally. Merlin and Tussauds currently rank sixth and seventh, respectively, Varney said. The new group, which does not anticipate much in the way of cost savings from the combination, is aiming to create clusters of short-visit and long-term attractions with related hotels, enabling more efficient marketing and revenue growth. Tussauds was sold by Pearson Plc ( PSON.L ), the world's biggest educational publisher, in 1998 to Charterhouse Capital Partners for about 350 million pounds. It has grown from 30 million pounds of profit and 2,000 employees since then to 100 million pounds of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and 6,000 staff last year, Tussauds CEO Peter Phillipson said. The Tussauds group also operates the Alton Towers, Thorpe Park and Chessington World of Adventures theme parks in Britain. Merlin, meanwhile, operates The Dungeons and Earth Explorer tourist sites, in addition to four Legoland theme parks and Italy's biggest theme park, Gardaland. Citigroup advised DIC and Tussauds, Goldman Sachs advised Blackstone and Lehman Bros. and UBS advised Merlin. (Additional reporting by  Marc Jones )
