 GENEVA  (Reuters) - The days when Henry Ford could offer one model of car in one color are long gone. 


 The huge variety of new models on display at the Geneva International Motor Show, from small city cars to people carriers and high-performance sports cars, demonstrate how automakers are trying to keep up with a market that is fracturing into many niches. Carmakers need to offer vehicles of all shapes and sizes, while still having big enough production runs to keep costs low in a very competitive market. "Something has to give in Europe. The market is split between too many (manufacturers) with excessive product and powertrain proliferation," UBS analysts said in a recent note. They expect the industry to fail to raise profit margins and then turn to mergers and acquisitions, out of desperation. But for the next few years, the automakers are banking on new product launches to kick-start sluggish sales and the annual Geneva show, opening to the media on Tuesday and to the public on Thursday, will reflect that. Fast cars and gas guzzlers may still appeal to rich men, but manufacturers also offer models with low fuel consumption, family vehicles and cars designed to appeal to women. Following is a summary of the main new models on display: AUDI ( NSUG.DE ) Audi will present the A5, a coupe version of the A4 with styling elements from the TT model. It also has an S5 variant.
