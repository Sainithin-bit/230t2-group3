 LISBON  (Reuters) - Shares in Sonaecom ( SNC.LS ) fell more than 14 percent on Monday after it failed in its 11.8-billion euro hostile takeover bid for larger rival Portugal Telecom ( PTC.LS ), traders said. 


 Sonaecom shares traded 14.8 percent lower at 4.7 euros per share at 0811 GMT while Portugal Telecom ( PTC.LS ) shares were 2.42 percent lower at 9.66 euros. Lisbon's main PSI20  .PSI20  index was off 1.8 percent. "This is the result of Sonaecom's failed bid. We estimate Sonaecom to be worth 4.5 euros per share on a stand-alone basis," said Ricardo Seara, an analyst at local bank BPI. Sonaecom shares had risen before its bid for Portugal Telecom failed as the proposed merger between the two was seen carrying significant synergies for their telecoms business.
