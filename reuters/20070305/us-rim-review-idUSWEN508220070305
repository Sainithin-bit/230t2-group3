 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Research in Motion Ltd. RIMM.O RIM.TO on Monday said a review of stock options grants will cause it to restate its financial statements for fiscal 2004, 2005 and 2006 as well as the first quarter of 2007. 


 The Blackberry maker said it expects to reduce the amount of previously reported GAAP earnings up to the end of fiscal-year 2006 by an aggregate amount of about $250 million. The company also said it will implement changes to its board, audit committee, compensation committee and nominating committee.
