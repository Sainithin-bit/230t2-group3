 LONDON  (Reuters) - Shares in British Airways BAY.L dropped more than 6 percent on Monday after a newspaper report that pilots at its GB Airways unit were voting on industrial action over Easter, traders said. 


 The shares fell 6.5 percent to 497 pence. The Sunday Times said that if a strike was called, it could affect flights from Gatwick, Heathrow, Bristol and East Midlands. "The report is putting some pressure on the shares," a trader said, adding that the weak market sentiment did not help. The FTSE 100 was down 1.5 percent amid a continued sell-off in global equities.
