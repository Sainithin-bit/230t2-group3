 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Disk drive leader Seagate Technology STX.N predicted rapid growth in demand for its products, especially notebooks, which is likely to fuel sustained double-digit revenue growth in percentage terms. 


 "We believe we will see double-digit unit growth and actually double-digit revenue growth," Chief Executive William Watkins told investors attending the Morgan Stanley Technology Conference in San Francisco on Monday. Speaking alongside Watkins, Seagate Chief Financial Officer Charles Pope offered more specifics. "We believe unit growth in the next several years will be in a range from 13 to 17 percent, with revenue growth in excess of 10 percent." Revenue for Seagate's fiscal year ending in June is forecast to grow around 20 percent to $11.65 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. For fiscal 2008, however, the growth rate is expected to decelerate to around 7.8 percent to reach $12.55 billion in sales. Seagate officials also said the post-merger integration of disk drive maker Maxtor is largely complete. The company had previously signaled it was working off an overhang of Maxtor disk inventory amounting to a few hundred thousand units in December and that this would put pressure on margins for the second quarter ending in March. Watkins reiterated that: "We expected margins for this quarter to get into the low end of the target range." Demand for storage used in notebook computers is "kind of on fire," Watkins said. "We continue to see 20 to 25 percent year-on-year growth." Seagate's CEO said demand for its disk drives for use in business desktop computers is likely to be in the single digits in percentage terms over the next couple of years. Desktop storage growth is being fueled by demand in fast-growing emerging markets such as Brazil, Russia, India and China, the so-called BRIC market, where low-end PCs predominate, he said. Expansion into consumer electronics markets is also likely to fuel long-term growth, the Seagate executives said. "I believe strongly that every TV in the world is going to have a hard drive," Watkins said. Shares of Seagate were up 5 cents to $24.69 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
