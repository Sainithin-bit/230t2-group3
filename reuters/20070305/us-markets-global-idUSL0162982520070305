 LONDON  (Reuters) - Nervous investors fled risky assets again on Monday, battering global stock markets as long-standing speculative bets on a weak Japanese currency unravelled amid a surge of yen strength. 


 High-yield debt, gold and other commodities took a hit but demand for safe-haven government bonds was strong. European stocks shed more than 2 percent following more than 3 percent losses in Japan and in emerging markets. The yen was at three month highs, up more than 1 percent against the dollar. Metals prices tumbled 3-4 percent while oil lost $1 a barrel. The moves follow a tumultuous few days on financial markets last week during which worries over the state of the U.S. and Chinese economies combined with fears for the so-called yen carry trade to drive investors away from many of riskier assets. Notable among these were equities, which have been booming over the past year. "Equity markets had gone up a lot and almost uninterruptedly since last June and some markets had perhaps become a little expensive, creating the right climate for a fall," Henderson Global Investors said in a note. European shares were down sharply, adding to an earlier sell-off on Asian bourses. The FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  was trading down around 2 percent lower, taking losses to more than 7 percent over the past week. Shares on Germany's DAX  .GDAXI  lost 2 percent, Britain's FTSE 100  .FTSE  was down 1.6 percent and France's CAC 40  .FCHI  down 1.9 percent. Earlier, Tokyo's Nikkei average fell 3.34 percent, marking its biggest one-day tumble in nine months and a new low for 2007, as investors continued to dump shares in exporters following the yen's rise. It lost 575.68 points to 16,642.25 its lowest close since December and its biggest one-day percentage loss since June 2006. CARRY TRADE An across the board surge in the Japanese yen was fraying investor nerves in particular. The yen struck a three-month high against the dollar as investors rushed to reverse "carry trade" bets against the currency. Ultra-low interest rates in Japan had encouraged many investors to borrow yen and use the money to invest in high-yielding currencies and their assets elsewhere. "Massive investment in carry trades is rather like stretching an elastic band and hoping that it does not snap," Mitul Kotecha, head of FX strategy at Calyon, said in a note. The dollar tumbled to a three-month low of 115.16 yen and was last at 115.37 yen, down 1.2 percent from late last week. The euro fell to 151.22 yen, down 1.8 percent. Sterling, one of the major high-yielding currencies in the carry trade, fell to its lowest level against the dollar in more than three months and the lowest against the yen since October. It dropped to $1.9208, down around 1.2 percent, and fell more than 2 percent to around 221.81 yen. RISKY VS SAFE A broad range of riskier markets were suffering from the investor shift in sentiment. -- Gold XAU= fell to a 6-week low, while lead, zinc and nickel futures dropped by more than 4 percent. -- The iTraxx Crossover index, mainly made up of high-yield credit and seen as a gauge of risk appetite, widened sharply. One trader said the index had widened 74 basis points over the past 10 days. -- MSCI's main emerging market stock index was down 3.75 percent on the day and has now lost more than 10 percent in a week. -- Oil lost more than $1 to trade at less than $61 a barrel as traders worried about equity price losses. Government bonds were the major beneficiary of the lack of risk appetite. Ten-year euro zone government bond yields hit their lowest level this year and prices of U.S. Treasuries gained. The 10-year Bund yield was down 3.9 basis points at 3.893 percent. The U.S. equivalent was down 4.7 basis points at 4.456 percent.
