 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The White House declined to comment on a new drop in the stock market on Monday but said the global economy remains "extremely strong." 


 White House spokesman Tony Snow said Bush administration officials were keeping a close eye on the markets. Asked if President George W. Bush had spoken to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, Snow said: "I don't want to generate a sense of crisis here." Snow said he was not going to characterize concern or lack of concern in stock markets "only to note that the global economy remains extremely strong." He cited a rise in stock markets in Japan and China over the past year.
