 LONDON  (Reuters) - European shares sank to three-month lows on Monday, led by banks and resource stocks, as the global equity sell-off continued to batter investor confidence and the yen hit three-month highs against the dollar. 


 Among major movers, British Airways tumbled after the European Union and United States came to a provisional "open skies" deal while Sonaecom tumbled after its hostile bid for its rival Portugal Telecom failed. "We think that the dominant issue facing markets in the second half of 2007, i.e. after the correction, will be the search for genuine, sustainable growth," said ING strategists. By 1114 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 2.3 percent at 1,429.4 points, hitting its lowest since December 5 as investors sold stocks across sectors. The European benchmark has lost 8 percent since last Tuesday, when a 9-percent drop in Chinese stocks combined with ongoing growth worries sparked a global equity shake-out which threatened to end a stock market bull run. Investors remain increasingly concerned about an unwinding in the carry trade, or bets on riskier assets financed by borrowing the yen. The dollar and the euro both fell to three-month lows against the Japanese currency on Monday. "I estimate we're about half-way through a 10 percent correction, and some buyers should start emerging after a 2.5 percent fall," said Brewin Dolphin's chief strategist, Mike Lenhoff. "The trigger was China; now that the trigger has been pulled, people are reflecting on the strong economy and continued growth in corporate earnings, and that central banks have a tightening bias." Germany's DAX index fell 2.2 percent, while FTSE 100 dropped 1.9 percent and CAC 40 was down 2 percent. The DAX-NEW volatility index was up 5.9 percent. CONTAGION Earlier, Japanese shares fell 3.3 percent in the Nikkei's biggest fall in nine months. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average closed Friday down 1 percent at 12,114.10 points while Nasdaq ended 1.5 percent lower. Commodity stocks weighed in Europe, with BP down 2.2 percent while Total fell 1.9 percent as oil fell by 1.6 percent to $60.60 as the stock market slide spilled over. Mining stocks also languished, with Antofagasta down 4.3 percent and BHP Billiton 3.9 percent lower as copper prices dropped. Banking stocks were in the spotlight after Europe's biggest bank, HSBC, traded flat after its profits rose by slightly less than analysts had expected. It outperformed the remainder of the sector, with Barclays down 1.2 percent, Lloyds TSB 1.2 percent and Deutsche Bank down 2 percent. British Airways ranked among major losers, falling as much as 10 percent after the United States and Europe agreed the outline of a proposed pact that could open competition on its profitable transatlantic routes. Among other major movers, Sonaecom sank 14 percent after failing in its bid for Portugal Telecom, whose shares also slipped 2.6 percent. Royal & Sun Alliance ranked as a rare gainer, adding 1.4 percent after completing the sale of its U.S. operation. For a factbox on financial markets, please double click on
