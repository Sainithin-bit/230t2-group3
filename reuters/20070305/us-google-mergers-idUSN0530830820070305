 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Google Inc. ( GOOG.O ) is spinning off growing mounds of cash from operations, but Chief Executive Eric Schmidt appeared to rule out seeking big mergers or making other dramatic changes in how the company uses cash. 


 Speaking to investors at the Morgan Stanley Technology Conference, Schmidt was asked by analyst Mary Meeker whether Google would consider changing course on how it uses cash. "It is highly unlikely," Schmidt said. "One of the problems in high-tech industries is that successful companies tend to generate cash pretty liberably (but) they don't have good places to put it." He added that, while Google itself is generating a mounting pile of cash, "it is not obvious to me where it would go." Google invests heavily in data centers and network capacity that it uses to expand the range and depth of its Web services. At the end of 2006, Google had $11.2 billion in cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet, up around 40 percent from the end of 2005 when it held $8.03 billion, according to company statements.
