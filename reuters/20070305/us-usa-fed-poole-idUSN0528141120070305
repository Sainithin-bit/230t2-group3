 SANTIAGO  (Reuters) - St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President William Poole said on Monday the U.S. economy did not appear headed for recession and that the central bank was in a good position to provide a "stable policy base" to help volatile financial markets steady themselves over time. 


 "To me, and, I believe, the mainstream of forecasters both in government and out, we do not see a recession on the horizon," Poole said in answer to a question after speaking to a business audience in Santiago, Chile. "Moreover, beyond our own judgments on that as forecasters, I don't think that the markets see (recession)," he added. Poole, a voting member of the Fed's policy-setting panel this year, said expectations of U.S. interest rate cuts this year, as implied by futures markets, had grown only slightly. "The market itself, to me, is not showing evidence that estimates of recession are really in the cards," Poole said. The St. Louis Fed chief said there were no "underlying shocks" to explain the sharp drop in equities prices over the past week and said that without a clearer view of what was behind the market turmoil it was better not to "make any plans to have any policy adjustments." He also said it was not appropriate for the Fed to respond to stock market drops unless "large or extremely disruptive" and said last week's decline would probably not prove significant historically. "With a very stable inflation environment, no change of inflation expectations in the U.S. bond market as a result of the events of last week, that gives us a very, very strong base -- a stable policy base -- to help stabilize the markets over time," he said. "So, the markets can react to whatever is going on without fear that there is some underlying policy complication that would exacerbate the underlying disturbance, whatever it is." The Fed, the U.S. central bank, has held benchmark overnight interest rates steady at 5.25 percent since June. While the Fed continued to warn of inflation risks after its last meeting on January 30-31, financial markets now expect a rate cut by mid-year. ECONOMY STILL SOUND In his speech, Poole said the Fed's success at keeping inflation low and stable had improved the economy's resilience, helping to ward off broader weakness as the housing sector turned down. "We have seen little fallout from the ending of the housing boom," he said, adding: "Needless to say, I doubt that our financial system or economy would show such resilience if inflation were not low and stable." A sharp downturn in the once-hot U.S. housing sector dragged economic growth back to a 2.2 percent annualized pace in the fourth quarter, but consumer spending remains strong and the Fed expects output to gradually pick up this year. Poole repeated his long-standing support for a specific inflation target, a topic being examined by the Fed under the leadership of Chairman Ben Bernanke as part of a wider study of communications strategy. Some members of the Democrat-controlled Congress worry an inflation target could come at the expense of employment, the other leg of the central bank's legal dual mandate. But Poole said anchoring inflation expectations made it easier for policy-makers to cut rates and cushion the economy from a shock like the September 11, 2001, attacks. He said the Fed should aim to keep nonfood, non-energy inflation at 1.5 percent "plus or minus a range of 0.5 percent to allow for unavoidable short-run fluctuations." "I would like monetary policy to aim at 1.5 percent core inflation and not just accept inflation barely inside one end or the other of a 1 to 2 percent range," Poole said.
