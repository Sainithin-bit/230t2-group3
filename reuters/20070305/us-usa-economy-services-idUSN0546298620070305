 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. service sector grew for the 47th straight month in February, although the rate of expansion moderated more than expected from January's torrid pace and pricing pressures eased, a report showed on Monday. 


 The Institute for Supply Management's services index slid to 54.3 from 59.0 in January, which was its highest in eight months. February's result, the weakest since April 2003, was below the 57.2 median forecast of analysts polled by Reuters. Still, a number above 50 indicates growth, and the index is closing in on its fourth consecutive year of expansion. The last time the service index was below 50 was in March 2003. The survey's underlying components also remained on a solid expansionary track, even though there was some moderation from January's readings. The prices-paid component of the index fell to 53.8 from 55.2, though the employment component rose to 52.2 from 51.7. The survey's new orders component was 54.8 in February, versus 55.4 in January. After a week of turmoil on Wall Street, stocks fluctuated between the plus and minus levels in volatile trading. Government bond prices erased earlier gains. Analysts said they saw nothing alarming in the drop in the February ISM service index, particularly since January's reading was the highest since 59.2 in May 2006. "I don't think it's telling us that there is a recession looming," said Linda Duessel, senior vice president and market strategist at Federated Investors in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Forecasts for the index had ranged from 55.0 to 59.5. "The ISM non-manufacturing headline was disappointing, but the breakdown is not nearly as poor as the headline would suggest," said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital in Greenwich, Connecticut. "The headline will, however, only add to fears that the economy may be losing a little momentum, even allowing for the breakdown," he added. The service sector represents about 80 percent of U.S. economic activity, including businesses such as restaurants, hotels, hair salons, banks and airlines. However, investors' reaction to the report might be somewhat constrained by the approach of Friday's monthly jobs report, which usually has a bigger influence on markets.
