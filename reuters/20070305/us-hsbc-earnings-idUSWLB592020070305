 LONDON  (Reuters) - HSBC Holdings ( HSBA.L ) on Monday said its 2006 profits rose 5 percent, short of analysts' expectations, as Europe's biggest bank took a $10.6 billion hit for bad debts after problems in its U.S. mortgage lending. 


 HSBC ( 0005.HK ) reported a record 2006 pretax profit of $22.1 billion, up from $21 billion in 2005, but below an average forecast of $22.4 billion in a poll of analysts by Reuters Estimates. The bank, with headquarters in London, said there had been no further deterioration in its troubled U.S. mortgage lending since it warned about the deepening problem a month ago, and it was confident the problems would not spread to other areas. By 1045 GMT HSBC shares were down 0.2 percent at 885 pence, valuing the bank at 103 billion pounds ($200.9 billion). The bank warned on February 7 that problems had deepened in its lending to higher risk U.S. home borrowers, resulting in the steep jump in bad debts charge and prompting it to oust the head of its North America operations and restructure the business. "It has not deteriorated (since then)," Douglas Flint, finance director, told reporters on a conference call. He said the level of bad debts this year will be sensitive to economic conditions, the housing market, interest rates levels and the availability of financing options for sub-prime borrowers. Flint said he was confident the impairment problems would not spread wider. "There is no additional concern elsewhere in the world in relation to abnormal credit trends. The abnormal credit trends are all in the mortgage services business," he said. Mark Durling, banking analyst at Brewin Dolphin, said last month's warning cushioned the impact and HSBC is seen as conservative in terms of impairments. "There is some more (bad debt) pain to come, but not as bad as what the market has factored into the share price," he said. HSBC said its group impairment charge was up $2.8 billion, or 36 percent, from 2005, and the "major setback" had caused a $725 million drop in its U.S. personal finance profits. "We are restructuring this business to avoid any repetition of the risk concentration that built up over the past two years," it said in a statement. This included changes in management and strengthened risk controls and processes. CIBM GROWTH SLOWS The bank's CIBM investment bank arm posted a 12 percent rise in profits to $5.8 billion, aided by buoyant capital markets, although the unit's profit growth slowed from 37 percent in the first half. "In the third quarter there was a significant slowdown in flow from client revenues," Flint said. "The fourth quarter bounced back, so we had three good quarters and one weak quarter." HSBC said its income rose 14 percent to $70.1 billion, matched by a 14 percent rise in cost growth. Its costs as a ratio of income nudged to 51.3 percent from 51.2 percent in 2005.
