 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japanese Finance Minister Koji Omi said on Monday that he agreed with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson that both Japanese and U.S. economies are firm, while Paulson reiterated that the yen's value should be decided by markets. 


 The meeting of two top officials of the world's first and second largest economies took place in Tokyo as the yen surged across the board and stock prices around the world kept falling. "We agreed that both United States and Japanese economies are moving smoothly," Omi told reporters after meeting Paulson. Paulson has steadfastly maintained that the value of the Japanese currency is led by markets and that Japan has not intervened in the currency market since March 2004. "The yen is market-determined and that's the way it should be," Paulson said in response to a reporter's question on the meeting with Omi. The yen surged on Monday as another wave of investors rushed to reverse bets against the Japanese currency with the market still anxious over tumbling stock markets. The dollar hit a three-month low of 115.16 yen, before coming back to around 115.40 by 1318 GMT. Omi said the market mechanism is working well and he was not worried about recent movements in stock and currency markets. "The Japanese economy is steadily recovering under price stability, while the U.S. economy as a whole is doing well," Omi said. "In that sense, the market mechanism is working well... I am not worried," he said of the stocks fall and the yen's recent rise. He was unclear if the view was shared by Paulson. "Market movements should reflect fundamentals. Specific levels should be left to markets," Omi added. Omi said the two discussed recent movements in stock and currency markets, but stressed that the two did not talk about specific levels. "With respect to stock and currency prices, fundamentals are firm." Omi said. "There was absolutely no talk on whether a specific level is too high or low." Omi and Paulson agreed to keep close contact with each other on global economies as well as North Korea, Omi said. U.S. Treasury officials have said that during his two days in Japan, Paulson would encourage Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and other top officials, including Omi and Bank of Japan Governor Toshihiko Fukui, to do all they can to speed up growth. Earlier in the day, Paulson told reporters after meeting with Abe that he had a "nice visit" and discussed the economy and economic reforms. Abe also told reporters that he talked with Paulson about Japanese economic conditions and what Tokyo has been doing with its pro-growth strategy and reforms. Asked if they discussed financial markets, including a fall in share prices, Abe said: "I explained that the Japanese economy is gradually recovering."
