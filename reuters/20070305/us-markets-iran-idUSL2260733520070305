-- Iran still a cloud for chastened world markets

 LONDON  (Reuters) - In all the current market ructions, one of the initial reasons or excuses cited for the sell-off seems to have dropped off the screen -- Iran. 


 But investors could be in for a shock. Risk analysts say there could be an up to one-in-three chance that the United States or Israel will attack Iran by the end of this year, and markets may not be doing enough to hedge against the impact. While a strike on Iran's nuclear facilities may still be far from likely, the surprise factor and worries about Iranian retaliation mean the market reaction could be far harsher than it was to the 2003 invasion of Iraq -- especially if investors' thirst for risk survives the current shakeout. "We are entering this situation in financial markets in a rather more vulnerable state than we were in 2003 ... because people have loaded up on risk," said Mark Cliffe, global head of economics and strategy at ING. "We expect sharp falls in stock markets, industrial raw materials, and in interest rates, and a huge widening in credit spreads," he told a round-table discussion on Friday. "We had a foretaste of that reaction this week but the important thing is that the magnitudes will be substantially greater." Cliffe and Charles Robertson, ING's chief economist for emerging Europe, Middle East and Africa, co-authored a report in January called "Attacking Iran", assessing the market impact of a surprise Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear facilities. They see huge initial turmoil, with subsequent moves hard to forecast as they would be driven by whatever happened next. Although they put no exact figure on the probability of an attack by either Israel or the United States, and still say the immediate likelihood is low, they argue that President Bush might sanction some kind of military action before he leaves office late next year. TIT-FOR-TAT ESCALATION Several political risk consultancies take a similar view. The United States, Israel and Iran all stepped up their rhetoric after Tehran ignored a February 21 U.N. deadline to halt uranium enrichment, and Washington has sent a second aircraft carrier to the Gulf. Neither the United States nor Israel is likely to be planning an imminent attack, analysts say. Relative doves such as Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice seem to have the upper hand right now over hawkish Vice President Dick Cheney, and Washington has opened the door to talks with Iran over Iraq. But the trigger for a U.S. strike could be more indirect. Washington accuses Tehran of arming militias attacking U.S. troops in Iraq, while Tehran accuses Washington of stirring violent sectarian and ethnic discontent in Iran. A series of tit-for-tat incidents could escalate and tip the political balance in Washington, spilling into a strike on Iran's nuclear facilities. "I do think the chances of that happening are one in three ... by the end of this year," said Heinrich Matthee, Iran analyst at London-based Control Risks. "Some people really want to stop or delay the nuclear program by force. They're not dominating debate any more, it seems, and this may be the opportunity." PLACE YOUR BETS One betting Web site, www.intrade.com, was showing odds of 20 percent on Monday on the United States and/or Israel making an overt air strike on Iran by the end of this year. Last week the odds were as high as one in four. "I'd concur with that," said James Howarth, a Middle East analyst with political risk forecasters Exclusive Analysis. "I'd probably say it's more likely in a year's time than now -- the end of this year, beginning of next." The U.S.-based Eurasia Group listed Iran at the top of its seven biggest political risks for 2007, and although it thinks a U.S. strike this year is unlikely, it put the probability of an attack by the third quarter of 2008 as high as 60 percent. "President George W. Bush is very unlikely to leave office with the legacy of having watched Iran go nuclear," it said. Matthee said businesses mulling direct investment in Iran were certainly holding back at the moment. But in the financial markets, Cliffe said investors were not doing as much as they could to hedge the risk of a strike. The VIX -- Wall St's so-called "fear index" of implied volatility and options pricing used to hedge movements in S&P 500 stocks -- is still historically low despite shooting up from about 12 to 18 since market turmoil started last week. In October 1987 it hit 171.52, and it was around 30 at the time of the Iraq invasion. "It's actually very cheap to take out financial protection," Cliffe said. "Out-of-the-money options are still extremely cheap."
