 LONDON  (Reuters) - British insurer Royal & Sun Alliance ( RSA.L ) (RSA) said on Monday it had completed the disposal of its U.S. operation to Arrowpoint Capital Corp., the company set up by the unit's management, causing its shares to rise. 


 "The disposal achieves the group's objective of bringing certainty and finality to its exposure to the U.S. operation," the company said in a statement. The deal's completion will cause relief in the market, after the company last month sparked fears it could walk away from the sale because of a string of conditions placed on its approval by the Delaware Insurance Commissioner. RSA shares were trading up 2.4 percent at 151.1-3/4 pence at 0851 GMT, making it one of the biggest gainers in Europe. The DJ Stoxx Insurance Index .SXIP was down over 2 percent. "I view this as excellent news. The company has confirmed it hasn't put any more money in and I would guess it is much harder for third parties to come after Royal & Sun now for U.S. claims," said ING Financial Markets' analyst Kevin Ryan. The sale of the troubled unit, which has hemorrhaged cash due to rising claims, had been fought by disgruntled policyholders, including General Motors ( GM.N ) and the World Trade Center's Larry Silverstein, who said they feared their claims may not be paid. RSA agreed to sell the unit in September 2006 for 158 million pounds ($308.2 million), although the sale would be funded by future performance of the unit, while RSA will provide the unit with a 151 million pound capital injection as part of the deal. Some analysts have speculated the completion of the deal to sell the U.S. unit will remove a cloud and could make the company an attractive bid target.
