 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. GAP.N said on Monday that it planned to buy rival grocer Pathmark Stores Inc. PTMK.O for $678.6 million, creating a larger company to compete in the U.S. Northeast. 


 The deal, which the companies had signaled in late February, will create a 550-store, $11 billion supermarket chain operating in the New York, New Jersey and Philadelphia areas, as well as in Maryland, Michigan and Louisiana. The combination marks the latest merger in the quickly consolidating grocery-store industry. Last month, Whole Foods Market Inc. WFMI.O said it would buy Wild Oats Markets Inc. OATS.O for $565 million. Traditional grocery chains have grappled with increased competition from larger rivals and the growth of discounters like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) and higher-end gourmet and organic markets like Whole Foods. A&P will pay $9 in cash and 0.12963 share for each Pathmark share. Based on Friday's closing stock price, the deal is worth $469.8 million in cash and $208.8 million in stock, plus the assumption of debt. Pathmark shares were up $1.20, or 10.7 percent, at $12.45 in afternoon Nasdaq trading, while A&P gained $1.29, or 4.2 percent, to $32.15 on the New York Stock Exchange. The deal values Pathmark at about 10 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, analysts said. Including debt, the deal is worth $1.3 billion, the companies said. LONG ANTICIPATED Industry watchers had expected a merger of the two New Jersey-based grocers for several months, and A&P had hinted that it was searching for a deal. As far back as last May, A&P Executive Chairman Christian Haub said his company's improved performance could present the opportunity to participate "in the expected consolidation" of the grocery business. At that time, Haub referred to what he saw as the "inevitable" rationalization of the industry in the Northeast. "Both A&P and Pathmark compete with a wide range of alternate formats in all markets -- but club stores -- including Sam's, Costco ( COST.O ) and BJ's BJ.N -- are the most noteworthy," Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co. analyst Karen Short said in a research report. A&P sees annual cost-savings of $150 million within two years as the combined company eliminates overlapping administrative functions and marketing costs, and gains greater leverage to negotiate better prices with suppliers. Pathmark had been rumored as a possible target or merger candidate for years. In 2005, Yucaipa Cos., a private equity firm owned by billionaire grocery magnate Ronald Burkle, took a stake in the company. A&P's 410 stores include the A&P, Waldbaum's and Food Emporium chains. Pathmark operates its 141 namesake stores in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. The company typically has larger store formats and historically has served lower-income level customers than A&P, analysts said. BRAND NAMES TO STAY To appease antitrust concerns, Short said the two companies might be required to divest about 34 overlapping stores in areas such as Long Island and certain counties in New Jersey. "Both A&P and Pathmark are unprofitable, so we believe each company could present a rational argument to the commission that consolidation must happen in order to return to profitability," Short said. The companies declined to comment on potential store closings, but said they planned to keep all the existing brand names. Under the deal, Tengelmann Group, A&P's majority owner, will be the largest single shareholder of the combined entity. Haub will continue as executive chairman, and A&P President and Chief Executive Eric Claus will keep his post in the combined company. The boards of both companies have unanimously approved the deal, and Yucaipa and Tengelmann have entered into agreements to support the transaction, A&P and Pathmark said. A&P shareholders will control about an 86 percent stake in the combined company, and Pathmark shareholders will hold 14 percent. The deal is expected to close during the second half of A&P's fiscal year, which ends in February. A&P would have to pay Pathmark a $25 million termination fee if the deal gets canceled between September 4 and December 4. The fee would rise to $50 million if the deal gets terminated between December 4 and March 4, 2008, and to $75 million after that, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. For A&P, J.P. Morgan served as financial adviser on the deal. Yucaipa Advisors LLC served as consultants and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. served as financial adviser to Pathmark.
