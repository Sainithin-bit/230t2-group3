 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japanese Financial Services Minister Yuji Yamamoto said on Monday he respects the Tokyo Stock Exchange's decision to maintain Nikko Cordial Corp.'s 8603.T listing on the bourse. 


 "I respect the TSE's decision as I expect it was drawn from a broad perspective," Yamamoto told reporters. The Tokyo Stock Exchange said on Monday it would not delist securities brokerage Nikko Cordial Corp. 8603.T over an accounting scandal, a surprising move after Japanese media reports had said Nikko would lose its listing.
