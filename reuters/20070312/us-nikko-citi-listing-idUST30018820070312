 TOKYO  (Reuters) - The Tokyo Stock Exchange decided on Monday not to strip Nikko Cordial Corp. 8603.T of its share listing over an accounting scandal in a surprise ruling that could weaken Citigroup's ( C.N ) $10.8 billion takeover bid for the brokerage. 


 Citigroup reiterated its intention to acquire Nikko in what would be its biggest-ever deal in Asia and said it would not change its offer of 1,350 yen a share. But the exchange's decision could embolden investors who are unhappy with the price to hold out for a better deal. "If Citigroup really desperately wants Nikko, it may have to offer more of a premium now that the stock will still have liquidity," said Masaki Iso, chief equity officer at Yasuda Asset Management. Shares in Nikko were trading up 5.5 percent at 9.6 euros ($12.6) in Frankfurt 8603.F following the decision, which came after the Japanese market closed. The stock had ended at 1,404 yen in Tokyo, down slightly from Friday but still 4 percent above Citigroup's offer price. The threat of a delisting spooked Nikko's clients and prompted rating agencies to downgrade the firm, dragging the stock to a low of 980 yen on February 1 before reports of Citigroup's interest emerged. Had trading been suspended, investors in Japan's third biggest securities firm would only have been able to unload their shares in the private over-the-counter market, where price information is sketchy and trading volumes are low. The TSE's decision came despite Japanese media reports that bourse officials, who has been reviewing Nikko's status since December, were preparing to kick the company off its trading rolls. Nikko admitted that officials at its merchant banking unit forged documents as part of an effort to inflate profits from an acquisition. The brokerage has already paid a $4.3 million fine and top executives including its former president have quit. "While it's true that more than one person was involved, we couldn't conclude with confidence that the Nikko Cordial group as a whole was to blame," TSE President Taizo Nishimuro told a news conference. "It wasn't enough to expel them from the market." Nikko's shares have been trading above Citigroup's offer price since the acquisition plan was announced last Tuesday, as investors bet that shareholders' price objections, bolstered by a possible reprieve from the TSE, would force the U.S. bank to sweeten its bid. Responding to the TSE's ruling on Monday, Citigroup said in a statement: "We indicated that we had agreed to launch a TOB for 100 percent of Nikko Cordial's shares at 1,350 yen regardless of whether Nikko Cordial's shares are delisted from the Tokyo Stock Exchange. This remains true." Citigroup, which is Nikko's partner in an 8-year-old investment banking venture, said in its initial announcement that it planned to initiate a formal tender offer within a week. Nikko's management has agreed to the deal. A group of North American investment funds that together own about 25 percent of Nikko has complained that Citigroup's offer undervalues the firm by a third or more. That's roughly the gap between the ratio of price to book value implied by Citigoup's offer and the market's valuation of Nikko's two larger rivals, Nomura Holdings Inc. ( 8604.T ) and Daiwa Securities Group Inc. ( 8601.T ). At least part of that gap can be explained by the damage to Nikko's business after the scandal and uncertainty -- now dispelled -- over the TSE's decision. The Osaka Securities Exchange, where Nikko is also traded, said it too would let Nikko remain listed, and the Nikkei publishing company said it would keep the firm in its Nikkei 225 share average  .N225 . That could prompt index-tracking funds that have sold on expectations of a delisting to buy back the stock. "Nikko's stock will likely rally on Tuesday," said Seiichi Suzuki, an analyst at Tokai Tokyo Securities. "Institutional investors and arbitrageurs can be expected to buy back shares, and the market generally should react positively to the news."
