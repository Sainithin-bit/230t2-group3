 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - Independent oil and gas producer Anadarko Petroleum Corp. ( APC.N ) said on Monday it will sell part of its stake in the K2 Unit offshore field in the Gulf of Mexico for $1.2 billion to two unnamed parties. 


 The sale of a 23.2 percent interest in the field, which has average gross production of 37,100 barrels of oil equivalent per day this year, is the latest in a string of deals that Anadarko has undertaken to reduce debt it took on last year with the purchase of two peers. Anadarko, which has a 65 percent interest in K2, said the deal was expected to close in the second quarter and would be effective from January 1, 2007. Dan Pickering, an analyst with Pickering Energy Partners, wrote in a note to clients that the sale was a "positive step" because some on Wall Street thought K2 would not be sold due to uncertainty about its reserves. The Houston-based company will remain as the operator of the field with a 41.8 percent working interest. The sale would bring the proceeds of its divestment program to more than $10 billion since it announced the $22.5 billion purchase last year of Kerr-McGee and Western Gas Resources. "We continue to be very pleased with the pace of, and values realized in, our divestiture program," Anadarko President and Chief Executive Officer Jim Hackett said in a statement. Shares of Anadarko were off 35 cents at $40.31. So far this year, the stock is down about 7 percent.
