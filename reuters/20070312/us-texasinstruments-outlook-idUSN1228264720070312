 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Texas Instruments Inc. TXN.N kept the midpoints of its quarterly profit and revenue forecast unchanged on Monday, disappointing investors who had hoped for an improvement in the chipmaker's outlook. 


 Shares in the world's biggest maker of chips for mobile phones fell as much as 2 percent in extended trading but recovered a bit after executives said customer inventory has improved and growth is likely to resume in the second quarter. The maker of chips for devices from calculators to televisions forecast first-quarter earnings per share of 29 cents to 33 cents from continuing operations, compared with its January target of 28 cents to 34 cents. After an upbeat quarterly financial report from National Semiconductor Inc. ( NSM.N ) last week, investors had been looking to the business update from Dallas, Texas-based TI as a possible catalyst for a broad recovery in chip stocks. "Given National Semiconductor's outlook last week, I think investors were expecting some strength in TI's wireless business," said Robert Burleson, an analyst with ThinkEquity Partners. "If you look at the fact that they basically just narrowed the guidance, some of the optimism that fueled TI's shares since last week is waning," Burleson said. TI also forecast revenue of $3.07 billion to $3.22 billion, compared with its previous range of $3.01 billion to $3.28 billion. GROWTH TO RESUME The midpoints of both earnings and revenue ranges matched those of TI's earlier forecasts as well as Wall Street expectations. Analysts estimated earnings of 31 cents a share on revenue of $3.15 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. "Our order trends are fully consistent with our view that this correction is winding down and, once again, growth should resume in the second quarter," said Ron Slaymaker, an investor relations executive for TI, on a conference call. TI competes with the likes of National Semiconductor, wireless chip company Qualcomm Inc. ( QCOM.O ), and mixed-signal chip makers Analog Devices Inc. ADI.N and Maxim Integrated Products Inc. ( MXIM.O ). "Any time people are looking for something positive and they don't get it, that's clearly a disappointment," said Doug Freedman of American Technology Research. "I think investors should view this as a healthy stability to share prices and take advantage of any near-term pullback." TI also said it expects semiconductor revenue of between $3.01 billion and $3.14 billion, compared with the prior $2.95 billion to $3.20 billion. It backed its earlier target for revenue of $60 million to $80 million for its education unit, which makes calculators. Freedman noted that while Slaymaker did not give specific guidance for the second quarter, he also did not shy from citing the company's 10-year average sequential revenue growth rate of 3 to 4 percent. "He in a way implied the 10-year average probably is applicable," Freedman said. TI shares fell to as low as $31.88 from its close of $32.59 on the New York Stock Exchange. The company has posted disappointing results in the last two quarters, citing falling inventories and growth skewed toward low-priced phones. Its shares have risen 14 percent since January as investors bet on a recovery. (Additional reporting by  Scott Hillis  in San Francisco)
