 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The New York Times Co. ( NYT.N ) board of directors met with leading shareholders in late February, a spokeswoman of the paper confirmed on Monday, amid a fight to cut the Sulzberger family's long-standing control of the company. 


 The board invited Morgan Stanley money manager Hassan Elmasry and another large shareholder, T. Rowe Price Group Inc., to make presentations to its board on February 22, the spokeswoman confirmed. The board extended the invitation even though the company and its controlling Ochs-Sulzberger family have repeatedly rebuffed Elmasry. Elmasry, who controls 7 percent of the company's Class A shares, which have less voting power, has demanded the company dismantle its dual-class share structure that gives the family control of the business. "While we do not comment on what takes place within our board room, we believe in open discussion and dialogue and felt it important for all our Board members to have a chance to hear outside views and thoughts," New York Times spokeswoman Catherine Mathis said in an e-mail. News of the presentations was first reported in the Wall Street Journal on Monday. Elmasry and Dennis Shea, Morgan Stanley Investment Management chief investment officer, delivered their presentation to the board in person on February 22. T. Rowe Price Group made its presentation by phone. A representative for Elmasry was not immediately reachable.
