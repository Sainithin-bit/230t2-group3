 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Boston Scientific Corp. ( BSX.N ), saddled with debt and a depressed share price since buying Guidant Corp., said on Monday it may sell a minority stake in its endosurgery business for more than $1 billion in a public offering. 


 Boston Scientific said it would use the proceeds from the sale of the stake to pay down debt. The endosurgery business makes endoscopy, urology, gynecology and oncology products. The company, which bought Guidant last April for $27 billion, has net debt of $7.2 billion. The endosurgery unit is expected to generate more than $1.4 billion in revenue in 2007. "We don't get credit for it. It's just buried in the cardiovascular company," Boston Scientific Chief Executive Jim Tobin said in an interview. Boston Scientific, with top products including stents to treat clogged arteries and implantable defibrillators to correct irregular heart rhythms, said it is looking at selling about a 20 percent interest in the unit. "It makes sense," Piper Jaffray analyst Thomas Gunderson said of the proposed sale. "It's been discussed off and on for several years and now that they have transformed the business (with the Guidant acquisition and the advent of drug-coated stents) and also are doing everything they can to access capital, this is one of the untapped sources," Gunderson added. The endosurgery business generates about 16 percent of overall company sales and has historic compound annual sales growth of 12 percent. "I don't see any reason why it can't continue to do that," Tobin said. Boston Scientific shares are down about 40 percent since early 2006. Shares of rival medical device maker Medtronic Inc. ( MDT.N ) are down about 15 percent over the same time period. Prior to the announcement on its endosurgery business, Boston Scientific shares fell 61 cents, or 3.9 percent, to close at $15.16 on the New York Stock Exchange.
