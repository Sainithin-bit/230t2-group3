 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales outside the auto sector firmed in February, but were restrained by the housing slump and rising gasoline prices, according to a report published Monday. 


 Sales rose 0.2 percent last month following a 0.5 percent gain in January, said SpendingPulse, the retail data service of MasterCard Advisors. "The housing slowdown is continuing to affect the consumer durables sector, particularly furniture and furnishings," said Michael McNamara, vice president of research and analysis at Mastercard Advisors. Official data from the Commerce Department is due out on Tuesday, and Wall Street analysts expect a 0.3 percent gain. Excluding gasoline and building materials, sales inched just 0.1 percent higher, SpendingPulse said, following a 1.2 percent jump in the prior month. McNamara said he was watching gasoline prices, which toward the end of February were threatening to pass the $2.45 per gallon threshold -- a level above which he says their impact on overall consumption becomes more noticeable.
