 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Applebee's International Inc. APPB.O said on Monday a preliminary review of strategic alternatives would take another six to eight weeks to complete, but added that the restaurant chain does not expect to have a final decision about its future at that time. 


 The news comes days after negotiations with activist investor Breeden Capital Management failed to produce an agreement. Breeden, which has nominated four candidates to the company's 12-member board, last week rejected Applebee's offer of two board seats. Overland Park, Kansas-based Applebee's has been hurt by a pullback in consumer spending and increased competition with other bar-and-grill chains. Profits fell more than 20 percent in 2006. Breeden, which has a 5-percent stake in the chain, has said it wants Applebee's to reduce capital spending, boost cash returned to shareholders and sell more restaurants to franchisees to improve its financial performance. Applebee's said last month it was evaluating alternatives for its business, including a possible sale of the company. In Monday's statement, Applebee's said it "hopes to be in a position to provide shareholders with more information on its thinking" at the end of the preliminary review. On Monday, the company said a committee of five independent directors had spent several months reviewing Applebee's business plan and more recently, had started to evaluate financial strategies. Committee members include Jack Helms, chairman of Minneapolis-based investment banking firm Goldsmith, Agio and Helms, Eric Hansen of Kansas City law firm Holman, Hansen & Colville, Mike Volkema, chairman of furniture maker Herman Miller Inc. ( MLHR.O ), Burton Sack, a former Applebee's franchisee and the company's largest individual shareholder, and Pat Curran, chairman of gel coatings and resins manufacturer Cook Composites and Polymers. "Members of the Strategy Committee and full board are substantial shareholders in their own right, so our work clearly aligns with the best interests of our shareholder base." Helms, Volkema, Sack and former Applebee's Chief Executive Lloyd Hill are the directors who the company will nominate for re-election to the board at the annual meeting this spring, Applebee's said. Applebee's shares fell 9 cents to close at $25.13 on Monday on Nasdaq.
