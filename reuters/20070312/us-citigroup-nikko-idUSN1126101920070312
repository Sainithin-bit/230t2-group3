 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Orbis Investment Management Ltd. said that Citigroup's $10.8 billion bid for Nikko Cordial Corp. 8603.T is too low, joining a chorus of shareholders that separately control about 25 percent of the troubled Japanese brokerage's shares. 


 Orbis, Nikko's second-largest shareholder, said it believes Citigroup's offer of 1,350 yen ($11.41) per share is about two-thirds what the shares are really worth. "Orbis considers the proposed Citigroup offer unacceptable," the firm said in a statement released late Saturday. Investors hoping for a better deal have kept Nikko's shares above Citigroup's offer price since the U.S. banking group unveiled its bid last Tuesday. Nikko's shares rose 3 percent to 1,410 yen on Friday. Three other major shareholders have also objected to the bid price. They include Canadian investment group Mackenzie Financial Corp., Tennessee-based Southeastern Asset Management, and Chicago-based Harris Associates. Orbis values Nikko at 2,000 yen a share, a figure also put forth by Harris and Southeastern. Mackenzie believes Nikko is worth 1,700-1,800 yen a share, Japan's Nikkei business daily reported on Sunday. The report said the head of Mackenzie's Japanese office met with Nikko Cordial President Shoji Kuwashima on Friday to relay their lack of support. Some analysts, though, have said shareholders may choose to sell rather than risk Citigroup walking away at a difficult time for Nikko. Nikko, the third-largest Japanese brokerage, risks losing its stock listing over an accounting scandal at its merchant banking arm. It has admitted to forging documents and booking about $300 million in excess profit over two years. Citi, which already owned 4.9 percent of Nikko, said it plans to boost the brokerage's revenues through such measures as combining Citigroup retail banking and credit card businesses with Nikko's retail brokerage business. Orbis said it holds about 67.5 million Nikko shares, or 6.9 percent of the outstanding stock, which according to Reuters data would make it the second largest shareholder after Harris. Harris owns about 7.5 percent of Nikko shares, while Southeastern owns a roughly 6.6 pct stake. Mackenzie owns a 5.74 percent stake, according to a January regulatory filing.
