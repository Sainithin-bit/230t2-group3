 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Merrill Lynch Global Private Equity MER.N was looking at a possible bid for CanWest Global Communications Corp.'s CGS.TO stake in Australian broadcaster Ten Network Holdings Ltd. ( TEN.AX ), a source familiar with the situation said. 


 Canada's CanWest has a 56.4 percent stake in Ten and had initially hoped to get up to A$2 billion ($1.6 billion) for the holding, but the sale has made slow progress. Ten has a market value of about A$3 billion, including the CanWest stake, based on the latest share price. "Merrill are definitely in that (sale) process," the source told Reuters Monday. The Merrill arm could be one of a number of potential bidders for the television broadcaster, with the Australian Financial Review newspaper reporting on Monday that private equity firms Hellman & Friedman and CCMP Capital Asia were also conducting due diligence on Ten. However, a second source said the newspaper report, which said the three would separately offer about A$2.90 a share each for CanWest's 56.4 percent stake in Ten, was not accurate. A Ten spokeswoman declined to comment. Ten shares fell 1.5 percent to A$3.28 on Monday. They have fallen about 8 percent in the past month. Ten has an enterprise value/earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EV/EBITDA) valuation of 14 to 15, according to analysts. This compares to valuations of 10.3 and 12.5 on rival broadcasters Publishing & Broadcasting Ltd PBL.AX and Seven Network Ltd. SEV.AX when they tipped their media assets into private equity joint ventures. The CanWest sale was set in motion in December when Ten, Australia's third-biggest TV broadcaster, announced it would help CanWest study selling its stake. NO TRADE INTEREST Interested bidders submitted indicative bids last month. However, CanWest failed to attract interest from likely trade buyers such as Macquarie Media MMG.AX, Rupert Murdoch's News Corp NWS.N and John Fairfax Holdings Ltd ( FXJ.AX ). Other Australian newspaper reports on Monday said strict confidentiality agreements and high valuations had deterred other potential bidders. The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper, citing an investment banking source, said CanWest had been forced to relax the conditions on bidders due to a lack of interest. Analysts said Australian privately owned regional TV broadcaster WIN Television was a possible bidder. WIN owner, billionaire Bruce Gordon, upped his stake in Ten to 14 percent last month. "WIN should be the most logical or the keenest of the buyers given their relationship as the regional affiliate. Whether they can cobble together a deal with a partner still might be a bit difficult for them," Shaw Stockbroking analyst Greg Fraser said. Ten said on December 7 that CanWest had agreed that if its stake was sold the buyer would make the same offer for the remaining 43 percent of the company. CanWest is under no obligation to sell its stake at this stage. The broadcaster was once seen as off-limits to buyers but new Australian media ownership laws due to come into force this year have triggered a wave of consolidation in the sector. CanWest is also running a separate sales process for the sale of its stake in New Zealand radio and television group CanWest MediaWorks Ltd. MWL.NZ. Merrill Lynch's private equity arm led a consortium which bought U.S. hospital chain HCA Inc. ( HCA.N ) for US$21 billion last year. In 2005, it led another group which took car rental company Hertz Global Holdings Inc. ( HTZ.N ) private. Ten, Australia's third-biggest TV broadcaster, operates commercial free-to-air licenses in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth, targeting the under-40 age group. CanWest, which has a 14.5 percent voting interest in Ten, has retained Citgroup Global Markets Inc. ( C.N ), while Australian investment advisory firm Gresham is acting for Ten.
