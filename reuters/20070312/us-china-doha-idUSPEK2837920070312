 BEIJING  (Reuters) - The main stumbling block in the Doha Round of global trade talks is the failure of the United States and European Union to make substantial concessions on agriculture, China's commerce minister said on Monday. The World Trade Organization formally relaunched the Doha round of negotiations last month after a six-month suspension that was triggered by differences among major trading partners, especially the United States and EU, over farm subsidies. 


 As a developing country, China had already made more than its share of concessions, and it was not reasonable to ask it to do more, Commerce Minister Bo Xilai told a news conference. "The European Union and the United States, as the world's two largest traders, have yet to make substantial concessions in terms of high import tariffs on agricultural products, export subsidies for agriculture and the huge domestic support for their agricultural products," Bo said. Bo, speaking on the sidelines of the annual session of the National People's Congress, the largely ceremonial parliament, also urged Japan to do more to reduce its tariffs on farm goods, which he said were nearly three times higher than China's. Bo rejected the idea that China was seeking a "free lunch" from the Doha Round, and stressed that play an active, responsible role in the talks. "It is exactly as a Chinese saying goes: 'The crying baby gets the milk first.' It seems that people are gossiping that China is the largest beneficiary so that they can ask China to make more concessions in the talks," he said. Bo said it was still too early to say who would be the biggest beneficiaries of the Doha Round, which was launched in the Qatari capital in 2001. But he said the experience of the past decade showed that rich nations had benefited most from the Uruguay Round, the previous set of negotiations to liberalize global commerce. World leaders have made a renewed effort this year to complete a free trade deal after the talks stalled last year. President George W. Bush said over the weekend that the United States was prepared to reduce its agricultural subsidies but wanted to ensure market access for its products.
