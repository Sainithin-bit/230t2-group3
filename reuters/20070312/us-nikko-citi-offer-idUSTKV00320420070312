 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Citigroup said on Monday that it had no plans to alter the terms of its $10.8 billion bid for Nikko Cordial Corp. even after a surprise decision by the Tokyo Stock Exchange to not delist the brokerage. 


 Citigroup last Tuesday announced its intention to acquire Nikko in what would be its biggest-ever deal in Asia. The U.S. financial conglomerate had said it would launch a tender offer bid for all shares in Nikko at 1,350 yen regardless of whether it lost its stock listing. "This remains true," Citigroup said in a statement, commenting on the terms of its offer. The decision by the TSE on Monday to let Nikko keep its listing came as a surprise to investors following numerous Japanese media reports that bourse officials had decided informally to kick the company off its trading rolls.
