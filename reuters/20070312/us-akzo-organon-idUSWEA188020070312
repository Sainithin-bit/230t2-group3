 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - Schering-Plough Corp SGP.N has agreed to buy Akzo Nobel NV's ( AKZO.AS ) drugs unit Organon BioSciences for 11 billion euros ($14.4 billion) in a bid to gain scale and diversify away from cholesterol medicine. 


 The cash sale, announced on Monday, is a last-minute reversal of Akzo's plans to float Organon on the stock market. The move gets U.S.-based Schering-Plough a near $5 billion-a-year business in women's health, central nervous system drugs and animal medicine, and marks the breakup of one of Europe's last hybrid chemical-pharmaceutical companies. Schering-Plough said the purchase would boost earnings and lead to annual synergies of $500 million within three years. It will finance the deal through a mix of cash, debt and equity. The price is well above the level of up to 9 billion euros analysts had expected Akzo to achieve in an initial public offering (IPO), and shares in Akzo Nobel soared as much as 19 percent to their highest in six years. The value represents 14.6 times 2006 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. Akzo, which will return 1.3 billion euros from the proceeds to shareholders, clinched the deal over the weekend, having just announced on Friday that it intended to list 20-30 percent of Organon on March 27. Schering-Plough shares gained 0.5 percent in early U.S. trade as the firm said the acquisition, which is due to close by the end of 2007, would lift earnings per share by 10 U.S. cents in the first full year. Analysts said the acquisition would help diversify the U.S. drugmaker's business, which is currently heavily dependent on cholesterol-fighting agents, and fill a gap in its late-stage pipeline by adding five drugs in Phase III development. However, Organon's biggest new drug hope, asenapine, remains under a cloud after Pfizer Inc. ( PFE.N ) ended a collaboration on the schizophrenia and bipolar disorder drug last year following mixed clinical trial results. "While still likely approvable, we would question the long-term sales opportunity for this product," Chris Schott of Bank of America said in a note. Organon's established drugs include Puregon for infertility, and NuvaRing and Implanon for contraception. ICI BID SPECULATION Akzo Nobel shares were up 15.1 percent at 53.41 euros by 1500 GMT, after a high of 55.16, compared with a 1.9 percent rise in the DJ Stoxx European chemicals index .SX4P. "The 11 billion euros disposal price for Organon BioSciences is much higher than we and the market anticipated," said analyst Danny van Doesburg at SNS Securities. The deal is the biggest purchase of a Dutch business by a non-Dutch firm or fund, according to Dealogic. Van Doesburg added the disposal would spark speculation Akzo would use the proceeds to buy other chemical companies, such as Britain's largest chemicals firm, Imperial Chemical Industries Plc ICI.L, Valspar ( VAL.N ) and Sherwin-Williams ( SHW.N ). ICI shares rose 6.4 percent to 494 pence. James Knight, an analyst at Collins Stewart, said he now saw a 50 percent chance of an Akzo bid for ICI. Akzo Nobel Chief Executive Hans Wijers declined to comment on ICI, but told reporters in a conference call he would consider both greenfield investments and acquisitions to strengthen its position in the coatings and chemicals sector. "Any transaction that makes strategic sense and that creates long-term value will be considered," Wijers said. He also said he would look into other options of returning cash to shareholders and to optimize its capital structure. Schering-Plough's offer was made a week and a half ago and approved by Akzo Nobel's supervisory board on Sunday, Wijers said. "This is a better way forward for all stakeholders," Wijers said, adding that there would be no "slash and burn" program under the new owner. Schering-Plough Chief Executive Fred Hassan said some jobs would go but losses would be limited. Schering-Plough has experienced a turnaround under Hassan and the veteran dealmaker has made clear his desire to find acquisitions now the company has returned to financial health. He said Schering-Plough would not be looking for other big acquisitions in the near term but would remain open to licensing in specialty pharmaceuticals to boost its portfolio. Analysts had valued Organon at 9 billion euros on a stand-alone basis and 10 billion euros in a trade sale. Organon BioSciences, with 3.7 billion euros in annual revenues, develops and markets prescription drugs, and animal health products. Goldman Sachs was financial adviser to Schering-Plough and Morgan Stanley advised Akzo Nobel. (Additional reporting by  Ben Hirschler  in London)
