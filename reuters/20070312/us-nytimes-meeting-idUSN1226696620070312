 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - In a sign that the New York Times Co. ( NYT.N ) may be trying to appease investors who have criticized it, the newspaper publisher invited Morgan Stanley money manager Hassan Elmasry and another large shareholder, T. Rowe Price Group Inc., to make presentations to its board of directors late last month, The Wall Street Journal reported. 


 The board extended the invitation even though the company and its controlling Ochs-Sulzberger family have repeatedly rebuffed Elmasry, who controls 7 percent of the company's Class A shares.
