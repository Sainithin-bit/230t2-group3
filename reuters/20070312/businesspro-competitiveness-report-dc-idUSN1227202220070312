 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Responding to complaints that the 
United States is losing its edge to foreign markets, a panel 
set up by the nation's biggest business lobby has recommended 
structural changes at the Securities and Exchange Commission, 
the end of quarterly earnings guidance and a boost in the 
nation's retirement savings, The Wall Street Journal reported. 


  The panel, commissioned by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, is 
scheduled to release its report on Monday.  The chamber-backed report, produced by a bipartisan panel 
that began work in 2005, is an effort to identify politically 
palatable ways to boost competitiveness, the Journal said.  The commission's report makes six fairly narrow 
recommendations that it says could be implemented within a 
year, the Journal said.  The Journal said the six recommendations are: changing the 
SEC's structure and approach to regulation; giving the agency 
more authority to exempt certain companies from adhering to the 
Sarbanes-Oxley corporate-reform law; promoting international 
discussion to prevent the type of litigation that led to the 
2002 collapse of Arthur Andersen, one of the nation's biggest 
auditing firms; eliminating quarterly earnings estimates; 
making retirement savings accounts more easily available to 
workers; and making those accounts more portable when workers 
change jobs.
