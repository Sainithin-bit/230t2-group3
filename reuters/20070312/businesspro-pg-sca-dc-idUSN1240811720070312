 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Procter & Gamble Co. ( PG.N ) on 
Monday said it will divest its Western European tissue/towel 
business to SCA ( SCAb.ST ), a global consumer goods and paper 
company. 


  The deal involves the sale of manufacturing assets, P&G's 
Tempo brand in Europe and Hong Kong, and the licensing of 
Charmin & Bounty trademarks in Europe.  Exact timing will depend on the successful completion of 
all regulatory processes in Europe, the consumer products giant 
said.  "This is a strategic choice to focus on continued growth of 
P&G's tissue, towel and facial tissue businesses in the United 
States, Canada, and Mexico led by billion dollar brands Bounty 
and Charmin," said David Taylor, president of P&G's global 
tissue/towel business.
