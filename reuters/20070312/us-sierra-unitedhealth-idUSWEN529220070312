 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Health insurer UnitedHealth Group Inc. ( UNH.N ) said on Monday it will acquire Sierra Health Services Inc. SIE.N for more than $2.4 billion to expand in the fast-growing Las Vegas area and boost its Medicare business. 


 The deal shows UnitedHealth, the largest U.S. health insurer by market value, is continuing to broaden its reach by gobbling up rivals -- and could signal a renewed round of consolidation throughout the sector. Piper Jaffray analyst Melissa Mullikin said Sierra would help UnitedHealth fill a gap in Nevada. "We definitely think it's a positive for (UnitedHealth)," Mullikin said. "That's a really desirable geography." The $43.50 per share deal represents a 21 percent premium over Sierra's closing price of $35.90 on Friday. As of February 23, Sierra had 55.76 million shares outstanding, giving the deal a value of about $2.43 billion. Sierra shares rose $5.66, or 15.8 percent, to $41.56 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares of UnitedHealth, which expects the deal to immediately boost earnings, rose 4 cents to $53.04. Sierra provides health benefits through employers to about 310,000 members in Nevada, virtually all in the Las Vegas area, where Sierra is based. It also offers Medicare plans to about 260,000 members, including 60,000 in a full-service Medicare Advantage plan in Nevada and 200,000 in Medicare plans offering prescription drug coverage in about 30 states. Sierra further has 60,000 members in Nevada enrolled in a Medicaid plan for low-income residents. The combined business in Nevada will continue under Sierra's CEO Anthony Marlon and his management team, UnitedHealth said. "It's a company that doesn't really need any major oversight," said Williams Capital analyst Beth Senko, adding the deal "works financially" for UnitedHealth. UnitedHealth's enrollment in plans that provide broad health benefits was 28.5 million at the end of the year. Its Medicare Part D plans, which provide prescription drug benefits, served 5.74 million members as of the end of the year. After a relatively quiet 2006 for health-insurance deals, analysts have been bracing for more consolidation in the sector as companies seek to expand their reach and improve leverage with providers. "This deal may foreshadow the return of more robust merger activity in the managed care space," J.P. Morgan analyst William Georges wrote in a research note. Georges said Health Net Inc. ( HNT.N ) and Coventry Health Care Inc. CVH.N are potential targets. The Sierra transaction, expected to close by year-end, is subject to state and federal regulatory approvals, including in Nevada, California and Texas, and approval by Sierra stockholders. UnitedHealth expects an earnings gain of about 4 cents a share in the first 12 months, excluding any potential synergies. Analysts expect UnitedHealth to earn $3.42 per share this year, according to Reuters Estimates. Financial synergies are expected to contribute up to $30 million in operating earnings to the combined company in 2008, with additional gains in subsequent years. UnitedHealth reiterated plans to buy back about $4 billion to $4.5 billion in stock in 2007. Minneapolis-based UnitedHealth has been trying to recover from a stock-options scandal and took a big step in that direction last week when it became current again with its U.S. financial filings. UnitedHealth bought PacifiCare Health Systems in 2005 for $9.2 billion, boosting its West Coast presence and bolstering its already substantial Medicare business.
