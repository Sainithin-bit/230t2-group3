 TOKYO  (Reuters) - KDDI Corp. ( 9433.T ), Japan's second-biggest phone company, said on Monday it plans to offer fibre-optic broadband services via cables owned by East Japan Railway Co. ( 9020.T ) to challenge dominant operator Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp. ( 9432.T ). 


 KDDI has bought the fibre-optic business of Tokyo Electric Power Co. Inc. ( 9501.T ) and tied up with cable TV companies to compete with NTT, a former monopoly that is leading the shift to high-speed networks to offer fast video and data transmission. KDDI spokesman Haruhiko Maeda said his company aims to offer services to about 120,000 households, equivalent to about 20 percent of its current 560,000 subscriber base, using JR East cables stretching from Tokyo to northern Japan. But JR East's infrastructure is built along its railway tracks, so additional investment will be needed to connect these cables to individual homes and buildings near the train lines. The Tokyo-based operator plans to offer free television service over broadband as well as high-speed Internet for about 6,000 yen ($50.70) a month. NTT, which already owns a nationwide fibre-optic network, is aiming to expand its subscriber base to 30 million by 2010 from the current 6 million.
