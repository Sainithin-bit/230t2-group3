 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - An investor group backing a $3.4-billion plan to support auto parts maker Delphi Corp.'s DPHIQ.PK emergence from bankruptcy may sell more than 70 percent of its common stock stake to additional investors, one of the group's co-leaders said on Monday. 


 The group led by Appaloosa Management LP and Cerberus Capital Management LP entered an agreement with unidentified additional investors on March 7, Appaloosa said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The agreement calls for additional investors to buy up to 44.9 million shares of Delphi common stock from the group out of a maximum 63-million-share stake of common stock that the investor group could end up with in the deal, it said. Delphi spokeswoman Claudia Piccinin declined to comment on the filing. Representatives from Appaloosa and Cerberus were not immediately available to comment. The Appaloosa-Cerberus led group in December agreed to buy up to $3.4 billion of convertible preferred stock and common stock in exchange for a controlling stake in a reorganized Delphi. The investor group agreed to a minimum $1.4 billion investment, including purchasing 6.3 million shares of common stock and 34.3 million shares of convertible preferred stock at $35 a share. The group also guaranteed an additional $2 billion to support Delphi's emergence by agreeing to buy any shares left over from the parts maker's planned 56.7 million share rights offering to current stockholders. The investment, which the U.S. Bankruptcy Court approved in January, remains contingent on Delphi reaching agreements with its unions and former parent General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ). Delphi, which filed for bankruptcy in October 2005, has outlined plans to cut 21 of 29 U.S. union plants, four-fifths of its U.S. unionized work force and thousands of salaried workers worldwide. It also plans to exit several businesses.
