 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - Dutch chemical distributor Univar NV UNIV.AS said on Monday it is buying U.S. chemicals distributor Chemcentral Corp. for $600 million in cash, including assumed debt, to expand its U.S. operations. 


 Univar shares rose 2.7 percent to a two-week high of 40.43 euros by 0900 GMT. Amsterdam's mid-cap index .AMX was up 0.8 percent. "The acquisition of ChemCentral is an attractive strategic acquisitive step by Univar," Petercam analyst Thijs Berkelder said in a client note, adding it would boost Univar's total revenue by 21 percent. Privately held Chemcentral, based near Chicago, had $1.4 billion in 2006 revenue and distributes specialty and commodity chemicals. The combined company would have posted $8 billion in revenue in 2006, Univar said in a statement. "Chemcentral brings to our combined organization a diverse customer base in North America with a complementary product set that provides significant opportunities for cross-selling amongst our respective customer bases," Univar Chief Executive Gary Pruitt said in a statement. Univar is paying for the acquisition with a $1.5 billion syndicated credit facility underwritten by ABN AMRO N.V., Bank of America Securities Limited and Citigroup Global Markets Limited.
