 LONDON  (Reuters) - Schering-Plough SGP.N will cut some jobs after acquiring Akzo Nobel's ( AKZO.AS ) drugs unit, Organon BioSciences, but staff reductions will be limited, the chief executive of the U.S. group said on Monday. 


 "This is really a growth-orientated merger," Fred Hassan told reporters in a conference call. "There will be some reductions, because that is normal in these big combinations, but that's not the main focus." He declined to give figures. Akzo Chief Executive Hans Wijers, who agreed to sell the business to Schering-Plough at the weekend for 11 billion euros ($14.5 billion), also said there would be no "slash and burn" under the new owner.
