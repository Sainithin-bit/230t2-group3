 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A New Jersey jury on Monday ordered Merck & Co. ( MRK.N ) to pay $27.5 million in punitive damages after finding that the drugmaker was willful and reckless in promoting arthritis medicine Vioxx, which has since been withdrawn. 


 The jury in Atlantic City earlier in the day found that Vioxx was a primary cause of plaintiff Frederick Humeston's 2001 heart attack and awarded $20 million in compensatory damages -- $18 million to Humeston and $2 million to his wife.
