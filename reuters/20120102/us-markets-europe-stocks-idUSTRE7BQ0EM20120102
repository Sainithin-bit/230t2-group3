 PARIS  (Reuters) - European stocks ended higher in their first trading session of the year on Monday, led by defensive utilities such as E.ON ( EONGn.DE ) and GDF Suez ( GSZ.PA ), while volumes were anaemic as UK and U.S. markets remained closed for the New Year holiday. 
 The FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of top European shares provisionally closed 1 percent higher at 1,011.14 points, the index's highest close in two months, with investors shrugging off gloomy data from the euro zone showing the region's manufacturing activity declining for a fifth straight month in December. A number of traders and analysts, however, warned about the risk of hangover from the brisk two-week Christmas rally when most investors come back to work later in the week. "The odds for a post-party headache will indeed be high," Saxo Bank trading advisor Didier Abbato said. "The bad news is that Santa did not deliver on a quick fix solution to Europe's financial troubles." The STOXX 600 utility index .SX6P, one of the worst performers among European sectors in 2011 with a loss of 17 percent for the year, paced the gains on Monday, up 2.2 percent, with E.ON up 4.2 percent and GDF Suez up 2.9 percent.
