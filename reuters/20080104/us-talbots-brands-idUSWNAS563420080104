 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Apparel retailer Talbots Inc TLB.N said on Friday it will exit its Talbots Kids and Mens lines and warned of weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter sales, sending shares down 7 percent in morning trading. 

 But the company stopped short of cutting its fourth-quarter sales and earnings forecasts, noting that the important month of January -- when people redeem gift cards received for the holidays -- still has several weeks left. Talbots, which is trying to focus on improving its core women's business, which has struggled for some time, said it will close 66 Talbots Kids and 12 Talbots Mens stores, cutting about 800 full- and part-time jobs, or about 5 percent of its work force. The closures should be completed by September, and are expected to reduce annualized revenue by about $100 million. But the company expects operational benefits of about $13 million to $15 million a year due to the closures. The decision to exit the kids' and men's business is part of a strategic review announced in October by Chief Executive Trudy Sullivan, a former Liz Claiborne Inc LIZ.N president who took over in August with the aim of turning Talbots around and luring back its core shopper -- women over 35. Changes in women's fashion tastes, an economic slowdown and a recent improvement at many department stores have all been especially painful for specialty chains that cater to mature women, such as Talbots, Chico's FAS Inc ( CHS.N ), Coldwater Creek Inc ( CWTR.O ) and AnnTaylor Stores Corp  ( ANN.N ). Talbots said on Friday that sales at its namesake and J. Jill chains are trending below expectations so far in the fourth quarter, which contains the key holiday shopping period. Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co analyst Adrienne Tennant said in a research note on Friday that "the entire 'missy' sector has had a very challenging holiday season as the missy shopper remains reluctant to spend." Unlike teenagers, who are more susceptible to peer pressure and have continued to shop for their favorite brands despite higher gasoline prices and fears of recession, mature women seem to have slowed down. "Promotions were deep and broad across the entire missy sector and we believe Talbots was forced to promote to keep pace with other missy retailers' promotional levels," Tennant said. But gift cards, which are becoming increasingly popular gift items, effectively extend the holiday shopping period for retailers, who do not count the cards' revenue until they are redeemed. Talbots said it will record a pretax asset impairment charge of $5 million, or 6 cents per share, in the fourth quarter. It expects additional expenses of $34 million to $42 million, or 40 cents to 49 cents a share, in fiscal 2008 related lease liabilities and asset impairment. For the fourth quarter, analysts on average were expecting revenue of $621.6 million and a net loss of 8 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Talbots shares, which have lost 54 percent over the last year through Thursday's close, fell an additional 7 percent, or 75 cents, to $9.93 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday.
