 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Sirius Satellite Radio ( SIRI.O ) ended 2007 with more than 8.3 million subscribers, a 38 percent rise that met its target for the year. 

 Sirius, in a statement released late on Thursday, added about 2.3 million net subscribers in the year, and its gross subscriber additions were the highest in the history of satellite radio. "Based upon preliminary financial data, we expect to report significantly greater positive free cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2007 than the company reported in the fourth quarter of 2006," said Mel Karmazin, chief executive of Sirius, in a statement on Thursday. Last February, Sirius, which is in the process of acquiring rival XM Satellite Radio Holding XMSR.O, said it expected in 2007 to add 2 million customers to bring its total to "more than 8 million." By contrast, XM has previously said it would end 2007 with 9.0 million to 9.2 million subscribers. (Reporting by  Franklin Paul ; Editing by  Derek Caney )
