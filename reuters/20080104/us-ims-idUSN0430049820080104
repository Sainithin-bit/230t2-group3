 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - IMS Health Inc RX.N said on Friday it will cut 10 percent of its work force, or about 1,050 jobs, as part of a cost-cutting plan and take a pretax charge of $86 million to $90 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. 

 IMS said the restructuring "in response to healthcare marketplace dynamics" is expected to be complete by the end of 2008. Once the program is implemented, IMS expects to generate $55 million to $60 million in annual savings, beginning in 2009. The Norwalk, Connecticut, company, which provides market data on prescription drug sales, said in a statement the action will accelerate IMS's operational efficiencies globally and improve profitability, especially in Europe. "With these actions, we are positioning ourselves to reflect market realities and are adjusting our cost structure - aiming for greater simplicity, fewer management layers, faster decision making, and a sharper focus on addressing clients' new priorities," IMS Chief Executive David Carlucci said in a statement. Many of IMS's customers in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors are undergoing major restructurings of their own to bring down costs and address slowing sales, including thousands of job cuts in the industry. "We expect worsening industry conditions for IMS Health customers in the near term," Morgan Stanley analyst David Veal said in a research note. "As such, we believe the fundamental outlook is likely to face greater headwinds than is currently reflected in consensus estimates." Veal, who has an "equal-weight" rating on IMS shares added, "IMS will need to rely on acquisitions, cost-cutting and share buybacks to achieve high single-digit earnings growth in 2008." IMS shares were off 42 cents, or nearly 2 percent, at $22.05 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by  Bill Berkrot  and  Debra Sherman ; Editing by Gerald E.
