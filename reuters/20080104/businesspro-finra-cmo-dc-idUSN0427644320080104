 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Securities regulators are probing 
several brokerage firms dealing with collateralized mortgage 
obligations, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday. 

  The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Wall Street's 
self-regulatory body, sent letters to brokerages last month 
inquiring about the marketing and sales of mortgage-related 
products, the report said.  The report cited a letter, dated December 14. The letter 
suggested regulators were investigating whether brokers sold 
the products to individuals just as the market for related 
products was collapsing, it said.  It was unclear which brokerages received the letter, and 
the investigation was a "sweep" investigation which does not 
necessarily result in an enforcement action, the report said.  (Editing by Erica Billingham)
