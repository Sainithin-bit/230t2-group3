 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Mortgage and vehicle fleet company PHH Corp ( PHH.N ) said on Friday it received a $50 million termination fee from Blackstone Capital Partners, a fund affiliated with buyout firm Blackstone Group ( BX.N ), after a deal to buy the company fell apart. 

 PHH said on Tuesday it terminated its nearly $2 billion sale to General Electric Co ( GE.N ) and Blackstone, after the private equity firm failed to obtain required financing for the deal. PHH said at the time it requested a termination fee of $50 million from the Blackstone Group. PHH also said on Friday it agreed to pay up to $4.5 million to cover fees charged by consultants that Blackstone retained in connection with the failed deal. GE and the Blackstone Group had agreed in March to acquire PHH for $1.8 billion. Under the terms, GE would have retained PHH's vehicle fleet company PHH Arval and would have sold PHH Mortgage to Blackstone. PHH shares closed on Friday at $15.98, down 87 cents on the New York Stock Exchange. In March, the GE and Blackstone deal valued the company at $31.50 per share, and PHH stock had traded as high as $31.52 in July. The deal termination follows turmoil in the credit markets, which has made financing of leveraged buyouts (LBOs) much more difficult. (Reporting by  Megan Davies ; editing by Carol Bishopric)
