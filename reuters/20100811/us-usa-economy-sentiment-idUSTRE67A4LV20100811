 WHAT: Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's Surveys of Consumers preliminary reading on August consumer sentiment 

 WHEN: Friday at 9:55 a.m. (1355 GMT) REUTERS FORECAST: * Sentiment index is expected to inch up to 69.3 in August from 67.8 in July. Forecasts range from 64.0 to 74.0. * Current economic conditions gauge is seen unchanged from July at 76.5. Forecasts range from 75.0 to 78.0. * Barometer of consumer expectations is seen up at 63.7. It ended July at 62.3. Forecasts range from 59.8 to 68.0. FACTORS TO WATCH: While expectations are for a slight pickup in sentiment from the previous month, sentiment sagged in July to its lowest level since November on bleak prospects for jobs and income. The survey's final July reading on the overall index on consumer sentiment dropped to 67.8 from 76.O in June. Analysts say those employment concerns likely remain for consumers as July data on monthly payrolls from the U.S. government was weaker than expected. It also added to a slew of other data that underscored the view the recovery is slowing. Employment levels are considered significant to boosting consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. The Federal Reserve, too, on Tuesday gave a gloomier economic outlook. "(Sentiment) has been steadily weak, and I think with the (stock) market down in May and June, I don't see much in terms of an uptick in prospects for consumer confidence. Obviously, 70 percent of (the economy's) growth is based on the consumer so that's another definite headwind," said Alan Lancz, president, Alan B. Lancz & Associates Inc., an investment advisory firm, based in Toledo, Ohio. The Standard & Poor's 500 index  .SPX  was down 8.2 percent in May and down 5.4 percent in June. The index jumped 6.9 percent in July, but is down more than 1 percent so far for August. In another reading of sentiment, the Conference Board, an industry group, said late last month its index of consumer attitudes fell to 50.4 in July from a revised 54.3 in June The June reading was revised up from an original 52.9.. MARKET IMPACT: A better-than-expected consumer sentiment number could lift stocks, which were in negative territory for the year on Wednesday amid increased worries about the recovery, while it would hurt the safe-haven demand for U.S. government bonds. An above-forecast report would likely be supportive for the U.S. dollar. (Reporting by  Caroline Valetkevitch , Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
