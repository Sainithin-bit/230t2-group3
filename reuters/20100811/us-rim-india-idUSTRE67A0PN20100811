 NEW DELHI  (Reuters) - India may decide to temporarily shut down BlackBerry Messenger and email services if Research In Motion does not address security concerns in a meeting to be held between the government and operators on Thursday, government officials said. 

 India's home (interior) ministry will press for some deadline to be fixed for RIM to share encryption details when government officials meet telecom operators on Thursday. India says the Canadian smartphone maker's BlackBerry services could be misused by militants as security agencies cannot access the messages sent through these services.
