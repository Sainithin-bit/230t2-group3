 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Automaker General Motors Co has finalized its $5 billion credit facility and plans to file for its initial public offering on Friday, according to sources familiar with the situation. 

 The credit facility has a tiered structure, with commitment levels at $500 million, $300 million, and below. Major U.S. banks including Bank of America Corp, Citigroup Inc, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley have committed to the credit facility at the $500 million level, one source said. The total GM IPO will represent at least one quarter of the company, the source said, but added that Friday's filing will be for a nominal amount, below the eventual amount to be raised. When GM is ready to begin, it will start by trying to sell about $10 billion worth of shares and work up from there, the source said. GM's debut is likely before Thanksgiving, but the timing does not hinge on U.S. elections, the source said. A Dutch auction-style IPO is unlikely, three sources said. All the sources asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak publicly. (Reporting by  Clare Baldwin  and  Soyoung Kim , editing by Leslie Gevirtz)
