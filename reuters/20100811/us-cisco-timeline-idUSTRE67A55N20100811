 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc ( CSCO.O ) Chief Executive John Chambers said there was "unusual uncertainty" in the economy and gave a revenue forecast that was below Wall Street expectations, sending shares tumbling. 

 Chambers, one of Silicon Valley's longest-serving executives, is considered a good reader of industry trends. He was one of the first executives to flag the impact of the financial meltdown on the technology sector in late 2007. Here are some of Chambers' comments in recent years. AUG 2007 "I have been in this business for 30 years ... It's the strongest global economy I have been a part of." NOV 2007 Chambers warned of "dramatic decreases" in orders from U.S. banks. FEB 2008 Chambers said orders slowed rapidly from December to January in the United States and Europe. "It's the most cautious I've seen CEOs in the U.S. and Europe in many years." MAY 2009 On customer sentiment: "You can call it stability, you can call it leveling out ... for the first time many of them feel something solid beneath their feet as opposed to going into deeper and deeper water." FEB 2010 "In our opinion Q2 marked the second phase of the recovery with additional across-the-board acceleration -- in other words, balance across the board -- in all of our geographies and market segments." MAY 2010 "Given all the uncertainties regarding the strength and shape of the recovery, concerns about the recovery possibly slowing and the unknown extent of job creation, we encourage you to wait for additional economic data before becoming too optimistic." AUGUST 2010 "We are seeing a large number of mixed signals in both the market and from our customers' expectations, and we think the words 'unusual uncertainty' are an accurate description of what is occurring."
