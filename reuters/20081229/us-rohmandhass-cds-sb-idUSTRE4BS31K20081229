 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The cost of protecting debt issued by chemicals company Rohm & Haas ROH.N against potential default rose sharply on Monday on uncertainty about Dow Chemical completing its acquisition of the company. 

 Kuwait at the weekend reversed its decision to approve a purchase of a 50 percent stake in Dow Chemical's ( DOW.N ) plastics-making unit. Dow Chemical was planning to use the proceeds from that deal to fund its purchase of Rohm & Haas. Five-year credit default swaps on Rohm & Haas debt were trading at 175 basis points, or $175,000 to insure $10 million of debt for five years, according to Phoenix Partners. That was up from 95 basis points on Dec 17, the last time the contract traded. (Reporting by  Ciara Linnane ; Editing by  Chizu Nomiyama )
