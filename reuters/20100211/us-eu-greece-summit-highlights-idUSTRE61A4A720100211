 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - The following are comments by European Union leaders in connection with their summit in Brussels on Thursday at which they said they were ready to support debt-stricken Greece. 

 GREEK PRIME MINISTER GEORGE PAPANDREOU "I must say our government has proved that we are determined to regain this lost credibility." EUROGROUP CHAIRMAN JEAN-CLAUDE JUNCKER On possible aid for Greece: "It is not money for nothing. It is money on the condition that we would have taken all the drastic measures ... A euro bond is not at our disposal. "In the case that we would have to have this coordinated action we know what kind of instrument we would have to use." GERMAN CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL "We have sent a very clear political signal today, but it is also up to Greece to fulfill its requirements ... For me, it is important that the ECB and the (European) Commission set out the path to follow and that all EU state heads support this. This will make it clear that it is a strong bloc, even if one member is weaker for a while." "The European Central Bank and Commission's request, for Greece to lower its deficit by 4 percent, is adequate and correct. Greece will do everything to achieve its targets. There will be a common review of the situation in March, and Greece is prepared to undertake extra measures then if necessary." "We know our responsibility for the stability of the euro zone and we belong together. Rules have to be respected, however. Greece did not ask us for any money today." "We have a duty to contribute to stronger coordination. No country can be alone." "Greece did not look for financial support, but said it was ready to carry out its programme ... That is the best message that is possible." EUROGROUP CHAIRMAN JEAN-CLAUDE JUNCKER On whether Greece could leave euro zone: "It is totally out of the question. It is absurd." FRENCH PRESIDENT NICOLAS SARKOZY "We have delivered a very clear political signal: Greece is part of the European Union, of the euro zone, and we will support it." "Greece is not alone and Greece has decided to make efforts of its own ... Greece has not asked for any financial help at all from the European Union." EUROPEAN COMMISSION PRESIDENT JOSE MANUEL BARROSO "The question of pledges (to Greece) was not raised because the Greek government has not requested any financial support, which means the Greek government believe they do not need this financial support, that is why I think we should not now speculate about scenarios that are so far not present." "As the former Belgian prime minister (EU President Herman Van Rompuy) said, you have to deal with problems when they occur." EUROPEAN UNION PRESIDENT HERMAN VAN ROMPUY On Greece: "Greece. That's the only topic we mentioned. This concerns Greece and only Greece." "There was no debate on sanctions this afternoon." "It is a very clear political message in which we ask the Greek government to accept greater responsibility." "It is also a clear message of solidarity within the euro zone should this be necessary." "I believe this is very clear, there is clear political will." On coordination: "There really has to be far stronger coordination at a macroeconomic level so as to avoid the situation such as we have ... now and it's also important that there is far stronger coordination in terms of ... strategy." "That's why I put forward these proposals as regards governance ... some placed a lot of emphasis on this as well." "As the European Union we also need more weight ... We also need more weight when it comes to the decision-making in worldwide institutions." EUROPEAN COMMISSION PRESIDENT JOSE MANUEL BARROSO "Our priorities should be to chart a way out of the crisis while building a new economic model, a sustainable, inclusive, competitive, social market economy for Europe. "We have the institutions to make it happen. After our discussions today I am confident Europe also has the political will." "I really welcome the spirit I saw today in the European Council." "First of all we have decided -- the statement which is available to you shows our confidence in Greece and the euro zone. I believe it is important to have this strong commitment from all heads of state and government regarding our euro zone and regarding the situation that is being faced by one specific member of our union. I can tell you that I saw a clear determination to act." EUROPEAN UNION PRESIDENT HERMAN VAN ROMPUY "We reached agreement fairly easily. We agreed to a text." "This agreement is an expression of clear political will and it is a political message. This political message has a responsibility dimension to it. The Greek government has a responsibility in terms of recovery, its public finances. But it also reflects a ... commitment to make solidarity, if the need were to arise. It is not necessarily today." GERMAN CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL "We have sent a very clear political signal today, but it is also up to Greece to fulfill its requirements." "We will stand ready to support Greece, but it must act too."
