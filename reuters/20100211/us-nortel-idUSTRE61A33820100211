 (Reuters) - Bankrupt Nortel Networks Corp ( NRTLQ.PK ) said it was expecting about $1 billion more from the sale of some of its remaining businesses, including the Optical Networking and Carrier Ethernet service. 

 The company said it had generated about $2 billion through completion of earlier sale transactions. Nortel said it was seeking court approval for a plan aimed at retaining key staff to complete work related to the recovery of its accounts receivables, inventory and real-estate assets. Once North America's biggest telecommunications equipment maker, Nortel filed for bankruptcy January 2009. It is auctioning off its assets in an effort to pay back debtholders, rather than restructuring the business. Nortel has already sold its fiber optic and ethernet businesses to Ciena ( CIEN.O ) and wireless assets to Ericsson ( ERICb.ST ). (Reporting by Ashutosh Joshi in Bangalore; Editing by Vinu Pilakkott)
