 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Air Products and Chemicals Inc ( APD.N ) took its $5.1 billion bid for rival Airgas Inc ( ARG.N ) hostile on Thursday by launching a tender offer for Airgas shares. 

 The move, which was widely expected, is designed to exert pressure on the Airgas board and force the company to the bargaining table. Going hostile also lets Air Products commence the regulatory approval process. At stake is the top position in the North American industrial gas market, which is poised to rebound once the recession abates. Air Products offered $60 per share cash last week for Airgas. The deal also includes about $1.9 billion in debt. Radnor, Pennsylvania-based Airgas rejected that bid on Tuesday, saying it was far too low. It had already rejected two previous bids from Air Products. "This continuing refusal to discuss our compelling all-cash premium offer has left us with no alternative but to take the offer directly to Airgas shareholders," Air Products said in a statement. Airgas said on Thursday it would review the tender offer and formulate a response within 10 business days. The company advised its shareholders to do nothing. Regardless, Allentown, Pennsylvania-based Air Products will have a tough time reaching its goal. Under the terms of a "poison pill" shareholder rights plan, no investor can acquire more than 15 percent of Airgas shares without the board's approval. Airgas last updated its poison pill plan in 2007, according to FactSet SharkRepellent. Air Products said its tender offer is contingent on Airgas' board canceling that plan, something it is unlikely to do. Airgas also has a staggered board of nine members, meaning that Air Products would have a hard time changing the makeup of the board quickly since only one-third of the board is up for election in a given year. One weakness, though, may be a stipulation in Airgas' bylaws that allows for only 33 percent of shareholders to call for a special shareholder meeting. If it is able to convince enough shareholders to call a meeting, that could give Air Products the ability to change the bylaws in its favor. REACTION The hostile move provoked little surprise on Wall Street, where shares of both companies barely moved and investors appeared to be waiting for the next step in the saga. "It was only a matter of time before Air Products put together its presentation for Airgas shareholders," Morningstar analyst Basili Alukos told Reuters. A tender offer is an offer to purchase all outstanding existing shares of a corporation. Airgas Chief Executive Peter McCausland owns about 6.9 million shares, or about 10 percent of the company. Air Products owns about 1.5 million shares. Air Products' tender offer will expire at midnight EST on April 9, 2010. Meanwhile, Airgas is suing to stop the law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore from representing Air Products in the deal, saying that Cravath worked for Airgas up until recently and would have a conflict of interest. In a separate suit, Air Products is hoping to force Airgas to form a board committee to consider the deal. In midday trading, shares of Airgas were up 10 cents at $61.41 while shares of Air Products were up 39 cents at    $68.61.
