 PARIS  (Reuters) - Eurogroup finance ministers have discussed aid for Greece but not yet come to an agreement and an announcement at the EU summit in Brussels on Thursday is unlikely, a French diplomatic source said on Wednesday. 

 The summit would not necessarily be easy and France believes EU countries should make a show of solidarity, the source said. "I regret that we are not in a position to play in harmony tomorrow ... We are faced with a challenge. We don't know how things will go tomorrow," the source told journalists. France is working with Germany on a joint declaration of political support for Greece, whose problems are having increasingly global repercussions, the source added. "We are worried in particular because it seems the situation is progressively turning from simple tension over Greek interest rates linked to bad management of the country into another, global dimension," the source said. "Markets as a whole are affected by what is happening in Greece -- the euro, equities markets," the source said. The source added that France wants the European Union to deliver a message to support to Greece, who must show that it is determined to rigorously apply the measures it has announced. France also thinks the European Union, not the International Monetary Fund, should deal with the Greek problem, the source said. "The first responsibility in the management of this problem should go to the European Union and not to institutions such as the IMF," the source said, adding that the latter could lend its expertise but should be subordinate to decisions made by the EU.
