 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - Euro zone states have started secretly preparing for an extension of the maturity of Greek debt alongside the setting up of an independent institution to sell Greek state assets, a Dutch newspaper reported on Tuesday. 

 Newspaper Het Financieele Dagblad reported, citing sources in Brussels, that public servants from euro zone states are already working on the technical preparations for a light form of Greek debt restructuring via "reprofiling" -- such as a short extension of Greek debt maturities. Dutch Finance Minister Jan Kees de Jager was quoted as saying by the paper that reprofiling of Greece's debt is a "serious option" but only as a possible final piece in a "total package." De Jager said Greece should first fulfill its promises over reforms, but he also argued for a form of reprofiling in which private investors would remain involved to avoid the necessity for a 'credit event', the paper cited him as saying. This could take place via a voluntary extension of the debt maturities by a maximum of three years, the paper said. The Dutch finance ministry was not immediately available to comment on the report. The Dutch newspaper also said euro zone countries are considering a suggestion from De Jager to take the privatization process of Greek assets out of the hands of the Greek government and to hand it over to an independent organization. De Jager proposed the idea of a privatization body last week to his European counterparts and Juncker also supported this idea over the weekend.
