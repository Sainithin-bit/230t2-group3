 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks dipped in light volume on Tuesday as lingering concerns about a slowdown in growth more than offset gains in energy shares. 

 Investors kept trimming large-cap technology positions, pushing the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite lower. The S&P's energy sector index .GSPE rose 1.3 percent, while its industrials index .GSPI slipped 0.6 percent, sending the market down for a second day. Sectors associated with cyclical growth have suffered recently, with industrials down more than 5 percent so far this month. "I don't see any strong positive momentum," said Kim Caughey Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. The S&P 500 closed at its lowest level in over a month and ended below its 50-day moving average for a second straight day. The 50-day MA, now at 1,324.59, could turn into a hurdle for the benchmark to reestablish a strong uptrend. Occidental Petroleum ( OXY.N ), rose 3.6 percent to $102.50, while Joy Global JOYG.O fell 1.8 percent to $85.96. Following much weaker-than-expected New York and Philadelphia Fed manufacturing surveys last week, the Richmond Fed survey showed on Tuesday that manufacturing in the central Atlantic region stalled in May after expanding for seven months. "We don't really have jobs strengthening. We have the economic indicators getting softer and we're heading into the summer," Forrest said. Energy shares were helped by a near 2 percent rise in U.S. and Brent crude futures. Oil rallied after Goldman Sachs raised its forecast price for the commodity and as the euro erased some of the previous day's losses. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  lost 25.05 points, or 0.20 percent, to 12,356.21. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  dropped 1.09 points, or 0.08 percent, to 1,316.28. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  fell 12.74 points, or 0.46 percent, to 2,746.16. Gold miners' stocks advanced as bullion rose to its highest in about three weeks on concerns about a spreading debt crisis in the euro zone. Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc ( FCX.N ) gained 3 percent to $48.82. Volume was light, with roughly 6.6 billion shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, NYSE Amex and Nasdaq, below last year's estimated daily average of 8.47 billion. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a ratio of about 8 to 7, while on the Nasdaq, about eight stocks fell for every five that rose. Shares of Russian Internet company Yandex NV ( YNDX.O ) surged as much as 68 percent in their debut to a session peak at $42.01, in the largest U.S. initial public offering in the Internet sector since Google Inc ( GOOG.O ). Yandex raised $1.3 billion in its IPO on Monday by selling 52.2 million shares for $25 each. The offering valued the company at about $8 billion. Yandex shares closed at $38.84 -- up 55.4 percent. American International Group Inc ( AIG.N ) priced shares in its sale at $29 each, according to a source familiar with the situation. For details, see [ID:nN24282319]. AIG and the U.S. Treasury sold 300 million shares, raising about $8.7 billion, according to the source. For Treasury to break even on its investment when it bailed out AIG during the financial crisis, it needs to sell its 1.7 billion shares for an average price of $28.72. AIG shares last traded down 1.05 percent at $29.15 after hours. (Reporting by Rodrigo Campos; Additional reporting by  Clare Baldwin ; Editing by  Jan Paschal )
