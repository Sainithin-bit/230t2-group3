 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil futures bounced $2 on Tuesday on raised price outlooks from Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley and ahead of weekly oil inventory reports expected show crude stockpiles fell last week in the United States. 

 A weaker dollar added support for dollar-denominated oil prices. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the July crude contract rose $1.90, or 1.9 percent, to $99.60 a barrel by 9:15 a.m. EDT (1315 GMT), trading from $96.61 to $99.82. (Reporting by  Robert Gibbons ; Editing by John Picinich)
