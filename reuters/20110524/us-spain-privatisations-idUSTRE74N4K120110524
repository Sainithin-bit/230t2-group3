 MADRID  (Reuters) - Spain's plans to raise extra revenue from sales of state assets face substantial legal and political obstacles but their execution would cut the debt-laden country's borrowing needs for the rest of 2011. 

 Madrid's drive to assure markets it can manage its debt burden and avoid a bailout like neighboring Portugal's includes plans to sell stakes worth a total 15 to 20 billion euros ($21 to $29 billion) in its airports and money-spinning lottery business. If successful, the sales could reduce the amount Spain needs to borrow before year-end -- around 52 billion euros of medium and long-term debt -- by up to 40 percent. That should go some way to placating markets that want tough structural moves to tackle Spain's debt and deficits and which have been unnerved by talk of a Greek default or restructuring and signs the euro zone debt crisis may be spreading. The premium demanded by investors to hold Spanish over German debt leapt to five-month highs on Monday, after the government took a hammering in local elections and credit rating agencies added to worries about other indebted euro zone states. "For this year, it's fair to assume that the crisis will still be here, so 15 billion euros as a one-off could indeed make quite a difference," said David Schnautz, debt strategist at Commerzbank. But problems abound for the Socialist government in successfully steering asset sales through before its term ends next Spring, with regions vying for control of their airports and legal obstacles still to be passed. REGIONAL CONFLICT? Spain's 17 powerful regions could prove a major hurdle for the government with many likely to push for a clear say in the Privatization process or even running of the airports. Spain launched a tender for investment banks to bid to manage the Privatization of a 49 percent stake in airport operator AENA in May, with the sale to be followed by that of the country's biggest airports. "There might be pressure to sell them to get the money, but there is more tension among the regions to get involved in the planning and operation of the airports, which could complicate it all," said Frederic Sabria at IESE business school who has worked with AENA in the past. Some analysts said the government was likely to give Catalonia, home to the country's second largest airport in Barcelona, a supervisory role after it said it would fight Madrid for more control. Germa Bel, economist and expert in airports at the University of Barcelona said the government would force through the sale of stakes in the airports this year. "The market is so bad right now for this type of operation so they are going to sell cheap, that can be taken for granted." While the airport business might earn the government more, the real jewel in Spain's Privatization crown is a stake in its lottery business, famous for the world's largest Christmas time payout, known as 'El Gordo' (The Fat One). According to a report on Tuesday the government will choose three advisors next week with a view to listing the state lottery on the stock exchange in October, even if analysts have concerns about the government meeting its schedule given a long Spanish summer and new regulations yet to be passed. But a banking source said the risks are remote, while the lottery business is a "cash cow" paying huge dividends and so will attract fierce competition. The business could fetch 6.5 billion to 7.5 billion euros. BORROWING IMPACT Credit rating agency Moody's Investors Service said this month that Spain's asset sale plans were intended to show markets it was trying to cut its debt, but that likely receipts would not be enough to change the country's debt metrics. Privatization revenues at the lower end of expectations would take only about 10 percent of total planned issuance off the table this year. But if the sales netted the top estimate of 20 billion euros, Spain could slash about 40 percent from its planned medium and long-term debt issuance for the rest of this year. Spain's Treasury has already raised 41.2 billion euros this year, or 44.5 percent of its planned issuance, at higher yields than last year although Moody's said the rise in debt funding costs did not threaten the country's Aa2 rating. Asset sales would have no impact on the country's budget deficit -- targeted at 6 percent of gross domestic product in 2011 -- as Eurostat rules prevent the inclusion of Privatization revenues in the public accounts. The privatizations also form part of Spain's Stability Program, submitted to the European Union, which details how through fiscal consolidation and structural reforms the economy will return to health. Complicated Privatization plans may need to be more than just straight sell-offs to convince analysts they will help boost Spain's fragile economic growth, however. "If the privatizations are done without plans to show how they will improve productivity in the economy then I'm not sure it will be a good sign to markets," said Luca Cazzulani, deputy head of fixed income at UniCredit.
