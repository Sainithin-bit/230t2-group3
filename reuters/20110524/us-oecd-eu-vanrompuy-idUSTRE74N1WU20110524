 PARIS  (Reuters) - A restructuring of Greece's debt would make the euro zone crisis worse, not better, European Council President Herman Van Rompuy said on Tuesday, insisting that the EU was determined to avert default. The three major credit rating agencies have warned that any attempt to ease Greece's obligations to its bondholders would constitute a default. Portugal and Ireland would be at risk of multi-notch credit downgrades, pushing their ratings into junk territory in the event of a default by Greece, Moody's EMEA chief credit officer told Reuters on Tuesday. 

 "There is a real danger that in one form or another a debt restructuring or rescheduling aggravates the situation," Van Rompuy told a forum at the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development in Paris. "The risk of failure in such an operation is huge." Van Rompuy said the "red lines" were to avoid a default and a credit event -- meaning anything that could trigger the payout of sovereign default insurance. "That's why the emphasis has continued to be on continuing to implement the tough but necessary reforms," he said. Markets piled pressure on heavily indebted euro zone countries at the start of the week as investors worried not just about Greece but also about heightened risks in Spain -- where the government was drubbed in regional elections -- and ratings agencies' warnings for Italy and Belgium. "The Greek government has made remarkable progress in cutting (its budget) deficit by 5 percent of GDP in one year's time, yet further ambitious and determined action by the Greek government remains key for the program to succeed," he said.
