 PARIS  (Reuters) - European Central Bank policymaker Christian Noyer said on Tuesday that a Greek debt restructuring would be a "horror scenario" that would be tantamount to a default. 

 "A restructuring is a horror scenario," the ECB governing council member told reporters. "Greece must apply its (EU-IMF) program entirely and completely ... there is no alternative." (Reporting by  Daniel Flynn ; Editing by John Stonestreet)
