 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japanese Economics Minister Kaoru Yosano said on Tuesday that the government is likely to release new economic growth forecasts in late June or July, after the March earthquake and tsunami in northeast Japan damaged the economic outlook. 

 Yosano said earlier in the day that he expected Japan's economic growth to slow to about 0.6 to 0.7 percent in the fiscal year that started on April 1, compared with the government's most recent official projection of 1.5 percent, issued in December, and the previous fiscal year's 2.3 percent rise.
