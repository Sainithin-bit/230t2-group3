 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ) denied media reports on Tuesday that its vehicle production in Japan would recover to 90 percent of pre-quake levels in June, higher than the 70 percent it had flagged on May 11. 

 "The situation has not changed since we announced the latest plans along with our financial results on May 11," Toyota spokeswoman Monika Saito said. Public broadcaster NHK and Kyodo news agency reported that Toyota's domestic production would return to 90 percent of original plans next month. Toyota is currently producing at around 50 percent of pre-quake plans in Japan and an average 40 percent overseas. (Reporting by  James Topham  and  Chang-Ran Kim ; Editing by  Chris Gallagher )
