 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou will address the nation on television at 1700 GMT (1 p.m. EDT) on Thursday on his return from an EU summit which clinched a deal to lower Greece's debt burden. 
 A statement from Papandreou's office said the prime minister would first hold a meeting with President Karolos Papoulias to inform him, followed by a cabinet meeting before his address. "After the cabinet meeting, the prime minister will contact political leaders. At 8 p.m. (1700 GMT) the prime minister will address the nation," the statement said.
