 MUNICH/FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Siemens ( SIEGn.DE ), a bellwether of the euro zone's largest economy, plans to raise its full year dividend to a whopping 2.70 euros ($3.71) per share, well above consensus, as it emerged nearly unscathed from recession. 

 That is the first increase in the annual dividend of Europe's biggest engineering conglomerate from 1.60 euro since 2007. The proposed dividend is above the highest forecast of 2.40 euros in a Reuters poll and exceeds the poll average by nearly half. The company, whose products range from high-speed trains and wind turbines to hearing aids and lightbulbs, said operating profit at its three core businesses fell to 1.1 billion euros in the fiscal fourth quarter, down 45 percent from the year-earlier but better than the average analyst estimate of a 58.9 percent decline in the Reuters poll. Siemens expects profit from continuing operations in the current fiscal year to September 2011 to grow by 25-35 percent, with new orders improving significantly and organic sales returning to moderate growth. Investor attention shifted to the dividend and the company's new medium-term targets following Siemens' trading update for the July-September period, released on September 27. Quarterly growth was driven by its bread-and-butter industry sector, whose industry automation, drives technology and other short-cycle units profited from factories cranking up production in Asia and Germany. Siemens is the last company to report in this sector, following consensus-busting quarterly results of Swiss rival ABB ( ABBN.VX ), which said it expected the positive trend in short-cycle business to continue in 2011. Siemens trades at 12.8 times its estimated 12-month forward earnings, a discount to ABB's multiple of 15.5, GE's 13.3 and Rockwell's 17.3, according to Thomson Reuters' Starmine, which weights analysts' forecast according to their track record.
