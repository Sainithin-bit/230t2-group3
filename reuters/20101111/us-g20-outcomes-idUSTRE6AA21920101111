 SEOUL  (Reuters) - Negotiators have yet to complete the communique that G20 leaders will endorse on Friday, but on the key issue of global imbalances the language is likely to echo a statement issued by the group's finance ministers on October 23. 

 Washington has given up, for now, getting others to agree to numerical targets for current account deficits and surpluses. Instead, G20 leaders will agree to ask their finance ministers to draw up "indicative guidelines" to reduce excessive imbalances, according to a draft communique. "You can say in terms of the language it is the lowest common denominator," an Indian official said. Here are the answers to some questions such an outcome would raise: WHO WOULD WIN AND WHO WOULD LOSE? Germany and China, the two major surplus countries, would feel vindicated. They have resolutely opposed the U.S. gambit. "Fixing limits for current account surpluses or deficits is neither economically justified nor politically appropriate. This would also be in contrast to the principles of free trade in the world," German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Thursday. But Washington could point to progress on three levels. First, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner will feel that the G20, by signing up for guidelines, has endorsed the principle that trade imbalances should be capped even if numerical targets are a step too far for the group -- for now at least. Second, by getting the G20 to take up currencies and economic fundamentals, Washington now has a multilateral forum through which it can round up allies to exert peer pressure on China. Third, by focusing on sustainable current account levels, Geithner keeps up the pressure for adjustment while avoiding some of the rancor generated whenever outsiders zero in on the need for a stronger yuan, a neuralgic issue for Beijing. "It is my expectation that the communique will begin to put in place mechanisms that help us track and encourage ... balanced and sustainable growth," U.S. President Barack Obama said. WHAT WOULD HAPPEN NEXT? The divisions over global imbalances feed into a wider debate of how to create a more stable global monetary system. This is likely to be the priority issue for France, which assumes the rotating G20 presidency after the Seoul summit. "It's process. It will not start today and it won't finish today," Angel Gurria, secretary-general of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, said on Thursday. The International Monetary Fund might wind up with a bigger role as G20 referee, evaluating whether medium-term domestic plans are mutually productive. G20 countries have already submitted their projections, part of a Mutual Assessment Process agreed at last year's Pittsburgh G20 summit. Leaders in Seoul might authorize the IMF to release its findings. Publishing the document might quiet critics who contend the IMF has only carrots, no sticks, to coerce countries to act in the global interest. Although the IMF has no authority to impose domestic policies on countries that do not borrow from it, public naming and shaming would carry some weight. The IMF's members agreed last month to give the Fund more oversight authority so it can better spot potential sources of economic turmoil before a full-blown crisis erupts. That could include examining the international consequences of domestic policies, such as the U.S. Federal Reserve's much-maligned $600 billion bond-buying program. This does not mean the IMF could tell the Fed to cease and desist, but it would be in a stronger position to point out the spillover effects. WHAT ABOUT THE REST OF THE G20 AGENDA? Leaders can confidently be expected to highlight a package of reforms thrashed out by their finance ministers to give fast-growing emerging economies more power at the IMF. They will also endorse rules drawn up by regulators requiring banks to hold more, higher-quality capital so they do not have to be bailed out by taxpayers in the event of another financial crisis. The new rule book will not be ready in its entirety until well into 2011, and banks in some countries are furiously resisting the idea that global lenders deemed too big to fail should be required to hold bigger capital buffers. Critics say the G20 is losing its nerve by considering exempting some systemically important banks from the extra capital requirements. But expect leaders to stress the progress they are making toward preventing the recurrence of another meltdown. The summit will also sign off on a new strategy for promoting sustainable development in poor countries, a plan that OECD chief Gurria called a great leap forward. (Editing by  John Chalmers )
