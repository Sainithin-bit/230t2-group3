 SEOUL  (Reuters) - Prime Minister Stephen Harper on Thursday said he was not sure the G20 summit in Seoul could successfully address the question of global imbalances. 

 "The persistence of these imbalances is a problem in the long term and these things have to be addressed ... will they be addressed at this conference? I'm not so sure, but I think we're getting a more frank discussion on some of these matters, that they do have to be resolved," he told reporters. Harper said he also felt the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to print more money was the only option available, in the short-term at least, given the very slow growth rate of the U.S. economy. "Those who are criticizing the policy of the Federal Reserve -- I'm not sure what alternative they are suggesting," he said. (Reporting by  David Ljunggren ; Editing by  Tomasz Janowski )
