 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve would curtail its $600 billion asset purchase program if it sees the output gap shrinking more quickly than expected, an influential think tank said in a report on Thursday. 

 "The committee agreed that if conditions improved and risks diminished sufficiently so would the purchase ceiling," a report by Medley Global Advisors said. It said the policy-setting committee has still to decide on how to gauge the speed at which the output gap is improving enough to pull back on its plan. The factors it may consider, according to Medley, include "consolidating jobs growth, rising inflation and inflation expectations, consumer spending gains, and uncertainty dissipating enough to encourage hiring and investing."
