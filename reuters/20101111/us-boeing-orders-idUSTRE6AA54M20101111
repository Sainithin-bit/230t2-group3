 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Boeing Co ( BA.N ) said on Thursday it lost eight orders for 787 Dreamliners in the week that ended November 9 but gained eight after the transfer of orders from one customer to another, leaving the order book for 787s basically unchanged. 

 Boeing had said on Sunday Kuwait-based leasing company ALAFCO had shifted orders for the eight Dreamliners to Saudi Arabian Airlines. Boeing, which competes for commercial plane orders with Airbus ( EAD.PA ), has about 850 Dreamliner orders from more than 50 customers on its books. Boeing's light-weight, carbon-composite Dreamliner is more than three years behind its original schedule due to problems with the supply chain and labor. The company halted test flights for the plane after an electrical fire aboard one of its test planes forced an emergency landing on Tuesday. The company is investigating the incident and has said it is too early to tell if it would affect plans to make its first-delivery of a 787 by the middle of the first quarter of 2011. Boeing said it also took three orders for 737 narrow-bodies from an unidentified customer or customers. The company is seeing a rebound in orders and has taken orders for a net total of 483 commercial airplanes so far this year, compared with 263 in all of 2009. Boeing shares were down 2.8 percent at $65.16 in late trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday. (Reporting by Kyle Peterson; Editing by Dave Zimmerman, Steve Orlofsky and  Matthew Lewis )
