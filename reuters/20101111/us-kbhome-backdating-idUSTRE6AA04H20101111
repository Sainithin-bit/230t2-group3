 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Former head of KB Home Bruce Karatz was sentenced to eight months home detention on Wednesday, much lower than what the government had requested in one of its highest profile prosecutions of illegal stock option backdating. 

 Karatz was one of the highest-paid executives in the U.S. before stepping down as CEO of KB Home in 2006 amid the backdating scandal. Prosecutors had asked for a term of at least six years in prison. In court filings, federal prosecutors criticized the U.S. Probation Office for recommending that Karatz receive home confinement. A sentence without prison time would represent a "two-tiered system of justice" favoring the wealthy over "ordinary citizens," they wrote. But U.S. District Judge Otis Wright II castigated the government at the hearing, calling its language "mean spirited" and "inflammatory" and saying he treats everyone equally. After turning to Karatz later, the judge said: "I don't care, sir, whether you have a pot to piss in, what you get here is fairness." A jury in April convicted Karatz, 65, of two counts of mail fraud and two counts of making false financial statements. He was acquitted of 16 counts, including three of securities fraud, which were the most serious charges against him. Companies backdate by retroactively pricing option grants on days when a company's stock price is low, increasing the value of the options and locking in financial gains for employees. It is legal when recorded as a non-cash compensation expense, but the U.S. Department of Justice charged some executives for failing to disclose the practice. Nevertheless, the government has encountered some difficulty in winning convictions over backdating. Its case against Broadcom Corp officials fell apart last year due to prosecutorial misconduct. VIP SUPPORTERS Several of Karatz's supporters sat in the front row of a packed courtroom, among them former Los Angeles mayor Richard Riordan, billionaire philanthropist Eli Broad and Father Gregory Boyle, who runs a nonprofit called Homeboy Industries which gives work to reformed gang members. Karatz has been a daily volunteer at Homebody Industries in recent months, and has given money to the organization. "This has been the most difficult time in my life," Karatz told the judge. "Fortunately, I found a place where I can make a difference, and that place is Homeboy Industries." Prosecutors argued in a filing that Karatz should not be sentenced to home confinement in what they described as a 24-room mansion situated on a one acre estate. Wright also sentenced Karatz to 5 years probation, a $1 million fine and 2,000 hours community service. Assistant U.S. Attorney Paul Stern sat resting his head on his hand as the judge criticized his side, and later rose to say "there was no disrespect intended" in the filing. During the hearing, Wright noted that Karatz ended up earning about $40 million a year and gave up over $175 million in vested benefits when he was forced out of the company. Karatz also has disgorged over $6 million he is alleged to have gained through the pricing of stock options. There was some levity during the proceeding, when Wright chuckled as he read Karatz a standard advisory that he could request a transcript of the proceedings at "government expense" if he could not afford to pay for one. "Scratch that," the judge said, as some in the court laughed. The case in U.S. District Court, Central District of California is U.S. v. Karatz, 09-cr-0203.
