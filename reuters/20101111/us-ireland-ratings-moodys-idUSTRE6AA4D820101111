 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Moody's Investors Service said on Thursday it is awaiting the release of Ireland's four-year fiscal plan later this month to decide whether to downgrade the country's credit rating. 

 "We intend to conclude this review in the course of December," a Moody's spokesman told Reuters. The ratings agency put Ireland's Aa2 ratings on review for a possible downgrade on October 5, citing the impact of additional bank recapitalization needs, increased uncertainty regarding the economic outlook, and elevated borrowing costs. Ireland's borrowing costs soared to all-time highs on Thursday, further straining the debt-burdened government, as investors worried about the country's ability to service its obligations. A possible rating downgrade could send Ireland's debt spreads even higher. Among the big-three rating agencies, Moody's currently gives Ireland the highest credit rating, eight notches above junk status. Standard & Poor's has the country seven degrees above junk, at AA-minus, while Fitch has it one step below S&P, at A-plus. Moody's is particularly concerned about Ireland's ability to preserve the government's financial strength in a difficult economic environment. The four-year financial plan will be key for the government to preserve public finances and bring the deficit below 3 percent of gross domestic product by 2014, according to the agency.
