 SEOUL  (Reuters) - South Korean President Lee Myung-back said on Thursday U.S. economic recovery is important for a sustained global economic recovery and does not expect the recent U.S. quantitative easing to prompt rapid fund inflows to South Korea. 

 "I don't believe there is a rapid inflow of foreign funds into Korea because of this," Lee told a joint news conference with U.S. President Barack Obama. (Reporting by Cheon Jong-woo and Kim Yeon-hee; Editing by  Ken Wills )
