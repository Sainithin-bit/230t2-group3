 SEOUL  (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed her concerns to President Barack Obama about the recent moves by the Federal Reserve to inject liquidity into the U.S. economy, German G20 sources said on Thursday. 

 The sources also said that Obama told Merkel at a meeting on the sidelines of a G20 summit that he wants to see more domestic demand in Germany. They said Obama and Merkel agreed imbalances must be discussed on the basis of numerous indicators. The sources said that several points on China still have to be cleared up for the final communique.
