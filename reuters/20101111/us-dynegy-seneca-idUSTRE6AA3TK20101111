 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Hedge fund Seneca Capital, one of Dynegy Inc's ( DYN.N ) largest shareholders and an opponent of the struggling power company's takeover by the Blackstone Group ( BX.N ), said on Thursday it planned to nominate two executives to serve as directors on Dynegy's board. 

 Seneca, which owns around 9.3 percent of Dynegy's common stock, said Hunter Harrison, a former chief executive of Canadian National Railway ( CNR.TO ), and Jeff Hunter, co-founder of U.S. Power Generating Co, have agreed to be nominees. Seneca said it will begin the nomination process -- which it expects will take a minimum of 20 days -- on November 15, just two days before Dynegy shareholders are set to vote on the Blackstone deal. The hedge fund said it "believes that its plan for a refocused Dynegy with a re-energized board ... should provide an extremely attractive proposition to the substantial number of investors that Seneca believes are awaiting the defeat of the proposed merger to build or add to their investment positions in Dynegy stock." Blackstone agreed to buy Dynegy in August for about $543 million, or $4.7 billion including debt. The $4.50-a-share bid is structured unusually. It includes a $1.36 billion deal by Blackstone to sell four of Dynegy's natural gas-fired power plants to NRG Energy Inc ( NRG.N ). Seneca Capital and billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who also owns nearly 10 percent of Dynegy's shares, have argued that Blackstone is paying too little, threatening to upset the deal. Dynegy spokesman David Byford called the proposal "a desperate attempt to derail the Blackstone transaction based on hopes and assumptions about future energy prices, the timing of the implementation of Clean Air regulations, and other factors that neither Dynegy nor Seneca control." The power company has argued that should shareholders vote down its deal with Blackstone, the company would face severe financial hardships. It says market conditions have deteriorated since Blackstone's offer due to low and declining commodity prices, continued economic weakness and a challenging financial position. But Seneca has argued that the bid does not reflect the long-term value of the business, claiming that it values Dynegy's assets at less than one-third of their replacement cost. It said on Thursday that its board nominees would have their interests aligned with shareholders. Harrison recently bought 500,000 Dynegy shares and Hunter has committed to own 300,000 shares if he is elected to the board, Seneca said. Dynegy shares were unchanged at $4.50 in late morning trading on Thursday. (Reporting by  Michael Erman , editing by Maureen Bavdek)
