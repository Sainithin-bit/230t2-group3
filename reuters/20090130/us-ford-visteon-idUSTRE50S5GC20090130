 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) is not contemplating any large-scale support for struggling auto parts maker Visteon Corp ( VC.N ) and sees no need to inject cash into its former affiliate, the automaker said on Thursday. 

 Visteon, like other suppliers, has come under intense pressure from steep production cuts by major automakers and tight credit conditions. "We are not contemplating dramatic action," Ford Chief Financial Officer Lewis Booth said, when asked if the automaker anticipated any large-scale rescue of Visteon. "Visteon is a stand-alone company, and like all our suppliers, we talk to our suppliers when they have problems and try and work with them. But they are a stand-alone company," Booth told analysts and reporters on a conference call. Ford spun off its component operations as Visteon in 2000 but stepped in to save the company in 2005 by taking over some of its troubled assets and unionized workers. Visteon still derives a third of its sales from Ford. The failure of a major supplier could prompt a costly production disruption for automakers and suppliers due to the interlocking chain of U.S.-based suppliers, according to analysts. Ford Chief Executive Alan Mulally said Visteon has reduced its reliance on Ford over the past few years. "Visteon and Ford are clearly in a different place. Since we completed those transactions and we took care of parts of the plants, they have really diversified their portfolio," Mulally said. The auto parts sector is under intense pressure, especially after steep production cuts from all three U.S. automakers in the fourth quarter. More production shutdowns are planned in the current quarter. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week that Visteon had hired legal and financial advisers to prepare for possible bankruptcy proceedings. Visteon said it has been advised by Kirkland & Ellis and Rothschild since 2003. Visteon, which has been in a three-year restructuring launched shortly after the 2005 bailout by Ford, said earlier this month that its sales fell more than 40 percent in 2008. Visteon had $1.18 billion of cash at the end of 2008 and $2.76 billion in debt. General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) is still reeling from financial troubles at former parts unit Delphi Corp, which filed for bankruptcy in 2005. Delphi has been a major financial drag on GM at a time when the automaker is struggling to survive a deep downturn in sales. To date, GM has taken more than $11 billion in charges for Delphi's reorganization. (Reporting by Soyoung Kim; editing by John Wallace)
