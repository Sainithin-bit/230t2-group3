 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Business activity in the Midwest contracted in January and at a more severe rate than expected, a report showed on Friday. 

 Consumer confidence rose to a four-month high in January but improved less than economists had expected and remained weak overall, a survey showed on Friday. KEY POINTS: CHICAGO PMI: * The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago business barometer fell to 33.3 from 35.1 in December, a new low for the current downturn. * Economists had forecast the index at 34.0. A reading below 50 indicates contraction. * The employment component of the index fell to 34.8 from 39.2 in December. * Prices paid rose to 39.8 from 32.7 and new orders slipped to 30.7 from 31.5. UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN SURVEY: * The Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers said its final index reading of confidence for January rose to 61.2 from December's 60.1. * The final January reading is down slightly from the preliminary result earlier in the month of 61.9 and overall it remains in depressed territory, reflecting the deepening year-old recession in the world's largest economy. * Economists had expected a reading of 61.9, according to the median of forecasts in a Reuters poll. Their 63 forecasts ranged from 59.0 to 65.0. COMMENTS: MARK ZANDI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S ECONOMY.COM, WEST CHESTER, PENNSYLVANIA: CHICAGO PMI: "It's consistent with the view that the downturn is intensifying in the current quarter. Manufacturers took on too much inventory in Q4 and they are cutting production in Q1." REUTERS/UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN CONSUMER INDEX: "The consumers are panicked and confidence is shattered. Consumers may be less worried in January than December, perhaps because of lower gasoline prices and a more stable stock market. "Consumers will be very depressed through the spring...Q1 consumer spending will be down as much in Q1 as Q4. I'm looking for a slight improvement in Q2." PIERRE ELLIS, SENIOR ECONOMIST, DECISION ECONOMICS, NEW YORK: "Consumer sentiment by the end of January was revised marginally lower than it seemed earlier in the month. It's certainly not a meaningful change. "The Chicago purchasing managers' survey presented the same picture of manufacturing decline that has been in place for months. Nothing is budging there. There's no suggestion of a national improvement." BRIAN DOLAN, CHIEF CURRENCY STRATEGIST, FOREX.COM, BEDMINSTER, NEW JERSEY: "The Chicago PMI report was weak in the detail. This points to a very weak handoff for Q1 and dovetails with the poor momentum indicated by the earlier released Q4 GDP report. It looks negative overall for risk trades which should equate to lower euro and yen crosses near-term." VASSILI SEREBRIAKOV, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO, NEW YORK: "Chicago PMI is a bit weaker than expected but I don't think it will have lasting major impact on the market. The reaction to GDP earlier was more important for today." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. equity indexes hold gains after data. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices slightly pare gains. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar trims gains versus euro. ALSO RELEASED JAN 30: U.S. GDP shrinks 3.8 percent in Q4
