 (Reuters) - Roche Holding AG, the world's largest maker of cancer drugs, launched a hostile bid for Genentech on Friday for the 44 percent of the U.S. biotechnology company it does not already own. 

 Following are some key developments in Roche's relationship with the U.S. biotechnology company. APRIL, 1976 Genentech -- considered the founder of the biotechnology drugs industry, based on developing genetically modified copies of naturally occurring human proteins -- founded by venture capitalist Robert Swanson and biochemist Herbert Boyer. FEBRUARY, 1990 Genentech agrees to sell a controlling stake to Roche for $2.1 billion. Under the terms of the deal, Roche would own about 60 percent of Genentech's voting stock. JUNE, 1999 Roche exercises a call option to buy the remaining portion of Genentech it does not own, then reissues up to 19 percent of the stock, preserving the biotech's status as an independently traded company. Roche later makes a further offerings of Genentech shares. JULY, 2008 Roche offers to acquire all outstanding shares in its U.S. partner Genentech for $43.7 billion in cash to reinforce its position in cancer medicines. AUGUST, 2008 Genentech rejects Roche's offer to acquire the 44 percent of Genentech it does not already own, but says it would be willing to consider a sweetened bid. SEPTEMBER, 2008 Genentech shares slide below the offer price from Roche as spreading market turmoil stokes uncertainty about the takeover and the scope for an improved bid. JANUARY, 2009 Roche turns hostile, cutting its bid to a tender offer at $86.50 per share in cash, valuing the deal at $42.5 billion. The offer is at a premium of nearly 3 percent over Genentech's closing price the previous day. (Reporting by  Sam Cage  in Zurich; Editing by Hans Peters)
