 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The 3.8 percent drop in gross domestic product in the fourth quarter shows that the U.S. financial crisis has spread to the whole economy and immediate action is needed to support demand, the White House said Friday. 

 Real annual GDP fell at an annual rate of 3.8 percent in the fourth quarter, the largest one-quarter decline since 1982, Christina Romer, chair of the Council of Economic Advisers said in a statement. "This widespread decline emphasizes that the problems that began in our housing and financial sector have spread to nearly all areas of the economy," she said. "Immediate action to support both the financial sector and overall demand is essential."
