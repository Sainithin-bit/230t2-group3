 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's NEC Corp ( 6701.T )said on Friday it would cut its groupwide workforce by 20,000 people, and look for ways to exit its industrial liquid-crystal display-related business. 

 The job cut, to take place by March 2010, includes a previously announced staff reduction by NEC Electronics. As of the end of December, the group employed 150,000 people. (Reporting by Sachi Izumi)
