 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bonuses will decline 15 percent to 20 percent at the world's biggest banks this year due to pressure from the recession, mounting losses and new government stakes in the companies, according to leading compensation consultant Alan Johnson. 

 The injection of taxpayer funds would drive down compensations that are already under pressure at capital-strapped banks and other financial institutions, the head of New York-based Johnson and Associates said on Friday. "If you're one of these firms, you have to be acutely sensitive on this issue (bonuses) going forward," Johnson told Reuters. "It has nothing to do with the amount of money ... Any amount is too much," he said, adding that bonuses declined as much as 45 percent last year. The credit crisis triggered by the implosion of the U.S. mortgage market has punished U.S., European and Asian financial companies, spurring trillions of dollars in government bailouts. On Thursday, U.S. President Barack Obama criticized as "shameful" the $18.4 billion in bonuses paid to Wall Street executives last year. Public outcry has grown over reports of corporate excess by companies getting bailout funds, including Citigroup Inc, which intended to purchase a private jet, and former Merrill Lynch Chief Executive John Thain, who spent $1.2 million to refurbish his office last year. Merrill is now owned by Bank of America Corp. Citigroup said it canceled the plane order, and Thain said he will reimburse the company for the expenses. "You'd better scrutinize executive lunch rooms, you'd better scrutinize your offices, you'd better scrutinize those fresh flowers and car services and jets," said Johnson, whose firm advises financial companies on pay. "Unless it's totally defensible, they'll eat you up," he said. "If you think it's bad now, it's going to be worse in '09." (Editing by Lisa Von Ahn and Jeffrey Benkoe)
