 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - S&P stock futures extended declines on Friday after quarterly results showed sales at Honeywell ( HON.N ) and Procter and Gamble ( PG.N ) fell short of estimates. 

 * Investors also awaited data on U.S. fourth-quarter gross domestic product, due at 8.30 a.m. The median estimate from 81 economists in a Reuters poll is for a contraction of 5.4 percent on an annualized basis, which would be the worst reading since 1982. * S&P 500 futures fell 3.60 points and were below fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures were down 32 points, and Nasdaq 100 futures were flat. (Reporting by  Leah Schnurr ; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
