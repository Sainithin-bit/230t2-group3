 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Obama administration is still mulling its position on Buy American steel provisions approved this week by the House of Representatives and that have caused concern among trading partners, a White House spokesman said on Friday. 

 "The administration is reviewing those provisions as part of the recovery plan, and that review is continuing," White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters. (Reporting by  Doug Palmer ; editing by  Doina Chiacu )
