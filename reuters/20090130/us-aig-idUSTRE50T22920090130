 (Reuters) - American International Group Inc ( AIG.N ), the insurer selling units to repay a U.S. loan, may use a "whole spectrum of deals" and keep some businesses until initial public offerings are possible, its restructuring Chief Paula Reynolds told Bloomberg in an interview. 

 AIG awaits new guidelines from the Treasury and Federal Reserve to help potential buyers hobbled by asset losses, Reynolds said in the interview dated January 28. Buyers may be allowed to give stock rather than cash to New York-based AIG or pay less up front in exchange for future payments, Reynolds said in the interview. "We could take some things off for another day, we could substitute some other properties to accomplish the endgame. You can consider preparing some businesses for an IPO," Reynolds said. AIG was bailed out by taxpayers last year after bad mortgage bets left the insurer in a severe cash crunch and on the verge of bankruptcy. The company, which since September has received $152 billion in U.S. government bailout financing to avoid collapse, is scrambling to raise cash through the sale of some of its units.
