 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. economy shrank at the fastest rate since early in Ronald Reagan's presidency, Japan's business outlook worsened, and European inflation tumbled, adding pressure on policymakers to quickly stimulate growth. 

 Britain and Germany called for a strong global economic watchdog to prevent rather than react to financial crises like the one that has spread recession around the world. U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and others met to mull financial and regulatory reforms. U.S. gross domestic product fell at an annualized 3.8 percent in the fourth quarter, as consumers spent less for a second straight three-month period. "The recession is deepening and the urgency of our economic crisis is growing," U.S. President Barack Obama said. "This is a continuing disaster for America's families. The decline in GDP was the largest since the first quarter of 1982, though it was less steep than the 5.4 percent that economists expected. But a buildup of unsold inventories cushioned the drop, and this may make results in the current quarter look worse. "Firms were not cutting production as fast as their sales were falling," said Nigel Gault, chief U.S. economist of Global Insight in Lexington, Massachusetts. "That's a bad sign." U.S. and Japanese stocks fell. U.S. bank stocks were particularly hard hit on speculation that policymakers might fail to agree on how to set up a "bad bank" to absorb toxic assets. STIMULUS SOUGHT The U.S. Senate is preparing to consider an economic stimulus plan next week, after the House of Representatives backed an $819 billion package on Wednesday. Obama pledged to reverse Bush administration labor policies that unions said favored employers over workers, saying a strong middle class needs strong labor. And a day after Obama called large Wall Street bonuses "shameful," Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri proposed a law to block executives at banks relying on government aid from making more than Obama's salary of $400,000 annually. In calling for a global economic overseer, German Chancellor Angela Merkel told the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland: "This may even lead to a U.N. Economic Council, just as the Security Council was created after the Second World War." GLOOM IN JAPAN In Japan, rising unemployment, slowing household spending and a dim industrial outlook fanned fears of deflation and a contracting economy. Electronics giant Hitachi Ltd said it may suffer Japan's largest one-year loss by a manufacturer, while chipmaker NEC Corp announced 20,000 job cuts. Industrial production fell a record 9.6 percent in December, and core inflation was nearly zero. Japan's quarterly GDP data, due in February, is expected to show that its economy fell at a double-digit clip. "We must watch if a worsening of the economy pushes Japan into a deflationary spiral," said Tatsushi Shikano, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities. Euro zone inflation fell in December to near a 10-year low, as unemployment rose to 8 percent. Analysts said that adds pressure on the European Central Bank to cut its target interest rate below 2 percent, a record low. And figures from the Reserve Bank of Australia showed total credit unexpectedly fell in December, fueling expectations of a central bank rate cut next week. STOCK INDEXES FALL The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 1.8 percent and the Standard & Poor's 500 fell 2.3 percent. The Dow and S&P both fell nearly 9 percent in January. Exxon Mobil Corp, the world's largest publicly traded company, and Chevron Corp posted results that were better than expected. Exxon's fourth-quarter earnings fell by a third on lower oil prices but its full-year profit of $45.2 billion set a U.S. record. Oil futures rose on Friday after OPEC signaled it may reduce production. Procter & Gamble Co, the world's largest consumer products company, cut its full-year outlook after sales slowed, the latest signal that consumers and retailers are cutting spending. Construction and mining equipment maker Caterpillar Inc announced 2,110 job cuts on top of 20,000 set on Monday. U.S. companies have announced more than 200,000 job cuts this month. The FTSEurofirst 300 index closed nearly unchanged, while Japan's Nikkei share average closed down 3.1 percent. In Europe, the banking industry's sea of red ink grew as Belgian-French financial services group Dexia SA forecast a 2008 net loss of 3 billion euros ($3.9 billion), cutting its dividend and eliminating 900 jobs.
