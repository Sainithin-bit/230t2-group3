 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Wall St bank Lehman Brothers LEH.N said on Friday it tapped a veteran of larger rival Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) as managing director and co-head of its financial institutions group for Asia-Pacific excluding Japan. 

 Julian Cheong will join David Kim as co-head of the financial institutions group as part of Lehman's expansion in the region, the bank said. Cheong spent nine years at Goldman, most recently as managing director, responsible for Southeast Asia coverage and principal investments. Lehman has been among the biggest victims of the global credit crisis, taking a roughly $7 billion hit. Media reports this week said the bank failed in its efforts to sell a large stake to Asian investors. (Reporting by  Tony Munroe ; Editing by Keiron Henderson)
