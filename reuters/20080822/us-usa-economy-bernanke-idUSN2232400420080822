 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Friday called the U.S. inflation outlook "highly uncertain," and said central bank policy-makers would do what they must to preserve price stability. 

  KEY POINTS:  * Bernanke, speaking to a Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, said declines in commodity prices and stability in the dollar are encouraging.  * Bernanke also said the year-old financial storm "has not yet subsided."  COMMENTS: SUBODH KUMAR, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, SUBODH KUMAR &  ASSOCIATES, TORONTO: "The inflation numbers have been moving up in recent releases. But Bernanke seems to be saying that the Fed is essentially going to remain on hold. I think the market is maybe removing some of the expectations that have been voiced about the Fed being poised for rate hikes. My view has always been that the major central banks will not have any rate increases at least until the middle of next year. What Bernanke has said, what we've heard from Trichet, confirms this. The markets seem to be bouncing like a pinball between what happens in commodity prices to what happens in credit to what happens with interest rates. That's probably not going to stop any time soon."  MARKET REACTION:  STOCKS: U.S. equity indexes add to gains  BONDS: U.S. Treasury prices slightly pare losses  DOLLAR: U.S. dollar holds steady at higher levels RATE FUTURES: Fed fund futures are little moved, suggesting little chance of an FOMC rate hike this year
