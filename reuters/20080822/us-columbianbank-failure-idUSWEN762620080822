 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Bank regulators closed Columbian Bank and Trust Company on Friday, the ninth U.S. bank to fail this year as the struggling economy and falling home prices take their toll on financial institutions. 

 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp said Columbian Bank and Trust of Topeka, Kansas, had $752 million in assets and $622 in deposits. Citizens Bank and Trust has agreed to assume the failed bank's insured deposits. Columbian Bank and Trust's nine branches will reopen on Monday as branches of Citizens Bank.
