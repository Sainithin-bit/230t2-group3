 LONDON  (Reuters) - The Bank of England detailed a ground-breaking plan on Monday to lend banks up to 50 billion pounds ($99.76 billion) to help them operate during the credit squeeze. 

 It said it would allow banks to swap mortgage-backed bonds which have become hard to trade for specially-issued Treasury bills. The asset swaps will be for one year and may be renewed for a total of three years and are available for assets existing at the end of 2007, not new lending, the BoE said. This would free up banks' balance sheets, allowing them to lend more to households facing a dwindling choice of mortgage options and declining property values.
