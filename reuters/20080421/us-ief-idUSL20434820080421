 ROME  (Reuters) - Record oil has added to the strain on a fragile world economy, but producers stopped short of saying prices were too high at talks with their customers on Monday. 

 Energy producers and consumers attending the International Energy Forum (IEF) in Rome are in broad agreement there is enough oil on the market in the immediate term and OPEC ministers have said they will not boost output right now. They also agreed the weak dollar had helped to drive oil prices, which hit a record well above $117 a barrel on Monday. But while the consumers are certain this is too high, some producer countries have said the strength is only nominal, given the weakness of the dollar. "When I spoke from the podium I asked the ministers, 'Do you agree with me that current prices are too high' -- totally quiet," said Nobuo Tanaka, executive director of the International Energy Agency, which represents consumer nations. "When I asked the question, 'Are there any ministers who don't agree' -- total silence." At first, rising oil prices had a limited impact on the world's economy, but they have begun to bite. "Oil prices are at an extraordinary high level today," said Akira Amari, Japan's economy trade and industry minister, in a speech. "I have been repeatedly stating my strong sense of crisis that the global economy would suffer a setback if these conditions are left as they are." The International Monetary Fund's No. 2 official also said oil prices, which he expected to stay strong, were adding to the pain. "It's dampening growth -- that's for sure, but of course it is benefiting exporters," John Lipsky told Reuters. LACK OF SUPPLY RESPONSE In a speech, he added high prices emphasized "the urgency of policy actions in the area of oil investment". So far, high oil prices have not translated into extra supplies and oil producers have complained a rally across commodities and a shortage of qualified staff have increased the difficulty of new exploration and production projects. "Some projects -- we see it worldwide -- are delayed because they are not economical, even with this price we see today," said Qatari Oil Minister Abdullah al-Attiyah. "No, I'm not enjoying the high price. I'm enjoying the challenge of the business." In a sustained bull-run, U.S. crude has risen from less than $20 a barrel at the start of 2002 to its record of $117.76 hit on Monday. Prices have been driven by strong demand, especially from Asia, and a chronic lack of investment in oil infrastructure. Since a financial crisis began around August last year, triggered by U.S. bad debt and a collapsing housing market, the weakness of the U.S. dollar has added to the strength of some dollar-denominated commodities, which investors view as an inflation hedge. The impact of high prices has eroded consumer spending and energy demand in the United States, where gasoline prices have risen above $3 a gallon. But those suffering most are the poorest nations, said Fatih Birol, the IEA's chief economist. "Of course there is an impact on the economy ... The greatest impact is on poor, oil importing countries," he said, citing oil importers in Africa. The impact on the poorest was among the themes of the International Energy Forum, which continue until Tuesday. The forum, which meets every two years, brings together some 60 energy ministers, as well as top executives of the oil industry, but is often dismissed as a talking shop.
