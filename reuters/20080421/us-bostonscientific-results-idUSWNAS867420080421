 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Medical device maker Boston Scientific Corp said on Monday quarterly net earnings more than doubled as cost savings from a restructuring program offset weaker sales in its core drug-eluting stent market. 

 Stent revenue fell as Boston Scientific faced new competition from Medtronic Inc, which in February launched the first new drug-coated stent in the United States in four years. "Revenue was as expected but flat. Earnings were better than expected, which means that they saved more money than we thought they would," said Tim Nelson, analyst with mutual fund company First American Funds. Boston Scientific said first-quarter net income was $322 million, or 21 cents a share, compared with $120 million, or 8 cents a share, a year ago. Excluding special items, Boston Scientific earned $357 million, or 24 cents a share, compared with $262 million, or 17 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Analysts on average had forecast 19 cents a share in the latest quarter, according to Reuters Estimates. Boston Scientific said it completed the sale of five nonstrategic businesses during the quarter. It has been shedding assets and reducing its work force to cope with downturns in its two key heart device markets. "We continued to make good progress in the quarter, particularly in our efforts to bring expenses in line with revenues," Chief Executive Jim Tobin said in a statement. Net sales in the first quarter were $2.05 billion, including sales from divested businesses of $32 million, compared with $2.09 billion in the year-ago quarter, which included $135 million in sales from divested businesses. The Natick, Massachusetts-based company said worldwide sales of its drug-releasing heart stents declined to $428 million in the first quarter from $468 million a year ago. U.S. sales of drug-eluting stents were $218 million, down from $293 million. Stents are small wire mesh tubes inserted into coronary arteries to prop them open after they have been cleared of blockages. Nelson estimated two-thirds of Boston Scientific's 26 percent drop in U.S. stent sales could be attributed to Medtronic's product launch. The stent market, he said, remains soft after studies raised safety concerns and questioned their effectiveness compared with medicines alone. But Morningstar analyst Debbie Wang said the stent market appeared to be bottoming. "Boston Scientific is definitely losing share, but I think they've done a fairly admirable job of holding onto what they can," she said. Johnson & Johnson, the other U.S. stent maker, also saw its sales of the devices suffer in the latest quarter. The company said worldwide sales of its cardiac rhythm management devices rose to $565 million, including $411 million in sales of implantable cardioverter defibrillators, which manage abnormal heart rhythms. CRM sales in last year's quarter were $539 million, including ICD sales of $398 million. Boston Scientific acquired the CRM business when it bought Guidant Corp for $27 billion in 2006. Boston Scientific forecast overall second-quarter sales of between $1.95 billion and $2.08 billion and income, excluding special items, of between 14 cents and 19 cents a share. It estimated second-quarter net earnings would be between 4 cents and 9 cents a share. Boston Scientific's shares closed on Monday up 38 cents, or 3 percent, at $13.03 on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock is up 12 percent for the year to date, but off 70 percent from its mid-2004 peak. (Reporting by Susan Kelly; editing by Carol Bishopric/Andre Grenon)
