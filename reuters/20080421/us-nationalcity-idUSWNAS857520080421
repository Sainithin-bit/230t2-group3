 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - National City Corp NCC.N, a large U.S. Midwest bank, said on Monday it is raising $7 billion and slashed its dividend after mortgage and home equity problems led to its third straight quarterly loss. 

 The bank's shares plummeted after it agreed to sell a stake at a discount to private equity firm Corsair Capital and other investors, diluting existing shareholdings. In late trading, the shares were down $2.23, or 26.8 percent, at $6.10. National City joins banks such as Citigroup Inc ( C.N ), Wachovia Corp WB.N and Washington Mutual Inc ( WM.N ) that have raised capital and cut dividends after losses from mortgages and other debt forced them to shore up their balance sheets. The announcement by Cleveland-based National City ends several weeks of speculation it was seeking a buyer after struggling with exposure to the hard-hit Ohio and Michigan real estate markets, and a badly timed foray into Florida. "You combined very weak first-quarter operating trends, with a dilutive transaction and a suggestion that the company will not be sold," said Terry McEvoy, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. "The stock is reflecting that." Corsair, which is leading a group of investors, and one other private equity investor will invest $985 million, with the balance from other investors, including several current institutional stockholders. Among the other investors alongside Corsair is MSD Capital LP, an investment firm formed to manage the capital of Dell Inc DELL.O Chief Executive Michael Dell, a source familiar with the situation said. The Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan is also one of the investors, a spokeswoman said. Richard Thornburgh, a Corsair vice chairman, will join National City's board. National City said it will issue $6.37 billion of convertible preferred stock, and $631 million of common stock consisting of 126.2 million shares at $5 per share. The latter price is 40 percent below the bank's Friday closing price. Corsair and some other investors will also receive warrants with a term of five years. National City also cut its common stock dividend to 1 cent per share from 21 cents per share. The structure of the investments resembles the $7 billion infusion announced on April 8 by Washington Mutual. That included a $2 billion investment from private equity firm TPG Inc and was also accompanied by a dividend cut. FIRST QUARTER LOSS National City posted a $171 million first-quarter loss, or 27 cents per share, compared with a profit of $319 million, or 50 cents, a year earlier. Analysts, on average, expected the company to post a profit of 30 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. The bank set aside $1.39 billion for loan losses, twice what it set aside in the fourth quarter and more than 11 times the $122 million it set aside a year earlier. Much of the increase was attributable to expected home equity loan losses, as well as a pool of subprime mortgages it retained when it sold its First Franklin Financial Corp subprime lending unit to Merrill Lynch & Co Inc MER.N in 2006. "It is both necessary and prudent to build reserves in anticipation of a continued difficult environment for housing- related loan," National City Chief Executive Peter Raskind said in a statement. National City said net interest margin was 3.18 percent in the first quarter, compared with 3.30 percent in the fourth quarter and 3.69 percent in the year-ago quarter. Net charge-offs were $538 million in the first quarter, up from $147 million in the year-ago period. In January, the bank sold more than $2 billion of securities, including $1.4 billion of convertible notes. Earlier this month, it said it was exploring strategic alternatives. People briefed on the matter previously told Reuters the bank had been in talks with more than one potential buyer, including Fifth Third Bancorp ( FITB.O ). Other banks reported to have expressed interest include Bank of Nova Scotia ( BNS.TO ) and KeyCorp ( KEY.N ). Goldman Sachs & Co and the law firms Sullivan & Cromwell LLP and Jones Day advised National City. RBS Greenwich Capital and the law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP advised Corsair.
