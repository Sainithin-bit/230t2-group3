 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Chip maker Texas Instruments Inc said on Monday its quarterly profit rose, but forecast results below Wall Street expectations due to cautious customer buying trends across its markets and weaker demand for high-end cell phones. 

 TI shares fell 2.5 percent in extended trading after the company, whose chips are used in everything from cell phones to industrial products, said it was taking a conservative view for the second quarter amid economic concerns. "We're just responding to our customers' conservatism. They're managing their inventory very tight," Chief Financial Officer Kevin March said in an interview with Reuters. March also said demand for third-generation (3G) high-speed wireless phones would increase more slowly than expected. "Demand will probably increase over time, but at a more delayed pace than customers might have previously expected," March said, referring to the advanced phones, which include as many as four times more TI chips than more basic phones. March also said chip demand for computer hard disk drive was weaker than expected in the first quarter. TI's profit rose to $662 million, or 49 cents a share, from $516 million, or 35 cents a share, a year ago. Excluding a 6 cents per share tax benefit, the latest number met analyst forecasts of 43 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose to $3.27 billion from $3.19 billion. TI forecast second-quarter earnings per share of 42 cents to 48 cents on revenue of $3.24 billion to $3.5 billion. Analysts on average had expected second-quarter earnings per share of 48 cents on revenue of $3.45 billion. Stifel Nicolaus analyst Cody Acree said it was not surprising that TI saw weak 3G demand after a disappointing view from its biggest customer, Nokia, last week, but the broader caution for other products was a new concern. "That's the biggest concern right now," said Acree, who noted the company had only cited wireless demand as an issue when it lowered its first-quarter guidance in March. "It's disappointing that the visibility has not improved." In March, TI forecast earnings per share of 41 cents to 45 cents on revenue $3.21 billion to $3.35 billion, warning at the time that wireless demand was weaker than expected, particularly from one customer. Texas Instruments shares fell to $29.80 in late trading from its close of $30.59 on the New York Stock Exchange. Qualcomm Inc, TI's biggest rival in wireless chips, is set to report quarterly results on Wednesday, April 23. (Additional reporting by  Michele Gershberg ; Editing by  Andre Grenon )
