 LONDON  (Reuters) - Hopes that the worst of the credit crisis has past boosted investor sentiment on Monday with global stocks trading at their highest since mid-January. 

 Japanese shares stormed to a two-month closing high but European equities slipped after a strong rally in the previous session. The dollar, too, fell back from recent gains. Sentiment was boosted at the end of last week by U.S. earnings resilience from internet leader Google and heavy equipment maker Caterpillar and fewer-than expected writedowns from banking giant Citigroup. "Banks it seems are just figures in a cathartic Greek tragedy, on the road to redemption," Societe Generale said in a note. The Bank of England was also adding to investor confidence with a plan to swap UK government bonds worth around 50 billion pounds ($99.8 billion) for banks' riskier mortgage debt. World stocks as measured by MSCI were up 0.8 percent at levels not seen since January 15. It has risen 4.3 percent since its close last Monday. Its emerging market stock counterpart .MSCIEF was up 1 percent on the day. In Europe, however, the FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index was down 0.3 percent, retreating slightly after rising more than 2 percent on Friday. Earlier on Monday, Japan's Nikkei 225 benchmark .N224 rose 1.6 percent to a nearly two-month closing high of 13,696.55, a gain of 220.10 points. "The market has largely recovered from the 'Bear Stearns shock' and the dollar is recovering as well," said Hiroaki Osakabe, a fund manager at Chiba Asset Management, referring to the fire sale of the U.S. investment bank in March. The broader TOPIX  .TOPX  closed up 2.1 percent at 1,331.51. DOLLAR SLIPS The dollar was generally lower, down 0.3 percent against a basket of major currencies .DXY. The euro rose to $1.5874 <EUR=, up 0.3 percent and the dollar fell 0.3 percent against the Japanese yen. Euro zone government bonds steadied after a sharp decline last week. The two-year Schatz yield was flat at 3.810 percent while the 10-year Bund yield slipped 2.1 basis points to 4.118 percent. Improving sentiment for riskier assets is adding pressure to the safe-haven government debt market.
