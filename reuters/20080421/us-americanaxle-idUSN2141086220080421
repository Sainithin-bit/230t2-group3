 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) said on Monday it has cut production at two more plants due to the United Auto Workers strike at American Axle & Manufacturing Holdings Inc ( AXL.N ), a major supplier to the automaker. 

 GM remains under pressure, with production at about 30 plants at least partly idled due to the eight-week old UAW strike at American Axle, and strikes or threatened strikes by local units against some other GM plants. The strike at American Axle largely has affected GM's production of slower selling vehicles, such as large sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks. The actions by local units threaten production of faster selling cars and crossovers. On Monday, GM idled a shift at its Oshawa, Ontario, plant that builds Chevrolet Impala and Buick LaCrosse sedans and cut production of four-speed transmissions at its Willow Run plant in Michigan for the Buick Lucerne, Cadillac DTS and full-size pickups, GM spokesman Dan Flores said. The Oshawa car plant has three shifts regularly and nearly 4,000 hourly workers. The Willow Run plant has nearly 1,500 hourly workers. UAW and American Axle negotiators took a break from talks on Saturday afternoon and were expected to continue bargaining Monday to try to end the strike by 3,650 workers at five U.S. plants, company spokeswoman Renee Rogers said. GM and the UAW reached agreement on wages and benefits in a broad master contract last year, but most of the UAW's locals have yet to complete agreements on work rules and other details that must be hammered out at the individual facilities. Workers went on strike Thursday at GM's Lansing Delta Township assembly plant that builds hot-selling Buick Enclave, Saturn Outlook and GMC Acadia crossovers. Crossovers are SUVs built on car platforms that are easier to drive and have a more comfortable ride than larger SUVS based on truck platforms. Negotiations ran through the weekend and were continuing Monday between GM and the UAW for the Delta Township plant, near Lansing, Michigan, where production remains idled, Flores said. On Friday, a UAW local representing workers at a transmission plant in Warren, Michigan, agreed to extend talks beyond a union deadline indefinitely. However, GM also has received notice that workers at the Fairfax, Kansas, plant where GM builds the Chevrolet Malibu -- a strong-selling sedan seen as crucial to the automaker's lineup -- could strike as early as Tuesday. And a local representing workers at a metal fabricating plant in Grand Rapids, Michigan, sent GM a strike notice on Friday, leaving it free to strike April 25.
