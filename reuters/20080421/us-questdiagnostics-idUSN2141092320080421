 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Quest Diagnostics Inc ( DGX.N ), the largest U.S. medical testing company, posted a 32 percent increase in quarterly profit on Monday on a boost in revenue from an acquisition, sending shares higher by about 6 percent. 

 First-quarter net income rose to $139.6 million, or 71 cents per share, from $105.9 million, or 54 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding discontinued operations, earnings were 2 cents ahead of the average Wall Street forecast, according to Reuters Estimates. "Overall it lacked any bad surprises seen in previous quarters," said Alex Morozov, an analyst at Morningstar. In the fourth quarter, Quest reported a net loss after setting aside reserves to fund a settlement with the government over a probe of a manufacturing unit closed in 2006. It is also still dealing with loss of a big contract with UnitedHealth Group ( UNH.N ) to archrival Laboratory Corp of America ( LH.N ). Revenue increased 17 percent to $1.78 billion. The acquisition of Ameripath, which Quest bought in May 2007, lifted revenue by 13 percent. Quest's clinical testing volume rose 5.6 percent. The New Jersey-based company said it continues to expect 2008 earnings from continuing operations of between $3 and $3.20 per share on revenue growth of about 9 percent. Quest shares rose $2.85 to $48.47, while Laboratory Corp of America also rose, about 2 percent to $76.43, on the NYSE.
