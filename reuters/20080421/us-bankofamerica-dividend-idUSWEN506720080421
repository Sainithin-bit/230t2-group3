 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis said on Monday the second-largest U.S. bank has not changed its philosophy about its dividend, but will do what is prudent in light of market conditions. 

 The 64 cent per share dividend equated to a 6.64 percent dividend yield as of Friday, higher than at many rivals. Several large U.S. lenders have lowered their dividends this year, including Citigroup Inc ( C.N ), Wachovia Corp WB.N, Washington Mutual Inc ( WM.N ) and National City Corp NCC.N. "We have not changed our philosophy about the dividend," Lewis said on a conference call, after the bank posted a 77 percent drop in first-quarter profit. He said, however, that if the U.S. economy worsened dramatically, perhaps sinking into a long recession, "we would do what we think prudent to manage capital." Lewis also said Bank of America plans to return to its targeted 8 percent Tier-1 capital ratio through "earnings generation and no share repurchases," and the bank maintains an "abundance of liquidity." The Tier-1 ratio ended March at 7.51 percent, the bank said. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel, editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
