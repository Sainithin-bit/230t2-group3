 ZURICH  (Reuters) - Nestle SA ( NESN.VX ) sales grew 6 percent to 25.7 billion Swiss francs ($25.30 billion) in the first quarter, meeting market forecasts but disappointing some investors, and a weak dollar eroded strong gains in volume and pricing. 

 Underlying or "organic" growth, which strips out currency effects and acquisitions, rose 9.8 percent, beating expectations, signaling that that the world's largest food group was performing well despite wild swings in global markets for raw materials such as coffee, flour and cocoa. But shares in the company eased as investors who had hoped for even more took profits, with Nestle stock down 2.5 percent, leading the DJ Stoxx European food index .SX3P down 1.3 percent. Nestle shares have outperformed rivals since it raised its earnings outlook in March. "...we believe that many investors were already thinking around double-digits," Citi analysts said in a research note, referring to like-for-like sales growth. Nestle's strategic focus on health and nutrition and targeted acquisitions has made it the darling of the food sector and has pushed sales and profits higher even in tough markets. The maker of Nescafe coffee and KitKat chocolate bars, confirmed its earnings outlook -- which it raised in March -- for underlying sales to rise in 2008 at a similar rate to the 7.4 percent of last year and for operating margins to improve. Analysts had expected sales to rise to 25.5 billion francs as Nestle uses its brand-name pricing power to pass on higher costs to its wholesale buyers. "These are good quality results. It was pretty much at the high end of expectations," said Chevreux analyst Mario Montagnani in Zurich. "There was a strong contribution from volume increases -- it wasn't just pricing coming through," Montagnani said. "So there is no evidence of a slowdown or of people trading down (to cheaper products)." Nestle raised prices 5.3 percent during the period while "real internal growth", which primarily measures volume, rose 4.5 percent, Nestle said in Monday's statement. But the pace of gains in pricing and volumes are expected to decline later in 2008 as commodity prices relent from their steady rise, Nestle said. "The group expects raw material cost pressures to abate somewhat in the course of 2008 and its reported pricing to come down in the second half of the year," it said. The dollar, which probed all-time record lows versus the Swiss franc during the quarter, shaved 7 percent off sales figure. Nestle was one of the first major food firms to recognize the threat of rising raw material costs. Its hedging and price hikes gave it an edge over competitors such as Danone ( DANO.PA ) and Unilever ( ULVR.L ). "Despite the acceleration in pricing, group volumes held up as well as we expected," said Goldman Sachs in a note to clients. "The company continues to prove its pricing power." "Nestle has exceeded expectations, especially in organic growth. But Nestle has already said how well the business is going. And now Nestle has simply confirmed the forecasts, which that was already in the share price," he said. Nestle is poised to reap $39 billion in windfall gains from a deal to sell its contact lens division Alcon ACL.N in several stages. With the proceeds, analysts say Nestle will buy a big player in health and nutrition, as well as paying down debt and buying back shares. Analysts had expected organic growth of 8.9 percent and real internal growth of 4.6 percent. The Vevey, Switzerland-based company -- which also makes Perrier water, Buitoni pasta and Maggi soups -- trades at about 17 times forecast 2008 earnings, according to Reuters data. That is near Anglo-Dutch Unilever's multiple of 16.8, but behind France's Danone at 20.8. (Additional reporting by Ruppert Pretterklieber; Editing by  Louise Ireland )
