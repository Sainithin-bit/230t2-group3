 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Surging oil prices hit new highs on Monday as Bank of America's poor earnings and outlook pulled down banking stocks and dashed hopes that a global credit crisis was nearing an end. 

 The dollar fell broadly after weaker-than-expected profits at Bank of America ( BAC.N ), the largest U.S. retail bank, made investors realize there was still more pain to come for battered banks in the United States and Europe. Crude oil prices hit record highs over $117 a barrel as rebel attacks cut Nigerian supplies and a Scottish refinery strike threatened North Sea crude production. U.S. and euro zone government debt prices fell amid fading hopes that the European Central Bank will cut interest rates or that the Federal Reserve would continue aggressively cutting rates. The Dow industrials and the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500 Index closed slightly down, but the surge in oil prices lifted energy stocks and the energy services sector. A rise in Apple Inc, which reports results on Wednesday, led technology shares and helped the tech-heavy Nasdaq close up. European shares fell sharply on renewed concerns that the banking sector could face a prolonged period of dreary earnings from tight credit markets sparked by the U.S. housing slump. Analysts said banks may need to raise more capital, and Bank of America Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis said the effects of the battered housing market may take at least the rest of the year to work out. "People think the profitability prospects for banks are significantly damaged," said Stephen Massocca, co-chief executive at San Francisco-based investment bank Pacific Growth Equities. "I don't see nor do I anticipate that the bank capital raises are over." The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  fell 24.34 points, or 0.19 percent, to 12,825.02 and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  slipped 2.16 points, or 0.16 percent, to 1,388.17. But the Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  gained 5.07 points, or 0.21 percent, to 2,408.04. Investors had shrugged off weak earnings reports last week from Citigroup Inc ( C.N ), JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ) and Wachovia Corp WB.N amid optimism the credit crunch was past. But Wall Street's mood turned gloomier after Bank of America's results fell short as more consumers and businesses fell behind on debt payments. Quarterly profit fell a larger-than-expected 77 percent, dragged down by the bank's more than $5 billion of write-downs and credit-related costs. "The banking results are showing write-downs across the different asset classes," said Willem Sels, a credit strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort. "It's not just mortgages anymore, but they are showing write-downs in small business loans and also on consumer debt like auto loans." If tight lending standards persist, corporate defaults will rise relatively sharply, Sels said. "Markets seem to want to focus on the positives and believe that banks can start with a clean slate. But the loan and mortgage books' problems are still there," Sels said. A drop in shares of Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ), which was expected to announce a large rights issue, and Swiss food group Nestle ( NESN.VX ) after a disappointing earnings update pulled European shares lower. RBS confirmed in a brief statement that it was considering a rights issue, details of which could come on Tuesday. The bank is set to announce Europe's biggest-ever rights issue and more than $10 billion of losses on toxic investments this week, people familiar with the matter have said. The FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of top European shares fell 1.06 percent to 1,311.82 points. The index gained more than 3 percent last week after a flurry of positive earnings surprises on both sides of the Atlantic as the reporting season continued. But Morgan Stanley said the bear market rally, which has seen the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 gain around 10 percent from its low hit on March 17, is over. Asian shares rose, led by financial firms, to their highest in more than seven weeks in a rally that extended Friday's gains on hopes the credit crisis may be at a turning point. The MSCI measure of Asian stocks excluding Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS rose 2.6 percent after earlier hitting its highest level since February 29. Oil prices also gained support from officials with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries who said the market had enough oil and that the producer group would not ramp up output to help bring down prices. U.S. light crude settled up 79 cents at $117.48 a barrel, off the record high of $117.76 hit earlier. London Brent crude LCOc1 settled 51 cents higher at $114.43 a barrel after hitting an all-time peak of $114.86. Gold ended lower after rising earlier on the back of the record high oil prices as investors traded cautiously after Friday's sell-off. Gold is generally seen as a hedge against oil-led inflation. The metal also moves in the opposite direction of the dollar, as a weaker U.S. currency makes gold cheaper for holders of other currencies and often lifts bullion demand. Gold XAU= rose as high as $928.50 an ounce and was at $913.80/914.60 in afternoon trade. The dollar fell against a basket of major trading-partner currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index .DXY off 0.48 percent at 71.619. The euro  EUR=  rose 0.71 percent to $1.5926. Against the yen, the dollar  JPY=  fell 0.41 percent to 103.23. U.S. Treasury debt prices were mixed. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note US10YT=RR was down 4/32 in price, with the yield at 3.72 percent. The two-year U.S. Treasury note US2YT=RR was down 3/32, with the yield at 2.19 percent. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond US30YT=RR was up 8/32, with the yield at 4.48 percent.
