 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ), the second-largest U.S. bank, on Monday said first-quarter profit fell, hurt by write-downs and rising credit losses. 

 Net income for the Charlotte, North Carolina-based company fell to $1.21 billion, or 23 cents per share, from $5.26 billion, or $1.16, a year earlier. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel; editing by  Mark Porter )
