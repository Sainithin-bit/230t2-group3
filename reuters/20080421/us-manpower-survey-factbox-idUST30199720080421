 (Reuters) - Employers complaining about being unable to fill positions fell 10 percentage points to 31 percent in an annual survey of hot jobs and labor markets by employment services firm Manpower Inc ( MAN.N ), which it said reflected U.S. weakness. The poll of nearly 43,000 employers in 32 countries, found 22 percent of U.S. bosses were struggling to fill jobs, down from 41 percent in the 2007 survey, with conditions also easing in Mexico and Canada. 

 But the company said skilled staff in traditional trades such as plumbers and welders, and in areas such as sales and technicians, remained tight in most parts of the world surveyed. Engineers and sales representatives were also much sought after, as they were last year, while management recruits climbed to fifth spot from ninth last year. -- Top 10 hot jobs in 2008: (2007 ranking in brackets) 1.
