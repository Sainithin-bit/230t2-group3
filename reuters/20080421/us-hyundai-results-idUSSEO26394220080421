 SEOUL  (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor Co ( 005380.KS ), South Korea's top auto maker, is expected to post an 82 percent surge in quarterly profit, fuelled by a weaker won currency and higher sales. 

 Sales of more upmarket models such as the Genesis sedan, are likely to lift overall sales this year, especially in the higher-margin domestic market, of which Hyundai controls half. Hyundai should also benefit from new factories in China and India, although higher raw material prices may hurt. "Hyundai should show impressive growth in all markets this year," said Yoon Tae-sik, an auto analyst at Dongbu Securities. "The company is set to hold on to its position at home with the Genesis. New factories in India and China will drive higher sales there. In the U.S., preference for small cars amid weak consumer sentiment and rising oil prices will help it gain competitiveness," Yoon said. The maker of the Sonata sedan and the Santa Fe sports utility vehicle is expected to post a net profit of 559.2 billion won ($562.8 million) in the first quarter ended on March 31, a Reuters poll of 10 analysts showed. Hyundai reported a 307.4 billion won in net profit a year ago and a 338 billion won profit in the previous quarter. The firm is likely to gain 30-50 billion won during the January-March period from derivatives related to shares in affiliate Kia ( 000270.KS ), which rose 12.9 percent in the three months, analysts said, after losing 90 billion won from the derivatives last year. Hyundai's first quarter operating profit is forecast at 574.8 billion won, almost double the 291.4 billion won a year ago and compared to a 636.5 billion won profit in the last quarter. Sales are seen rising 21.4 percent to 8.11 trillion won from a year earlier. Supporting Hyundai's competitiveness was the won's value against the dollar, which at the end of March was 5 percent lower than a year earlier and 5.5 percent lower than the end of last year. That is expected to help Kia turn to an operating profit in the first quarter as overseas sales at the Hyundai affiliate account for around 80 percent of total sales. Kia is expected to post a 30 billion won in operating profit during the first quarter, compared to a 73.7 billion won loss a year earlier, according to a Reuters poll of eight analysts. But Kia is likely to report a 21.3 billion won in net loss, compared to a 30.6 billion won loss a year ago, as a weaker won boosted foreign currency debts. Hyundai this year should benefit from the weakness in the won, which will enhance its competitiveness against Japanese makers such as Toyota Motors Corp ( 7203.T ) amid a firmer yen. For 2008, Hyundai is expected to post a 31.6 percent rise in net profit to 2.21 trillion won from a 1.68 trillion won in 2007, according to a poll of 23 brokerages by Reuters Estimates. Reflecting the optimism, shares in Hyundai rose 10.2 percent in the first quarter, outperforming a 10.2 percent fall in the broader market. Hyundai's stock trades at 9.47 times forecast 2008 earnings, compared to Toyota's 9.28 times and Honda Motor Co Ltd's ( 7267.T ) 8.05 times, according to Reuters data.
