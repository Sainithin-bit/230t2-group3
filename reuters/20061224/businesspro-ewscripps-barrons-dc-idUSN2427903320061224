 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - While most newspaper company's have 
been floundering because of sagging advertising revenue and 
circulation, E.W. Scripps ( SSP.N ) has been racking up some 
healthy numbers, Barron's said in its December 25 edition. 

  Scripps, publisher of papers such as Denver's Rocky 
Mountain News, has been riding a wave of revenue from its 
relatively new collection of cable channels, such as Home and 
Garden Television (HGTV), Fine Living, and the Food Network, 
Barron's said.  The company also has one of the hottest specialized 
Internet search engines, Shopzilla.com, the only 
shopping-comparison site to break the top 10 online shopping 
destinations the day after Thanksgiving (coming in at No. 7), 
Barron's said.  Overall cash flow is expected to rise about 11 percent on 
average during the next five years on mid-single-digit revenue 
gains and earnings should compound at 16 percent on average, 
Barron's said.  Many of Scripps' businesses are posting stronger growths. 
Revenue from the networks segment rose 19 percent in the third 
quarter and cash flow jumped 32 percent.  The company's interactive-media segment grew 73 percent. 
Cash flow is expected to rise to about $65 million this year 
from $28 million and to reach a range of $80 million to $85 
million, next year, Barron's said.  Even Scripps "old media" newspapers and television stations 
are above average in the industry, Barron's said.  Prudential Equity Group sees the company's stock climbing 
to $60 per share over the next 12 months and Credit Suisse sees 
that stock at $62, Barron's said.  The stock closed at $42.23 on Friday.  "Scripps looks like a million bucks, and it's just warming 
up," Larry Haverty, media specialist and co-portfolio manager 
at Gabelli Global Multimedia Trust fund, told Barron's.
