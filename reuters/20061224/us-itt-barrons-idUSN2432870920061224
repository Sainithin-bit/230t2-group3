 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Profits of ITT Corp.( ITT.N ) could continue to grow at a double-digit clip for years to come, and the maker of defense electronics and water treatment parts could be buffeted from cyclical downturns, Barron's said in its December 25 edition. 

 ITT is the market leader in night-vision goggles for the military and has one of the largest menus of pumps and valves used for water treatment and transport, Barron's said. The company derives more than 30 percent of its revenue from the water market, where the need for clean water has generated spending for new products and services, Barron's said. The company's defense backlog, about $4 billion, is fully funded, which means steady work for at least a couple of years. That means about 80 percent of ITT's business could be independent of the business cycle, Barron's said. "If folks are concerned about economic slowdown, you'd want to own a company with (ITT's) stability," John Baliotti, FTN Midwest analyst, told Barron's. Shares of ITT on Friday closed at $56.36, near its year-high of $58.73 reached in March.
