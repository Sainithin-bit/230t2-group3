 TRIPOLI  (Reuters) - Three blocs that drew only single bidders in Libya's latest oil exploration round were awarded to Exxon, ONGC and Inpex on Sunday, the country's state National Oil Corporation said. 

 Exxon Mobil Corp. ( XOM.N ) was awarded a 22.3 percent share in four wells, India's Oil & Natural Gas Corp. ( ONGC.BO ) a 28 percent share in one well and Japan's Inpex Holdings Inc. ( 1605.T ) 12.9 percent of three wells, NOC said. Russia's Gazprom ( GAZP.MM ) and Tatneft TATN3.MM won the bulk of licences in the round last week. Libya wants to attract foreign investment to help it hike its oil output capacity to more than 3.0 million barrels (bpd) per day by 2010/12 from about 1.6 million bpd at present.
