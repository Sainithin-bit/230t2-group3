 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Aluminum producer Alcoa Inc.( AA.N ) on 
Sunday said it reached a tentative deal with United Auto 
Workers Local 1050 for a new labor contract at the company's 
Cleveland, Ohio facility, potentially ending a 7-week old 
strike. 

  The tentative deal was endorsed by the union's negotiating 
committee, the company said, and could mean 830 employees at 
the plant could return to work on January 2.  Union members plan to hold ratification meetings on 
December 27 to review the agreement's details, Alcoa said.  In November, Alcoa reached an agreement for a four-year 
contract with the International Association of Machinists at 
the Cleveland Works facility, which makes forged parts for 
cars, trucks and airplanes.  That agreement affected 45 workers and included a $1,500 
signing bonus. The UAW had rejected the same pact.
