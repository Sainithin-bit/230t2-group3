 BEIJING  (Reuters) - China's banking regulator said on 
Sunday it had granted approval for nine foreign banks to 
prepare for local registration, an initial step in granting 
national treatment. 

  The nine are Standard Chartered ( STAN.L ) ( 2888.HK ), Bank of 
East Asia ( 0023.HK ), HSBC ( HSBA.L ) ( 0005.HK ), Hang Seng Bank 
( 0011.HK ), DBS ( DBSM.SI ), Bank of Toyko-Mitsubishi, Mizuho 
Corporate Bank, Citigroup Inc. ( C.N ) and ABN AMRO AAH.AS.  The list was published on the banking regulator's Web site 
(www.cbrc.gov.cn).  The mainland issued new foreign bank guidelines on November 
16 to fulfill its obligations for entry into the World Trade 
Organization, which stipulates that the country must further 
open its banking sector to overseas competition from December 
11.
