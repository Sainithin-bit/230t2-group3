 JOHANNESBURG  (Reuters) - Rio Tinto ( RIO.AX ) ( RIO.L ), which again rejected a bid proposal from larger rival BHP Billiton ( BHP.AX )( BLT.L ) on Monday, said it has much more and better-positioned iron ore deposits than BHP. 

 "Rio Tinto has the best mineralization and land position in the Pilbara (region in Australia)," Sam Walsh, who heads Rio's iron ore unit, told an investor presentation. Rio has 14.2 billion tonnes of iron ore reserves and resources in the key Pilbara area compared to BHP's 8.0 billion tonnes, he said. In addition, Rio has better rail and port facilities and has targeted 20-30 billion tonnes of additional mineralization, Walsh added. BHP's proposal to offer three of its shares for each Rio share vastly undervalues the firm, partly due to its strong prospects in iron ore, Rio told investors. Rio boosted its global iron ore production target to 430 million tonnes a year by 2018 on Monday, up from a current target of 320 million by 2012. Rio also has a conceptual plan to further boost iron ore output to over 600 million tonnes a year eventually, from current output of around 200 million tonnes a year. "We have many, many options for future growth," Walsh said. One of the growth areas outside of Australia is the Simandou project in Guinea, where production is due to kick off at 70 million tonnes a year in 2013, with possible phased expansion to 120 million tonnes and then 170 million tonnes a year. BHP said when it presented its all-share takeover proposal that a combination of the two companies will lead to $3.7 billion in annual synergies after seven years through cost-cutting and speeding up development of mines, especially in iron ore.
