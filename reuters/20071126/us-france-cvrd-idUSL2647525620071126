 PARIS  (Reuters) - Brazilian mining giant CVRD ( VALE5.SA ) said on Monday it did not plan to invest in Rio Tinto ( RIO.L ) after the mining group rejected a proposed takeover bid by rival BHP Billiton ( BLT.L ) ( BHP.AX ). 

 "There is no intention on the part of CVRD to step in and snap up capital in Rio Tinto," Chief Executive Officer Roger Agnelli said through an interpreter. BHP made public on November 8 its plan to take over Rio and forge a mega-mining group with a market capitalization of around $350 billion and control of much of the world's iron ore, copper and aluminum. Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD) is the world's biggest producer and exporter of iron ore. "The BHP/Rio Tinto deal is justified by BHP. You want to expand your activities ... but as far as Vale is concerned they have a neutral position," Agnelli said. "It is their project, they will proceed as they see fit and of course, this should apply to Rio Tinto. Rio Tinto should proceed as they see fit," he said. CVRD also said at a news conference in Paris that even if investment into the sector continued to increase, it would not be able to meet booming demand in China. "Even if we keep investing more and more we'll never keep up with Chinese growth rate," Agnelli said. CVRD has said it plans to spend $59 billion in 2008-2012 to more than double output of copper, expand production of iron ore and nickel and develop aluminum production. It earmarked $11 billion for the first year of the five-year period. Agnelli said that $2.8 billion, or five percent of the $59 billion, would go towards environmental protection. CVRD has previously estimated that China's share of global iron ore consumption will increase from 45 percent last year to 54 percent in 2011. Nickel consumption will rise from 17.3 percent to 31 percent, aluminum from 25.5 percent to 41 percent and copper from 21 percent to 30 percent, the company has said.
