 TOULOUSE, France  (Reuters) - French workers fear the recent comments of Airbus maker EADS' ( EAD.PA ) management about the impact on the business of dollar weakness will mean more job cuts in France, trade union officials said on Monday. 

 "We are very afraid that this crisis of exchange rates will mean for us the announcement of further drastic decisions in terms of cost cuts and more offshoring," said Gilbert Plo, Airbus delegate for the CFDT union. Plo was reacting to comments about the threat from the euro's strength against the dollar made by EADS chairman Louis Gallois during a visit to Beijing. Gallois, repeating a warning made by management last week, said dollar weakness was "a vital danger, which means it is eating the margins of the company, but it's not an immediate one". Gallois said more jobs may need to be moved out of the company if the euro's strength against the dollar is not reined in. The single European currency scaled a record peak against the dollar last week. Airbus, which sells its planes in dollars, has almost half its costs in euros. Airbus already plans to reduce its overhead by 10,000 staff and 2.1 billion euros ($3.1 billion) a year under its so-called Power8 restructuring plan. It is also trying to sell six out of 16 factories to suppliers. Jean-Francois Knepper, delegate for the FO union, said the company was hiding behind the euro-dollar issue as "an excuse for all the problems of Airbus".
