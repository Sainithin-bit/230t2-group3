 (Reuters) - General Electric is well known for its training programs at its 53-acre Crotonville campus, located in Ossining, New York, about 35 miles north of New York City. 

 Below are five facts about the Crotonville facility: * Founded in 1956 to prepare 1,500 top GE managers for a restructuring; it took five years to put them all through the 13-week course. * The facility grew extensively during the 20-year-tenure of former CEO Jack Welch, and is formally named the John F. Welch Leadership Development Center. * About 10,000 people attend classes at Crotonville each year. Most are GE employees, but about 7 to 10 percent are customers. It spends about $1 billion on training its staff and another $1.5 million training customers. * Classes run from a half day to three weeks at the Crotonville campus, which features an 188-room hotel, complete with restaurant, ice cream bars and a helipad. * The social center is a two-story, yellow converted farm house -- containing bars, pool tables and other facilities -- known as "The White House."
