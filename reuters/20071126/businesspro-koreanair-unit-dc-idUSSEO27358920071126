 SEOUL  (Reuters) - Top South Korean carrier Korean Air 
( 003490.KS ) said on Monday it will set up a budget carrier next 
year with a 20 billion won ($22 million) investment, a move 
which will tap rising international travel. 

  The announcement comes after Tiger Airways, a low-fare 
airline partly-owned by Singapore Airlines ( SIAL.SI ) said 
earlier this month that it would start a new Korean budget 
airline in a joint venture with the port city of Incheon. South 
Korea's main international airport is close to the city.  Shares at Korean Air reacted positively, rising more than 7 
percent.  "Korean Air and Air Korea, a separately operated subsidiary 
will complement each other for a win-win relationship," the 
company said in a statement.  "Korean Air will concentrate on upper class business travel 
demands and Air Korea shall focus on travellers seeking shorter 
distance leisure travel routes."  The new unit will begin operation in May 2008, opening 
flights to Shandong and Hainan Provinces in China and to Japan 
except Tokyo, as well as Thailand and Malaysia.  It gradually plans to widen its network to other short- or 
mid-distance destinations.  For operations, the low-cost carrier will secure three 
Airbus ARBU.UL A300s and two Boeing ( BA.N ) B737s, which are 
short- to medium-range aircraft.  Maintenance and operation training will be outsourced to 
Korean Air.  Airline analysts, however, say it is difficult for carriers 
to successfully set up a low cost-airline within an airline 
because the two entities often end up competing against each 
other.  Shares at Korean Air jumped 7.86 percent to 70,000 won by 
0143 GMT, outperforming the wider market's  .KS11  2.97 percent 
rise.  ($1=908.9 Won)  (Reporting by Kim Yeon-hee; Additional reporting by Jon
