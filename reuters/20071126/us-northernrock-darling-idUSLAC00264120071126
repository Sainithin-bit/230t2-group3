 LONDON  (Reuters) - The terms of the Virgin Group consortium's offer for mortgage bank Northern Rock is in line with the principles the government has set out for a sale of the stricken lender, British finance minister Alistair Darling said on Monday. 

 "The confirmations given by the Virgin Consortium are in line with the principles I set out last week," Darling said in a letter to head of parliament's Treasury Committee John McFall. "Until a transaction is finalized, the government continues to keep all options open in relation to the future of Northern Rock."
