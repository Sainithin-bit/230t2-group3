 LONDON  (Reuters) - A consortium led by Virgin Group VA.UL expects to fully repay Northern Rock's NRK.L emergency loans from the Bank of England in two to three years, according to the proposed head of the bank under Virgin's offer. 

 Jayne-Anne Gadhia, chief executive of Virgin Money, said she is confident that shareholders of the ailing bank will support its offer, despite some calling for the auction to be scrapped. "This is the best deal on the table as far as I can see, for shareholders and for the survival of Northern Rock going forwards as a business. I think shareholders will want to support it," Gadhia told Reuters in an interview. Northern Rock named the Virgin consortium as its preferred bidder on Monday. Virgin has said it will immediately repay 11 billion pounds ($22 billion) of Northern Rock's loan from the BoE, which is estimated to have risen to as much as 25 billion pounds. Gadhia said the consortium had arranged a liquidity facility of up to 15 billion pounds from Citigroup ( C.N ), Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ) and a third major bank. (Reporting by  Steve Slater )
