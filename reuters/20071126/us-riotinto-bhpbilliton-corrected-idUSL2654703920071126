 (In paragraph 8, corrects to 430 million tonnes from 430 tonnes)    
   (Reuters) - Rio Tinto ( RIO.AX ) ( RIO.L ) again rebuffed an all-share bid proposal from larger rival BHP Billiton ( BHP.AX )( BLT.L ) on Monday, mapping out its own growth prospects as an independent firm. 

 Here are the main points from an investor presentation. ** Rio reiterates that BHP's three-shares-for-one proposal fundamentally undervalues Rio, saying the firm's value is not fully reflected by the market. CEO says Rio has a "tremendously higher value" than the BHP proposal, but declines to say how much. ** Rio says it is not "engaging" with any other potential suitors and shrugs off suggestion it may launch counter-bid for  BHP. ** It increases total 2007 dividend by 30 percent and promises further rises of at least 20 percent in each of following two years. ** It boosts target for divestments to at least $15 billion from $10 billion after strategic review. It says it has identified $30 billion worth of possible sell-offs, but these are not all likely to be sold since it wants good sale prices. ** The company says it has a better growth pipeline than competitors, especially in iron ore where it has 78 percent more reserves and resources than BHP in the key Pilbara region of Australia. ** It lifts its global iron ore output target to 430 tonnes a year by 2018, saying this could later rise to over 600 million tonnes from current output of 200 million tonnes. ** It increases expected post-tax synergies from its $38.1 billion takeover of Canadian aluminum producer Alcan to $940 million a year from $600 million.
