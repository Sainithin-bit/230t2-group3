 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - European plane maker Airbus ARBU.UL must make additional savings of 1.5 billion euros ($2.2 billion) due to the weak dollar exchange rate, the chief executive of parent company EADS ( EAD.PA ), Louis Gallois, said in an interview in the Monday edition of German daily Die Welt. 

 "Our savings program Power8 is meant to defend our competitiveness on the basis of a euro rate of $1.35," he said, alluding to the current rate of $1.50. "The effect of the weak dollar is plain to see. Simple arithmetic will show you that we should save another 1.5 billion euros," he said. Any euro rise by 10 cents cost Airbus, a France-based maker of large commercial jets, more than 1 billion euros in operating earnings, said Gallois, head of the European aerospace and defense group that includes Airbus. Airbus sells its planes in dollars but close to half of its costs are in euros, making the company sensitive to swings in the euro/dollar rate. On Friday, the euro hit a record high of $1.4966. The company is already struggling to recover from costly delays in its A380 superjumbo jet, which have forced it to sell plants and slash 10,000 jobs. The German IG Metall union warned EADS on Monday against overplaying the dollar fall, which it said was making executives' reactions "impossible to predict". Gallois said Airbus had hedged dollar risks on the basis of $1.25-1.30 up to mid-2010 and was taking precautions for 2011 and 2012, for which period the dollar currently stood at $1.40-1.50, resulting in ever lower profit margins. He had already said in another weekend interview that parts of Airbus's activities might have to be moved to dollar-denominated countries, as the euro rate presented an "existential threat", especially in the long term.
