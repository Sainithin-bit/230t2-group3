 BEIJING  (Reuters) - China on Monday signed a framework agreement to buy an undisclosed number of aircraft from Airbus ( EAD.PA ). 

 The Toulouse-based plane maker had been hoping to firm up a contract to sell 150 aircraft in a deal that could have been worth more than $15 billion. In the event, the only firm order announced on Monday was with China Southern Airlines Co Ltd ( 1055.HK )( 600029.SS ), which is buying 10 twin-aisle A330 aircraft in a deal worth $1.8 billion at list prices. The deals were signed as French President Nicolas Sarkozy and Chinese President Hu Jintao watched. China has also agreed to take a 5 percent risk-sharing stake in the development of the A350. The $10 billion project is Airbus's attempt to catch up with Boeing's 787 Dreamliner in the fast-growing mid-sized jetliner market. (Reporting by  Tim Hepher , editing by Ken Wills)
