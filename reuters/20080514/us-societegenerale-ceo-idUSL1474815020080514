 PARIS  (Reuters) - French bank Societe Generale ( SOGN.PA ), hit earlier this year by a rogue trader scandal, is well equipped to stay independent, new Chief Executive Frederic Oudea told French paper La Tribune. 

 "I'm convinced that Societe Generale is perfectly armed to develop in a profitable manner while remaining independent," Oudea told La Tribune in an interview published on Wednesday. Last month, speculation that the bank could become a takeover target resurfaced after CEO and Chairman Daniel Bouton, who had been a staunch defender of the French bank's independence, announced he would step down as CEO while holding on to his position as chairman. In March, SocGen's rival BNP Paribas ( BNPP.PA ) said it had decided against considering a bid, having previously said it was looking at the bank.
