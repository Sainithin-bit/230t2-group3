 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Stocks rose on Wednesday in light trading after a modest rise in consumer prices in April cooled inflation fears while Macy's Inc ( M.N ) and Freddie Mac FRE.N posted reassuring quarterly results. 

 A milder-than-expected gain in the Consumer Price Index took the edge off fears of an inflationary spurt triggered by soaring energy prices. That could allow the Federal Reserve more time to hold interest rates steady, analysts said. Shares of retailers and home builders, which benefit from steady to lower borrowing costs, advanced. The S&P retail index .RLX rose 1.6 percent, as Macy's stood by the profit forecast for its department stores despite expectations of an economic slowdown. Freddie Mac, seen as a housing market barometer, brightened the mood on Wall Street by raising its growth outlook and unveiling a plan to raise new capital to support the beleaguered home loan market. "People were nervous about the inflation number. When it was somewhat better than expected, that triggered the rally," said Eric Kuby, chief investment officer at North Star Investment Management Corp., in Chicago. Stocks pared gains late in the session, leaving the Nasdaq just barely higher. Shares of Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ) slid as investors took profits after two days of gains in the stock. The market's sharp climb "ran out of steam without another leg of news to keep the rally going," Kuby said. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  rose 66.20 points, or 0.52 percent, to end at 12,898.38. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  added 5.62 points, or 0.40 percent, to 1,408.66. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  inched up 1.58 points, or 0.06 percent, to 2,496.70. Trading was extremely light on the New York Stock Exchange, with about 1.19 billion shares changing hands, well below last year's estimated daily average of roughly 1.90 billion, and the second-lowest level of volume so far this year. NYSE trading volume hit its low for the year on Monday, when 1.05 billion shares traded hands. However, the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index .VIX, or VIX, which is Wall Street's fear barometer, slid at one point to its lowest level since October 2007 as stocks rallied. The VIX was down 1.8 percent at the close. Shares of Macy's rose 3.6 percent to $24.93. Freddie Mac, the No. 2 provider of funding for U.S. residential mortgages, shot up 9.2 percent to $27.25. The Dow Jones home construction Index .DJUSHB climbed 2.7 percent. The stock of D.R. Horton Inc ( DHI.N ), the largest U.S. home builder, jumped 2.9 percent to $15.36. APPLE FALLS, ENERGY SLIPS On the Nasdaq, shares of Apple declined 2 percent to $186.26. And the stock of top video game publisher Electronic Arts Inc ERTS.O dropped 3.3 percent to $52.78. Late Tuesday, the company issued an annual profit outlook that fell short of Wall Street forecasts. Energy companies' stocks also fell after U.S. crude slid $1.58 to settle at $124.22 per barrel, a day after it approached a record just 2 cents shy of $127. The S&P energy index .GSPE ended down 0.9 percent. Shares of Deere & Co ( DE.N ) tumbled 9.9 percent to $81.25 and ranked among the top drags on the S&P 500 after the farm and construction machinery company warned that higher material costs and possible shortages of components will affect results Among other drags on Nasdaq: Whole Foods Market Inc WFMI.O sank 13.9 percent to $28.96 after it posted a lower quarterly net profit that missed analysts' estimates. Before the opening bell, the Labor Department said the overall CPI for April rose 0.2 percent -- less than economists expected. Core CPI, excluding volatile food and energy costs, gained 0.1 percent in April -- also below forecast. The Fed's seven rate cuts, amounting to 3.25 percentage points, have now taken the Fed's benchmark fed funds rate down to 2 percent. The Fed's most recent rate decision, which analysts speculated could be the last for the near term, was on April 30. (Editing by  Jan Paschal )
