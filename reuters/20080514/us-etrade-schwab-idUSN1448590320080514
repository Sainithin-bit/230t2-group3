 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of online broker E*Trade Financial Corp ( ETFC.O ) surged on Wednesday after the company delivered higher April trading volume than analysts had expected. 

 E*Trade reported lower but better-than-expected numbers, sending its shares up over 5.5 percent. Meanwhile, Charles Schwab Corp SCHW.O, the largest online broker, also reported lower figures, but in line with analyst estimates. In a monthly report, E*Trade said daily average trading volume fell 1.6 percent in April from March to 180,970 trades, while Schwab saw average trading volume drop 8 percent to 295,500 per day. Analyst Richard Repetto of Sandler O'Neill and Partners said E*Trade's trading volume declined less than the industry average, which fell 2.4 percent. E*Trade also brought in more new trading accounts than analysts had expected, Repetto said. While new accounts fell by 6,000 in April, that included a loss of 24,000 accounts from the sale of retirement planner Retirement Advisors of America. "Excluding the sale of a business, they brought in roughly 18,000 new accounts -- well above the 6,000 or so they brought in last month." Repetto said. E*Trade finalized the sale of Retirement Advisors of America to PHH Investments Ltd on April 11th. According to the company, the sale resulted in the departure of $2.3 billion in customer assets. The company has taken steps to sell off non-core assets to focus on its online brokerage business and to help strengthen a balance sheet damaged by the subprime mortgage crisis. E*Trade reported losses for the past two quarters. Meanwhile, Schwab's April results were in line with analyst estimates. Schwab's daily average revenue trading (DART) numbers fell 7 percent to 250,600, near the high end of the 2.5 to 7.5 percent range predicted by Sandler O'Neill. Schwab received about $3.8 billion worth of net new assets under management, well below the $17.7 billion recorded in March. Schwab attributed the lower number to clients withdrawing cash to pay taxes. In afternoon Nasdaq trading, E*Trade shares were up 22 cents or 5.7 percent to $4.11 and Schwab shares were off 1 cent to $22.29. (Reporting by  Steven Bertoni , editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
