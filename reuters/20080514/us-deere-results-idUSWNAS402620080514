 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Deere & Co ( DE.N ) reported higher quarterly earnings on Wednesday as soaring crop prices boosted global demand for its agricultural equipment. 

 The company, the world's largest maker of tractors and combines, said profit rose 22 percent to $763.5 million, or $1.74 a share, in the second quarter ended on April 30, from $623.6 million, or $1.36 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 18 percent to $8.1 billion. Analysts on average had expected the Moline, Illinois-based company to report earnings of $1.74 a share on revenue of $7.62 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Deere and rival farm equipment makers CNH Global NV CNH.N and Agco Corp ( AG.N ) are enjoying record demand for their products thanks to the surge in investment in biofuels as well as increased consumption in the developing world.
