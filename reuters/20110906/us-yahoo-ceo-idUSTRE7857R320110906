 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc Chief Executive Carol Bartz on Tuesday said she had been fired over the phone by Chairman Roy Bostock, a source familiar with the matter quoted an internal company email as saying. 

 A second source said that Bartz had been dismissed by the board and replaced, on an interim basis, by Chief Financial Officer Tim Morse. That followed a report by tech blog AllThingsD, which cited company sources. Yahoo representatives were not immediately available for comment. (Editing by Carol Bishopric)
