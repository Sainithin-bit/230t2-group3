 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - With benchmark interest rates already virtually at zero, the Federal Reserve is trying new ways to make policy more accommodative and boost the economy, a top policy-maker of the U.S. central bank said on Saturday. 

 Charles Evans, president of the Chicago Federal Reserve Bank, said economic models taking into account forecasts for rising unemployment, a bigger output gap and falling industrial production would point to a need for interest rates below zero. "If it were not constrained by zero those models would want to push it below zero, but that's not possible," Evans told reporters after a panel discussion in San Francisco. Quantitative easing now being done by the Fed "is a way to mimic below-zero rates and provide support to the economy." (Editing by Leslie Adler)
