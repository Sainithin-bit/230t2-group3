 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Close collaboration between the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve to fight the country's economic crisis has been crucial but raises questions over Fed independence, a top Fed policy-maker said on Saturday. 

 "We are blurring the institutional arrangements a little," said St Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard. "I am concerned about independence. Fed independence is very important," he told reporters on the sidelines of the annual American Economics Association meeting. (Reporting by  Alister Bull , editing by Leslie Adler)
