 FARMINGDALE, New York  (Reuters) - Former world number one Vijay Singh was reluctant to comment on Saturday following the indictment of Texas billionaire Allen Stanford on fraud, conspiracy and obstruction charges the previous day. 

 Singh, a three-times major winner, had an endorsement deal with Stanford and is the global ambassador for a charity initiative on the PGA Tour created by Stanford Financial Group. Stanford, three associates and a top Caribbean regulator have been linked by U.S. Justice Department officials to an elaborate $7 billion pyramid scheme to bilk investors. "I don't really want to talk about that at all," Singh told Reuters when asked to give his reaction to Stanford's indictment. The smooth-swinging Fijian is competing in this week's U.S. Open at Bethpage Black where he has been wearing a golf shirt and golf cap with a Stanford logo. Although his endorsement deal also included a golf bag emblazoned with a Stanford logo, Singh used a different bag for the U.S. Open second round when he carded a two-over-par 72. EXPRESSED ASTONISHMENT Earlier this year, Singh expressed astonishment as fallout from U.S. fraud charges against Stanford rippled across the globe. "I am just surprised by it all," the 46-year-old told Reuters at the Northern Trust Open in Los Angeles in February. "He has done so much for charity and St Jude is his big thing. I hope everything will be okay once they find out what's going on." Eagles for St. Jude, set up by Stanford Financial Group, raises money from every eagle recorded on the PGA Tour in donations to St. Jude, one of the world's premier pediatric cancer research centers. Singh, along with fellow players Camilo Villegas and Morgan Pressel, has heavily promoted the program and last year donated $300,000 to St. Jude for the eagles he personally carded on the 2008 Tour. Asked whether he had any concerns over his endorsement deal with Stanford, Singh replied: "We are assuming a lot. It's all assumption at the moment and I have really nothing more I can say about it."
