 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - Dutch brewer Heineken ( HEIN.AS ) said on Tuesday its bid for Tiger beer maker Asia Pacific Breweries APBB.SI shares held by Fraser and Neave ( FRNM.SI ) was "richer" and created more value for investors than a sweetened offer from a rival Thai group. 
 "We are convinced that our bid is richer and offers more value to shareholders," a Heineken spokesman told ANP-Reuters. Thailand's Kindest Place Groups earlier on Tuesday made an unsolicited offer of S$55 a share to buy Singapore conglomerate Fraser and Neave's (F&N) direct 7.3 percent stake in APB.
