 (Reuters) - Consumer goods maker Church & Dwight Co Inc ( CHD.N ) reported quarterly revenue that missed market expectations on lower sales of its higher-margin personal care products in the United States, and forecast a third-quarter profit below estimates. 
 The company, known for its Arm & Hammer brands, expects to earn about 58 cents per share for the third quarter. Analysts on average were expecting 61 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The maker of Trojan condoms and XTRA detergent said net income fell to $79.3 million, or 56 cents per share, for the second quarter from $82.6 million, or 57 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected earnings of 55 cents per share for the third quarter. Revenue rose 3.2 percent to $696.4 million, but fell short of estimates of $702.7 million. Personal care products sales fell 5 percent to $160.3 million. Shares of the Princeton, New Jersey-based company closed at $55.7 on Monday on the New York Stock Exchange.
