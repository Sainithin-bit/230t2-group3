 (Reuters) - Trust in business rose modestly worldwide last year, led by sharp gains in the United States, Italy and Spain. Trust in business deteriorated, albeit from higher levels, in emerging markets Russia, Brazil and India, the Edelman Trust Barometer found. 

 The survey asked informed adults in 22 countries whether they trusted business. Below are highlights of their responses, gathered in late 2009, from 10 large economies, compared with prior-year results.
