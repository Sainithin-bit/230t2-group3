 JEDDAH  (Reuters) - Saudi Arabian Mining Company (Maaden) 1211.SE has awarded a $1.5 billion contract to South Korea's Hyundai Engineering & Construction Co. ( 000720.KS ) to build an aluminum refinery in the kingdom, a bourse statement said on Sunday. 
 The refinery, to be constructed in the Eastern Province, will have an annual production capacity of 1.8 million metric tons of smelter-grade alumina and is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2014, the statement to Saudi Arabia's stock exchange said. "The contract includes completing detailed engineering, procurement, construction, pre-commissioning, commissioning assistance, start-up assistance and training services," Maaden added. In March, the firm agreed a draft deal with Hyundai to build the refinery, part of a multibillion dollar complex in Ras Al Khair that is 74.9-percent owned by Maaden and 25.1 percent by Alcoa Inc ( AA.N ).
