 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Euro zone economic sentiment deteriorated much more than expected in February but inflation expectations were stable, even though data confirmed that food and energy costs fuelled a record surge in inflation in January. 

 The European Commission's monthly economic sentiment survey showed sentiment declined to 100.1 in February from 101.7 in January -- a much steeper fall than the decline to 101.2 expected by economists. It was driven by declining optimism in the euro zone's services sector, which generates more than two thirds of the 15-member area's gross domestic product. Industry and construction sentiment also deteriorated, while consumer optimism remained stable. The only sector to record an improvement in sentiment was retail. The Commission survey showed that inflation expectations among consumers -- an indicator closely watched by the European Central Bank -- were unchanged for the fourth month in a row at 28 points, above the long-term average of 23 points. Selling-price expectations among businesses were also stable at 14 points, the survey showed. The ECB, which wants inflation to be just below 2 percent, has said that anchoring inflation expectations was key to tame price growth after it took off in the last months of 2007. The European Union's statistics office said on Friday prices in the euro zone fell 0.4 percent in January against December for a year-on-year rise of 3.2 percent -- confirming its earlier annual estimate and market expectations. The annual gain was mainly a result of soaring energy prices, which rose 10.6 percent and more expensive food, which rose 4.8 percent year-on-year, as expected by economists. Without the volatile unprocessed food and energy costs, or what the ECB calls core inflation, prices fell 0.8 percent month-on-month for a 2.3 percent year-on-year gain. Core inflation measure helps the ECB establish how much the rises in the volatile components influence prices in other sectors -- an indication of so-called second-round inflation effects, which also include inflation-induced wage hikes. The ECB has been calling for wages to grow no more than productivity, but with unemployment in the euro zone at a record low of 7.1 percent in January, according to Eurostat, pressure for higher wage settlements is growing.
