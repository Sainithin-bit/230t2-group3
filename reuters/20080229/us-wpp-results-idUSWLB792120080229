 LONDON  (Reuters) - WPP ( WPP.L ), the world's second-largest advertising and marketing company, posted on Friday 2007 like-for-like revenue growth of 5 percent, in line with forecasts, and said 2008 should be better than 2007. 

 WPP, whose agencies include JWT and Young & Rubicam, reported revenues of 6.19 billion pounds ($12.30 billion pounds), in line with expectations, and adjusted pretax profit of 817 million pounds, ahead of analyst forecasts at 811 million pounds. It said the operating margin targets of 15.5 percent for 2008 and 16 percent for 2009 would remain. "We have only preliminary data for January in 2008 and this shows like-for-like revenues up 5 percent," the company said. "On the basis of these data, 2008 should be a better year than 2007, against the views of most economic forecasters, who predict a gloomy 2008." (Reporting by  Kate Holton ; Editing by Gavin Haycock)
