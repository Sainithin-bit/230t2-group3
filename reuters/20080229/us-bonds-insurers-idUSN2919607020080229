 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Billionaire Wilbur Ross has agreed to invest up to $1 billion in Assured Guaranty Ltd ( AGO.N ), sidelining big bond insurers like Ambac Financial Group Inc ABK.N in favor of a rival that has largely avoided the credit problems plaguing the industry. 

 The move was a disappointment to investors hoping Ross would help rescue Ambac, after reports last month that the tycoon was eyeing an investment in the second-largest bond insurer. Adding to concern about Ambac, CNBC said on Friday that talks to raise more capital for the company had stalled. Ambac's shares fell nearly 6 percent, while Assured Guaranty rose 14 percent. Ross told Reuters that he had chosen Assured Guaranty because it needs capital to pursue new business, rather than to cure damage. But he added that he was still in conversations with other bond insurers. Assured Guaranty refrained from insuring risky repackaged subprime mortgage bonds in recent years. Competitors are expected to incur billions of dollars of losses from guaranteeing these instruments, known as collateralized debt obligations of asset-backed securities. "What Ross is seeing is a great opportunity to make a lot of money with a virtually clean company that needs capital to expand, not to keep a rating," Morningstar analyst Jim Ryan said. "It's a totally different story from Ambac." Assured Guaranty made the Ross announcement ahead of a widely anticipated letter to investors from Berkshire Hathaway Inc ( BRKa.N ) Chief Executive Warren Buffett, another high-profile investor who has been trying to profit from the bond insurers' woes. Buffett's annual letter, to be issued later on Friday, may offer clues on his next step in that business after he recently started up his own municipal bond insurance company. SECTOR WOES Several bond insurers are facing trouble as expected losses from insuring collateralized debt obligations have threatened their top ratings. Several are looking to boost their capital levels or reorganize their businesses. MBIA Inc ( MBI.N ) has raised more than $2.5 billion from investors this year, and this week had its top credit ratings affirmed by Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service. Other bond insurers, like Ambac, are still working to raise funds. Although sources last week said a deal for Ambac could come as early as this week, CNBC said on Friday that conversations had hit a significant snag: Rating agencies are calling for banks to inject more capital than they had originally planned. The deal is still far from dead, and could happen as early as next week, CNBC added. Wilbur Ross agreed to buy $250 million of common shares of Assured and committed to purchase up to $750 million in additional stock at the company's option. Ambac's shares were down 67 cents, or 5.7 percent, at $11.13, while Assured Guaranty rose $3.18 to $25.96 in morning New York Stock Exchange trading.
