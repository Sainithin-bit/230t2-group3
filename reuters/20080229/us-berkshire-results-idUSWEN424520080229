 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc ( BRKa.N ) ( BRKb.N ) said on Friday fourth-quarter profit fell 18 percent, hurt by lower earnings from insurance underwriting and a decrease in investment gains. 

 Net income for the Omaha, Nebraska-based insurance and investment company fell to $2.95 billion, or $1,904 per Class A share, from $3.58 billion, or $2,323, a year earlier. Operating profit, excluding investments, also fell 18 percent to $2.35 billion, or $1,518 per share, from $2.87 billion, or $1,859, a year earlier. Analysts, on average, expected profit of $1,695 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel; Editing by  Braden Reddall )
