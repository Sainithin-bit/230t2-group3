 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Bankrupt auto parts maker Delphi Corp DPHIQ.PK has sought a two-month extension on its right to complete its reorganization without interference from others but still expects to emerge by the end of March, a company spokesman said on Friday. 

 Delphi sought the extension until May 31 in a filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York on Thursday, citing capital markets turbulence that has made an exit financing deal difficult to complete, among other factors. The auto parts maker said in the court papers it sought the extension out of an "abundance of caution" and it expects the plan would become effective "as soon as reasonably practicable." Delphi, which filed for bankruptcy in October 2005, has been divesting businesses and cutting thousands of hourly and salaried workers in its reorganization.
