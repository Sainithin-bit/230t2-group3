 PARIS  (Reuters) - The head of French media conglomerate Vivendi ( VIV.PA ) said on Friday it was legitimate for Vivendi to look at other companies such as Germany's largest pay-TV broadcaster Premiere PREGn.DE. 

 Asked if Vivendi was interested in discussing a potential tie with Premiere, Chief Executive Jean-Bernard Levy told a news conference: "It's certainly legitimate for us to look at our neighbors. It's normal that we look." Bertrand Meheut, the chief executive of Canal Plus, Vivendi's pay-TV unit, was also asked if Vivendi was looking at Premiere. He said: "If the opportunity occurred, yes" Last month Jean-Bernard Levy told the Financial Times that Premiere was a "natural potential target" but only if the conditions were right for a successful investment. Levy had also said that Vivendi had been looking at Premiere repeatedly. (Reporting by  Astrid Wendlandt , Dominique Vidalon; Editing by David Cowell)
