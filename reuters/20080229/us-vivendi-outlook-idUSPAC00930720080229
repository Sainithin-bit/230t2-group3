 PARIS  (Reuters) - French media group Vivendi ( VIV.PA ) expects its sales to rise to about 30 billion euros ($45.31 billion) in 2009, against 21.657 billion in 2007. 

 On slides handed out at a news conference on the 2007 results, Vivendi said it aimed at 3-4 percent in sales growth at its Canal Plus pay-television unit in 2008 while revenue at SFR Mobile would grow slightly. The EBITA at SFR Mobile was seen almost flat in 2008 despite higher depreciation. (Reporting by  Marcel Michelson )
