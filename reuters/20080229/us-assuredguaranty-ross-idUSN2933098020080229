 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Wilbur Ross said on Friday that he remained in talks to invest in troubled bond insurance companies, and his agreement to invest up to $1 billion into Assured Guaranty ( AGO.N ) would let the bond insurer expand through acquisition. 

 Ross, who made his fortune snapping up textile, coal and steel companies when they were beaten down, said Assured was a more solid company that could use capital to expand. More-troubled bond insurers, such as MBIA Inc ( MBI.N ) and Ambac Financial Group Inc ABK.N, have been seeking capital to protect credit ratings threatened by heavy mortgage-related losses. Through Assured, Ross told Reuters, he would "probably" end up putting money into bond insurers, although he declined to identify potential investments. He had been expected to announce a big investment in one of the other, better-known insurers. "The idea of this capital is to reposition the company, not to simply patch a hole. That's what makes it different," Ross said in a telephone interview. "It does not mean we may not, through this entity, end up putting money into some of the others. We probably will."
