 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A congressman from Kansas, where Boeing Co ( BA.N ) has a major plant, said on Friday he was "deeply troubled" by an Air Force decision to award a big refueling aircraft contract to two rival aircraft companies -- Northrop Grumman ( NOC.N ) and EADS ( EAD.PA ). 

 "I will work to ensure this decision is thoroughly reviewed at the highest levels of the Pentagon and Congress. At the end of this laborious process, I hope the Air Force reverses its decision," said Kansas Republican Rep. Todd Tiahrt. He represents Wichita where Boeing has a large plant that would have done much work on the Air Force aerial tanker. (Reporting by  Kevin Drawbaugh ; editing by Carol Bishopric)
