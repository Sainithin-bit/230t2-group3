 LONDON  (Reuters) - Insurer Pearl and its target and rival Resolution ( RSL.L ) confirmed their commitment to a 4.9 billion pound ($9.7 billion) takeover deal on Friday, after a string of delays prompted speculation it could be derailed. 

 The acquisition of Resolution by its arch-rival, agreed last November, has been plagued by uncertainty and postponed at least three times -- once over legal issues and twice as Pearl sought more information from Resolution for its talks with the Financial Services Authority. "Resolution and Pearl confirm their commitment to the acquisition and expect that the current period of uncertainty for Resolution investors and policyholders will be brought to an end quickly and positively in a manner that satisfies all stakeholders," the two sides said in a joint statement. After weeks of wrangling, with market talk of funding worries and disagreements over documentation hitting the shares, the two sides said they were "working closely together" to hand the FSA the necessary papers. "Pearl is now confident that it will be able to provide the vast majority of the required information to the (Financial Services Authority) by Friday 7th March 2008," the two said. The FSA has up to three months after that date to consider Pearl's application to buy Resolution, but the watchdog has indicated it could complete the process more swiftly. Resolution shares, which dropped to 644 pence after the third delay, rose on the statement to end the day up 3.1 percent at 690p, still shy of Pearl's 720p per share cash offer. Pearl, run by pizza-to-pubs entrepreneur Hugh Osmond, and Resolution, founded by Clive Cowdery, have been bitter rivals, competing to buy up life funds and gain economies of scale. The deal was initially expected to complete in February. (Reporting by  Clara Ferreira-Marques , editing by Will Waterman)
