 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Air Force said on Friday it had picked a transatlantic team led by Northrop Grumman, instead of Boeing, to start building a new aerial refueling fleet in a surprise choice worth about $35 billion. 

 Northrop Grumman Corp ( NOC.N ) and its European partner, Airbus parent EADS ( EAD.PA ), "clearly provided the best value to the government," Sue Payton, the Air Force's chief weapons buyer, told reporters at a briefing. The contract is to supply up to 179 tanker aircraft in a deal valued at about $35 billion over the next 15 years, the Air Force said in a statement. The aircraft will replace Eisenhower-era KC-135 tankers built by Boeing Co ( BA.N ). Northrop shares rose as much as 6 percent in extended trading from their $78.61 close on the New York Stock Exchange, while Boeing slipped 3 percent to $80 per share. The initial contract for the newly named KC-45 tanker is for four test aircraft for $1.5 billion. The program marks the first stage of a multi-decade plan to replace more than 500 KC-135 tankers used to extend the range of fighter jets and other warplanes. With follow-on orders and in-service maintenance, it could be the second costliest military purchase over decades, topped only by Lockheed Martin Corp's ( LMT.N ) F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Future phases of the purchase could bring the cost of the entire fleet to more than $100 billion, although the winner of this competition is not assured of winning future ones, Air Force officials said. Boeing's KC-767 had been widely predicted to win the initial contract, partly because it had a greater amount of U.S. domestic production compared with the Northrop-EADS aircraft, based on the Airbus A330 airliner. "I am extremely surprised," said Loren Thompson of the Lexington Institute, a prominent defense analyst. "To get this outcome, Northrop Grumman had to convince the Air Force to consider the aerial refueling mission in a new way. Their analysis must have been compelling." The U.S. Air Force calls the new tanker fleet its top acquisition priority. In 2004, the U.S. Congress killed an earlier $23.5 billion Air Force plan to lease and then buy 100 modified Boeing 767 tankers amid a Pentagon procurement scandal brought to light chiefly by Sen. John McCain of Arizona, the all-but certain Republican nominee for U.S. president. (Reporting by Jim Wolf, editing by Tim Dobbyn)
