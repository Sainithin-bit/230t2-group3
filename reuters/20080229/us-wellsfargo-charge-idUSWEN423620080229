 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co, the fifth-largest U.S. bank, said on Friday it has recorded a $39 million loss tied to some complex debt that has lost value and which is held by its money market mutual funds. 

 In its annual report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Wells Fargo said the loss relates to a capital support agreement for up to $130 million related to one structured investment vehicle held by some money funds that invest in non-government securities. The San Francisco-based bank said it entered the agreement about a month ago to preserve the "triple-A" investment ratings for some of the funds. Wells Fargo said the $39 million liability reflects the guarantee it provided. The bank said it has about $106 billion of assets in money market mutual funds. A Wells Fargo spokeswoman had no immediate comment. Wells Fargo joins several other companies with mutual fund operations to bail out or support money funds stuck with debt that became illiquid or quickly lost value, including Bank of America Corp, Janus Capital Group Inc Legg Mason Inc and Wachovia Corp. Structured investment vehicles are off-balance-sheet entities that raise funding by issuing short-term debt and longer-term capital, and invest proceeds in such things as bank debt and asset-backed securities. Many have lost value as investors shunned complex debt and halted short-term funding, resulting in losses from forced asset sales. Money funds are designed to maintain a constant $1 per share net asset value, and not lose investor principal. While fund sponsors need not make up investment losses, many do so to avoid investor redemptions and a loss of reputation. Wells Fargo said that by February 1, its money funds held three SIVs totaling $1 billion. In late-afternoon trading, Wells Fargo shares traded down $1.34, or 4.4 percent, at $29.22 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel, editing by Gerald E.
