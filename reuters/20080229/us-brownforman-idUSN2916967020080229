 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Wine and spirits company Brown-Forman Corp ( BFb.N ) posted a lower-than-expected quarterly profit on Friday, hurt by higher grain costs and weakness in its Southern Comfort brand. 

 The company, which sells Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey, Finlandia Vodka and other brands, also cut the top end of its full-year earnings-per-share forecast range, citing expected higher grain and energy costs and a "challenging economic environment." Brown-Forman shares were off almost 4 percent Friday morning on the New York Stock Exchange. The company said net income for its third quarter ended January 31 was $116 million, or 94 cents per share, compared with $105.1 million, or 85 cents per share, a year before. Income from continuing operations was 93 cents a share. That was below the consensus analyst estimate of 98 cents a share, Kaumil Gajrawala, analyst at UBS, said in a research note. "Weakness was driven by a combination of slowing volume growth in core brands and rising input costs," Gajrawala said. Net sales rose 16 percent to $877.4 million. But sales were up only 4 percent excluding the benefit from the weak dollar, sales from the Casa Herradura tequila brand that was acquired in 2007 and the impact of changes in global trade inventories, the company said. Shipments from wholesalers to retail customers, a key measure for a spirits maker, of Jack Daniel's grew at a low-single-digit rate in the quarter, with volume growth improving in the low-single digits in the United States and increasing in the mid-single digits internationally, Brown-Forman said. Southern Comfort shipments from wholesalers to retailers declined for the three-month period, with weakness in both the U.S. and international markets, the company said. The company said it now expects full-year earnings per share of $3.42 to $3.50 in 2008, compared with its previous forecast of $3.42 to $3.54 per share. Brown-Forman shares were down $2.46, or 3.7 percent, at  $63.61. (Additional reporting by  Nicole Maestri  and  Martinne Geller , editing by Mark Porter and Dave Zimmerman)
