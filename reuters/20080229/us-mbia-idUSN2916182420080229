 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - MBIA Inc ( MBI.N ) anticipates that its cash flow from operations and capital resources will meet its estimated operating cash requirements in 2008, according to a filing on Friday. 

 The company expects that in 2008 it will be required to make loss payments, before reinsurance, of between $700 million and $800 million, primarily related to insured credits in the residential mortgage-backed securities and home equity sectors. The world's largest bond insurer, which recently raised capital as expected payouts on subprime mortgage bonds increased, also replaced its chief executive last week.
