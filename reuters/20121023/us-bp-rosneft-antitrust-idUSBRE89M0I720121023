 MOSCOW  (Reuters) - Russia's government has no objections to Rosneft's ( ROSN.MM ) deal to buy TNK-BP TNBP.MM on anti-trust grounds, Interfax reported the country's economy Minister Andrei Belousov saying on Tuesday. 
 Rosneft on Monday tightened its grip on Russia's oil industry with a $55 billion deal to buy TNK-BP that also makes Britain's BP ( BP.L ) a one-fifth shareholder in the state-controlled company. (Reporting By  Megan Davies ; editing by  Melissa Akin )
