 MOSCOW  (Reuters) - Rosneft's ( ROSN.MM ) deal to buy TNK-BP TNBP.MM may limit the Russian oil giant's ability to do future major acquisitions, Interfax reported citing Russia's anti-trust service FAS. 
 Rosneft on Monday tightened its grip on Russia's oil industry with a $55 billion deal to buy TNK-BP that also makes Britain's BP ( BP.L ) a one-fifth shareholder in the state-controlled company. (Reporting By  Megan Davies ; editing by  Melissa Akin )
