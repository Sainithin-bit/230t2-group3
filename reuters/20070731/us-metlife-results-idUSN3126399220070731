 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - MetLife Inc ( MET.N ), the largest U.S. life insurer, said on Tuesday net income jumped 83 percent in the second quarter as total assets got a strong boost from joint venture income, and it raised its outlook. 

 Despite the upbeat surprise, MetLife's stock rose only modestly amid concerns that the investment income gains could not be replicated given troubles in the subprime and other credit markets, one analyst said. The insurer said its variable investment income was $220 million higher than planned, driven by record corporate joint venture income. Total net investment income was $4.8 billion, up from $4.2 billion. "With that big of a number, we need to dig in and see where it came from," said analyst Craig Weber of Celent LLC. Analysts have been grilling insurers on their subprime exposure at every opportunity. MetLife's net earnings rose to $1.13 billion, or $1.48 a share, from $617 million, or 80 cents a share, in the 2006 second quarter. Operating earnings, which exclude investments, also climbed, to $1.31 billion or $1.72 a share, from $984 million or $1.28 a share over the same period. Analysts, on average, had expected the New York-based insurer to earn $1.33 a share from operations, according to Reuters Estimates. MetLife raised its forecast for full-year operating earnings to a range of $5.65 to $5.80 a share, from its previous estimate of $5.05 to $5.30 a share. MetLife's investment income got a strong boost from joint ventures with hedge funds and private equity funds, and the company has said it plans to increase its stake in such ventures. MetLife has said it would double the percentage of its assets invested in private equity and hedge funds to 2.5 percent, because they tend to offer higher returns. Retirement and savings earnings climbed 35 percent from a year ago, and total assets for the unit reached a new high of $124.4 billion, the insurer said. Earnings from annuities -- retirement products with guaranteed payouts -- grew 31 percent. MetLife even saw profits rise 9 percent in its auto and home segment. Auto and home insurance is under pressure because of increasing competition, particularly from direct marketers who sell through television and the Internet. MetLife's shares rose modestly in aftermarket trading to $60.50 from their close at $60.22 on the New York Stock Exchange. In the last 12 months, MetLife have risen 17 percent compared to an 8 percent gain in the Standard & Poor's insurance index .GSPINSC. (Reporting by Ed Leefeldt)
