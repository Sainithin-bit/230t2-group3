 NEW YORK/CALGARY  (Reuters) - Marathon Oil Corp ( MRO.N ) said on Tuesday it agreed to buy Canada's Western Oil Sands Inc.WTO.TO for about $5.56 billion, giving the U.S. oil company a foothold in one of the world's most promising streams of new crude oil. 

 Marathon said it will pay about $3.6 billion in cash plus 34.3 million shares or securities exchangeable for shares. It will also assume about $650 million of debt. Houston-based Marathon -- which also posted a higher-than-expected second quarter profit -- has been looking for a partner in the Canadian oil sands for two years. Still, it is expensive and requires special equipment to turn the tar-like sludge that comes from the region -- called bitumen -- into usable fuel. And analysts said other bidders may emerge. Marathon has plans to link the Canadian fields with its refining operations in the United States. Marathon's refining operations are "well positioned to provide both near and long-term solutions to maximize the value of these substantial bitumen resources," said Chief Executive Clarence Cazalot in a statement. "We are joining an ongoing and expanding project with strong partners, and collectively, we will be able to apply our technical and commercial skills to maximize both the recovery and value of these resources," he said. The deal also requires Western to spin-off its subsidiary with interests in Iraq's Kurdistan region -- WesternZagros -- before the deal closes, Marathon said. "The size of it is very digestible for Marathon but it gives them an entree into one of the last frontiers on the globe for the oil business," said James Halloran, energy analyst with National City Private Client Group, which manages about $35 billion in assets. "(Canada) has reduced political risk and it's a place where in the long run the major oil companies have got to be," he said. MORE BIDDERS COULD EMERGE Western has a 20 percent stake in the massive Athabasca Oil Sands Project that is 60 percent owned by Royal Dutch Shell ( RDSa.L ). Chevron Corp. ( CVX.N ) owns the remaining stake. They plan to boost output from the Northern Alberta operations to 770,000 barrels a day over the next several years, nearly quadrupling the current capacity of about 200,000 barrels a day. Analysts had considered the other partners to be potential bidders for Western, which put itself up for sale in November as shareholders pressured the company due to its flagging stock price. Mark Friesen, an analyst with FirstEnergy Capital, said another bidder may still emerge for the company. He had initially valued the firm to be worth about C$40 per share. Marathon is paying around C$35.50 per Western share in the deal. "There's a possibility of another bid," he said "It's not a done deal yet." Andrew Potter, an analyst with UBS Securities wrote in a note that the break fee, amounting to a relatively light C$1.23 a share, may also encourage a rival offer. Marathon said it would get access to proved mining reserves of 436 million barrels of bitumen through the deal and a total net resource of 2.6 billion barrels of bitumen that can be recovered through mining or "in situ" processing, which uses heat or solvents to remove the bitumen. Marathon earned $2.25 a share in the second quarter, beating out the average forecast of Wall Street analysts on strong profits from its refineries. Analysts had expected about $2.13 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. The second quarter was a mixed bag for the integrated oil sector as soaring refining margins were offset by lower commodity prices and output at some large oil companies. (Reporting by Michael Erman)
