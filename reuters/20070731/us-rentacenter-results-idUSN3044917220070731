 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Rent-A-Center Inc. ( RCII.O ) posted a higher quarterly profit on Monday, but cut its targets for the second half of the year due to economic pressure on customers, sending its shares down 4 percent. 

 The largest rent-to-own company in the United States said net profit in the second quarter was $41.3 million, or 58 cents per share, compared with $39.8 million, or 56 cents per share, a year earlier. Total revenue was $724.2 million, a 24.1 percent increase from the previous year. Same-store sales, at outlets open at least a year, rose 2.7 percent. Chief Executive Mark E. Speese cautioned that the tough financial outlook facing customers was causing the company to lower its guidance for the rest of 2007. "We will continue to invest in our core business and carry out initiatives to improve execution at the store level as we work our way through what we believe will be a temporarily difficult period," said Speese. The company is expecting third-quarter revenue of $695 million and $710 million and same store sales to be unchanged to down 1.5 percent. Total revenue for the year is expected to be $2.905 billion to $2.935 billion and diluted earnings per share of $2.06 to $2.14. This is down from the previous forecast of $2.915 billion to $2.955 billion in revenue and earnings per share of $2.24 to $2.32. Full-year same store sales are expected to rise 1 percent to 2 percent. Rent-A-Center shares fell to $23.15 in after-hours trade from a close of $24.12 on Nasdaq.
