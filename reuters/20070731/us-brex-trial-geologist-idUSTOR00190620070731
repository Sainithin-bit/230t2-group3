 TORONTO  (Reuters) - John Felderhof, the lone remaining key figure in the multibillion-dollar Bre-X gold fraud, was found not guilty on Tuesday of insider trading and misleading investors in the only prosecution brought in the greatest mining scam of all time. 

 The Ontario Securities Commission, Canada's main market regulator, accused him in 1999 of four counts of each charge, saying he illegally sold C$84 million (now worth $79 million) of Bre-X stock in 1996, and issued misleading press releases touting the property's rich gold content. Soon after, independent surveys showed the company's much-touted Busang gold deposit in Indonesia was worthless. Shares of the company, which had soared to value the firm at around C$6 billion, collapsed to nothing, costing thousands of investors their savings, and leaving ruined shareholders to sell their stock certificates off as bitter souvenirs to a public fascinated by the story. But Judge Peter Hryn said the OSC failed to prove that Felderhof should have known that samples from the site were faulty. "I prefer the evidence that there were not red flags that should have been apparent to Felderhof," Hryn told a Toronto courtroom packed with reporters. He said that the tampering of samples was sophisticated and took place over sufficient time as to make the results plausible and reasonable to people involved. Felderhof, who would have faced up to two years in prison and a fine for each count, was not in court. He is believed to be living in Bali, although his wife said in a published interview this week she thought he was living in Canada. Speaking after the verdict, his lawyer said the decision should help restore Felderhof's reputation. "The fact that many investors have singled him out and have said that he's the one to blame has been an enormous struggle for him," said Joe Groia. FROM CALGARY TO INDONESIA Bre-X, which began its life in 1989 as a small Calgary, Alberta-based explorer, claimed in the mid-1990s it had made a massive gold find in Indonesia. The company said in 1995 the deposit could contain more than 30 million ounces, then raised that estimate to 57 million ounces, and then to 70 million ounces after agreeing in 1997 to partner with U.S. miner Freeport-McMoRan ( FCX.N ) to develop the project. Felderhof was even more optimistic, saying the area could hold as much as 200 million ounces of gold. But things began to fall apart after reports emerged that Freeport's tests of the site did not match Bre-X's results. Subsequent analysis showed that ore samples had been salted with river gold from other parts of the world, as well as with bits of shaved off jewelry. The shares collapsed to nothing. The Felderhof trial has faced years of delays, including a failed attempt by the OSC to get the judge thrown off the case. Other key players in the scandal are dead. Geologist Mike de Guzman died mysteriously after tumbling from a helicopter into the Indonesia jungle, and chief executive and founder, David Walsh, died in the Bahamas of a brain aneurysm after the fraud was exposed. Bizarrely, newspaper reports surfaced in 2005 that de Guzman was alive and hiding out in Brazil. ONLY BRE-X PROSECUTION Felderhof's prosecution is the only one brought in the Bre-X affair, and the failure of the OSC to get a conviction will undoubtedly be held up as another example of ineffectual Canadian market enforcement. OSC lawyer Emily Cole said the regulator has 30 days to decide whether to appeal the verdict. "We'll have to take a look at the rest of the decision and find out how it is that he reached that conclusion before well issue a comment," she said. Investors have had little luck getting any of their money back. One class-action lawsuit launched in Texas fell apart in 2005, while two civil cases are slowly proceeding in Canada. In the meantime, remaining money in the company has been sucked up by lawyer's fees. (Additional reporting by Shallima Maharaj)
