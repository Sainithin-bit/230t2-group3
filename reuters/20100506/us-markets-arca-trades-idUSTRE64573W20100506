 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The New York Stock Exchange said on Thursday it would cancel all trades on its all-electronic trading platform NYSE Arca that were executed between 14:40 and 15:00 ET and that were more than 60 pct away from their last print at 14:40. 

 The move follows a similar decision by the Nasdaq after major U.S. indexes plunged 9.0 percent in afternoon trade before recovering to finish over 3.0 percent down. Traders suspect a trading glitch exacerbated the fall. (Reporting by  Edward Krudy )
