 (Reuters) - Costco Wholesale Corp ( COST.O ) on Thursday reported a 11 percent rise in April sales at stores open at least a year, but the results narrowly missed Wall Street expectations. 

 Analysts on average were expecting the largest U.S. warehouse club operator's same-store sales to rise 11.2 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. Same-store sales at U.S. locations increased 6 percent, while international sales rose 29 percent. Excluding the impact of gasoline price increase and strong foreign currencies, comparable sales for April rose 4 percent. Issaquah, Washington-based Costco said net sales for the four weeks ended May 2 rose 13 percent to $5.83 billion. Shares of the company closed at $60.36 Wednesday on Nasdaq.
