 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A trading error at a major firm was to blame for the day's market plunge, CNBC reported on Thursday. 

 Separately, Nasdaq said it was working with other major markets to review the market activity that occurred between 2:00 p.m. and 3:00 p.m. The exchange said in an e-mail it would advise when more information was known. (Reporting by Wall Street team)
