 PARIS  (Reuters) - Dubai's Emirates airline will soon order 50 Airbus ( EAD.PA ) A350 XWB planes instead of Boeing ( BA.N ) 787 jetliners, the La Tribune newspaper said on Friday in an email. 

 The paper said Emirates would also order other types of planes and in total the deal would be for some one hundred aircraft. It added Emirates could also order more of the A380 of which it has already 55 planes on order. La Tribune added the order would be unveiled at the Dubai air show that starts on Sunday. Airbus was not immediately available for comment. (Reporting by  Marcel Michelson , Editing by David Cowell)
