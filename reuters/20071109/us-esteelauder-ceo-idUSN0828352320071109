 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Estee Lauder Cos Inc ( EL.N ) on Friday named Procter & Gamble Co ( PG.N ) veteran Fabrizio Freda as president and chief operating officer and said he could succeed William Lauder as CEO of the beauty company within two years. 

 Estee, whose shares rose 9 percent following the news, said Freda would join the company on March 3 and would oversee the Estee brands, such as Clinique, Bobbi Brown and the Aramis and Designer Fragrances division. "I also anticipate that Fabrizio will succeed me as CEO within 24 months, once he has had an opportunity to get to know our wonderful company," William Lauder said in a letter addressed to colleagues. Bear Stearns analyst Justin Hott raised his rating on Estee shares to "outperform" said the appointment of Freda would be "well received." "We think investors will perceive his hiring as a positive because Estee has had many operational difficulties under family-run management over the past few years," Hott wrote in a note to clients. "Hiring an outsider will be perceived as an admission that Estee will focus more on operational improvements than family legacies." Until recently, Freda headed P&G's global snacks division. He is currently on special assignment with the consumer goods giant in Switzerland until January 31, a P&G spokesman said. He has not worked in the United States before, the spokesman said. Morgan Stanley analyst William Pecoriello said Freda's unfamiliarity with the U.S. market could be an "obvious risk." Despite that factor, "the appointment of an outsider with mass consumer goods experience implies significant and necessary change is likely," Pecoriello said in a note. New York-based Estee, scheduled to hold its annual shareholder meeting on Friday, also named current Chief Operating Officer Dan Brestle as vice chairman and president of the company's North America operations.
