 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Mortgage finance company Fannie Mae 
FNM.N expects to see its home loan loss rate double in 2008 
compared to this year, the company's chief executive said on 
Friday. 

  "We previously said that our credit loss ratio would be in 
the range of 4 to 6 basis points this year. That is still what 
we expect. Going forward, projecting a 4 percent national 
decline in home prices and a scenario where there is not a 
nationwide recession, we can see our credit loss ratio move 
into the range of 8 to 10 basis points next year," Daniel Mudd, 
the chief executive officer said in a conference call to 
investors.  (Reporting by Patrick Rucker)
