 BANGALORE  (Reuters) - Southern Union Co SUG.N posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings, helped by a decline in costs, but the natural gas company reiterated its 2007 earnings outlook, which was below analysts' expectations. 

 Southern Union said it will form a wholly owned master limited partnership with a part of its gathering and processing assets, which it plans to take public in early 2008. Shares of the company were down more than 3 percent at $31.81 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange. "Some investors may have anticipated that they would form a joint venture. That would have led to the more immediate creation of shareholder value or at least a perception of it," Calyon Securities analyst Gordon Howald said by phone. In a statement, the company said it had considered offers to partner with an existing master limited partnership, but decided that creating and controlling its own MLP would enhance shareholder value over the long term. In a note to clients, Citigroup analyst Faisel Khan said, "SUG will pursue the MLP on a stand-alone basis, which we view as a positive as it negates uncertainty with respect to possible ownership and control interests." QUARTERLY RESULTS For the third quarter, the company reported net income available for common stockholders of $40.9 million, or 34 cents a share, compared with a net loss available for common stockholders of $167.0 million, or $1.42 a share, a year ago. Revenue fell 7 percent to $525.5 million. Earnings from continuing operations for the quarter were 34 cents a share versus 6 cents a share a year ago. Analysts expected Southern Union to earn 32 cents a share on revenue of $538.0 million, according to Reuters Estimates. Cost of gas and other energy resources fell to $261.3 million during the latest third quarter, from $338.7 million in the year-ago period. "The numbers were very strong right across the board," Howald, who has a "buy" rating on the stock, said. Referring to the stock's Friday decline, he said the weakness created a buying opportunity. The company reiterated its earnings outlook of $1.60 to $1.70 a share for 2007. Analysts were expecting $1.79 a share. (Editing by  Pratish Narayanan , Deepak Kannan)
