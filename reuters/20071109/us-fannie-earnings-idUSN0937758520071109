 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Fannie Mae FNM.N, the largest U.S. mortgage finance company, said on Friday its third-quarter net loss doubled from last year as slumping home prices and a credit squeeze drove down values of mortgage securities. 

 Fannie Mae shares initially tumbled more than 7 percent after it reported the loss and forecast that the housing slump will worsen in 2008. By market close, however, most of the losses were erased and the stock closed down 1.6 percent at $49 a share. Fannie Mae said its third-quarter loss widened to $1.52 billion, including preferred stock dividends, from $760 million. The per share loss widened to $1.56 from 79 cents. "This is a tough year for our industry, and Fannie Mae is not immune to the challenges facing the mortgage markets. Our results reflect that," Daniel Mudd, the chief executive officer, said in a statement. For the first nine months of the year, Fannie Mae's net income plummeted to $1.5 billion from $3.0 billion in the same period in 2006, the company said. Its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission brought its financial reporting up to date for the first time since an accounting scandal hit in 2004. Fannie's quarterly income can swing widely as interest rates fluctuate and affect home buyers' tendencies to refinance mortgages, but the spike in failing loans also hurt the company. While shares of both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac FRE.N, the second-largest U.S. mortgage finance company, recovered from their Friday lows, both companies had a bruising week with more news of an ailing housing sector, credit worries and fresh government scrutiny. In recent weeks, investors have fretted that financial firms like Fannie and Freddie may be dangerously exposed to failing home loans, particularly subprime mortgages to borrowers with damaged credit. In a statement, Fannie said it had increased its provision for credit losses by $1.6 billion to $2 billion for the first three quarters of 2007 and it expects to see its home loan loss rate double in 2008. "We previously said that our credit loss ratio would be in the range of 4 to 6 basis points this year. That is still what we expect." Mudd said in a conference call with investors Friday afternoon. "Going forward ... we can see our credit loss ratio move into the range of 8 to 10 basis points next year." Mudd said the outlook assumed a 4 percent decline in national home prices and the United States avoiding an economic recession. While Fannie is taking a hit on failing loans, Mudd said the company has not invested heavily in risky mortgages and so would dodge the worst of the ongoing downturn. "In 2007 we're seeing the value of some of the tough choices we made in recent years to hold on to our credit discipline. Those choices have shielded us from the worst effects of the housing and mortgage market correction," he said in a statement. Fannie said it expects to see a further decline in new mortgage loans in 2008 but that it has raised fees on its service of guaranteeing home loans in order to brace for any shocks. Earlier this week, New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo said he had served subpoenas on Fannie and Freddie as part of an investigation into inflated home appraisals. The companies have said they are cooperating with the investigation but that they have strong safeguards against home value inflation. In December, Fannie finished a $6.3 billion restatement of past earnings begun after accounting irregularities came to light in late 2004. Since that time, the company has filed its financial reports late. (Reporting by Patrick Rucker)
