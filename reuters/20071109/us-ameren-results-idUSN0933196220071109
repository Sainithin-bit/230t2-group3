 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Power company Ameren Corp ( AEE.N ) said on Friday its third-quarter earnings fell 17 percent, pushed down by higher operating costs and a rate relief settlement in Illinois. 

 Net income was $244 million, or $1.18 per share, compared with $293 million, or $1.42 per share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, earnings were $1.36 per share, down from $1.52 in the year-ago period. Revenue rose 5 percent to $2 billion, the St. Louis-based company said. Ameren stood by its forecast for full-year earnings, before special items, of $3.15 to $3.40 per share. Analysts' average forecast is $3.40, according to Reuters Estimates. Ameren expects 2007 net earnings of $2.80 to $3.05 per share. (Reporting by  Lisa Lee , editing by Gerald E. McCormick and John Wallace)
