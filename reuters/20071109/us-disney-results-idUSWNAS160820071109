 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co ( DIS.N ), the second-largest U.S. entertainment company, reported on Thursday a 12 percent rise in quarterly profit, driven by sports network ESPN and U.S. theme parks, but revenue just missed Wall Street's target. 

 Chief Executive Bob Iger said he had not seen any signs that economic weakness was weighing on advertising or travel, but a Hollywood writers strike that began this week could cut into network profits if it lasted more than four weeks. ESPN drove the networks' growth with a rise in advertising and affiliate revenue from higher rates and more subscribers, as well as more previously deferred revenue than last year. Broadcast television posted a $30 million operating loss due to fewer TV shows selling into syndication and the shutdown of the mobile phone service, which was overseen the division. Disney's domestic theme parks benefited from growth in visitor spending and attendance, as the weak dollar kept U.S. travelers from going abroad. Deteriorating attendance at Hong Kong Disneyland weighed on results, and the park had to renegotiate its debt terms. Disney shares ticked down a few cents in after-hours trade. Net income rose to $877 million, or 44 cents per share, from $782 million, or 36 cents per share, in last year's fiscal fourth quarter. Revenue rose 3 percent to $8.9 billion. Excluding a 2-cent-per-share tax-related benefit, Disney earnings were 42 cents per share, in line with Wall Street's average target. Analysts, on average, had forecast revenue of $9.02 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Goldman Sachs analyst Anthony Noto said Disney, which now has posted double-digit operating growth for six quarters, should see "another year of solid growth" despite a softer consumer environment. "We believe the shares have the potential to appreciate even in a decelerating economic environment ... with drivers of growth coming from content-driven success," Noto said in a note to clients. ABC AD SALES STRONG Media networks revenue rose 14 percent to $4.0 billion, and operating income at the segment rose 25 percent to $1.1 billion. Parks revenue rose 10 percent to $2.8 billion, while the unit's income rose 9 percent to $430 million. Disney's domestic resorts saw an uptick of mid-single-digit percentages in room reservations and attendance, and spot ad sales at its ABC network were running "strong" double-digit percentages ahead of its upfront sales. The network, with the top-rated prime-time schedule, may be forced to cut costs and slot in more reality shows, news and reruns if the writers' strike lasts more than a month, Iger said. Disney's movie studio won't be affected by it until 2009, he added. The studio posted a 24 percent decline in revenue to $1.5 billion in the quarter, and a 21 percent drop to $214 million in operating income, compared with a year ago when "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest" was playing in theaters. Consumer products revenue rose 5 percent to $590 million and its operating profit climbed 10 percent to $139 million on the success of "High School Musical" and "Cars" merchandise. Disney said it plans to boost capital expenditures by $250 million to $300 million in fiscal 2008, with the new money going to digital improvements at its studio and networks, and to improvements at its theme parks, particularly California Adventure in Anaheim. Creditors of the Hong Kong Disneyland joint venture agreed to suspend the debt covenants of a $293 million commercial loan for a year and give partners access to a credit revolver that had been frozen, Chief Financial Officer Tom Staggs said. In exchange, the joint venture will repay the principal by September 30, 2008, and Disney will forgo royalties from the park for "a couple of years," Staggs said on a conference call. Like rivals Time Warner Inc ( TWX.N ) and Viacom Inc VIAb.N, Disney is benefiting this year from a string of box office blockbusters and strong cable advertising rates. Disney's share price rose less than 1 percent in its fourth quarter ended September 29. The stock was trading at a multiple of 15.7 times estimated 2008 earnings, compared with 15.7 for Time Warner and 15.6 for Viacom, according to Reuters Estimates. The stock fell to $33.55 in after-hours trade from a close of $33.63 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Editing by  Braden Reddall )
