 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Richard Syron, the chairman and chief executive officer at Freddie Mac FRE.N, will stay with the company through 2009, the mortgage finance giant said on Friday. 

 In a statement, the company said Syron will become executive chairman of the board once the company finds a new CEO, which it expects to do by mid-2008. In May, Eugene McQuade, Freddie's president and presumed successor to Syron, stepped down, leaving a question mark about who would next lead the company.
