 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - With stock in American International Group Inc ( AIG.N ) hitting lows not seen for more than two years, investors and analysts are wondering if former Chief Executive Maurice "Hank" Greenberg has a real plan for the world's largest insurer. 

 AIG reported late on Wednesday that third-quarter operating profit fell by 13 percent, missing analysts' estimates by 27 cents a share. It warned in a conference call on Thursday that revenue in some parts of the company, such as the mortgage insurance unit, probably would not improve in 2008. Analysts lowered their price targets for the company, and its shares fell $2.80 a share, or 4.8 percent, to $55.20, a low since August 2005 when the company was in the midst of a scandal. "Investors may be voting for Greenberg," said Donald Light, an analyst with Celent LLC. Greenberg last Friday said in a federal filing that he was interested in exploring "strategic alternatives" for AIG with other investors. He provided no specifics, however. Greenberg is contemplating a proxy fight that would replace AIG's board and allow him to retake control of AIG, according to Forbes.com. While Greenberg does not want to be chief executive again himself, he does want to fire AIG's current management, according to the report. The 82-year-old Greenberg is AIG's largest single shareholder, owning more than 12 percent of AIG's stock through companies that he controls. AIG shares rose early in the week after his filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Greenberg still faces civil fraud charges from his more than 30 years as chief executive of AIG that were brought by then-New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, who is now the state's governor. Greenberg was ousted by AIG's board early in 2005, and AIG paid $1.6 billion the following year to settle with regulators. Sources also say that he declined to answer questions on whether he entered into transactions that manipulated earnings at AIG at an SEC hearing in September of this year. Greenberg, through a spokesman, declined to comment. "I always felt that Greenberg got railroaded, and the threats of indictment never happened," said James Ellman of Seacliff Capital, which has $200 million under management. "But he'll have to get other shareholders such as Fidelity to back him." Alan Kral of Trevor Stewart Burton Jacobsen Inc, with $800 million under management, said he sold his holdings in AIG during the first quarter. He cited the "legal turmoil" surrounding Greenberg, who has filed lawsuits against AIG and faces countersuits from the New York insurer. Analysts say Greenberg probably wants to force the company to sell off pieces of itself that are now unprofitable. "The Greenberg saga has been a soap opera so far," said Matt Nellans, an analyst with Morningstar. "But given how much of AIG he owns, it's not in his interest to hurt the company." Whether Greenberg gets AIG to move in his direction or not, AIG still has to deal with continued losses in its mortgage insurance unit, its $500 billion exposure to a portfolio of credit default swaps and losses on loans made to borrowers who bought homes through its consumer finance unit. Credit Suisse cut its price target on AIG on Thursday to $74 a share from $79, while Lehman Brothers cut its target to $71 a share from $80. "We estimate AIG could suffer a negative mark-to-market of $3 billion to $4 billion due to subprime exposure," said Lehman analyst Jay Gelb in a research note.
