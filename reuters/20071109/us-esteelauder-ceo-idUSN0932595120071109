 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Estee Lauder Cos Inc ( EL.N ) on Friday named Procter & Gamble Co ( PG.N ) veteran Fabrizio Freda as president and chief operating officer, and said he could succeed William Lauder as CEO of the beauty company within two years. 

 Estee, whose shares were up more than 8 percent, said Freda would join the company on March 3 and oversee its international business, as well as such brands as Clinique, Bobbi Brown and the Aramis and Designer Fragrances division. "I also anticipate that Fabrizio will succeed me as CEO within 24 months," Lauder said in a letter addressed to colleagues, "once he has had an opportunity to get to know our wonderful company." Lauder has been the company's CEO since July 2004, and also serves on its board. The move to bring in an outsider to possibly spearhead the company comes as Estee grapples with limp U.S. sales, delicate consumer spending, department store consolidation and higher operating costs. Freda's potential appointment would be "well received" by investors, said Bear Stearns analyst Justin Hott, raising his rating on Estee's shares to "outperform." "We think investors will perceive his hiring as a positive because Estee has had many operational difficulties under family-run management over the past few years," Hott wrote in a note to clients. "Hiring an outsider will be perceived as an admission that Estee will focus more on operational improvements than family legacies." At its shareholder meeting in New York, chairman Leonard Lauder said he planned to step down in two years and take on the role of chairman emeritus. Lauder also said he hoped his son William would replace him as chairman. Encouraged by the news, Estee investors drove its shares up $3.45 to $44.52 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. APPEALING New York-based Estee has forecast strong growth in its international business and plans to launch new products soon. Given the company's increased focus on driving growth overseas, "the notion of having a nonfamily member ... especially a non-American" as CEO is appealing, Goldman Sachs analyst Amy Low Chasen wrote in a note to clients. Freda, 50, until recently headed P&G's global snacks division. He is on special assignment with the consumer goods giant in Switzerland until January 31, and has not worked in the United States before, a P&G spokesman said. The fact that Freda was not completely familiar with the U.S. market could be an "obvious risk," Morgan Stanley analyst William Pecoriello said in a note. Despite that factor, "the appointment of an outsider with mass consumer goods experience implies significant and necessary change is likely," Pecoriello wrote. Freda's background with P&G could fuel the belief that the consumer titan could someday acquire the beauty company, Hott said. However, when asked if that could be the case, an Estee spokeswoman said the company is still focused on remaining independent, while the spokesman for P&G said it had no comment. Estee also named Chief Operating Officer Dan Brestle as vice chairman and president of the company's North America operations. (Reporting by Aarthi Sivaraman; Editing by  Brian Moss )
