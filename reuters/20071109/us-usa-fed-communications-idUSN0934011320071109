 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke will discuss the central bank's communications policies in a speech next week, the Fed said on Friday, in all likelihood bringing to conclusion a long-running review. 

 Fed sources said last month the bank was close to agreeing to changes in its communications strategy that would include extending the horizon of published forecasts to three years from two. Bernanke is due to speak at 9:10 a.m. on Wednesday at the Cato Institute, a Washington-based public policy research group. The changes, which may also include increasing the frequency of publicly released forecasts to four times a year from the current two, are aimed at giving markets a clearer sense of how the Fed would react to economic developments. The Fed is not expected to adopt explicit numerical targets for inflation, a step Bernanke has advocated, any time soon, the sources said. Many other central banks around the world have inflation targets, which many policy-makers believe help them anchor the public's expectations of future inflation. The Fed is parrying criticism in financial markets that it is underestimating the need to reduce benchmark interest rates to stabilize an economy hit hard by a housing downturn and financial market turbulence. Providing more information about the Fed's longer-term outlook might give markets a clearer sense of how it views the path of the economy and interest rates, said Vincent Reinhart, a former top adviser to the Fed's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee. "The committee doesn't think it has to ease any more -- if that's the case, then it must have a different forecast than the market. Here's a chance to be more specific about that forecast," said Reinhart, who is now with the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. Bernanke has made improved communications a signature project of his leadership. "A more transparent policy process increases democratic accountability, promotes constructive dialogue between policy-makers and informed outsiders, reduces uncertainty in financial markets, and helps to anchor the public's expectations of long-run inflation," he told a Senate panel considering his nomination to lead the Fed in November 2005. The Fed launched a formal review of communications strategy in spring 2006 when Bernanke appointed Fed Vice Chairman Donald Kohn, a targeting skeptic, to lead a subcommittee to frame discussions. Those discussions have covered a range of issues, including the desirability of adopting a numeric inflation goal, and a Fed source said communications was on the agenda of the FOMC's last policy meeting on October 30-31. Bernanke's cherished objective of explicit inflation targets appears on hold, however, in the face of the objections of a key congressman, U.S. House of Representatives' Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank. Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat, said setting an inflation target would unacceptably nudge the Fed toward giving inflation-fighting priority over ensuring full employment. The Fed's congressional mandate calls on it to pursue both price stability and full employment. "It's a compromise solution that reflects the political reality," Reinhart said of the steps the Fed is expected to unveil. "Chairman Bernanke moves in the direction of being more explicit ... Chairman Frank gets a victory because the FOMC doesn't go all the way to having an inflation goal," he said. (Reporting by Mark Felsenthal; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
