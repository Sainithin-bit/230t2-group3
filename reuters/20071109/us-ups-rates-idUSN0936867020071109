 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Package delivery company United Parcel Service Inc ( UPS.N ) said on Friday it was raising its prices for 2008 by about 4.9 percent, matching a planned hike by rival FedEx Corp ( FDX.N ). 

 UPS said the new rates will take effect December 31. Ground rates will rise by about 4.9 percent, and rates on air express shipments and international deliveries starting in the United States will rise by 6.9 percent, but fuel surcharges on these services will decline by 2 percent. In October, FedEx said it would raise its 2008 delivery rates by 4.9 percent, a hike that analysts said was its largest increase since 2008. Both UPS and FedEx are seen as bellwethers of the U.S. economy, based on the premise than in a faster-growing economy, more packages are shipped. Shares of Atlanta-based UPS were down 55 cents to $71.51 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange. FedEx shares were off 85 cents to $101.59. So far this year, UPS shares are down 5 percent, while FedEx shares are off 7 percent. By way of comparison, the Dow Jones transport average index .DJT, which includes railroads, airlines and trucking companies, is up 2 percent. (Reporting by  Scott Malone ; editing by John Wallace)
