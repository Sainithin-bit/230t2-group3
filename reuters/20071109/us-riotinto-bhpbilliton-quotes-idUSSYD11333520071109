 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - BHP Billiton ( BHP.AX ) ( BLT.L ) has made a long-awaited takeover approach to Rio Tinto ( RIO.AX ) ( RIO.L ) in a move that would create a mining giant worth over $350 billion. 

 Rio has rejected the all-share proposal as too low. Following are some comments from analysts, fund managers and others. MARK PERVAN, SENIOR COMMODITIES ANALYST, ANZ BANK "If I were a Chinese steelmaker I'd be willing to pay more for iron ore for next year to send Rio's shares soaring and create a headache for BHP that could delay a takeover, but I am not sure if they think that way." GREG GOODSELL, EQUITY STRATEGIST, ABN AMRO "This is probably just the first move in the chess game. The interesting issue is what other combinations and transactions will emerge out of this." EDWARD MEIR, ANALYST, MF GLOBAL (New York) "Theoretically, a merger would mean more discipline on the supply side, but base metals are preoccupied with the here and now -- influenced by inventories and equities, capped off with Bernanke's comments that we are facing an economic slowdown." JOHN COLNAN, ANALYST, SHAW STOCKBROKING "If you put together a consortium of Chinese, they could be out there, as well the Russians, given there is a lot of oil money being generated ... Rio's shareholders may be happy to take BHP stock, but anyone else would need to come up with cash." DENIS DONOHUE, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, SUNCORP METWAY INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT (owns BHP and Rio shares) "The scarcity and the difficulty of bringing on new projects, sourcing people, makes these sorts of consolidations attractive. The Chinese would be the most impacted by it. You'd think they wouldn't be happy about it. They're their biggest customer." TIM BARKER, FUND MANAGER, BT FINANCIAL GROUP. "The Chinese won't like it. The Japanese probably won't like it. But I'm not sure what they can do about it without either of them having a go at the company themselves. "CVRD is probably the only one that would be of a size that you'd think of as potentially likely. Xstrata could probably do it, if there's innovative financing." CRAIG MCGOWAN, INDEPENDENT ANALYST (in comments to Australian Broadcasting Corp) "There'll be some significant international interest from the Europeans, the North Americans and I think that you'll see this is really just an opening round. You can rest assured that it hasn't only been BHP that's been looking at Rio." PETER STEPHENS, DIRECTOR, STANDARD & POOR'S "Size and integration of the two businesses will be a challenge and something we'd be concerned about. If a transaction was to progress it would take some time to bed down because of its complexity, because of its size. "I would expect that should a transaction like this occur, (BHP) would be using its capital to develop the businesses rather than returning it to shareholders." ROB CRAIGIE, ANALYST, FW HOLST "Certainly what the market would be expecting is perhaps a prospective transaction value which could be above where the shares are today. "BHP can extract more synergies from a takeover of Rio Tinto compared to anyone else and therefore should be able to pay more than others. "One possibility would be Chinese sovereign funds taking a blocking stake in Rio Tinto." MINING ANALYST, NORTH AMERICAN BANK (Sydney) "It's early days and both companies need to go through process first before we get a clearer picture. But it is safe to say there are some serious competition hurdles to cross. We've got a target of A$108 a share on Rio, but we'll be updating that within 24 hours." (Reporting by Sydney newsroom)
