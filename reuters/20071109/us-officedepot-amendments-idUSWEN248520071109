 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Office Depot Inc ( ODP.N ) said on Thursday it will reduce earnings for some prior periods following an independent review of its accounting for certain vendor program funds. 

 The company estimates it will reduce diluted earnings per share by 2 cents in the 2006 third quarter and by 3 cents in the 2006 fourth quarter. For this year, it will reduce the first quarter earnings by 1 cent per share and by 2 cents per share for the second quarter. The diluted impact of approximately 7 cents per share will be recognized beginning in the second half of 2007 and in decreasing amounts in years from 2008 through 2010, Office Depot said. The errors, discovered by an audit committee following a whistleblower complaint, are non-cash adjustments to previously reported results. The company intends to file an amended Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for fiscal 2006 and amended Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q/A for the first and second quarters of 2007.
