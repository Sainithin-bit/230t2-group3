 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wachovia Corp WB.N, the fourth-largest U.S. bank, on Friday said it incurred about $1.1 billion of losses in October on mortgage securities as a year-long credit market slump shows no signs of abating. 

 The company said the pretax value of collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) invested in asset-backed securities declined by $1.1 billion last month. That's on top of a $1.3 billion write-down during the third quarter. Wachovia also warned that it expects to set aside $500 million to $600 million in excess of actual mortgage-loan charge-offs, further reducing earnings. Shares of Wachovia fell 5 percent in pre-market trade. Many large U.S. banks have been battered by mounting consumer-loan losses and sinking investor demand for mortgages and other debt as the housing market slumps. On Wednesday, Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) said it had suffered $3.7 billion of subprime mortgage losses that would result in a $2.5 billion hit to fourth-quarter results. Two weeks ago Merrill Lynch MER.N reported $8.4 billion in third-quarter losses on investments tied to subprime mortgages, prompting the departure of Chief Executive Stan O'Neal. Citigroup ( C.N ) wrote off $6.4 billion in assets hit by credit market turmoil and later, as CEO Chuck Prince resigned, warned it could suffer up to $11 billion in further losses. Charlotte, North Carolina-based Wachovia painted a grim picture of a mortgage market that continues to deteriorate. Last month defaults and delinquent payments by home owners with poor credit climbed, while rating agencies downgraded a number of subprime-linked securities. These developments fueled sharp declines in closely watched "ABX" subprime indexes, which in turn put further pressure on the value of mortgage-backed securities and CDOs. Wachovia ranked third for the first nine months of this year in CDO underwriting at $19.6 billion, though most of that involved commercial mortgage securities. Many of the biggest write-downs have come from leading CDO issuers that found themselves stuck with securities that attracted no buyers. Total residential MBS exposure was unchanged during the month at $2.1 billion. Wachovia said the losses incurred on these other positions were immaterial after hedges. The value of the assets may decline further depending on market conditions, Wachovia said. (Reporting by Joseph A.
