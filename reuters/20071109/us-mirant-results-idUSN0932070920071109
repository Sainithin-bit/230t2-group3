 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Mirant Corp MIR.N said on Friday it decided not to sell itself and will instead return $4.6 billion in cash to shareholders. 

 Shares of the independent power producer fell $4.55, or nearly 11 percent, to $37.95, giving it a current market value of roughly $10 billion. Mirant trades on the New York Stock Exchange. The company also reported a quarterly profit, helped by a gain from a power contract settlement. "Some people were not happy that it was not a Dutch auction, which in general would have opened the market for a much larger, broader stock buyback instead of keeping $1 billion in a vague schedule," said Daniele Seitz, analyst at investment bank Dahlman Rose. "That kind of uncertainty was disappointing to the market," Seitz said. "And there was a soft erosion in '07 and '08 guidance," she added. In a Dutch auction, bidding starts with a deliberately high asking price which is lowered until an acceptable price is found, or a predetermined minimum price is reached. In the first stage of the cash return, Mirant said it will buy $1 billion in stock in an accelerated repurchase program together with open market repurchases of an additional $1 billion. In the company's third-quarter earnings call, Chief Executive Edward Muller declined to answer investors' questions as to why a Dutch auction process was not selected. Last April, Atlanta-based Mirant said it would explore its strategic options, including the potential sale of the company. Mirant, which emerged from bankruptcy protection early last year, had been considered a leading takeover target in the power sector following a $32 billion leveraged buyout bid for TXU Corp. But the crisis that began roiling the credit market this summer stalled many private equity deals, including Mirant's possible sale. And potential peer buyers were discouraged by Mirant's high valuation, according to industry experts. "We have completed a very thorough exploration of strategic alternatives and decided that the best thing to do at this time is to return $4.6 billion of cash to our stockholders," Chief Executive Edward Muller told investors in a conference call. Net income was $775 million, or $2.74 per share, in the third quarter, compared with a year-earlier loss of $26 million, or 9 cents per share, when Mirant took impairment losses of $516 million. In the latest quarter, Mirant posted a $379 million gain after settling a contract dispute with Pepco Holdings Inc  ( POM.N ). Excluding special items, earnings from continuing operations were $323 million, or $1.14 per share, up from $131 million, or 44 cents per share, a year earlier. Mirant now sees adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $1 billion in 2007, down from its March forecast of $1.089 billion for this year, and adjusted EBITDA of $907 million in 2008, a dip from its $914 million 2008 outlook of March. Mirant also reinitiated earnings forecasts for 2007 and 2008. "We are planning to return the remainder of the $4.6 billion and to talk about how we will move forward on the remaining $2.6 billion after we have completed this first advance share repurchase," Muller said. Recent assets sales, including the shedding of its Caribbean business to Japan's Marubeni Corp ( 8002.T ), have given Mirant a cash position of about $6 billion. Mirant was in bankruptcy between July 2003 and January 2006. The company owns or lease about 10,300 megawatts of generating capacity, and sells power in the competitive wholesale market.
