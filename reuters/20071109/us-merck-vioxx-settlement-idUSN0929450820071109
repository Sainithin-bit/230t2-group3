 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Merck & Co ( MRK.N ) is expected to announce a deal to pay $4.85 billion to settle a significant portion of claims over injuries allegedly linked to its Vioxx painkiller, the Wall Street Journal said on Friday, citing a person familiar with the matter. 

 An agreement is expected to be announced on Friday morning in New Orleans, where a federal judge is overseeing the case, according to the Journal. "We've been asked by the judge to talk to the plaintiffs," a Merck defense spokesman told the paper. Representatives from Merck could not immediately be reached for comment. The company had previously said it intended to fight each case on a case-by-base basis rather than consider any broad settlement. But industry analysts said investors were likely to welcome closure of the outstanding disputes. "If confirmed, rapid settlement of one third of cases that represent over half of plaintiffs for less than $5 billion likely would be taken positively," said Mike Ward of Nomura Securities in London. He noted that litigation over Wyeth's WYE.N Phen-Fen diet drug was only now coming slowly to a close after 10 years in the courts and over $21 billion in settlement costs. Merck pulled its once $2.5 billion-a-year medicine from the market in September 2004 after a study showed it doubled the risk of heart attack and stroke in patients taking it for more than 18 months. The New Jersey-based drugmaker is facing 10s of thousands of lawsuits filed by former users of Vioxx who claim they were harmed by the drug, and insurance companies and health maintenance organizations seeking reimbursement for their spending on the pill. Since the withdrawal of Vioxx, Merck has won 11 and lost five of the cases going to trial. (Reporting by  Justin Grant  and  Ben Hirschler ; Editing by Greg Mahlich)
