 SHANGHAI  (Reuters) - Chinese resource firms are unlikely to launch a counter-offer for Rio Tinto Ltd/Plc ( RIO.AX ) but may hope to team up with BHP Billiton Ltd/Plc ( BHP.AX ) to clinch the industry's biggest takeover, bankers said on Friday. 

 The Chinese know Australia is unlikely to endorse a foreign takeover of a major natural resource company, bankers said, noting the government blocked Royal Dutch Shell Plc's ( RDSa.L ) attempt to acquire oil and gas producer Woodside ( WPL.AX ). But the possibility of the Chinese partnering BHP ( BLT.L ) to buy Rio ( RIO.L ) should not be ruled out as BHP may need Chinese financial backing to sweeten a $140 billion all-share offer that Rio has rejected, said bankers not involved in the deal. Such a tie-up would give Chinese state companies better access to the copper and iron ore needed to fuel 10 percent annual economic growth, bankers said, adding the Chinese could also pick up assets that BHP and Rio may have to ditch for a takeover to go through. Chinese companies have increased their financial clout as commodity prices and stock markets have soared. "I don't think the Chinese would bid for Rio in competition with BHP. That could raise some real issues not just in Australia but elsewhere. I would think they would partner up with one or another," said one senior banker, who asked not to be identified. "BHP may partner with somebody in order to sweeten the bid," the banker added, citing Aluminum Corp of China Ltd (Chalco) ( 2600.HK ) ( 601600.SS ) ( ACH.N ), the country's largest aluminum producer, and China Investment Corp, a newly created sovereign fund, as possible candidates. Officials at Chalco, whose parent aims to be an "international, multi-metals mining company", were not available for comment. "There has been a huge drive by Chinese producers to secure access to commodities through M&A, said another banker. "There would be a natural conclusion that one or more Chinese companies would look into a deal like this." However, a source with knowledge of BHP's bid strategy for Rio said the partnership idea remains wishful thinking by investment bankers, as it is too early to judge whether BHP would need a partner to complete a takeover. "You've got every bank in the world right now who is not mandated to this transaction already trying to find themselves a client," the source said, declining to elaborate. Global mining leader BHP said it had approached Rio Tinto in a move aimed at creating a $350 billion-plus resources giant, but Rio rejected the offer as too low. Some analysts said on Friday that Rio Tinto could cost more than $170 billion, especially if other parties got involved in a bid war. PRICING CLOUT Bankers and analysts said metals consumers such as China and South Korea would baulk at BHP and Rio combining and having more clout at price negotiations. Chinese steelmakers already face another major price hike in iron ore imports next year. A single BHP/Rio force would be unprecedented in the mining sector -- capable of controlling the global armada of loads of iron ore, copper, coal and other industrial-use staples. China has been scouring the world for natural resources from oil and gas to iron ore. The country's oil majors -- China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC), parent of PetroChina ( 0857.HK )( PTR.N ), CNOOC Ltd ( 0883.HK )( CEO.N ), and Sinopec Group, parent of Sinopec Corp ( 0386.HK )( SNP.N ) -- have made a series of multi-billion dollar acquisitions in recent years. By contrast, its mining firms have been too small to make significant overseas acquisitions. Bankers also noted BHP has the financial muscle to go it alone for Rio and may not need a partner, unless Rio forces a significant increase in its bid. They said it was unlikely a Chinese oil company such as PetroChina would dump recent strategy, and buy into Rio. Many international oil and gas companies diversified into mining in the early 1980s, but sold up about 10 years later. (Editing by  Ian Geoghegan )
