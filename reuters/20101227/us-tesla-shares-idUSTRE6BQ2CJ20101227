 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Shares of Tesla Motors ( TSLA.O ) fell more than 10 percent on Monday, the day the electric carmaker's "lock-up period" expired, flooding the stock market with shares. 

 The lock-up is a 180-day period in which sales of some of Tesla's shares after its initial public offering were restricted. Beginning Monday, the owners of 75 million shares can sell their stock, according to a filing with U.S. regulators. This can depress the company's share price, Tesla said in a filing with regulators last month. When Tesla debuted on the Nasdaq in late June, its shares rose more than 40 percent. The company is readying its Model S, a luxury electric sedan which it plans to launch in 2012. But last week, Capstone Investments analyst Carter Driscoll initiated Tesla at a "sell" with a $22 target, saying the market for electric vehicles will not grow as quickly as expected. Driscoll said he did not believe Tesla would be able to reach its projected earnings before interest and taxes target of 14 percent to 16 percent. Tesla stock fell 11.5 percent at $26.64 on the Nasdaq. (Reporting by Deepa Seetharaman. Editing by Robert MacMillan)
