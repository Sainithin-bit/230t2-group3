 MOSCOW  (Reuters) - Russia's competition watchdog sees no major issues with PepsiCo's ( PEP.N ) plan to buy juice and dairy company Wimm-Bill-Dann ( WBDF.MM ) WBD.N, Interfax news agency reported on Monday. 

 "We are thinking well (of the deal), there are no big issues," Igor Artemyev, head of the Federal Anti-monopoly Service, was quoted as saying. Earlier this month, U.S. giant PepsiCo said it would buy control of WBD ( WBDF.MM ) for $3.8 billion -- one of the biggest acquisitions by a foreign company in Russia -- as it looks to emerging markets for growth. Artemyev said PepsiCo's share of the Russian juice market will not exceed 45 percent following the transaction, and it will also control 30 percent of the country's dairy market.
