 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Charles Schwab, the chairman and founder of Charles Schwab Corp ( SCHW.N ), has undergone successful heart valve replacement surgery, the largest U.S. discount brokerage said on Monday. 

 Schwab, 73, is resting comfortably and recuperating well from Friday's surgery and expects to return home in the next few days, Chief Executive Walter Bettinger said in a statement. A spokesman for the company did not immediately return a call seeking additional comment. According to Schwab's website, Charles Schwab started the San Francisco-based company in 1971 and entered the discount brokerage business in 1974. The company said it ended September with $1.47 trillion of client assets and 7.92 million active brokerage accounts, and has more than 300 offices. Shares of Schwab closed Thursday at $17.02 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel. Editing by Robert MacMillan)
