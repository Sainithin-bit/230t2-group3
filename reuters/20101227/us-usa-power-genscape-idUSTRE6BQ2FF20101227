 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - U.S. power output for the week ended December 23 fell 0.9 percent but was 6 percent greater than the same week last year, Genscape said Monday. 

 Temperatures were generally at or above normal during the week before Christmas, with stormy weather largely confined to the West. A stronger economy is feeding year-over-year increases in power use. Genscape, a power industry data provider, uses sources including publicly available data and electricity demand measured at more than 280 power plants. (Reporting by  Bruce Nichols )
