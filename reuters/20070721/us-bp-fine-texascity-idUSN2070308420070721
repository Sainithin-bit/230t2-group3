 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration on Friday proposed to fine BP Plc ( BP.L ) $92,000 for safety violations at a Texas City refinery where 15 workers died in a 2005 explosion and fire. 

 The citations, including one for a violation that OSHA said could have led to "another catastrophic accident," arose from OSHA's monitoring of the plant in the wake of the March 2005 blast that also injured 170 workers. BP has 15 working days to contest the citations and penalties, and a spokesman said the company was studying the allegations before deciding how to proceed. Some problems cited already were being addressed, the spokesman said. The company was cited for alleged "willful" failure to ensure that a pressure relief system on the plant's fractionator vessel conforms to industry codes, an OSHA news release said. "The hazard cited is that the inadequate pressure relief equipment could fail, leading to another catastrophic accident," the release read. BP spokesman Ronnie Chappell said the company, which has pledged to improve safety, already had identified fractionator pressure relief problems and in 2004 instituted process controls and installed instruments to minimize the risk. "We have a permanent fix on the way," Chappell said. "In October 2006, we ordered a new fractionator tower with a modified pressure relief system. It's due to be installed in 2008." BP also was cited for alleged "serious" violations, some of which were related to the fractionator problem, including failure to correct fractionator hazards and failure to install correct pressure relief valves. Two other serious-level citations were for failure to ensure the accuracy of diagrams of piping and instruments and failure to ensure the use of non-sparking electrical equipment where flammable liquids and gases are processed. The citations were the latest development in a long-running regulatory process arising from the accident. BP also has faced lawsuits from workers and their families and paid millions in settlements. The refinery, with crude-processing capacity rated at 460,000 barrels a day, was further hampered by rapid shutdown when Hurricane Rita threatened Houston in late 2005. It is operating at about half its capacity.
