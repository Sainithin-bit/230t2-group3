 PARIS  (Reuters) - Franco-Dutch carrier Air France-KLM ( AIRF.PA ) said it is not involved in the negotiations between Virgin Atlantic VA.UL and Delta Air Lines ( DAL.N ) about a transatlantic joint venture. 
 Delta and Virgin plan to set up a revenue-sharing deal on flights between Britain and the United States if the U.S. airline buys Singapore Airlines' ( SIAL.SI ) 49 percent stake in the UK carrier, a source close to Virgin said. "Air France-KLM is not involved in current negotiations between Delta and Singapore," a spokeswoman for Air France-KLM said on Monday. (Reporting by Cyril Altmeyer; Editing by  Christian Plumb )
