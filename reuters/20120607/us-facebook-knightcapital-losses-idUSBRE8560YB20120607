 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Losses by banks and brokerages due to Facebook Inc's botched market debut on Nasdaq OMX Group's exchange nearly a month ago may be as high as $200 million, Thomas Joyce, chief executive officer of Knight Capital Group Inc, said on Thursday. 
 Nasdaq said on Wednesday that it would offer $40 million in cash and rebates to clients harmed by its mishandling of Facebook's market debut. "It's underwhelming at best," Joyce said of the plan during a conference in New York. "Nasdaq has got to go back to the drawing board and come up with something else." Knight, which was a market maker in the Facebook initial public offering, said it alone lost up to $35 million due to Nasdaq's glitches. (Reporting By  John McCrank ; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
