 MADRID  (Reuters) - Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said on Thursday he would wait to see the results of independent audits of the country's banking system before talking with Europe over the best course of action to recapitalize the banking system. 
 Earlier sources told Reuters that an International Monetary Fund report to be released next Monday would show troubled lenders need at least 40 billion euros ($50.2 billion) in aid. (Reporting by Nigel Davies; Editing by  Fiona Ortiz )
