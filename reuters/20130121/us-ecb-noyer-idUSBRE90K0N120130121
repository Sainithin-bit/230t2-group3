 PARIS  (Reuters) - The euro zone has marked a turning point in its debt crisis, with member states showing a determination to cut deficits and carry out structural reforms, European Central Bank governing council member Christian Noyer said on Monday. 
 "Today, I think we can say that nobody doubts anymore that the euro will last," Noyer said in a New Year speech to journalists. (Reporting by Jean-Baptiste Vey; Writing by  Vicky Buffery ; Editing by  Catherine Bremer )
