 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's transport ministry said on Monday it will continue its investigation into problems with batteries used in Boeing Co's 787 Dreamliner jet and manufactured by Japanese battery maker GS Yuasa Corp. 
 A ministry official said there was no timetable for how long the investigation will last. Japan's Civil Aviation Bureau will send an official to the Kyoto-based battery maker on Tuesday after U.S. and Japanese aviation safety officials visited a factory there on Monday.
