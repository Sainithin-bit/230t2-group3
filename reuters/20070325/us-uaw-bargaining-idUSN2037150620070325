 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Unionized auto workers gather in Detroit this week to prepare for contract talks seen as crucial to the survival of what remains of the "Big Three" and the middle-class expectations of their blue-collar workers. 

 The United Auto Workers union faces pressure to offer givebacks on health-care benefits estimated to add $1,000 to the cost of an American-made car, one of the issues expected to top the agenda for the union's two-day convention. And as some 1,500 UAW representatives from locals around the United States gather on Tuesday and Wednesday to consider the embattled union's negotiating priorities, they also face a new wild-card: the possible sale of Chrysler. "The basic issue is that the existing situation is not survivable," said Dave Cole, chairman of the Center for Automotive Research. "The choice is are you going to do something different or are you going to die with the domestic industry." The auto contract talks have implications beyond the embattled industry. The 72-year-old UAW has historically secured wage and benefit deals that set the highest standard for American blue-collar workers, including the first contracts with health benefits and paid overtime. But Detroit-based automakers -- General Motors Corp.( GM.N ), Ford Motor Co.( F.N ) and DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler Group DCXGn.DE -- have cut more than 80,000 union jobs after losing a combined $16 billion in 2006. Daimler has also begun taking bids for Chrysler, raising the risk that the No. 4 U.S. automaker will end up with private investors determined to take a tougher line with the UAW. Analysts expect the Detroit automakers to seek concessions on health care and more flexible terms for a "jobs bank" that pays wages and benefits for jobs that have been cut. The current four-year deal between the UAW and Detroit automakers expires on September 14 and negotiations are expected to shift into high gear this summer. Under UAW President Ron Gettelfinger, the union has shown a willingness to negotiate concessions to help the automakers bring their costs down closer to their Asian rivals. Over the past two years, the UAW has agreed to more flexible factory work rules at Ford, tens of thousands of buyouts and a deal that shifted increased health-care costs to retirees and away from Ford and GM. But analysts say the UAW faces pressure to surrender more, including the assumption that one-size-fits-all, "pattern bargaining" can hold for all three Detroit automakers. "There is a great deal of uncertainty in the auto industry right now, which causes a great deal of concern among our members and their families," Gettelfinger said earlier this month. "We're doing our best to address those concerns -- but it doesn't do anybody much good to try to predict the outcome of a bargaining process that hasn't even started yet." DETROIT, WALL STREET BOTH WATCHING Chris Sherwood, president of UAW Local 652, which represents workers at a GM plant in Lansing, Michigan, said he would like to see the union maintain benefits for workers. In the last round of contract talks in 2003, the UAW agreed to job cuts, plant closures and modest wage increases to protect relatively generous health-care and pension packages. In 2003, Detroit automakers had almost 58 percent of the U.S. vehicle market, but that share is now less than 54 percent. For that reason, the UAW will likely be pressed to make further cuts, especially at Ford, which expects to burn $17 billion before returning to profitability in 2009. Chrysler is seeking health-care cuts that would put its costs on par with its larger rivals. GM, the largest private purchaser of health care in the United States, has made reducing its annual $4.8 billion health-care bill a top priority. Lehman Brothers analyst Brian Johnson estimates UAW workers make about $55 per hour, including benefits, compared with about $20 per hour in other manufacturing industries. Johnson said the best-case outcome for GM and Ford would be to cut costs for future retirees in this round of talks. That would represent a wrenching change for a union that has seen its active membership decimated since the last contract but would still leave Detroit automakers facing a cost disadvantage compared with Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ). "Change is likely to be 'historic' by Detroit standards yet minimal by Wall Street standards," Johnson said in a note for clients.
