 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - In the latest test of IPO investors' appetite for risk, wireless networking start-up Aruba Networks Inc. is set to float its shares this week, another in a raft of risky technology investments to go public this year. 

 Aruba's initial public offering is scheduled to price on Monday and will give an indication of whether a recovery in equities markets last week from their swoon in late February will make investors more sanguine about companies without a record of profits. "It definitely belongs in the category of higher risk deals," said Josef Schuster, chief executive of IPOX Schuster LLC, a financial services company that tracks IPOs. "But they have an interesting business model." Aruba makes corporate wireless network gear that provides secure access to data, voice and video applications. The company's products link desktop and laptop computers as well as other mobile devices. Already one of the biggest competitors to industry heavyweight Cisco Systems Inc. ( CSCO.O ), Aruba is poised to join a slew of offerings from computer networking companies in the last year, including Acme Packet Inc. APKT.O and Riverbed Technology Inc. ( RVBD.O ) Acme Packet and Riverbed offered shares in October and September, respectively, and went on to post two of the biggest first-day gains of 2006. As much of the investor buzz of late has focused on the $4 billion IPO filing from Blackstone Group, the IPO market has picked up its pace in terms of volume. While only 10 deals went to market from March 1 through 12, six companies went public over the last week alone with an additional 9 companies worth about $1 billion total scheduled to price by the end of the month, according to datatracker Dealogic. LACK OF PROFITS Sunnyvale, California-based Aruba has never turned a profit, a shortcoming that has sunk a number of technology offerings of late. Shares of Glu Mobile Inc. ( GLUU.O ), which publishes games for mobile phones, sank almost 10 percent Friday to trade below their $11.50 offering price, only a day after jumping 11 percent in their debut. Shares staged a late rebound to close at $11.51. Glu Mobile lost $12.2 million in 2006 compared with $18 million in 2005, despite increasing revenue to $46.2 million in 2006 from $25.7 million in 2005. Aruba Networks is also in the red, losing more than $12 million in 2006 compared with $32.6 million in 2005. The company did increase revenue to $72.5 million in 2006 from $12 million in 2005. The company's losses are due in part to heavy investment in product development, which has allowed it to maintain and possibly improve its already leading position in the market, said Chris Silva, an analyst with Forrester Research. The market for wireless networks is maturing as companies continue to upgrade to them from systems anchored by physical wires, Silva said. "An IPO puts Aruba in good position to continue to gather financial strength, to reinvest in new technologies and perhaps acquire new technologies," Silva said. While the lack of profit is a concern, the company's impressive revenue growth should carry it through, said Scott Sweet, managing director for IPO research firm IPOboutique.com. "If sales were not doubling, it would be a catastrophic situation," Sweet said. If priced at the top of a forecast range, the company could raise $80 million and give it an initial market capitalization of $752 million. The offering represents a 10.6 percent stake in the company. REINSURERS HIT MARKET Aruba will not hog all of the attention on the U.S. IPO market over the next week. Bermuda-based Flagstone Reinsurance Holdings Ltd., which provides property catastrophe reinsurance coverage to insurance companies, plans to raise almost $176 million on Thursday. The company is the second to go public among a group of reinsurers that has filed for IPOs to capitalize on a record year in profits for the industry. Shares of CastlePoint Holdings Ltd. CPHL.O, also a Bermuda-based property and casualty insurance and reinsurance company, rose as much as 13 percent in their debut Friday, raising expectations for Flagstone. Bermuda-based reinsurer Validus Holdings Ltd. and Greenlight Capital Re Ltd., a Cayman Islands-based specialty property and casualty reinsurer, also filed for IPOs earlier this year.
