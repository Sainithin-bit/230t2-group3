 LONDON  (Reuters) - Terra Firma is considering a bid for UK 
retailer Alliance Boots AB.L, a source familiar with the 
matter said on Sunday, confirming a report that the private 
equity firm had spoken to banks about an approach. 

  Alliance Boots rejected an initial 9.7 billion pound ($19 
billion) earlier in March approach from private equity firm 
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts KKR.UL and Alliance Boots executive 
deputy chairman Stefano Pessina.  The source, confirming a report in the Sunday Express, said 
that Terra Firma was sounding out investment banks, but was 
struggling to find one not already involved in a retail deal -- 
as takeover activity in the sector heats up -- to both advise 
and help it finance an eventual offer.  "(A bid) is a possibility rather than a probability," the 
source said.  Terra Firma declined to comment.  The Sunday Express also said another private equity firm, 
Permira, was understood to be interested in Kingfisher ( KGF.L ), 
whose shares gave climbed in recent days on takeover 
speculation, though a bid was not imminent.  Permira was not immediately available for comment.
