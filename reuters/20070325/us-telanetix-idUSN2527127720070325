 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc.'s ( CSCO.O ) recent agreement to buy video-conferencing technology company WebEx Communications WEBX.O for $3.2 billion bodes well for the prospects of upstart rival Telanetix TNXI.OB, Barron's said Sunday. 

 The San Diego-based start-up has a market value of $58.5 million, Barron's wrote, but competes with much bigger rivals like Cisco, Hewlett-Packard ( HPQ.N ) and Polycom Inc. ( PLCM.O ). In January, for example, Telanetix won a major contract from Mercedes-Benz USA. Citing an investor who owns just under 5 percent of Telanetix, Barron's reported the company could turn a profit this year. Sales may also take off as it announces a plan to lease its conferencing system to companies for as little as $1,000 a month. Dutton Associates, an independent research firm, predicts that Telanetix will win more sales and possibly attract takeover offer from a big rival like Cisco or HP. Telanetix shares closed at $4.00 in bulletin board trading Friday.
