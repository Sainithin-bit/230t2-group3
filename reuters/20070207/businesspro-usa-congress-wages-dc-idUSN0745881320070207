 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Yielding to Republican demands that 
the first minimum wage hike in a decade be coupled with tax 
cuts for small businesses, the Democratic-led U.S. House of 
Representatives is preparing a $1 billion tax package, a senior 
Democrat said on Wednesday. 


  House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Charles Rangel said 
his tax-writing panel will meet on Monday to draft what he said 
would be a bipartisan package of about $1 billion in small 
business tax breaks to help advance legislation to increase the 
minimum wage.  The House last month approved a bill raising the minimum 
wage over two years to $7.25 per hour from the current $5.15 
per hour minimum wage. The closely divided Senate earlier this 
month agreed to the wage increase after adding some $8.3 
billion in small business tax cuts to win Republican support.  President George W. Bush said he wants small business tax 
cuts included in any minimum wage increase. House Democrats had 
argued that businesses have been given generous tax cuts during 
the last several years and the bill should move without taxes.  But Democrats are anxious to make good on a core campaign 
promise and the House will likely act on the bill next week, 
members of the Ways and Means Committee said.  The two chambers must then reconcile their differences and 
Rangel, a New York Democrat, has made clear he thinks the 
Senate package is too big.  "When you start with $8 billion, my hearing aid is off," 
Rangel told reporters on Tuesday.
