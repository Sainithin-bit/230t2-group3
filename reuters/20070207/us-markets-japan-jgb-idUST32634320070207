 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japanese government bond futures edged up on Wednesday on a dip in the stock market as investors awaited more clues on whether the Bank of Japan will lift interest rates later this month. 


 On Thursday both BOJ Deputy Governor Kazumasa Iwata and board member Hidehiko Haru will give speeches and talk to reporters, while dealers will also face a 2.0 trillion yen auction of five-year notes. JGBs have steadily slid in the past week, lifting short-term yields from 3-1/2-month lows, as investors fret the BOJ may raise interest rates to a decade-high 0.5 percent from 0.25 percent at its meeting on February 20-21. But analysts said Iwata and Haru may not be able to give many clues on whether a rate rise is coming this month because data on consumer spending and prices has stayed soft. "We cannot expect strong enough comments or new information on monetary policy because most of the data at the end of January was disappointing," said Akihiko Yokoyama, chief JGB strategist at JPMorgan Securities. "It wasn't good enough to change the minds of the dovish BOJ members." JPMorgan expects a rate increase in March, but Yokoyama said there was a risk of any move being delayed even beyond then. Traders said they expected a quiet session ahead of events later in the week including the Group of Seven meeting in Germany. March 10-year futures drifted up 0.04 point to 134.11 but remain locked in a range between 134.96 and 133.40 in the past three weeks. The benchmark 10-year yield was unchanged at 1.740 percent. The five-year yield was also flat at 1.235 percent. Two-year yields edged up a basis point to 0.770 percent. Upcoming economic data, including December machinery orders on Friday and fourth-quarter economic growth next week, will go a long way to helping shape expectations for the BOJ's decision later this month. Market opinion remains split on whether Japan's central bank will pull the trigger and bump up rates in February, with swap contracts on the overnight call rate showing a roughly 45 percent chance of a move. The climb in the Nikkei share average to a six-year intraday peak last week has also made bond investors nervous about the underlying economy's strength. But the Nikkei fell 0.9 percent on Wednesday to 17,251. The pressure from European politicians on Japan over the weak yen in the run-up to the G7 this weekend has also made investors wary of the need for higher rates. But U.S. officials have backed Japan, with Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson telling Congress on Tuesday that the yen reflects Japan's economic fundamentals and is set in competitive markets.
