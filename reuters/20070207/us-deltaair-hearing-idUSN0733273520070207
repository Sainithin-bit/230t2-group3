 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A U.S. bankruptcy court on Wednesday allowed Delta Air Lines Inc. DALRQ.PK to begin seeking creditor approval for its reorganization plan, bringing the No. 3 U.S. carrier a big step closer to exiting bankruptcy this spring. 


 At a hearing, Judge Adlai Hardin approved Delta's disclosure statement, which details the reorganization plan, and allowed Delta to begin polling its creditors. All outstanding objections had been resolved ahead of the hearing. There seems to be little to stand in the way of a smooth exit to bankruptcy for Delta after its official creditor committee last week formally backed the airline's own plan. The decision by the influential committee, which represents Delta's unsecured creditors, ended US Airways Group Inc.'s ( LCC.N ) 11-week effort to acquire its larger rival. Delta, which has been operating under bankruptcy protection since September 2005, had planned to wrap up voting on the plan by April 9 and schedule a hearing to confirm the plan on April 25. Two-thirds of the claims, which are estimated at a total of about $15 billion, need to vote in favor of the plan for it to be approved.
