 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Boeing Co. ( BA.N ) said on Thursday it was on track to deliver its new 787 Dreamliner planes in the latter part of 2008, and expected a good year for new orders. 


 "The 787 is on schedule for its roll-out mid-summer (northern hemisphere) with first flight in late summer and delivery in the latter part of 2008," Randy Baseler, Boeing's Vice President of Marketing, told reporters in Sydney. "We still think it will be a good, solid year, it won't be a record year." Boeing said on January 31 fourth-quarter profit more than doubled as it delivered more commercial aircraft than in the year-earlier quarter and its defense unit posted record sales. The Chicago-based company, which outsold European rival Airbus ( EAD.PA ) last year, also raised its profit forecasts for this year and reassured investors that the 787, set to roll out next year, is still on schedule. The company kept its forecast for 440 to 445 airplane deliveries this year and estimated 515 to 520 deliveries next year as production ramps up.
