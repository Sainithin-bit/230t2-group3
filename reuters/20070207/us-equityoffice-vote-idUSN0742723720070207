 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Equity Office Properties Trust EOP.N shareholders on Wednesday overwhelmingly voted to approve Blackstone Group's bid of $23 billion plus the assumption of debt. 


 Equity Office said 71.3 percent of its shareholders approved the deal, which comes to $39 billion including debt, with the private equity firm. In a meeting that lasted less than 10 minutes, Equity Office, the largest private owner of U.S. office property, said only 5.38 percent of its shareholder voted against the deal. The Chicago-based company founded by real estate baron Sam Zell, said the deal could close by Friday. Earlier Wednesday, Vornado Realty Trust ( VNO.N ) withdrew its bid for Equity Office.
