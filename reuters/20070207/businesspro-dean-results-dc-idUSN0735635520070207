 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Dean Foods Co. ( DF.N ) posted higher 
quarterly profit on Wednesday, helped by higher sales by its 
White Wave organic food and soy milk unit. 


  The largest U.S. dairy company posted profit of $73.0 
million, or 53 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, compared 
with $66.2 million, or 45 cents a share, a year earlier.  Earnings from continuing operations, excluding 
plant-closing costs and other special charges, were 61 cents a 
share, matching the average forecast of analysts polled by 
Reuters Estimates.  Sales dipped to $2.59 billion from $2.62 billion due to 
lower dairy commodity costs, which the company passes through 
to consumers.  Dean also forecast earnings of 44 cents to 46 cents a share 
for the first quarter, excluding plant-closing and other 
one-time costs. For all of 2007, the company forecast earnings 
of $2.33 to $2.38 a share.  Analysts, on average, forecast 47 cents a share for the 
first quarter and $2.38 a share for the year.
