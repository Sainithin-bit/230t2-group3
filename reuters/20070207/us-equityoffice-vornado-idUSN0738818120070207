 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Vornado Realty Trust ( VNO.N ) withdrew its cash and stock proposal to acquire Equity Office Properties Trust EOP.N on Wednesday, paving the way for private equity firm Blackstone Group to take over the top U.S. office landlord for $23 billion. 


 Shareholders of Equity Office are scheduled to vote on Blackstone's offer at noon EST (1700 GMT) on Wednesday. Vornado said the premium it would have to pay to top a $55.50 per share cash bid from Blackstone BG.UL, which is protected by a $720 million breakup fee, would not be in its shareholders' interest. Vornado stock rose about 5.8 percent to $134.41, and Equity Office stock fell about 1 percent to $55.46, just below Blackstone's offer. Blackstone has been locked in a long bidding battle with Vornado for control of Chicago-based Equity Office. The duel represented the biggest-ever contest for a real estate investment trust (REIT). "The fat lady's singing," said Dean Frankel, portfolio manager at Urdang Capital Management, which owns both Equity Office and Vornado stock. "I'm not happy because ... we'd rather Vornado had bought the company," said Frankel. "But Blackstone is a great company -- their buying all these companies has helped out the REIT market. They were running the show for sure." Vornado had offered $56 per share in cash and stock for Equity Office, but the REIT had recommended Blackstone's lower bid because it is all cash and could close by Friday. Vornado's proposal could have taken months to close. Equity Office also said Vornado's latest offer had taken the form of a "nonbinding letter" that did not include definitive terms. PUBLIC VERSUS PRIVATE Some Equity Office shareholders are dedicated real estate investors whose funds are mandated to invest in REITS. For some of them, Vornado stock was as attractive as cash, given Vornado's track record in real estate. Some of these REIT investors would have preferred to see Equity Office's assets remain under the control of a publicly traded company. Nonetheless, Equity Office's biggest institutional shareholder, which had supported Vornado's offer, was satisfied with the outcome. "As an Equity Office shareholder, it turns out to have become a much better process to extract value out of this company," said Martin Cohen, co-chief executive of asset manager Cohen & Steers, which controls about 8 percent of Equity Office. "As a Vornado shareholder, I think they fought a very good battle but in the end became very disciplined and decided not to overpay. "I think it's a victory for both sets of shareholders and they should both be very proud of the outcome -- there comes a point at which the bidding has to stop and it reaches a price where there is no more profit left in it." Vornado had sweetened its proposal on February 4 by offering to speed up the  cash portion of its $56 per share offer. But given the time delay involved in Vornado's proposal, Equity Office said it was advised the net present value of the proposal was in the range of $54.81 to $55.07 per share. BIGGEST LBOs Investors in real estate, often armed with low-interest rate debt, are attracted by returns generated by rising rents, which are expected to continue to climb over the next several years, especially in cities like New York. Despite the attraction of the Equity Office portfolio -- about 590 buildings and 105 million square feet of office space -- analysts also gave Vornado credit for walking away. "The risk-return no longer made sense to them in the high $50s," said BMO Capital Markets analyst Paul Adornato. "We think that they went about this in a thoughtful matter and they pulled out of it in a thoughtful matter. You have to give Vornado credit for recognizing when it was time to pull out." Including debt, Blackstone's offer is valued about $39 billion, putting it among the biggest ever leveraged buyout deals. The battle for Equity Office involved some of the biggest personalities in the real estate and private equity industries. Equity Office was founded more than 30 years ago by real estate magnate Sam Zell. Vornado's offer pitted its chief executive, Steven Roth, against Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman, whose private equity firm has played a central role in a wave of real estate deals.
