 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. business productivity rose at a much stronger-than-expected 3.0 percent annual pace in the fourth quarter while unit labor costs moderated, in good news for the inflation-wary Federal Reserve. 


 Nonfarm business productivity, a gauge of how much any given worker produces per hour, was forecast by analysts polled by Reuters to advance 1.8 percent, compared with a revised 0.1 percent third-quarter decline reported by the Labor Department on Wednesday. U.S. stock futures extended gains on the data while U.S. Treasury debt prices were steady at lower levels, and the dollar was little moved. "The strength of productivity meant that unit labor costs remained under control despite a 4.8 percent rise in hourly compensation," Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics, said in a research note. "These numbers ought not to be seen as unduly threatening by the Fed," he said, while adding he expected weaker productivity growth and more cost pressures going forward. The rise in productivity helped moderate unit labor cost growth to a 1.7 percent annual rate, versus an expected gain of 2.1 percent and a rise of 3.2 percent in the previous three months. This was despite a jump in compensation per hour at a 4.8 percent rate, up from 3.1 percent in the third quarter. Unit labor costs are a gauge of inflation and profit pressures watched closely by the U.S. central bank. Unit labor costs rose 3.2 percent last year, the largest annual rise since 2000's 4.2 percent increase. Productivity in 2006 rose 2.1 percent, the smallest increase in nine years. "Unit labor costs were pretty tame in the quarter," said James O'Sullivan, economist at UBS Securities in Stamford, Connecticut. "If anything, labor costs are less of a concern for the Fed in terms of inflation," he said. Fed officials worry that mounting labor costs may hinder a decline in inflation from levels they say are too high. The Fed has held interest rates steady at 5.25 percent since last summer, and is expected to maintain this policy stance until the middle of the year, if not later. A pick-up in productivity growth might enhance firms' ability to lift output without pressuring labor costs, even though U.S labor market conditions are tight, with a January unemployment rate of 4.6 percent. A separate report showed U.S. mortgage applications dropped last week, as weaker demand for home purchase loans more than offset a slight uptick in refinancing activity. The Mortgage Bankers Association said its seasonally adjusted index of mortgage application activity for the week ended February 2 dipped 0.2 percent to 630.1. A four-week moving average of mortgage applications, which smooths the volatile weekly figures, moved down 1.6 percent. (Additional reporting by Julie Haviv in New York)
