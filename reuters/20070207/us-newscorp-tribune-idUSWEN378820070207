 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - News Corp.'s NWSa.N Rupert Murdoch said the company is interested in working with the Chandler family in its bid to purchase Tribune Co. TRB.N assets. 


 "We are interested quite openly; and frankly, if we could do something -- not too expensive -- that will lead to a joint operating agreement between the New York Post and Newsday," Murdoch said, responding to a question over the company's participation in the Chandler family's bid. News Corp. owns the Post; Tribune owns Newsday, the dominant newspaper on New York's Long Island. News Corp said its investment would be "small."
