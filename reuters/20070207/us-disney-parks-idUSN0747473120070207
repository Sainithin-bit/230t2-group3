 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co. ( DIS.N ) Chief Financial Officer Tom Staggs said current bookings for travel to its domestic theme parks were up about three percent compared to the same point one year ago. 


 "As we look at current bookings, we're trending slightly ahead of the prior year, about 3 percent ahead of the prior year," Staggs told reporters following the media company's release of its fiscal first quarter earnings. California-based Disney operates the Walt Disney World resort in Florida and the Disneyland park in southern California.
