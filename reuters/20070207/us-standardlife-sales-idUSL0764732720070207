 LONDON  (Reuters) - Standard Life ( SL.L ) posted one of the UK sector's strongest growth rates for 2006 as new pension rules at home helped lift full-year sales by 47 percent and the insurer said it expected the momentum to continue into 2007. 


 But the former mutual said lapses in both life and pensions policies remained "above trend" as customers cashed them in following its July initial public offering and changes to pension legislation in April. The company had boosted lapse provisions at the half year. Standard Life said on Wednesday its sales rose to 14.26 billion pounds ($27.90 billion) from 9.68 billion last year on a present value of new business premiums (PVNBP) basis. Under the alternative annual premium equivalent (APE) basis -- which smoothes out the sales of single-premium policies which account for most of the insurer's sales -- Standard Life said full-year sales rose 39 percent to 1.73 billion pounds, toward the higher end of market estimates. "This is a great result at a time when the company was executing massive corporate change," Chief Executive Sandy Crombie told reporters. "Overall the business is moving in the direction we envisaged when we carried out a strategic review in 2004. Looking ahead, we believe our prospects are bright." Standard Life's focus on pensions has made it a key beneficiary of the British government's pensions overhaul last spring, which allowed people to save more for retirement and drove sales of its key self-invested personal pension (SIPP). Sales in the insurer's core domestic market climbed 69 percent in 2006 to 11.4 billion pounds on a PVNBP basis. Under APE, sales climbed 54 percent for the 12 months and 86 percent in the fourth quarter, helped by a corporate pensions contract. LAPSE WORRIES Lapses at home, however, remained strong. Standard Life announced a 100 million pound increase in provisions for policy lapses last September. It said on Wednesday that it was too soon to say whether it would take an additional charge. "We're monitoring the position because at this time of year, as we prepare the year-end results, we review all our long-term assumptions," Finance Director David Nish said, adding there was "short-term data" the insurer had to consider. Standard Life shares, which have climbed more than 24 percent since they were listed in July, were up 1.2 percent at 0947 GMT at 308 pence. "The headline figures are as expected. Canada continues to be a problem area but everything else looks good," analyst Roman Cizdyn at Oriel Securities said. In Canada, Standard Life's largest overseas market, sales dropped 15 percent to 166 million pounds and the insurer said it expected conditions to remain tough in 2007. Asset manager Standard Life Investments saw funds under management rise 11 percent to 132.1 billion pounds, with third- party funds under management up 32 percent.
