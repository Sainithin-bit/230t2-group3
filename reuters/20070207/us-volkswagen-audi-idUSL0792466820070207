 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Volkswagen's ( VOWG.DE ) premium unit Audi AG ( NSUG.DE ) increased sales at its flasghip Audi brand in January by 8.0 percent to 75,150 vehicles, Audi said on Wednesday. 


 It was a record high for the month of January. "Growth came for the most part from the Q7 and the TT," a spokesman for Audi said, referring to its all new full-size sport utility vehicle and the second generation of its Hungarian-built TT roadster. On Tuesday, DaimlerChrysler DCXGn.DE reported that sales of rival luxury brand Mercedes-Benz rose 13.9 percent to 73,500. Apart from last month, the last time that demand for Audi brand vehicles outstripped that of Mercedes-Benz was in January 2006.
