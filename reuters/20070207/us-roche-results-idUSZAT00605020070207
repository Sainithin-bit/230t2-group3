 BASEL, Switzerland  (Reuters) - Profits at Roche Holding AG leapt 34 percent in 2006 on strong sales of cancer treatments Herceptin and Avastin and flu drug Tamiflu but worries over future margins hit the stock on Wednesday. 


 Results from the Swiss healthcare group were broadly in line with analyst expectations, with net income of 9.17 billion Swiss francs ($7.33 billion) close to the average forecast of 9.11 billion francs in a Reuters poll of 15 analysts. The figures, however, disappointed those hoping for more from the darling of the European pharmaceuticals sector and cautious comments on prospects for margin expansion in 2007 knocked the stock back from recent record highs. Roche certificates fell 2.7 percent to 232 francs by 1000 GMT, after scaling an all-time high of 241.40 on Tuesday. For the coming year, Roche expects above market sales growth in both its pharmaceuticals and diagnostics divisions -- with the group as a whole and pharma showing double digit percentage growth rates in local currencies -- although pandemic sales of Tamiflu are expected to ease compared to 2006. Core earnings per share, meanwhile, are forecast to grow in line with sales. "In spite of higher than expected sales, the profit split within the pharmaceuticals is worse than expected and the profit contribution from diagnostics is lower than forecast," said bank Vontobel analyst Karl-Heinz Koch. "This, together with the EPS growth outlook provided by management, raises some question markets regarding earnings estimates." Tim Anderson of Prudential Financial said profit margins were lower than he predicted because of higher spending. HOW TO SPEND CASH PILE? Six years ago, Roche was the sick man of the European sector, following a series of product setbacks. But its strong portfolio of new drugs to fight cancer -- the fastest growing area of medical advances -- has recently led to growth at the top end of the pharmaceutical industry, with drug sales doubling and profits tripling in the past five years. The Basel-based company's full-year sales rose 17 percent to 42.04 billion francs, which compared with the average forecast of 41.65 billion francs. Fourth-quarter group sales were up 18 percent year-on-year, but slightly behind the year-on-year growth rate of 20 percent in the third quarter of 2006. Full-year drugs sales were 33.29 billion francs, up 21 percent in local currencies from 2005 and just ahead of analyst expectations of 32.94 billion francs. Roche's recent success has created a cash pile of 24.3 billion francs but Chairman and Chief Executive Franz Humer, who announced a 36 percent dividend increase to 3.40 francs a share, said there was no pressure to go on a spending spree. "A big acquisition makes no sense for us," he told reporters. "The cash is not burning a hole in our pocket." Humer added Roche might raise its stakes in U.S. biotech partner Genentech Inc and Japan's Chugai Pharmaceutical but a group share buyback program was unlikely. STRONG PIPELINE Pharmaceuticals head William Burns said Roche was developing multiple new uses for its top cancer drugs and it also had a strong line-up of new products in development. Rheumatoid arthritis drug Actemra will be the key new drug submission in 2007, he told analysts, and the company will also make a decision in the second half on whether to move into final clinical trials with a drug to raise "good" cholesterol. Roche's experimental medicine works in a similar way to Pfizer Inc's torcetrapib, which failed in December. But Burns said data on its product so far had been good. He predicted 2007 sales of Tamiflu to governments building stockpiles in the event of a flu pandemic to be lower than last year at 0.8 billion to 1.2 billion Swiss francs, down from 1.8 billion francs in 2006, when government orders accounted for 70 percent of total Tamiflu revenues. Roche said it now had manufacturing capacity for Tamiflu that exceeded all government orders to date. Roche stock commands a lofty premium to the sector, reflecting the strength of its business and low exposure to patent risk. It trades at more than 21 times forecast 2007 earnings, according to Reuters data, against 17 times for cross-town rival Novartis AG. "When you are on a high valuation like this, you have to constantly outperform to get a positive share reaction," commented Dresdner Kleinwort analyst Ben Yeoh.
