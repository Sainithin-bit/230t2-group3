 LONDON  (Reuters) - World stocks bumped along near record highs on Wednesday while investors' search for yield kept emerging market and corporate bonds closer to government debt than ever before. 


 European shares were higher, helping hold the MSCI all-world index slightly below its all-time record hit on Tuesday. The yen slipped against the dollar and the euro was flat amid nervousness about the weekend's Group of Seven meeting. European bonds were flat. Investors have poured money into  European stocks as the global economy has remain robust and liquidity plentiful despite worries of a slowdown. This has lifted the likes of the FTSEurofirst up more than 4 percent in just over a month. The index was slightly higher on Wednesday. "The fact is that the expansion of the global economy is proving to be far more durable than expected," Mike Lenhoff, chief strategist at Brewin Dolphin wealth managers, said in a note. Britain's FTSE 100 was flat, while France's CAC 40 was up 0.2 percent and Germany's DAX up 0.3 percent. Earlier, Japanese shares fell but the Australian market rose to fresh record highs. Japan's Nikkei ended down nearly 0.7 percent at its lowest close in three weeks as shares in technology firms and other exporters were hit by a recent burst of relative yen strength. One result of relatively low interest rates and abundant liquidity, meanwhile, has been the willingness of investors to but riskier assets. The tight spread between yields of emerging market bonds and U.S. Treasuries remained close to record levels on Wednesday. The same can be said for corporate debt. DOLLAR, BONDS The yen resumed its decline against the dollar and euro as investors eased back ahead of this weekend's G7 meeting, where the Japanese currency's weakness is set to be discussed. The yen's slide of some 16 percent in the past three years to successive record lows against the euro has captured market attention, with European officials determined to take the issue up at the G7 meeting in Essen, Germany, on February 9-10. The dollar was up a third of a percent on the day at 120.44 yen. The euro also gained 0.3 percent to 156.38 yen, rebounding from a three-week lows hit on Tuesday. The single currency was flat against the dollar at $1.2986. Euro zone bonds were flat with the 10-year bond yielding 4.03 percent.
