 BASEL, Switzerland  (Reuters) - Swiss drugmaker Roche Holding AG ( ROG.VX ) may increase its stakes in Genentech DNA.N and Chugai Pharmaceutical ( 4519.T ) but is not interested in large acquisitions, its chief executive said on Wednesday. 


 "A big acquisition makes no sense for us," Chief Executive Officer Franz Humer told reporters. "The cash is not burning a hole in our pocket."
