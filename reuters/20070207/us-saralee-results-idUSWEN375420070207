 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Sara Lee Corp. SLE.N posted a quarterly loss on Wednesday, hurt by charges to account for the lower value of some assets. 


 The maker of Sara Lee baked goods, Kiwi shoe polish and Douwe Egberts coffee said its net loss was $62 million, or 8 cents a share, in the fiscal second quarter ended December 30, compared with profit of $438 million, or 57 cents a share, a year earlier. Sara Lee posted a gain from discontinued operations in the year-earlier quarter. Sara Lee in September completed a major restructuring that saw it sell or spin off units, including the Hanesbrands Inc. ( HBI.N ) apparel business, in order to focus on coffee and tea, deli meats, baked goods and European household products.
