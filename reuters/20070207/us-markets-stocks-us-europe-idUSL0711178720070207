 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - U.S. shares look set to open higher on Wednesday with technology shares in focus after better-than-expected results from Cisco ( CSCO.O ) on Tuesday, while investors also eye U.S. labor cost data. 


 A better-than-expected outlook and earnings from Cisco Systems after the bell drove the network equipment maker's shares sharply higher and could give the technology sector a boost in Wednesday's session, dealers said. "The futures look quite friendly and are mainly driven by Cisco," said Roland Hirschmueller, a trader for U.S. shares at Baader brokerage. By 1034 GMT, U.S. stock futures were pointing to opening gains of between 0.02 percent and 0.3 percent for the three main indexes SPc1 DJc1 NDc1. Major earnings on Wednesday include quarterly results from Moody's Corp ( MCO.N ), life insurer Prudential Financial ( PRU.N ), technology service provider Electronic Data Systems EDS.N, and appliance maker Whirlpool Corp ( WHR.N ). On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  rose 0.04 percent, to end at 12,666.31, while the Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  added 0.07 percent and the Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  inched up 0.04 percent. "The trend clearly points upwards," Hirschmueller said. "Amid all uneasiness, whoever is invested should stay invested and party on." On the macro economic front, investors will eye preliminary fourth-quarter productivity and labor-costs data at 1330 GMT for clues on the state of the U.S. economy and future interest rate developments. Economists in a Reuters survey forecast a median increase in productivity of 1.8 percent versus a rise of 0.2 percent in the third quarter. Unit labor costs are seen up 2.1 percent compared with a 2.3 percent rise in the previous quarter. U.S. crude oil futures for March delivery CLc1 rose 51 cents to $59.39 a barrel. Cold weather in the U.S. Northeast, the single largest heating oil market, and a shift in investment flows have lifted oil from a 20-month low of $49.90 on January 18.
