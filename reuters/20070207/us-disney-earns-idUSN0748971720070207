 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co. ( DIS.N ) said on Wednesday that first quarter net earnings more than doubled from a year ago, driven by DVD sales of "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest" and "Cars" and by the sale of an E! Entertainment stake. 


 Shares rose 1.6 percent in after-hours trading. Disney said net income rose to $1.7 billion, or 79 cents per share, from $734 million, or 37 cents per share in last year's first quarter. Excluding the 23-cent per share gain from the E! sale and other items, Disney posted earnings of 50 cents per share, topping the Wall Street target of 39 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 10 percent to $9.7 billion, topping the analyst consensus of $9.5 billion. "Great, great numbers all the way around. Very strong especially at the studio, although it will be interesting to see if the market gives them credit," said David Miller, an analyst at Sanders Morris Harris. Studio operating profit jumped to $604 million from $128 million on DVD sales of live-action picture "Pirates" and animated films "Cars" and "Little Mermaid Platinum Release." Media profit rose 24 percent to $750 million, in part as international Disney Channel subscriptions rose. Parks earnings rose 8 percent to $405 million. Consumer products profit fell 13 percent to $235 million. "Obviously the highlight of the quarter was the studio and they posted far and away what is a record for them," Chief Financial Officer Tom Staggs told reporters, pointing to DVD sales. For the parks unit, Disney said that guests spent more at Disney World in Florida but that Hong Kong Disneyland and the main Southern California-based Disneyland, which had a 50th anniversary celebration the year before, both saw drops in attendance and guest spending. Staggs said current bookings for travel to Disney's domestic theme parks were up about 3 percent compared to the same point one year ago. In addition to the gain from the sale of its interest in E! Entertainment Television, Disney's most recent quarter included a gain of 8 cents a share from the sale of an Us Weekly magazine stake and a charge of one cent per share related to equity-based compensation. Disney has enjoyed robust earnings growth and a return to favor with investors since Robert Iger took over as chief executive in late 2005 and began an aggressive program to expand the company's global reach, revitalize its animation division and push the boundaries of digital distribution. The company's share price rose 12 percent during the quarter and now trades at about 20.3 times projected 2007 earnings. Rival Time Warner Inc ( TWX.N ) trades at a multiple of 21.2 times 2007 earnings and Viacom Inc VIA.N, at a multiple of 20.6. Shares rose to $36.05 in after hours trade from a close of $35.48 on the New York Stock Exchange.
