 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The yen dropped against the dollar and euro on Wednesday as expectations increased that Group of Seven finance officials will not take a tough stance on the Japanese currency's broad weakness at their weekend meeting. 


 A senior official at Japan's Finance Ministry said on Wednesday the yen could be discussed at the G7 gathering in Essen, Germany, but that it was unlikely to be the main subject of the talks. That followed comments from U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Tuesday saying the yen's value was set by market fundamentals, suggesting Washington does not have a problem with the weak currency. "Everybody is going against the yen on the assumption that the G7 meeting would be a nonevent," said Boris Schlossberg, senior currency strategist at DailyFX.com in New York. "The general sentiment is that there would be no punitive language directed toward the yen's weakness. That created some flow of funds back into euro/yen and drove euro/dollar all the way to $1.30 earlier," he added. Midday in New York, the dollar was up 0.5 percent on the day at 120.66 yen  JPY= . The euro gained 0.8 percent to 157.09 yen EURJPY=, rebounding from three-week lows hit on Tuesday. Comments by Paulson and the Japanese finance official were in stark contrast to those of German Deputy Finance Minister Thomas Mirow, who said on Wednesday that a discussion of foreign exchange rates will play a key role at the G7 and that the yen is "an important currency." The G7 meeting will be held on Friday and Saturday. Mirow's remarks added a tinge of uncertainty in the market, prompting some traders not to rule out buying the yen again later in the session. European officials, in general, have been unhappy about the yen's weakness because it makes their exports more expensive in Japan. With the markets focused on the yen, Wednesday's economic data on U.S. business productivity for the fourth quarter had little impact. Non-farm productivity rose at a much stronger-than-expected 3.0 percent annual pace, but the dollar hardly budged. See <ID:nN07416498>. "The upshot is the data will not change broad impressions on productivity or unit labor costs much and the market impact is seen as limited," said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital. The euro rose 0.3 percent against the dollar at $1.3019  EUR= , as markets ran through stops above $1.3010, traders say. Brian Dolan, director of FX research at Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey, said the euro really needs to take out the $1.3067 level for the market to be more comfortable with the currency's upside. Against the Swiss franc, the dollar was little changed at 1.2395 francs  CHF= . Aside from the G7 meeting, markets are also awaiting rate decisions from the Bank of England and European Central Bank on Thursday. The BoE's Monetary Policy Committee is widely expected to leave rates on hold at 5.25 percent. But following its surprise rate increase last month, traders are not entirely dismissing the MPC's ability to surprise again. The ECB is also expected to keep interest rates on hold at 3.5 percent and traders are awaiting post-meeting comments from ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet for clues on where euro zone rates are headed.
