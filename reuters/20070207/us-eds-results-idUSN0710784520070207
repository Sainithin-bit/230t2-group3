 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Electronic Data Systems Corp. reported a higher quarterly profit on Wednesday, boosted by a surge in new orders for its technology services. 


 EDS, the world's No. 2 technology services provider after IBM, reported fourth-quarter net income of $217 million, or 40 cents a share, compared with $112 million, or 21 cents a year earlier. Quarterly revenue at the Plano, Texas company that was once owned by automaker General Motors Corp. rose to $5.7 billion from $5.15 billion. EDS has reported improved results as it reaps the benefits of new business that it has signed over the past year, which includes large deals with Kraft Foods, Bank of America and the U.S. government. The company said it had quarterly profit excluding items of $254 million, or 47 cents a share. Analysts were expecting the company to report profit of 37 cents a share on revenue of $5.57 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. EDS said that it booked $7.6 billion in new business during the quarter, up 43 percent from a year earlier. Vodafone , the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the UK Ministry of Defense were among the customers that signed significant contracts, the company said. It said that it expects to report first-quarter profit excluding items of 17 to 22 cents a share on revenue of $5.1 billion to $5.3 billion. It also said it expects to report 2007 profit excluding items of $1.60 a share on revenue of $22.0 billion to $22.5 billion. Analysts were expecting EDS to report first-quarter profit of 23 cents a share on revenue of $5.26 billion and full-year profit of $1.42 on revenue of $21.99 billion. The company's shares trade at about 19 times the average analyst forecast for next year's earnings per share, according to Reuters Estimates. That is a premium to International Business Machines Corp., which trades at 14 times, and Computer Sciences Corp., whose forward P/E ratio is 13.
