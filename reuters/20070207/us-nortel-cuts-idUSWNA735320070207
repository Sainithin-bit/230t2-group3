 TORONTO  (Reuters) - Nortel Networks Corp. NT.TO NT.N will slash 2,900 jobs, or 8.5 percent of its workforce, over the next two years and shift another 1,000 employees to lower-cost locations like China, India and Mexico as North America's biggest maker of telephone equipment struggles to shore up its profits. 


 Nortel, which currently employs about 34,000 workers, said on Wednesday it will also reduce its global real estate portfolio by 500,000 square feet in 2007. At the end of 2006, Nortel occupied about 11 million square feet of real estate. It said the two moves would save about $400 million a year when completed. The news sent shares of Nortel jumping C$1.28, or 4.2 percent, to C$31.95, on the Toronto Stock Exchange. In New York, the stock was up $1.09 at $27.02. "These are tough but necessary measures," Chief Executive Mike Zafirovski said in a statement. He said Nortel will try to redeploy affected workers elsewhere in the company. In a conference call with analysts, Zafirovski said a large chunk of the cuts will affect the general-and-administrative area, as Nortel tries to bring down those expenses to between 5 percent and 6 percent of revenue, from 11 percent. Nortel will crimp spending on research and development to "an industry-competitive" 15 percent of total revenue, from about 17 percent. "The reductions are mostly in the legacy areas," Zafirovski told analysts. "This is products which are in the mature stages of the portfolio." The cuts to jobs and real estate will cost as much as $390 million, including about $300 million for the job cuts. About three-quarters of the costs will be booked as charges on the income statement in 2007, Nortel said. This is the latest round of job cuts at Nortel, which once employed about 90,000 people. Last June, the company said it would cut 1,100 jobs and alter its pension plans in an attempt to contain costs. Nortel also said it expected fourth-quarter revenue to grow to $3.26 billion, up from $3 billion in the same quarter of 2005. Analysts had been expecting fourth quarter revenue of $3.21 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Gross margin, a key measure of the success of the company's turnaround effort, is expected to be "slightly above 40 percent of revenue," up from 39.4 percent a year earlier. Nortel's joint venture with electronics maker LG Electronics Inc 066570.K as well as its CDMA wireless segment, are expected to be strong contributors, the Canadian company said. Nortel's departing chief financial officer Peter Currie was also present on the conference call. On Tuesday, the company said Currie would leave effective April 30. The timing of the announcement prompted concern from investors and analysts. Nortel was rocked by an accounting scandal several years ago which forced rounds of restatements and led to a multibillion dollar class action lawsuit from shareholders. However, Currie said his decision was simply disclosed as soon as it was made and finalized. "My commitment remains unabated until the last moment," he added. ($1=$1.18 Canadian)
