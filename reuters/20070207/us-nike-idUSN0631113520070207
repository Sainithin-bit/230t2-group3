 BEAVERTON, Oregon  (Reuters) - Nike Inc. Chief Executive Mark Parker said on Tuesday worldwide revenue could rise 53 percent to $23 billion within five years, as it tries to foster more loyalty among customers to its iconic brand. 


 Speaking at an investor conference at Nike headquarters, Parker and other executives stressed how Nike's connection with consumers and a new focus on six main athletic target areas will drive demand, together with innovative product design. As part of the shift to more customized offerings to consumers, the Beaverton, Oregon-based company said it would open 100 stores worldwide in the next three years in premium shopping areas, with half of them in the United States. "Nike is as hungry and as driven as we've ever been before and becoming more focused and more competitive," Parker said. Analyst Sara Hasan of McAdams, Wright and Ragen said the $23 billion target indicates the potential upside for the world's largest manufacturer of athletic footwear and apparel. "People forget -- yes, Nike has been around forever but it still has a lot of growth ahead of it," Hasan said. The stores will be an opportunity to focus on "premium consumer experiences" that will elevate the brand and provide a testing ground for new products, Parker said, which should help to differentiate Nike from competitors. Analysts forecasting Nike would announce a new retail strategy at Tuesday's meeting had theorized in recent weeks that Nike needed a secure platform to grow its apparel business amid growing competition from upstart brand Under Armor Inc. and recent sluggishness at U.S. mall-based athletic footwear retailers such as Foot Locker Inc. and Finish Line Inc.. Nike President of Global Operations Gary DeStefano stressed that one goal was to make Nike a better partner for retailers. "This is not about Nike versus the retailers," he said. "This is a partnership. We believe this could be a growth strategy for our industry." Nike said it sees its direct-to-retail business, which includes its stores, outlets and e-commerce division, increasing to 15 percent of total sales within five years from 12 percent today. The percentage of total sales to Nike's retail partners -- now 80 percent -- is not expected to change, the company said. Due to planned retail investment, Nike expects capital spending to increase to $475 million per year within the next few years, Chief Financial Officer Don Blair said. Growth may also come from acquisitions and emerging markets. China is eventually expected to become Nike's second-largest market behind the United States with potential sales of $1 billion and India has seen 40 percent growth within the last year through Nike's efforts in cricket, the company said. Nike, which has expanded its product offerings through acquisitions including surf brand Hurley and sneaker brand Converse, said any further acquisitions would need to fill a void in its portfolio. "We have plenty of capital capacity," Blair said. "The key is finding one where we can find shareholder value." To improve gross margins, Blair said Nike would try to manage its supply chain more efficiently, reduce waste in product design, and benefit from volume purchasing of raw materials. Moreover, Nike will create opportunities for customers to buy more premium products, lifting margins, he said. Executives cited the recent success among runners and music fans of Nike+, shoes that tell the wearer how far they have run via Apple Inc.'s iPod, as an example of innovation that drives market expansion. In August, Nike announced it segmented its business into six categories -- running, men's training, basketball, soccer, women's fitness and sports culture -- to better focus on customers' specific needs.
