 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Whirlpool Corp. ( WHR.N ) reported a 13 percent drop in quarterly earnings on Wednesday, hurt by soft U.S. demand for appliances amid a weak housing market, and it cut its profit forecast for the year, sending its shares down 3 percent. 


 The world's biggest appliance maker said it expects higher metals costs and lower industry shipments in North America, its biggest market, to weigh on 2007 results. "With the Fed increasing rates, that put the brakes on housing and refinancing," said Mirko Mikelic, senior portfolio manager at Fifth Third Asset Management. "Sales are strongly correlated with the housing market." Fourth-quarter net earnings fell to $109 million, or $1.37 a share, from $126 million, or $1.83 a share, a year earlier. The latest results included a loss of 30 cents a share from discontinued operations tied to assets acquired in the purchase of smaller rival Maytag last year. Profit from continuing operations -- including results, costs and accounting impact from the Maytag buyout -- came to $133 million, or $1.67 a share. Analysts' average forecast was $1.47 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Total sales rose 25 percent to $5 billion, helped by the inclusion of Maytag and strong international demand. U.S. WEAKNESS In North America, which accounts for about 65 percent of Whirlpool's sales, revenue rose 29 percent to $3.2 billion. But excluding Maytag, sales were down 4 percent. Operating profit in the region fell $79 million in the quarter due to materials and acquisition costs. Industrywide shipments of washers, refrigerators and other major appliances -- a key measure known as industry unit shipments -- fell about 8 percent in North America during the quarter, hurting margins. In 2006, U.S. industry shipments fell about 1 percent in North America, and Whirlpool said it expects a 2 percent to 3 percent shipment decline in that key market this year. "We've had a string of record years in appliances before this downturn," said Laura Champine, an analyst with Morgan Keegan. "When interest rates were low, there was unnaturally healthy demand and we're starting to see the other side of that." Maytag lost market share in the quarter, but Whirlpool said it expects the brand to regain sales with products being introduced this year. Revenue rose 15 percent in Europe, 26 percent in Latin America, and 12 percent in Asia. Whirlpool said it expects appliance shipments to increase this year in those three regions. Whirlpool forecast 2007 profit from continuing operations of $8 to $8.50 a share, down from its October forecast of about $9 a share. The company said costs of metals such as copper and zinc would rise about $400 million this year, and said U.S. appliance demand would fall 5 percent in the first half and improve modestly during the second half. Analysts, on average, expect profit of $8.61 a share for 2007, according to Reuters Estimates. The Benton Harbor, Michigan, manufacturer said cost savings from its Maytag purchase and price increases would help offset the higher costs. It still expects savings of more than $400 million by 2008 as it closes Maytag plants and makes appliances more efficiently. As a result of the 2006 Maytag buyout, which included the Amana and Jenn-Air brands, Whirlpool became the world's biggest appliance company. Results from Dixie-Narco vending systems, Hoover vacuums and Jade commercial appliances, other assets acquired in the Maytag deal, were included in fourth-quarter discontinued operations, Whirlpool said. Dixie-Narco and Hoover have been sold. Whirlpool shares were off $2.79 at $92.10 in afternoon New York Stock Exchange trading. The stock is up about 11 percent so far this year.
