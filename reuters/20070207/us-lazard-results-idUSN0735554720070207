 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Merger advisory firm Lazard Ltd. ( LAZ.N ) reported a 50 percent increase in fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday, beating analysts' forecasts with its best merger and acquisition results in six years. 


 "While everyone knows M&A has been strong, these numbers came in better than the Street expected," said Adam Compton, an analyst and fund manager at RCM Global Investors in San Francisco. Lazard shares were up $3.25, or 6.2 percent, to $55.48 in midday trade on the New York Stock Exchange after reaching an all-time high of $56.90 earlier in the session. Earnings rose to $85.8 million, or 78 cents a share, from $57.3 million, or 57 cents a share, a year earlier. Net revenue rose 29 percent to $472.9 million. Analysts, on average, had expected earnings of 62 cents a share on revenue of $416 million, according to Reuters Estimates. Compton attributed much of Lazard's outperformance to its asset management business, which has been growing rapidly after years of poor results. "People owned the stock for the exposure to the M&A cycle and the strength there, but they showed strength on the asset management side as well," he said. Lazard reports earnings assuming the full exchange of ownership interests held by the firm's senior partners into common stock. The 159-year-old firm went public in May 2005 and is run by veteran dealmaker Bruce Wasserstein. Lazard and its partners converted partnership interests and sold 14.1 million shares to the public in December. The firm's sales raised $350 million, which will be used to help expand its advisory and asset management businesses. GROWTH PLANS Wasserstein, in a conference call with analysts, said Lazard has considered expansion into new markets and industry coverage. Lazard recently opened an office in Beijing, but the New York-based firm also wants to get bigger closer to home. "In the United States we continue to see many growth opportunities," Wasserstein said, "filling out the frame that we have in extending and deepening Lazard's geographic reach" in the U.S. West Coast, Texas and Midwest. The firm is open to buying niche advisory firms as an alternative to hiring multiple bankers, he said. Lazard also has been debating building a private wealth management business, like it has in France, in the United States. The fourth-quarter results reflect a surge in completed mergers and acquisitions as industrywide M&A activity soared to a record. Lazard also bounced back from the third quarter, when a number of pending deals did not close. M&A revenue in the quarter rose 35 percent from a year earlier to $247.5 million, the highest since the end of 2000. Overall financial advisory revenue rose 27 percent to a record $302 million, and Lazard sees the M&A boom continuing. "Our financial advisory business remains strong," Vice Chairman Steve Golub said in an interview. "The trends that are out there -- relatively low interest rates, lots of liquidity, CEO confidence -- say our M&A business will continue to prosper as we go forward." BIGGEST BOUTIQUE Lazard, far smaller then Wall Street titans that also invest and finance deals, is the biggest independent M&A specialist, with offices in 16 countries. Last year its M&A fees were nearly twice those of Bear Stearns Cos. BSC.N and on a par with those of Lehman Brothers LEH.N, according to Dealogic. Last year Lazard ranked 10th in global announced M&A, down from ninth in 2005, Dealogic said. Among the major deals Lazard advised on during the fourth quarter were Pfizer Inc.'s ( PFE.N ) $16.6 billion sale of its consumer health-care unit to Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ.N ); a Cerberus Capital Management-led purchase of a stake in General Motors Corp.'s ( GM.N ) financing arm, GMAC, for $14 billion; and Fisher Scientific International Inc.'s $12.8 billion merger with Thermo Electron. Lazard's fourth-quarter restructuring revenue fell 11 percent to $20.4 million as corporate default rates remained near record lows. The biggest improvement came in its asset-management unit, where revenue rose 25 percent to a record $174.6 million after years of poor performance. Management fees rose as assets grew 25 percent to a record $110.4 billion last year. "We believe we've successfully completed our three-year plan in asset management," Golub said. "You've seen growth in assets under management and we expect those assets will continue to grow as we go into the first quarter." Golub noted that earnings rose faster than revenue as both compensation and other costs fell as a percentage of revenue.
