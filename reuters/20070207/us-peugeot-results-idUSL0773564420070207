 PARIS  (Reuters) - The new chief executive of PSA Peugeot Citroen ( PEUP.PA ) said new models and an improvement in quality would be key to the future of Europe's second-biggest car group after Volkswagen ( VOWG.DE ). 


 But its shares, which initially rose more than 5 percent, pared gains as analysts said some investors might be disappointed by a lack of detail in CEO Christian Streiff's outlook. Peugeot Citroen reported a steep decline in its 2006 consolidated operating margin to 2.0 percent from 3.4 percent in 2005 on Wednesday, but the fall was less than analysts had forecast. Streiff said he would unveil a plan for the period to 2010 in May and outline a vision for the period after that in September. Streiff said there were no taboos about any alliances with other companies. "We will look with an open mind at the opportunities that present themselves," he said, adding that entering the U.S. market and developing a low-cost car were among options he could consider. "Priority number one for the next month, the next year, the next decade, is quality," Streiff said at an analyst presentation the day after he was officially appointed by the supervisory board to succeed Jean-Martin Folz. He told a news conference that he had appointed task groups and given them 100 days to come up with solutions for specific problems. "We suspect the market will be disappointed there wasn't even a hint of his contrarian style," Nomura analyst Michael Tyndall said. "If no details are forthcoming we expect the stock to give back some of its recent gains," he said. At 1056 GMT, Peugeot Citroen shares were up 1 percent at 52.65 euros. The stock trades at a lower enterprise value to expected operating profit multiple than Volkswagen and Renault ( RENA.PA ). Peugeot Citroen said group sales had increased in the fourth quarter after declines in the second and third quarters. The operating margin at its automobile division -- stripping out the Banque PSA bank, Gefco transport unit and Faurecia ( EPED.PA ) parts subsidiary -- fell to 0.6 percent in 2006 from 2.0 percent in 2005. The average forecast by 22 analysts for consolidated operating margin -- or earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) -- was 1.7 percent, according to Reuters Estimates. For the second half, the margin was 1.6 percent against expectations of 1.1 percent and 2.4 percent in the first half. "It is the first time they beat consensus numbers in I think a couple of years and it may be a big enough beat to drive a modest consensus upgrade for the first time in years," said analyst Adam Jonas at Morgan Stanley. "It's too soon to tell but based on these numbers by themselves without any further detail from the company it may suggest that Peugeot has reached a bottom," he added. Peugeot Citroen said 2007 would remain difficult but new models would spur a return to unit sales growth in Europe. "In 2007, the European market looks set to remain stable and the environment will continue to be shaped by rampant competition," the company said. Outgoing Finance Director Yann Delabriere said the group was keeping its target for cost cuts of 600 million euros per year for 2007. He said raw material costs are expected to be 300 million euros higher this year compared with last, but that was an improvement on 2006 when the rise was 429 million. WEAKENED RESULTS Consolidated 2006 sales were up 0.6 percent to 56.59 billion euros and after 1.6 percent and 1.8 percent declines in the second and third quarters, they rose 3.2 percent in the fourth, the company said. Group EBIT fell to 1.12 billion euros from 1.94 billion. Net attributable profit dropped to 176 million from 1.03 billion for an earnings per share of 0.77 euros versus 4.47 euros. There was a second-half net loss of 127 million euros. The company said the results were "severely weakened" by a fall in production volumes, changes to the product and geographic mixes, emission compliance costs and higher raw materials prices. It had an expense of 855 million euros in 2006, compared with 351 million in 2005, due to impairment losses at Faurecia and in its car and motor cycle operations, and rationalization costs including the closure of its Ryton plant in Britain.
