 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) will revive the Taurus nameplate just months after it was discontinued, attaching the once top-selling name to its struggling Five Hundred sedan. 


 "We never should have walked away from the equity we had built up in the Taurus and Sable nameplate," Mark Fields, president of Ford's Americas unit, said in a speech at the Chicago auto show. Ford Chief Executive Alan Mulally, who replaced Bill Ford Jr. in September, has questioned the automaker's decision to drop the Taurus brand, which is credited with reviving profits at Ford during the late 1980s. Mulally, a former executive at Boeing, had studied the development of the Taurus while at the aircraft maker to help improve the way planes were built. The Taurus, introduced in 1985, redefined American car design with its jelly bean shape and went on to become the top-selling model in United States for five years between 1992 and 1997. But in recent years the sedan was sold mostly to rental car and corporate fleets, and Ford discontinued it in October. The Five Hundred will be renamed Taurus when a redesigned version goes on sale this summer. The automaker's Mercury Montego will be renamed Sable, after the Taurus counterpart, and its Freestyle wagon will be rebranded as Taurus X, Fields said. "I realize that we will probably take some shots on our naming strategy, but again, we keep going back to what's right for our customers and what's right for our business," Fields said. Ford announced in January that the 2008 Five Hundred would get increased horsepower, an improved transmission, a new all-wheel drive system and electronic stability control. The model is expected to be on sale by summer. The Five Hundred sedan, which has been criticized for its bland styling, has lagged in sales since its launch in 2004. Last year, sales declined 22 percent to 84,218 vehicles. Morningstar analyst John Novak questioned the decision to marry the Taurus name to the Five Hundred, which has fallen short of expectations by any measure. "The car's name is kind of synonymous with the decline of Ford at this point," Novak said of the Taurus. "This was the best-selling sedan that was blown to pieces by the Camry over the last few years and became a rental car." "The car's name at one point had brand equity, but rebadging a lackluster vehicle doesn't seem to make much sense," Novak said. "If you were going to do this, why not hold the name for a year or two until you have a blockbuster sedan and then put it on?" Ford is struggling to stem its U.S. sales slide. The automaker's sales declined 8 percent in 2006 and nearly 23 percent in January as it reduced sales to rental car fleets. The company is in deep trouble financially, losing $12.7 billion in 2006, the worst loss in its 103-year history. (Additional reporting by  David Bailey  and  James Kelleher )
