 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Moody's Corp. ( MCO.N ), the parent of its namesake credit rating agency, on Wednesday said fourth-quarter profit soared 86 percent, helped by growing demand for ratings and a gain from the sale of its downtown Manhattan headquarters. 


 Net income for New York-based Moody's rose to $278.6 million, or 97 cents per share, from $150.1 million, or 50 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding a $160.6 million pretax gain from the building sale, profit totaled 64 cents per share, 5 cents above the average forecast of analysts polled by Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 25 percent to $590 million, topping the average $552.3 million forecast. Moody's largest shareholder is Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. ( BRKa.N ) ( BRKb.N ). On a conference call, Chief Executive Raymond McDaniel said Moody's is benefiting with "merger and acquisition activity (and) leveraged buyout activity remaining reasonably strong, and that's associated with the liquidity in the market (and) the tight spreads that are available." Moody's shares rose 98 cents to $73.59 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Revenue from structured finance rose 27 percent, helped by growth in collateralized debt obligations and commercial mortgage-backed securities. Structured finance involves securities backed by such things as mortgages and credit cards. Corporate finance ratings revenue, meanwhile, rose 31 percent, as increased merger activity fueled demand for ratings for investment-grade and "junk" bonds. McDaniel said, however, that merger and LBO activity will likely moderate. Moody's expects low double-digit percentage growth in 2007 in both core earnings per share and revenue, down from respective 23 percent and 18 percent gains in 2006. "They are acting conservatively," said Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Advisory Services Inc., which advises institutions, retirement plans and wealthy investors. "As long as they are willing to spend carefully, they should be able to accomplish their long-term goals." Moody's rivals include McGraw-Hill Cos.' MHP.N Standard & Poor's, Fimalac SA's ( LBCP.PA ) Fitch Ratings, A.M. Best Co. and Canada's Dominion Bond Rating Service. Moody's last quarter sold its 99 Church Street headquarters to developer Larry Silverstein for $170 million. The company is leasing the 11-story building until it takes over 15 floors at the nearby 7 World Trade Center. Berkshire owned 17.2 percent of Moody's as of September 30, roughly 2-1/2 times as much as any other investor, according to Thomson ShareWatch. Through Tuesday, Moody's shares had risen 17 percent in the last year, and nearly quadrupled over five years. (Additional reporting by Christopher Kaufman)
