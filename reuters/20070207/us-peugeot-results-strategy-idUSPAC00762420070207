 PARIS  (Reuters) - French carmaker PSA Peugeot Citroen ( PEUP.PA ) said on Wednesday it would detail a long-term strategy plan for up to 2010 in mid-May and would unveil its vision for the post-2010 period in September. 


 New Chief Executive Christian Streiff also said the company was looking at entering the U.S. market amid strategic options and was examining how far it could develop its current policy of co-operation and limited alliances with other car manufacturers.
