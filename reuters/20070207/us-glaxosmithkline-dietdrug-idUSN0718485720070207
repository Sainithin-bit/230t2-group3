 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline Plc won approval to sell an over-the-counter weight loss drug called Alli in the United States, the company and U.S. health officials said on Wednesday. 


 Alli was approved for use by overweight adults along with a reduced-calorie, low-fat diet and exercise, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said. The pill helps people lose weight by reducing the amount of fat the body absorbs. The undigested fat is eliminated through bowel movements, which can cause side effects, such as gas and oily discharge. Eating a low-fat diet reduces those effects, Glaxo and the FDA said. Alli will cost about $2 a day and be in stores by summer, Steven Burton, vice president for GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare's weight control division, said in an interview. The drug is a lower dose version of Roche AG's prescription diet drug Xenical, known generically as orlistat. News of the approval came after U.S. markets closed. Shares of London-based Glaxo closed down 21 cents at $55.35 on the New York Stock Exchange.
