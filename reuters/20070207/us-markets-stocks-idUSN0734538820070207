 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Nasdaq Composite Index booked its second straight day of gains on Wednesday as solid earnings from Cisco Systems Inc. ( CSCO.O ) increased the allure of technology stocks. 


 But falling oil prices curbed a broader market advance. Based on the latest available data, the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  inched up just 0.56 of a point, or 0.00 percent, for an unofficial finish at 12,666.77. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  gained 2.02 points, or 0.14 percent, to end unofficially at 1,450.02. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  shot up 19.01 points, or 0.77 percent, to close unofficially at 2,490.50.
