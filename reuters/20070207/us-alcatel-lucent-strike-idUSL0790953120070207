 PARIS  (Reuters) - Unions at Alcatel-Lucent ALU.PA called on Wednesday for a strike on February 15 to protest against a restructuring at the telecoms equipment provider, fearing more job cuts than announced. 


 Unions said management had dismissed as "fantasy" a report in the weekly l'Expansion on Tuesday which said there could be 15,000 to 20,000 jobs lost, many more than the 9,000 announced as part of the merger between the U.S. and French group. "Management has told us that this range was a fantasy," said Alain Hurstel, head of the European works council for Alcatel-Lucent and a member of the CFDT union. "If that were true, it would be a catastrophe for the group." However, Hurstel added: "We understand that there will be more than 9,000 jobs cut but certainly not in the range mentioned (in l'Expansion)." The two companies began operating as a combined unit on December 1, becoming the world's second-largest supplier of telecoms network and mobile equipment after Cisco Systems Inc. ( CSCO.O ). Alcatel-Lucent said last month that cost savings for 2007 would be 200 million euros ($259.8 million) higher than expected, which some analysts said could imply more jobs cuts than planned, perhaps another 2,000. "We have just announced an extra 200 million euros of savings for 2007 ... It is clear there will be more job cuts than planned, perhaps between 10,000 and 12,000, but the numbers mentioned (in l'Expansion) appear to be completely preposterous," an unnamed source at Alcatel-Lucent was quoted as saying in a report on Wednesday in the French daily Le Monde. Alcatel-Lucent declined to confirm the Le Monde report. The group is to publish full-year results on Friday on the back of its profit warning last month and is expected to be grilled by investors and analysts on the downsizing. "We will work together as of now and will call for people not to work on February 15," said Jean-Baptiste Triquet, a member of the CFDT union. Works councils, union representatives and management are due to meet on February 13, 14 and 16 to discuss the job cuts. Of the jobs to be shed, l'Expansion said 1,500 to 2,000 would be in France and quoted industrial and union sources saying 500 would be through early retirement. The stock was up 0.61 percent at 9.97 euros by 1334 GMT.
