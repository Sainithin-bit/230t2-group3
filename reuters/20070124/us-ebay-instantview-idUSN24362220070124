 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - EBay Inc.'s ( EBAY.O ) quarterly net profit rose 24 percent, topping expectations as its core auction business strengthened, and the company said 2007 earnings would be at the high end of analysts' forecasts. 

  COMMENTARY: FRANK HUSIC, MANAGING PARTNER AND CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER,  HUSIC CAPITAL MANAGEMENT IN SAN FRANCISCO: "So far it looks good, but it's become a complicated story because there's been a slowing of the core auction business. So we'll have to wait for the call and see how much has come from other parts of the business, which would change how people feel about the results. "Auctions are the base business. That's what the company is about. Competition was also part of the bear story, the growing competitive environment for auctions. People will want them to break it down by category. How much is coming from other places, acquisitions like Skype. "But on the surface, the earnings and revenue are very good numbers. They are way beyond expectations." SAFA RASHTCHY, ANALYST, PIPER JAFFRAY "The numbers are better than what we expected but there's so many parts. Paypal was good and people are excited but the real question is how well they did in auction and how they converted those auctions. There are so many components. This (stock move) might be a quick reaction rather than knowing if the upside has a quality that people are assuming.
