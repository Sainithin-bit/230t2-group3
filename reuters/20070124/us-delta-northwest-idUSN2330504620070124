 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bankrupt Delta Air Lines Inc. DALRQ.PK is not in merger talks with rival Northwest Airlines Corp. NWACQ.PK, Delta's Chief Executive Gerald Grinstein said in a newsletter to employees on Tuesday. 

 Grinstein's comments come after reports of a possible link up between the two bankrupt airlines and as Delta faces an unwanted $9.8 billion takeover bid from rival US Airways Group ( LCC.N ). "We are not in merger negotiations with Northwest," Grinstein was quoted as telling members of Delta Board Council, which represents about 40,000 employees. "At the behest of our creditors' committee we recently retained an investment banker to obtain information from Northwest, a far cry from negotiating for a merger with them." Grinstein added that he was not against consolidation in the industry, but called a potential deal with US Airways "the poster child of the worst kind of a merger." Atlanta-based Delta, which has been operating under Chapter 11 protection since September 2005, has said it intends to exit bankruptcy by spring this year as an independent carrier. US Airways, which first publicly offered to buy Delta in November last year, raised its bid earlier this month and has given Delta's creditors until February 1 to back its offer. Earlier on Tuesday, US Airways Chief Executive Doug Parker told Reuters that his company was confident about its offer and did not have any other merger partner in mind should its bid for Delta fail. Parker also said he thought reports about talks of a merger between Delta and Northwest were inaccurate.
