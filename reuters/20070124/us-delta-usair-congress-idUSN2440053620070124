 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The fight over US Airways' proposed $9.8 billion takeover of bankrupt Delta Air Lines Inc. DALRQ.PK moved on Wednesday to Capitol Hill, where lawmakers questioned the top executives of both companies about what the deal would mean for consumers. 

 US Airways Group Inc. ( LCC.N ) Chairman Doug Parker defended the proposed bid, telling the Senate Commerce Committee that lower costs and operational efficiencies would cut fares in "dozens of new markets" for passengers. "We have put forth a fair and equitable proposal ... to make the combination of Delta and US Airways into a stronger, more competitive carrier than either carrier can become on its own," Parker said at the hearing on airline industry consolidation. However, Delta's chief executive, Gerald Grinstein, said fares would not go down because the two airlines directly compete in many markets. "The major loser in this proposed takeover is small communities," Grinstein said. "All indications -- and all past evidence -- point to price increases for consumers should this merger go forward." Grinstein also said some 10,000 jobs would have to be cut for US Airways to achieve the gains it anticipates. The Delta chief opposes the takeover and wants Delta to exit bankruptcy this year as an independent carrier. Parker said there would be no furloughs of front-line employees at either airline under the merger and airports currently served by the two carriers would be served by the combined carrier. Democratic Sen. John Rockefeller of West Virginia raised the possibility of some form of federal regulation to protect service to small U.S. cities. "The industry is far too changed and far too global for us to return to a completely regulated environment, however I am becoming increasingly convinced that some regulation may become an option to make sure small communities are not harmed by consolidation," Rockefeller said. Rockefeller, who heads the Senate panel's subcommittee on aviation issues, did not elaborate. Congress cannot block an airline merger, but opposition from a number of lawmakers or a mix of key members could complicate a deal, according to industry experts. Also testifying was the Transportation Department's assistant secretary for aviation, Andrew Steinberg. Steinberg said fewer carriers would not necessarily be bad for consumers. "The challenge we face is to ensure that our regulatory regime does not stand in the way of marketplace forces that would otherwise result in new entry, business combinations, asset sales" or the disappearance of a carrier, he said. Steinberg refused to comment on his department's review of the proposed Delta acquisition or any other specific deal. The Consumer Federation of America criticized US Airways' takeover proposal. "The mergers that are being discussed among the major airlines are all about increasing market power by eliminating competition and restricting flights on thousands of routes that low cost carriers have not and will not serve," Mark Cooper, the federation's director of research, told lawmakers. Delta creditors have until February 1 to decide on the offer from US Airways. Since 2001, the airline industry has been hit with two dozen Chapter 11 bankruptcy filings, five liquidations, and $35 billion in cumulative losses, Parker said. However, US Airways had a profit, excluding special items, for the first three quarters of 2006 and is expected to report a profit in the fourth quarter next week. US Airways merged with America West in 2005.
