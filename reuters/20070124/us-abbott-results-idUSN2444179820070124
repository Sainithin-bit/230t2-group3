 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Abbott Laboratories Inc. ( ABT.N ) posted a big fourth-quarter loss on Wednesday due to a charge related to its $3.7 billion purchase of Kos Pharmaceuticals, offsetting sales growth of its medical devices and drugs. 

 The suburban Chicago-based company posted a net loss of $476.2 million, or 31 cents per share, compared with a profit of $976.4 million, or 63 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, including a charge of 82 cents per share from the Kos acquisition, Abbott earned 75 cents per share for the quarter. Analysts, on average, expected 74 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Abbott said sales rose 2.8 percent to $6.22 billion, slightly higher than the Reuters Estimates forecast. But sales rose 14.5 percent excluding revenues received in 2005 from three products it stopped co-promoting for German drug maker Boehringer Ingelheim in January 2006. Abbott had captured only a slight share of profits from the three products that it sold for years in partnership with Boehringer, including arthritis drug Mobic and Flomax for enlarged prostates. The company forecast 2007 earnings of $2.77 to $2.83 per share, in line with the Reuters Estimate of $2.78. The forecast includes the impact of Abbot's planned $8.1 billion sale of two diagnostics units to General Electric Co. ( GE.N ). Abbott projected sales growth this year of 13 to 15 percent. Sales of Abbott prescription drugs fell 8.2 percent in the fourth quarter to $3.54 billion, but rose 9.4 percent when excluding the year-earlier sales of Boehringer's products. Revenue from Humira, an injectible treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, soared 41 percent to $620 million, helped by its more-convenient dosing schedule than rival medicines. Abbott predicted it will fetch 2007 sales of more than $2.7 billion. Sales of Depakote, used to treat bipolar disorder and epilepsy, jumped 15 percent to $405 million. Sales of TriCor, used to lower blood fats called triglycerides, rose 4.3 percent to $326 million. But sales of antibiotic Biaxin and anesthetic Ultane both fell 16 percent, to $235 million and $195 million, respectively, hurt by cheaper generics. The company's line of diagnostics posted sales gains of 6.4 percent, to $1.05 billion, while revenue from nutritional products jumped 9.3 percent to $1.1 billion. The company reported sales of $389 million for vascular products, primarily those obtained from its purchase last April of Guidant Corp.'s vascular business -- including its Xience drug-coated stent used to prop open coronary arteries that have been cleared of plaque.
