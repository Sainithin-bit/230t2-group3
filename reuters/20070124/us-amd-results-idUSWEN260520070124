 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices Inc. ( AMD.N ) posted a surprise quarterly loss on Tuesday as a price war with Intel Corp. ( INTC.O ) took a heavier toll than expected. 

 Shares in the company fell more than 5 percent in after-hours trading. AMD also said its gross margin took a big hit in the fourth quarter due to falling prices for server processors, and it gave a revenue forecast for the first quarter that was short of Wall Street expectations. Costs related to its $5.4 billion purchase of graphics chip maker ATI also weighed on results. "The acquisition was an expensive proposition that took a toll on AMD's fourth-quarter numbers," said JoAnne Feeney, managing director of FTN Midwest Securities. "But one should not ignore the obvious increasing competition from Intel that lowered average selling prices and stopped AMD from gaining further share." AMD's net loss for the fourth quarter ended December 31 was $574 million, or $1.08 per share, compared with a profit of $96 million, or 21 cents a share, a year earlier. The results included special items such as a $550 million charge related to its purchase of ATI. After adjusting for those charges but including stock-based compensation, AMD lost 4 cents per share, while the average Wall Street forecast was for a profit of 8 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue fell to $1.77 billion from $1.84 billion a year earlier. The average analyst forecast was for revenue of $1.74 billion. AMD said its bottom line was hit due to a drop in server chip prices and the inclusion of ATI's less-profitable operations, which includes graphics chips and chipsets -- clusters of secondary chips that surround a main processor. Gross margin fell to 40 percent from 52 percent in the previous quarter and from 57 percent a year earlier. "Pricing is very, very challenging and we expect it to be for all of the year," Chief Executive Hector Ruiz told analysts on a conference call. Executives said they expected gross margin would improve in the first quarter over the fourth quarter due to increased use of new chipmaking equipment and as ATI became more integrated into its new parent. "We believe gross margin will actually improve quarter on quarter, especially in the microprocessor business and also in the ATI business as well," Chief Operating officer Derrick Meyer said. He declined to say how much of an improvement he expected. The Sunnyvale, California-based company said it expected first-quarter revenue of between $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion, shy of the $1.8 billion expected by analysts. "I suspect AMD is anticipating both a seasonal decline in unit sales and continued fierce competition with Intel that will pressure (prices)," Feeney said. Doug Freedman, an analyst with American Technology Research, said the latest margin number was hard to square with AMD's forecast made just last month that margins in 2007 would be about 50 percent. "Their credibility is nothing right now, in what they've told us as analysts," Freedman said, adding that he had been hoping to hear executives outline a fresh strategy to restore profitability. AMD, the No. 2 maker of PC processors behind Intel, said earlier this month that fourth quarter revenue would fall short of Wall Street expectations and operating profit would fall from the third quarter, citing lower prices for its chips. Shares in AMD have fallen more than 50 percent over the past year as investors grow concerned that its market share gains against Intel have stalled. The stock trades at 13 times expected 2008 profit, compared to 15.6 times for Intel. Shares in AMD fell as much as 5.3 percent in extended trading to $16.58 after the results were announced.
