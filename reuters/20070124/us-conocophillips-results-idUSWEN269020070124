 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips ( COP.N ), the No. 3 U.S. oil company, said on Wednesday fourth-quarter earnings fell 13 percent on lower natural gas prices and shrinking gasoline margins, but beat recently reduced Wall Street expectations. 

 The company also said it expects its oil and gas production to drop in the first quarter from fourth quarter levels. Net income in the quarter fell to $3.20 billion, or $1.91 a share, from $3.68 billion, or $2.61 a share, in 2005. The drop in profit -- the first since late 2002 -- came as U.S. oil prices retreated from a more-than-four-year bull market. "Earnings have peaked, at least temporarily, unless commodity prices rebound to higher levels," said Howard Weil analyst Gene Gillespie. Excluding about 17 cents per share in charges, the company earned about $2.08 a share. On that basis, the average forecast of analysts polled by Reuters Estimates was $1.99 a share. But analysts had been expecting earnings of around $2.18 a share before lowering their estimates after the company announced weaker-than-projected production for the quarter. "I think the Street was too bearish on the downstream operations," said Mercantile Trust energy analyst Gene Pisasale, using the industry term to refer to the company's refining and marketing operations. "If you look at the numbers, year-over-year the Street was expecting them to be down 27 percent, and margins weren't down nearly that much," he said. Revenue in the quarter fell to $41.5 billion from $51.3 billion in the year-earlier quarter. Houston-based ConocoPhillips said it produced 2.49 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in the quarter, including about 440,000 boepd from its stake in Russia's Lukoil  LMOH.MM. The price the company received for its crude oil in the quarter was $55.10, up from $53.05 in the year-earlier quarter. Its average natural gas price fell to $6.12 per thousand cubic feet, down from $7.94 per thousand cubic feet in 2005. It said it expects first-quarter production to slip, hurt by downtime in the North Sea, OPEC production quota reductions in Venezuela and Libya, and other factors. The company said that the currently announced quotas, if carried through until the end of the quarter, would cut first-quarter production by about 30,000 boepd. REFINING MARGINS TIGHTEN ConocoPhillips said its refineries operated at about 94 percent of capacity in the quarter. It expects its refineries to also run in the mid-90 percent range in the first quarter. The company said its refining margins in the United States fell to $11.39 per barrel from $12.71 per barrel in 2005. International refining margins fell to $6.22 per barrel in the quarter from $8.95 per barrel in the year-earlier period. In December, ConocoPhillips said it expects 2007 capital spending to drop about 25 percent from 2006 as it pulls back on some investments due to rising costs. It finished buying its 20 percent stake in Lukoil in 2006, which also contributed to the gap between budgets. "We want to make sure that we slow down, we really take a good hard look to make sure that we don't try to accelerate projects, that we execute them with a lot of consciousness and good prudence in terms of making sure that we get value for our investments," Chief Executive James Mulva said on a conference call with investors. He said he does not expect the company to approve a conversion project at its Wilhelmshaven, Germany, refinery in 2007 as rising maintenance costs have forced it to delay that work, probably until at least 2008. Mulva also that the company would spend a higher proportion of cash on dividend payments and share repurchases in 2007 than last year. It has already said it plans to buy back up to $1 billion of its stock, including about $750 million of repurchases in the first quarter. U.S. oil prices fell sharply toward the end of the third quarter and spent much of the fourth quarter hovering around $60 a barrel, roughly in line with year-earlier prices. U.S. crude has again dropped sharply in the first quarter, trading at around $55 a barrel. Shares of ConocoPhillips were up 57 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $65.54 in late afternoon trading versus a slight rise in the Chicago Board Options Exchange's oil index. Since the end of the third quarter, ConocoPhillips shares are up about 10 percent, outperforming the CBOE oil index, which rose about 8 percent in the same period.
