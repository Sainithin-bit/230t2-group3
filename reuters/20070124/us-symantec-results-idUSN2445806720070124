 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Security software maker Symantec Corp. ( SYMC.O ) posted a 25 percent increase in quarterly profit on Wednesday, and said it planned to cut costs by $200 million. 

 Net income rose to $113.7 million, or 12 cents per share, for its third quarter ended December 31, from $90.7 million, or 8 cents, a year ago. Revenue rose to $1.31 billion from $1.15 billion. On January 16, Symantec said it expected a profit of 10 cents to 11 cents per share on revenue of $1.29 billion to $1.31 billion. It cited weak business software sales and higher-than-expected costs. Symantec also announced a $1 billion stock buyback program. It has completed a $1 billion stock buyback plan announced in January 2006. Cupertino, California-based Symantec plans to cut costs by $200 million by cutting some jobs, reducing new hires, decreasing contractor and consulting spending, lowering spending on travel, and consolidating facilities. "The biggest thing is they announced the cost-cutting initiative, which the Street was hoping for," said FBR analyst Daniel Ives. "Symantec right now is in a conundrum. They're in a lower revenue trajectory, and they need to curtail expenses, which they're starting to do." Excluding items, profit was 26 cents, topping the average analyst estimate of 25 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. "With a disappointing quarter behind us, we are moving to better align our costs with our new revenue expectations," said Symantec Chief Executive John Thompson in a statement. "I am confident that we have the right strategy in place; however, we must sharpen our execution." Symantec also reaffirmed its forecast for its March quarter. "The company is generally heading in the right direction strategically, but execution is the issue," analyst Ives said. Before they issued the warning earlier this month, Symantec had forecast a profit of 14 cents to 15 cents per share on revenue of $1.32 billion to $1.35 billion. Shares of Symantec rose in extended trade to $17.55. In regular trade, the stock was up 7 cents to close at $17.48 on Nasdaq.
