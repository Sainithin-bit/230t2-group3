 TAIPEI  (Reuters) - U.S. buyout firm Newbridge Capital is to pay $100 million for control of Taiwan's Union Insurance Co. Ltd., part of the troubled Rebar Asia Pacific Group, Union Insurance said. 

 In exchange for the investment, Union will give Newbridge new stock accounting for at least 50 percent of its share capital, a Union Insurance official told Reuters on Wednesday. Union would use the money to boost its capital, and Newbridge would become its controlling shareholder after the deal, the Taiwan insurer said in a statement. "We would like to complete the deal as soon as possible and will take a conservative approach to reviewing our financial status," the Union official said. Union Insurance shares closed up their daily limit of 6.9 percent after the deal was announced. Private equity funds have been flocking to Taiwan and the rest of Asia in recent years, attracted by the region's growth and values. These investors tend to buy troubled firms at low prices, restructure and exit with a big profit years later. Newbridge, the regional investment arm of Texas Pacific Group, last year made its presence known in Taiwan's financial sector, which has suffered from a consumer credit crunch and overcrowding, paying T$27 billion for a stake in Taishin Financial "The strategy adopted by Newbridge has been buying a company's stake at a bargain, and then generating handsome returns a few years later. That's what we're seeing in Union's case," said Bentham Hung, a vice president of Fuh Hwa Securities Investment Trust, which has $4.55 billion under management. "Most financial stocks, Union included, appeal to buyout firms as they are cheaper than regional rivals," he said. Taiwan's financial shares trade at an average of about 1.5 times price-to-book, against 4 times for some Chinese counterparts, he added. Newbridge executives were not immediately available for comment. The companies have signed a memorandum of understanding and Newbridge will complete due diligence before Union Insurance announces its annual results later this year. Investors have been worried about Union Insurance since two of its sister companies, Chia Hsin and China Rebar, said they were reorganising after losing money for several years. All three firms are units of the financially struggling Rebar Asia Pacific Group, whose founder Wang You-theng is wanted in Taiwan and has reportedly fled to the United States. Earlier this month, Fitch Ratings downgraded Union Insurance's national insurer financial strength after it announced write-offs related to four Rebar companies. Before Wednesday's rally, Union shares had fallen about 40 percent so far this year. (Additional reporting by  Doug Young )
