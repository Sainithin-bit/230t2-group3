 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Online marketplace eBay Inc.'s ( EBAY.O ) quarterly net profit rose 24 percent on strong international revenue growth, and the company said 2007 earnings would be at the high end of analysts' forecasts. 

 Shares rose more than 12 percent in after hours trading, and investors took eBay's results as a sign of strength in its main auction business and its forecasts as a good sign for revenue growth. "EBay is at the early stages of a multi-quarter period of stabilizing-to-accelerating growth," Goldman Sachs analyst Anthony Noto wrote in a research note. "We expect eBay shares to benefit from strong results, higher estimates and likely multiple expansion given accelerating gross merchandise volume growth and improved margins," he wrote. EBay's fourth-quarter net income rose to $346.5 million, or 25 cents a share, from the year-earlier quarter's net income of $279.2 million, or 20 cents a diluted share. Excluding one-time items, net income rose 27 percent to $431 million, or 31 cents per share, topping Wall Street's consensus forecast by 3 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Gross merchandise volume (GMV), the total value of goods and services sold on eBay auction sites, grew 20 percent to $14.4 billion. GMV grew 17 percent, year-over-year, in the third quarter of 2006. Net revenue rose 29 percent to $1.72 billion from a year earlier, representing a steadying of eBay's growth rate, which had declined in recent years from levels around 50 percent. Analysts forecast revenue, on average, of $1.67 billion, a growth rate of about 25 percent, according to Reuters Estimates. Forecasts ranged between $1.63 billion and $1.71 billion. "(From) third quarter to fourth quarter we saw a reacceleration of growth driven by better-quality inventories and higher conversion rates," Chief Financial Officer Bob Swan said in an interview, referring to efforts to woo more buyers and sellers. U.S. auction activity was driven by demand for hot products during the holiday season, specifically the Sony Corp. ( 6758.T ) PlayStation 3 and the Nintendo Co. Ltd. 7974.OS Wii. Growth was also strong in Germany and Britain, eBay's second- and third-largest auction markets, respectively. International revenues, which account for nearly half of all sales, grew 40 percent year-to-year, continuing a four-quarter growth rate acceleration, up from 35 percent in early 2006. Skype, the Web-based telephone-calling company it acquired in late 2005, had signed up 171 million registered users by the end of 2006, up from 136 million three months earlier. Fourth-quarter revenue grew 164 percent to $66 million. "We had a really good core business quarter," eBay President and Chief Executive Meg Whitman said in an interview, referring to the company's online auctions. EBay said it expected first-quarter net revenue of $1.67 billion to $1.72 billion, in the middle of current estimates. The company expects first-quarter diluted earnings per share, excluding one-time items, in a range of 28 cents to 30 cents, also in line with a Reuters Estimates survey. For the 2007 year, eBay said it expected revenue from $7.05 billion to $7.30 billion, in line with expectations. Full-year 2007 earnings, excluding one-time items, are expected at $1.25 to $1.29 per share, the company said. That's slightly above the current consensus of $1.24 a share and in the upper half of current forecasts ranging from $1.19 to  $1.32. The shares surged more than 12 percent to $33.70 in extended trade after the results on Wednesday, adding to a 4.8 percent rise in the Nasdaq regular session ahead of the news.
