 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Xerox Corp. ( XRX.N ) posted better-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday, but anemic revenue growth disappointed investors, who drove down the stock as much as 3.5 percent. 

 Xerox, the world's largest provider of office printers, copiers and related services, said fourth-quarter revenue totaled $4.38 billion, a 3 percent increase and the result of a weak dollar. Equipment sales fell 1 percent. Standard & Poor's analyst Richard Stice said solid operational profit without revenue gains may have left investors impressed with Xerox's performance, but not thrilled about its prospects. "There is not a lot to get excited about," he said. "It really remains largely a cost-cutting story. You have to wonder how much cost you can wring out of the business without growing your revenue base." The company, whose growth is driven by high-end printing and document-management services, said net income fell 24 percent to $214 million, or 22 cents a share, from $282 million, or 27 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding restructuring costs related to job cuts and plant closings, profit was 38 cents a share, a penny better than the average expectation of analysts polled by Reuters Estimates. "The one knock on the quarter was equipment revenue growth which was down ... 4 percent year on year on a constant currency basis," said Cross Research analyst Shannon Cross. "Beyond currency, it was a very strong quarter from an operational standpoint." Over the past three years, Xerox -- whose rivals range from Canon Inc. ( 7751.T ) to Heidelberg ( HDDG.DE ) -- has grabbed market share with new digital office printers and large-scale presses. But it still struggles to boost equipment revenue due to strong competition and pricing pressure on color laser printer sales to some distributors. Xerox shares, which have risen about 15 percent in the past 12 months, fell to a session low of $16.12 after the results were released. In afternoon trade, the stock was off 12 cents to $16.58 on the New York Stock Exchange. INVESTORS NOT EXCITED Xerox said it is making progress on planting the seeds of long-term revenue growth as its expands sales of color printers and high-end systems, which are routinely combined with lucrative long-term supplies and service contracts, also referred to as post-sale revenue. "Our business model is all about annuity, and ... the kinds of color boxes we put in the marketplace all is going to drive post-sale," Xerox Chief Financial Officer Larry Zimmerman told Reuters. "Eventually, on a constant currency basis you are going to see 3 and 4 percent total growth." Post-sale revenue rose 5 percent. Revenue from color products rose 13 percent. Xerox said gross margins were 41.1 percent, about flat compared with the fourth quarter of 2005. "Their (equipment) installs were solid in the areas where they want to focus, so it's going to lead to a stronger installed base, which is what you want in a razor/razor blade model," said Cross, referring to its losses on equipment sales, but profit on related services. Looking ahead, Xerox sees first-quarter earnings in a range of 21 cents to 23 cents a share. Analysts expected profit of 22 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Xerox also expects its introduction of new products in 2007 to be more than double the total in 2006.
