 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Dow Jones & Co Inc DJ.N awarded its chief executive a bonus of nearly $900,000 in shares, and awarded the publisher of The Wall Street Journal a bonus of nearly $500,000 in shares, the company disclosed. 

 Chief Executive Rich Zannino got the rights to 22,788 shares, worth $892,834, in 2006, Dow Jones said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday. Dow Jones awarded Journal publisher Gordon Crovitz 12,694 shares worth $497,351. Former Journal publisher Karen Elliott House received shares worth $458,523. Journal Managing Editor Paul Steiger received shares worth $322,177. Dow Jones said earlier this month it would cut dozens of jobs in its enterprise media group. It also said it would cut more costs with a redesign of the Journal, including the debut this month of a narrower paper. The Journal also cut several jobs as part of its decision to shut down its Canadian operation, though Steiger has told Reuters the paper plans no more foreign bureau closings.
