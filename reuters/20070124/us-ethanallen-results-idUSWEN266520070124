 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Furniture maker and retailer Ethan Allen Interiors Inc. ( ETH.N ) said on Wednesday that quarterly profit fell 13 percent amid an industrywide sales slowdown. 

 The home furnishings retail environment "as a whole, remains uncertain," Chairman and Chief Executive Farooq Kathwari said in a statement. Still, Ethan Allen believes the average analysts' forecast for earnings in the current quarter "is within reach," he said. Earnings for the fiscal second quarter ended December 31 came to $22.8 million, or 70 cents a share, compared with $26.2 million, or 77 cents a share, a year earlier. The earnings matched analysts' average forecast, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales fell 6.7 percent to $257.4 million, falling short of analysts' average revenue expectation of $270.7 million. Furniture companies have been pressured as cooling home sales led some consumers to cut back on big-ticket purchases. In December, Stanley Furniture Co. ( STLY.O ) said it would cut about 200 jobs at a North Carolina plant in response to the industry sales slowdown. And Furniture Brands International Inc. FBN.N, maker of Thomasville, Lane and Broyhill, forecast a fourth-quarter loss compared with previous expectations for a profit, citing lower sales. Ethan Allen, based in Danbury, Connecticut, had posted a 51 percent drop in first quarter profit last October and said retail conditions were "difficult." In December, the company saw positive trends in written sales compared to a year earlier, Kathwari said. Analysts, on average, expect the company to earn 61 cents per share in the current fiscal third quarter.
