 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A New Jersey state court has rejected Citigroup Inc.'s bid to dismiss a $10 billion lawsuit charging that it helped former management at Italian food company Parmalat SpA commit fraud. 

 In his decision on Monday, Bergen County Superior Court Judge Jonathan Harris rejected Citigroup's argument that Parmalat, best known for its long-life milk, brought the case in the wrong court. Parmalat Chief Executive Enrico Bondi has accused some 50 defendants of helping prior management hide debt and inflate results, leading to Europe's largest bankruptcy case in 2003. Harris wrote it was "reasonable" for Parmalat to sue Citigroup in New Jersey, "although the urbane land of Dante Alighieri, Michelangelo Buonarroti, and Leonardo Da Vinci might better suit defendants' liking than the straightforward home of Yogi Berra, Anthony Soprano, and Frank Sinatra." A Parmalat unit, Farmland Dairies, had been located in Wallington, New Jersey. Citigroup had argued that New Jersey wasn't equipped to deal with the case's complexity, didn't have key witnesses and documents, and should not be forced to interpret Italian law. A state appeals court last July had called Citigroup's arguments "compelling," but sent the case back to the trial court because Citigroup filed its dismissal motion too soon. Citigroup spokesman Daniel Noonan said the bank was disappointed with Harris' 22-page decision, "although it deals solely with the issue of where this case should be heard, and not whether the unfounded allegations against Citigroup have any merit." The bank has not decided whether to appeal, he said. Bondi has obtained more than $700 million in settlements from Parmalat litigation in the United States and Italy. Parmalat sued Citigroup, Bank of America Corp. and accounting firms Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu and Grant Thornton International for $10 billion each. The other defendants' cases have been handled in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. Deloitte settled this month for $149 million. Parmalat relisted in Milan in 2005 after a restructuring.
