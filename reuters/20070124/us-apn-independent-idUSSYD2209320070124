 WELLINGTON  (Reuters) - Australasian media group APN News and Media ( APN.AX ) said on Thursday it had received an offer of $A6.05 a share from Independent News and Media Plc INWS.I and a private equity consortium. 

 The offer from the consortium of Independent, Providence Equity and The Carlyle Group, values APN's ordinary shares at A$2.78 billion ($2.2 billion). Irish-based Independent News already owns 40 percent of APN, which is listed on the Australian and New Zealand stock exchanges. Previous talks between the two companies ended in November, after Independent News failed to make an offer. Shares in APN closed on Wednesday at A$6.10, having traded between A$4.43 and A$6.20 over the past 12 months. Ted Harris, chairman of the independent committee of the APN Board, said in a statement "the proposal will now be considered by the committee, which will decide whether it is in the best interests of all shareholders, and make a recommendation as quickly as possible." APN is the largest radio broadcaster in Australasia and publishes a range of newspapers and magazines, including New Zealand's biggest daily newspaper, The New Zealand Herald. Independent News publishes 175 newspaper and magazine titles across the globe, including The Independent in the United Kingdom. Private equity firms are scouring Australia for media assets ahead of a new law taking effect this year easing foreign ownership caps and allowing owners of one platform -- TV, radio or newspapers -- to own another platform in the same market.
