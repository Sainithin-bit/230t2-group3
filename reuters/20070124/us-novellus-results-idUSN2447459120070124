 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Novellus Systems Inc. NVLS.O, a maker of semiconductor manufacturing equipment, posted sharply higher earnings on Wednesday, but forecast first-quarter revenue below expectations. 

 Fourth-quarter net income climbed 85 percent to $42.6 million, or 34 cents per share, from $23 million, or 17 cents per share, a year earlier. Net sales advanced to $438.5 million from $332.3 million. Excluding a $46.1 million tax charge, profit was $79 million, or 63 cents per share. Analysts, on average, expected earnings of 56 cents before items on revenue of $436.1 million, according to Reuters Estimates. Bookings fell from the third quarter to $441.6 million. Shipments declined 5.8 percent to $390.2 million. The gross profit margin rose to 51.4 percent from 42.3 percent a year earlier. Novellus shares, up 37 percent since hitting a year low in May, rose 1.6 percent to $31.10 in extended-hours trading. The stock closed up 1.9 percent at $30.61 on Nasdaq, giving Novellus a market value of about $3.78 billion. Chief Financial Officer William Kurtz told analysts on a conference call that Novellus sees first-quarter earnings of 41 cents to 44 cents per share before restructuring costs. Excluding stock-based compensation, Kurtz forecast earnings at 44 cents to 47 cents. The company forecast first-quarter revenue of $395 million to $405 million. Kurtz said a reorganization of the company's business structure will delay recognition of about $10 million in revenue to the second quarter from the first period. Analysts, on average, expected first-quarter earnings of 49 cents per share before certain items, and revenue of $418.7 million, according to Reuters Estimates.
