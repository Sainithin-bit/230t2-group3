 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Home Depot Inc. ( HD.N ), under fire by critics who charged that it overpaid former Chief Executive Robert Nardelli, on Wednesday said the 2007 compensation package of its new CEO was valued at $8.9 million, with 89 percent of that at risk based on company performance. 

 The home improvement retailer said it reached agreement with Frank Blake, who succeeded Nardelli as chairman and CEO earlier this month, on terms of his pay on January 23. Blake's annual base salary is $975,000, and his compensation pact does not include a guaranteed bonus or severance benefits, Home Depot said. The $8.9 million includes the base salary; bonus target of $1,950,000; $2.5 million in performance shares based on the company's shareholder return compared with the S&P 500 over a three-year period; $2.5 million in stock options that will only vest if the share price rises 25 percent from the grant date; and $975,000 in long-term incentive pay contingent on per-share profit meeting three-year performance goals. "After being criticized broadly for Nardelli's comp package, we believe the board had to align compensation to returns to earn shareholder respect," Goldman Sachs analyst Matthew Fassler said in a research note. Nardelli, who left the retailer by mutual agreement with the board on January 2, had been assailed by shareholders and others who charged his pay was not in line with Home Depot's stock performance. Nardelli earned at least $119,2 million in salary and bonus during his six years at Home Depot and was entitled to severance of $210 million under terms of his employment pact. Shareholders on January 10 asked a Georgia state court to issue a temporary restraining order on the severance pay. A judge in Atlanta earlier this week declined to do that, but gave plaintiffs two months to depose certain directors and gather information in the case. Home Depot's shares were up 24 cents to $40.67 on the New York Stock Exchange.
