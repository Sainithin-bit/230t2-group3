 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Broadcom Corp. ( BRCM.O ) said on Tuesday it recorded $2.22 billion in extra charges to correct accounting errors in its past stock options awards, the largest restatement to date in a U.S. options scandal. 

 The wireless equipment maker also said its former chief executive Henry Nicholas "bears significant responsibility for the lack of adequate controls in the option granting process due to the tone and style of doing business he set." Nicholas "did not personally benefit from any of the restated grants," Broadcom also noted. Former Chief Financial Officer William Ruehle and former human resources Vice President Nancy Tullos also bear responsibility for the lack of controls in the options granting process, Broadcom said in a filing. The company's statements came in a series of filings it made with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Broadcom said the charges were added to its 1998 to 2005 results, and the move will have no material impact on Broadcom's current cash and financial position. The accounting measurement dates for most of the options granted between June 1998 and May 2003 differed from the actual measurement dates, Broadcom said. Broadcom's co-founder Henry Samueli did not receive backdated options, the company said. Alan Ross and Scott McGregor, the chief executives who succeeded Nicholas, also did not receive backdated options, the company said. Broadcom is one of more than 160 U.S. companies that are investigating their options practices, with the Securities and Exchange Commission and federal prosecutors looking into many firms to see if they broke any accounting or criminal laws. The focus is on options that were backdated to increase their value to recipients, including senior company officers. Several executives have left or been dismissed from their companies in the wake of internal options investigations, including former Monster Worldwide Inc. ( MNST.O ) founder and chief executive Andrew McKelvey. Comverse Technology Inc.'s CMVT.O former finance chief in October became the first executive to plead guilty in the stock options investigation. Until Broadcom's restatement, the largest restatement so far had come from UnitedHealth Group Inc. ( UNH.N ), which forecast in December charges of up to $1.7 billion. Of the shares included in the backdated options grants, 95.8 percent went to non-executive employees, and 4.2 percent to executive officers, Broadcom said.
