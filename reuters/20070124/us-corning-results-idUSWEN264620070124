 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Corning Inc. ( GLW.N ) posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday, driven by sales of specialty glass for flat-screen televisions, sending its stock up more than 11 percent. 

 The company, which makes glass for flat display panels and fiber-optic cables, also forecast more strength in its display business in 2007, although its estimates for first quarter revenue and earnings were lighter than average Wall Street expectations. Investors appeared to be more impressed with the confidence of Corning executives in keeping profit margins stable by guarding against severe price declines, Maxim Group analyst Darice Liu said. She noted prices fell more than 16 percent last year and many were worried that trend would continue. "In 2006, Corning got hit hard by pricing declines," Liu said. "The focus (today) is on pricing strategy being deployed and implemented, as evidenced by first quarter pricing decline guidance of 1-2 percent, versus the past four quarters of 4-5 percent." Corning reported a net profit of $646 million, or 41 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, compared with a net loss of $33 million, or 2 cents per share, a year ago when it was hit by a big tax-related charge. Excluding special items, such as a $139 million gain related to litigation, profit was $488 million, or 31 cents per share. That exceeded Corning's own expectations and the average analyst forecast of 28 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 14 percent to $1.37 billion, topping the average analyst forecast of $1.30 billion. Key to Corning's optimism is its ability to hold down costs, despite the price declines. The company, which said margins in 2006 were 44 percent and will be about the same in 2007, declined to detail its pricing and cost management plan ahead of an investors meeting on February 9. "We anticipate that we should be able to continue our strong cost performance and then, if our pricing strategy works, we would expect price declines to be less severe this year," Corning Chief Financial Officer Jim Flaws said on a conference call. TVS DRIVE GROWTH The company, named after Corning, New York, where it began more than 150 years ago, has benefited from growing demand for liquid crystal displays in flat-panel televisions and computer monitors. Prices for large, slim TVs continue to fall, driving up consumer demand and sales. "LCD television is clearly becoming the largest driver of the increase in growth," Kate Asbeck, vice president of finance, told Reuters, adding LCD television penetration reached 22 percent of the world market in 2006 and may rise to 33 percent in 2007. Corning's total LCD glass volume increased 46 percent from a year ago, with profits from its display technologies segment up 25 percent. Sales in the telecommunications segment fell 11 percent to $404 million from $456 million in the third quarter. The company said the decline was less than it expected due to strong demand from European and North American phone companies. Looking ahead, Corning sees first quarter earnings of 24 cents to 27 cents per share, before one-time items, with revenue at $1.26 billion to $1.31 billion. Analysts were expecting a profit of 28 cents on revenue of $1.34 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Corning saw significant growth in its heavy-duty diesel products -- including filters for large truck engines -- due to new U.S. emissions regulations. The company added that its cash flow is so strong it may this year consider buying back its own stock or offering a dividend. Corning shares rose 11.15 percent, or $2.1, to $20.94 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Before today's news, the stock had fallen about 20 percent over the past 12 months. That compared with a drop of only 4 percent by Japan's Asahi Glass Co. Ltd. ( 5201.T ), its nearest competitor.
