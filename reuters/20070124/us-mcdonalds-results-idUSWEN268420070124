 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - McDonald's Corp. ( MCD.N ), the world's largest restaurant company, on Wednesday said quarterly net earnings nearly doubled after a large gain for last year's spinoff of the Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. ( CMG.N ) chain. 

 The hamburger chain also said it would open 800 restaurants in 2007 -- an increase from recent years in which the company scaled back expansion to focus on revitalizing sales at existing restaurants. Nearly half of the new restaurants will be in Asia, mainly in China and Japan, though 200 will be added in the United States and 150 will be opened in Europe, Chief Executive Jim Skinner said on a conference call with analysts. McDonald's plans to spend $1.9 billion on both the new locations and rebuilding and remodeling existing outlets. "McDonald's does need to invest in the future, particularly in places like China," said Janna Sampson, director of portfolio management at Oakbrook Investments in Lisle, Illinois. "We do need to see capital investment there for them to gain a foothold in those areas." Oakbrook Investments owns about 520,000 McDonald's shares. McDonald's spokeswoman Lisa Howard said net restaurant openings, which factors in locations that will be closed, would be just 400 in 2007, about the same as 2006. Fourth-quarter net income was $1.24 billion, or $1 per share, compared with $608.5 million, or 48 cents a share, a year before. Excluding the Chipotle gain, McDonald's earned 61 cents a share, matching a better-than-expected estimate the company gave last week. Sales rose 11 percent to $5.63 billion, while sales at hamburger restaurants open at least 13 months, a key retail measure known as same-store sales, rose 6.3 percent. McDonald's said last week that sales were boosted by customer demand for both the new chicken Snack Wrap and breakfast offerings in the United States and a Monopoly game promotion in Germany. In general, analysts expect McDonald's same-store sales increases to moderate this year due to stiff comparisons against strong results in the previous few years. To spur sales growth, Skinner said the company is testing a number of new menu items, including specialty coffees, premium hamburgers and breakfast burritos. Carl Sibilski of hedge fund Oyster Capital Management said rebuilding and remodeling existing U.S. restaurants should also be a boon to sales. "Those stores tend to do very well after they've been reconstructed, and management's decision to continue that program is indicative of a successful sales increase likely in the future," Sibilski said. McDonald's, based in Oak Brook, Illinois, has been on a hot streak since implementing an aggressive turnaround strategy in 2003 that included adding higher-priced menu items such as salads and chicken sandwiches, extending restaurant hours, and allowing customers to pay for meals with credit cards. The company's turnaround plan also included scaling back its rapid expansion and shedding smaller brands like Chipotle so it could focus on its flagship burger restaurants. Earlier this month, the chain said it was now exploring strategic options for its Boston Market chicken chain. McDonald's is also selling more of its company-owned restaurants to franchisees and has a long-term goal of owning less than 30 percent of its restaurants in a given market. The UK and Canada are two markets where McDonald's is seeking to reduce its restaurant ownership, said Chief Financial Officer Matthew Paull. Shares of McDonald's were down 58 cents, or 1.3 percent, at $44.27 Wednesday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange. (Additional reporting by  Brad Dorfman  and  Jessica Wohl  in Chicago)
