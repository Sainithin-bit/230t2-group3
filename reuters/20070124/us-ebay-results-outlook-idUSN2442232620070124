 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - EBay Inc. ( EBAY.O ) Chief Executive Meg Whitman said on Wednesday the company ended 2006 on a strong note but cautioned that making money off of its Skype acquisition was taking longer than hoped. 

 "We started off the year at a very strong pace, encountered a few hurdles in the middle of the year that we worked to overcome, and then ended the year on a high note," Whitman said. "In summary, fourth quarter was a very strong quarter."
