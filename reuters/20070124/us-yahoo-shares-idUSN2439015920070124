 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares Yahoo Inc. rose 7 percent on Wednesday as investors bet that an early debut of a new search advertising system would help the Internet media company capture faster revenue growth in 2007. 

 Yahoo said late on Tuesday its new system for selling Web ads, dubbed Panama, would be fully introduced in the United States as of February 5, about a month earlier than expected by Wall Street analysts. The technology is seen as a key test of Yahoo's ability to gain ground on Web search leader Google Inc. , even as its rival is still expected to grow faster in the coming year. "Yahoo remains a growth acceleration story," said Merrill Lynch analyst Justin Post in a research note. "We remain positive on Panama." He rates the share a "buy" and raised its price target to $33 from $32. Yahoo executives said during a conference call to discuss fourth-quarter results that the move of its advertising clients to the new system was progressing faster than it expected. Panama's ability to draw more advertising dollars from clients should help accelerate growth beginning in the second half of the year, they said. That view helped investors brush aside concerns over Yahoo's first-quarter and full year revenue forecasts, which fell short of previous analysts' estimates. "We view (fourth-quarter) results as a starting point for more positive sentiment on the stock, with expectations reset and the negative impact of a weaker affiliate network outlook incorporated into Yahoo's guidance," Post said. Some analysts took a more cautious view, noting that the move to Panama could incur some short-term costs if advertisers pull back on spending as they learn to use the new system. Yahoo also faces a potential drop in prices for its key branded advertising sales, where competition has grown with the explosion of social network sites like News Corp.'s MySpace.com and Google's YouTube. Citing such factors, Goldman Sachs cut its rating on Yahoo to "neutral" from "buy," with a $31.50 price target. "We do not see estimates going higher in the near term given the uncertainty of advertiser behavior as the Panama marketplace launches in addition to the shift from high CPM display inventory to low CPM display inventory," Goldman Sachs analyst Anthony Noto wrote in a research note. Yahoo shares rose $1.70 to $28.66 on the Nasdaq after rising as high as $28.93. Google gained 2.7 percent to $492.15.
