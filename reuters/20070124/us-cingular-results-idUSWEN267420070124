 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Cingular Wireless, the mobile service provider with the largest U.S. customer base, said on Wednesday its fourth-quarter profit nearly quadrupled as customer growth trumped Wall Street estimates. 

 The news sent parent AT&T Inc.'s ( T.N ) shares up 3.8 percent to $36.70, their highest level in almost five years, on the New York Stock Exchange. Analysts said Cingular likely took market share from Sprint Nextel Corp. ( S.N ), the No. 3 mobile phone service provider. "It's impressive they were able to deliver on the profit side despite growing much faster than expected," said Roe Equity Research analyst Kevin Roe. Cingular said profit rose to $782 million from $204 million a year ago. Service revenue rose 13 percent to $8.8 billion. Executives said during an analyst call that service revenue would grow in the low double-digit percentage range in 2007. Cingular added 2.4 million net new customers in the fourth quarter, beating the average estimate of 1.62 million from 10 analysts contacted by Reuters. It ended the quarter with 61 million subscribers. Chief Financial Officer Pete Ritcher attributed the strong customer growth partly to holiday shopping trends and said Cingular's revenue was boosted by data services like texting. The company - being rebranded as AT&T, which took full control of Cingular by buying BellSouth Corp. last month - said this would be the last quarter it reports separately from its parent. AT&T is scheduled to report its results on Thursday. PREPAID STILL WORRIES SOME In January, Apple Inc. ( AAPL.O ) said it would market the hotly anticipated iPhone, which combines wireless services with iPod-like entertainment, on Cingular's network as part of a multi-year exclusive deal. Some analysts see that helping to boost Cingular's appeal in the high-end wireless market. Others were still concerned Cingular's future profit would be hurt by a high dependence on less profitable customers who pay for calls in advance. Prepaid customers accounted for 746,00 of its direct customer additions. "I thought the net adds were certainly strong but there was a lot of prepaid ... the mix of subscriber additions is a little worrisome," said Stifel Nicolaus analyst Chris King. CFO Ritcher argued that going after the prepaid market did not hurt growth in postpaid customers, who pay monthly bills. Cingular likely took market share from prepaid providers such as Virgin Mobile USA, a venture of Sprint and Richard Branson's Virgin VA.UL that targets the fast growing youth segment, Ritcher said. As postpaid growth nears saturation, young customers and prepaid are key to growth, he said. "I'm sure we took significant market share in the prepaid area," Ritcher said in a phone interview. "We think we're very well positioned in those parts of the market that are going to grow higher than average." Cingular's profit and revenue has trailed that of the next biggest rival, Verizon Wireless, owned by Verizon Communications Inc. ( VZ.N ) and Vodafone Group Plc. ( VOD.L ). Its fourth-quarter margin for operating income before depreciation and amortization was 34.4 percent, below King's expectation of 36.4 percent. Ritcher said Cingular hoped to have the best operating profit margins in the industry next year, forecasting margins above 40 percent for 2008. King said the 2008 industry-leading margin target would be difficult to meet as the operating margin for Verizon Wireless had already hit 45 percent in the third quarter of 2006. Ritcher forecast 2007 margins in the high 30 percent range in 2007. Cingular had earlier aimed to lead the industry on all metrics by the end of 2007. Cingular average revenue per user rose to $49.29 from a $48.86 a year ago and its churn, or customer cancellation rate fell to 1.8 percent from 2.1 percent a year ago.
