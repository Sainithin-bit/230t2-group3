 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Advanced Micro Devices Inc. ( AMD.N ) expects price competition for computer processors to be very challenging through 2007, Chief Executive Hector Ruiz said on Tuesday. 

 "Pricing is very, very challenging and we expect it to be for all of the year," Ruiz told analysts on a conference call after the chief rival to industry leader Intel Corp. ( INTC.O ) reported a quarterly loss due in part to falling chip prices.
