 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Chocolate maker Hershey Co. ( HSY.N ) on Wednesday posted quarterly profit that lagged already lowered quarterly estimates, as it had higher expenses for products that did not sell as well as expected. 

 The company also said it has named David J. West as chief operating officer, to focus on day-to-day operations, while Chairman and Chief Executive Richard Lenny will focus on the company's strategic direction and innovation. West has been chief financial officer. The company, which was hit by a product recall in Canada and a temporary plant closure, posted profit of $153.6 million, or 65 cents a share, for the fourth quarter, compared with $170.4 million, or 69 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding restructuring charges, earnings were 67 cents a share. Analysts on average had forecast 71 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales fell 0.7 percent to $1.34 billion. The maker of Hershey's Kisses, Reese's peanut butter cups and other products, which in October said it was losing U.S. market share to Mars Inc., is trying to focus on growing its core products and developing new lines like premium dark chocolate. That strategy is a shift from recent years, when the company was able to outperform most foodmakers by relying on short-term limited edition variations of current products to increase sales. That strategy turned less successful as retailers became less willing or able to sell all the new products Hershey offered. The company stood by its 2007 forecast calling for sales to increase 3 percent to 4 percent, with earnings per share from operations up 7 percent to 9 percent.
