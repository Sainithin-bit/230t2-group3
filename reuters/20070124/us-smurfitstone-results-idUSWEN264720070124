 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Smurfit-Stone Container Corp. SSCC.O, a maker of cardboard and corrugated packaging, posted a fourth-quarter profit on Wednesday, reversing a year-earlier loss that included revamping and legal charges. 

 The company said net income was $22 million, or 9 cents a share, compared with the year-ago loss of $92 million, or 36 cents a share. Analysts polled by Reuters Estimates had expected the company to post earnings of 6 cents per share. Revenues for the quarter climbed to $1.8 billion from $1.6 billion a year ago. Smurfit-Stone said it achieved $243 million in benefits from its restructuring by year-end, slightly better than its $240 million target. "We expect a meaningful year-over-year improvement in 2007 operating results," Chairman and Chief Executive Patrick Moore said in a statement, although he said the first quarter will be hurt by seasonal factors such as lower mill production, higher energy usage and higher fibre costs.
