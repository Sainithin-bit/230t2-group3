 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc. ( QCOM.O ) posted a better-than-expected rise in quarterly profit on Wednesday on solid demand for its wireless chips, sending shares up more than 3 percent. 

 Net profit rose to $648 million, or 38 cents per diluted share, for the fiscal first quarter ended December 31, from $620 million, or 36 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. Profit was 43 cents a share after excluding results from its investment arm and adjusting for other items, topping the average analyst estimate of 42 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 16 percent to $2.02 billion. Qualcomm forecast second-quarter earnings of 42 cents to 44 cents a share on revenue of $2 billion to $2.1 billion, excluding investment results. Analysts, on average, estimated earnings of 44 cents a share on revenue of $2.097 billion. The company also raised its full-year net earnings forecast to a range of $1.44 to $1.49 per share from its earlier estimate of $1.41 to $1.46. Last month, Qualcomm cut its first-quarter profit estimate, citing legal costs. The company faces several legal disputes, including a flurry of lawsuits and countersuits over patent infringement involving rival chipmaker Broadcom Corp. ( BRCM.O ), and regulatory complaints in Europe from several rivals over its competitive practices. Qualcomm is also in negotiations with Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ) ( NOK.N ), the world's biggest cell phone maker, over a technology license pact that expires in April. Qualcomm is the biggest supplier of chips based on CDMA, a wireless technology used in the United States and other countries. It also sells technology licenses and chips based on W-CDMA, a mobile phone standard gaining popularity in Europe. Its shares rose 3.4 percent to $39.93 in post-market trade after closing at $38.62 on Nasdaq.
