 ST PETERSBURG, Russia  (Reuters) - Russia's Sberbank could offload its stake in German auto maker Opel in the future to local car producers GAZ, IzhAvto, Sollers or TaGaz, a high-level Sberbank source said on Friday. 

 On Thursday, Sberbank chief executive German Gref announced a 500 million euro cash injection for Opel to help it save jobs at home, while totally restructuring its assets abroad. Gref said Sberbank and its partner in the winning consortium for Opel, Canada's Magna International Inc, will each commit part of the funds in proportion to their stakes. Gref also said Sberbank could offload its Opel stake in the future to a Russian company. Many analysts have said the stake could end up with GAZ, controlled by Russian businessman Oleg Deripaska, which is playing the role of an industrial partner in the Sberbank- Magna's Opel deal. "Why only GAZ? There are also TaGaz, IzhAvto and Sollers," the Sberbank source said when asked who could buy the stake. All Russian car makers are suffering from plummeting sales and have had to stop production on many occasions this year. A source at IzhAvto, which has placed its controlling stake as collateral with Sberbank against loans, told Reuters the company is considering assembling Opel cars at its factory. "The options of using IzhAvto for assembling (Opel cars) is not ruled out ... because Sberbank is interested in this asset (IzhAvto) to continue working," the IzhAvto source said. The deal struck last week to save Opel from the bankruptcy of its U.S. parent General Motors Corp gave Sberbank 35 percent of the company and Magna 20 percent.
