 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Aluminum Corp of China (Chinalco) has not decided on its next step following the collapse of its bid for Rio Tinto, a spokesman for the state-owned Chinese company said on Friday. 

 "We have not thought through (what to do next)," company vice-president Lu Youqing told Reuters. Asked why Chinalco had not offered revised terms, Lu said: "This is from both sides, not from one firm." Chinalco has also not decided whether to participate in Rio Tinto's share placement. "We have not finalized that. This is a big thing and is not determined by a single person," Lu said. Chinalco is the parent of Chalco. (Reporting by Polly Yam; Editing by Chris Lewis)
