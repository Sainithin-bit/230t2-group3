 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The chairman of the U.S. Senate Banking Committee warned banks on Thursday against gouging consumers with excessive and deceptive checking account fees. 

 Christopher Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat who faces reelection next year, did not specify what actions he might take against banks. "While we just scored a tremendous victory for consumers against unfair and abusive credit card practices, we're now seeing that a few banks have applied some of the same unscrupulous practices to bank accounts," he said. Last month President Barack Obama signed into law credit card reform legislation that will crack down on unfair interest rate hikes and varies fees and late charges. Democrats now appear focused on targeting practices involving fees charged for overdrawing on bank accounts. "At a time when so many families are already struggling to make ends meet, automatic overdraft charges and other excessive fees are forcing consumers deeper into debt," said Dodd, the author in the Senate of recently adopted legislation curbing high credit card fees and sudden interest rate increases. In the House of Representatives, New York Democrat Carolyn Maloney introduced legislation that would require banks to obtain approval from a customer before automatically apply fee-based overdraft protection. Recently, Maloney and other key House Democrats sent a letter to the Federal Reserve urging policymakers to issue rules requiring banks to obtain customer approval for transactions involving debit cards and automatic teller machines. The Fed is expected to issue a set of final rules later this year. (Reporting by  Kevin Drawbaugh  and  John Poirier ; Editing by Kenneth Barry)
