 (Reuters) - Global chip sales are expected to fall 21.3 percent year-over-year to $195.6 billion in 2009, the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) said. 

 The SIA forecast a rebound in worldwide sales to begin in 2010, with a year-over-year growth of 6.5 percent to $208.3 billion. In its annual mid-year forecast, the SIA also said it expects sales to grow by 6.5 percent in 2011 to $221.9 billion. In May, SIA President George Scalise said he expected economic stimulus measures in the United States combined with other countries to help sales improve from 2010.
