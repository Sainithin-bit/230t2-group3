 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission on Friday said it imposed a $2.3 million civil penalty against Mattel Inc. MAT.N for violating a ban on bringing dangerous products to the United States. 

 The fine stems from Mattel's recall of 95 types of toys and up to 2 million units, from shelves in recent years, primarily for excessive lead content in paint. The toys were all made in China, the CPSC said. (Reporting by  Kim Dixon ; editing by Carol Bishopric)
