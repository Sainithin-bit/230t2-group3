 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) said on Tuesday it will pay $46 million to settle a class-action lawsuit that accused it of paying thousands of female brokers and trainees less than it paid men. 

 The case was filed last June by six former female brokers on behalf of about 2,700 financial advisers and trainees employed at Morgan Stanley since August 2003. Plaintiffs accused the New York-based investment bank and brokerage of steering lucrative accounts to male brokers and offering men promotions and more favorable training. Some plaintiffs said they were fired because of their gender during an August 2005 elimination of about 1,000 brokers. The settlement calls for Morgan Stanley's wealth management group to institute training, management and account distribution programs designed to help female brokers succeed. Morgan Stanley will also appoint two psychologists to help develop the programs, hire a diversity monitor and allow women who allege discrimination to submit claims to a special master. The company did not admit wrongdoing, according to the settlement agreement filed with the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. The agreement lasts five years and requires court approval. Cyrus Mehri, a partner at Mehri & Skalet PLLC who represents the plaintiffs, in an interview called the settlement "a first and significant step in making sure the financial sector distributes accounts and business opportunities fairly." MAKING CHANGES The plaintiffs' lawyers estimated the cost to Morgan Stanley at over $70 million including higher compensation for female brokers and expenses to implement the new programs. They called the settlement one of the 10 largest in a U.S. gender bias case. Caroline Gundeck, head of the Morgan Stanley wealth management group's diversity office, in a statement said her company was "firmly committed" to the changes and "pleased to resolve a legal matter stemming from the past." According to court papers, the bank agreed to make significant changes to how it assigns accounts, "including reducing reliance on historical factors and more heavily weighting criteria that reflect recent performance." The diversity monitor, meanwhile, will review complaints as well as the performance of Morgan Stanley's human resources unit, the papers show. Wall Street investment banks regularly face bias lawsuits. In July 2004, in a case involving bond trader Allison Schieffelin, Morgan Stanley agreed to pay $54 million to settle charges it denied raises and promotions to hundreds of women, paid them less than men and subjected them to lewd behavior. The company in January 2006 fired four men after they accompanied at least one client to a strip club. Mehri is also involved in a similar gender bias case against Citigroup Inc.'s ( C.N ) Smith Barney unit. That case has been pending since March 2005 before the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. A Citigroup spokesman did not immediately return a call seeking comment. Morgan Stanley shares fell 4 cents to $83.52 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. (Additional reporting by  Joseph A. Giannone )
