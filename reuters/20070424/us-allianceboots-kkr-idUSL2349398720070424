 LONDON  (Reuters) - A consortium led by private equity firm Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts has upped the stakes in a bid battle for Alliance Boots AB.L, raising its offer to 1,139 pence per share after buying 49.7 million shares at that price. 

 The new cash price -- in what would be Europe's biggest leveraged buyout -- trumped an indicative offer from British buyout rival Terra Firma TERA.UL. AB Acquisitions, the acquisition vehicle of KKR and Alliance Boots Deputy Chairman Stefano Pessina, said late on Monday it now owned or had undertakings for about 21.4 percent of Britain's largest pharmacy chain. "AB Acquisitions confirms that the cash price under the transaction will be increased to 1,139 pence per Alliance Boots share," it said in a statement. The price is inclusive of any final dividend. The consortium also said it bought the 49.7 million shares in the retailer on Monday at the new price. The battle for Alliance Boots erupted on Friday after KKR and Pessina found their $22 billion improved bid -- at 1,090 pence per share -- for the company topped by Terra Firma with an indicative cash proposal worth 1,126 pence a share. Terra Firma and founder Guy Hands are due to meet Alliance Boots executives on Tuesday after the company agreed on Friday to give it the access it needed in order to make a firm offer. The buyout firm has teamed up with medical charity Wellcome Trust and banking group HBOS HBOS.L in the proposed offer. Any deal to take Alliance Boots private would be Europe's biggest leveraged buyout and the first private equity takeover of a company in the FTSE 100 index. Alliance Boots shares closed up 0.1 percent at 1,126-1/2 pence in line with the broader DJ Stoxx index of European retailers .SXRP. The stock has gained 40 percent in the six weeks since KKR and Pessina made their first offer.
