 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Germany's Siemens ( SIEGn.DE ) made forecast-beating profit and sales in its fiscal second quarter, it said in a preliminary results statement on the eve of a crucial meeting over its chief executive's future. 

 Group profit from operations rose 49 percent to 1.964 billion euros ($2.7 billion) in the quarter to end-March, Siemens said on Tuesday, easily beating the average estimate of 1.768 billion euros in a Reuters poll of 20 analysts. Siemens, a conglomerate with products ranging from lightbulbs to trains, is due to release its full quarterly results on Thursday, a day after a split supervisory board meets to decide whether to extend CEO Klaus Kleinfeld's contract. All the key figures released in the short preliminary statement were significantly higher than average forecasts in the Reuters poll, and one analyst who declined to be named said it would be "madness" to replace Kleinfeld now. Siemens' New York-traded shares ( SI.N ) pared earlier losses to trade down 0.5 percent at $124.16 by 1941 GMT. They had earlier fallen as low as $120.73 from Monday's close of  $124.76. The company's supervisory board will meet on Wednesday to decide whether to renew Kleinfeld's contract, due to expire in September, for a further five years. Some board members are in favor of bringing in an outsider as CEO, fearing that a series of corruption investigations surrounding Siemens that forced the resignation of the company's chairman last week will also draw in Kleinfeld sooner or later. Sources familiar with the situation told Reuters earlier the board was split on the issue of a contract extension after a newspaper report that a faction of the board including Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ) chief Josef Ackermann was trying to oust him. Siemens gave no reason for the strong results but U.S. rival General Electric ( GE.N ) reported robust demand earlier this month for its infrastructure products business, where it competes with Siemens in turbines and other heavy equipment. "They're obviously under pressure to deliver, plus the economy is booming," the analyst said. Siemens shares, which long traded at a discount to those of its bigger rival, now trade at 14 times expected 2008 earnings, according to Reuters Estimates, the same as GE's. "I think something's going right and it would be absolutely wrong to replace Kleinfeld at this point in time. If you're on the supervisory board, I think such a decision would be absolute madness," the analyst said. Quarterly sales rose 10 percent to 20.626 billion euros, while orders rose 9 percent to 23.469 euros. Net profit rose 36 percent to 1.259 billion euros, and income from continuing operations rose 56 percent to 1.396 billion euros.
