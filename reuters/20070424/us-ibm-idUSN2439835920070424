 BOSTON  (Reuters) - IBM ( IBM.N ) said on Tuesday it will raise its quarterly dividend by a third and its stock buyback program by $15 billion, sending its shares up nearly 5 percent. 

 "It increases the attractiveness of the stock modestly," said Icap Equity Research analyst Richard Williams. "It's a net positive." As a result of the higher share buyback, 2007 earnings per share growth -- excluding any gain from the recently announced sale of its printer business -- could be 12 to 14 percent, which is one to three points more than its previous estimates, IBM said. Wall Street was expecting per-share profit of $6.74 for 2007, which would be a 12.3 percent gain from last year's $6.00, according to Reuters Estimates. The board of International Business Machines Corp., the world's largest computer services company, also declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of 40 cents a share, payable June 9, up from 30 cents per share in the prior quarter. It authorized $15 billion for stock repurchases, which IBM said was in addition to approximately $1.4 billion that was remaining at the end of March from a prior authorization. IBM said it may complete a substantial portion of the repurchases during the next several months. Shares of IBM made their biggest jump in more than 3-1/2 years on the news. The stock was up 4.5 percent at $99.50 in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange after climbing as high as $99.90.
