 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A large U.S. union issued a report on Tuesday warning workers about the loss of jobs from private equity deals, and calling on the buyout industry to be more open. 

 The report by the 1.8 million-member Service Employees International Union (SEIU) aims to call attention to the massive wave of corporate buyouts by private equity firms. The pace of U.S. deals and the great profits accumulated by private equity executives has sparked concern among unions that buyout firms are gaining profits at the expense of workers. "The buyout deals and money generating strategies that are generating immense wealth for this industry and its investors often can have harsh consequence for workers and the companies they buy and sell," according to the 42-page report by SEIU, whose members work in health care, building services, and public services. The founders of several major private equity firms have said the industry needs to be more transparent and explain its economic role. The industry has formed a trade group, the Private Equity Council, to address issues surrounding its public image. SEIU's "Behind the Buyouts" report is also one of the first signs that opposition from Europe's unions toward private equity deals is spreading to the United States. The rising chorus of union opposition has prompted governments across Europe to take action. Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers are mulling whether to alter the tax structure governing private equity deals. Private equity firms buy companies and take them private by borrowing most of the money. They typically restructure the business, cut costs, and sell it later for a profit. The firms typically cut jobs to improve profit margins and move production overseas. While the firms argue that by improving the business they increase jobs in the long-term, unions decry the practices. A steady global economy and a frothy debt market has led to the largest private equity activity ever, with firms doubling deal volume last year on $660 billion worth of buyouts. The recent spate of public to private deals represents only 3 percent of publicly traded companies worth $750 million or more, according to TPG (formerly Texas Pacific Group) co-founder David Bonderman. Still, unions are worried that the buyout wave is rising. The SEIU report cited a study of buyouts in Great Britain between 1999 and 2004. After six years, more than 60 percent of firms added jobs, while 35 percent cut jobs, it said. SEIU also raises the question of whether wages increase or decrease after a buyout. The report recommends that private equity firms be more transparent and be involved with communities impacted by an acquisition. It also says that industry statistics are often skewed to make it look like buyout firms create more jobs than they really do. In addition to outlining five major buyout firms and the huge fortunes of their founders, the report also examines five private equity deals. The union identifies the buyouts of Warner Music Group Corp. WMG.N, Intelsat, KB Toys and Hertz as examples of private equity excesses. The purchase of three Boeing plants by Canadian buyout firm Onex Corp. ( OCX.TO ) in 2005 is cited as an example of a private equity deal that created jobs and wealth for workers.
