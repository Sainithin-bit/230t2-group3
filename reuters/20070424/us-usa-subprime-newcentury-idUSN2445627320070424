 WILMINGTON, Delaware  (Reuters) - New Century Financial Corp. ( NEWC.PK ) won bankruptcy court approval on Tuesday to proceed with the sale of its key loan origination unit in a swift auction that will end next week. 

 U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Kevin Carey in Wilmington, Delaware said he will sign an order approving the auction, at which the company will seek offers of at least $1 million. The auction will end on May 2. Carey said he also will sign an order allowing New Century to sell its Access Lending Corp. subsidiary, which it acquired last year. New Century has court approval to sell its loan servicing unit and more than 2,000 loans. New Century was the largest independent U.S. provider of home loans to people with poor credit histories before it filed for bankruptcy earlier this month. The company buckled under rising delinquencies and defaults, a federal criminal probe, and orders by or agreements with at least 17 U.S. states to stop lending. New Century on Tuesday agreed to filed its financial reports by May 31. Its Pink Sheet-traded shares closed down 3.5 cents at 92.5 cents.
