 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings Inc. CME.N said on Tuesday that first-quarter profit surged 42 percent, but its shares fell almost 3 percent as analysts said slower derivatives trading in April could trim second-quarter results. 

 The recent slowdown in trading partly reflects prospects for Federal Reserve interest rate policy to stay unchanged into the third quarter, which has cut volume in Eurodollar futures and options, CME's biggest product line. Richard Repetto, a principal at Sandler O'Neill in New York, said April-to-date volume, at 4.8 million contracts a day, could be on the way to the first year-on-year decline since November 2003. "To reach our (second quarter) volume estimate ... CME would need to trade an average of 8 million contracts per day in May and June," Repetto said in a research note. Edward Ditmire, an analyst at Fox-Pitt Kelton in New York, cut his second-quarter estimate for CME to $3.71 per share from $4.04 based on the slow start to second-quarter trading. But if the second quarter looks shaky, CME's first quarter was nothing of the sort. The largest U.S. futures exchange said net income was $130 million, or $3.69 per share, against $91.4 million, or $2.61 a year ago. That easily beat the average Wall Street estimate of $3.62, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 32 percent to $332 million percent from $251.7 million a year earlier, but was short of the average forecast of $337 million. CME's operating margin was a record 60 percent, up from 55 percent a year ago. "We surpassed volume records in all our product lines, leading to the strongest top-line, quarter-over-quarter growth since 2004," said CME Chairman Terry Duffy. Duffy downplayed the slow start to April trading, which CME has blamed on trader absences around the Passover and Easter holidays. "The quarter is a long way from over," he said. CME's first-quarter average rate per contract (RPC), a key measure of margins, slipped to 64.4 cents from 65.5 cents in the fourth quarter and 65.2 cents a year ago. Working capital rose about $90 million during the quarter to $1.4 billion as of March 31. The exchange said in October it would merge with the Chicago Board of Trade Inc. BOT.N, the No. 2 U.S. futures exchange. The outcome of that deal is unclear after Atlanta's IntercontinentalExchange Inc. ( ICE.N ) submitted a higher bid in March that CBOT's board is considering. The proposed CME-CBOT deal, which would leave the combined entity with about 85 percent of U.S. futures volume, is also undergoing a Department of Justice review. Chief executive Craig Donohue said CME "continues to work diligently" through the Justice Department review, which he said has not dragged on longer than expected, and said he was confident the CBOT deal would close around mid-year. "While we continue to believe CME is the favored merger partner to CBOT, (a) material likelihood exists that CBOT could demand better terms," said Ditmire. CME closed at $531.30 per share, down $16.10, or 2.9 percent, on the New York Stock Exchange, its lowest since March 29.
