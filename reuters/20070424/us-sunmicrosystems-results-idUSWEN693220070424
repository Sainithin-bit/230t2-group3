 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Computer maker Sun Microsystems Inc. SUNW.O on Tuesday posted a quarterly net profit versus a year-ago net loss but revenue fell shy of analysts' estimates and shares fell about 5 percent. 

 Over the last three quarters, Sun saw decent growth in its mainstay server business. But it appears to have slowed in the just-reported quarter, according to an analyst. "People are a little concerned about the demand trends. It does suggest there could potentially be a slowdown in their server business," said Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brent Bracelin. "What had gotten people excited was their server business for the last three quarters grew." Sun said net income for its third fiscal quarter was $67 million, or 2 cents per share, compared with a year-ago net loss of $217.0 million, or 6 cents per share. Revenue rose to $3.28 billion from $3.18 billion. Analysts had expected a profit of 1 cent per share, on average, according to Reuters Estimates, based on revenue of $3.42 billion. According to Sun's income statement for the just-reported quarter, Sun had an operating loss of $45 million. As is customary with Sun, it did not provide a forecast for revenue and earnings per share for the current fourth period. However, Sun Chief Executive Jonathan Schwartz said in a statement that the company "remain committed" to its fourth-quarter goal of reaching at least a 4 percent operating profit margin. However, with the just-reported small profit, Sun has posted two quarterly profits in a row, following five quarters of losses. Since the implosion of the dot-com and telecommunications investment bubbles, Sun has suffered more than its main competitors IBM ( IBM.N ), Dell Inc. DELL.O and Hewlett-Packard Co. ( HPQ.N ) In the last few years, however, the seller of computer servers, workstations, software, storage and services has revamped its product line. Among other things, it now sells servers powered by chips from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. ( AMD.N ) and Intel Corp. ( INTC.O ) Shares of Sun have risen 9.2 percent so far this year, based on Monday's closing price. Shares of HP are up less than 1 percent in the same time period. Shares of Dell are down 1 percent so far this year. In extended trade, Sun shares slipped to $5.62. In regular Nasdaq trade, the stock rose 2 cents to $5.94.
