 LONDON  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks are expected to open flat on Tuesday as markets focus on home sales data to determine the extent of the weakness in the U.S. housing market, while a barrage of corporate results is also due. 

 Shares of chip maker Texas Instruments TXN.N are in focus after the company reported a smaller-than-expected fall in quarterly profit and said a broad recovery would help it beat second-quarter targets. Shares in Texas jumped more than 9 percent in extended trading. AT&T ( T.N ), Lockheed Martin ( LMT.N ), McGraw-Hill MHP.N, Sun Microsystems SUNW.O, Whirlpool ( WHR.N ), Dupont ( DD.N ) and Amazon ( AMZN.O ) are due to unveil earnings. By 0950 GMT, Dow futures DJM7 were flat and S&P futures SPM7 were also little changed. "What we need to see is home sales start a definite trend. The numbers have been inconclusive so far," said Steve Previs, senior vice president at Jeffries International. Existing home sales likely dipped to 6.45 million units in March on a seasonally adjusted annual basis from 6.69 million in February, according to the median forecast in a Reuters survey. The data is due at 1400 GMT. In February, existing home sales increased 3.9 percent, the biggest gain since March 2004. A report from the Conference Board on its index of consumer sentiment will also be a highlight for markets. European stock markets extended early losses on Tuesday, with the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index  .FTEU3  down 0.8 percent at 1,566.0 as Spanish equities took a tumble on worries over property stocks. On Wall Street, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. ( AMD.N ) might be in focus after the company said it will offer up to $2.2 billion in convertible notes, raising capital for the No. 2 computer chip maker at a time when it is losing money. Its shares fell 2.8 percent after the announcement. U.S. stocks fell on Monday after oil prices rose and a General Motors ( GM.N ) executive said the crisis in U.S. mortgage lending hurt U.S. auto sales this month, stirring concerns of an even wider economic impact. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  hit an intraday record of 12,983.9, but failed to breach the milestone of 13,000 as sentiment turned on rising fears of the impact of the housing market problems. The Dow closed 0.3 percent lower at 12,919.4 and the Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  slipped 0.1 percent to 2,523.7.
