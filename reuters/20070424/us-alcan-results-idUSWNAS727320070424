 MONTREAL  (Reuters) - First-quarter profit rose 32 percent at Alcan Inc. AL.TO ( AL.N ) on higher primary aluminum prices, and better pricing, product mix and volumes in its downstream businesses, the company said on Tuesday. 

 Alcan, the world's second-largest maker of primary aluminum, said it earned $591 million, or $1.60 a share, up from $453 million, or $1.21 a share, a year earlier. On a fully diluted basis, profit was $1.59 a share versus $1.20 a share a year earlier. Analysts had expected Alcan to earn $1.48 a share in the latest first quarter, before exceptional items. Revenue rose 15.7 percent to $6.42 billion from $5.55 billion. Alcan said it expects stronger results in the second quarter from the first quarter in its bauxite and alumina business and packaging group. It expects second-quarter results for its primary aluminum operations to be similar to first-quarter figures, but forecast a slight decline in profit for its engineered products business.
