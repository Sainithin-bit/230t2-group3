 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - DuPont Co. ( DD.N ), the No. 2 U.S. chemical company, said on Tuesday that first-quarter profit rose 16 percent, spurred by strong seed sales and growth outside the United States that more than offset lower volumes in the U.S. housing and automotive markets. 

 Profit increased to $945 million or $1.01 a share, from $817 million, or 88 cents a share, a year earlier. DuPont reported quarterly earnings of $1.07 a share, excluding a 6 cent per share charge related to an increase in an existing litigation reserve. "I was actually pleasantly surprised by coatings and color technologies, where you basically had pricing up 3 percent and volume up 2 percent." said HSBC analyst Hassan Ahmed. This indicates that DuPont is offsetting weakness in the U.S. housing and auto markets with strength in other regions, said Ahmed. Quarterly net sales rose to $7.85 billion from $7.39 billion. Analysts on average had forecast profit of $1.04 per share, on revenue of $7.74 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. "We continue to improve operating margin and return on capital as we deliver on our growth strategies." said Charles Holliday its chief executive, in a statement. DuPont affirmed its full-year 2007 forecast for earnings of about $3.15 per share, excluding a 6-cent charge for significant items. Wall Street expects full year earnings of $3.18 per share. The Wilmington, Delaware-based company, which makes products ranging from bullet-proof Kevlar suits to hybrid seeds, has struggled with a slowdown in the U.S. housing and automotive markets. DuPont's annualized sales to the residential construction and automotive end markets represent about 20 percent of its consolidated sales. BUMPER CROP DuPont said sales from its agricultural and nutrition segment increased 13 percent to $2.5 billion during the quarter. The company said pretax operating income from the segment rose 9 percent to $651 million from $597 million a year before. The company is in an uphill battle to regain market share in the domestic corn seed market from Monsanto Co. ( MON.N ), the world's leading developer of biotech crops. The U.S. corn planting season began recently, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture has forecast that more than 90 million acres of the crop will be planted this year -- the highest acreage in the nation since World War II. Corn prices topped $4.00 per bushel earlier this year, the highest in 10 years. While prices have slipped since, they still remain well above the $2 levels seen in early 2005. The growth in corn acreage and soaring corn prices are the result of a strong demand for ethanol fuel, which is primarily made from corn in the U.S. Furthermore, steady demand for corn from the food and livestock feed sectors, coupled with fears that unfavorable weather conditions would delay crop plantings has helped buoy prices for the cereal. Shares of DuPont, the largest U.S. chemical company by market capitalization, have fallen almost 1 percent to $49.19 in the last three months, compared with a gain of almost 4 percent in the Standard & Poor's Chemicals Index .GSPPM.
