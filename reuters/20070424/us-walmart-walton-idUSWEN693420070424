 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - The death of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) heiress Helen Walton will not require sales of a large block of the company's shares, her family said in a statement on Tuesday. 

 Instead, a significant portion of the shares owned by Helen Walton's estate will pass, over a period of years, to charities, the family said. Helen Walton, the widow of Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton and the matriarch of one of the richest families in U.S. business history, died on April 19 at age 87.
