 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Whirlpool Corp. ( WHR.N ) reported a lower but better-than-expected first-quarter profit on Tuesday as strong international appliance sales helped offset declining U.S. demand, and its stock shot up as much as 16 percent to a record high. 

 The world's biggest appliance maker backed its previous forecast for full-year earnings, and said benefits from last year's buyout of Maytag exceeded integration costs in the quarter. "In a tough environment in North America, Whirlpool is gaining market share," said Craig Hutson, senior bond analyst with Gimme Credit. Net earnings came to $117 million, or $1.46 a share, edging down from $118 million, or $1.70 a share, a year earlier. Excluding discontinued operations, earnings were $1.55 a share, better than the $1.09 analysts expected, according to Reuters Estimates. Whirlpool is counting on savings from last year's Maytag buyout, new products introduced world-wide and price rises to fuel earnings as steel and parts costs rise as much as $500 million this year. Efficiencies from the Maytag purchase came to $106 million in the first quarter, higher than merger costs of $14 million, the company said during a conference call. "Higher raw materials costs are hurting, but they are controlling (general) expenses very well," said Morgan Keegan analyst Laura Champine. Total sales rose 24 percent to $4.39 billion, helped by the inclusion of Maytag and international strength. Excluding Maytag, sales were up 2 percent. In North America, Whirlpool's largest market, revenue rose 27 percent. But operating profit in the region fell $37 million to $159 million, hurt by lower industry appliance demand amid the slower U.S. housing market and higher materials costs. Quarterly revenue rose 15 percent in Europe as Whirlpool began selling its premium KitchenAid appliances there. Sales gained 29 percent in Latin America and 20 percent in Asia. In the United States, industrywide shipments of washers, refrigerators and other major appliances fell 9.5 percent during the quarter. Whirlpool said it still expected lower U.S. demand through the first half, with gradual improvement the rest of the year. MAYTAG GAINS DISPLAY SPACE Maytag is scoring gains as Whirlpool cuts costs and revitalizes the brand with products such as the Bravos, a high-efficiency top-loading washer that sells for about $1,000, and the more traditional-looking Centennial, unveiled to mark the 100th anniversary of the Maytag washing machine this year. In May, retailer Best Buy Co. ( BBY.N ) will re-introduce Maytag appliances after a two-year absence. Whirlpool also said Amana appliances would be sold at Lowe's Cos. ( LOW.N ) stores. The Maytag buyout included the Amana and Jenn-Air brands. "Whirlpool has done a really good job with the Maytag integration," said Mirko Mikelic, senior portfolio manager with Fifth Third Asset Management. Whirlpool, based in Benton Harbor, Michigan, also announced it would resume its $500 million share buyback program in the second quarter. The company backed its prior profit view of $8 to $8.50 a share for the full year. Analysts have forecast $8.07, according to Reuters Estimates. The company also said it still expects savings of more than $400 million by 2008 from the Maytag purchase. Whirlpool shares were up more than 12 percent, or $11.23, at $101.60 in afternoon New York Stock Exchange trading after hitting $105.21 earlier in the session. The stock has risen 22 percent so far this year.
