 (Reuters) - An Indonesian court cleared the local unit of Newmont Mining Corp. ( NEM.N ) and its American president of all charges on Tuesday, in a high-profile pollution trial that has been closely watched for its implications on foreign investment. 

 Here is an overview of the mining sector in the archipelago of 17,500 islands and some of the challenges. INVESTMENT: -- Mining investments in Indonesia, home to some of the world's largest deposits of coal, copper, tin, nickel and gold, averaged some $800 million annually from 2001 to 2005. -- Global mining companies -- such as Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. ( FCX.N ), PT International Nickel Indonesia ( INCO.JK ) and Newmont Mining have undertaken some of the largest mining projects, but the country has not seen major investment in several years. -- Last year the mining sector grew 2.2 percent, against overall economic growth of 5.5 percent. -- In 2006, the Ministry of Mines set a target of $931 million to be spent by foreign and local investors in the mining sector overall. REGULATIONS: -- A new mining law, aimed at clarifying current regulations, has been delayed after a year of discussions. -- Mining firms have expressed concern over draft proposals to replace working contracts with mining licenses, which can be altered any time and are valid for shorter periods. SECURITY: -- Paramilitary police have been called to guard mineworkers at several large mines. In 2004 they were dispatched to PT Inco's Sulawesi nickel operations, and expatriate employees were moved to another location. -- In August 2002, two U.S. teachers and an Indonesian were killed in an ambush on a convoy of Freeport employees near Freeport's Grasberg mine in remote Papua province, straining relations between Jakarta and Washington. ENVIRONMENT: -- Grasberg, the world's largest copper-gold mine, has long been controversial because of its environmental impact, the share of revenue going to Papuans and the legality of payments to Indonesian security forces who helped guard the site. -- Tsunamis, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, flooding and landslides can all make mining challenging in the chain of islands, which are situated on the Pacific's seismic hotbed, the so-called "Ring of Fire".
