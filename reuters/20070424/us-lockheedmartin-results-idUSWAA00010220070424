 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp. ( LMT.N ) and Northrop Grumman Corp. ( NOC.N ) reported higher first-quarter profit on Tuesday, but failed to trounce bullish Wall Street forecasts for the booming defense sector, sending their shares lower. 

 Lockheed, the world's largest military supplier, beat Wall Street's profit forecast chiefly through one-time gains, while Northrop, the Pentagon's No. 3 supplier, missed analysts' profit estimate as a strike at one of its shipyards ate into earnings. Both reported relatively slow sales growth across the board, despite record levels of U.S. military spending. Lockheed, maker of F-16 fighter jets, Patriot missiles and an array of systems for the U.S. government, reported quarterly profit of $690 million, or $1.60 per share, compared with $591 million, or $1.34 per share, a year earlier. Taking out 21 cents per share of one-time gains, Lockheed had earnings of $1.39 per share. Wall Street's average forecast was for $1.37 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose only 1 percent to $9.3 billion as higher information and electronic system revenue offset lower sales at the company's satellite equipment and aircraft manufacturing units. Analysts were expecting slightly higher sales of $9.56 billion. ONE-TIME GAINS Lockheed's quarterly profit was boosted by one-time gains from the sale of land and reversing some legal reserves after settling litigation. It also had lower pension costs. The company, which outsold rivals Boeing Co. ( BA.N ) and Northrop to be the Pentagon's No. 1 supplier last year, raised its full-year profit forecast to take account of the gains and better performance across the board. Lockheed raised its full-year earnings forecast to a range of $6.20 to $6.35 per share, up from its previous range of $5.80 to $6.00. Wall Street is expecting $6.06 per share, on average. It also pushed up its full-year sales forecast by $100 million to a range of $40.35 billion to $41.35 billion. The new forecasts take into account the financial impact of the U.S. Navy's decision earlier this month to terminate Lockheed's contract to build a second shore-hugging Littoral Combat Ship, Lockheed chief financial officer Chris Kubasik said. Lockheed shares were down $1.77, or 1.8 percent, to $95.30 in late-morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. NORTHROP MISSES Northrop -- the Pentagon's No. 3 supplier behind Lockheed and Boeing -- reported first-quarter profit rose less than expected, as higher sales of its military equipment were offset slightly by strike costs. The company, which makes warships, nuclear submarines, unmanned surveillance planes and a range of military electronics, said quarterly net profit rose to $387 million, or $1.10 per share, compared with $358 million, or $1.02 per share, in the year-ago quarter. Wall Street was expecting $1.14 per share, on average, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 4 percent to $7.3 billion, below analysts' average forecast of $7.49 billion. A nearly month-long strike at Northrop's Ingalls shipyard in Pascagoula, Mississippi -- which ended April 4 -- cut the company's profit by about 2 cents per share, Northrop executives said in an interview. For the full year, Northrop kept its earnings forecast unchanged at $4.80 to $5.05 per share. Wall Street is expecting $5.00 per share, on average. Northrop shares fell $2.02, or 2.6 percent, to $74.60 on the NYSE.
