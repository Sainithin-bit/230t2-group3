 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Pepsi Bottling Group Inc. PBG.N said on Tuesday that quarterly profit fell nearly 15 percent, hurt by higher costs for aluminum used in cans and corn syrup, which is used as a sweetener. 

 The largest bottler of PepsiCo Inc. ( PEP.N ) drinks said net income was $29 million, or 12 cents per share, for the first quarter, compared to $34 million, or 14 cents per share, a year ago. The latest quarter's results included an expense of $4 million, or 2 cents per share, related to an accounting change. Analysts on average were expecting 10 cents per share, excluding items, according to Reuters Estimates, after the company forecast 9 cents to 11 cents per share. Revenue rose 4 percent to $2.47 billion from $2.37 billion a year ago. Worldwide sales by volume was flat in the quarter, as an 8-percent increase in Europe offset a 1-percent decline in the United States. The bottler, based in Somers, New York, affirmed its prior forecast for full-year earnings of $1.90 to $1.98 per share, including the 2-cent per share accounting charge. It also said it expected operating free cash flow to be in the range of $530 million to $550 million. In January the company had forecast that worldwide volume would be flat to down 2 percent in the first half of the year, due to the seasonality of its European business and the fact that much of the raw material cost increases were expected to hit in the first six months of the year. Pepsi Bottling Chief Executive Eric Foss had said the rising costs for raw materials was unprecedented. Soaring demand from the ethanol industry has been sapping U.S. corn supplies, sending corn prices to a 10-year high in late February. The market has since retreated as farmers make progress planting the 2007 corn crop, but prices remain higher than usual.
