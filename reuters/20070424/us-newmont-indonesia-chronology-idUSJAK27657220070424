 (Reuters) - The trial of the Indonesian unit of the world's biggest gold miner, Newmont, and its American president over alleged pollution from a North Sulawesi gold mine ended on Tuesday with all charges dropped. 

 Here is a timeline tracing key moments in the 20-month trial. - August 2005: Pollution trial begins four years after Newmont ceases mining at the Minahasa Rasa gold mine it has operated in Sulawesi island since 1996. Locals say the mine poisoned their water supply and depleted fisheries. Newmont denies wrongdoing, saying the government approved its tailings disposal process. - February 2006: Newmont agrees to pay $30 million over 10 years to settle a separate civil suit launched by the Indonesian government over the pollution. - May 2006: Newmont and its American President Director Richard Ness begin their defense. - July 2006: Newmont retests water samples after conflicting evidence: the WHO and Japan's institute for Minamata Disease show mercury levels are not unusual, but police tests show Newmont's disposed water exceeded limits on heavy metals. - September 2006: Court in Manado, North Sulawesi, adjourns as prosecutors request more time to construct case. - November 2006: Prosecutors ask for a three-year jail term for Ness for failing to stop pollution, a one billion rupiah (US$110,800) fine for the company, and that Ness pay 500 million rupiah or serve an additional six months in prison. - Jan 9, 2007: Trial resumes. Newmont's lawyer says expert witnesses and facts show it did not break environmental laws and Ness denies charges in court two days later.- - April 24: Newmont and Hess are cleared, as the chief judge announces the pollution charges cannot be proven. Prosecutors said they may appeal the verdict within 14 days. Sources: Reuters, JATAM (www.jatam.org/english), Newmont (www.newmont.com/en/pdf/Buyat_Bay_Brochure.pdf)
