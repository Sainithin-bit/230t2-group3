 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Aflac Inc. ( AFL.N ), the world's largest seller of supplemental disability insurance, said on Tuesday that earnings rose in the first quarter as premium income in the United States climbed nearly 11 percent. 

 Earnings totaled $416 million, or 84 cents a share, up from $375 million, or 74 cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter. Aflac, which insures people against the cost of illness and injury, said operating earnings, which analysts use to measure performance because it excludes investments, were $407 million, or 82 cents a share. Analysts, on average, had expected Aflac to earn 79 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. In the year-ago quarter, the Columbus, Georgia-based insurer earned $364 million, or 72 cents a share.
