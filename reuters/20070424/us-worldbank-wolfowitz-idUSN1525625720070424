 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - World Bank President Paul Wolfowitz has hired a high-profile lawyer who hopes to present to a special bank committee Wolfowitz's case that he was not unethical in directing a promotion for his girlfriend. 

 Robert Bennett, a Washington lawyer who has represented clients like former President Bill Clinton, said he hoped to present Wolfowitz's case to a bank committee now assessing whether he abused his position or breached ethics in promoting and approving generous pay rises for his companion Shaha Riza, a bank official. "We are going to expect the bank to give Mr Wolfowitz a fair process and to give us the opportunity to show what he did was totally proper and ethical," Bennett told Reuters. He said Wolfowitz would not resign and said he had not been hired to negotiate a termination agreement for the embattled bank president, the former U.S. deputy defense secretary and architect of the invasion of Iraq. Wolfowitz has apologized for his handling of Riza's promotion, before she was moved to an outside job at the urging of a board ethics committee when Wolfowitz became president. As the debate over Wolfowitz has gathered intensity over the past 10 days, the White House has repeatedly declared President George W. Bush's confidence in Wolfowitz whom he nominated for the World Bank job in early 2005. Riza was moved to the State Department in September that year and given a hefty pay rise and promises of a promotion when she returned. A World Bank staff association has said this action violated rules and has called for Wolfowitz to resign. "With the perfect science of hindsight after the ethics committee told him to go forward with her, I suppose you could say, 'No ethics committee I think it is better not to.' "But he didn't do that and that is hardly unethical conduct and certainly not something you would talk about removing the president of the bank," Bennett said. Asked if Wolfowitz had erred by not clearing the promotion with the bank's board, Bennett said: "It's not a hanging offense. You don't get rid of the president of the bank for that, and anyone who thinks that is what the issue is, is being toyed with." LIST OF DOUBTERS Meanwhile, Norway joined a growing list of doubters over Wolfowitz's leadership, as bank member countries consider how to resolve the controversy. "There is no doubt confidence in World Bank leadership has been undermined," Norway development minister Erik Solheim said. "He will have a very hard job to repair this confidence," he told Reuters in Oslo. Behind the scenes, countries who make up the bank's board said they were weighing their options, as the issue looked likely to come to a head this week. A group of European countries including Germany, the Netherlands and Britain have said they believe Wolfowitz has placed himself in an untenable position. But some other member governments, notably among developing countries, told Reuters they had not yet decided whether Wolfowitz should step down. Before a meeting with Wolfowitz, the bank's vice president for Latin America, Pamela Cox, met with staff from the region on a conference call where many said they had been embarrassed by Wolfowitz's actions, particularly because he has fervently campaigned in favor of good governance and against corruption. Cox told staff to stay focused on the mission of the bank to fight poverty, also acknowledging "negative remarks" being made against field-based employees in the countries where they are working on behalf of the bank. She urged staff to respect the process underway to resolve the issue and cautioned them not to speak to the media. "The institution has never faced a crisis like this and how we resolve this crisis as an institution is going to mean a lot to us, not only in how we face our clients going forward but how the institution is strengthened, or not, in the future," she said.
