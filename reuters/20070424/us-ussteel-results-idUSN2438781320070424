 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. Steel Corp. ( X.N ), buoyed by strong European operations, reported an almost 10 percent jump in first-quarter profit on Tuesday but forecast second-quarter results below Wall Street estimates. 

 The outlook sent the company's stock down more than 4 percent and, combined with comments about soft margins from other steelmakers such as Nucor ( NUE.N ) last week, indicated that any rebound in the steel sector will take longer than expected, despite signs of rising steel prices. "In the second quarter we expect higher shipments, and spot prices are improving, so that will have a good effect on our businesses," Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John Surma told analysts on a conference call. He declined to say how much spot prices would improve in the second quarter but commented that an analyst's estimate of 4 to 5 percent was accurate. Surma also said, however, U.S. Steel expected some routine blast furnace and strip mill outages during the quarter that will cost $25 million to $30 million more than in the first quarter and reduce some production. First-quarter net earnings rose to $273 million, or $2.30 per share, from $256 million, or $2.04 per share, a year earlier. Excluding a one-time charge for early debt retirement, earnings were $2.32 per share, far above analysts' average forecast of $1.88 as compiled by Reuters Estimates. The Pittsburgh-based steelmaker estimated second-quarter results would be in line with the first quarter, but that would be well below the average Wall Street estimate of $2.62 per share. SEEN AS DISAPPOINTMENT In January U.S. Steel, which had cut domestic capacity because of high customer inventories and foreign imports, announced it was ramping up production as demand and prices improved, and Surma said the first quarter looked brighter as customer inventories leveled off and appeared to decline. Analysts had been expecting a stronger second quarter for steelmakers after a weak first quarter, said Charles Bradford, an analyst with Bradford Research/Soleil. "The guidance for the second quarter was not very favorable." "We believe that this will be viewed as a disappointment," said independent steel industry analyst Michelle Applebaum. Sam Halpert, an analyst with Van Eck Global, a mutual fund that manages $3.8 billion, said U.S. Steel results were good and the second-quarter outlook was not bad, but that there had been unrealistic expectations from Wall Street. "People were looking for really big numbers," he said. The company's U.S. Steel Europe business showed the biggest gains during the first quarter, with income from operations rising to $206 million from $125 million a year earlier. Operating income from flat-rolled products fell to $75 million from $127 million. Shipments declined even as average prices rose to $650 per ton from $616. For tubular products, average prices dropped to $1,435 per ton from $1,506 a year earlier as shipments fell to 247,000 tons from 319,000. Chief Financial Officer Gretchen Haggerty told the conference call that U.S. Steel's $2.1 billion acquisition of Lone Star Technologies Inc. LSS.N, which makes products to line oil wells and build pipelines, should be completed by the end of the second quarter or early in the third. Also on Tuesday, AK Steel Holding Corp. ( AKS.N ) reported first-quarter profit jumped by more than 10 times to $62.7 million on higher steel prices and shipments. U.S. Steel shares closed down 3.7 percent, or $3.96, at $103.04 on the New York Stock Exchange. AK Steel gained $1.24, or 4.17 percent, to close at $30.99.
