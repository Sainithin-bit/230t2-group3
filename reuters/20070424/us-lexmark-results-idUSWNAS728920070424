 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Computer printer maker Lexmark International Inc. ( LXK.N ) said on Tuesday quarterly profit rose 7 percent but the results and its outlook missed Wall Street expectations, sending shares down 4 percent. 

 Sales of equipment Lexmark made for other brands continued to be weak in the first quarter, which also saw a decline in sales of inkjet supplies, and aggressive hardware pricing in the laser and inkjet markets, the company said. It said net income for the quarter rose to $92.4 million, or 95 cents a share, from $86.2 million, or 78 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time costs for restructuring, profit per share was 96 cents, missing the average $1.03 forecast by analysts, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue fell 1 percent to $1.261 billion, in line with the $1.26 billion forecast by Wall Street according to Reuters Estimates. Under pressure to improve its results, Lexmark last year said it would reduce sales of unprofitable inkjet printers, a move that some analysts have said would shrink the number of its printers on the market and cut into profitable sales of supplies. Lexmark forecast on Tuesday second-quarter revenue to fall in the low- to mid-single digit percentage range year over year, and estimated earnings per share to be in the range of 82 cents to 92 cents. Analysts were looking for second-quarter revenue to rise less than 1 percent to $1.23 billion, and forecast net profit per share at 95 cents, or $1 excluding items. Lexmark shares, which have declined about 17 percent so far this year, fell to $59.50 in light pre-market trading from their New York Stock Exchange close on Monday of $62.01.
