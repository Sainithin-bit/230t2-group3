 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - The United Steelworkers union asked U.S. oil companies on Tuesday to reopen talks over health and safety at the nation's refineries. 

 "I've asked the industry to sit down and have an honest discussion about handling safety effectively," said USW Vice President Gary Beevers in a statement. "Let's conduct a thorough analysis, then negotiate a signed agreement that addresses the alarming deterioration in safety throughout the oil industry." The National Petrochemical & Refiners Association, which lobbies the U.S. Congress on behalf of the industry, said cooperation on safety should not be part of labor-management confrontations. NPRA held up as a model of cooperation its worker safety workshop which is planned for the fall and at which labor union representatives are scheduled to speak. The union's call for talks has resulted from after 13 fires at oil industry installations in April and May, during which 19 workers died and 25 workers were injured. Eleven workers were killed on board the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig in an April explosion in the Gulf of Mexico. Seven workers died after a blast at Tesoro Corp's Anacortes, Washington, refinery. "Improving safety shouldn't be a battle between adversaries, or something negotiated by opposing sides in labor contracts," said NPRA President Charlie Drevna in a statement. "It should be a campaign of allies." Beevers said companies and their hourly employees can cooperate through the contract bargaining process. "We are more than happy to cooperate with the industry in workplace safety and think we can do that with bargaining," he said. "Having a contract makes both parties accountable for health and safety. Promises alone do not work." An agreement, if reached, would become part of the national contract for refinery workers represented by the USW. About 30,000 refinery workers are represented by the union. Conclusion of talks in 2009 for the current contract between the union and leading refiners was delayed as the USW pushed for an agreement on safety.
