 PERTH  (Reuters) - Australia's watered down mining tax is still among the highest tax regimes around the world and needs deeper study before Rio Tinto ( RIO.AX ) ( RIO.L ) will commit to its next big expansion in iron ore, the mining giant's iron ore division head Sam Walsh said on Tuesday. 

 "We're in the process of reopening our study in relation to the Pilbara expansion," Walsh told reporters. "There is still a lot of work that needs to be done in relation to tying up the value and engineering work and obviously the impact of the MRRT (minerals resource rent tax)." Rio has set a production target of 330 million tons in 2015, up from a projected 230 million this year. The tax was rejigged following consultations with Rio Tinto, BHP Billiton ( BHP.AX ) ( BLT.L ) and Xstrata XTA.L. The miners threatened to cancel billions of dollars in investments if the tax wasn't modified to reduce the headline rate below 40 percent and to exempt existing projects. Under the original tax proposal, Rio said it had been forced to rethink its iron ore growth plans in Australia, raising concerns it would lead an investment shift away to more tax-friendly countries. Walsh said the new version of the tax remained one of the steepest of its kind in the world, but indicated it had become more palatable to the mining sector since its reworking. "We needed to  resolve this subject to get on with life," Walsh said. "Pandora's Box had already been opened that the mining companies were going to pay more tax."
