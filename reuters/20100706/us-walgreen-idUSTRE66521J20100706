 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Top drugstore chain Walgreen Co ( WAG.N ) reported a better-than-expected rise in June same-store sales after it filled more prescriptions and saw improving demand for non-prescription items. 

 Sales at drugstores open at least a year rose 2 percent in June, better than the 1.1 percent rise expected by five analysts, according to Thomson Reuters data. The company, which bought New York's Duane Reade drugstores earlier this year, said its pharmacy same-store sales rose 1.8 percent in June, while same-store sales of general merchandise like milk, aspirin, toothpaste and cosmetics rose 2.2 percent. Total June sales rose 8.4 percent to $5.67 billion. The acquisition of Duane Reade added 3 percentage points to the rise in total sales. Results from those stores were not included in the same-store sales calculations. As of June 30, Walgreens operated 8,038 drugstores. Last month, Walgreen ended an 11-day standoff with rival CVS Caremark Corp ( CVS.N ) over reimbursements for drug prescriptions, saving a relationship worth billions of dollars. Walgreen shares were up 2 percent at $26.89 Tuesday morning on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by  Dhanya Skariachan , editing by Gerald E. McCormick, Dave Zimmerman)
