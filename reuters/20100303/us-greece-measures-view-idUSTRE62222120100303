 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Greece's cabinet on Wednesday decided to take extra austerity measures totaling 4.8 billion euros to ensure it meets key fiscal targets this year, a government source told Reuters. 

 Greece will hike VAT to 21 percent, raise taxes on fuel, tobacco and alcohol, and slash its public wage bill further, a draft law obtained by Reuters on Wednesday showed.

Their effective implementation offers a shield to this year's budget from possible slippages due to high interest payments and needs to fund for the social security system, even under a much gloomier scenario about GDP growth. If the (package) is implemented faithfully, it will help fiscal consolidation in the coming years as well and it is closer to the Irish model, although it is based more on revenues." -- BEN MAY CAPITAL ECONOMICS The fiscal measures announced by Greece today should allow the Government to ease the short-term pressure on its finances with a bond issue and may lead to firmer support from other countries. As expected, the measures amount to an additional 4.8bn euros (or 2% of GDP) this year and include a rise in VAT, further tax hikes on fuel, alcohol and tobacco, and additional cuts to the public-sector wage bill. Given that the package has been put together under negotiation with the EC, the latter will presumably give a favorable response to Greece's next public finances progress plan to be submitted by 16th March. The measures should also allow Greece to press ahead with a planned bond issue of around 5bn euros in the next few days -- note that bond yields have already fallen to around 6% in anticipation of the measures, lower than at the time of the last auction. This will obviously help to ease Greece's near-term cash problems. But with some 20 billion euros of debt maturing in April and May, the Government will need to raise much more from the markets over the coming months. And for that, firmer pledges of support from other euro-zone countries are still likely to be required. The Greek PM's meeting with Angela Merkel on Friday could be crucial." (London Treasury Desk)
