 NEW YORK/FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc is set to make a near $4 billion offer for German generic drug maker Ratiopharm GmbH this week, competing with bids from Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd and Actavis, several sources familiar with the situation said. 

 Pfizer, the world's largest drugmaker, had previously cooled on Ratiopharm, however it was asked to rejoin the auction and present its bid to Ratiopharm's board and management, two sources said. Pfizer was expected to "be competitive" with a rival offer from Iceland's Actavis, one source said, adding Pfizer could still walk away without submitting a binding offer. The auction could linger several more weeks, with a decision unlikely before the end of the month, a second source said. Several sources told Reuters in February that Teva and Iceland's Actavis would be bidding for Ratiopharm. One source said at the time that the offer from Actavis was the highest, at close to 3 billion euros ($4.1 billion). That would make the deal the biggest generics takeover since Teva's $7.5 billion purchase of U.S. rival Barr, announced in July 2008. Industrial heir Ludwig Merckle put Ratiopharm on the block as part of concessions made to creditors by his father Adolf Merckle, who committed suicide in January 2009 after ceding control of his business empire to lenders during the financial crisis. Pfizer and Ratiopharm declined to comment. Shares in Pfizer were down 0.85 percent and Teva shares were up 0.61 percent at 1157 GMT. Pfizer is joining drug majors such as Sanofi-Aventis and Novartis who have coupled their traditional research-based drugs businesses with generics arms to turn the loss of patent exclusivity -- at least in part -- to their advantage. Drugs representing annual sales of $95 billion are facing generic competition in the years 2009 to 2013. The U.S. drugmaker has struck a string of collaboration deals and acquisitions to bolster its range of generics, particularly injectable drugs. An alliance with India's Strides Arcolab Ltd in January marked the latest step. A tie-up with Ratiopharm could help Pfizer reduce costs at its generic pills business, analysts at Credit Suisse said. Pfizer derives more than $10 billion in sales from off-patent drugs at its so-called "established products" unit -- to a large part from its own medicines that have lost exclusivity.
