 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co ( 7201.T ), Japan's third-biggest car maker, said it will recall about 540,000 vehicles worldwide due to potential defects in brake pedal pins and fuel-gauge components, mostly in the United States. 

 Nissan said five models from 2008 to 2010 model years, including the Titan truck and Armada SUV, would be recalled due to the risk of the brake pedal pins partially disengaging, causing a loss of normal braking ability. This recall will involve 179,000 cars in the U.S. and 25,800 in other regions, Nissan said in a statement, adding that there have been three reported cases of this braking problem. Nissan also announced plans to recall 419,000 cars in the U.S. and 53,000 in other regions for a separate problem with the fuel gauge, which can at higher mileage levels fail to accurately indicate how much fuel is left in the tank. The gauge problem involve six models from the 2005 to 2008 model years, including the Titan, Armada and the Infiniti QX56. Nissan said no accidents or injuries have been reported.
