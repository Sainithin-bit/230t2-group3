 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The White House has contacted Massachusetts Institute of Technology Professor Peter Diamond about joining the Federal Reserve's board of governors, Bloomberg reported, citing two people familiar with the discussion. 

 The report on Tuesday comes a day after Fed Vice Chairman Donald Kohn announced that he will retire in June. Kohn's departure means President Barack Obama has three seats to fill on the Federal Reserve's seven-member board. The Bloomberg report said Diamond, 69, is not being considered for the vice chairman position. A senior administration official, asked about the report, said Obama has made no decisions or offers regarding the Fed appointments.
