 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. services sector grew in February at its fastest pace in more than two years, according to an industry report released on Wednesday. 

 KEY POINTS: * The Institute for Supply Management said its services index rose to 53.0 from 50.5 in January. The reading was the highest since December 2007 and well above the 51.0 median forecast of 71 economists surveyed by Reuters. * A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the services sector, which accounts for the majority of U.S. employment. The index's employment component jumped to 48.6 from 44.6 the prior month while the prices paid component fell to 60.4 from 61.2. COMMENTS: RICHARD SPARKS, SENIOR EQUITIES ANALYST, SCHAEFFER'S INVESTMENT RESEARCH, CINCINNATI, OHIO "You've got a number that is slightly higher than what was expected, you saw a little bit of a pop there on the S&P 500. We've really been in a situation where we've been in rally mode again after a little bit of a pullback on the Greece news. So we're being greeted here with positive news and that is being well received in the market. It's interesting how when markets go down, very often when bad news or news that doesn't meet expectations, the same thing is happening here with good news. "The number wasn't that big of a beat, it did go up from the prior number and also beat expectations but not by a huge margin. It's going to be received as a positive in the market. In addition to that it is not a number going to be nearly as important as the employment numbers that come out tomorrow or Friday, so the impact will be slightly positive but not terribly significant." ALAN LANCZ, PRESIDENT, ALAN B. LANCZ & ASSOCIATES INC, TOLEDO, OHIO "The numbers this week have been all above consensus and last week was a little disappointing, so investors are running with the news this week. "I don't think we'll continue in a straight up path but the trend is definitely forward progress." JIM O'SULLIVAN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MF GLOBAL, NEW YORK "It's an encouraging number for the recovery. Momentum in these numbers is still up especially in the employment component. Unlike the payrolls number which will be affected by weather, these data are telling you more on a trend basis. The trend in employment is still improving. "We are still predicting a 130,000 decline in payrolls in February because of the snow impact. People may have to write-off Friday's payrolls numbers because they are weather distorted." TONY CRESCENZI, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, PACIFIC INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT CO., NEWPORT BEACH, CALIFORNIA. "The important thing here is that the recovery has been manufacturing-led, and this data suggests that the (recovery) is broadening out. "This could have important implications for the overall jobs market since manufacturing accounts for around 80 percent of non-farm payrolls. "It's an offset to the recent news on consumer confidence and jobless claims." DENNIS CAJIGAS, SENIOR MARKET STRATEGIST, LIND-WALDOCK, CHICAGO: "The market seems to be fairly neutral. We haven't really reacted significantly since the ISM number came out. It could be discounting it, waiting for more information out of the February non-farm payrolls report later this week." WILLIAM LARKIN, PORTFOLIO MANAGER WITH CABOT MONEY MANAGEMENT, SALEM, MASSACHUSETTS: "The service side is a major segment of the U.S. economy. It is definitely indicating improvement. We are back to pre-crisis levels. "It tells us that things are normalizing, which means that Fed policy needs to move from emergency mode to accommodative." STEVE GOLDMAN, MARKET STRATEGIST, WEEDEN & CO IN GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT: "The number is good, but it typically isn't a market mover. We've had a decent move recently and a lot of secondary indexes are reaching new recovery highs. I think we'll move higher on this, since it was a favorable reading on what constitutes a large percentage of the economy, but for the market, it seems like a lot of low-hanging fruit has been picked." JOSEPH TREVISANI, CHIEF MARKET ANALYST, FX SOLUTIONS, SADDLE RIVER, NEW JERSEY: "Reasonably good for the dollar. Improvement in overall activity and slight improvement in new orders and employment. The economy is very slowly improving and this will over time support the dollar." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stock indexes added to gains. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices added to losses. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar held losses.
