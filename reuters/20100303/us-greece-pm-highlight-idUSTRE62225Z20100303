 ATHENS  (Reuters) - The Greek Government on Wednesday unveiled 4.8 billion euros worth of new austerity measures designed to meet European Union demands for extra savings and pave the way for any rescue from the threat of bankruptcy. 

 Following are highlights of the measures as outlined by government spokesman George Petalotis. REVENUE MEASURES "The immediate measures to increase revenues are worth 2.4 billion euros with VAT (bands) rising from 4.5 to 5 percent, 9 to 10 percent and 19 to 21 percent." FUEL TAX "Special fuel taxes are being raised further to yield 1.1 billion euros." TAXING YACHTS, JEWELS, CARS "A tax on luxury goods will be introduced ... on cars with a market value above 35,000 euros, yachts and jewels." PROPERTY TAX "We are introducing a one-off social responsibility contribution on the owners of large property which will yield about 200 million euros." CHURCH TAX "We are taxing the church, not just its large property holdings but also the revenues generated by its commercial use which are not currently taxed."
