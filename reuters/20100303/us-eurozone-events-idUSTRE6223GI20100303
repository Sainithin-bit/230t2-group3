 (Reuters) - Greece's cabinet approved a sweeping new austerity program on Wednesday, the third in as many months, to rein in a bulging budget deficit and secure European financial support. 

 Greece is the first country in 11 years of European monetary union to require a political pledge of support as fears over its debt sparked a market attack that dented the euro and lifted Greek bond yields, making debt servicing even more challenging. Markets also have other euro zone countries such as Spain and Portugal in their sights. Here are some details on forthcoming events in Greece, Portugal and Spain: * GREECE: REFORM: -- March -- Greece has to report back to its European partners on progress of its deficit-cutting plan by March 16. -- April -- Government plans to bring a pension reform bill to parliament, to eliminate early retirement and increase the effective retirement age to 63 from 61 by 2015. STRIKES: -- Labor unions have threatened more strikes in March, in protest at the government's austerity plans. ROADSHOWS: -- Greece is considering roadshows to the United States and Asia, including China and Japan, aiming to diversify its debt investor base, now largely European. Greek officials had originally said that the roadshows could take place end-February or early March, but Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou said they would be pushed back due to his heavy schedule. VISITS: -- Prime Minister George Papandreou will pay an official visit to Germany on March 5, at the invitation of Chancellor Angela Merkel. -- Papandreou will also visit France on March 7. BIG DEBT MATURITIES: April 20 - Government has to refinance 8.2 billion euros of a maturing five-year, 3.1 percent fixed-coupon government bond.
