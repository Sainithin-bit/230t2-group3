 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Following are analysts comments after Greece's cabinet approved a sweeping new austerity program, the third in as many months, intended to rein in a bulging budget deficit and secure European financial support. 

 A government spokesman said the package of public sector pay cuts and tax increases would save an extra 4.8 billion euros ($6.5 billion), equivalent to 2 percent of gross domestic product. LATEST COMMENTS DIEGO ISCARO, IHS GLOBAL INSIGHT "The deteriorating economic situation, combined with the still high uncertainty levels prevailing in markets, put the government between a rock and a hard place. Indeed, the revised GDP figures released alongside the Q4 data suggest that the government's ambitious target of cutting the fiscal deficit by 4 percentage points in 2010 was unlikely to be met without further measures. In principle, I believe that the measures announced by the government should help to emphasize its commitment to bring the public finances to a sustainable path and provide some calm to markets. The risk is that, as the measures are too focused on the revenue side, their result may actually be dampened by plunging activity levels. Earlier comments NICK MATTHEWS, ECONOMIST, RBS "It's too early to say Greece is out of the woods but it's another step in the right direction. Today's announcement represents about 2 percent of GDP. I think the fact that the Greek prime minister said yesterday the government is finding new holes in the budget on a daily basis suggests these measures are to ensure the targeted 4 percentage point narrowing of the budget deficit this year is met, rather than representing an even more ambitious deficit reduction plan. To some extent the market will remain skeptical and I think the emphasis will move to implementation. The markets in the last days do seem to be scaling back some of the pessimism. But it's clear to us there is a safety net for Greece that is in place via the other members of the euro area, and help is at hand should there be any problem. So we don't think there's a sudden funding stop risk with Greece. Provided the markets continue to react well to Greece and (Greek) news I think they should be able to go to the market. CHRISTOPH WEIL, ECONOMIST, COMMERZBANK "The measures are enough and I think they'll reach the target for deficit reduction this year. This I think is okay and confidence in markets will increase. "We've seen in last days the spreads between Greek government bonds and German bunds has been decreasing and I think this development will continue in the coming days. "Normally it's always better to cut spending but in politics I think a mix of one-third expenditure cuts and two-thirds increase in tax is ok. (Question: will they need financial support from Europe?) "At the moment I would say no. I think they will find buyers in the markets so I think at the moment the EU does not have to help Greece." MARCUS HETTINGER, GLOBAL CURRENCY STRATEGIST, CREDIT SUISSE, ZURICH "We have already seen that Greek bonds have tightened a bit against German bonds because of reports about the Greek plans, and this is taking a bit of the risk premium out of the euro. "We also have Papandreou meeting Merkel on Friday and Sarkozy on Sunday so these are still a factor." JEREMY STRETCH, CURRENCY STRATEGIST, RABOBANK, LONDON "We are seemingly on the path toward Greece getting at least implicit support from the EU, which could give the euro some support, but it is still just a sticking plaster over a wider problem. "The market will probably shrug it off and await the March 16 deadline ... (as well as) the reaction of the Greek population is."
