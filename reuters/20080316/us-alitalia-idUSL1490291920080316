 ROME  (Reuters) - Nearly bankrupt Italian carrier Alitalia AZPIa.MI has agreed to be bought by Air France-KLM ( AIRF.PA ), the world's biggest airline by revenue, for a smaller-than-expected sum of $184 million and a pledge to buy back bonds. 

 A hot issue ahead of Italy's general election on April 13-14, the deal still needs the blessing of Italy's next government and Alitalia's strike-prone unions, which gave the agreement a cold reception, before it can be concluded. Opposition leader Silvio Berlusconi, currently ahead in opinion polls, has in the past criticized the sale to Alitalia's long-time partner and European neighbor, saying he favors an Italian solution. The takeover would end the 60-year independence of a global Italian brand, but would also avoid the flagship airline going broke as its cash reserves quickly dry up while the European Union has banned any more state aid. The airlines said Air France-KLM in its binding bid had offered one share for every 160 shares of Alitalia, valuing its stock at 0.10 euros a share, or 138 million euros in all, an 81 percent discount to the record low price at Friday's close. That price is well short of the 0.35 euros per share that Air France-KLM was said to have initially bid and is closer to the 1 cent-per-share offer from domestic player Air One, which lacked the deep pockets of its rival and was snubbed by Rome. Air France-KLM also offered to pay 608 million euros to buy back Alitalia bonds and pledged to underwrite a 1 billion euro cash call to shareholders as part of a commercial overhaul. The share swap will take place as early as June, Alitalia said in a statement after Italian stock market regulators asked for clarification. Air France-KLM set a deadline of March 31 for several conditions on its offer, including agreement with airports operator SEA over a 1.25 billion euros claim for damages for cutting slots at Milan's Malpensa Airport in half to 170. The 138 million euro price for Alitalia stock is equivalent to roughly two days' of revenues at Air France-KLM, which was founded from a merger of French and Dutch flag carriers in 2004. The restructuring should return Alitalia to an operating profit, which it has not posted since 1998, as early as 2009, the Franco-Dutch carrier said. GROUND JOBS THREATENED Alitalia has been on the block for more than a year as the Italian government unsuccessfully hunted for a buyer for its 49.9 percent stake. Rome is expected to approve the sale this week. Though Air France-KLM has been considered a likely buyer for years, it snubbed an initial auction for Alitalia last year that failed, and expressed its interest only in December. Alitalia bowed to the terms of the offer after a marathon board meeting that started on Saturday morning and continued into the early hours of Sunday. Only part of Alitalia's ground services unit, AZ Servizi, will be taken over by Air France-KLM, signaling overall job losses could be higher than the 1,700 expected. Alitalia's unions, which fear steep job cuts among AZ Servizi's 8,000 employees, attacked Air France-KLM for keeping them in the dark on expected job losses. Comments by one major union, Filt-Cgil, underscored the challenges ahead of Alitalia. "We have said many times that we will say yes only to an offer for the whole group: Alitalia and AZ Servizi," said union leader Mauro Rossi. "A logic in which one piece of the company is saved and the other thrown away will never find agreement." Other Alitalia unions, such as those representing pilots, have been more favorable to a deal with the French carrier. Reaction from some right-wing and far-left politicians was also hostile, with politicians in northern Italy crying foul over Air France-KLM's plans to scale back at the Milan hub. On the campaign trail, clutching olive branches for Palm Sunday, Berlusconi declined to comment on Alitalia on Sunday. Just under half of the 8.7 million shares to be issued by Air France-KLM will go to the Rome government, implying an Italian government stake of 1.4 percent in Air France-KLM, lower than a 3 percent previously reported. Italy's government is expected to extend a 300 million euro credit line to Alitalia to allow the carrier to continue operations while the deal is completed and the capital hike carried out. Alitalia has warned it needs a fresh cash infusion by mid-year to keep flying. It had a share market value of 746 million euros at Friday's closing price of 0.5383 euros.
