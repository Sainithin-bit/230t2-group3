 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - The euro's strength against the dollar will make it harder to sell Europe-made cars like the Opel Astra profitably in the United States, a newspaper quoted the CEO of General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) as saying. 

 U.S. carmaker GM has decided to start marketing the Opel Astra model in the United States under the brand name Saturn toward the end of this year. Germany's Opel is part of the GM group. "When we made that decision the profitability outlook was better than today," GM CEO Rick Wagoner told Germany's Welt am Sonntag newspaper, according to a preview obtained on Saturday of an article due for publication on Sunday. "Now it's going to be more difficult because the euro is simply so strong," Wagoner was quoted as saying. The euro  EUR=  has appreciated to around $1.30 from $1.20 in the past 12 months.
