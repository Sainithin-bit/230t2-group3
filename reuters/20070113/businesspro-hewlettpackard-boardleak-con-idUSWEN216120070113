 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - A Colorado private investigator 
on Friday pleaded guilty to identity theft and conspiracy 
charges, the first conviction arising from the Hewlett-Packard 
Co. ( HPQ.N ) board-room leak scandal, the U.S. Department of 
Justice said on Friday. 

  Bryan Wagner, 29, pleaded guilty to the two felony charges 
during his initial appearance in San Jose federal court, the 
U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California 
and the Federal Bureau of Investigation said on Friday.  "In pleading guilty to two felony counts, Wagner admitted 
that he was paid as part of a conspiracy that made fraudulent 
use of Social Security numbers and other confidential 
information to obtain the personal phone records of reporters 
and HP officials, as well as the personal records of these 
individuals' family members," according to a press release 
issued by the Department of Justice.  The board-room leak scandal emerged in September 2006 when 
Palo Alto, California-based HP initially disclosed that it had 
undertaken an investigation to ferret out the source of board 
room leaks to the media.  Others charged in the criminal investigations arising from 
the board leak scandal include Patricia Dunn, HP's former 
chairman, former HP chief ethics officer Kevin Hunsaker and 
Ronald DeLia, an HP security contractor who runs a Boston-area 
private investigative firm called Security Outsourcing 
Solutions.  HP has declined to comment because Wagner was not an HP 
employee. Wagner could not immediately be reached for comment.
