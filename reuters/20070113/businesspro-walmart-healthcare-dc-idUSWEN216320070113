 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ) on Friday 
issued a clarification about the number of employees enrolled 
in its company-sponsored medical plans, immediately drawing 
fire from a critic group. 

  The retail giant's recently released health care enrollment 
numbers have been questioned by critics groups, citing a 
published report of 638,000 enrollees for 2006.  Wal-Mart said enrollment numbers fluctuate daily as people 
get hired, become eligible or leave the company.  "The numbers we have provided are accurate," the company 
said in a statement. "As reported in The Wall Street Journal, 
the 638,000 was an estimated number that didn't account for 
turnover or changes in our associate base at that point in 
time. We said - in public and on our Web site - that as of 
January 2006, we had roughly 615,000 associates enrolled in 
Wal-Mart's medical plans."  In response, Wal-Mart critic, WakeUpWalMart.com, said the 
retailer has inflated its healthcare enrollment claims.
