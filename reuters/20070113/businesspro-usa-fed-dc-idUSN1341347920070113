 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben 
Bernanke will testify before Congress on monetary policy on 
February 14 and 15, The Wall Street Journal reported on 
Saturday. 

  Typically, the Fed chairman's twice-a-year report to 
lawmakers on monetary policy involves speaking for one day 
before a Senate committee and another in front of a House of 
Representatives committee.  But this time, new House Financial Services Committee 
Chairman Barney Frank plans an extra day of hearings to gather 
input from outside experts on Bernanke's remarks, the Journal 
reported.  Economists and labor experts could be asked to provide 
their views on the Fed chairman's testimony, the newspaper 
said, quoting an interview with the Massachusetts Democrat.  Frank also told the Journal that while he opposes an 
inflation target, the Fed has the authority to implement one 
without congressional approval.  The Fed should not allow a target to result in employment 
being subordinated to inflation, Frank said, adding he would 
not allow the Federal Reserve Act to be amended to allow that 
to happen.  Spokespeople for Frank and the Senate Banking Committee 
could not immediately be reached by Reuters on Saturday.
