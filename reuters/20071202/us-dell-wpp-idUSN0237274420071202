 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. computer manufacturer Dell Inc DELL.O said on Sunday it will invest $4.5 billion in marketing over three years as part of an agreement to form a new agency with Britain's WPP ( WPP.L ) that will handle all of the company's advertising and marketing. 

 Dell, the No. 2 personal computer maker behind Hewlett-Packard Co ( HPQ.N ), formerly used over 800 agencies worldwide to handle all its advertising and marketing campaigns. WPP, one of the world's largest advertising and marketing services firm, edged out peers like Interpublic Group ( IPG.N ) and Omnicom Group ( OMC.N ) to win the account, a spokesman for Dell said.
