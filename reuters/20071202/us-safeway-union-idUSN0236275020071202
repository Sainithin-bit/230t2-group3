 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Supermarket chain Safeway Inc said on Sunday it has reached a tentative agreement with four unions that represent about 25,000 of its retail clerks and other personnel. 

 The United Food and Commercial Workers Unions, on Friday, said its members would begin to vote to authorize a strike, if an agreement was not reached soon. Details of the new agreement were not disclosed, the unions will present the new agreements to their members for ratification in the coming weeks, the company said.
