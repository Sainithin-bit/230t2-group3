 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of Western Union Co ( WU.N ), the world's largest payment transfer company, could be worth as much as $35, said an article in the latest edition of Barron's, citing some investors and an analyst. 

 Western Union shares are cheap, given the company's efficient global money-transfer business and growth opportunities. The stock could gain 20 percent or more, according to the article in the December 3 edition of Barron's. The report cites Robert Loest, a senior portfolio manager at Integrity Growth and Income Fund, who calls the stock a "temporary steal" and believes that it is worth $35. Western Union shares closed at $22.60 on Friday. (Reporting by  Euan Rocha )
