 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Workers at United Technologies Corp's Pratt & Whitney jet engine unit in Connecticut approved a new three-year contract on Sunday. 

 The previous contract with the 4,100 members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers union was due to expire on December 2. The company and the union first sat down to negotiate a deal over the summer, in hopes of avoiding the threat of a year-end work stoppage. Union members in August voted down the company's first offer, citing job security concerns. Talks resumed in November. Under the new contract, members will get a 3.5 percent wage increase each year for the next three years and members will also get a one-time ratification bonus of $3,000, said a company spokesman. Last year, workers at United Technologies' Sikorsky helicopter unit struck for six weeks, leaving the company scrambling to catch up with demand.
