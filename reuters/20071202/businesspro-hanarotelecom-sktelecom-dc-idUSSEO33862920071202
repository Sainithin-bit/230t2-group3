 SEOUL  (Reuters) - Top South Korean mobile operator SK 
Telecom ( 017670.KS ) on Monday said it had agreed to buy a stake 
in broadband provider hanarotelecom ( 033630.KQ ) for 1.09 
trillion won ($1.18 billion) in cash, a near 50 percent premium 
on pre-acquisition talks. 

  The price values shares of the country's No. 2 broadband 
provider at 11,900 won each, slightly lower than the latest 
closing price of 12,200 won, but represents a 46 percent 
premium from the stake's valuation before talk of an SK bid 
started in early November.  A consortium led by American International Group ( AIG.N ) 
and private equity fund Newbridge Capital NB.UL bought the 
38.9 percent stake for $500 million in 2003 and picked SK as 
preferred buyer in November.  SK Telecom will become hanarotelecom's largest shareholder 
with 43.6 percent after the deal.  Analysts had seen SK Telecom as a good strategic buyer for 
the stake in hanarotelecom, which has a quarter of the 
country's broadband market. Adding broadband to its business 
portfolio would enable SK Telecom to package offerings of 
broadband, telephone and mobile services, and trim costs.  The acquisition also raises prospects for further 
concentration in the country's telecommunications industry, 
with top fixed-line and broadband operator KT Corp ( 030200.KS ) 
increasingly likely to absorb mobile affiliate KTF 032390.KS.  (Reporting by Marie-France Han and Kim Soyoung, editing by
