 PARIS  (Reuters) - Aeroflot ( AFLT.MM ) is studying the possibility of ordering Airbus' ( EAD.PA ) revamped and more efficient airliner, the A320neo, the Russian flagship airline's chief executive said in an interview. 

 The A320neo is an updated version of Airbus' most popular jet with new engines which the planemaker says will provide up to 15 percent in fuel savings once it enters service in late 2015. "We will continue our orders," Vitaly Saveliev told French daily La Tribune. "We are studying the A320neo." "On the other hand, we don't need the A380," he said, referring to the European planemaker's superjumbo passenger aircraft. "It could be that we'll make some orders at Le Bourget," he said, referring to the Paris Air Show taking place in late June. "But we still have no idea what we might sign." All eyes in the industry are on Airbus rival Boeing ( BA.N ), which is considering building a new version of its own best-selling 737 to leapfrog the A320neo in a battle for a market estimated at $1.7 trillion over the next 20 years. Air France ( AIRF.PA ) said on Thursday that it was in talks to study the benefits of the revamped Airbus plane. (Reporting by  Christian Plumb  and  Tim Hepher ; Editing by  Dale Hudson )
