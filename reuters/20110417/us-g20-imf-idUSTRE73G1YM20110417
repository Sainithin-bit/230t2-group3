 (Reuters) - Finance chiefs from the Group of 20 nations and the 187-country International Monetary Fund met from Thursday to Sunday. 

 Following is a summary of the outcome of the meetings: THE G20'S PLAN FOR REBALANCING THE WORLD ECONOMY Leading economies edged forward with a complex plan for monitoring national policies to try to avoid a repeat of the 2007-09 financial crisis. Big countries could receive suggestions for policy fixes from the International Monetary Fund, although they would not be binding. The Group of 20 chair France wants to have the system up and running by November when it hosts a leaders summit. MORE BLAME-TRADING The United States faced heavy criticism from IMF member countries for its massive debts and budget deficit, including from some rich countries. In reply, Washington said it was moving ahead with plans to cut spending and kept up its pressure on China to speed up appreciation of its currency. DIFFERENCES OVER CAPITAL CONTROLS Policymakers did little to narrow disagreements over what to do about the huge flows of speculative cash pouring into the high-yielding markets of developing nations. IMF countries sounded sensitive to the concerns of nations such as Brazil and said policies of rich countries need to be considered for their role in the problem. G20 chair France said it still hoped for some kind of agreement by November. GREECE Greek Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou adamantly denied Athens was considering a debt restructuring, comments buttressed by a chorus of similar remarks from top IMF and European officials. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said his remark last week that "additional steps" might be needed on Greek debt were "somewhat erroneously" interpreted. The IMF said authorities were still working within the confines of the current IMF program. NORTH AFRICA AND MIDDLE EAST Egypt said it was seeking $10 billion in funding from global lenders and rich nations, but secured no public commitments. After meeting with a handful of Arab nations, some rich economies said they were ready to support reforms in the region through development lenders. However, they stopped short pledging of cash. The IMF said it would make available $35 billion to oil-importing countries in the region. (Reporting by Reuters IMF/G20 team; Editing by Maureen Bavdek)
