 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Rising food and energy prices pushed inflation at the wholesale level up twice as fast as expected last month, and prices excluding those staples rose at the fastest annual pace in a year, data released by the Labor Department showed on Thursday. 

 The overall producer price index rose 0.4 percent in September and the core index, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.1 percent in the month. Economists polled by Reuters had expected overall prices to rise just 0.2 percent and the core producer price index to rise 0.1 percent in September. Wholesale prices over the past year also rose faster than expected. Overall prices rose 4.0 percent from a year ago, compared to a 3.7 percent forecast. Core prices rose 1.6 percent over the past 12 months, the fastest pace since September 2009 and slightly faster than the 1.5 percent expected pace. The Labor Department said food costs rose 1.2 percent in September after falling 0.3 percent in August. Energy prices rose 0.5 percent in September after rising 2.2 percent in August.
