 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A federal watchdog has concluded that fraud charges filed against Goldman Sachs in mid-April by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) were not politically motivated. 

 The SEC filed civil charges against Goldman at the same time Democrats were trying to pass a landmark financial regulation bill. Some Republican lawmakers questioned the timing of the probe and suggested that the SEC may have been coordinating efforts with the White House and congressional Democrats. But according to a report by SEC Inspector General David Kotz, released on Wednesday, the Goldman lawsuit was not intended to influence or be influenced by the financial reform bill. Kotz said he found that the SEC "investigation's procedural path and timing was governed primarily by decisions relating to the case itself." The SEC's action against Goldman took the bank by surprise and sent shivers down Wall Street. The case was controversial within the agency, and the two Republican SEC commissioners voted against bringing the charges and then settling with the bank. In July, Goldman agreed to pay $550 million to settle charges related to how it marketed a subprime mortgage product. Kotz said he did not find any evidence that anyone at the SEC ever mentioned the financial reform legislation in connection with the Goldman investigation or in connection with the filing of its action against Goldman. Kotz also said there was no evidence indicating that the SEC coordinated its Goldman investigation with the Obama administration, White House employees or any members of Congress. He cleared the SEC of any wrongdoing when it released one of his damning reports that accused the regulator of mishandling an investigation into Allen Stanford's alleged $7 billion Ponzi scheme. During a congressional hearing in September, Kotz said the timing was "suspicious." But in the end he said his office "did not locate any concrete and tangible evidence" that the Goldman case was filed to coincide with the issuance of the Stanford report. SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro had vehemently disputed the allegations that the agency was influenced by politics or the legislation. On Wednesday, SEC spokesman John Nester said the report "reaffirms that the case was brought on the merits and only on the merits." Kotz did criticize the SEC for not giving Goldman enough notice. His report found that SEC staff did not fully comply with its own rules because staff did not make "every effort to notify Goldman" of the enforcement action prior to filing the suit.
