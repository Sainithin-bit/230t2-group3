 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Safeway Inc ( SWY.N ) said a drop in prices at its supermarkets moderated in the third quarter and continued to improve in the current quarter, and its shares rose more than 2 percent. 

 The company, which operates Safeway, Vons and Dominick's grocery stores, slashed prices last year to bring them more in line with those of Kroger Co ( KR.N ), Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ) and other competitors. That, coupled with the impact of falling prices overall, has weighed on results. Wall Street has been bearish on Safeway, which has lagged competitors like Kroger. "Everyone was expecting worse," said Jefferies & Co analyst Scott Mushkin. He called Thursday's share move a relief rally. Safeway's U.S. price deflation moderated as the third quarter progressed, a trend that continued in the first five weeks of the current quarter, Chief Executive Steve Burd said on a conference call. "Price-per-item changes have been the biggest issue as the year has unfolded ... We expect the U.S. numbers in terms of price per item to just continue to get better," he said. "We should be in very good shape on a price-per-item basis by the time the fourth quarter ends," Burd said. Many experts see prices for key food items heading higher in the coming months, which could benefit all grocers. Kraft Foods KFT.N, J.M. Smucker Co ( SJM.N ) and Starbucks Corp ( SBUX.O ) already have passed on price increases for coffee at commodity level, and a recent jump in corn prices could soon push up prices for everything from meat to soft drinks. But with the U.S. economy still squeezed by high unemployment and consumer debt, major makers of branded foods will have to move carefully to avoid losing customers to lower-priced private label goods produced by supermarket operators. Safeway and other grocers have declared a truce in a brutal price war that caused bargain-seeking shoppers to cherry-pick the best deals, but competition remains fierce and supermarket operators also will have to proceed with caution when it comes to passing on higher costs to consumers. Safeway shares were up 2.2 percent at $21.78 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Kroger and Supervalu Inc ( SVU.N ) were up 0.8 percent and 0.2 percent, respectively, while Wal-Mart was down 1.4 percent. A MIXED BAG Safeway company reported a stronger-than-expected third-quarter profit on Thursday but said that 2010 earnings would come in at the lower end of its forecast. The Pleasanton, California, company posted third-quarter net income of $122.8 million, or 33 cents per share. That compared with a profit of $128.8 million, or 31 cents a share, a year earlier, when it had fewer shares outstanding. Excluding employee services charges, the company earned 35 cents per share, which topped the analysts' average estimate of 31 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales fell 0.6 percent to $9.4 billion, in part because of store closures. The price per item sold fell again, resulting in a 2 percent drop in identical-store sales excluding fuel. At Safeway, identical-store sales include established supermarkets that have not been significantly renovated or replaced. Lower taxes, a higher Canadian exchange rate, higher fuel sales and more favorable interest rates benefited results in the latest quarter, Safeway said. The company also cut advertising spending and reduced the amount of product lost to waste and theft. Safeway in July cut its 2010 earnings forecast to a range of $1.50 to $1.70 a share. Analysts on Thursday prodded Burd to explain why, after posting a third-quarter profit beat, he called for 2010 earnings at the low end of that guidance. Burd said deflation continued to weigh on Safeway's results and that very low interest rates were having a negative impact on its workers compensation costs. Two weeks ago, Kroger's CEO said the largest U.S. supermarket chain for several months had been expecting a little more inflation in the grocery aisle, but that it had not yet come to pass. "I just think (Safeway's) sales have not rebounded as much as they had hoped," Mushkin said. (Reporting by Lisa Baertlein; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn,  Matthew Lewis  and Steve Orlofsky)
