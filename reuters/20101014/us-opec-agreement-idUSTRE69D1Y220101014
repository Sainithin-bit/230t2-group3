 VIENNA  (Reuters) - OPEC ministers meeting in Vienna on Thursday were "100 percent" in agreement to keep output unchanged, a delegate told Reuters on Thursday. 

 The ministers had yet to conclude the policy-setting conference, but had made a decision to keep supplies steady, the delegate said. OPEC has been widely expected to stick with a policy in place since December 2008 when it announced a record supply cut of 4.2 million barrels per day. The depth of the curbs have given the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries plenty of leeway to add or subtract supplies informally depending on the strength of the oil market. International benchmark U.S. crude futures have held a $70-$80 range for much of this year, which Saudi Arabia has said is perfect for producers and consumers, but the weakness of the U.S. dollar has this month begun to stoke a stronger rally.
