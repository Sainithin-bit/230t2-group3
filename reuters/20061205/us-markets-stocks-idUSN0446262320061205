 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Tuesday as a report showing unexpected strength in the key services sector suggested earnings growth would weather the housing slowdown. 

 The report on the services sector -- accounting for 84 percent of U.S. employment -- followed a Friday report that showed a surprising contraction in the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index in November. "The service sector is really what is holding the whole economy together and providing the impetus for growth," said Michael Metz, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Co. in New York. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  rose 47.75 points, or 0.39 percent, to end at 12,331.60. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was up 5.64 points, or 0.40 percent, at 1,414.76. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was up 3.99 points, or 0.16 percent, to close at 2,452.38. During the session, the S&P 500 rose to 1,415.27, its highest level in a little over six years. Investors also drew support from a report suggesting moderating wage inflation. COKE IS IT Coca-Cola Co. ( KO.N ), the world's biggest soft-drink maker, led the Dow's advance with a gain of 2.5 percent, or $1.17, to $48 on the New York Stock Exchange after a Morgan Stanley analyst said improved sales volumes in Japan were positive for the stock, while a Merrill Lynch analyst raised his price target on it. Coke ranked No. 2 among the S&P 500's biggest gainers. Boeing Co ( BA.N ) was the Dow's second-biggest advancer, finishing up 1.3 percent, or $1.15, at $90.73 on the NYSE, after The Wall Street Journal reported that Germany's Lufthansa ( LHAG.DE ) could announce an order for the passenger version of Boeing's updated 747 jumbo jet. For more details, see <ID:nN05314508> Boeing shares notched their biggest one-day gain in nearly two weeks. Another notable gainer was Walt Disney Co. ( DIS.N ), whose stock finished at a 5-1/2-year high. Disney shot up 2.3 percent, or 76 cents, to end at $34.20 after its chief financial officer forecast improved margins at the company's theme parks and better profitability at its movie studio. QUALCOMM RIDES CHINA WAVE On the Nasdaq, Qualcomm Inc. ( QCOM.O ) climbed 3.6 percent, or $1.36, to $38.74 after news that China may issue its first 3G, or third-generation, cell phone network license as early as this month. Qualcomm was the top advancer in the Nasdaq 100  .NDX. But the a decline among shares of software makers, whose stocks have recently been behind some of the advances in the technology sector, tempered the Nasdaq's climb. Shares of Oracle Corp.ORCL.O were the Nasdaq's top loser, down 2.2 percent, or 42 cents, at $18.86, while Microsoft Corp.( MSFT.O ), ranked as the second biggest drag, ending down 0.7 percent, or 20 cents, at $29.13. Symantec Corp. ( SYMC.O ), ended down 2.5 percent, or 53 cents, at  $20.62. Volume was moderate on the NYSE, where about 1.54 billion shares changed hands, below last year's daily average of 1.61 billion. On Nasdaq, about 2.08 billion shares traded, above last year's daily average of 1.80 billion. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a ratio of about 7 to 3, while on Nasdaq, about 8 stocks rose for every 7 that fell. (Additional reporting by  John Parry )
