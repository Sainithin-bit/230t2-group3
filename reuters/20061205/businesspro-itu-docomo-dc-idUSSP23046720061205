 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Japan's NTT DoCoMo Inc. ( 9437.T ) said 
on Tuesday it expected a gain in operating profit in the next 
fiscal year after posting a bigger-than-expected 7.4 percent 
profit decline in the first-half. 

  Executive Senior Vice President Masayuki Hirata said in an 
interview with Reuters on the sidelines of the ITU Telecom 
World 2006 forum in Hong Kong that the gain would be thanks to 
fresh revenues from international roaming and lower handset 
costs.  DoCoMo, a unit of former state-owned phone monopoly Nippon 
Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) ( 9432.T ), is speeding up 
its efforts to shift its users in Japan to so-called 
third-generation (3G) networks that allows faster music 
downloads and Web surfing.  The Tokyo-based operator will also start developing its 
"Super 3G" services, an extension of its existing network, that 
would enable data transmission speeds 250 times faster than the 
current service.  DoCoMo has been seeking to spread international roaming 
services, and its so-called "wallet phone" technology, which 
allows consumers to use their phones as debit or credit cards, 
to drive revenues and retain customers.
