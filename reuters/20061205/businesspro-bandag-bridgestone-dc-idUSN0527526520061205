 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Japanese tire maker Bridgestone Corp. 
( 5108.T ) said on Tuesday that it would pay $1.05 billion in 
cash for Bandag Inc. BDG.N, a U.S. maker of retreading 
materials and equipment, to expand its range of services to 
cost-conscious truck fleets. 

  Shares of Bandag, which would become a subsidiary of 
Bridgestone Americas, jumped 12 percent, approaching the 
proposed purchase price of $50.75 per share.  The deal is aimed at better serving truck fleet operators 
looking to extend the life of a tire, while also taking 
advantage of Bandag's international operations in markets like 
Brazil, said Bridgestone Americas spokeswoman Chris Karbowiak.  Muscatine, Iowa-based Bandag, whose 2005 sales totaled $921 
million, has a global network of franchised dealers and owns a 
retail operation that sells and repairs tires. It also has a 
controlling stake in a company that serves commercial truck 
fleets.  Bandag and Bridgestone expect the deal to close late in the 
first quarter or early in the second quarter.  Bridgestone has been beefing up global manufacturing 
capacity, and spending more on marketing and product 
development in a competitive market where rivals include 
France's Michelin ( MICP.PA ), Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. GT.N. 
and Sumitomo Rubber Industries ( 5110.T ).  Bridgestone has aimed to expand international sales of 
high-end tires, while taking advantage of demand from emerging 
markets and from construction and mining industries. It said 
last month it expects annual capital spending of about 250 
billion yen ($2.2 billion) until 2011.  The company will launch a new advertising campaign in 
February to promote consumer tires in the Americas, using the 
slogan, "Bridgestone or nothing," Karbowiak said. It replaces a 
three-year old campaign that followed a recall of 
Firestone-brand tires in 2000.  Bridgestone's North American tire unit last year settled a 
dispute with Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) over the tire recall, after 
defective tires were blamed for hundreds of deaths.  Before Tuesday's announcement, Bridgestone shares fell 0.8 
percent to 2,465 yen in Tokyo trading.  Bandag shares were up $5.40 at $50.41 in afternoon New York 
Stock Exchange trade. Earlier the stock hit a two-year high of  $50.59.  ($1=114.95 Yen)
