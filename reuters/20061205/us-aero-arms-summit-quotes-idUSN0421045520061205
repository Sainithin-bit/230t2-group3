 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The following are some notable quotes from the Reuters Aerospace and Defense Summit: 

 "The Tanker Program has lots of ghosts. A lot of people are interested in their own aspects of it and the national transparency of it. My view is that it's always better to be more transparent than less, and there are hard issues associated with this program." Kenneth J. Krieg, U.S. Department of Defense, Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics "It will be interesting if Australia had a more modern tanker than the United States." Ralph Crosby, CEO EADS North America Unit "Because this transaction creates value that can only be created through a merger, and because the bankruptcy process is designed to elicit value, we're going to get this done." Scott Kirby, president, US Airways Group, of a proposed merger with Delta Air Lines. "You don't want to expose yourself to more risk ... You want to crawl before you walk before you run." Marine Brig. Gen. David Heinz, Pentagon program office's deputy director, citing a chance that rain will delay the test flight of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. "All of the indicators, all of the forecasting agencies are saying the growth cycle is going to continue. This ride's going to continue for a while." Jack Pelton, chief executive, Cessna Aircraft Co., on the business jet boom. "I actually think a (Delta) merger with United is worth more than a merger with US Airways." Roger King, senior airlines analyst, CreditSights "I continue to view consolidation as necessary for the industry The fragmented structure that we have in the U.S. right now is really nonsensical." Bill Warlick, airlines analyst, Fitch Ratings (Editing by  Leslie Gevirtz ; compiled by Kyle Peterson; Reuters Messaging: kyle.peterson.reuters.com@reuters.net))
