 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Kroger Co. ( KR.N ) said on Tuesday that quarterly profit rose 15.8 percent and raised its 2006 earnings view, sending its shares to their highest level in five years, as the grocery chain benefited from lower prices and a better selection of products such as fresh produce. 

 The largest U.S. supermarket chain, which runs about 2,500 stores under such names as Kroger, Fred Meyer and Ralphs, as well as jewelry stores such as Littman and Barclay, said it is seeing "sustained sales momentum leading into the holiday season." It raised its sales expectations for the fourth quarter. Shares of Kroger rose 9 percent in early trading. During a conference call, Chairman and Chief Executive David Dillon said that growth was particularly strong in the produce, natural foods, deli, bakery, pharmacy and seafood departments. Profit was $214.7 million, or 30 cents per share in the third quarter ended on November 4, compared to $185.4 million, or 25 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts, on average, expected Cincinnati-based Kroger to earn 28 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Traditional U.S. grocery stores have come under increased pressure from a variety of foes: supercenters such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ), dollar stores, drugstores, natural chains such as Whole Foods Market Inc. WFMI.O and restaurants. The company, which is remodeling stores and taking other steps to improve customer service, also said that capital expenditures should come in near the low end of its $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion plan for the year. Last year, Kroger spent $1.3 billion. SALES GROWTH Kroger said sales rose 4.8 percent to $14.7 billion, falling short of analysts' average revenue forecast of $14.86 billion. But sales at identical supermarkets -- a measure that tracks stores open for at least five quarters -- were strong. Such sales rose 4.9 percent including the sale of fuel, and 5.3 percent excluding sales of gasoline. In September, Kroger had forecast identical supermarket sales growth of at least 4 percent for the rest of the year, bringing full-year growth to about 4.9 percent, excluding fuel. Kroger has gas stations at 619 of its supermarkets, and also sells fuel at its convenience stores. The company said it now expects fourth-quarter identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, to exceed 5 percent. Kroger said it has a program similar to Wal-Mart's $4 generic drug plan in three smaller markets and that its overall pharmacy business is doing well despite the influx of lower-priced drugs at discount stores such as Wal-Mart. Kroger now expects earnings per share to rise 8 percent to 10 percent this year, and said it is striving for the upper end of that range. Previously, Kroger had targeted 6 percent to 8 percent earnings per share growth. For fiscal 2007, the company still expects 6 percent to 8 percent earnings per share growth, and is now targeting growth at the high end of that range. Shares of Kroger trade at about 14 times next year's expected earnings, compared with 12 times expected earnings for Supervalu Inc. ( SVU.N ), the company's next-largest competitor. Shares of Kroger were last up $1.43, or 6.4 percent, to $23.76 in morning trading. The shares had risen 18.3 percent from the beginning of the year through Monday.
