 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Japanese tire maker Bridgestone Corp. 
( 5108.T ), will buy Bandag Inc. BDG.N, a maker of tire 
retreading materials and equipment, for $1.05 billion in cash, 
the companies said on Tuesday. 

  Bandag shares jumped $5.51, or 12.2 percent, to $50.55 in 
early trading on the New York Stock Exchange, slightly below 
Bridgestone's offer of $50.75 per share.  Bandag, whose 2005 sales totaled $921 million, will become 
a subsidiary of Bridgestone Americas. The deal is expected to 
close late in the first quarter or early in the second quarter 
of 2007.  Muscatine, Iowa-based Bandag has a global network of 
franchised dealers and owns a retail operation that sells and 
services tires. It also owns a controlling stake in a company 
that serves commercial truck fleets.  JP Morgan acted as financial adviser to Bridgestone 
Americas, while William Blair & Co. acted as financial adviser 
to Bandag, the companies said.
