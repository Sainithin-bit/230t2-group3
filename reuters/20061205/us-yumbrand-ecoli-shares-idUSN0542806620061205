 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Taco Bell on Tuesday boosted to nine the number of fast-food restaurants it had closed in New York and New Jersey after a suspected outbreak of the foodborne E. coli bacteria that may have sickened more than three dozen people. 

 But the division of Yum Brands Inc. said no new cases had been reported since November 29 and by midday it added that it was reopening the eight New York locations later on Tuesday. The New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services said on Monday it was investigating 25 confirmed cases and 12 probable cases of E. coli infection. The source of the outbreak had not been determined, but a number of those infected had eaten at Taco Bell, the department said in a statement. The state health department was expected to provide an update later in the day. Claire Pospisil, a spokeswoman for the New York State Department of Health, said on Tuesday that 14 people in Long Island had been infected with E.coli in the last two weeks. The source of those infections has not yet been identified, but health officials were looking at Taco Bell restaurants, she said. Shares of Yum, which announced at a previously scheduled investor meeting on Tuesday that it would double its quarterly cash dividend, initially traded down on the E. coli news, but were up more than 2 percent by late morning Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange. SHARE HIT 'TEMPORARY PHENOMENON' Analysts said they were monitoring the E. coli scare, which was on the front page of the New York Times and received much other media play on Tuesday. They noted, however, that such scares tend to have only a short-term effect on the stock of the company involved. "It's more of a temporary phenomenon unless it's widespread," Arun Daniel, senior retail and consumer analyst for ING Investment Management, said. "So far (the problem) appears to be somewhat contained to a certain number of Taco Bells in New York and New Jersey." Taco Bell had initially said on Monday that one restaurant in Middlesex County, New Jersey, and four in Suffolk County, New York, were closed as the company sanitized the facilities and replaced the food. A company spokesman said on Tuesday that the chain also closed four units in Nassau County, New York. All the restaurants were served by the same distributor, said Taco Bell spokesman Rob Poetsch, who declined to name the company, citing proprietary reasons. Escherichia coli is a usually harmless bacteria normally resident in the guts of animals, including humans. A new and pathogenic strain called E. coli O157:H7 was identified in 1982 and now causes an estimated 73,000 cases of infection and 60 deaths in the United States each year. Most illness has been associated with undercooked, contaminated ground beef. People generally become ill from the strain two to eight days after being exposed to the bacteria and infection often causes severe bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps, according to the Centers for Disease control and Prevention. But in some people, especially young children and the elderly, the infection can cause kidney failure. Taco Bell said it worked with health officials to have the affected restaurants inspected and reopened. Aside from the New York locations, the company said it expected to reopen the New Jersey restaurant later on Tuesday. The Taco Bell situation was not the only food contamination scare on Tuesday. SunOpta Inc. said California unit Cleugh's Frozen Foods Inc. would recall frozen strawberries sold exclusively to fresh juice and smoothie chain Jamba Juice because of a concern that the fruit may have been contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes. Listeriosis is a fatal infection that can be contracted by young children, the frail or elderly, and others with weakened immune systems. To date no suspected illnesses have been reported, SunOpta said. Jamba shares were down 3.18 percent at $10.89.
