 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Reckson Associates Realty Corp. RA.N on Tuesday said its board voted against a $4.3 billon takeover offer from billionaire financier Carl Icahn, saying the bid wasn't better than an offer from rival office landlord SL Green Realty Corp. ( SLG.N ) 

 Reckson's board also reaffirmed its support of SL Green's roughly $4 billion cash-and-stock offer and said the company would proceed with a December 6 shareholder vote on SL Green's offer. American Real Estate Partners L.P.( ACP.N ), which is 90 percent owned by Icahn, on Monday proposed paying about $1 billion in cash and $3.3 billion in a new class of preferred units. Reckson said that the newly issued preferreds could be risky as they may not have been easily traded and could have lost their value. Reckson's board also was concerned about various legal, structural and timing issues in Icahn's proposal, the company said. Icahn's proposed cash-and-unit offer of $49 replaced an earlier proposed all-cash offer from a partnership formed by Icahn, real estate developer Macklowe Associates, and New Jersey office owner Mack-Cali Realty Corp. ( CLI.N ) But the partnership and the all-cash deal unraveled over the weekend. Mack-Cali pulled out Saturday and Macklowe followed Sunday. Mack-Cali, which owns office properties primarily in New Jersey, is unrelated to Macklowe Associates, the Manhattan office owner and developer headed by Harry Macklowe. As of the end of last month, Icahn owned or controlled 4.2 percent of Reckson. Based on SL Green's closing price of $134.00, SL Green has offered to pay Reckson shareholders about $45.60 per share in cash and stock, or roughly $4 billion. Its deal includes about $2.8 billion in cash. If it succeeds, SL Green also will have to assume about $2 billion of Reckson's debt. Reckson shares ended down nearly 5 percent on Monday at $45.75.
