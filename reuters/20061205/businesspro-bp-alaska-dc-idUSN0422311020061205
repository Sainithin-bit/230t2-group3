 ANCHORAGE, Alaska  (Reuters) - BP Plc ( BP.L ) has submitted a 
revised plan for preventing and responding to spills at the 
Prudhoe Bay oil field following pipeline corrosion problems and 
oil spills earlier this year, a state official said on Monday. 

  BP's Alaska unit sent a proposed spill-contingency plan for 
the nation's biggest oil field to the state's Department of 
Environmental Conservation on Friday. The current plan expires 
in six months.  The new contingency plan was submitted as part of a routine 
renewal process that affects all oil operators and transporters 
in Alaska, said Lydia Miner, an official at the department's 
Division of Spill Prevention and Response.  It is the first new plan submitted by BP for its Prudhoe 
Bay field since a March spill from a corroded pipeline at the 
facility leaked about 200,000 gallons of oil, the largest crude 
oil spill on record for Alaska's oil-rich North Slope region.  Miner said the department had not yet reviewed the 
application to see what changes BP had proposed.  Under state law, contingency plans are in effect for five 
years, and operators must obtain renewals to continue 
conducting business in Alaska.  However, new state regulations that expand regulation over 
flow and gathering lines -- the oil-field pipelines that carry 
a mixture of oil, natural gas and water -- will go into effect 
after this contingency plan update, she said.  BP spokesman Daren Beaudo said the renewal application is 
routine and a part of its adherence to state law.  BP operates the Prudhoe Bay field, but ConocoPhillips 
( COP.N ) and Exxon Mobil ( XOM.N ) also own significant shares of 
the unit.
