 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - American Express Co. is buying Harbor 
Payments, a payment systems company that will allow businesses 
buying wholesale goods to pay electronically, officials at the 
companies said. 

  The move comes as American Express tries to expand in the 
$15 trillion annual wholesale payment business. Terms of the 
transaction were not disclosed. Harbor Payments is privately 
held.  When a company buys something from another business, it 
often receives a paper invoice, even if buying the item from a 
Web site. That paper invoice can take weeks for the buyer to 
process and pay.  Atlanta-based Harbor Payments' product allows sellers to 
electronically issue invoices, and buyers to pay them 
electronically, creating less bureaucracy and lowering 
processing costs for the parties involved, Ashish Bahl, chief 
executive of Harbor Payments, told Reuters in an interview.  American Express is entering this business to expand its 
offerings in business payment products, which include items 
like purchasing cards and travel and entertainment charge 
cards, said Gordon Smith, president of American Express Global 
Commercial Card.  U.S. businesses are estimated to sell some $15 trillion to 
$16 trillion of goods and services to other businesses a year, 
said Andrew Bartels, a research analyst at Forrester Research 
in Manhasset, New York.
