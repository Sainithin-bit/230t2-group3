 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The pace of growth in the dominant 
U.S. services sector accelerated unexpectedly in November, a 
report showed on Tuesday, confounding some concerns that it 
might contract as manufacturing did last month. 

  The Institute for Supply Management's services index rose 
to 58.9 in November from 57.1 in October. The median forecast 
of Wall Street economists was for a decline to 56.0. Gauges of 
employment, prices paid and new orders also rose.  A number above 50 indicates growth in the sector and the 
potential for a fall below that level in November was a focus 
of financial markets after last week's ISM manufacturing index 
posted its first sub-50 reading in 3-1/2 years.  A similar fall by the services index might have cemented 
the view of some investors that the Federal Reserve would have 
to cut interest rates early next year to shore up a softening 
U.S. economy.  "Reports of the demise of the economy may be premature," 
said Joel Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors in 
Holland, Pennsylvania.  "There are problems in manufacturing, housing and vehicles. 
People are still spending money. The rest of the economy is 
still doing okay."  Treasury bond prices fell in the wake of the 
stronger-than-expected services index. Benchmark 10-year notes 
US10YT=RR were trading 8/32 lower in price for a yield of 
4.46 percent.  The services sector makes up about 80 percent of U.S. 
economy activity, including businesses like restaurants, 
hotels, hair salons, banks and airlines. Eleven of 18 
non-manufacturing industries reported increased activity in 
November.  "The Fed's view that the economy is still healthy seems 
appropriate, said Gary Thayer, chief economist at A.G. Edwards 
and Sons in St. Louis, Missouri.  "It doesn't look as if the economy is faltering as the 
manufacturing index suggested last week."  The survey's prices-paid index posted a reading of 55.6 in 
November versus 51.9 in October, while the employment component 
came in at 51.6 from 51.0. New orders were at 57.1 from 56.5.
