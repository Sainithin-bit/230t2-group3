 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Top U.S. auto parts retailer AutoZone Inc. ( AZO.N ) said on Wednesday that quarterly earnings rose 8.3 percent as it trimmed costs, increased prices and widened its assortment of in-demand parts. 

 Net income increased to $123.9 million, or $1.73 per share, in the fiscal first quarter ended November 18, from $114.4 million, or $1.48 per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 4.1 percent to $1.39 billion. Analysts, on average, expected earnings of $1.68 per share on revenue of $1.39 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Memphis, Tennessee-based AutoZone, whose shares rose 2 percent, said sales at U.S. stores open at least a year, a key retail gauge known as same-store sales, rose 0.3 percent in the period. "AutoZone managed well in the fiscal first quarter despite a still struggling low-end consumer," said Credit Suisse analyst Gary Balter, who rated AutoZone shares "outperform." "The company continues to execute well to improve the top line, with higher pricing also helping," Balter said in a research note to clients. "We expect better results as the macro environment stabilizes." AutoZone bought back 816,000 shares in the quarter at an average of $111 per share, and had 70.7 million shares outstanding at the end of the period. It has about $130 million remaining under its current share repurchase authorization. Shares of AutoZone advanced $2.21 at $116.68 Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange. NO BENEFIT FROM LOWER GAS PRICES U.S. retail sales rose 3.9 percent to $1.17 billion, while sales to repair shops rose less than 1 percent to $160.7 million. Adjusted inventory per store was up to $503,000 from $495,000 a year earlier, mainly due to hard-parts categories that have been in demand by customers, AutoZone said. AutoZone, which had 3,912 stores at the end of the quarter, said it did not see an immediate benefit in sales from declining gasoline prices through the quarter, adding that other factors are more important. Declining gas prices benefited core lower-income customers, but they remained hesitant to make purchases, AutoZone said. AutoZone has improved customer service, floor presentation and hard-parts inventory, though it will take time for those improvements to have an impact on sales, it said. Argus Research analyst Kevin Tynan said AutoZone's strong results were helped by cost controls, but longer term he believes the sector will find it more difficult to increase same-store sales growth, especially to retail customers. "There is less and less do-it-yourself repair going on," said Tynan, who has a "sell" rating on AutoZone. "It is a lot easier to drop off the car and pick it up later as opposed to spending a weekend day doing these kinds of things yourself." "This is a trend that runs a little deeper than one or two sluggish quarters. It is a phenomena that is going to continue," Tynan said. Through Monday, AutoZone stock had risen nearly 25 percent this year, while the Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  gained about 13 percent.
