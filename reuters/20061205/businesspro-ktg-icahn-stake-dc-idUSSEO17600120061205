 SEOUL  (Reuters) - U.S. investor Carl Icahn sold shares 
worth $460 million in South Korea's top tobacco company KT&G 
Corp. ( 033780.KS ) at the bottom of the expected price range on 
Tuesday, sources familiar with the deal said. 

  Icahn had widely been expected to sell out of KT&G after 
the company said it would return up to $2.9 billion to 
shareholders under pressure from Icahn and one-time ally Warren 
Lichtenstein.  The news of the sale, which a source familiar with the deal 
said took place before Tuesday's market open, sent shares down 
by more than 4 percent, a day after the stock hit a record.  "The shares changed hands between foreign investors at 
60,700 won," another source, who declined to be identified, 
told Reuters by telephone, without naming the parties involved.  On Monday, a source close to the deal told Reuters Icahn 
was offering the KT&G shares, representing a 4.75 percent 
stake, in a block trade. The latest available data showed 
Icahn's funds owned 5.27 percent of KT&G.  The sale price, a 3.8 percent discount to Monday's closing 
price, brings the total sale value to 424.9 billion won ($458.2 
million). Icahn is set to post a capital gain of about $120 
million based on KT&G's estimates that Icahn's funds bought the 
bulk of their holdings at about 45,000 won a share.  The sale price was at the very low end of a 60,700 
won-62,500 won range previously quoted by sources.  Citigroup ( C.N ), the bookrunner for the sale, could not be 
reached for comment after the transaction.  The sale comes as shares in KT&G, which controls 72 percent 
of the world's seventh-largest cigarette market, hit a record 
high of 64,600 won on Monday. As of Monday's close, the stock 
had risen 40 percent so far this year, beating the wider Seoul 
market index's  .KS11  3.4 percent gain.  Icahn and Lichtenstein, who led a $10 billion hostile 
takeover bid for KT&G, ended an alliance in August, after the 
firm promised to return up to $2.9 billion to shareholders by 
2008, bringing its payout levels into line with peers Altria 
Group Inc. ( MO.N ) and British American Tobacco Plc. ( BATS.L ).  As of 0101 GMT, KT&G shares traded down 4.12 percent at 
60,500 won, against a 0.42 percent gain in the KOSPI.  ($1=927.3 Won)
