 MILAN  (Reuters) - Luxottica ( LUX.MI ) and Tiffany & Co 
( TIF.N ) have signed a 10-year agreement for Luxottica to make 
ophthalmic and sun glasses under the Tiffany name. 

  "The agreement marks Tiffany's entrance into the eyewear 
market, with the launch of the first-ever collections," the 
companies said in a joint statement on Tuesday.  Luxottica said it expected the line to generate annual 
revenues of at least 50 million euros ($66.60 million), but it 
did not give a timeline nor say how the revenues would be 
shared.
