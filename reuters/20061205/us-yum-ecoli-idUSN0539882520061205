 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Yum Brands Inc. on Tuesday said a strain of E. coli that is suspected to have sickened a number of people in the Northeast is no longer in any of its Taco Bell restaurants. 

 "The E. coli strain appears to have passed through our system," Tim Jerzyk, Yum's vice president of investor relations, said at a meeting with Wall Street analysts on Tuesday. Jerzyk added that there was "no immediate threat to consumers today" and said the company is continuing to work with health officials. Yum said on Monday that its Taco Bell chain had closed four restaurants in New York as a precautionary measure after a suspected E.coli outbreak at one of its New Jersey outlets sickened nearly a dozen people.
