 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. bankruptcy filings have fallen to a 10-year low after a tough new federal law made it more difficult for Americans to seek protection from creditors. 

 There were 1.113 million personal and business bankruptcies in the fiscal year ending September 30, down 37.6 percent from the record 1.783 million the prior year, data released Tuesday by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts show. Personal bankruptcies fell 37.9 percent to 1.085 million, while business bankruptcies declined 20.1 percent to 27,333. Fiscal year filings fell to the lowest level since the year ending September 1996. Filings declined because a law that took effect on October 17, 2005 boosted filing costs and requirements, and made it tougher for many individuals to have debts excused. The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act, championed by credit card issuers as a way to curb abuse, was the biggest U.S. bankruptcy law overhaul since 1978. A subcommittee of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to meet Wednesday to discuss the impact of the law. "I would expect the credit card industry to tout the decline in the filing rate as proof of some success in the law," said Robert Lawless, a professor at the University of Illinois College of Law, who is scheduled to testify at the hearing. Critics of the law have argued that most people file for bankruptcy protection not to escape debt, but because of job loss, divorce, medical bills, or high interest rates and fees. Many U.S. lenders have cautioned that loan losses are likely to rise as the economy matures and bankruptcy rates normalize. More than 600,000 of the year's filings were in the first 16 days of October 2005, as people rushed to beat the new law. The pace of filings is rebounding slowly. There were 171,146 filings from July to September, up 9.8 percent from the prior quarter, but down 68.4 percent from a year earlier, and less than half the roughly 400,000 quarterly rate for much of this decade. Data show the mix of filings has also changed. This is because people who earn more than the median income in their states and can repay some debts must now use Chapter 13, which requires debt repayments, rather than Chapter 7, which does not. About 60 percent of individuals now file under Chapter 7, down from 80 percent in the months leading up to the new law. Lawless said it is too soon to know whether filings will return to levels earlier this decade. "I don't think there is reason for them to return in the next 12 months," he said. "However, the amount of consumer credit and mortgage debt outstanding drives a lot of filings and those are rising, which means we're going to see bankruptcy filings rise." According to the Administrative Office, California had 85,223 bankruptcy filings in the year ending September 30. Ohio was next with 72,403, followed by Texas at 65,474, New York at 57,686 and Illinois at 57,023.
