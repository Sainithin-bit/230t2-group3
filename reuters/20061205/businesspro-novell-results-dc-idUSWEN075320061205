 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Business software maker Novell Inc. 
NOVL.O posted a preliminary quarterly profit on Tuesday, 
bouncing back from a year-earlier loss when it took a $38 
million restructuring charge. 

  It reported fiscal fourth-quarter net income available to 
common stockholders of $23.7 million, or 6 cents a share, 
compared with a loss of $5.0 million, or 1 cent, a year 
earlier.  Revenue fell 15 percent from a year earlier to $244.9 
million on weak sales of older products.  Wall Street was expecting revenue of $251.5 million, the 
average forecast of analysts polled by Reuters Estimates.  Full-year revenue fell to $967 million in the year ended 
October 31 from $1.04 billion in the previous year. The company 
told investors sales could fall again in the current year, 
which ends in October 2007.  Novell now expects fiscal 2007 revenue of between $945 
million and $975 million. Analysts forecasts range from $949 
million to $1.05 billion, with an average of $1.0 billion, 
according to Reuters Estimates.  "Overall these are disappointing results," said Jefferies & 
Co. analyst Katherine Egbert, citing the lower-than-expected 
fourth-quarter sales figure and the 2007 revenue forecast.  The software maker's shares fell 8 percent in after hours 
electronic trading, dropping to $5.80 from their Nasdaq close 
of $6.33.  Novell said the fourth-quarter results were preliminary 
because it is conducting a voluntary review of its historical 
stock options, which could lead to adjustments in its 
accounting.
