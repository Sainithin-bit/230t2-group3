 MELBOURNE  (Reuters) - John Fairfax Holdings Ltd. ( FXJ.AX ), 
Australia's second-biggest newspaper publisher, bid up to A$1.7 
billion ($1.3 billion) for regional media group Rural Press 
Ltd. RUP.AX, kicking off a long-awaited round of media 
takeovers. 

  Fairfax said Rural Press directors had unanimously 
recommended the bid in the absence of a better proposal, which 
is expected to boost Fairfax's earnings per share from the 2008 
financial year, excluding one-off integration costs.  "This merger positions the group tremendously for internet 
expansion," Fairfax chief executive David Kirk said in a 
statement on Wednesday.  Fairfax expects the merged group to save at least A$35 
million a year within 12 to 18 months.  Fairfax is offering A$3.30 in cash and two Fairfax shares 
for each Rural share or A$1.80 in cash and 2.3 Fairfax shares. 
In addition Rural Press will pay a special dividend of 57.143 
cents per ordinary share and 62.858 cents per preferred share.  Rural Press, a newspaper publisher with radio interests 
mainly in farming areas has long been touted as a target or 
suitor for Fairfax.  Fairfax itself is seen as one of the most likely takeover 
targets when new laws come into place in 2007 allowing owners 
of one media platform -- newspapers, television or radio -- to 
own another media platform in a single market.  Looking to block or influence the outcome of any takeover 
of Fairfax, its bigger rival, Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. 
NWS.N, bought a 7.5 percent stake in October, while 
broadcaster Seven Network Ltd. SEV.AX said this week it had 
bought a stake of less than 5 percent.  ($1=A$1.27)
