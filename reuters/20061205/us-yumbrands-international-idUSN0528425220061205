 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Fast-food company Yum Brands Inc. ( YUM.N ) said on Tuesday that half of its operating profit next year would come from restaurants outside the United States as it pursues growth in China and India. 

 The head of Yum's international business also said KFC and Pizza Hut should one day be as big as market leader McDonald's Corp. ( MCD.N ) internationally. "There is no reason why KFC can't be as big as McDonald's around the world," Graham Allan, president of Yum Restaurants International, said at a meeting with Wall Street analysts in New York. "We think about Pizza Hut in the same context." Yum has more than 11,700 restaurants in its international division, which excludes China, and expects to have 15,000 restaurants by 2011. In China, Yum has about 2,000 restaurants and has been opening about one a day and expects to have at least 20,000 restaurants in the world's most populous nation. Yum's China division now makes up nearly a third of its overall operating profit. In the United States, Yum operates more than 20,000 restaurants. Yum plans to expand its Taco Bell chain internationally and will begin testing the brand in India, the Middle East, Mexico and the Philippines next year, Allan said. "There is a huge pull for Taco Bell around the world," Allan said, adding that Yum would be investing "a significant amount of money" in 2007 to support the expansion of the Mexican-style chain outside the United States. The company also plans a large Taco Bell expansion in Canada. That announcement comes as several Taco Bell restaurants in the United States have been linked to an E.coli infection outbreak in New York and New Jersey that has sickened about 40 people in the last two weeks. The company also said that it will double its cash dividend to 30 cents per share payable on March 30. Yum made small efforts to expand Taco Bell, its most profitable U.S. brand, outside its home market. But Allan said those initiatives had been hampered by the lack of local supply chains and menu prices that were too high. This time prices on Taco Bell food will be lower in new markets, Allan said. Yum, based in Louisville, Kentucky, has been placing greater emphasis on its international businesses as its KFC and Pizza Hut brands have enjoyed growth in China, Western Europe and Russia. Meanwhile, the company's U.S. business has faced declining sales at restaurants open at least a year due in part to weak performance at Pizza Hut. The pizza delivery chain has been hard-hit by stiff competition from rivals Domino's Pizza Inc. ( DPZ.N ) and Papa John's International Inc. ( PZZA.O ) Yum Chief Executive David Novak said that while the company has no plans to make any acquisitions, any potential deal would have to have "an international runway." For that reason, Novak said Yum would not be interested in buying U.S. burger chain Wendy's International Inc. WEN.N. Wendy's has a small operation outside of the United States and Canada. Yum's U.S. same-store sales, a key retail measure, fell 2 percent in the third quarter and fell another 1 percent in October. In October, however, Yum raised its profit outlook for the year, citing strong performance in China and other international markets. Yum shares were up $1.60, or 2.6 percent, at $63.23 in early afternoon trade Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange.
