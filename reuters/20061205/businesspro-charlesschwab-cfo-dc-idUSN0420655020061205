 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Discount brokerage Charles Schwab 
Corp. SCHW.O said on Monday its earnings could hit $1 billion 
this year, or almost $100 million ahead of its plan. 

  Schwab Chief Financial Officer Chris Dodds said $1 billion 
in earnings are in the company's sights for 2006. He made his 
remarks during the San Francisco company's annual fall business 
update.  Dodds also said he sees asset management fees up 13 percent 
to $1.9 billion in 2007. In addition, he expects net new assets 
of $130 billion next year.
