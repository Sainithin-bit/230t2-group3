 LONDON  (Reuters) - U.S. defense firms Boeing Co. ( BA.N ) and 
Lockheed Martin Corp. ( LMT.N ) are in long-established talks 
with Saudi Arabia about supplying fighter aircraft, the 
Guardian newspaper said on Tuesday, citing unnamed industry 
sources. 

  Boeing and Lockheed were said to be in "ongoing 
conversations" with the Saudi authorities, it said.  British newspapers have reported that a deal between Saudi 
Arabia and Britain's BAE Systems BA.L for 72 Eurofighter 
Typhoon combat jets could be in jeopardy because of a fraud 
probe into suspected accounting regularities related to BAE.  A senior manager for Europe's largest defense firm, 
however, said on Saturday that BAE Systems was optimistic about 
the future of its business with Riyadh. BAE has repeatedly 
stated that it was cooperating fully with the Serious Fraud 
Office and believed that it had done nothing wrong.
