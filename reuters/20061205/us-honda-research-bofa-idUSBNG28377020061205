 (Reuters) - Banc of America Securities said Honda Motor Co. Ltd ( HMC.N ) was its top pick for 2007 in the autos sector, ahead of Toyota Motor Corp. ( TM.N ). 

 The brokerage cited Honda's upcoming new product pipeline, volume leverage and defensive nature. Banc of America also said it expects Honda's market share to rise 30 basis points to 50 basis points in next several years, up from the annual rate of 15 basis points. The brokerage said it continues to remain positive on Toyota, which is currently amid its new product rollout. Auto parts supplier TRW Automotive Holdings Corp. ( TRW.N ) was a second favorite due to the company's earnings quality compared to other suppliers, among other factors. The brokerage has a price target of $42 on Honda, $140 on Toyota and $33 on TRW. It has a "buy" rating on all three stocks. (Reporting by Jennifer Robin Raj in Bangalore)
