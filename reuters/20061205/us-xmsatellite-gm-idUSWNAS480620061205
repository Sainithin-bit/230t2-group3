 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - XM Satellite Radio Holdings Inc. XMSR.O on Tuesday said that automaker General Motors Corp.( GM.N ) plans to make over 1.8 million vehicles with the XM radio-service built-in in 2007. 

 Every GM vehicle with factory-installed XM radio includes a three-month trial service period. After that period, customers typically pay about $13 a month for the nationwide system, which features music, news, talk and sports channels, many of them commercial-free. XM and rival Sirius Satellite Radio Inc. ( SIRI.O ) see factory-installed units in millions of new cars as an important means of gaining new subscribers, and between them have signed deals with all the major car makers. In many cases, consumers can also have their choice of satellite service installed at a local dealer.
