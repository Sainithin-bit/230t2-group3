 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of Sirius Satellite Radio Inc. ( SIRI.O ) fell more than 7 percent on Tuesday after the pay-radio provider cut its fourth- quarter subscriber target, citing disappointing sales over the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday weekend. 

 Sirius late on Monday said it now expects to have 5.9 million to 6.1 million subscribers by year's end, down from its previous view of 6.3 million subscribers. In a statement, Sirius Chief Executive Mel Karmazin said retail sales results since the Thanksgiving weekend have not been at the pace the company had anticipated. The reduction spurred Bear Sterns analyst Robert Peck to cut its rating to "underperform" from "outperform." Karmazin said on November 30 at a Reuters media summit in New York that holiday sales, while strong at that point, might fall short of those a year earlier, when new subscribers flocked to join ahead of the launch of Stern's channels. "Retail environment continues to be weak," he said in a note to clients," noting the absence of Stern as a catalyst. He added that Sirius' automotive partners continue to lose market share to XM's Japanese partners, and that Sirius' partners are behind XM's in terms of deployment of radios. Morgan Joseph analyst David Kestenbaum also cut his view, lowering the rating to "hold" from "buy." Shares of bigger rival XM Satellite Radio Holdings Inc. XMSR.O also fell about 2 percent on Tuesday. XM's decline had been more than 5 percent, but narrowed after XM said it expects General Motors to make 1.8 million cars in 2007 with the XM service built-in. XM and Sirius see factory-installed units in millions of new cars as an important means of gaining new subscribers, and between them have signed deals with all the major car makers.
