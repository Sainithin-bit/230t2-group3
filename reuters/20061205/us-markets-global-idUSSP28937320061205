 LONDON  (Reuters) - Oil prices steadied on Tuesday after a $1 fall the previous day due to mild weather forecasts, while the yen gained broadly after a Bank of Japan policymaker signaled that interest rates could rise soon. 

 European stocks were higher, helped by corporate takeover speculation. Silver hit a fresh six-month high XAG=, though gold stalled below a key resistance level of $650 an ounce XAU=. Recent dollar weakness has helped boost the prices of precious metals by making them cheaper for non-U.S. buyers. Oil prices were steadying as the possibility of a further output cut by OPEC producers who meet next week was balanced by milder weather and expected strong fuel stockpiles in the United States. "OPEC has signaled that it would be cutting quota when they meet next week but I think the market is basically shrugging its shoulders because it doesn't expect a significant amount of supply to be offline," said Andrew Harrington, resource analyst at ANZ. "The inventory level is still very high, there is no reason to start panicking." U.S. crude was trading at around $62.63 a barrel CLc1 after falling nearly $1 on Monday. London's Brent crude was little changed on the day at $63.32 a barrel LCOc1. The lower oil prices put pressure on energy stocks, helping trim 0.23 percent off the value of Japan's Nikkei average   .N225 . In Europe, FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  climbed half a percent to 1,437.78 points. Among gainers in London, Vodafone ( VOD.L ) was up 1.9 percent after Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock. U.S. stock futures were pointing to a firmer start on Wall Street later. EYEING EUROPEAN RATE HIKES So far, European companies seem to have weathered the stronger euro, which hit 20-month highs against the dollar  EUR=  and record peaks versus the yen EURJPY= on Monday. A stronger than expected reading in the euro zone services sector survey on Tuesday reinforced expectations that the European Central Bank will raise interest rates this week and might move again in early 2007. Euro zone government bonds extended losses after the data. The March Euribor futures contract FEIH7, a gauge of short-term euro zone interest rate expectations, was down three basis point at 96.225. "Overall, the reacceleration in euro zone services growth strengthens the case for ECB rate rises beyond the 25 basis point move planned for Thursday," said Martin van Vliet, economist at ING. In Japan, rate hike expectations were given a boost after BOJ Policy Board member Atsushi Mizuno said it would be wrong to think the central bank needed to wait until all economic indicators were strong to raise interest rates again. The yen gained half a percent versus the euro EURJPY= and hit a four-month high of 114.67 per dollar  JPY= . Later, investors will look to the U.S. Institute for Supply Management's non-manufacturing gauge for November for clues on whether growth in the world's largest economy is slowing sufficiently to necessitate interest rate cuts in 2007.
