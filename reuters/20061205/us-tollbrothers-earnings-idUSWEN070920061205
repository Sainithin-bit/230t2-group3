 BOSTON/NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Luxury home builder Toll Brothers Inc. ( TOL.N ) reported a 44 percent drop in quarterly profit on Tuesday but signaled that the worst may be over for the sagging U.S. housing market. 

 Hopes for an end to the long decline in housing sent Toll shares up 3.5 percent, even as the company forecast further profit declines in the new fiscal year. "We may be seeing a floor in some markets where deposits and traffic, although erratic from week to week, seem to be dancing on the bottom or slightly above," Chief Executive Robert Toll said in a statement. The executive, one of the first leaders in the home-building sector to report a slowing in certain hot markets in the summer of 2005, said conditions appeared to be stabilizing in Washington's northern Virginia suburbs. "That's the key here," said BB&T Capital Markets analyst Jack Kasprzak. "That's what everyone wants to see -- some sign that the market's stabilizing." After several strong years, the U.S. housing market has deteriorated sharply as interest rates have risen and soaring prices have chased would-be buyers out of the market. For the fiscal fourth quarter ended October 31, Toll profit fell to $173.8 million, or $1.07 per share, from $310.3 million, or $1.84 per share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected $1.06 per share. Revenue, which reflects completed sales, fell to $1.81 billion from $2.02 billion. The value of new contracts signed during the quarter fell 56 percent. The number of new contracts was down 32.7 percent from the third quarter, a slightly bigger drop than the 32.5 percent decline from the second quarter to the third. REASON FOR OPTIMISM? "It's one thing to say that the markets are stabilizing and that maybe we've hit bottom," Kasprzak said. "For a cyclical industry that's very important. "Feeling like it's not getting worse is typically a sign for investors to consider buying stocks in that industry." However, bottoming does not necessarily signal a return to the heady days of 2004 and 2005. "I think that's unlikely," Kasprzak said. Citing the uncertain market conditions, D.R. Horton Inc. ( DHI.N ), the largest U.S. home builder, last month declined to offer investors a financial forecast for 2007. Toll shares were up $1.11 to $33.02 near midday on the New York Stock Exchange. So far this year, the shares have fallen 5 percent, compared with a 19 percent slide in the Dow Jones U.S. Home Construction Index .DJUSHB. The index was up 2.6 percent near midday. Toll shares have rallied more than 49 percent from their year low of $22.22 in July. The Horsham, Pennsylvania-based company said it expected earnings of $1.58 to $2.08 a share for fiscal 2007. The outlook includes the impact of a change of accounting method which the company anticipates will shift earnings of 22 cents to 29 cents a share from 2007 to subsequent years. The forecast also includes an estimated $60 million of pretax land-related write-downs -- above the $16 million Toll has budgeted annually in recent years -- due to uncertain market conditions.
