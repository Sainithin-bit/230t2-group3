 TEL AVIV  (Reuters) - EMC Corp. ( EMC.N ), the world's largest computer storage company, plans to be more active in Israel following a spate of acquisitions of Israeli companies, a senior executive said on Tuesday. 

 "We want to be more proactive in Israel," Thomas Heiser, senior vice president of corporate development and new ventures, told a news conference in Tel Aviv. "We have been very active and will be more active." In 2006, EMC acquired three Israeli companies: business software maker ProActivity Software Solutions, application discovery and mapping software maker nLayers, and Kashya, a maker of data replication and protection software. In addition, it bought digital security company RSA Security Inc., which had acquired Israel's Cyota Inc., a maker of online security software, in December 2005. EMC spent over $300 million on its Israeli acquisitions and now employs 250 people in research and development in Israel and 100 in sales. Heiser met Israeli venture capital firms (VCs) and the company has decided that, in addition to acquisitions, it will make strategic investments in Israeli start-ups alongside the VCs. EMC already works closely with VCs in San Francisco and Boston and the company plans to do the same with VCs in Israel, Heiser said. EMC will also expand research and development in Israel, said Heiser, although he could not say what percentage of the company's R&D is done in Israel. EMC, which is best known for data-storage hardware, has spent $7 billion on acquisitions in the past three years. In 2006, it bought 11 companies for $2.7 billion, including $2.1 billion for RSA. EMC also spent $1.2 billion on research and development in 2006 and $3 billion in the past three years. The company is looking to diversify its business by boosting sales of computer software as well as information technology services. It is now the seventh largest software company with $3.5 billion in software sales in 2005, Heiser said. EMC's total revenue in 2006 is expected by analysts to reach $11.1 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. That is up from $9.6 billion in 2005. Heiser said EMC was now focusing on five areas: storage, visualization, content management, security and resource management. EMC would consider moving into new areas. "We're always looking at new areas," Heiser said. But for now the company's main focus will be on making its recent acquisitions successful. Heiser could not say how much EMC would spend on acquisitions in 2007. "It depends. We're flexible. We don't have a special budget for this," he said, noting that company was now drawing up its 2007 strategy, which will be reviewed by the board in five weeks. The company had about $5.5 billion in cash on its books as of the end of September, according to its most recent financial statements. Heiser also said that plans to cut 1,250 jobs, or 4 percent of its work force, by the end of 2007 to integrate its acquisitions would not affect its Israeli operations. EMC shares rose 17 cents to $13.53 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. (Additional reporting by  Jim Finkle  in Boston.)
