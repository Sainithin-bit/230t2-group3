 PARIS  (Reuters) - Sanofi-Aventis's Acomplia pill can significantly improve blood sugar levels in patients with type 2 diabetes while also reducing their weight, clinical trial data sponsored by the French drugmaker showed on Tuesday. 

 The data from Sanofi's first non-obesity trial with Acomplia help support the company's aim to position Acomplia as a drug that does more than help overweight people shed kilos, improving prospects for reimbursement, analysts said. Sanofi shares closed 3.04 percent higher at 67.85 euros, having increased by as much as 3.3 percent and taking the stock's losses to 8.9 percent this year. Acomplia, which Sanofi sees as a potential $3 billion-a-year seller, is already being prescribed as an anti-obesity drug in several countries but is still awaiting U.S. marketing approval. The six-month study involved 278 patients with type 2 diabetes who were not taking any diabetic drugs. In this most common form of the disease, chiefly linked to obesity, the body cannot regulate the insulin hormone the body needs to use sugar. The trial, named Serenade, showed that HbA1c blood sugar levels in patients on a once-daily 20 mg Acomplia pill fell 0.8 percentage points from their baseline value of 7.9 percent against a drop of 0.3 points in those taking a placebo. More significantly, Sanofi said, patients with a blood sugar level of at least 8.5 percent at baseline saw their blood sugar level decrease 1.9 percentage points when taking Acomplia, or rimonabant, compared with 0.7 points in patients on a placebo. "It is extraordinary that in this last group -- about 25 percent of the participants -- rimonabant was as efficient as several of the best anti-diabetic treatments," said Marc Cluzel, Sanofi's head of international development, scientific and medical affairs. The blood sugar level in more than half of the patients on Acomplia fell to below 7 percent -- the target that the American Diabetes Association sees as good glucose control -- and they lost 6.7 kg of their weight, against 2.7 kg among those on a placebo. Many diabetic drugs lead to weight gains. "This is a welcome finding that has tremendous potential for further studies in Type 2 diabetes. These findings open a door to a new approach in the management of Type 2 diabetes," said Julio Rosenstock, an investigator on the Serenade trial and head of the Dallas Diabetes and Endocrine Center. The trial data showed that patients' waist circumference, which measures abdominal obesity, shrank 6.1 cm if they took Acomplia, compared with 2.4 cm for those on a placebo. Those on Acomplia also benefited from improved good HDL cholesterol and lower bad fat levels in the blood. SIDE EFFECTS "This (the trial) helps them to say, 'This is a proper drug, not just an anti-obesity drug'," said Nomura Code analyst Paul Diggle. Acomplia cut blood sugar levels by more than he had estimated, but its side effects were worse than he had hoped. The rate of patients leaving the trial before it had finished due to adverse effects -- including dizziness, nausea, anxiety, depressed mood and headache -- was 9.4 percent for those on Acomplia and 2.1 percent for those on placebo. Acomplia is a key product for Sanofi, the world's third-largest drugmaker which is fighting off government healthcare cuts and increasing rivalry from cheaper generics. Douglas Greene, Sanofi's chief medical officer in the United States, told a conference call the company was examining when it would submit the new data to health authorities but declined to speculate how and when it would affect the prescription label. He declined to comment on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) ongoing assessment of the drug. Sanofi aims to position Acomplia, which switches off the same brain circuits that make people hungry when they smoke cannabis, to help treat obesity-related ailments such as heart conditions linked to blood pressure and high cholesterol. For Bryan Garnier analyst Julien Dormois, the results showed Acomplia could be used as a complement to anti-diabetic drugs or "as a first tool" for patients who are beginning to suffer from ailments linked to overweight or obesity. Sanofi's previous one-year RIO diabetes trial, published in 2005, focused on obese and overweight patients with type 2 diabetes already being treated with an anti-diabetic. In Serenade, 5 percent of the patients were not obese or overweight and none of the participants had been on any anti-diabetics. In several European countries Acomplia is approved for use along with diet and exercise to treat people who are obese or overweight and who also have diabetes or high cholesterol. In Mexico it may also be prescribed as a complement to other anti-diabetics to improve blood sugar. (Additional reporting by  Andrew Quinn  in Cape Town)
