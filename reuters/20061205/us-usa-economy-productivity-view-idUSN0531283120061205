 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The productivity of U.S. workers rose by a weaker-than-expected 0.2 percent in the third quarter, while unit labor costs grew by less than initially thought in encouraging news for the Federal Reserve on wage pressures, government data showed on Tuesday. 

 Nonfarm business productivity was forecast by analysts polled by Reuters to mount 0.4 percent, compared with zero growth initially reported by the Labor Department, and a 1.2 percent increase in the second quarter.   KEY POINTS: - Compensation per hour increased 2.6 percent, versus a 1.2 percent decline in the previous three months, helping restrain unit labor cost growth to 2.3 percent, the Labor Department reported.  COMMENTARY:  JASON BONANCA, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST, CREDIT SUISSE, NEW YORK: "Inflation has been quite high even though the market has been obsessively focused on housing and other downside risks like the ISM. "The one big impediment to the already well-priced easing actually materializing is inflation providing concrete indication that it is not going to continue to rise and you have something like this ... and that is an enormous dip and that is enormously reassuring to those people who were hoping that we would have some kind of confirmation that inflation is going to slow down and enable, if you will, the Federal Reserve to ease."  RICK KLINGMAN, HEAD TRADER, U.S. TREASURY DESK, ABN AMRO, NEW YORK: "Very bullish (for bonds) ... unit labor cost productivity is one of the things people were concerned about a little more than a month ago. Now we've seen, after the GDP revision and now this, that the labor cost picture isn't nearly as scary as we thought. "We're not in the camp that the Fed is going to ease but it definitely bolsters those who are really worried about growth. ... One of the impediments of the Fed to actually reversing course was the labor cost picture. It's definitely a bullish number (for bonds)."  OWEN FITZPATRICK, HEAD OF U.S. EQUITY GROUP, DEUTSCHE BANK PRIVATE WEALTH MANAGEMENT, NEW YORK: "Both came in (below estimates), but that is a positive for the market. The unit labor costs should probably outweigh the disappointing productivity number, and that should take some pressure off the Fed."  CHRISTOPER LOW, CHIEF ECONOMIST, FTN FINANCIAL, NEW YORK: "The bad news is that productivity growth is smaller than expected, but the good news is that unit labor costs were revised lower than expected. "It's important that the Fed is well aware that the economy is slowing but they need to know that the slowdown is taking pressure off inflation. Hopefully this is what they will take from this report."  MARKET REACTION: - U.S. Treasury debt prices rise after sharper-than-expected downward revisions to Q3 unit labor costs. Dollar slips after Q3 unit labor costs revised down, productivity less than expected. U.S. stock index futures rise after productivity, wage inflation data.
