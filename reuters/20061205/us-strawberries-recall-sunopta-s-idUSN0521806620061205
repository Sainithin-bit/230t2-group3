 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A unit of SunOpta Inc. said it was recalling frozen strawberries used in U.S. smoothie drinks because they may have been contaminated with an organism that can sometimes trigger fatal infections in young children. 

 SunOpta's Cleugh's Frozen Foods Inc. in Salinas, California on Mondy announced a voluntary recall of frozen strawberries sold exclusively to Jamba Juice. The strawberries were sold to Jamba Juice stores in Arizona, Nevada and Southern California between November 25 and December 1. In a separate announcement, Jamba Inc. said it halted all shipments from the location where the Listeria was found and removed all strawberries provided by the production facility. To date, no confirmed illnesses have been reported by customers to either Jamba Juice's consumer help line or store management, Jamba added. The recall was initiated because of concern that the strawberries may have been contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes, SunOpta said in press release. To date no suspected illnesses have been reported, SunOpta said. The recalled products have been removed from the Jamba Juice stores. Jamba chief executive Paul Clayton said in a letter to customers to be issued later on Tuesday, which was made available to Reuters, that most of the identified shipments were recovered before they were ever unpacked, although some of the contaminated strawberries may have been used in a limited number of stores. In an interview, he said it was difficult to say how many stores may have used the strawberries, but he estimated that there could be 170-180 Jamba stores at risk. Clayton said out of the strawberries received, Jamba had accounted for all but about 40-60 cases -- which may have been used. Each case contains about 30 lbs of strawberries, he said, although it was hard to say how many smoothies may have been made from the fruit, as different smoothie recipes made in the stores use varying amounts of ingredients. Jamba said its helpline number was 1-877-464-5689.
