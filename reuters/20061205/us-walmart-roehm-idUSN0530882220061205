 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s ( WMT.N ) head of marketing communications, who led a recent switch to a new advertising agency, has left the company, the world's biggest retailer said on Tuesday. 

 Wal-Mart spokeswoman Mona Williams said Julie Roehm left the company earlier this week, along with Sean Womack, who was vice president of marketing communications. She declined to comment further. Advertising Age reported earlier on Tuesday that Roehm had left. She had been with the company for less than one year. Roehm's departure comes weeks after Wal-Mart awarded its advertising account to agencies owned by Interpublic Group of Cos. Inc. ( IPG.N ) and Aegis Group Plc AGS.L.
