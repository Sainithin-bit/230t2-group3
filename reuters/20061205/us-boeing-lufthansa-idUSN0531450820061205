 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Germany's Lufthansa ( LHAG.DE ) could announce as soon as Wednesday that it will order the passenger version of Boeing Co.'s ( BA.N ) updated 747 jumbo jet at the expense of Airbus, its usual supplier, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday. 

 Citing unnamed sources, the newspaper reported on its Web site that the company could order 20 planes and take options for 20 more, with each order being worth $5 billion at list prices. U.S.-based Boeing was not immediately available for comment. A spokeswoman for Lufthansa said the airline had made no decision and declined to comment on a timeline for a deal. Boeing and pan-European Airbus are keen competitors, with EADS' ( EAD.PA ) Airbus lagging Boeing in orders for the first time in five years, according to recent Airbus figures. Boeing shares were up 1.4 percent or $1.27 at $90.85 by mid-afternoon on Tuesday in New York.
