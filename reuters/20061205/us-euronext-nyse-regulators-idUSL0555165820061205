 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - Euronext ENXT.PA and NYSE NYX.N won endorsement for their $14 billion merger from European regulators on Tuesday, removing a major hurdle for the first transatlantic stock exchange. 

 Euronext, whose shares rose more than 3 percent after the announcement, in June accepted a merger proposal from the NYSE Group, parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, in a deal now worth $14.2 billion based on current share prices. Both companies say it is a merger of equals. Merger talk between major exchanges has been swirling since earlier this year, as stock exchanges around the globe face pressure to consolidate to cut costs and increase execution speed. As bourses demutualise from member-only clubs to publicly traded companies, investor demand in the sector has been high. "We can at this point confirm that we as the college of Euronext regulators are not minded to object to the proposal for the Euronext NYSE combination," the regulators said in a letter to Euronext Chairman Jean-Francois Theodore. Their agreement had been expected. Theodore said recently the groups were close to obtaining agreement for the deal from the U.S. Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) and European regulators. Rabo Securities analyst Thomas Nagtegaal said he did not expect Euronext's shareholders to object because of the higher bid value and the lack of a rival bid. Euronext shareholders will receive 21.32 euros plus the equivalent of 0.98 of a NYSE Group share for every Euronext share. "The merger now is a done deal," Nagtegaal said. A vote on the merger by shareholders is scheduled in two weeks, after which the committee of Euronext regulators will confirm its decision provided the terms of the merger remain intact. Shares in Euronext rose 4.1 percent to 88.75 euros at 1600 GMT having touched a high of 88.90 euros after the news. NYSE Group's shares rose as much as 5.9 percent in New York in early trade and were up 3.8 percent at $99.73. The European regulators also said they were working with the SEC on a memorandum of understanding for coordinated regulation and supervision of the Euronext-NYSE group, to be signed when the merger receives required approvals and the merger offer is unconditional. The merger is on track to be completed in the first quarter of 2007 after all approvals have been obtained, a spokesman for Euronext said, adding that the regulators' decision was a positive signal. VOTE Euronext board member Olivier Lefebvre said last week that he expects Euronext shareholders to vote in favor of the merger at an extraordinary meeting on December 19. NYSE shareholders will vote on the merger on December 20. The endorsement from regulators on Tuesday makes it more likely that Euronext and NYSE will forge the first merger between two big stock exchanges. Germany's Deutsche Boerse ( DB1Gn.DE ) had also sought a merger with Euronext, but scrapped plans last month. Nasdaq Stock Markets Inc. ( NDAQ.O ) is trying to take over the London Stock Exchange ( LSE.L ), which had rebuffed previous takeover approaches from rivals such as Deutsche Boerse, Euronext, Australia's Macquarie Bank MBL.AX and a previous attempt by Nasdaq. Euronext and NYSE have proposed to put their European operations -- which include the Paris, Amsterdam, Lisbon and Brussels bourses, and London's Euronext.Liffe derivatives market under the management of a Dutch foundation to keep them out of reach of U.S. rules such as the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation. "The road to the merger is pretty clear," said Ivo Luiten, analyst at IRIS research institute, adding that shareholders would be likely to be in favor of the merger if Euronext can convince them that American regulations would not apply to European companies.
