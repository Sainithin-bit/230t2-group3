 LONDON  (Reuters) - French Prime Minister Francois Fillon said on Thursday that euro zone members, especially France and Germany, were ready to do "absolutely everything" for the bloc's economic stability. 

 "The euro zone members, and especially France and Germany, are ready do everything ... absolutely everything to ensure the stability of the euro zone," he said during a visit to meet British Prime Minister David Cameron in London. Fillon said the global economic recovery was not sustainable without better economic and financial regulation, something that Paris would strive for during its presidency of this year's G20. "The global economic recovery cannot be sustained without better economic and financial regulation," he said. (Reporting by  Patrick Vignal ; Writing by  John Irish ; Editing by  Catherine Bremer )
