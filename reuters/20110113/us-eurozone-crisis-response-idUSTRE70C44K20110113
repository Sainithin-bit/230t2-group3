 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Euro zone nations are working on a "comprehensive package" to solve the bloc's debt crisis and agreement could be reached by February or March, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said this week. 

 A wide range of proposed steps is expected to be discussed by a regular meeting of euro zone finance ministers on Monday. Official euro zone sources say the package may be agreed at a summit of European Union leaders on February 4, or at their March summit at the latest. Below are ideas being floated by the region's policymakers. Official euro zone sources say no decisions have yet been taken on any of them. INCREASING EFSF'S EFFECTIVE LENDING CAPACITY The nominal lending capacity of the European Financial Stability Facility, the euro zone's bailout fund, is 440 billion euros, but because of a complex guarantee system that secures a triple A credit rating, the special purpose vehicle has an effective lending capacity of only around 250 billion euros. The European Commission and several euro zone countries would like to see the effective lending capacity boosted to the full 440 billion euros. The change could be approved at the February 4 summit, Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said, if other euro zone countries take the proposal on board. Partly because of public discontent within Germany over aid to indebted euro zone states, German officials have insisted no expansion of the EFSF is necessary. Raising the EFSF's effective capacity would require euro zone states to increase their guarantees for the facility's borrowing, forcing some governments to seek fresh approval from their parliaments. But Germany might agree to raising the effective capacity to 440 billion euros in exchange for stronger commitments to fiscal discipline from other euro zone states. Some analysts believe the EFSF's nominal size needs to be doubled or tripled to reassure markets, but this would be much more controversial for European governments and such proposals are not on the table now, an official euro zone source said. An overhaul of the EFSF is likely irrespective of whether Portugal is forced to ask for an international bailout, euro zone sources said. The idea of issuing joint euro zone bonds to help weak borrowers obtain money more cheaply, which was aired by some officials last year, appears unlikely to be discussed seriously in coming weeks. This is because Germany has opposed the idea and governments are focusing instead on reforming the EFSF. LOWERING THE PENALTY MARGIN ON EFSF LOANS The EFSF now charges a penalty margin of 300 basis points on top of the interest rate at which it lends money to governments frozen out of debt markets, plus a one-off 50 bp fee. The margin, which is paid up front by diminishing the size of the loan payout, helps secure the cash that serves as collateral for EFSF borrowing, and allows the top credit rating. It also serves as a deterrent to fiscal indiscipline, making borrowing from the EFSF so painful that it is a last resort. But EFSF loans are so costly for recipients that economists argue they diminish the chances of countries recovering economically and regaining sustainable debt positions. Some officials are therefore proposing that the penalty margin be lowered. It is not clear how large any reduction might be, but investment bank JP Morgan said in a research paper that to make the debts of Greece and Ireland sustainable after 2013, the European Union needed to extend its emergency lending at a rate of about 100 bps above German Bunds. ALLOWING THE EFSF TO BUY GOVERNMENT BONDS The EFSF currently raises money on the market through bond issuance and lends it on to governments at higher interest in exchange for tough fiscal reforms by those countries. This means the EFSF steps in only at the crisis stage, when the costs of borrowing for a government have risen so much that they are no longer sustainable. One proposal is for the EFSF to be allowed to buy the government bonds of a troubled country from the secondary market, in a program similar to the European Central Bank's bond-buying scheme. This could provide buying support at an earlier stage and cap yield rises, giving countries more time to avoid full-blown crises. It could also prove less costly for governments receiving aid than a full-blown bailout. However, this proposal is particularly controversial and would be politically difficult to justify in countries including Germany. A euro zone source said he did not expect any consensus on the idea to be reached at the meeting on Monday. The European Union executive has suggested allowing the planned European Stability Mechanism, which will replace the EFSF in 2013, to buy government bonds. But this would likely be done under strict conditions to limit the mechanism's exposure and ensure beneficiary states undertook reforms. FLEXIBLE CREDIT LINE Another idea is to let the EFSF extend a credit line to an at-risk country in a scheme modeled on the International Monetary Fund's flexible credit line, which has been provided to Poland, Mexico and Colombia. Like the IMF line, this would be a precautionary credit line to reassure investors that money was at hand for a country which had a fundamentally sound economy and policies, but which could find itself temporarily under stress from the markets. MORE REFORMS IN PORTUGAL A euro zone source said that if Portugal had to pay significantly more than 7.0 percent on its 10-year bonds, it would probably be forced to ask for EU/IMF aid. Lisbon sold 10-year bonds on Wednesday at an average yield of 6.716 percent, reducing immediate pressure for a bailout. But given continued uncertainty about Portugal's weak economy, fresh action by Lisbon to cut its budget deficit may well have to be part of any resolution of the euro zone crisis. A euro zone source said Portugal was likely to come under pressure from euro zone finance ministers at Monday's meeting to sign up to a contingency plan for more structural reforms and fiscal consolidation, to be implemented if there are slippages in its current targets for consolidation. MORE REFORMS, BANK TRANSPARENCY IN SPAIN Since Spain would be next in the markets' sights if Portugal were to seek a bailout, and the size of the fourth biggest euro zone economy would stretch current rescue funds to the limit, euro zone policymakers have been discussing ways for Madrid to further ease market concerns about its finances. These include the possibility of more structural reforms to the Spanish economy; further fiscal consolidation; tougher and more transparent stress tests of Spanish banks; and more action to recapitalize Spanish banks. BANK STRESS TESTS The European Union plans to conduct a new round of bank stress tests, with tougher conditions and possibly more transparency, over the next few months to establish the potential losses of banks and their recapitalization needs. If the tests are seen as credible by investors, they will reduce uncertainty about how much money some euro zone governments might need to support their banking systems. Regional stress tests published last July initially reassured the markets but the positive effect faded after Irish banks, which had done well in the tests, ran into serious trouble. FISCAL, ECONOMIC POLICIES Euro zone officials are expected to continue discussing ideas for closer cooperation among euro zone governments in fiscal, economic and social policies. By cooperation, however, ministers generally mean earlier and more comprehensive exchanges of information about their policies -- not subjecting their national policies to approval by other governments. Germany wants countries to strengthen their commitment to fiscal discipline and could press for this in exchange for concessions in other areas. Ideally, Berlin would like its euro zone partners to imitate the German "debt brake" law which came into effect this year, forcing the country to cut its structural budget deficit to 0.35 percent of gross domestic product by 2016.
