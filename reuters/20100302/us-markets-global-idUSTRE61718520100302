 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Global equities rose on Tuesday, with the main U.S. share index fully erasing 2010 losses on growing expectations debt-stricken Greece will secure financial aid, while Britain's pound floundered over political worries and public debt. 

 U.S. and euro zone government bond prices slipped as optimism that Greece would announce new austerity measures and win European Union financial support undermined the bonds' safe-haven allure. World stocks as measured by MSCI .MIWD00000PUS rose almost 1 percent, with all global markets, including emerging markets, trading higher. The European Commission said Greece must take additional measures to reach its deficit reduction target of 4 percent of gross domestic product in 2010. It said the Greek government was united and determined to do what was necessary to reach that target. "The market believes that Greece is going to be resolved," said Paul Mendelsohn, chief investment strategist at Windham Financial Services in Charlotte, Vermont. "You are not going to get the worst-case scenario. This is probably going to be kicked down the road into the future." Tuesday's advance pushed the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  into positive territory for 2010, a day after two other major U.S. indexes topped the break-even mark for the year. Merger activity helped set the tone after CF Industries Holdings Inc ( CF.N ) upped its hostile bid for Terra Industries Inc TRA.N to $47.40 per share in cash and stock. Terra shares rose 11.3 percent to $45.88 while CF shares dropped 2 percent to $105.31. While equity markets are generally higher, they are struggling to sustain the rebound from January. Many shares are still in the red for this year and managers have toned down expectations for gains after last year's powerful rallies. Wealth manager Sarasin said in a note that the rally is likely to continue but with corrections, prompting it to take some money off the table. "Since the risks of setbacks are gradually increasing, we would use strong market phases to further reduce our equity positions," it said. European equity markets in particular remain skittish about the state of euro zone finances, with Greece and other member states struggling to come to grips with ballooning debt. "Earnings in general have been on the right side of things. But what is still going on in the background is the Greece issue," said Bernard McAlinden, market strategist at NCB Stockbrokers in Dublin. In New York, the Dow industrials rose 31.74 points, or 0.31 percent, to 10,435.53. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  climbed 5.63 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,121.34 and the Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  gained 11.32 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,284.89. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  rose 0.76 percent and Japan's Nikkei  .N225  gained half a percent. POUND SLIDES Some focus within Europe shifted to Britain, where a general election to be called in the first half of the year was creating uncertainty about attempts to fix the country's public finances. Sterling came under pressure, falling half a percent to a session low of $1.4853 before recovering to $1.4950. On Monday, it slumped to a 10-month low of $1.4780. Although it later trimmed some losses, it still finished the day down 1.7 percent for its biggest one-day percentage fall in more than four months. Investors worry that the election may give neither the opposition Conservatives nor the ruling Labor Party a parliamentary majority, leading to a political stalemate. In other currency trading, the dollar was little changed against a basket of major trading-partner currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index .DXY down 0.02 percent at 80.642. The euro rose 0.08 percent to $1.3571, bouncing from a 9-1/2-month low hit earlier as investors awaited Greece's austerity plans. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar slipped 0.11 percent to 88.99 yen. Speculation that the EU would resolve Greece's fiscal situation and strength in stocks led traders to pare safe-haven bets on government debt. Yields on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes rose 0.01 percentage point to 3.62 percent. In energy and commodities trading, U.S. light sweet crude oil rose $1.51, or 1.92 percent, to $80.21 per barrel, and spot gold prices rose $16.00, or 1.43 percent, to $1132.90.
