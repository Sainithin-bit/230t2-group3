 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Dow Chemical Co ( DOW.N ) is selling its Styron basic plastics unit to private equity firm Bain Capital Partners for $1.63 billion. 

 The sale of the unit, which makes latex, rubber and related plastics, will help the nation's largest chemical maker further bolster its balance sheet following the $15 billion acquisition of Rohm and Haas last year. Dow had net debt of $19.5 billion at the end of 2009. The deal also helps Dow move away from commodity chemicals and lets it focus more on the higher-margin specialty chemical sector. The $1.63 billion price was higher than some analysts had expected. Morgan Stanley's Paul Mann had forecast $1.2 billion. He expects the deal to have "minimal impact" on Dow's earnings. Shares of Dow rose 30 cents to $28.99 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Bain bid in the second round of the auction for Styron, alongside buyout firms TPG TPG.UL and Apollo Management APOLO.UL, sources previously told Reuters. Reuters had reported that Bain was about to strike a deal. From the beginning, Styron attracted mostly private equity buyers, which were interested in the unit's cyclical business and deep connection to basic economic fundamentals. But the auction was a complex one because Dow has numerous contracts with the unit as both a supplier and a customer. Midland, Michigan-based Dow said it will have an option to retain a 15 percent stake in Styron. The deal also includes $400 million in supply agreements, where Dow will feed Styron the materials needed to produce its plastics. The deal is expected to close by August. Based on 2009 data, Styron is forecast to have $3.5 billion in annual revenue. Even though the deal will help Dow cull debt, BB&T Capital Markets analyst Frank Mitsch kept a "hold" rating on the stock, saying he is worried integration issues and additional capacity about to come online from competitors could hamper near-term earnings. Styron has a large presence in Belgium but also has several locations elsewhere in Europe and in Asia and Latin America. Dow has said it is targeting sales of $2 billion in nonstrategic assets this year. Last week it said it had a "contingency plan" if it was not able to reach that target. Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ) and HSBC ( HSBA.L ) advised Dow on the Styron deal. Bain's purchase of Styron is the largest private equity deal this year, beating out Kohlberg Kravis Roberts' KKR.UL $1.54 billion acquisition of UK-based Pets at Home in January, according to Thomson Reuters Deals Intelligence.
