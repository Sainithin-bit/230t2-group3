 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Donald Kohn said on Monday he will leave the central bank when his term as no. 2 expires in late June. 

 Kohn's departure leaves President Barack Obama wider scope to name policy-makers who will influence when the Fed raises interest rates and how aggressively it takes on its post-financial crisis regulatory responsibilities. With mid-term elections a possible referendum on his administration, Obama may aim for a Fed that quickly reduces unemployment and clamps down on risky financial practices. But he must avoid rattling markets with nominees seen as giving insufficient weight to preventing inflation. The White House said it will move quickly and will have a new vice chairman confirmed before Kohn's term ends in late June. In addition to replacing Kohn as the Fed's no. 2 official, the president must fill two long-vacant seats on the Fed's Board of Governors. Following are possible nominees according to analysts. CHRISTINA ROMER Romer is currently chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers. A University of California, Berkeley economics professor before joining the Obama administration, Romer, has written about the Great Depression and about the impact of tax policy on economic growth. A nominee closely associated with the White House could face stiff Republican opposition. DANIEL TARULLO A current Fed governor, Tarullo was Obama's first appointee to the central bank's board. A lawyer with a background in bank regulation, Tarullo could satisfy pressures to make the Fed a tougher financial oversight agency. His close links to the administration may raise nervousness about his commitment to hold inflation at bay while unemployment rates remain high. May prefer to focus on supervision issues rather than take on the no. 2 portfolio. JANET YELLEN Now San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank president, Yellen chaired the White House Council of Economic Advisers in the Clinton administration. A former Fed governor, Yellen would be the first woman to serve as Fed vice chair. Her familiarity with the Fed system and how markets react to it is a plus; her reputation as an unemployment-emphasizing "dove" might weigh against her. BRIAN MADIGAN The Fed's director of the division of monetary affairs. A staffer at the Fed for close to 27 years, Madigan has followed a similar path to Kohn's, working his way to a job that puts him at the center of policy-making and forecasting. Carrying no political baggage, Madigan could be in position for a snag-free confirmation process. DOUGLAS ELMENDORF Now director of the Congressional Budget Office. A former Council of Economic Advisers and Fed economist, Elmendorf would bring experience with fiscal issues alongside monetary policy exposure. His warnings about high costs were seen as dealing a major blow to Democratic health care reform proposals last year. That analysis could burnish his credentials as an independent thinker and boost his appeal across party lines. KENNETH ROGOFF An economics professor at Harvard University, Rogoff is a former chief economist for the International Monetary Fund who has written about financial crises, global imbalances, and exchange rates. He ranked 24th in a list of most-cited economists, just behind Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke. AUSTAN GOOLSBEE Goolsbee, a former University of Chicago economics professor, has been an Obama adviser since campaign days and is now a member of the Council of Economic Advisers. His nomination -- more likely for a seat on the Fed board rather than the vice chairmanship -- could emphasize Fed sensitivity to the concerns of Main Street, not just those of Wall Street. MICHAEL WOODFORD A Columbia University professor who serves on the Fed's monetary advisory panel and consults for other central banks. Considered a pre-eminent authority on monetary policy, he would be untainted by involvement with the recent crisis, but may be inexperienced in dealing with a skeptical Congress and public.
