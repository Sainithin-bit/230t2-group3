 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The House of Representatives Financial Services Committee on Tuesday approved a bill that would crack down on the pay packages for executives at mortgage giants Fannie Mae ( FNMA.OB ) and Freddie Mac ( FMCC.OB ). 
 The bill would suspend 2011 compensation packages for executives at the two companies, which were taken over by the government in 2008, and instead have them paid based on a government pay scale. (Reporting by  Dave Clarke ; Editing by  Chizu Nomiyama )
