 (Reuters) - Staples Inc ( SPLS.O ), the largest U.S. office supply retailer, reported lower-than-expected quarterly sales, hurt by weak demand in Europe, and cut its profit forecast for the year. 
 Staples' weak sales report comes after smaller rivals Office Depot Inc ( ODP.N ) and OfficeMax Inc OMX.N also posted lower-than-expected revenue in their latest quarter. Third-quarter sales outside the United States fell 1.9 percent to $1.3 billion, mostly due to a 12 percent decrease in comparable-store sales in Europe and lower sales in Australia. European shoppers are struggling with a mix of inflation and high unemployment rates, against the backdrop of the euro zone's debt crisis. In the third quarter ended on October 29, net income rose to $326.3 million, or 47 cents a share, matching the average estimate as compiled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. A year earlier it earned $288.7 million, or 40 cents a share. Sales rose slightly to $6.57 billion, compared with the average estimate of $6.72 billion. Staples expects to earn a net profit of $1.38 to $1.42 a share for the full year, down from its previous outlook of $1.42 to $1.48.
