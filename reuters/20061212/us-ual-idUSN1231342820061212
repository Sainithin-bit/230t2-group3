 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - The chief executive of United Airlines parent UAL Corp. UAUA.O on Tuesday reiterated his view that the airline industry needs consolidation, but said he was not ready to disclose United's likely role in any consolidation. 

 "We think it is good and overdue for the industry despite the fact that it is difficult," Glenn Tilton said on a Webcast of a UAL investors meeting. "We are not in position to comment on anything specifically," Tilton said, adding that the airline is attentive to merger opportunities. Tilton's comments may have disappointed industry watchers who thought he might use Tuesday's forum to announce consolidation plans. United, which once contacted bankrupt Delta Air Lines DALRQ.PK about a possible merger, has long made it clear that it would like to be part of industry consolidation. The subject of airline mergers is front and center these days following last month's unsolicited bid for Delta by US Airways Group ( LCC.N ). Some experts believe US Airways' bid will trigger a wave of consolidation. Just last week, Northwest Airlines NWACQ.PK, which also is restructuring in bankruptcy, asked for court permission to hire a financial adviser to help it evaluate strategic alternatives that could include a merger. Northwest told employees in an internal posting that its interest in hiring an adviser does not mean that the company is considering a merger. The airline industry has been weakened in recent years by low-fare competition and soaring fuel prices. Many experts say the key to prosperity for airlines is to cut capacity -- the number of seats for sale -- in order to gain more leverage over fares. Airline mergers can result in capacity reductions where the routes and services of merging airlines overlap. Major carriers have managed to cut capacity this year and have implemented several lasting fare increases. Shares of UAL were down 3.26 percent at $43.08 at midday on Nasdaq.
