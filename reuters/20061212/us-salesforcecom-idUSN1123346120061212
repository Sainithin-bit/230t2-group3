 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Business software maker Salesforce.com Inc. ( CRM.N ) said on Tuesday it would help other companies market their software products on its Web site and charge commissions on sales generated by the new service. 

 Salesforce, which provides software to manage sales and marketing activities, already allows other software vendors to list products on its Web site at no charge. Under the new paid service to be launched in February, Salesforce will offer additional marketing assistance to help other software companies sell their products to Salesforce's client base and give them prominent positioning on the site. Salesforce said it would charge a commission equal to 10 percent of the first year's revenue on each sale that is closed. It also plans to add a premium version of the marketing service in August, charging a commission of 25 percent. The company's chief marketing officer, George Hu, declined in an interview to say how much revenue he expects the new services to generate. Salesforce also said it is developing a separate service that would handle ordering, billing and collection on software bought through the the Salesforce.com Web site. It aims to introduce that product in December 2007, Hu said. The company will charge other software vendors a 20 percent commission on all sales rung up through the online store.
