  (Updates with EU investigation) 

  By Marie-France Han SEOUL  Dec 12 (Reuters) - Shares of South Korean LCD panel
maker LG.Philips LCD Co. Ltd. ( 034220.KS ) ( LPL.N ) fell to
historic lows on Tuesday as a probe into possible price-fixing
by screen makers went global and spread to more firms.  Japan's Fair Trading Commission confirmed it was
investigating price fixing claims against LG.Philips and rivals
including Korea's Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. ( 005930.KS ) and
Sharp Corp. ( 6753.T ) of Japan.  A joint venture between Japan's Seiko Epson Corp. ( 6724.T )
and Sanyo Electric Co. Ltd. 6764.T, which specialises in small
liquid crystal display (LCD) screens for mobile phones and
digital cameras, is part of the investigation.  The European Union's top competition regulator also said it
was investigating possible cartel activities by producers of
thin film transistor/LCDs.  It named no companies involved but said the purpose of the
probe was "to ascertain whether there is evidence of a cartel
agreement and related practices concerning price fixing for
these products" breaching EU rules in a worldwide market worth
40 billion euros ($53 billion) in 2004.  LG.Philips said on Monday the U.S. Justice Department and
the Korean Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) were also looking into
the industry.  A public relations official at Taiwan's AU Optronics Corp.
( 2409.TW ), the world's third-largest LCD maker, confirmed late
on Tuesday that the company was also under investigation from
U.S. authorities.  LG.Philips share ended down 4.3 percent to 25,850 won in
Seoul after dropping as much as 7 percent to a record low of
24,950 won. The group is already under pressure after two
straight quarters of losses.  
  MARKET WORRIES  "The news of the antitrust investigation came on top of
market concerns that LG.Philips' net loss would be even wider
than expected," said Kim Seong-ki, chief investment officer at
SH Asset Management.  "We expect LG.Philips to keep losing money at least
throughout the first half. We maintain our 'underweight' rating
on the stock."  Shares in Samsung Electronics, whose LCD unit accounted for
less than 10 percent of operating profit in the third quarter,
dropped only 0.7 percent, about in line with the broader market.  News that the Japanese firms were being investigated came
after the Tokyo market had closed.  LG.Philips, a joint venture between LG Electronics Inc.
( 066570.KS ) and Dutch Philips Electronics ( PHG.AS ), vowed to
fully cooperate with authorities, as did Samsung.  A news report from Korean news service Yonhap speculated
that the probe may zero in on suspicions of collusion during
2003-2004, when LCD makers had better control of the market.  "From what we have heard, the investigation may be stemming
from a situation two or three years ago when the two companies
were selling LCD panels at comparable prices," said Michael Min,
an analyst at Korea Investment & Securities.  LG.Philips was the world's No.1 maker of the large LCD
panels used in flat-screen TVs and PC monitors in 2005. But this
year it has been overtaken by rival Samsung, which teamed up
with Japan's Sony Corp. ( 6758.T ).  In October, it reported a net loss of 321 billion won
($346.7 million) for the third quarter ended in September, after
posting a record 321.5 billion won loss in the second quarter.
 ($1=925.9 Won)
