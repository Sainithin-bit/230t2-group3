 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Weak performance in Goldman Sachs Group's ( GS.N ) flagship hedge fund this year could put a dent in the bank's first-quarter results, Chief Financial Officer David Viniar told investors Tuesday. 

 Goldman's $10 billion Global Alpha hedge fund is down roughly 12 percent this year, according to press reports. Viniar, who alluded to the reports during the bank's fourth-quarter conference call, acknowledged that Goldman's incentive fees fell dramatically in the fourth quarter. He also said they could suffer even sharper declines in the first fiscal period of 2007. "I think you read in the papers this past week that some of the hedge funds in our alternative investments part of Asset Management have not been performing great and that's really been driving the incentive fees down," Viniar said. Goldman, which said it nearly doubled fourth-quarter profit to $3.15 billion, said fund-management incentive fees plunged 78 percent to $23 million from $105 million a year earlier. They also fell 76 percent over the past three months, a period when the S&P 500 Index rose about 8 percent. But incentive fees from funds closing out their books on December 31 typically are paid out in the first quarter, he said. "So you will see a significant decline in that in the first quarter," Viniar said. He declined to elaborate on the scale of the decline. Goldman, the world's largest hedge fund manager, earned $910 million in management and other fees from its asset management business. Alternative investments under management, which include real estate and hedge funds, rose 32 percent to $145 billion from last year. Goldman recently hired 17 debt traders from collapsed Amaranth Advisers LLC in New York and Singapore. The traders, some of whom have already started work at Goldman, will set up a credit trading and investing business within Goldman Sachs Asset Management. These moves, which Viniar said was not related to the performance of its other funds, were intended to help Goldman expand its offerings for clients. Amaranth, a Greenwich, Connecticut-based hedge fund, collapsed in September when a trader lost some $6.5 billion on natural gas investments.
