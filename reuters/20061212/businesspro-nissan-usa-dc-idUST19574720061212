 ATSUGI, Japan  (Reuters) - The head of Nissan Motor Co. said 
on Tuesday he was in no rush to add production capacity in 
North America given lacklustre demand in the U.S. market. 

  "There's no doubt in my mind that with the product range, 
at a certain point in time we will need more capacity. The 
question is when," Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn told a news 
conference called to unveil Nissan's new design center outside 
of Tokyo.  Ghosn said he expected U.S. sales in 2007 to be "not much 
better" than in 2006, adding that meant additional capacity was 
not an urgent issue.  Through its four factories in North America -- two in the 
U.S. and two in Mexico -- Nissan has the capacity to build 1.33 
million vehicles a year.  In 2005, Nissan sold 1.38 million units in North America, 
including Mexico.  "We are not foreseeing any better conditions (in U.S. 
demand) in 2007," Ghosn said. "It's not a short-term decision."  Shares in Nissan were up 1.0 percent at 1,378 yen in 
afternoon trade, roughly in line with the transport sector 
sub-index.
