 TOULOUSE, France  (Reuters) - Aviation authorities were set 
on Tuesday to declare Airbus's mammoth new A380 aircraft safe 
for commercial flight, capping six years of development for the 
world's largest airliner, which has been hit by production 
delays. 

  The planemaker, the core business of European aerospace 
group EADS ( EAD.PA ), prepared to mark the end of a lengthy 
certification process at a ceremony at its Toulouse 
headquarters at 1400 GMT.  The airworthiness certificates from both European and U.S. 
aviation authorities are a vital step toward getting the 
555-seat double-decker into service. Such a step usually comes 
shortly before the first delivery of a new plane to airlines.  But Airbus was forced to scrap plans to deliver the first 
aircraft to Singapore Airlines ( SIAL.SI ) this month after 
repeated wiring installation problems pushed the first delivery 
back to October 2007 and plunged EADS into management turmoil 
in the summer.  Although the aircraft has passed months of flight tests in 
extreme conditions and impressed aviation enthusiasts the world 
over, successive delays and profit warnings mean deliveries are 
now on average two years behind schedule.  Angry airlines want penalties from Airbus. Some had 
launched a marketing blitz connected to the new plane, which is 
designed to offer luxury frills that can be customized for each 
airline.  U.S. parcel service FedEx ( FDX.N ) became the first A380 
customer to cancel an order last month, switching from the 
freight version of the plane to Boeing's ( BA.N ) 777.  Thai Airways International THAI.BK gave a warning earlier 
this month that it would cancel its order for six A380s if 
talks on compensation for delayed delivery failed.  Thai Airways, 69 percent owned by the government and state 
agencies, will make a final decision after its board meets on 
December 19, airline President Apinan Sumanaseni said.
  149 A380s SOLD SO-FAR  Airbus has sold a total of 149 A380s after deducting the 10 
originally ordered by FedEx.  The aircraft was conceived as the A3XX in 1997 and the 
project was formally launched as the A380 in December 2000.  Industry sources say it cost an estimated 12 billion euros 
($15.89 billion) to develop.  But critics say Airbus bet on the wrong plane as Boeing 
turned its back on the ultra-large market to focus on building 
a mid-sized twinjet for long-haul travel, the fuel-efficient 
787 Dreamliner which has notched up sales of more than 450 
planes.  After a false start and doubts over funding, Airbus hit 
back with the development launch of a rival aircraft, the A350 
XWB, last week.  The new plane will cost EADS 10 billion euros to develop 
and will enter service in 2013, five years behind the 787.  Airbus insists it was right to back the A380, however, due 
to rising passenger numbers and pressures on airport capacity.  The FedEx order cancellation, coupled with a decision by 
U.S. lessor ILFC ( AIG.N ) to switch freighters to the passenger 
version, has left question marks over the viability of the 
freighter version of the A380 and UPS ( UPS.N ), which is now the 
only freight customer, has said it is considering its options.  Airbus sales chief John Leahy said last week Airbus would 
build the freighter if UPS wanted it, but EADS co-Chief 
Executive Tom Enders said there was no need to scrap the 
super-freighter and there was demand for 500 cargo planes of 
that size in the next 20 years.
