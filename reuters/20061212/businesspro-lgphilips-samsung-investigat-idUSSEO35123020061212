 SEOUL  (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. ( 005930.KS ) 
is being investigated by fair trade watchdogs in South Korea, 
Japan and the United States, the second Korean flat screen 
maker named in a probe into possible price-fixing, a news 
agency report said on Tuesday. 

  The report, from South Korea's Yonhap news agency, follows 
a disclosure by LG.Philips LCD Co. Ltd. ( 034220.KS ) on Monday 
that it was the target of an investigation by the Korean Fair 
Trade Commission (KFTC), the Japanese Fair Trade Commission 
(JFTC) and had received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of 
Justice.  Shares in LG.Philips were down 5.56 percent at 25,500 won 
by 0023 GMT after hitting a record low of 24,950 won, against 
the wider market's 0.12 percent rise.  LG.Philips ( LPL.N ), a joint venture between LG Electronics 
Inc. ( 066570.KS ) and Philips Electronics ( PHG.AS ), vowed to 
fully cooperate with authorities.  Yonhap cited unnamed regulatory and industry sources in 
reporting local antitrust authorities were also looking into 
possible collusion by Samsung and LG.Philips to fix the prices 
of LCD products and control their supply.  A KFTC spokesman said he had no knowledge of the 
investigations. Calls to Samsung Electronics were not 
immediately returned.  Late on Monday, a KFTC spokesman said the probe was being 
conducted by the Cartel Investigation Group.  LG.Philips was the world's biggest maker of the large LCD 
panels used in flat-screen TVs and PC monitors last year. But 
in 2006, the loss-making company has been overtaken by rival 
Samsung, which teamed up with Japan's Sony Corp. ( 6758.T )
