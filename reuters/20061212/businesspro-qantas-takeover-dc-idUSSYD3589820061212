 MELBOURNE  (Reuters) - Australia's Qantas Airways Ltd. 
( QAN.AX ) has rejected a conditional A$10.9 billion ($8.6 
billion) buyout offer led by Macquarie Bank Ltd. MBL.AX and 
Texas Pacific Group TPG.UL. 

  The offer of A$5.50 a share was 5 percent above Qantas's 
last trade.  "The proposed offer price is A$5.50 per share and 
incorporates a number of complex conditions, the requirement 
for unanimous support by Qantas directors and a break fee," 
Qantas said in a statement.  "The non-executive directors consider that the terms of the 
proposal are not acceptable."  Qantas said it would keep shareholders informed of any 
further developments.  The bidding team includes Allco Equity Partners, Allco 
Finance Group AFG.AX, Macquarie, Canadian investment firm 
Onex Corp. ( OCX.TO ) and private equity firm Texas Pacific Group  TPG.UL.  The offer price is 26 percent higher than Qantas's share 
price before the airline said on November 22 that it had been 
approached with a buyout offer.  It values Qantas at 15.6 times forecast earnings for 2007, 
compared with regional rivals Singapore Airlines Ltd. ( SIAL.SI ) 
at 12.6 and Cathay Pacific Airways ( 0293.HK ) at 17.8, according 
to Reuters data.  A Qantas spokesman had no immediate comment and spokesmen 
for the bidding consortium were not immediately available.  ($1=A$1.27)
