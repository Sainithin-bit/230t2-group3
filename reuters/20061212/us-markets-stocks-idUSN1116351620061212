 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Tuesday after disappointing earnings from electronics chain Best Buy Inc. ( BBY.N ) and a weak forecast from steel maker Nucor Inc. ( NUE.N ) dented confidence in the outlooks for the holiday shopping season and corporate profits. 

 Technology shares led Nasdaq lower on concern that Dell Inc. DELL.O may have reduced orders for flat panel displays. A brief attempt at a rally after the Federal Reserve left benchmark rates unchanged, as expected, stalled when investors focused instead on the central bank's dour view of the slowdown in the housing market. That hurt home builders' stocks, while the financial sector was dragged lower by a drop in Citigroup Inc. ( C.N ) shares following investor disappointment with its management reshuffle. "Clearly, retail is being weighed down today by the underwhelming results from Best Buy. That has been a big weight and if you look at most of the other bigger retail names ... they are still susceptible to selling," said Michael James, senior trader at regional investment bank Wedbush Morgan in Los Angeles. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  fell 12.90 points, or 0.10 percent, to close at 12,315.58. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  slipped 1.48 points, or 0.10 percent, to finish at 1,411.56. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  dropped 11.26 points, or 0.46 percent, to end at 2,431.60. Best Buy, down almost 5 percent, was among the biggest drags on the S&P 500. But declines in the S&P 500 and the blue-chip Dow were limited by a 1.2 percent jump in shares of General Electric Co.( GE.N ), which raised its dividend and gave a bright outlook for the fourth quarter. An S&P index of retail stocks was down 1 percent. Shares of Best Buy fell 4.9 percent, or $2.62, to close at $51.30 on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares of Apple Computer Inc. ( AAPL.O ), down 2.9 percent, were the biggest weight on the Nasdaq and the second-biggest decliner in the S&P 500. Apple closed at $86.14, off $2.61. Dell's stock lost 2 percent, or 53 cents, to end at $26.20. It was the third-biggest drag on the Nasdaq 100. On the bright side was GE. The stock rose 1.2 percent, or 42 cents, to close at $35.64 on the NYSE after the diversified conglomerate said it was increasing its quarterly dividend by 12 percent. GE reaffirmed its fourth-quarter outlook. Citigroup Inc. ( C.N ) shares slid 1.2 percent, or 63 cents, to $52.25 on the NYSE. The big U.S. bank's stock was the heaviest weight on both the blue-chip Dow average and the broad S&P 500 a day after the company, under pressure to cut costs and boost a lackluster stock price, promoted its corporate and investment banking head to chief operating officer.  Pressure on Citigroup's shares "might just be on a perception that the market doesn't really care that much for the changes they made yesterday," said Jay Finkel, senior equity trader with Lord Abbett. Steel maker Nucor's stock lost 7.4 percent, or $4.75, to $59.60 on the NYSE after it warned that fourth-quarter profit would slide well below Wall Street's projections. Nucor was the S&P 500's third-biggest loser, with its decline pulling down steel and related stocks. Aluminum producer Alcoa Inc.'s ( AA.N ) shares fell 1.4 percent, or 44 cents, to $30.61 on the NYSE after RBC Capital Markets said it was lowering its rating on the company's stock. Shortly after the Fed's announcement, it looked like the major stock indexes would cut the session's losses and return to levels little changed from Monday's close. "The Fed decision and statement means that nothing has changed and, therefore, it is still clear sailing for the stock market," said Charles Lieberman, chief investment officer of Advisors Capital Management, LLC in Paramus, New Jersey. But the Fed's darker view of the slowdown in the housing sector gave investors another reason to sell some home builders' shares. The Dow Jones U.S. home construction index .DJUSHB shed 0.8 percent. Shares of luxury home builder Toll Brothers ( TOL.N ) dropped 1.2 percent, or 37 cents, to $31.24 on the NYSE. Shares of Home Depot Inc. ( HD.N ), the world's largest home improvement retailer, declined 0.2 percent, or 9 cents, to $38.70.
