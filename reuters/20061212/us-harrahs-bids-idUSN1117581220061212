 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The board of Harrah's Entertainment Inc. HET.N plans to meet on Wednesday to consider buyout offers, sources said on Monday, with bids expected to come in higher than a $15.5-billion cash offer. 

 Bids are expected to be above $85.50 per share, including a $2 dividend that the current private equity bidders will allow Harrah's to pay shareholders as planned, on top of their $83.50 in cash, according to sources. Harrah's, the world's largest gambling company, has set a deadline of Tuesday on all bids and could also consider a leveraged recapitalization should the bids not prove compelling, sources familiar with the situation said. On October 2, Harrah's said a committee of non-management directors was reviewing a takeover offer of $81 per share from private equity firms Apollo Management and Texas Pacific Group (TPG) TPG.UL. The group raised the bid to $83.50 per share a week later, or $15.5 billion, sources said. Las Vegas-based Harrah's, which operates casinos under the Harrah's, Caesars and Horseshoe brand names, has also drawn the interest of another group led by Penn National Gaming Inc. ( PENN.O ) and hedge fund D.E. Shaw. Penn, which is significantly smaller than Harrah's, is considering making a cash-and-stock offer, a source familiar with the situation said two weeks ago. The Apollo-TPG group is expected to submit an offer above $85.50 per share, sources said. Even after the group raised its bid last time, analysts thought the offer was low, given where shares were trading and given the company's growth prospects. A TPG spokesman declined to comment. An Apollo spokesman could not immediately be reached. Sources were unclear about the Penn-D.E. Shaw offer. Private equity firms value companies mainly on their cash flow, because they need the cash to pay down the debt used to finance the deal. Bids of $85 to $90 per share would value Harrah's at about 10.5 to 11 times its forecast 2007 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization -- a measure of cash flow. That multiple is in line with other gaming deals and considered high but not expensive by modern private equity standards. Private equity firms have turned to the casino sector as they look for cash-rich businesses in which to invest the hundreds of billions of dollars they have raised this year. Station Casinos Inc. ( STN.N ) said last week it had received a $4.7-billion buyout offer from a group of investors including management and Los Angeles-based real estate investment firm Colony Capital. Harrah's shares have risen 6 percent since word hit the market on November 29 that a second group might make a bid for the company. Harrah's has a market value of $14.8 billion, based on its closing share price on Monday of $79.74. Penn's market capitalization is $3.2 billion. Harrah's was not immediately available for comment on Monday. A spokesman for Texas Pacific declined to comment. Penn also declined to comment.
