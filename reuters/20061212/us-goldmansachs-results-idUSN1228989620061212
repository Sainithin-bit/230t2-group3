 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc. ( GS.N ), the world's largest investment bank, said on Tuesday quarterly earnings nearly doubled on strong growth in almost every business, but some investors questioned whether the company can keep up the pace. 

 Goldman capped what is expected to be a record year for Wall Street as fiscal fourth-quarter net income surged to $3.15 billion, or $6.59 a share, for the three months ended November 24, from $1.63 billion, or $3.35, in the year-ago period. Goldman's net revenue rose 47 percent to $9.41 billion. Goldman's ( GS.N ) profit beat the average analyst estimate of $6.36 a share for the quarter, even after analysts increased their forecasts multiple times in recent months. For the year, Goldman earned an all-time high $9.54 billion, more than the previous two years combined and its fourth straight year of record results, contributing to a stellar return on equity of 33 percent for the year. Yet the stock, up 59 percent this year, fell $1.46 to $201.06 as investors worried that Goldman's earnings may have peaked. "Everybody is somewhat jittery about the future growth of this company," said David Stepherson, a portfolio manager at Baltimore-based Hardesty Capital Management. "It's doubtful they will have the type of year they just had." The New York bank kicked off two weeks of earnings reports from the largest U.S. securities firms, which were expected to rebound from a sluggish third quarter. Lehman Brothers LEH.N and Bear Stearns BSC.N report their results on Thursday. In trading and principal investments, the company's biggest business, revenue rose 57 percent to $6.63 billion. Fixed income, currencies and commodities trading income surged 58 percent to $3.10 billion as bonds and commodities gains were offset in part by declines in currencies and mortgages. Equities trading meanwhile rose 52 percent to $2.13 billion fueled by stocks, derivatives and its purchase of an insurance company portfolio earlier this year. Goldman's $13.4 billion in principal investments generated net revenue of $1.4 billion, reflecting a $949 million gain from Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd ( 1398.HK ), which went public in the largest IPO ever in October, as well as $528 million in other corporate stakes and fees. An investment in Japanese golf courses, spun off last month as Accordia Golf Co. ( 2131.T ), generated a gain of about $500 million. Goldman also once again led the industry in mergers advisory and stock offerings for the year. Investment banking rose 42 percent to $1.34 billion, fueled by a 78 percent increase in underwriting and a 15 percent jump in M&A fees. "All trends point to continued strength into 2007," Chief Financial Officer David Viniar told analysts, who expressed equal parts optimism and caution about the coming year. "If global economic growth continued and markets remained stable our investment banking clients will continue to be active." Meanwhile, asset management and securities services revenue rose 20 percent to $982 million. Managed assets grew $47 billion, or 7 percent, to $676 billion during the quarter. "This is as good as it gets," Tradition Capital Management analyst Marc Davis said. "Wall Street is a cyclical business. You have to watch out for the peaks." One dark spot in the quarter was a 78 percent drop in asset-management incentive fees, driven by poor performance in Goldman's flagship hedge fund this year. Viniar told analysts this stream of income could suffer sharper declines in the first quarter, when most incentive fees are reported. He also told reporters that Goldman's backlog of deals increased during the fourth quarter to the highest level since 2000, but warned that markets change quickly. "As we sit here right now, we're seeing a good backlog, a lot of dialogue with our companies and financial sponsors," Viniar said. "Anything can change, but there are still high levels of CEO confidence, looking to do transactions or financings. They're pretty comfortable with their business right now. (The environment) feels pretty good." Several analysts noted Goldman largely beat estimates by reporting lower-than-expected compensation expenses, which came to 43 percent of revenue even as global headcount surged 12 percent to 26,500 over the past year. Still, investors say they expect Goldman to continue beating the market's cautious expectations. "It's been an absolutely fantastic year, with businesses firing on all cylinders," Hardesty's Stepherson said. "We think there is more growth to go."
