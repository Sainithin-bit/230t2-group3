 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Some top executives at British oil company BP ( BP.L ) are worried that cost cutting at a Texas refinery might have contributed to the plant's poor state of safety and equipment, according to an internal BP review, The Wall Street Journal reported on its Web site on Tuesday. 

 The Texas City refinery was the site of a deadly explosion in March 2005 that killed 15 workers. BP officials have said they believed budgetary decisions didn't play a critical role in the accident, caused when workers restarted a small gasoline-processing unit, the Journal said. A BP spokesman confirmed that the company had done an internal review of the accident, which has not been made public. He said he would not comment on the contents of that report, but added that it was not true that BP Chief Executive John Browne was unconcerned about safety. The Journal said it had reviewed documents in which a former senior BP safety executive was quoted as saying that Browne "showed little interest" in safety issues.
