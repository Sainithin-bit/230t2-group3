 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The dollar edged higher against the euro on Tuesday after data showed the U.S. trade deficit shrank in October to its narrowest since August 2005. 

 Ahead of a Federal Reserve policy meeting later in the day, the Commerce Department said the October deficit shrank to $58.87 billion from September's downwardly revised $64.26 billion) and below forecasts for $63.00 billion. The euro EUR=> pared its gains and fell to $1.3228 from $1.3240 before the data, showing a 0.1 percent loss on the day, while against the yen, the dollar JPY=> was largely steady at 117.03, showing little change on pre-data levels and up about 0.1 percent from Monday. Later in the session, the Fed is widely expected to leave rates unchanged at 5.25 percent and repeat its caution on a possible uptick in inflation, but financial markets reflect a good chance the central bank will cut rates in the early part of next year.
