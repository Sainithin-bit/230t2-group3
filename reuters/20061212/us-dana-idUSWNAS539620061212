 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Bankrupt U.S. auto and truck parts maker Dana Corp. DCNAQ.PK on Tuesday announced plans to close four plants in the United States and Canada to consolidate operations or shift to lower-cost areas, cutting 440 jobs. 

 Dana had said in November that it expected to close eight additional plants, and reduce capacity at three others, as part of its reorganization. It expects to complete plans for the other four plant closings in 2007. The first four plants to close are in Syracuse, Indiana; Cape Girardeau, Missouri; Guelph, Ontario; and Thorold, Ontario, Dana said. It expects total pretax charges of $45 million from 2006 through 2009 for the four closings.
