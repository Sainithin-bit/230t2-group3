 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oil fell on Tuesday as milder weather hit top consumer the United States and as OPEC members disagreed on whether the cartel needs to trim output again to reduce global stockpiles. 

 U.S. crude prices CLF7 settled down 20 cents to $61.02, after losing 81 cents on Monday. London Brent crude LCOF7 lost 32 cents to settle at $61.52 a barrel. Mild weather in the U.S. Northeast, the country's biggest heating oil consuming region, and the return of refiners from autumn maintenance pushed the market lower after U.S. crude traded above $62 a barrel in earlier activity. "At this stage, it is difficult to paint a bullish case except for OPEC around the corner, and OPEC is sending mixed signals," said Nauman Barakat, senior vice president at Macquarie Futures USA. Ministers from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries have sent mixed signals ahead of their meeting, scheduled for Thursday in the Nigerian capital Abuja. A consensus seemed to be building that the market is still oversupplied since OPEC agreed to a 1.2 million barrel cut from November 1, with some members saying they backed a cut of at least 500,000 barrels per day (bpd). But an OPEC delegate said OPEC's Gulf members, including top exporter Saudi Arabia, favor leaving output goals unchanged and seeking greater compliance with the previous target. "No cut, compliance -- this is the view up until now from the Gulf members," the delegate said. Kuwaiti Oil Minister Sheikh Ali al-Jarrah al-Sabah and his United Arab Emirates counterpart Mohammed bin Dhaen al-Hamli were just two of the arriving ministers who said there was too much crude in the market. Bulging stocks helped knock U.S. oil prices from a record high above $78 a barrel this summer. But heavy refinery maintenance this autumn has led to drawdowns in product inventories in the world's top consumer. INVENTORIES The market is looking toward data to be released on Wednesday by the International Energy Agency, which represents the interests of consuming nations, to gauge the effects of OPEC cuts on inventories. "It may well be that the delegates make their decision on Wednesday night, and the OPEC ministers will certainly be looking at the IEA report," said Mike Wittner, global head of energy market research at Calyon. OPEC, which pumps more than a third of the world's oil, has implemented about 730,000 bpd of its promised 1.2 million bpd cutback from November, according to a Reuters survey. Analysts in a Reuters poll expected crude stocks to have fallen by 700,000 barrels last week as refineries crank up output ahead of the peak winter demand period. But they will remain high since they have reached their highest level for this time of year since 1993. Oil ministers also pointed to the weakening dollar, which reduces OPEC's purchasing power from dollar-denominated oil, as another concern that would affect its calculations when it came to acting to stem a 22 percent oil price slide since a record over $78 in July. OPEC linchpin Saudi Arabia has already told oil refiners in Asia that it will reduce their supplies next month to 8 percent below contracted volumes. About half of the kingdom's 7 million bpd of crude exports moves to Asia. (Additional reporting by Neil Chatterjee in Singapore, and  Simon Webb  and Oliver Bullough in London)
