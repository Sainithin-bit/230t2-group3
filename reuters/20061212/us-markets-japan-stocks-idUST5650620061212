 TOKYO  (Reuters) - The Nikkei average rose 0.66 percent on Tuesday as exporters such as Kyocera Corp. ( 6971.T ) advanced on a weak yen, while seafood suppliers jumped after a merger announcement by Maruha Group Inc. ( 1334.T ) fueled speculation of a further sector shakeup. 

 Electronic firms such as Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Ltd. ( 6752.T ) and Sony Corp. ( 6758.T ) climbed after Credit Suisse reported good sales of their products in the U.S. market during the holiday shopping season. Securities brokers such as Nomura Holdings Inc. ( 8604.T ) rose on expectations for an extension of preferential tax measures on stocks, while investors bought shares of banks such as Mizuho Financial Group Inc. ( 8411.T ) that lagged behind the latest rally in other sectors on the Tokyo market. "There are no special factors behind today's advance in the banking sector," said Susumu Abe, manager at the information and investment department of Mito Securities Co. "With overall market sentiment improving, investors turned their focus to bank shares that look to have more room to advance." Abe said market sentiment has been improving this month as selling pressure from foreign hedge funds ahead of their end-November book closings has disappeared, and as confidence in the domestic economy has returned thanks to upbeat economic data. "I expect the Nikkei will regain the 17,000 mark by the end of the year," he said. But Yoshihisa Okamoto, senior vice president at Fuji Investment Management, said he was not so optimistic about the market's outlook as its advance was led by gains in TOPIX core 30 shares, with many of smaller stocks left behind the recovery. TOPIX Core30 .TOPXC climbed 1.1 percent to 1,026.15 on Tuesday, compared with a 0.5 percent rise in the TOPIX index. "I wonder if the current rally is sustainable, as medium and small-cap shares are still continuing their downturn," he said. The Nikkei gained 109.79 points to 16,637.78, adding to a 0.67 percent rise in the previous session and setting the highest close since October 27. The broader TOPIX index ended at 1,636.72. Trade volume rose to 1.84 billion shares from 1.69 billion on Monday. Advancing shares outnumbered decliners by 810 to 759. SEAFOOD FIRMS, BROKERS Seafood supplier Maruha jumped 6.4 percent to 266 yen after it announced on Monday a merger plan with smaller rival Nichiro Corp. 1331.T. Nichiro surged 14.2 percent to 242 yen, helping the fish and forest subindex .IFISH.T become the best-performing sector. The merger plan spurred speculation of a further shakeup, helping other seafood stocks extend gains. Hohsui Corp. ( 1352.T ), a seafood trader, gained 7.0 percent to 213 yen. Securities brokers such as Nomura Holdings Inc. ( 8604.T ) and Okasan Holdings Inc. ( 8609.T ) rose, as the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's tax panel has come up with a plan to extend preferential tax measures on stocks for a year. One preferential measure that cuts the tax rate on capital gains to 10 percent from 20 percent is due to expire at the end of next year, while another that reduces the tax rate on dividends will expire at the end of March 2008. Nomura gained 2.4 percent to 2,110 yen, while Okasan added 2.6 percent to 799 yen. Shares of Japan's Duskin Co. Ltd. ( 4665.T ) slipped 1.4 percent in their $151 million market debut on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's first section on Tuesday, reflecting lackluster investor appetite. Duskin, a provider of cleaning services and the operator of Japan's biggest doughnut retail chain, offered 10 million existing shares including 1.3 million in a green shoe option in a double listing on the Tokyo and Osaka exchanges. In Osaka it ended 3 percent down. Matsushita Electric rose 1.8 percent to 2,320 yen and Sony added 2.1 percent to 4,790 yen, after Credit Suisse said the Japanese electric firms are raising their market shares in the Christmas shopping season in the United States. Investors also bought stock in exporters after the dollar hit a nearly three-week high around 117.26 yen  JPY=  in New York on Monday. A weaker yen benefits Japanese firms that make the bulk of their profits outside Japan as it boosts profits when earnings are brought home. Kyocera rose 0.9 percent to 10,740 yen, while Honda Motor Co. Ltd. ( 7267.T ) gained 1.5 percent to 4,200 yen.
