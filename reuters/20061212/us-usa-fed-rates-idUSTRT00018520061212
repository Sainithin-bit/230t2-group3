 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve on Tuesday held benchmark interest rates steady at 5.25 percent for a fourth straight meeting, while renewing a warning that risks from inflation remain. 

 The widely expected decision by the central bank's Federal Open Market Committee keeps the overnight federal funds rate target at the level it hit in June after 17 straight quarter-percentage point increases. In a statement outlining its decision, the Fed said it continues to focus on inflation risks, holding out the prospect that interest rates may need to move higher in coming months, even as it took note of the "substantial" cooling in the U.S. housing market. "Readings on core inflation have been elevated, and the high level of resource utilization has the potential to sustain inflation pressures," the Fed said. "However, inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time." Financial markets did not react sharply to the Fed's statement, which was largely as expected. U.S. stocks pared losses, prices for U.S. government bonds rose slightly and the value of the dollar slipped. The decision was not unanimous. As he had at the previous three meetings, Richmond Federal Reserve Bank President Jeffrey Lacker dissented, saying he believed higher borrowing costs are needed to keep inflation in check. Lacker's string of dissents is the longest by a Fed policy-maker since then-Cleveland Fed President Jerry Jordan dissented four straight times in 1998. However, other Fed policy-makers -- in a statement that closely mirrored their last policy announcement in October -- continued to express faith a cooler pace of economic growth would ease inflation pressures. But they declined to take the option of a rate rise down the road off the table. "The extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth," the Fed statement said. U.S. output grew at a 2.2 percent annual rate in the third quarter, slowing from 2.6 percent in the second quarter and 5.6 percent in the first three months of the year. Many economists see the U.S. long-term trend growth rate at around 3 percent. However, core inflation rose 2.4 percent over the year through October, according to the Fed's favorite gauge, off only slightly from a more than 11-year high of 2.5 percent in August. Many Fed officials would like to see it contained in a 1 percent to 2 percent range. While Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and his colleagues have said higher-than-desired core inflation is a worry, they expect it to ease as slower growth pushes up unemployment. Recent data have corroborated the Fed's view of an economy growing below long-term trend and regaining some slack. A gauge of factory activity from the Institute for Supply Management dropped below the break-even point between expansion and contraction for the first time in 3-1/2 years in November. In addition, the government's most-reliable measure of home prices showed them edging up at a modest annual rate of 3.45 percent in the third quarter, the slowest quarterly rise since the second quarter of 1998. A slowdown in housing is expected to dampen consumer spending. Wal-Mart ( WMT.N ), the world's largest retailer, said sales at its U.S. stores open at least a year fell 0.1 percent from November 2005, the first decline since April 1996. So far, however, the economy has proven resilient. The Labor Department said on Friday that U.S. employers had created 132,000 jobs in November, a stronger performance than Wall Street had expected and one that led financial markets to scale back bets on interest rates cuts next year. The same report, however, showed the unemployment rate rose to 4.5 percent from October's 5-1/2 year low of 4.4 percent, which may have provided some comfort to Fed officials who have worried job-market tightness could lead to wage gains that would put further upward pressure on prices.
