 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Best Buy Co. Inc. ( BBY.N ) reported lower-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday as the consumer electronics retailer cut prices on flat-panel TVs to boost sales at the start of the holiday shopping season, sending its shares down 5 percent. 

 The results also dragged down other electronics retailers' stocks, as investors fretted that the competitive environment would hurt profits during the fourth quarter, which includes the bulk of the holiday shopping season. Shares of Circuit City Stores Inc. CC.N fell 5 percent, while Tweeter Home Entertainment Group Inc. TWTR.O tumbled almost 12 percent. Best Buy reported net income of $150 million, or 31 cents per share, for the fiscal third quarter ended November 25, compared with $138 million, or 28 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts, on average, had been expecting 35 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. The company said third-quarter revenue rose 16 percent to $8.47 billion, above analysts' average forecast of $8.45 billion, helped by the addition of 227 new stores in the past 12 months. Sales at stores open at least a year, a key gauge of retail strength known as comparable-store sales, rose 4.8 percent. "A very competitive climate put pressure on our margins, resulting in earnings below our original expectations," Chief Executive Brad Anderson said in a statement. Flat-panel LCD and plasma televisions have emerged as one of the holiday season's hottest items, and retailers have rolled out promotions to lure customers into their stores. In September, Best Buy was already aggressively advertising its selection of high-definition TVs, while Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) started marking down prices on flat-panel TVs in October, much earlier than usual. STAYING POWER? Analysts have been waiting to see how well specialty retailers like Best Buy and Circuit City can stand up to pricing pressure from Wal-Mart and each other. Investors have predicted that the price competition will reduce margins, leading to lower profits. Scot Ciccarelli, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said Best Buy's third-quarter results were disappointing. "The sales turned out better than what most people had expected," he said. "Unfortunately, the margins were under more pressure, and as a result they missed earnings." Best Buy's gross profit rate for the third quarter was 23.5 percent of revenue, down from 24.4 percent a year earlier. The retailer attributed the decline to increased sales of lower-margin products, like notebook computers and video game consoles, and hefty promotions during the Thanksgiving holiday shopping weekend. In an interview, Anderson said he was surprised at how steep the discounts were for the Thanksgiving weekend and customers purchased more low margin items than anticipated. Best Buy chose to match or beat competitors' prices on name-brand flat-panel TVs. While that hurt profits, Anderson said it increased Best Buy's market share and should continue to attract customers to its stores. "The quarter finished with a robust double-digit comparable-store sales gain on the Thanksgiving weekend," Chief Financial Officer Darren Jackson said on a conference call. "Our finish to the quarter was impressive and should bode well for the fourth quarter." The company said it was on track to report full-year earnings of $2.65 per share to $2.80 per share. Analysts' average forecast is $2.82, according to Reuters Estimates. For the year, it said it now expects a comparable-store sales gain of 4 percent to 5 percent, compared with its previous forecast of 3 percent to 5 percent. Best Buy shares fell as low as $50.31 before recovering a bit to $51.12, down $2.80, in late afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares have traded in a 52-week range of $59.50 to $42.80. Circuit City shares were down $1.35 at $23.59, and Tweeter shares were off 29 cents at $2.18.
