 BOSTON  (Reuters) - General Electric Co. ( GE.N ) said on 
Tuesday that it was raising its quarterly dividend by 12 
percent, and that it expects to report a profit of $2.17 to 
$2.23 per share in 2007. 

  Analysts had expected a profit of $2.24 next year at the 
world's second-largest company by market value.  "Global economic growth continues," GE Chairman and Chief 
Executive Jeff Immelt told investors in New York. "Our orders 
outside the United States are very strong, Europe is 
particularly strong right now. Housing and auto have definitely 
been impacted by interest rate increases."  GE's size and breadth -- its businesses range from building 
jet engines, to commercial finance, to NBC Universal media -- 
make it a barometer of the U.S. economy.  Immelt said the company's diversification would allow it to 
hit its targets even in an economic slowdown.  "We are going to be able to hit it even if the economy 
slows, because of the strength that we have in businesses like 
infrastructure," Immelt said. His comments were monitored on 
the Internet.  The diversified conglomerate also reaffirmed its outlook 
for its 2006 fourth-quarter and full year earnings.  It said it still expects earnings of 62 to 64 cents a share 
for the fourth quarter, and $1.97 to $1.99 a share for the year 
2006.  Analysts were expecting 64 cents and $1.98, respectively 
for the fourth quarter and 2006, according to Reuters 
Estimates.  GE also raised its quarterly dividend to 28 cents per share 
from 25 cents. It said expects to deliver another year of two 
to three times gross domestic product organic revenue growth.  Its shares rose 42 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $35.64.  "This has been a stock that has been lagging the market for 
a while and this clarity on their outlook and visibility of 
their earnings is being greeted favorably by the market," said 
Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Asset 
Management. "The increase in the dividend is a statement by 
management and the board that they are comfortable with the 
performance of the company both today and going into next 
year."  GE shares are up 0.3 percent for the year, compared with a 
14.9 rise in the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  
has hit record highs.  "The dividend is growing along with earnings growth," said 
David Katz, chief investment officer at Matrix Asset Advisors. 
"The stock is poised again to do better."  The Fairfield, Connecticut-based company is the first of a 
trio of top U.S. manufacturers due to issue their 2007 
financial forecasts this week. Next up are United Technologies 
Corp. ( UTX.N ) and Honeywell International Inc. ( HON.N )  (Additional reporting by Nick Zieminski in New York)
