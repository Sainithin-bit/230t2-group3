 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Two private equity firms will buy Sabre Holdings Corp. TSG.N, owner of the Travelocity hotel and flight-booking Web site, for $4.45 billion as they look to profit from a boom in travel services. 

 The move, by private equity firms Texas Pacific Group TPG.UL and Silver Lake Partners, follows Blackstone Group's BG.UL $4.3 billion purchase of Travelport in August, and could make rivals Expedia Inc. ( EXPE.O ) and Priceline ( PCLN.O ) takeover targets. The wave of privatizations comes amid strong bookings growth for travel Web sites, but only modest share gains. "After a thorough assessment, we concluded that this transaction represents a compelling outcome for our shareholders, customers and employees," said Sam Gilliland, Sabre's chief executive. Under the terms of the deal, Sabre shareholders will get $32.75 per share in cash, or $4.45 billion overall, an 8 percent premium to Sabre's closing price on Monday, when talk of deal sharply lifted its shares. It is a premium of 30 percent over Sabre's average closing share price over the preceding two months, the company said. At the beginning of November, Sabre's shares were trading at the same level they had two years earlier. The deal, which is set to close in the second quarter of 2007, also includes the assumption of $550 million in debt. It will not change Sabre's executive team nor its Southlake, Texas headquarters, the company said. Sabre shares rose $1.50, or 5 percent, to $31.93 on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares of Priceline and Expedia also rose slightly. The proposed buyout of Sabre follows Blackstone's purchase of former Cendant unit Travelport, which operates the Orbitz travel site. The chief executives of rival online travel agencies Expedia and Priceline each predicted last month that travel sites would attract more private equity offers. Private equity firms have seen their busiest period in more than five years because of strong debt markets and a steady economy. Leveraged buyouts, as their deals are known, now make up more than 20 percent of global merger and acquisition activity, up from some 5 percent a few years ago.
