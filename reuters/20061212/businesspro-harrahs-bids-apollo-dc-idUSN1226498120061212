 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Apollo Management and Texas Pacific 
Group are expected to raise their bid for Harrah's 
Entertainment Inc. HET.N to $87 a share, the Wall Street 
Journal reported on its Web site on Tuesday, citing people 
familiar with the matter. 

  That would value the company at around $16 billion.  On October 2, Harrah's said a committee of non-management 
directors was reviewing a takeover offer of $81 per share from 
private equity firms Apollo Management and Texas Pacific Group 
(TPG) TPG.UL. The group raised the bid to $83.50 per share a 
week later, or $15.5 billion, sources told Reuters at the time.  Las Vegas-based Harrah's, which operates casinos under the 
Harrah's, Caesars and Horseshoe brand names, has also drawn the 
interest of another group led by Penn National Gaming Inc. 
( PENN.O ) and hedge fund D.E. Shaw.  Penn, which is significantly smaller than Harrah's, is 
considering making a cash-and-stock offer, a source familiar 
with the situation told Reuters said two weeks ago.  Harrah's board set a deadline of Tuesday for bids and 
planned to meet on Wednesday to consider buyout offers, sources 
told Reuters on Monday.  Harrah's was not immediately available for comment.
