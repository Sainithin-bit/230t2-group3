 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Two Wall Street credit ratings agencies said they may cut the ratings of Sabre Holdings Corp. TSG.N after two private equity firms on Tuesday said they reached a deal to buy the flight-booking Web site for $4.45 billion. 

 Sabre, owner of the Travelocity hotel and airline booking service, is rated "Baa3" by Moody's Investors Service, or one level above investment grade. Sabre is rated "BBB" by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, or two levels above junk. The ratings review came after Sabre said on Tuesday that its board of directors approved an agreement with Silver Lake Partners and Texas Pacific Group to acquire the company. That deal may result in a "multiple notch rating downgrade" affecting $800 million of existing notes, Moody's said in a statement. "Once approved, the transaction, valued at approximately $5 billion, including the assumption of approximately $550 million in net debt, is likely to result in a significant increase in financial leverage," Moody's analyst John Moore wrote. The latest deal follows Blackstone Group's $4.3 billion purchase of Travelport in August, and could make rivals Expedia Inc. ( EXPE.O ) and Priceline.com Inc. ( PCLN.O ) takeover targets. Ratings on review for possible downgrade include $400 million senior unsecured notes due August 2011 and $400 million senior unsecured notes due March 2016, Moody's said. Standard & Poor's also put Sabre's ratings on negative ratings watch on Tuesday, meaning a ratings cut is more likely than an upgrade. Sabre has about 9,000 employees and annual sales of more than $2.5 billion. Its Travelocity site is the second-largest U.S.-based online travel agency after Expedia.
