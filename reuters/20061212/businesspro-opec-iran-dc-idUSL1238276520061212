 TEHRAN  (Reuters) - Most OPEC members are in favor of a cut 
in oil output to combat excess supplies and to ensure prices 
stay above $60 a barrel, Iran's oil minister said on Tuesday. 

  "Considering the considerable supply surplus over demand we 
are trying to cut production," Kazem Vaziri-Hamaneh was quoted 
as saying by the Oil Ministry's news Web site.  "Iran, like most OPEC members, does not consider an oil 
price of less than $60 a barrel as appropriate," he said before 
leaving for an OPEC meeting in the Nigerian capital Abuja.  Traditionally a price hawk within the OPEC cartel, Iran has 
favored an output cut at the Abuja meeting for some time.  Iran's OPEC governor Hossein Kazempour Ardebili said the 
Abuja meeting must take into account a number of factors 
weighing on oil prices such as plentiful U.S. oil stocks, 
slower-than-expected world economic growth, excess supply and 
projected increases in non-OPEC output.  Hasan Qabazard, OPEC's director of research, told Reuters 
on Monday that a narrow majority of OPEC members favored 
cutting production again at the Abuja meeting.
