 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. job openings, hires and job 
turnover rates were little changed in October, the Labor 
Department said on Tuesday. 

  The 3 percent job openings rate was unchanged from the 
previous month and little changed since November 2005, the 
department said in its latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover 
Survey (JOLTS).  In October, the job openings rate rose in manufacturing, 
education and health services, and leisure and hospitality, but 
fell in trade, transportation and utilities.  The hires rate in October, or additions to the payrolls 
during the month, was little changed at 3.6 percent. The hires 
rate rose in manufacturing, education and health services, and 
in leisure and hospitality, but fell in government, the Labor 
Department said.  The October total separations rate was unchanged at 3.2 
percent. There were more terminations in construction and in 
professional and business services, but fewer in government, 
manufacturing, trade, and transportation and utilities.  The quits rate, which can serve as a barometer of workers' 
ability to change jobs, was little changed at 1.9 percent in 
October. During the month, the quits rate did not rise 
significantly in any industry but declined in government.  Over the 12 months through October, hires have averaged 4.9 
million per month, while separations have average 4.5 million 
per month. For the comparable year-ago period, hires averaged 
4.8 million, while separations averaged 4.6 million.  October job openings numbered 4.207 million, up from 4.154 
million the previous month, the report showed.  (Reporting by  Nancy Waitz , editing by Tom Hals; Reuters
