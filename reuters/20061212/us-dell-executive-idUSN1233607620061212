 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Dell Inc. DELL.O has named former EDS EDS.N executive Steve Schuckenbrock to lead the computer maker's $5 billion a year global services organization, the latest in a string of new management hires. 

 Separately, Dell said it was restructuring its product groups into two segments -- business and consumer -- instead of along product lines -- enterprise and client, as it was has long been organized. Senior management remains in place. The management changes and restructuring follow a year of turmoil for Dell, which has suffered from slowing revenue growth amid falling prices for its products and tougher competition from arch-rival Hewlett-Packard Co. ( HPQ.N ). Shares of Dell fell 2 percent to $26.20 in midday trading on Nasdaq and are in the midpoint of their 52-week range. The business segment covers products sold to businesses both large and small and accounts for around 82 percent of Dell sales. The consumer product group generates the remainder. Last week, the company hired Sona Chawla, formerly of banking company Wells Fargo & Co. ( WFC.N ), as vice president in charge of Dell's online business group, which is responsible for $16 billion, or around 30 percent of company revenue. In recent months, Dell has also hired away two key executives from Hewlett-Packard. Rick Becker, who was general manager of HP's fast growing "blade" server business, to be an engineering vice president in charge of strategy working with partners like Oracle and SAP for corporate customers. Richard Conrad joined Dell as head of worldwide procurement from HP, where he ran global supply chain operations. As senior vice president of global services, Schuckenbrock will report to CEO Kevin Rollins and serve as a member of the Dell Global Executive Management Committee. He will begin work with Dell on January 8. The global services unit is set to contribute around 10 percent of Round Rock, Texas-based company's expected $56 billion in 2006 revenue, and is its fastest growing business. Schuckenbrock served from 2003 until earlier this year as co-chief operating officer and executive vice president of global sales and services for Electronic Data Systems Corp. Before joining EDS, he was chief operating officer of consulting firm The Feld Group. He was chief information officer at consumer products company PepsiCo and its Frito-Lay unit and an executive at IBM ( IBM.N ) from 1983 to 1993.
