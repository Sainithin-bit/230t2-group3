 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - Dense fog kept ships from moving along 
the Houston Ship Channel on Tuesday morning, the U.S. Coast 
Guard said. 

  The entire 53-mile (85.3-kilometer) waterway to the busiest 
U.S. petrochemical port has been shut since 6 p.m. CST Monday 
(0000 GMT Tuesday), but the northern portion to the port of 
Houston was shut shortly after 1 p.m.  Portions of the ship channel had been closed Monday 
morning, only completely reopening at 10:35 a.m..  Vessel traffic is halted on the ship channel when it 
becomes unsafe to navigate the waterway that supplies crude oil 
to refineries in Houston and Texas City, Texas, which account 
for 11.8 percent of U.S. refining capacity.
