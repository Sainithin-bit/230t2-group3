 LONDON  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were set for a subdued start on Tuesday ahead of a central bank meeting that is set to keep key rates unchanged as trading activity begins to wind down for the year. 

 Index futures for the Dow Jones industrial average DJH7, the Standard & Poor's 500 SPH7 and the Nasdaq 100 NDH7 were all slightly lower. "There were disappointing volumes last night. People are clearly beginning to wind down activity," said Steve Previs at Jefferies International. "The main event today is the FOMC meeting, and people are also looking at what the dollar does and what's happening on the bond market, as it's looking as if there's no landing at all if the economy picks up." Wall Street expects the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee to leave interest rates unchanged for the fourth straight month when its policy setters conclude their last meeting of 2006. But investors are anxious to learn what the Fed will say about economic growth and inflation. The Fed has held the fed funds rate target steady at 5.25 percent since August, when it paused after raising rates 17 times in a tightening cycle that began in June 2004. Also in focus will be shares in Citigroup Inc. ( C.N ), which fell late on Monday after it announced executive changes, and stock in Texas Instruments Inc TXN.N, the biggest maker of chips for mobile phones, fell after it cut its fourth-quarter earnings and revenue outlook. Newspapers reported that private equity firms Texas Pacific Group TPG.UL and Silver Lake Partners were near a deal on Monday to purchase travel booking service Sabre Holdings Corp TSG.N, citing people familiar with the matter. The New York Times mentioned a price tag of $4.3 billion. Oil edged higher ahead of an OPEC meeting on Thursday that may agree supply cuts. U.S. crude prices CLc1 traded 33 cents higher at $61.55 a barrel.
