 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Net overall capital inflows into the United States rose to $60.9 billion in December from an inflow of $30.7 billion the prior month, but foreigners cut purchases of long-term securities, the Treasury said on Tuesday. 

 The overall net inflow was enough to cover the December U.S. trade deficit of $40.18 billion. November's net overall inflow was initially reported at $26.6 billion. But net long-term capital inflows fell to $63.3 billion in December, down from a revised $126.4 billion inflow the prior month.
