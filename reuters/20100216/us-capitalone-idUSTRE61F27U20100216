 (Reuters) - Capital One Financial Corp's U.S. credit-card defaults rose in January, in a sign that consumers continue to remain under stress, it said in a regulatory filing. 

 Capital One said the annualized net charge-off rate -- debts the company believes it will never collect -- for U.S. credit cards rose to 10.41 percent in January from 10.14 percent in December. Accounts at least 30 days delinquent -- an indicator of future loan losses -- were up marginally to 5.80 percent from 5.78 percent. Capital One is the third-largest U.S. issuer of Visa branded credit cards, and the fifth-largest issuer of MasterCard branded credit cards. For U.S. auto loans, Capital One's charge-off rate was 4.27 percent in January, down from 5.68 percent in December, and the delinquency rate fell to 9.61 percent from 10.03 percent. In credit card international operations, including Canada and Britain, the charge-off rate fell to 9.03 percent from 9.58 percent, while the delinquency rate rose to 6.66 percent from 6.55 percent. Capital One routinely kicks off the monthly reporting of credit card charge-offs. JPMorgan Chase & Co, Bank of America Corp, Citigroup Inc, American Express Co and Discover Financial Services are expected to report the monthly performance of their credit card portfolios on Tuesday. Capital One shares closed at $35.14 Friday on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by  Brenton Cordeiro  in Bangalore; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier)
