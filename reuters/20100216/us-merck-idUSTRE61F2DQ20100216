 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Merck & Co ( MRK.N ) posted quarterly revenue ahead of analysts' estimates on Tuesday, helped by strong sales of its diabetes and allergy drugs, and stuck by its goals from its merger with Schering-Plough Corp. 

 Merck shares rose 1.7 percent as the drugmaker reported quarterly profit that matched Wall Street expectations. "The numbers look broadly speaking right in line," Deutsche Bank analyst Barbara Ryan said. "Everything looks good and on track." Merck said fourth-quarter net income was $6.5 billion, or $2.35 per share, including about two months of results from Schering-Plough after the deal closed in early November and a big gain tied to the transaction. A year earlier, stand-alone Merck reported net income of $1.64 billion, or 78 cents per share. Excluding deal-related and other special items, earnings were 79 cents per share, matching analysts' average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue was $10.09 billion, topping analysts' expectations of nearly $9.7 billion. Merck Chief Executive Richard Clark said the company remains firmly committed to its financial targets from the $41 billion Schering deal. Earlier this month, Pfizer Inc ( PFE.N ), which is digesting its own huge takeover of Wyeth, lowered its 2012 financial forecasts as analysts cited unexpectedly high spending. Combined sales of Merck's diabetes treatments Januvia and Janumet jumped 43 percent in the fourth quarter to $760 million, even as the products began to face competition from a rival drug from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co ( BMY.N ) and AstraZeneca Plc ( AZN.L ). The drugs' sales topped the expectations of Leerink Swann analyst Seamus Fernandez by $60 million. Sales of its Singulair allergy pill rose 12 percent to $1.3 billion, $44 million above the estimate of Fernandez, who said Merck's overall revenue was very strong. Combined sales of its cholesterol drugs Vytorin and Zetia, which have faced questions over safety and effectiveness, rose about 6 percent to $1.19 billion, boosted by strong growth outside the United States. "Merck's fourth-quarter results showed overall strong core product trends (including Zetia/Vytorin and Januvia) with company commentary suggesting that its merger with Schering-Plough remains very much on track," JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott said in a research note. BILLION-DOLLAR FRANCHISES In combining with New Jersey-based neighbor Schering-Plough, Merck broadened its product portfolio and greatly bolstered its research pipeline. It also expects to achieve major cost savings to help it weather looming generic competition to Singulair and other drugs. Including Schering, Merck had 10 different franchises with sales of at least $1 billion last year. Merck continues to target a high-single-digit compound annual growth rate in earnings per share, excluding items, from 2009 to 2013. The drugmaker said it expects to provide its 2010 outlook in April. One factor pressuring this year's results is that Merck expects competition from generic versions of its Cozaar/Hyzaar blood pressure drug once its U.S. patent expires in April, leading to fast erosion of the product, company officials told analysts on a conference call. Cozaar was Merck's second-biggest-selling product last year. The drugmaker stood by its previous goal of $3.5 billion in annual cost savings in 2012 as it cuts 15 percent of jobs from the combined company. Merck had about 100,000 employees at the end of the year, and plans to slash about 2,500 vacant positions as part of the initial phase of the cost cuts. Clark, who reaches the company's mandatory retirement age of 65 in March 2011, told analysts on the call that Merck is in "pretty good shape" with internal candidates to succeed him as CEO. He said he had confidence in the company's succession planning. Shares of Merck, a component of the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI , were up 62 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $37.54 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
