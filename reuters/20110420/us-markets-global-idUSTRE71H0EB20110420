 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Major stock markets rose on Wednesday after strong corporate earnings in both the United States and Europe, while gold jumped to record highs above $1,500 an ounce in a broad commodities rally. 

 Weakness in the U.S. dollar and a well-received bond auction from Spain pushed the euro to its highest in 15 months. Currencies that benefit from rising commodity prices gained, with the Australian dollar at a post-float high and the Canadian dollar hitting a 3-1/2-year high. Strong profits and outlooks from companies including chipmaker Intel bolstered economic optimism and offset concerns of sovereign debt problems on both sides of the Atlantic that heightened after Standard & Poor's on Monday downwardly revised its outlook for the United States' prized AAA credit rating. "It isn't just the good reports, but also the encouraging comments about how things look for the remainder of the year," said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. "This is a testament to the strength of earnings we can expect to come out from here," added Luschini, who helps oversee $53 billion and owns Intel shares. World equities, as measured by the MSCI All-Country World Index advanced 2 percent, extending the previous session's 0.5 percent rise and further recovering from Monday's 1.6 percent loss. Intel ( INTC.O ) posted higher than expected sales and forecast quarterly revenues well above Wall Street's estimates, while the world's biggest cosmetics group, L'Oreal ( OREP.PA ), and carmaker PSA Peugeot Citroen ( PEUP.PA ) also came in with robust figures. Major U.S. stock indexes soared. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was up 194.36 points, or 1.58 percent, at 12,460.88. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was up 17.81 points, or 1.36 percent, at 1,330.28. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was up 55.51 points, or 2.02 percent, at 2,800.26. Japan's Nikkei average  .N225  ended up 1.76 percent, snapping a three-day losing run. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  rose 1.9 percent to close at a one-week high. Emerging market stocks .MSCIEF climbed 2.3 percent. Societe Generale, however, said in a note that hedge funds were cautious on U.S. equities, keeping short positions on the S&P 500  .SPX  and the Russell 2000 .RUT, though they were net long on Japanese equities. DEBT WORRIES Gold breached $1,500 an ounce for the first time and silver hit a 31-year high. Concerns about government debt problems, inflation and turmoil in the Middle East also helped boost gold prices. Yields on 10-year Spanish government bonds fell to 5.46 percent after Spain saw solid demand for 10- and 13-year bonds at an auction, though speculation of debt restructuring by Greece forced Madrid to pay higher yields than a month ago to attract investors. The euro rose 1.3 percent versus the dollar to $1.4513, pulling further away from this week's low around $1.4155. The euro gained 1 percent to 119.58 yen. Renewed pressure on Greece to explore a debt restructuring has rattled peripheral debt markets in recent sessions, pushing Greek and Portuguese bond yields to new highs. "All in all, relatively reassuring results providing no indication Spain's decoupling from the periphery is under immediate threat. That said, the risk of contagion has certainly not been taken off the table," said Richard McGuire, rate strategist at Rabobank. Higher-yielding currencies rose, with the Australian dollar up 1.4 percent at $1.0670 after hitting a post-float high of $1.0692. Against a basket of major currencies .DXY, the U.S. dollar fell 0.9 percent to 74.370. The soft dollar boosted commodities, with copper up 2.5 percent. ICE Brent crude for June delivery rose $2.47 to $123.80 a barrel after surging to an intraday high of $124.23. U.S. June crude gained $3.09 to 111.37.
