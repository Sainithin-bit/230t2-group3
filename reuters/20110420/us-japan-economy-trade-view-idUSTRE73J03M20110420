 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's exports fell in March from a year earlier at a faster pace than economists expected in a sign that shipments will continue to weaken after last month's earthquake and tsunami sparked a nuclear crisis and disrupted supply chains for many manufacturers. 

 KEY POINTS: - Exports fell 2.2 percent in March from a year earlier, more than a median forecast for a 1.5 percent annual fall. That marked the first decline in 16 months. Imports rose 11.9 percent from a year earlier against a forecast for a 6.0 percent annual rise, trade data issued by the Finance Ministry showed. - Shipments to China rose an annual 3.8 percent while shipments to the United States fell 3.4 percent. - The trade balance came to a surplus of 196.5 billion yen, less than the median estimate for a 493.6 billion yen surplus. COMMENTARY: YOSHIMASA MARUYAMA, CHIEF ECONOMIST, ITOCHU ECONOMIC RESEARCH INSTITUTE, TOKYO "The pace of fall in exports will likely accelerate in April as automakers' production lines have not returned to normal. "On the other hand, imports will probably stay at a higher level in coming months as energy imports are expected to increase in both volume terms and value due to price increases. Imports of goods needed for production and reconstruction are also seen rising. "There is a high possibility that the trade balance will turn to a deficit in April and May but it may return to a surplus in June. But the trade deficit is likely to be only temporary and the current account will unlikely to turn to a deficit for this year, so the impact on foreign exchange rates is expected to be limited." YUICHI KODAMA, ECONOMIST, MEIJI YASUDA LIFE INSURANCE, TOKYO "The fall in exports is evidence of the damage from the earthquake and tsunami to production facilities and on export goods themselves and exports will likely continue to be depressed for the next several months, with a bigger drop seen in April than in March. "As supply chains are expected to recover in late May, the drop in exports may prove short-lived. But due to power supply constraints expected in the summer, a full pickup in exports is unlikely until at least the end of this year. "The Bank of Japan is likely to be prompted to ease its policy further in coming months. The bank may wait until all data showing the quake impact becomes available." YOSHIKI SHINKE, SENIOR ECONOMIST, DAI-ICHI LIFE RESEARCH INSTITUTE, TOKYO "The numbers are undeniably bad. Because of the natural disaster, companies can't make enough goods to ship overseas. There has also been damage to infrastructure, like ports and airports. "There hasn't been much progress in restoring factory output, so exports will fall in April. After that, it's a question of when Japan can restore its supply chain. If things go well then exports could rise in June or July. Overseas demand is also doing well, so this is a positive. "Japan's imports are likely to stay firm, because companies are importing what cannot be manufactured domestically. This could push Japan into a trade deficit in April and May. This would also subtract from gross domestic product. Restoring supply chains is the key to solving this problem." GEORGE WORTHINGTON, CHIEF ECONOMIST, ASIA-PACIFIC, IFR MARKETS, SYDNEY "The earthquake on March 11 hit Japan's exports quite hard for the month as a whole thanks to the closure of production lines in many areas, the rolling power cuts and supply chain difficulties. "These results were much weaker than expected." "The data implies a steep fall in industrial output over the month with data due out next week." BACKGROUND: - Japan is facing its worst crisis since World War Two after a 9.0 magnitude earthquake and a tsunami towering more than 10 meters battered its northeast coast on March 11, leaving nearly 28,000 dead or missing and triggering radiation leaks at a nuclear power plant. - Shortages of electricity and important parts that manufactures need to make their goods point to the possibility of deep and long-running output disruptions from Japan that could also hobble factories elsewhere in the world. - Japan's economy is expected to contract in the current quarter after the earthquake and tsunami but will grow again in July-September on reconstruction efforts, a Reuters poll showed. Some economists say gross domestic product may have contracted in January-March, meaning three straight quarters of contraction to June cannot be ruled out.
