 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co ( WFC.N ) said on Wednesday that revenue and profit at its wealth, brokerage and retirement division rose in the first quarter as fees and commissions increased with rising markets. 

 Revenue across the three businesses climbed 8 percent from a year earlier to $3.2 billion, driven largely by higher earnings from fees based on client assets, which rose 15 percent. The division's revenue made up 15.7 percent of Wells Fargo's $20.33 billion in overall first quarter revenue, roughly steady from a year ago. The division posted net income of $339 million, up 20 percent from a year earlier, and contributing 9.5 percent of the company's $3.57 billion in first quarter net income [ID:nN20133295]. Client assets in the retail brokerage business, which includes Wells Fargo Advisors, were $1.2 trillion, up 5 percent. Bank of America Corp's ( BAC.N ) Merrill Lynch reported last week that it managed $1.6 trillion in client assets at the end of the first quarter. Morgan Stanley Smith Barney ( MS.N ), the largest U.S. brokerage business, is due to report first-quarter results on Thursday. Wells Fargo's retail brokerage unit also saw an increase in client assets in managed account investments, which charge a fee based on assets rather than commissions for individual trades and generate more predictable revenue for the firm. In the first quarter, the unit had $252 billion in managed account assets, up 21 percent from a year earlier. The company added a net 48 financial advisers during the quarter and now has 15,236 advisers, leaving it in third place by headcount behind Morgan Stanley Smith Barney and Merrill Lynch. The division plans to increase efforts to target clients from other parts of the firm, according to an earnings presentation slide. Wells Fargo, the fourth-largest U.S. bank, has 5.2 million affluent customers who have $1.7 trillion in investments with other firms and no investments with the bank's wealth, brokerage and retirement unit, according to the slide.
