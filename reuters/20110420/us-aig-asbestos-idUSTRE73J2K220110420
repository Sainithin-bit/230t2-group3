 CHARLOTTE, North Carolina  (Reuters) - American International Group Inc's ( AIG.N ) Chartis unit will transfer the bulk of its asbestos liabilities to Berkshire Hathaway Inc's ( BRKa.N ) National Indemnity Co, AIG said on Wednesday. 

 AIG's global property casualty unit will cede up to $3.5 billion in potential asbestos claims to National Indemnity under a retroactive reinsurance deal. Chartis will pay $1.65 billion as part of the deal, which it said will result in a deferred pretax gain of $200 million in the second quarter of 2011. (Reporting by Joe Rauch, editing by Gerald E.
