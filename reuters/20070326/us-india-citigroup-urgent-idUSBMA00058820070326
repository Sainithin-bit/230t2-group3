 NEW DELHI  (Reuters) - Citigroup Chief Executive Charles Prince declined on Monday to comment on media reports it planned to cut 15,000 jobs to improve its performance. 

 "I have read that. I have no comments on that," Prince told reporters at a conference in New Delhi, when asked about reports of planned job cuts. "We have already said we are going to announce results of our strategic structural review on or before our earnings announcement on April 16."
