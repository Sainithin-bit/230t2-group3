 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of U.S. home builders fell more than 2 percent on Monday after a government report showed new home sales declined 3.9 percent in February. 

 The new-home sales report came only a few days after another report showed that sales of existing homes in February rose by the same percentage. The Dow Jones U.S. Home Construction Index .DJUSHB, a yardstick that measures home-builder performance, was down 2.24 percent. The only region where home sales rose was in the West. Yet, that did not protect home builders, such as Standard Pacific Corp. ( SPF.N ), which focuses on that region. Its shares, which are more thinly traded than those of its larger brethren, fell 4 percent, or 94 cents, to $22.26 percent, in late morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. JMP Securities analyst Jim Wilson said investors should not be surprised about the opposite directions the sales of existing and new homes have taken. "The pattern is (that) existing homes sales will probably be up all year. New home sales and permits will probably be down all year because there's so much existing inventory in the market," Wilson said. Right now, the average potential buyer has a vast amount and variety of choice existing homes from which to chose -- from nearly antique to nearly new. "There is inventory and the market has to absorb it otherwise there no need in the near term to build much new inventory," he said. "So that's what we're doing right now."
