 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - David Stockman, a former Reagan White House budget director and ex-head of Collins & Aikman Corp., was indicted on fraud, conspiracy and other charges on Monday, accused of misleading investors when he was chief executive of the bankrupt auto parts maker. 

 Stockman and three other former company executives are accused of orchestrating a scheme to hide the company's true financial condition when it was on the brink of collapse, according to an indictment brought by federal prosecutors in Manhattan. Four other ex-company officials have pleaded guilty to related charges, the government said. The indictment accuses Stockman and three other former executives of manipulating reported earnings and issuing false statements, as well as engaging in fraudulent rebate schemes. Stockman is also accused of trying to thwart an internal investigation into the company's rebate accounting. Stockman "hid the full truth from the company's investors and lenders," Manhattan U.S. Attorney Michael Garcia said at a news conference. He said the ex-CEO and others "resorted to lies, tricks and fraud" to boost Collins & Aikman's financial performance when they could not improve it legitimately. The indictment is a major white-collar crime case for prosecutors in Manhattan federal court, site of criminal trials of figures such as homemaking icon Martha Stewart and former WorldCom chief Bernard Ebbers in recent years. Stockman, a former Michigan congressman, was head of the Office of Management and Budget during the Reagan administration. There, he became famous as a promoter of supply-side economic policies, dubbed "Reaganomics." Stockman, in a statement posted on his lawyer's Web site, called the charges implausible. He said he did everything he could to salvage the company, including moving into a motel next to the headquarters, working long hours without pay and personally absorbing millions of dollars in company expenses. "The government's case amounts to a crimeless prosecution that I intend to vigorously challenge because I did nothing wrong," said Stockman, 60, who lives in Greenwich, Connecticut. Stockman left the company five days before it filed for bankruptcy in May 2005. He said he and his private equity fund took the largest single loss -- $360 million -- from the company's collapse. Stockman, former Chief Financial Officer J. Michael Stepp, former controller David Cosgrove and ex-purchasing director Paul Barnaba were charged with crimes including conspiracy and securities fraud in an indictment unsealed on Monday. Prosecutors said the alleged fraud lasted from December 2001 until the company filed for bankruptcy. All four pleaded not guilty in U.S. Magistrate's Court on Monday afternoon. Stockman, who also was charged with wire fraud, bank fraud and obstruction, was released on a $1 million bond. Stepp, Cosgrove and Barnaba were released on bonds of $500,000 apiece. Stepp's attorney, Vince DiBlasi, said the charges involve "the minutiae of rebate accounting. Mr. Stepp is not an accountant and never worked as one." Collins & Aikman was not charged with any crimes. Garcia said his office had reached a non-prosecution agreement with the company, which has agreed to continue to cooperate with the government in its investigation. Separately, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission brought civil charges against Stockman and eight other individuals connected to the company. The SEC said the company had settled charges against it, without admitting or denying the allegations. The agreement requires court approval. Stockman became a private equity investor after leaving government. He joined Collins & Aikman in 2002, soon after Heartland Industrial Partners, a buyout fund that he co-founded in 1999, bought a controlling stake in the company. Collins & Aikman is in the process of selling its remaining assets. A Collins & Aikman representative was not immediately available to comment on the indictments.
