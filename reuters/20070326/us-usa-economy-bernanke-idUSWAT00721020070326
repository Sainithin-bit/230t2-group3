 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said in a letter released on Monday that China's accumulation of U.S. debt is not a problem for the United States or for the Fed's conduct of monetary policy. 

 "Because foreign holdings of U.S. Treasury securities represent only a small part of total U.S. credit market debt outstanding, U.S. credit markets should be able to absorb without great difficulty any shift of foreign allocations," he said in a letter to Sen. Richard Shelby, an Alabama Republican.
