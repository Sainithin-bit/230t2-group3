 BOSTON  (Reuters) - HealthSouth Corp. ( HLS.N ), the nation's largest rehabilitation services provider, said on Monday it has agreed to sell its surgery division to the privately held investment firm TPG for $945 million as it continues to focus on its inpatient rehabilitation hospital business. 

 HealthSouth, which is attempting to reorganize after a multibillion-dollar accounting scandal, said several senior executives, including Mike Snow, its chief operating officer, and Joe Clark, president of the surgery division, will leave HealthSouth to join the newly formed company. The sale comes two months after HealthSouth agreed to sell its outpatient rehabilitation division to privately held Select Medical Corp. for about $245 million, part of a continuing bid to pay down roughly $3.3 billion in debt. "Today's announcement marks a major milestone in the strategic repositioning of HealthSouth as a post-acute health-care provider," said Jay Grinney, HealthSouth chief executive officer. "The proceeds from this transaction will be used to pay down a significant portion of our long-term debt." The Birmingham, Alabama-based company also plans to sell its diagnostics unit by as early as the end of the first quarter. The price being paid by TPG for the surgery division consists of about $920 million in cash and an equity interest in the newly formed company estimated to be worth $25 million to $30 million assuming a five-year horizon. HealthSouth's surgery division is comprised of a network of 139 outpatient surgery centers and three surgical hospitals in 35 states. Goldman, Sachs & Co. served as HealthSouth's financial adviser for the transaction.
