 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Package delivery company United Parcel Service Inc. said on Monday it has launched a service that allows customers to intercept or reroute packages once they are sent but before they are delivered. 

 "This service allows us to create flexibility and a kind of insurance policy for customers in a world of tight deadlines," Kurt Kuehn, UPS senior vice president for worldwide sales and technology, told Reuters. Officials at UPS' main rival, FedEx Corp., said their company has always offered rerouting options, but not as a guaranteed service. UPS, the world's largest package delivery company, is officially rolling out the service, called UPS Delivery Intercept, in the United States on Monday but has been testing it for some weeks, Kuehn said. Customers who want to change the delivery address or halt delivery of a package that has been shipped but not yet delivered can do so using UPS' Web site or by phoning the company. The service is available around the clock. Kuehn cited the example of one UPS user who, during the test phase of the new service, shipped double orders to a customer and was able to intercept one order, avoiding the embarrassment of having both orders delivered. "Also, if you send out a business presentation and realize you have the wrong figures in there, you can intercept it before it gets to your client," he added. Kuehn described the service as "unique" and said UPS would gain a competitive advantage in the package delivery business because of the degree of control it will give customers over their packages. FedEx spokeswoman Carla Boyd said the company's express and ground delivery units, FedEx Express and FedEx Ground, have always offered rerouting options to customers. "This is not a guaranteed service," he said, "but it is an option we have offered customers since day one." Atlanta, Georgia-based UPS delivers about 15 million packages a day worldwide. Memphis, Tennessee-based FedEx handles more than 6 million a day.
