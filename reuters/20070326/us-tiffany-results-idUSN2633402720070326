 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Luxury jeweler Tiffany & Co. ( TIF.N ) on Monday reported quarterly earnings that edged past Wall Street estimates, and said it was on track to meet its first-quarter earnings forecast, as sales growth was above expectations so far. 

 Quarterly sales, particularly of its higher-end diamond jewelry, were strong across the United States and in most international markets other than Japan in the past quarter, Tiffany said. Net income for the fourth quarter ended January 31 was $140.5 million, or $1.02 per share, compared with $140.3 million, or 97 cents per share, a year earlier. The latest earnings included a charge of 5 cents a share related to its Little Switzerland Inc. stores -- which are duty-free stores in the Caribbean, Key West and Alaska. Analysts, on average, expected earnings of $1.05 per share excluding one-time items, according to Reuters Estimates. The company's net results were not a surprise, said Stifel Nicolas analyst David Schick, who has a "hold" rating on the stock. "Tiffany has expanded its exposure to the rough cut diamond business," Schick said. "Because of that and because of (increased) precious metal costs and raw material costs it is not unexpected that sales were a little better and gross margins reported a little worse." Sales rose 15 percent to $986.4 million, with its flagship store in New York City reporting a 17 percent sales increase, as more tourists took advantage of stronger foreign currencies, spokesman Mark Aaron said during a conference call. Japan sales suffered due to slower overall consumer spending, Aaron said. The company is on track to meet its first-quarter earnings forecast given strong Valentine's Day sales and better-than-expected sales throughout its markets in the past two months, Chief Executive Michael Kowalski said. "We've noted a greater-than-expected shift in sales mix toward higher-end, lower-margin diamond jewelry," he said. For all of 2007, the company expects earnings per share to increase by 15 percent, and net sales to increase between 11 percent and 12 percent on a high-single-digit increase in U.S. and international same-store sales -- sales at stores open at least a year. Tiffany shares were down 48 cents, to $45.02, in morning New York Stock Exchange trading. The shares are near the high-water mark of their 52-week range of $45.98 to 29.63.
