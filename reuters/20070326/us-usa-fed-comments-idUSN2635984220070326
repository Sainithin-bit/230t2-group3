 * ST LOUIS FED PRESIDENT WILLIAM POOLE, MARCH 5: 

 "To me, and, I believe, the mainstream of forecasters both in government and out, we do not see a recession on the horizon," Poole said in answer to a question after speaking to a business audience in Santiago, Chile. "Moreover, beyond our own judgments on that as forecasters, I don't think that the markets see (recession)," he added. * FED BOARD GOVERNOR RANDALL KROSZNER, MARCH 5: ""The numbers do suggest stabilization in the housing market recently. But whenever there is a market that is in transition, there is always some uncertainty about that direction," he told an audience after giving a speech on community banks in Washington. * FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN BEN BERNANKE, March 2: "When the offsetting effects of globalization on the prices of manufactured imports and on energy and commodity prices are considered together, there seems to be little basis for concluding that globalization overall has significantly reduced inflation in the United States in recent years; indeed the opposite may be true," he said in a speech at Stanford University.
