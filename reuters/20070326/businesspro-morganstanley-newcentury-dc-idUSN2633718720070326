 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) is auctioning 
$2.48 billion of mortgages from troubled subprime lender New 
Century Financial Inc. ( NEWC.PK ), the New York Post said on 
Monday. 

  The loans represent collateral that New Century gave the 
investment bank for a $2.5 billion credit line, the newspaper 
said.  Morgan Stanley did not immediately return a call seeking 
comment.  Subprime lenders make loans to people with poor credit 
histories. Many are struggling with rising delinquencies and 
defaults. At least four large subprime lenders have sought 
bankruptcy protection since late December.  Two weeks ago, Irvine, California-based New Century stopped 
making loans, and said it had less than $60 million of cash on 
hand. Many analysts have said the company appears on the brink 
of bankruptcy.  At least two other large subprime lenders, Accredited Home 
Lenders Holding Co. LEND.O and Fremont General Corp. FMT.N 
this month announced agreements to sell many of their subprime 
loans at a discount.
