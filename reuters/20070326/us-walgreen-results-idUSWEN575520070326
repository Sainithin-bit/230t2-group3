 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Walgreen Co. ( WAG.N ), one of the largest U.S. drugstore chains, posted a better-than-expected 25 percent increase in quarterly profit on Monday, boosted by strong holiday sales and continued growth in prescription drugs. 

 The company also said a greater percentage of prescription sales came from more profitable generic drugs, while the mix of general merchandise sales shifted to higher-margin items. Walgreen shares rose almost 3 percent in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, before drifting lower amid a wider market decline. The stock is up more than 7 percent since March 14. "The changing prescription mix was a nice tailwind, but the strong performance was also the result of better store productivity," Mitchell Corwin, analyst at Morningstar, said in a research note. Profit rose to $651.9 million, or 65 cents per share, in the second quarter, ended on February 28, from $523.5 million, or 51 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts, on average, expected the Deerfield, Illinois-based chain to earn 61 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 14.6 percent to $13.93 billion, while sales at stores open at least a year increased 8.9 percent. Prescription sales rose 16.4 percent and accounted for 62.4 percent of total sales, the company said. "Our growth in retail prescriptions filled in the quarter continued to outpace the growth in both the retail pharmacy and mail service pharmacy industries," Chief Executive Jeffrey Rein said in a news release. The aging baby boomer population has been a boon for drugstores as older consumers tend to take more prescription medicines. Gross margin rose to 28.96 percent from 28.44 a year earlier. Derek Leckow, analyst at Barrington Research, said the quarter showed Walgreen's continued strength, saying that it was "remarkable" that a company the size of Walgreen would post a 25 percent earnings increase, which Walgreen has in the past three quarters. "The company has a lot of momentum and I feel like they are executing very well right now," he said. Walgreen has expanded at a rapid clip by opening new stores and buying small companies. It had 5,641 stores as of February 28, up from 5,156 a year earlier, and aims to have more than 7,000 in 2010. Rival CVS/Caremark Corp. ( CVS.N ) had 6,196 stores as of February 24. The stock was down 0.5 percent at midday Monday, less than the 0.65 percent decline of the Standard & Poor's 500 index   .SPX . The stock trades at about 20.5 times next year's expected earnings, while CVS trades at a multiple of about 15.8, according to Reuters data.
