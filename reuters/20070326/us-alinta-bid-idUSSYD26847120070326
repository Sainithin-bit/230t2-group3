 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Australian energy infrastructure group Alinta Ltd. AAN.AX was evaluating separate bids on Monday from investment firms Macquarie Bank Ltd. MBL.AX and Babcock & Brown Ltd. BNB.AX, sources familiar with the situation said. 

 Perth-based Alinta, which is also considering plans for an internal restructure, has given itself two days to look at the proposals and said there was no certainty it would recommend either bid. Babcock partnered Singapore Power's local infrastructure firm SP Ausnet ( SPN.AX ) to lodge a bid late on Friday, the sources said. Macquarie also lodged a proposal, although its consortium partner Leighton Holdings ( LEI.AX ) dropped out, they added. A third consortium, Wesfarmers Ltd. WES.AX and Hong Kong's Cheung Kong Infrastructure Ltd. (CKI) ( 1038.HK ), had dropped out of the bid process, local media reports said. "You've got two bids which they need to go through and look at in conjunction with the internal restructuring. There is a genuine hope they can resolve it in the next two days," one source told Reuters. Alinta said in a statement it had requested further information to evaluate the proposals. Babcock and its partner were believed to have made a cash offer at a discount to Alinta's share price, planning to delist the company and carve it up, The Australian Financial Review newspaper said Monday. Macquarie was reported to have made a more complex offer at a higher price, involving a restructure and the creation of a new listed entity, the newspaper said. Shares in Alinta, which have jumped more than 26 percent since the gas and power utility received a management buyout proposal on January 9, closed at A$14.15 on Friday. Alinta, with a market capitalization of about A$7 billion ($5.6 billion), has a stable of gas transmission pipelines and a lucrative asset management division, which operates and maintains all the distribution and transmission assets. Alinta, which competes against about 10 other players including Macquarie and Babcock & Brown, last month posted a 26 percent drop in year net profit to A$172.7 million ($137 million) from A$232.2 million a year earlier when it had a one-off gain. Excluding the one-off, profit rose 37 percent. ($1=A$1.24)
