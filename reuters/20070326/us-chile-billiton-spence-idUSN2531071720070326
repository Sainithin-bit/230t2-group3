 SANTIAGO  (Reuters) - BHP Billiton, the world's biggest miner, said on Sunday that its recently launched Spence copper project in Chile will produce 180,000 tonnes of copper cathodes in 2007. 

 The $1 billion project started production in December 2006 and will produce 200,000 tonnes of copper cathodes per year after it hits design capacity in the third quarter of this year, BHP Billiton Chief Executive Officer Chip Goodyear said in the Chilean capital Santiago. The leaching operation uses the SX/EW process (solvent extraction and electro-winning) and is the first large-scale greenfield mining project to be developed in Chile in six years. Goodyear said the project was special because it applied a number of technologies that have never been applied before in the resource business. "A hundred percent of its cranes are automatic. It has a radio frequency identification system on each and every cathode that identifies where that cathode came from and the quality aspects," he said at a meeting with journalists. The Spence project will raise Billiton's copper production in Chile by 15 percent, raising its capacity in the Andean nation to 1.7 million tonnes. Chile is the world's largest source of copper and is also home to Billiton's Escondida mine, the world's largest copper mine.
