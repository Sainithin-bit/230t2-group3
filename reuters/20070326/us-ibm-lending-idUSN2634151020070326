 BOSTON  (Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp. ( IBM.N ) said on Monday it formed a unit that will sell software and computers for processing mortgage applications and also manage processing of home-loan paperwork on behalf of lenders. 

 IBM, the world's No. 2 computer services company, will offer technology to help process mortgage applications, automating the complexities of collecting documents to complete loans. IBM, which will base the new business in Charlotte, North Carolina, will sell software, hardware and consulting services to large lenders that will use them in their own computer centers. The new business will also offer a mortgage processing service where it will take full responsibility for processing a loan after the application is completed, collecting and reviewing all paperwork that an underwriter needs before deciding whether to make a loan. Processing a mortgage generally takes at least a month as lenders gather myriad documents ranging from original loan applications to real estate appraisals, credit reports and flood certifications. IBM's products use digital imaging, optical character recognition and other computer technologies to pull those records into one package that underwriters can review when deciding whether to approve loans. The unit will also offer smaller lenders the option of running those products off of computers in IBM's own data centers. IBM will also offer outsourced loan processing services, where its own employees will handle the processing of a mortgage from the time a loan application is completed until all the necessary documents are compiled into a package that is ready for consideration by an underwriter.
