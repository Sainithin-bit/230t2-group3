 MELBOURNE  (Reuters) - Australian retailer Coles Group Ltd. CGJ.AX said on Monday its sale plans are having little impact on the group's planned overhaul. 

 Coles said earlier on Monday it is considering all options for the A$20 billion ($16 billion) sale of the company. "The ownership review is having only a marginal impact on some elements of the transformation" Chief Executive John Fletcher told a media briefing. Chairman Rick Allert said people should not expect a "day by day, blow by blow" update of progress on the sale process. Coles said it would consider bids for all of the group, and consider a potential demerger of the Target and Officeworks chains and would also consider the sale of a major stake in its Everyday Needs business.
