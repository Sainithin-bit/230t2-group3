 MELBOURNE  (Reuters) - Australian retailer Coles Group Ltd. CGJ.AX on Monday flagged a possible break-up in a A$20 billion sale plan, propelling its shares to a record. 

 Australia's second-largest retailer, which put itself up for sale last month, hopes to maximize the price with a potential breakup of the company into three parts: supermarkets, office supplies and retailing. The announcement came as Coles reported a slowdown in sales growth at its supermarkets and a loss of market share. Chairman Rick Allert warned people not to expect a "blow-by-blow" update on progress on the sale, which he said was likely to take close to six months, and analyst David Spry at broker FW Holst said this made sense. "These assets don't come up for sale every day, there's a lot of interest and the company is going to have to evaluate all the offers," said Spry. Private equity firms and local and international retail trade buyers are expected to take a look at Coles and its businesses. Coles said it would consider bids for the entire group, or separate bids for each of the core supermarkets business, the Officeworks business supplies chain and discount retailer Target. It is also considering a potential demerger of Target and Officeworks, and the sale of a major stake in its "everyday needs" business, which comprises the supermarkets, liquor stores and discounter Kmart, while keeping it as a listed company. A break-up of Coles would allow retailers who are not large enough to bid for the entire group to buy one of its better-performing units. Larger rival Woolworths Ltd. ( WOW.AX ) and Harvey Norman ( HVN.AX ) have expressed interest in Officeworks, which could fetch more than A$1 billion, and trade buyers including Solomon Lew's Premier Investments are likely to be interested in Target, which could fetch more than A$3 billion. In an apparent concession to a six-party consortium led by private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co KKR.UL that is sizing up a bid for the retailer, Coles said it would limit the number of members in one bidding syndicate to six -- above the limit of four it was initially considering. "There is a realization there that KKR is probably ... the only one capable of cashing out the whole thing," a source familiar with the situation said. The rules are intended to maximize competition for the business. Allert said preparations were well underway for due diligence, including a dataroom to be made available in about three weeks to "selected" interested bidders. "They've got to be careful, they can't put in a set of conditions that restricts the price for Coles," cautioned Shaw Stockbroking analyst Scott Marshall. MARKET SHARE SHRINKING Details of the sale overshadowed Coles' first-half results, which confirmed the further loss of market share to Woolworths. Net profit for the six months to January 28 edged up to A$501.3 million from A$484.5 million, in line with the retailer's forecast of a A$501 million profit. That was above market expectations of A$490 million, according to a Reuters survey of five analysts. Food and liquor sales from continuing businesses rose just 2.4 percent, below the rate of inflation and well below the 9.7 percent growth rate at Woolworths in the first half. Results were hurt by disappointing sales at Bi-Lo stores that have been converted to Coles. As a result, Coles said on Monday the rebranding of Bi-Lo stores was now on hold. Same-store sales at the struggling Kmart chain fell 4.2 percent in the first half, and earnings dropped 22 percent, while same store sales at Target rose 2.8 percent and Officeworks declined 3.1 percent. Coles said its forecast profit for this year and next was unchanged from February, when it slashed the 2008 net profit forecast by 10 percent and first said it was considering a sale. Profit for 2007 is expected to be flat, while Woolworths is forecasting a 20-24 percent increase. Coles shares last traded up 1.5 percent at A$16.24 after touching a record of A$16.28.
