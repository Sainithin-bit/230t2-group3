 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - An executive who paid more than $500 million to buy dozens of small U.S. newspapers from former media magnate Conrad Black's company testified on Monday at Black's fraud trial that he balked when asked at one point to wire $9.5 million directly to Black and his associates. 

 A handwritten asterisk on the closing documents in a 2000 sale of eight to 10 newspapers from Black's Hollinger International Inc. to Community Newspaper Holdings Inc. directed that $4.5 million in non-compete payments be transferred to Black, another $4.5 million to partner David Radler, and $250,000 each to two of Black's co-defendants, the jury heard. "The deal was with Hollinger International. We thought that was where the proceeds were supposed to go," said Michael Reed, the former chief executive of the Birmingham, Alabama-based newspaper group, which in all bought more than 100 Hollinger-owned papers over the years. "It just didn't seem like the right thing to do," Reed said, adding that he refused to honor the request from Black's co-defendant, Hollinger lawyer Mark Kipnis, to wire a total of $9.5 million from the $92 million sale directly to Black and co-defendants John Boultbee and Mark Atkinson. It was not clear from testimony if Black and the others ever got the money from that particular deal, though he and his three co-defendants are accused of absconding with $60 million through similar transactions. Prosecutors contend the non-compete agreement money should have gone to Hollinger International -- the media giant Black built and later disassembled -- and to its shareholders. U.S.-based Hollinger International was later renamed the Sun-Times Media Group Inc.. The Canadian-born Black, 62, is also accused of abusing company perks, obstruction of justice and tax fraud. If convicted, he could spend the rest of his life in prison, ordered to pay millions in fines and forfeit $92 million in assets. Radler has pleaded guilty to a lesser charge and is expected to testify against Black and his three co-defendants during the trial in U.S. District Court. Reed also described his company's initial purchase of roughly 100 Hollinger-owned U.S. papers for $456 million in 1998. Late in the negotiations, Hollinger Inc., a Canadian company closely controlled by Black, was added to a non-compete arrangement, entitling it to part of the $50 million designated for that purpose, he said. Non-compete payments, which are central to the case, preclude the seller of newspapers from going back into the same newspaper market where it has sold a property. Prosecutors contend such payments were pocketed by Black and the others instead of going to Hollinger International. Under cross-examination by Black's lawyer, Reed agreed that it was really none of his concern how non-compete payments were allocated, as long as they did not raise the sale price of the newspapers. "It was none of your business," lawyer Ed Genson said, and Reed agreed.
