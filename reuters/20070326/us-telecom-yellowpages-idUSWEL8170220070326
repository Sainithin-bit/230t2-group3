 WELLINGTON  (Reuters) - New Zealand's Telecom Corp. ( TEL.NZ ) said on Monday it would sell its directories group to a private equity consortium for NZ$2.24 billion ($1.59 billion) and return part of the proceeds to shareholders, sending its shares up 2 percent. 

 A consortium of private equity firms CCMP Capital and Canadian pension fund Teachers' Private Capital would pay around 14 times of expected 2007 earnings for the group, which consists of printed and online versions of the yellow and white pages directories. Last year, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts KKR.UL and Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) paid 15.3 times earnings, 3.3 billion euros ($4.4 billion) for France's Yellow Pages unit, PagesJaunes PAJ.PA. Analysts said the long-awaited sale opened the way for Telecom to return at least NZ$1 billion to shareholders -- which would equate to about 50 NZ cents a share, or just over 10 percent of the current share price of NZ$4.76. "Historically Telecom has managed itself in a way that it pays good cash returns to its equity holders," said BBY analyst Mark McDonnell. He said Telecom had a number of capital management issues to consider, such as whether it wanted to use some of the proceeds to retire debt or increase investment in network infrastructure. Telecom said it would announce the final structure of its capital management plan at its third-quarter briefing on May 3. "You are looking at a sizeable return of capital that needs to be planned carefully," Chief Financial Officer Marko Bogoievski told a briefing. The method of returning the capital has yet to be decided but analysts said a share buyback rather than a special dividend was preferable because it would boost Telecom's earnings per share. Shares in Telecom, New Zealand's largest-listed company and only full-service telecommunications provider, last traded up 9 cents or 1.9 percent to NZ$4.77. TOP PRICE Telecom said it regarded the NZ$2.24 billion price, which was in the middle of analysts' expectations, as a good price. "The board is satisfied that the transaction fairly reflects the underlying value of the YPG business," Chairman Wayne Boyd said in a statement. Telecom has previously said Yellow Pages would have earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of NZ$160 million for the year to June 2007. BBY's McDonnell said the scope for future growth was a big factor in Telecom achieving the top end of market expectations. Other known bidders were CVC Asia Pacific CVC.UL, a consortium of KKR and Australian broadcaster Seven Network Holdings Ltd SEV.AX, and a joint bid between Bain Capital and Pacific Equity Partners. Directories businesses are popular with private equity buyers because of their strong cashflows. ($1=NZ$1.41)
