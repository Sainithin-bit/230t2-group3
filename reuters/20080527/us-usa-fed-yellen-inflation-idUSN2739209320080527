 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Market-based inflation expectations have risen recently but have not become unmoored, and the Federal Reserve intends to keep it that way, San Francisco Fed President Janet Yellen said on Tuesday. 

 Talking to reporters after a speech in San Francisco, Yellen said the central bank's policy was the "barrier" that would prevent a repeat of spiraling 1970s-style inflation. "The Fed allowed inflation to build in the 1970s -- we can't do that," Yellen said. Yellen repeated her assertion that the Fed had cut rates far enough, and said that although more weak economic data could be expected, it would not automatically translate into the need for further reductions to rates. Rate increases are still "down the road," she added. Some data recently had shown a mild upside surprise, Yellen said, adding that consumer spending has held up better than expected despite the "huge toll on households" from high energy costs.
