 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Target Corp ( TGT.N ) said on Tuesday that it is launching Sami Hayek for Target, an exclusive limited-edition collection by the designer that includes bedding, furniture and stationery. 

 Discount retailer Target said the collection is designed for students and is hitting its stores in time for the "back to college" shopping season. The products range in price from 99 cents for a mini composition book to $149.99 for an office desk, Target said. (Reporting by  Nicole Maestri , editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
