 DUBAI  (Reuters) - Vodafone Qatar, an affiliate of Britain's Vodafone Group Plc ( VOD.L ), will pay 7.72 billion riyals ($2.12 billion) for the Gulf state's second mobile phone license, the country's regulator said on Tuesday. 

 The company, which includes state-owned Qatar Foundation, will sell shares to the public in or before November and start operations in the first quarter, Qatar's Supreme Council of Information & Technology said in a statement. (Writing by  John Irish ; Editing by James Cordahi)
