 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - The extent of upcoming weakness in U.S. housing prices is still a key question for the economic outlook, San Francisco Fed President Janet Yellen said on Tuesday. 

 Yellen said falling house prices still have the potential to create an "adverse feedback loop" as lower household wealth pulls down consumer sentiment and more Americans put the brakes on retail spending. Answering audience questions after a speech to a financial planning conference, Yellen said the additional credit risk assumed by the Fed in recent months had been "quite minimal." Even so, opening the Fed's discount window lending facility to investment banks as a way to pump liquidity into the financial system raised the risks of "moral hazard," she said.
