 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Investors responded nervously on Tuesday to news that the head of struggling German chipmaker Infineon ( IFXGn.DE ) was leaving after a dispute over strategy. 

 Many saw the departure of Wolfgang Ziebart as a signal that Infineon was edging towards a merger with rival NXP -- a deal that Ziebart had opposed and one which many investors do not want. Analysts said Infineon's new management, which will be led by former Siemens manager and long-time Infineon board member Peter Bauer, was also against such a deal. Ziebart left after an increasingly public spat with chairman Max Dietrich Kley, who had pressed for more urgent action to reverse losses at the chipmaker. But shares in Infineon tumbled as some company watchers speculated that Kley would push through a deal with private-equity-owned NXP. Infineon's stock was the biggest loser on the blue-chip DAX  .GDAXI , down more than 3.3 percent at 1107 GMT. "Infineon's management board will shrink from 5 to 4 members, with no real CEO," wrote Bernd Laux, an analyst with Cheuvreux. "Furthermore, Kley's influence on the group's operating management has increased further." "Such a combination, apparently the favored solution of Kley, would merge two struggling, Europe-centric chipmakers, which we do not find particularly complementary." His comments were mirrored by others who said that such a deal would do little to help Infineon, which is facing fierce competition in the market for chips and grappling with its stake in loss-making Qimonda. Infineon said on Monday that Ziebart, who has led the company for four years, would step down on June 1. The company said it had a program to improve profit margins, details of which would be worked out in the coming weeks. Analysts expect more details after a capital market day next Tuesday. Ziebart had failed to produce a full-year profit at Infineon during his tenure and comes as fraught chipmakers battle with a prolonged industry downturn. Infineon's automotive, industrial and multi-market division is the only consistently profitable part of the company. (Reporting by  Sylvia Westall ; Editing by Paul Bolding)
