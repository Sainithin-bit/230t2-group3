 LONDON  (Reuters) - Vodafone Group's ( VOD.L ) chief executive Arun Sarin will announce on Tuesday that he will step down in July and hand over to his deputy, Vittorio Colao, Britain's Daily Telegraph newspaper reported. 

 The timing of Sarin's departure, after five years in charge of the British-based mobile phone group, will be announced alongside record headline full-year profits of about 13 billion pounds ($25.71 billion) and will surprise analysts and investors, the paper said. No one at Vodafone was available for comment. Colao currently runs Vodafone's European operations. (Writing by Tim Pearce) ($1=.5056 Pound)
