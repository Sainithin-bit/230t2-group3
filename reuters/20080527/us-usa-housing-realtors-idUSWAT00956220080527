 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department and National Association of Realtors agreed to settle a lawsuit over who has access to its listings of houses for sale, the department said on Tuesday. 

 Under the agreement, the National Association of Realtors must allow Internet-based real estate brokers access to its multiple listing services, the government said in a statement. The Justice Department said the settlement would give consumers more choice and lower commission rates. A lawsuit challenging the industry group's control of its multiple listing services was filed by the government in 2005. (Reporting by Randy Mikklesen,  Diane Bartz )
