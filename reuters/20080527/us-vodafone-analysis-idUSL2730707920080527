 LONDON/AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - After grappling for two years with mature European markets, Vodafone's ( VOD.L ) new boss will have to turn his sights on booming emerging economies where customers could cut spending as food prices rise. 

 Analysts welcomed Tuesday's announcement that Arun Sarin, the chief executive of the world's largest mobile phone group by revenue, is to be replaced by his deputy Vittorio Colao.  Sarin's departure will not mark a major strategic shift for Vodafone, which like other telecoms groups is also trying to find its place in an uncertain digital future, experimenting with mobile advertising and fixed and wireless broadband. Colao, 46, currently heads Vodafone's European businesses that are under pressure from regulator-imposed cuts in roaming and interconnection rates, making a tight grip on costs a priority. Add to that macro-economic woes. "In a place like Egypt, you are seeing basic foodstuffs going up by more than 20 percent," said Paul Donovan, who leads Vodafone's business in Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia. "We are not seeing an impact yet on the business, but if this continues, given the very large amount of people's disposable income spent on food, that has the potential to take the edge off some of the expenditure that we're seeing." Collins Stewart analyst Mark James struck a cautiously optimistic note on emerging markets. "All telecoms spend is a function of the economy. That said, I've continually been surprised by people's propensity to spend on telephony," he said. "Especially in emerging markets, people's ability to spend a disproportionate amount of disposable income on telecoms has historically been quite strong." NOT IN A HURRY Analysts said Colao may also be prodded to revisit some of Vodafone's existing strategic issues, such as a minority stake in Verizon Wireless, a joint venture with Verizon Communications Inc ( VZ.N ) that has not paid a dividend in years. "My feeling is that he is not in opposition to Arun Sarin, and not in a hurry to do things another way," an analyst based in continental Europe said, asking not to be named. Sal. Oppenheim analyst Wolfgang Specht said Colao had handled the challenge of running Vodafone's operations in mature western European markets well. "That's definitely a tougher job than running a still growing emerging markets business," Specht said, noting Colao also had experience in dealing with regulators -- a skill that could come in handy given the tougher attitude of the European Union's top telecoms regulator, Viviane Reding. Reding last year forced operators to cut the costs of making and receiving calls abroad, and is threatening similar moves for text messaging and mobile data. Regulators are also imposing price cuts on what carriers can charge for calls originating on another network within a country, so-called termination rates. In Germany, for instance, Vodafone's voice revenue dropped by more than 8 percent in the 2007/2008 fiscal year even as the amount of outgoing voice minutes went up by 32 percent. ING analyst Damien Chew said other strategic questions included if Vodafone should seek to buy control of French mobile operator SFR, a joint venture controlled by Vivendi ( VIV.PA ), and if it should expand its fixed-line broadband business or push mobile data as an alternative. Vodafone shares the challenge with other telecoms companies that its business gets invaded by companies such as Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ) -- which is pushing into services -- and Internet companies such as Google ( GOOG.O ). Sarin has argued that carriers must resist becoming mere transporters of data, and must be in active in all areas where its customers communicate, be it via phone calls and text messages or email and social networks. Colao will likely approach such problems in his typical manner, with an open mind and a way of thinking that is almost scientific, said a person close to him: "Everyone has the right to be listened to before he decides, and then he decides very quickly."
