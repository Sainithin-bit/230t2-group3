 DETROIT/MOSCOW  (Reuters) - Canadian auto parts supplier Magna International Inc. MGa.TO said on Thursday it had secured a $1.54 billion investment from a firm controlled by Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska in a move aimed first at expansion in the fast-growing Russian auto market. 

 The cash infusion could also help Magna fund a bid to buy struggling U.S. automaker Chrysler Group from its German corporate parent Daimler DCXGn.DE in ongoing talks in which Magna has been seen by many analysts as the front runner. Shares of Magna, which also reported a 2.8 rise in first-quarter earnings, jumped almost 7 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange early Thursday afternoon. The complicated deal, which must be approved by shareholders and regulators, would give Deripaska and Magna founder Frank Stronach joint control of the diversified auto supplier through a new holding company. Deripaska also owns Russia's No. 2 automaker Gaz ( GAZA.RTS ), maker of the Volga saloon and the Gazelle minivan. JP Morgan analyst Himanshu Patel said the proposed structure could allow Stronach and Deripaska to buy Chrysler through the holding company, a move that would keep Magna's parts business separate and minimize the risk to the company's sales to other auto companies. "This deal could provide a creative platform to realize Stronach's interest in Chrysler," Patel said in a note for clients. Magna Chief Executive Don Walker declined to discuss the company's pending bid for Chrysler but said Russia's Gaz could be part of expansion plans that could give Chrysler a low-cost manufacturing base and new sales opportunities. "Any car company is looking at how they can expand market share and distribution so that is something that would be discussed, I'm sure," he told analysts and reporters on a conference call. Stronach has said Magna has a partnership with Canadian buyout firm Onex Corp. ( OCX.TO ) aimed at buying a stake in DaimlerChrysler's DCXGn.DE Chrysler division. Magna said it expect Russian auto production to grow by 50 percent over the four years ending in 2010 as Gaz and foreign car companies tool up to take advantage of rising incomes and relatively low vehicle ownership rates. Russia's auto components sector is projected to reach $30 billion in annual sales by 2010, a spokesman for Deripaska's firm Basic Element said. Deripaska, 39, was ranked Russia's second-richest man by Forbes magazine, behind Roman Abramovich. Deripaska built much of his estimated $16.8 billion fortune in aluminum, emerging from Russia's "aluminum wars" of the 1990s with control of some of the country's biggest smelters. Deripaska also masterminded the consolidation of Russia's aluminum sector, which was completed in March with the creation of United Company RUSAL. That new company, in which Deripaska is the majority owner, produces an eighth of the world's supply of the metal. NEW HOLDING COMPANY CREATED Under the Magna investment agreement, Russian Machines, a unit of Basic Element would buy 20 million newly issued Class A shares of Magna at $76.83 per share. A Canadian holding company would be created to combine the equity holdings in Magna of the Stronach Trust, Russian Machines and certain members of Magna's executive management. Russian Machines and Stronach would each have the right to nominate six directors each to the new company with the two chief executive officers of Magna also serving on the 14-member board, the company said. In addition, Russian Machines agreed to invest $150 million in a separate firm affiliated with Stronach order to collect half of the consulting fees Magna pays out to its founder. Stronach maintains control of Magna through ownership of Class B shares that now represent over 80 percent of voting rights in the company. In conjunction with the deal, Magna said it planned to repurchase all Class B shares not held by the Stronach Trust for C$114 in cash at a total cost of about C$24.8 million. After closing, Magna said it would also look to buy back up to 20 million Class A shares to offset the new equity being issued to the Russian firm. The net result of the changes would be that common shareholders would see their voting rights in Magna increase from one-sixth of the total votes now to roughly one-third after the deal, the company said. Magna said it would continue to be a Canada-based company, with shares listed on the Toronto and New York stock exchanges. The Russian investment deal could close in the third quarter of this year at a special meeting of Magna shareholders, executives said. Magna has been seen as a leading bidder for Chrysler, which accounts for some 12 percent of its sales, in part because it is expected to face less opposition from the automaker's unions than private equity companies also interested in the sale. Magna on Thursday posted first-quarter earnings of $218 million on revenue of $6.4 billion, up 7 percent from a year earlier.
