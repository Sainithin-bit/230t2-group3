 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - New Century Financial Corp. ( NEWC.PK ) unsecured creditors are opposing a government request to appoint a trustee to replace management, saying it would disrupt the subprime lender's liquidation. 

 In a filing late on Wednesday with the U.S. bankruptcy court in Wilmington, Delaware, a committee representing the creditors said naming a trustee would also disrupt its own plans to investigate and oversee the company's affairs. Irvine, California-based New Century filed for Chapter 11 protection on April 2. The creditors said they expect sales of major assets to be completed by mid-June. "Appointment of a trustee at this critical and early stage of the cases may cause disruption to the ongoing orderly liquidation of assets," wrote Bonnie Glantz Fatell, a lawyer for the committee. U.S. Trustee Kelly Beaudin Stapleton had argued in an April 17 court filing that management's failure "to ensure accurate financial accounting and to institute adequate internal controls" mandated the appointment of a trustee. She asked, alternatively, for the appointment of an examiner, who would have fewer powers but would be able to investigate alleged debtor misconduct. New Century on Tuesday opposed naming a trustee, saying its own executives were trying to sell assets quickly. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Kevin Carey has set a May 15 hearing on the matter. The creditors' committee has seven members, including affiliates of Credit Suisse Group ( CSGN.VX ), Deutsche Bank AG( DBKGn.DE ) and Wells Fargo & Co. ( WFC.N ). A separate Deutsche Bank affiliate that bought some New Century loans, DB Structured Products Inc., favors naming a trustee, saying a trustee could liquidate assets as well as or better than current management. A Deutsche Bank spokeswoman did not have an immediate comment. New Century was one of the largest U.S. providers of home loans to people with poor credit before collapsing amid a credit crunch, and after it had stopped making home loans. The company has fired some 5,200 employees since April 2 and has only about 1,000 employees left. It has failed to find a buyer for its lending unit. A hedge fund offered $133 million for its loan servicing unit, which handles collections, pending the receipt of higher bids. New Century shares were down 8 cents to 45 cents in late morning trading on the Pink Sheets.
