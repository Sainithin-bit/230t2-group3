 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Conrad Black's chief lawyer riddled the star witness against the former media baron with questions on Thursday about past lies he admitted to, suggesting that since he lied then the jury can't trust him to tell the truth now. 

 Edward Greenspan peppered David Radler, Black's lieutenant for 30 years who has already pleaded guilty to fraud, with questions about a meeting in 2003 with lawyers from a special committee. The group was looking into irregularities at the company that ran Black's media empire, Hollinger International Inc. "You lied to the lawyers from the special committee?" Greenspan asked. "I was not forthcoming to the lawyers from the special committee," Radler replied. "Tell me, Mr. Radler, at what point prior to this interview did you decide that you would lie, or not be forthcoming, as you put it?" Greenspan asked. "I just went to the interview," Radler responded, leading to a tense exchange with Black's lawyer after which Radler blurted out in a raised voice: "Sir, there were some questions to which I gave answers that were not totally truthful, i.e., I lied." "Did you stutter when you lied?" Greenspan asked. "Sir, I said I lied," Radler responded. "Was there a pause when you lied?" Greenspan went on. "Sir, I told lies," Radler replied. "When you lie, do you look a certain way?" Greenspan asked. "That's for others to determine. I can't view myself," Radler replied. "So you might be lying now?" Greenspan suggested. "False. I am not lying," Radler replied. RIGHT HAND MAN? Later, before the trial recessed Thursday afternoon until Monday, Greenspan attempted to separate Radler from Black, part of a continuing defense strategy to try to show the two men did not operate in lock-step. "The fact is you made a lot of decisions on your own, didn't you? In fact, you're not Conrad's right-hand man," Greenspan told Radler. "I don't know what that means. I reported to Conrad about every transaction," Radler replied. Greenspan then asked Radler about a Toronto Star story from August 31, 1996, in which he said Radler was quoted as saying: "I am nobody's right-hand man." "I don't remember telling anybody that," Radler said." Radler, testifying for a fourth day in the ninth week of the fraud trial against Black and three co-defendants, has been seen as the linchpin of the government's case. The Canadian-born Black, 62, a member of Britain's House of Lords, is accused along with the three others of stealing $60 million from Hollinger International by using so-called non-compete payments from the sale of media properties as tax-free bonuses for themselves instead of revenue for the company and its shareholders. The payments came at a time when Black and Radler were selling off hundreds of newspapers and other holdings from what had become one of the world's largest media companies. Such non-compete payments were designed to give the buyer a guarantee that the seller, in this case Black's company, would not reenter the same media market. On Thursday morning, in response to further questioning, Radler said he had lied to the Hollinger special committee "because of the personal consequences, and because of my associates and the consequences to them." "At no point in this interview did you tell the special committee that these non-compete payments ... were wrong?" Greenspan asked. "If they didn't ask the question, I didn't say anything," Radler replied. "You lied to save yourself. Correct?" Greenspan asked. "Myself and others," Radler replied. "Aren't you doing the same thing here, lying to save yourself?" Greenspan said. "No," Radler replied. Radler has been sentenced to 29 months in prison under a plea agreement reached two years ago in the case after admitting to a single count of fraud. If convicted, Black faces up to 101 years in prison, millions in fines and $92 million in forfeitures. The case is being prosecuted by the office of U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald, who recently won a perjury conviction against former top White House aide Lewis "Scooter" Libby.
