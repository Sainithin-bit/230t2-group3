 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A U.S. judge has declared a mistrial on the remaining conspiracy charge in the trial of former brokers and day trading executives charged with the improper use of information broadcast over brokers' internal " squawk box" systems. 

 The jury earlier returned a partial verdict in the case. Prosecutors accused former stock brokers at Merrill Lynch and Co. Inc., Citigroup and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. of taking bribes in exchange for allowing day traders at the now-defunct broker-dealer A.B. Watley Inc. to listen to their firms' squawk boxes through open telephone lines.
