 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit widened more than expected in March to $63.9 billion, as higher oil prices helped push total imports to the second highest on record, a U.S. government report showed on Thursday. 

 The trade gap swelled 10.4 percent from February, the Commerce Department said, surprising Wall Street economists who had expected a more modest expansion. The midpoint estimate of analysts surveyed before the report pegged the March trade gap at $60 billion. Overall U.S. imports increased 4.5 percent in March to $190.1 billion, led by a gain of more than 11 percent in imports of industrial supplies and materials to $49 billion. The volume of March crude oil imports rose to their highest level since August 2006, while the average price for imported oil rose to $53.00 per barrel from $50.71 in February. Record imports of consumer goods and food, feed and beverages also helped push the overall tally higher. However, U.S. exports had another strong showing, rising 1.8 percent in March to $126.2 billion, second only to the record set in January. U.S. exports to Canada, the European Union -- and individually to Germany -- and China set records, while shipments to Japan were the highest since March 2001. The United States also exported record amounts of advanced technology products such as computer, telecommunications, aerospace and electronic equipment. The closely watched U.S. trade deficit with China shrank 6.4 percent to $17.2 billion, as imports from that country were the lowest since May 2006. Despite widening dramatically in March, the trade gap for the first quarter of the year totaled $180.7 billion, smaller than $191.6 billion in the same period last year when the annual deficit hit a record $765.3 billion.
