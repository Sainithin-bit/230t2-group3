 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - EchoStar Communications Corp. ( DISH.O ) on Thursday said its quarterly profit rose almost 7 percent fueled by subscriber growth at its Dish Network satellite television service. 

 The No. 2 U.S. satellite TV provider behind DirecTV Group Inc. DTV.N said first-quarter net income rose to $157 million, or 35 cents per share, from $147 million, or 33 cents per share, a year ago. Revenue for the quarter rose to $2.64 billion from $2.30 billion. Analysts expected a profit of 44 cents a share on revenue of $2.64 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. The company said it added 310,000 net new subscribers, and ended the period with a total of 13.4 million, up from about 12.3 million a year earlier. The company attributed subscriber gains to increased advertising and customers' attraction to its high-definition and seasonal programming. Shares of EchoStar closed on Wednesday at $48.17 on Nasdaq, up about 26 percent so far this year.
