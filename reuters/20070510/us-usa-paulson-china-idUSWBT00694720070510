 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said a low-valued Chinese yuan was not the primary reason that the United States was running record trade deficits with China. 

 In an interview aired on Thursday with CNBC television, Paulson said high Chinese precautionary savings rates and reluctance to spend were the key reason for deficits. "The biggest factor in the trade deficit is...savings rates of 50 percent and (the fact that) most of their growth is driven by exports and there's not a big enough domestic consumption portion to their growth," Paulson said.
