 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Federated Department Stores Inc. FD.N, parent of Macy's and Bloomingdale's, on Thursday reported a 2.2 percent fall in April same-store sales, compared with an expected rise, saying a promotion did not produce expected results. 

 Cincinnati, Ohio-based Federated said total sales were $1.84 billion for the four weeks ended May 5, down 2.1 percent from the year-ago period. Federated had forecast April same-store sales would rise 2.5 percent to 4 percent. On Thursday it said May same-store sales were expected to be flat to down 2 percent.
