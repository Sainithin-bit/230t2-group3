 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - In a partial verdict, a U.S. jury on Thursday found former brokers and day-trading executives not guilty on most of the counts they faced in a trial over improper use of information broadcast over brokers' internal "squawk box" communications systems. 

 The jury said it was unable to come to a consensus on the first count of the indictment, a conspiracy charge. Judge I. Leo Glasser, who is hearing the case at U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, instructed the jury to continue deliberating on the conspiracy charge. Prosecutors accused former stock brokers at Merrill Lynch and Co. Inc., Citigroup and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. of taking bribes in exchange for allowing day traders at the now-defunct broker-dealer A.B. Watley Inc. to listen to their firms' squawk boxes through open telephone lines. The defendants denied wrongdoing. The jury said on Wednesday it was "deadlocked" on many of the same issues in the trial and Glasser said he would allow the panel of six men and six women to return a partial verdict. The only guilty verdict the jury returned in its fifth day of deliberations was against Timothy O'Connell, a former Merrill broker, who had been accused of participating in the scheme and telling his assistant to lie to government investigators about it. The jury said O'Connell was found guilty on one count of witness tampering and one count of making false statements. The remaining six defendants were found not guilty on all the charges in which the jury reached a consensus. O'Connell was also found not guilty on all the other charges he faced, excluding the conspiracy charge. Prosecutors had accused Watley day traders of generating at least $650,000 from 2002 to 2004 in illegal trading profits by buying or selling ahead of the large orders they heard about on the boxes -- an illegal practice known as "front-running." But during the seven-week trial, defense attorneys argued that the defendants were tricked into participating in the scheme by Watley's one-time chief executive, John Amore, and that the brokers had little or no training in how to use the squawk boxes. "The government pressed the envelope and they did the best they could and the jury did the right thing," said Roland Riopelle, a lawyer representing former A.B. Watley President Robert Malin. Prosecutors would not comment. The broker defendants include Kenneth Mahaffy, a former broker at Merrill and Citigroup's Smith Barney unit; O'Connell, who worked with Mahaffy at a Merrill branch; and David Ghysels, who worked at a Lehman Brothers office in Florida. The Watley defendants include Malin; Linus Nwaigwe, the firm's compliance director; its former chief operating officer, Michael Picone; and Keevin Leonard, who supervised Watley's traders. Each defendant faces a maximum of 25 years in jail and fines of $250,000 on each of the conspiracy charges. Several defendants also face a civil lawsuit brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
