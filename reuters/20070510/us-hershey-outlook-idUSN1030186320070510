 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Chocolate maker Hershey Co. ( HSY.N ) on Thursday lowered its 2007 earnings forecast as higher dairy costs put additional pressure on a company that is spending more money on marketing and on new products such as dark chocolate bars. 

 The stock fell more than 4 percent on the warning. Hershey, which has lost U.S. market share to Mars Inc., has also been overhauling its supply chain and manufacturing system to try to improve margins. "While we've experienced some areas of improvement in the U.S. business, we're not as far along as we need to be," Richard Lenny, chief executive officer, said in a news release. "In addition, within the past few weeks, the impact of higher dairy costs has significantly increased our cost profile for the remainder of the year." On April 20, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced a 6 cents to 9 cents-per-pound increase in dry milk prices after discovering one processor submitted incorrect figures in a survey used to calculate weekly market prices. Some analysts are concerned that Hershey's issues could linger and point to the stocks valuation. Prior to Thursday, Hershey traded at almost 20 times estimated 2008 earnings, one of the highest valuations for U.S. food companies. "We see downside to (long-term) top-line guidance of 3 percent to 4 percent ... and are concerned that aggressive pricing ... trade spending and higher brand support will end up absorbing the bulk of the targeted cost savings," Pablo Zuanic, analyst at J.P. Morgan Securities, said in a research note. Zuanic rates the stock "underweight." Analysts also question how successful the company's attempts to take advantage of the boom in premium dark chocolate will be. "In our view, Hershey is the 'Anheuser-Busch of chocolate' and when consumers trade up to premium items it is to Heineken-like items such as Godiva, Lindt, Ghirardelli or even Dove," John McMillin, an analyst at Prudential Equity Group, said. He also rates the stock "underweight." Hershey said it now expects 4 percent to 6 percent growth in earnings from operations in 2007, compared with a prior forecast of 7 percent to 9 percent earnings growth. On a per-share basis, the company expects 2007 earnings from continuing operations of $2.46 to $2.51, on net sales growth of 3 percent to 4 percent. Analysts on average have forecast 2007 earnings of $2.54 on revenue of $5.10 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Hershey said earnings from operations are expected to be 34 cents to 35 cents in the second quarter. Wall Street expects the company to earn 43 cents a share. In 2007, the company expects to record charges of about $270 million to $300 million, or 75 cents to 84 cents a share. Hershey said its long-term expectations of net sales growth of 3 percent to 4 percent and earnings growth from continuing operations of 9 percent to 11 percent, remain unchanged. Hershey shares were down $1.77, or 3.2 percent, at $53.22 in early New York Stock Exchange trading. (Additional reporting by Swagata Gupta in Bangalore and  Euan Rocha  in New York)
