 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Gap Inc. ( GPS.N ) said on Thursday that sales at stores open at least a year fell 16 percent in April, hurt by larger declines at its Gap, Banana Republic and Old Navy stores in North America. 

 The retailer, which is searching for a new chief executive, has been trying to correct a long spate of negative same-store sales, a key gauge of retail performance. Analysts had been expecting same-store sales to fall between 14 percent and 5 percent, with an average view of a decline of 7.4 percent, according to a Reuters survey. Total net sales for the four weeks ended May 5 fell 11 percent to $1.09 billion, the San Francisco-based company said.
