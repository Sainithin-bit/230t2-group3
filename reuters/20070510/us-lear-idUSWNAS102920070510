 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Lear Corp. ( LEA.N ) said on Thursday a Michigan judge has dismissed three shareholder lawsuits challenging its proposed takeover by a business controlled by billionaire investor Carl Icahn and still plans a shareholder vote on June 27 at its annual meeting. 

 The judge determined that a prior lawsuit filed in Delaware takes precedence over the Michigan cases challenging Lear's purchase by American Real Estate Partners LP ( ACP.N ), it said. A preliminary injunction hearing on a consolidated Delaware case is scheduled for June 6.
