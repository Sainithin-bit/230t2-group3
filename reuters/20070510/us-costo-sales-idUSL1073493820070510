 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Costco Wholesale Corp. ( COST.O ) on Thursday reported a 7 percent rise in April sales at stores open for at least a year, helped by a calendar shift that resulted in an extra day of sales over the four-week period. 

 Analysts had on average been expecting the company to post a same-store sales increase of 6 percent, according to a Reuters survey. Costco, the largest U.S. warehouse club, said net sales for the four weeks ended May 6 rose 12 percent to $4.94 billion. The company said U.S. comparable sales for April increased 6 percent, while international sales were up 10 percent. This year's four-week period included 28 days of sales compared with 27 days last year, reflecting the timing of Easter, Costco said. The calendar shift helped boost this year's April sales by about 2 percent, the company said. Costco also said it plans to release its fiscal third quarter operating results on May 31.
