 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - News Corp.'s NWSa.N Rupert Murdoch expressed an interest in buying Dow Jones & Co. DJ.N more than a week earlier than previously reported, the Wall Street Journal reported on its Web site on Thursday. 

 Murdoch met Dow Jones Chief Executive Richard Zannino on March 29 and not the week of April 9 as previously reported, the paper said, citing unnamed sources. Murdoch expressed an interest in buying Dow Jones at the meeting with Zannino but did not make an offer or mention a price, the paper reported. News Corp. made its formal offer on April 17, the paper said. The $5 billion takeover bid was first reported publicly on May 1. News Corp. and Dow Jones could not immediately be reached for comment. The report comes as U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York state attorney general investigate unusual trading in Dow Jones' stock and options before the buyout offer was publicly announced on May 1.
