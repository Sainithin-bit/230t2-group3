 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Media conglomerate Viacom Inc. VIAb.N said on Thursday first-quarter profit fell 36 percent, dragged by restructuring charges and higher expenses at its MTV Networks. 

 Excluding restructuring charges, Viacom's quarterly profit of 34 cents beat Wall Street expectations of a profit of 31 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. The company controlled by media mogul Sumner Redstone said first-quarter profit fell to $203 million, or 29 cents per share, from $317.2 million, or 43 cents per share a year earlier. Revenue rose 16 percent to $2.75 billion, exceeding Wall Street estimates of $2.55 billion. Revenue at its cable networks, which include MTV, Nickelodeon and VH1 channels, rose 10 percent on higher affiliate revenue, but operating income fell 3 percent on increased expenses including higher programming amortization and selling and marketing expenses. Sales at movies studio Paramount rose 27 percent, but it logged an operating loss on higher print and advertising costs.
