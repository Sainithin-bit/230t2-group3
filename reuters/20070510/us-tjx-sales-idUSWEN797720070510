 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - TJX Cos. Inc. ( TJX.N ) said sales at stores open at least a full year fell 1 percent in April due to cold and wet weather across most regions of the country. 

 Framingham, Massachusetts-based TJX, which operates the T.J. Maxx and Marshalls chains, said its total sales for the four weeks ended May 5 rose 2 percent to $1.3 billion. Analysts, on average, had been expecting same-store sales to range between a decline of 4 percent, to a rise of 4 percent, with an average view of flat sales at established stores, according to a Reuters survey.
