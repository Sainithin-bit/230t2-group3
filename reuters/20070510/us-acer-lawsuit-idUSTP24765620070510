 TAIPEI  (Reuters) - Taiwan's Acer Inc. ( 2353.TW ) blamed on Thursday three of its PC contract manufacturing partners for a patent infringement lawsuit filed in the United States by rival Hewlett-Packard Co. ( HPQ.N ). 

 Acer, the world's No. 3 computer vendor, has filed a lawsuit against its Taiwan ODM (original design manufacturer) partners, Quanta Computer Inc. ( 2382.TW ), Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. ( 2317.TW ) and Wistron Corp. ( 3231.TW ). All of the three companies also produce computers for HP. As an ODM partner of Acer, the firms are not allowed to make products for HP using Acer's patents and vice versa, an Acer spokeswoman said. Acer competes with PC brands like HP, Dell Inc. DELL.O and China's Lenovo ( 0992.HK ) in the global PC market, where profit margins are thin and competition is stiff. Shares in the three contract manufacturers were little moved by the news. Quanta rose 0.1 percent by 0456 GMT, while Hon Hai and Wistron shed 0.4 percent, lagging the benchmark TAIEX  .TWII  index, which rose 0.4 percent. Acer shares also fell 0.5 percent. "This is not an attack on them, we are just requesting them to fulfill what they need to do and to take some responsibility for the lawsuit," the Acer spokeswoman said. Quanta said it would cooperate accordingly with Acer on the case. "We hope for an amicable resolution to the lawsuit," said a Quanta spokeswoman. Hon Hai and Wistron could not be immediately reached for comment. HP filed a patent infringement lawsuit to Acer in a Texas federal court in March, which seeks to stop the Taiwan firm from selling notebook computers and media centre related products in the United States. (Click <ID:nN27231990> for details) There were five patents listed in the lawsuit which were issued between 1997 and 2003. The patents were related to optical data storage, circuits and methods for reducing computer system power consumption, multiple processors in computer systems, and an improved method for attaching devices to a digital serial bus, which allows communication between electronic systems.
