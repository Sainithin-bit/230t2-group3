 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - The family at the center of an insider trading case involving shares of publisher Dow Jones & Co. Inc. DJ.N was rich, but not famous -- until this week. 

 A husband and wife -- Kan King Wong and Charlotte Ka On Wong Leung -- were accused by U.S. regulators on Tuesday of "widespread and unlawful trading activity" in Dow Jones shares ahead of News Corp.'s NWSa.N $5 billion takeover bid that resulted in a potential gain of $8.1 million. To help finance the trading, $3.1 million was transferred from the wife's father, businessman Michael Leung Kai Hung, into an account held by the couple at Merrill Lynch MER.N, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's complaint said. Michael Leung, who was not named as a defendant in the civil complaint filed by the SEC, is the founder of a garment manufacturer and started a Hong Kong mobile phone company that was sold last year to giant China Mobile ( 0941.HK ). Leung declined to comment Wednesday. "I will not comment for now because the case is being handled by lawyers," he told a local radio station. His daughter and her husband could not be reached for comment on Wednesday, and reporters visiting the couple's luxury apartment building in Hong Kong's Mid-Levels neighborhood were asked by security guards to leave. FAMILY MATTERS Like many Hong Kong businessmen of his generation, Leung built his fortune himself. And as is often the case in Asia, he conducted business with family members. The cellphone company that Leung founded employed his daughter Charlotte Wong as a vice president until she left in March. Her husband is a consultant to the firm, according to Josephine Tong, a spokeswoman for China Mobile Peoples Telephone. Leung's age is given as 64 in the 2006 annual report of Raymond Industrial Ltd., a Hong Kong manufacturer on whose board he serves. Leung holds a degree in social work and spent more than a year as a probation officer before starting a garment business, according to a biography written when he was awarded an honorary fellowship at Lingnan University. He branched out into the telecoms business in the mid-1980s, and continues to run his Onwel Group of companies, where he is executive chairman, and serves on boards of educational and other organizations. As of May 2005, Leung owned about 18 percent of China Resources Peoples Telephone Co. Ltd., which China Mobile agreed to buy in October 2005 in a deal that valued the small Hong Kong carrier at about $434 million and would have made Leung's stake worth $78 million. Leung, who sold all his shares when China Mobile took over the firm, resigned his post as executive vice chairman of what is now known as China Mobile Peoples Telephone at the end of January 2007, the company spokeswoman said. INSIDER KNOWLEDGE The SEC complaint does not say how the couple may have come into possession of any inside knowledge. A source familiar with the situation said the irregular trading pattern was spotted by Merrill Lynch and reported to the SEC. In court documents, the SEC said it had "strong circumstantial evidence" that improper trading had occurred, saying the Dow Jones stock purchases had increased the value of the defendants' Merrill Lynch portfolio by about 25 times. The couple had no history of trading Dow Jones stock in the account previously, the SEC said. The Wall Street Journal, which is owned by Dow Jones, reported on Wednesday that one possible connection the SEC was expected to pursue involved Dow Jones director David Li, chairman and chief executive of the Bank of East Asia Ltd. ( 0023.HK ) in Hong Kong. Li and Leung share a history of business and social dealings, the newspaper reported. Li's office declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. A Dow Jones spokesman also had no comment. Li was quoted in the Journal as saying, "I did not disclose to anyone, not even my wife, any information about Dow Jones." The Journal reported that Li said he did not recall exactly when he learned about the takeover offer but believed it was during a telephonic board meeting prior to the Dow Jones annual meeting on April 18. "I cannot remember when it was because there were so many conversations," he told the newspaper. In its complaint against the Hong Kong couple, the SEC said the pair spent more than a week transferring in millions of dollars from Michael Leung, a bank in Brussels and two margin loans to their brokerage account to buy the shares in the two weeks before the bid was publicly announced. Shares of Dow Jones closed at $36.33 the day before the $60-a-share takeover offer for the company became public. After the bid was announced on May 1, the stock jumped above $55.
