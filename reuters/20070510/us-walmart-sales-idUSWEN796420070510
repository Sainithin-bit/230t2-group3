 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) on Thursday reported a 3.5 percent drop in sales at U.S. stores open at least a year in April, the largest decline since the world's largest retailer began reporting same-store sales results in 1979. 

 The weak report comes as Wal-Mart prepares to report its first-quarter earnings figures on May 15. Last month, Wal-Mart said that meeting its first-quarter earnings forecast of 68 cents to 71 cents per share from continuing operations would be a challenge, given the tough sales outlook for April. It did not update the earnings forecast on Thursday. Analysts, on average, are expecting it to earn 68 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Its shares declined 7 cents to $47.86 in afternoon New York Stock Exchange trading. DISAPPOINTING APRIL Retailers reported largely disappointing sales figures on Thursday, hurt by cold weather and a shift in the Easter holiday to April 8 this year from April 16 last year, which pulled sales into March. Wal-Mart rival Target Corp. ( TGT.N ) said its April sales at stores open at least a year fell 6.1 percent, hurt by a sales shortfall in the first two weeks of the month. But Wal-Mart's weak report follows a string of anemic U.S. same-store sales gains as the retailer has struggled with merchandising missteps and store remodeling projects it says have disrupted shoppers. After downplaying its discount roots last year, the retailer is now reemphasizing its low prices. "It's not surprising that their results were as weak as they were," said Joseph Beaulieu, an analyst with Morningstar, of the April sales figure. "Anyone who's currently invested in Wal-Mart is well aware of the problems the company faces." Wal-Mart said April same-store sales fell 4.6 percent at its Wal-Mart stores, while they rose 2.5 percent at Sam's Club. Sales in the apparel and home categories at Wal-Mart stores were soft as cold weather hurt store traffic and sales of seasonal merchandise, it said. Its grocery business performed better than general merchandise. Overall, its U.S. same-store sales fell 3.5 percent, while analysts had been expecting it to post an April same-store sales decrease of 1.2 percent, according to a Reuters survey. For April, Wal-Mart had forecast U.S. same-store sales would be flat to down 2 percent. The retailer said net sales in the month rose 3.7 percent to $26.57 billion. For May, it expects U.S. same-store sales to be up 1 percent to 2 percent and it forecast second-quarter same-store sales would rise 1 percent to 2 percent. Wal-Mart began reporting same-store sales results for its fiscal year beginning in February of 1979 and ending in January of 1980.
