 GENEVA  (Reuters) - The United States remains the world's most competitive economy but China is gaining ground, the Swiss-based International Institute for Management Development (IMD) said on Thursday. 

 Singapore and Hong Kong were second and third in the index of 55 countries behind the U.S. economy in the IMD's annual rating that measures countries' economic performance, government efficiency, business efficiency and infrastructure. China moved up three spots to 15th. Other big gainers in 2007 included Germany, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Sweden, while South Africa, Japan, Finland and Australia lost ground. France and Italy moved up a few places, to 28th and 42nd place, but remain well behind the top league, according to the IMD, which uses statistics and survey data to compile its World Competitiveness Yearbook. IMD Professor Stephane Garelli said the emergence of Russia, India and others as business contenders, with their companies buying industrial assets across the world, was likely to cause unease among European and North American powers. "They will not accept the loss of some of their 'business jewels' to newcomers without a fight," he said. "We shall thus face a year of rising protectionist measures. An increase in the number of complaints filed at the WTO for unfair practices can be expected."
