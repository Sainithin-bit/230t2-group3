 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Sara Lee Corp. SLE.N on Thursday posted higher quarterly profit as new products such as entree salads and whole grain white bread, as well as the weaker dollar, helped lift sales more than 9 percent. 

 The maker of Jimmy Dean sausage, Sara Lee baked goods and Kiwi shoe polish posted net income of $116 million, or 16 cents a share, for the fiscal third quarter ended March 31, compared with $42 million, or 6 cents, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, earnings matched the average analyst forecast of 13 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 9.2 percent to $3.01 billion. Excluding the impact of currency, acquisitions and divestitures, sales rose 4.9 percent. Sara Lee spun off its apparel business in September, the last major step in its sweeping portfolio overhaul. Sara Lee has cut jobs and closed some plants in order to reduce costs, while also spending more money on advertising and ramping up new product development to try to boost sales after undergoing its major restructuring over the past two years. For the full year, Sara Lee sees earnings from continuing operations of 63 cents to 69 cents a share, excluding most one-time items. That forecast is in line with the company's previous view. North American retail meat sales rose 6.2 percent, helped by Jimmy Dean breakfast sandwiches and skillet mixes and the introduction of Hillshire Farms entree salads. But profit in that segment fell to $31 million from $50 million a year earlier on higher labor and commodity costs and more spending to market and promote those products. North American retail baking segment sales rose 6.1 percent, helped by an acquisition and higher prices to offset rising wheat costs. The unit, which includes the Senseo coffee business, posted a loss of $12 million, compared with a loss of $6 million a year earlier. Food service sales rose 1.4 percent and profit in that unit jumped 42 percent, helped by higher prices and savings in procurement costs. International beverage sales rose 17.5 percent, though profit fell due to the sale of a business a year earlier. International bakery sales rose 11.4 percent and profit rose 2.2 percent, helped by the weaker U.S. dollar, which lifts the value of overseas sales. Household and body care sales rose 14.3 percent and profit jumped 48.1 percent. Sara Lee shares fell 1.4 percent, or 24 cents, to $16.86 in Thursday morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The company's stock trades at about 19 times estimated 2008 earnings.
