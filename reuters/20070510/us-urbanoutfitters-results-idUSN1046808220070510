 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Clothing and home furnishings retailer Urban Outfitters Inc. ( URBN.O ) posted a 45 percent rise in quarterly earnings, helped by a lower tax rate, more stores and improvements in its women's apparel business. 

 But earnings came in below analysts' expectations, when excluding a 3-cent-per-share benefit from a lower tax rate, and the company's stock fell as much as 5.6 percent. The operator of the Anthropologie, Free People and Urban Outfitters chains said on Thursday that it earned $29.4 million, or 17 cents per share, in the first quarter, up from $20.3 million, or 12 cents per share, a year earlier. Total sales rose 16 percent to $314.5 million. Wall Street, on average, had been expecting earnings of 17 cents per share, on revenue of $315.7 million, according to Reuters Estimates. The gross profit margin was relatively flat compared with the same quarter last year, the company said, while sales from six new stores helped boost results. "The reality is, they've been adding stores rapidly and so not only did they miss (earnings expectations), they should be growing earnings rapidly when you add stores," said Stifel Nicolaus analyst Richard Jaffe. Accelerated markdowns helped to drive sales, Jaffe said. The company made progress in its women's apparel business, which was the best performing category at Anthropologie stores, said Glen Senk, that chain's president who is expected to be named chief executive later this month. LAGGARD The women's apparel business struggled last year as consumers were slow to embrace new, fashionable silhouettes such as voluminous tops and slim jeans and pants. Overall, the company reported a 2 percent decline in same-store sales, a key measure of retail performance. Anthropologie, which sells clothing and items such as ceramics, candles and bath products, and Free People, a small chain that also sells to specialty shops on a wholesale basis, had same-store rises of 2 percent and 8 percent respectively. Urban Outfitters, a chain Jaffe described as the company's "laggard," reported a 5 percent drop in sales at stores open at least a year due to factors including unusually cool weather. But total same-store sales have been positive thus far in May, the company said on a conference call with analysts. Direct-to-consumer sales jumped 30 percent in the quarter to $43.5 million. The company, which plans to launch its fourth chain of stores early next year, said it was committed to annual revenue growth of more than 20 percent and to increase earnings at a faster rate than revenues. Shares of Urban Outfitters were down 1.9 percent, or 51 cents, at $25.78 in early afternoon trading. (Additional reporting by Mathew Veedon in Bangalore)
