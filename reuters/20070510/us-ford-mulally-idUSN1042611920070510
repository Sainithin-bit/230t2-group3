 WILMINGTON  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) Chief Executive Alan Mulally said on Thursday he expects further consolidation in the auto industry, driven by too much capacity. 

 "Clearly the world has an overcapacity in the automobile industry," Mulally told reporters on the sidelines of the automaker's annual shareholder meeting in Wilmington, Delaware. "I expect that we'll see consolidation over time, in the form of mergers or acquisitions or equity (stakes)," he said. Mulally also said the automaker may have cut production a bit too much last year as it tried to align production with demand. "Some people think we went a bit too far on that, so we've increased production a bit and are in constant talks with our dealers," he said. Mulally also said the automaker will consider reinstating a dividend to shareholders as the company progresses with its turnaround effort and tries to restore profitability. Ford lost $12.7 billion in 2006 and is in the middle of a restructuring that includes slashing more than 30,000 jobs and closing 16 facilities.
