 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Bausch & Lomb Inc. BOL.N said on Thursday it expects first-quarter profits to rise 63 percent from the year-earlier period. 

 The company expects net earnings of $19.2 million, or about 35 cents per share, compared with $11.8 million, or 21 cents, in the year ago period. Rochester, New York-based Bausch & Lomb said 2006 earnings were reduced by a total of $19.6 million, or 35 cents per share, related to its recall of ReNu with MoistureLoc solution in May. Consolidated net sales are seen at $578.9 million for the first quarter, up 6 percent from $546 million a year earlier. Bausch & Lomb said first-quarter actual dollar sales fell 2 percent in the Americas, grew 24 percent in Europe and fell 5 percent in Asia. Analysts, on average, had expected the company to post net earnings of 36 cents a share on revenue of $575.9 million, according to Reuters Estimates. The company's shares closed down 1.8 percent at $60.81 on the New York Stock Exchange and were unchanged in after-hours trading.
