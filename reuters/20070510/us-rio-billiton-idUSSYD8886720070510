 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Shares in Rio Tinto Ltd./Plc. ( RIO.AX ) ( RIO.L ) retreated as much as 4 percent on Thursday in the absence of a widely rumored $100 billion-plus bid by rival BHP Billiton ( BHP.AX ) ( BLT.L ). 

 Rio Tinto was down 2.7 percent to A$92.88 in afternoon trading after surging to a record high on Wednesday when the rumor sparked a dash for Rio stock. BHP dipped 0.25 percent to A$31.85. "I think it's normal market reaction. It was just one of those market rumors that can run hot and cold," said Greg Goodsell, equity strategist at ABN AMRO. Rio Tinto's Australian-listed shares reached an all-time high of A$99.69 on Wednesday -- almost becoming Australia's first A$100 share -- on rumors BHP would offer A$110 a share. Rio Tinto would only say it was not aware of any BHP approach. JP Morgan analyst David George has put an A$110 a share target on Rio Tinto, which hinges on robust commodities prices. Analysts said a marriage still made sense given synergies in iron ore, copper and uranium mining, but questioned the likelihood of BHP launching a hostile offer at this time given BHP's focus on internal growth. Based on the Sydney and London closing prices, the combined market value of BHP and Rio is about $250 billion, which would make it the world's fifth largest company behind Exxon, General Electric, Microsoft and Citigroup. TRICKY TAKEOVER "It's difficult to see BHP making a big strategic decision from an operational view given the stage of the market and the kind of expansion projects they've got on," Commonwealth Securities mining analyst Martin Petch said. BHP has earmarked $17.5 billon for 29 new projects either in development or in blueprint stages. Also, with British Rio Tinto Plc holding about 37.4 percent of the Australian-listed company's stock, a hostile takeover could be tricky, according to analysts. Rio Tinto's constitution requires a takeover be launched if more than 20 percent of the Australian company or 30 percent of the British company -- which trades at a modest discount as buybacks in Australia have taken stock out of the market -- or 20 percent of the entire group. "It could simply be large U.S. trading funds having fun with our market, picking on certain stocks to get our index higher," mining analyst John Colnan of Shaw Stockbroking in Sydney said. Trading in Rio stock on Wednesday drove Australia's S&P/ASX200 .AXJO index to a record high. A quick push to grow via a major acquisition to gain a tighter hold on the worldwide boom in commodities would be tempting to BHP, which by its own admittance is struggling to keep pace with demand. "This speculation highlights clearly to us the deep value in Rio Tinto and also the sector which has significantly de-rated over the past four years," Credit Suisse said in a report. "Whatever the outcome of this speculation, it is good news for both Rio Tinto and the sector." A union would assemble a force in iron ore mining -- each digs millions of tonnes of ore annually from neighboring lodes in Australia -- to rival the top producer, Brazil's CVRD. In copper mining, the enlarged company would approach Codelco of Chile, which mines around 1.3 million tonnes of copper in concentrate per year, although the combined entity would lag the Chilean producer in refined output. Desperate to cash in on near-record copper prices, BHP intends to restart its long-idled Pinto Valley copper mine in Arizona, a high-cost mine that was part of a disastrous acquisition of Magma Copper in the mid-1990s that almost left the company in financial ruin. "In this market, anyone that has something to mine is mining it," BNP Paribas analyst David Thurtell said. Trading in Rio Tinto stock on Thursday was in sharp contrast to Wednesday, when talk swept Australian, then London markets, that BHP was readying a run on its close rival, despite Rio Tinto issuing a statement denying there had been an approach. Moreover, BHP announced that it had repurchased 500,000 shares for cancellation on Wednesday, an unlikely exercise if it were readying a bid. However, Rio's share price is still up more than 11 percent on its close last Thursday, before speculation of a tie-up with BHP first emerged in a report by Citigroup. Volume was brisk with nearly 3 million shares changing hands in morning trade.
