 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bankrupt automaker Chrysler LLC idled its manufacturing plants on Friday, its lawyer Corinne Ball said during the company's first court hearing. 

 Chrysler filed for bankruptcy on Thursday in New York and disclosed a reorganization plan that will put Chrysler's core assets into a new company owned by its workers, Italian car maker Fiat SpA and the U.S. and Canadian governments. It also said on Thursday that it would idle plants for the 30 to 60 days it believes it will take to restructure. The company is aware that experts believe that a car company cannot survive bankruptcy, but Chrysler can, and must, Ball said. "We need to keep driving forward. We need to protect our core value and we need to keep safe our customers," Ball, who works for the law firm Jones Day, said. The case is in re Chrysler LLC, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York, No. 09-50002. (Reporting by  Emily Chasan  and Tom Hals, writing by Caroline Humer, editing by Dave Zimmerman)
