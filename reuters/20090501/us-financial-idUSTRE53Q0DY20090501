 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence soared in April but Japan slipped into deflation and Britain's efforts to pump cash into its financial system showed little success, signaling on Friday the global downturn is far from over. 

 Chrysler CBS.UL idled plants and said its survival hinges on quick approval by a bankruptcy court of a restructuring plan that has drawn strong opposition from some of the automaker's lenders. In more tough going for carmakers, U.S. auto sales fell to their lowest levels in nearly 30 years in April, led by a 48 percent slump for Chrysler. "The looming economic recovery is expected to be gradual as the credit markets are still going through a massive restructuring following the shocks of 2008," said Joseph Keating, chief investment officer at RBC Bank. With President Barack Obama's new administration trying to rescue the United States from recession and overhaul the financial system, signs of hope emerged in the U.S. economy. U.S. consumers felt more confident in April than at any time since the September failure of Lehman Brothers that pushed global banking to the brink of collapse, a Reuters/University of Michigan survey showed. It was the biggest one-month rise since October 2006 and also marked the first yearly increase since July 2007. The U.S. factory sector shrank in April, but at a slower pace, suggesting some stability for manufacturers and the broader economy. But in Turkey, where a recession is expected this year, Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan named a new economy tsar in a wide-ranging cabinet reshuffle. STRESS OVER 'STRESS TESTS' While encouraged by some of the numbers, most economists agree that a floor under the economy does not mean a swift rebound. "The funny part about this downturn is that if you didn't have the banking crisis, you would just say that this is a conventional, very severe recession and we are headed toward a sharp recovery," said Kurt Karl, head of economic research and consulting at Swiss Re in New York. "But with headwinds of the banking turmoil, it is unlikely that it will be really robust." On May 7, the anxiously awaited "stress test" results on the health of the largest 19 U.S. banks are expected to be made public, a government source said. "There's some apprehension about the stress tests next week and the fact that (the results) were pushed back, I think, is more of a negative sign," said Michael James, a senior trader at Wedbush Morgan in Los Angeles. The surprising consumer sentiment and manufacturing readings did sap some safe-haven demand, pushing U.S. government bond yields to five-month peaks. U.S. stock markets .N closed slightly higher as rising optimism that the worst of the recession may be over offset selling pressure from investors locking in gains from April. The rosier consumer mood in April and dollar weakness against the euro boosted U.S. crude oil by more than 3 percent to around $52.73 a barrel. NOT MUCH JOY IN JAPAN, UK Data from Japan and Britain was less encouraging. The Bank of Japan forecast two years of deflation and Japan's jobless rate jumped to a four-year high of 4.8 percent in March. "Deflation will be damaging to the economy. Companies will have difficulty increasing profits and their effective burden from borrowing money will increase," said Takeshi Minami, chief economist of Norinchukin Research Institute. But Japan's Nikkei stock index  .N225  closed at its highest level in almost four months, lifted by optimism that a weaker yen would boost exports. In Britain, data showed scant sign that households and businesses were seeing much benefit yet from quantitative easing -- the Bank of England's efforts to boost financial liquidity by buying securities in the market. The only bright spot in Britain's data was evidence that manufacturers were beginning to benefit from the weakness of the pound. With many markets closed for the May 1 holiday, London's FTSE 100 share index  .FTSE  ended flat after two days of sharp gains.
