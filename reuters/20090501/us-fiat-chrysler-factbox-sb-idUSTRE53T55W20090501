 (Reuters) - Troubled Chrysler LLC is set to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection -- a first for the Big Three U.S. carmakers -- after talks with bondholders to restructure its debt collapsed on Thursday. 

 Chrysler had been rushing toward a deadline to present a restructuring plan to the U.S. government by midnight before the talks broke down. The plan includes a partnership with Fiat SpA, the Italian automaker, which the bankruptcy filing does not preclude. Combined, the two would be the world's fifth-largest carmaker with 4.2 million unit sales a year, putting them on an equal footing with Korea's Hyundai Motor Co but behind Toyota Motor Corp, General Motors Corp, Volkswagen AG and Ford Motor Co. The following table shows the unit sales and market share of Fiat and Chrysler in Europe, the United States and the world in 2008 and March 2009.
