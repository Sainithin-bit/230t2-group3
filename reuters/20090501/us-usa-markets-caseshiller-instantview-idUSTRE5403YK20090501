 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. factory sector shrank further in April but at a slower pace, suggesting some stabilization in the battered sector and the broader economy, according to an industry report released on Friday. 

 U.S. consumers felt more confident about the economy last month than at any time since the September failure of Lehman Brothers that pushed global banking to the brink of collapse, a survey showed on Friday. KEY POINTS: ISM: * The Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity rose to 40.1 in April from 36.3 in March. * The median forecast among economists polled by Reuters was 38.0. * A reading below 50 indicates contraction in the manufacturing sector. * ISM said the index has been below this threshold for 15 straight months. UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN: * The Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers said its final index of confidence climbed to 65.1 in April from 57.3 in March. * That was the highest since September 2008 and the biggest one-month increase since October 2006. * The April reading also marked the first yearly increase since July 2007. * Economists polled by Reuters expected a slightly lower final reading of 61.9 for April. * The index of current economic conditions rose to 68.3 last month from 63.3 in March, the best reading in four months. * The index of consumer expectations climbed to 63.1 from 53.5, also the highest since September of 2008. COMMENTS: DAN GREENHAUS, ANALYST, MILLER TABAK & CO, NEW YORK: ISM: "The beat was led by a pickup in new orders, which spiked to 47. New orders are a large component. "The only thing I would note is that moderation in the pace of contraction is entirely to be expected. The question isn't whether we're stabilizing but how fast we're going to grow. This is one of the less worse figures, but that's becoming the general consensus. We have to move beyond moderating and stabilizing and onto when we're going to grow." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stocks turn positive after data. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices add to losses. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar holds gains versus yen.
