 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. economy faces a "very challenging" second quarter, with deeper deterioration of the housing market and higher unemployment, MasterCard Inc Chief Executive Robert Selander said on Friday. 

 The economy may start to stabilize in the second half, helped by the Obama administration's stimulus plans, but real improvement will not be seen until next year, he told Reuters in an interview. "We are planning for a very challenging second quarter, and we would expect to see improvements by the beginning of 2010," Selander said. MasterCard, the world's second-largest credit card network, posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings on Friday due to lower costs and increased fees. But it said revenue growth will fall short of its targets this year as the strong dollar hurts results overseas and debt-burdened consumers spend less. Selander said the strong dollar will keep weighing on revenue and net income for the rest of the year. He said MasterCard has cut about 130 jobs, or some 2 percent of its workforce.
