 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. officials will brief the 19 largest banks on Tuesday about the plan to publicly disclose the results of the government's stress tests, a source familiar with administration thinking said on Friday. 

 The source, speaking anonymously because the briefings will be private, said Federal Reserve and Treasury Department officials will tell the banks on May 5 how they plan to roll out the results on May 7. A government source said earlier on Friday that the government will provide stress test results on both an aggregate and individual holding company level.
