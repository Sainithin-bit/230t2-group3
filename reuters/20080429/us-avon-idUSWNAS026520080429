 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Avon Products Inc ( AVP.N ), the world's biggest direct seller of cosmetics, reported a higher quarterly profit on Tuesday, as strength in emerging and developing markets offset the impact of a weak economy and service problems in North America. 

 Net income was $184.7 million, or 43 cents per share, in the first quarter that ended on March 31, compared with $150 million, or 34 cents per share, in the year-earlier period. Results included $26 million, or 4 cents per share, in costs related to the company's restructuring. New York-based Avon has been trying to revive profits with a multiyear plan that includes weeding out less profitable items, overhauling its supply chain and cutting jobs. The company said it still anticipates annual savings of $430 million once the plan is fully implemented, expected in 2011 or 2012. Total revenue rose to $2.50 billion from $2.19 billion a year ago. Avon, whose products include makeup, perfume and anti-aging skin creams, affirmed its 2008 sales outlook, saying it is on track to have full-year sales rise at a mid single-digit percentage rate. Avon also said it expects its 2008 operating margin to "approach" 14 percent. (Reporting by  Martinne Geller , editing by Maureen Bavdek))
