 LONDON  (Reuters) - Militant attacks in Nigeria have forced Royal Dutch Shell Plc ( RDSa.L ) to shut in 164,000 barrels per day of output, the company's Chief Financial Officer Peter Voser said on Tuesday. 

 He was speaking at a press conference following first-quarter results that beat forecasts. (Reporting by  Alex Lawler ; editing by Peg Mackey)
