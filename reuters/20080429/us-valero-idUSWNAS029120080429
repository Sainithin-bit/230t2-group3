 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Valero Energy Corp ( VLO.N ), the largest U.S. oil refiner, said on Tuesday its first-quarter earnings tumbled 77 percent due to weak profits from gasoline production and unplanned outages at its refineries. 

 Companies that refine oil to produce gasoline and other fuels had a very difficult quarter as they struggled to pass through to their customers crude oil price increases of nearly 70 percent over the past year. Valero, whose shares were down 3 percent, said quarterly net income fell to $261 million, or 48 cents a share, from $1.14 billion, or $1.86 a share, a year earlier. Profit in the latest period included a pre-tax benefit of $101 million, or 12 cents per share, from a business interruption recovery related to a fire at the company's McKee refinery. Excluding that benefit, the company earned 36 cents a share. In late March, Valero said it expected earnings of 10 cents to 35 cents a share. After the warning, analysts' average forecast fell to 26 cents a share from 98 cents. Valero said benchmark margins on the U.S. Gulf Coast shrank by 59 percent from a year earlier as a jump in crude oil prices of $40 a barrel outpaced the rise in its selling price of gasoline. The sharp drop in gasoline profit was slightly offset by better profit margins for diesel and jet fuel, it said. Average throughput rates for its Gulf Coast plants should increase by about 100,000 barrels per day in the second quarter as repairs at its Port Arthur and Aruba refineries are likely to be completed in May. Natixis Bleichroeder analyst Roger Read, who has a "buy" rating on Valero shares, said, "Clearly, (the second quarter) has started off better than (the first quarter). But the big story for refining is that demand growth for refined products is pretty weak. "In that environment, we'll probably see a continuation of what we have seen, which is an average crack spread that is below the five-year average." "Crack spread" is an industry term for the difference between the price of oil and the prices of the refined products made from that oil. Valero said it was working closely with a prospective buyer for its Aruba refinery and would likely announce a deal during the second quarter. The company is evaluating bids it has received for its Memphis and Krotz Springs refineries and is now considering putting its Ardmore refinery on the market. Shares of Valero were down $1.78 to $51.15 in morning New York Stock Exchange trading. Through Monday's close, the shares had fallen 24 percent this year, compared with a decline of 29 percent in the S&P 1500 oil and gas refining and marketing sub-industry index .15GSPENRM.
