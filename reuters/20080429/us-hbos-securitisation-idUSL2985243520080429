 LONDON  (Reuters) - HBOS Plc HBOS.L, Britain's biggest mortgage lender, warned on Tuesday that the securitization market, an important funding source for consumer lending, is set to stay shut through 2008. 

 "We will keep asset growth restrained whilst securitization markets remain shut," Chief Executive Andy Hornby said on a conference call with analysts. "When securitization markets reopen, probably sometime in 2009, there will be good opportunities for wider margins but we will not be excessive." Securitization has been a key route for banks to offload exposure to consumer loans such as mortgages, credit card debt and auto loans, freeing up their balance sheets to make new loans. Banks bundle these assets together and then issue bonds backed by the cash flows from them. But the market shut down last summer as the credit crisis bit and losses on U.S. subprime-linked securities led investors to shun complex bonds of all types. Confidence was shattered as ratings agencies downgraded swathes of debt and the investor base for the deals was damaged as structured investment vehicles (SIVs), big buyers of asset-backed bonds, were forced into restructurings. Some had hoped that the market could pick up this year, but public issuance of asset-backed securities has slowed to a trickle. And while secondary market conditions have improved in recent weeks, along with other areas of the credit markets, there has been little sign of new bond sales. "Unlike other vanilla debt markets, the primary European securitization market has yet to respond to the recently improved market tone," analysts at Deutsche Bank led by Ganesh Rajendra wrote in a note to clients on Monday. "There has been very little publicly placed deal flow over recent months, with volumes overwhelmingly dominated by banks securitize-and-repo exercises," they wrote, referring to banks' ability to use ABS as collateral for borrowing from central banks. HBOS itself last week structured a 9 billion pound residential mortgage-backed deal that is being retained to boost funding flexibility. Analysts said the deal could potentially be used for the Bank of England's new liquidity scheme, although HBOS declined to comment. Deutsche Bank's analysts in fact argued that the BoE scheme risked diverting more structured finance volumes from the public markets in the near term. b(Reporting by  Clara Ferreira-Marques  and Richard Barley)
