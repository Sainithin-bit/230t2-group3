 LONDON  (Reuters) - Near record-high oil prices contain an element of speculation and there is sufficient supply in world markets, Royal Dutch Shell's ( RDSa.L ) Chief Financial Officer Peter Voser said on Tuesday. 

 Oil hit a record high of $119.93 on Monday as investors fretted over supply disruptions in Nigeria and Britain. "There is a lot of equity being switched into commodities, that is ... more the speculative element rather than actually the fundamentals," Voser said at a press conference following first-quarter results that beat forecasts. "We have enough product and enough crude." Producer countries have also blamed speculation for oil's rally and said there is no reason to increase output.
