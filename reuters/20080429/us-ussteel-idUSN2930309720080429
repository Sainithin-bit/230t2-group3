 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. Steel Corp ( X.N ) said on Tuesday that first-quarter profit dropped as income fell in two of the company's three segments -- European and tubular steel -- despite higher selling prices. 

 But the company said income from operations was expected to increase "substantially" in the second quarter, as price increases offset scrap and other raw material cost hikes. U.S. Steel stock fell more than 2 percent when the New York Stock Exchange opened, even though the results beat Wall Street estimates. "They were a little better than our estimates," said Mark Parr, an analyst with Keybanc Capital Markets, in Cleveland. "I have never seen a company use the word 'substantially,' so they clearly see a dramatic improvement in the second quarter. "Their domestic business was a little weaker, but it's normal to have delays when you have a big pickup in pricing. We should see the impact in the second quarter, the market is anticipating better numbers," Parr said. In its earnings release, U.S. Steel said net income was $235 million, or $1.98 per share, compared with $273 million, or $2.30 per share, in the same quarter a year earlier. Sales rose to $5.2 billion from $3.8 billion, the Pittsburgh-based steelmaker said. But income from operations in U.S. Steel's European business dropped to $161 million, from $206 million and in the tubular division, which manufactures pipes, it fell by half to $51 million from $102 million. Analysts on average were expecting earnings of $1.82 a share and revenue of $5.077 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. The company said two items, a $45 million pre-tax reserve for an adverse court ruling and a $17 million pre-tax charge for inventory transition related to the acquisition of U.S. Steel Canada, reduced net income by $45 million, or 38 cents per share. But a foreign currency gain increased net income by $70 million, or 59 cents per share, U.S. Steel said. In January, when U.S. Steel announced a sharp drop in fourth-quarter earnings, it said the first quarter would continue to reflect volatile costs and pricing. But on Tuesday, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John Surma said the second quarter will see improvement. "We expect that segment income from operations will increase substantially compared to the first quarter of 2008 as realized price increases are expected to surpass continuing increases in scrap and other raw materials costs." Second-quarter flat-rolled results are expected to improve significantly, he said, while U.S. Steel Europe expects second-quarter results to be higher on increased prices. "We expect second-quarter Tubular results to improve over the first quarter as higher prices and shipments are partially offset by further increases in costs, principally for semi-finished steel," he said. In morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the company's stock was down $3.44, or 2.25 percent, at $149.56. (Reporting by Steve James, editing by Dave Zimmerman)
