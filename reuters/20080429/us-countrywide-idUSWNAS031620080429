 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Countrywide Financial Corp CFC.N, the largest U.S. mortgage lender, posted a surprisingly large $893.1 million first-quarter loss on Tuesday, taking more than $3 billion of charges for write-downs and bad loans as the housing slump deepens. 

 The quarterly loss was the third straight for Countrywide, which agreed in January to be acquired by Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) for about $4 billion. Countrywide has lost more than $2.5 billion in the nine months ended March 31. Countrywide's loss equaled $1.60 per share, and compared with a profit of $434 million, or 72 cents, a year earlier. Analysts on average expected a loss of 12 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue for the Calabasas, California-based lender slid 72 percent to $678.9 million. Countrywide set aside $1.5 billion for bad loans, 10 times as much as a year earlier, and wrote down another $1.5 billion for other securities and claims. The company said about one in 11 borrowers overall and more than one in three subprime borrowers have fallen behind on home loan payments, both nearly twice as many as a year earlier. Countrywide collects payments on $1.48 trillion of home loans. Mortgage lending fell 36 percent to $73 billion. Fundings of adjustable-rate mortgages slid 70 percent to $12.2 billion, and subprime loan volume dropped to zero from $7.9 billion. BANK OF AMERICA COMMITS TO MERGER The results may be Countrywide's last as an independent company. Some investors have questioned whether Bank of America might reduce or back out of its offer to buy Countrywide, whose shares have long traded below the bank's offer price. Bob Stickler, a Bank of America spokesman, declined to discuss Countrywide's results, but said the merger remains on track to close in the third quarter. "Despite the big miss in the quarter, it's important to note that common equity per share still stands at $19.21, well above the deal price of around $7 per share," Lehman Brothers Inc analyst Bruce Harting wrote. "It would appear there is still considerable net asset value remaining to incentivize Bank of America to move forward with the deal." The combined company would make about one in four U.S. home loans. The Federal Reserve is holding public hearings on the merger. In morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, shares of Countrywide rose 7 cents to $5.90, and Bank of America fell 35 cents to $37.83. LATE PAYMENTS RISE Bank of America plans to install Countrywide Chief Operating Officer David Sambol to run its combined mortgage business, to be based in Calabasas, but not make many of the riskier home loans that caused problems for Countrywide. The bank also said it expects to modify or work out at least $40 billion of troubled mortgage loans over two years to keep at least 265,000 borrowers in their homes. It will also drop the Countrywide name. Countrywide said 9.27 percent of borrowers with home loans it services were behind on payments at the end of March, up from 8.64 percent at year end and 4.90 percent in March 2007. The subprime delinquency rate rose to 35.88 percent from 33.64 percent at year end and 19.62 percent last March. Countrywide also faces many investigations into its lending practices, lawsuits from shareholders and borrowers, and a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission probe into Chief Executive Angelo Mozilo's stock sales. Mozilo has denied wrongdoing. (Editing by Dave Zimmerman)
