 LONDON  (Reuters) - Militant attacks in Nigeria have forced Royal Dutch Shell Plc ( RDSa.L ) to shut in 164,000 barrels per day of output, the company's Chief Financial Officer Peter Voser said on Tuesday. 

 The figure was much less than that given by rebels from the oil-rich Niger Delta who said on Monday that a pipeline attack last week had closed down 350,000 bpd of Shell's production. Voser was speaking at a press conference following first-quarter results that beat forecasts. (Reporting by  Alex Lawler ; editing by Peg Mackey)
