 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - CBS Corp ( CBS.N ) and GE's ( GE.N ) NBC Universal plan to bid for the Weather Channel in the second round of bidding due in early to mid-May, two people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. 

 Privately held Landmark, which has put the channel up for sale along with other businesses, could see it sell for significantly less than the $5 billion it had originally sought, sources have told Reuters. (Reporting by  Jui Chakravorty ; editing by John Wallace)
