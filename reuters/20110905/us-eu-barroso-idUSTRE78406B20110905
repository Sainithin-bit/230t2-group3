 CANBERRA  (Reuters) - European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso on Monday said he still expected modest growth in Europe and did not anticipate a recession in Europe. 

 Barroso also said it was too early to asses whether Greece would meet its debt reduction commitments, but said the Greek government had said it would comply with its commitments. (Reporting by  James Grubel ; Editing by  Ed Davies )
