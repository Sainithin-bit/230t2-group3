 LONDON  (Reuters) - Brazilian miner Vale ( VALE5.SA ), formerly known as CVRD, has hired bankers to consider a bid for UK-listed rival Xstrata XTA.L possibly worth more than 38 billion pounds ($77 billion), UK newspapers said on Saturday. 

 Consolidation is sweeping the global mining industry, and Xstrata's shares jumped on Friday on speculation it could be a target. The Times newspaper, citing a source close to the process, said Vale's interest was at an early stage and no decision had been made about approaching the Xstrata board with a bid. The Financial Times said Vale had hired Lehman Brothers to look at a move. Anglo American ( AAL.L ) was cited as a possible predator for Xstrata on Friday but the Times said it was not contemplating an offer, citing a source close to the matter. A spokeswoman for Xstrata declined to comment. Vale could not immediately be reached. BHP Billiton ( BLT.L ) last month made a $120 billion takeover proposal for Rio Tinto ( RIO.L ), which has rejected the move. BHP wants to forge a mega-mining group with a market capitalization of around $350 billion and control of much of the world's iron ore, copper and aluminum.
