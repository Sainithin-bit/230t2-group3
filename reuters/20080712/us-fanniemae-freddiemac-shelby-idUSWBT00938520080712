 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Congress must move quickly to put a stronger regulator in place for government-sponsored entities Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, a senior aide to Republican Sen Richard Shelby said on Friday. 

 "The Senate and House should move immediately to pass and get to the President's desk the GSE reform pending before the Senate," Shelby spokesman Jonathan Graffeo said. "Senator Shelby has been and will remain in contact with the Administration regarding the GSEs' current situation." (Reporting by  Rachelle Younglai ; editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)
