 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Continental Airlines Inc CAL.N 
said on Friday it recorded an after-tax gain of $22 million in 
the second quarter reflecting a number of special items. 

  The company said it recorded a net gain of $78 million from 
the sale of its remaining interest in Copa Airlines, a special 
tax credit of $28 million, and another $3 million from the tax 
effects of special items.  It also recorded a $58 million pretax operating charge 
relating to write downs on aircraft swept up in capacity cuts 
planned for this fall, and a $29 million write down of student 
loan-related auction rate securities.  Continental anticipates it will record additional 
accounting charges in the third quarter of 2008 and beyond 
relating to future costs of capacity cuts.  The carrier was not able to estimate the amount and exact 
timing of future charges.  (Reporting by  John Crawley ; editing by Carol Bishopric)
