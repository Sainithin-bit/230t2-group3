 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Sen. Charles Schumer on Friday blamed IndyMac Bancorp Inc's failure on its main regulator, the Office of Thrift Supervision, and said it should start doing its job. 

 "If OTS had done its job as regulator and not let IndyMac's poor and loose lending practices continue, we wouldn't be where we are today," said Schumer, a Democrat from New York. "OTS should start doing its job to prevent future IndyMacs." The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp took control of IndyMac on Friday and will run the bank until it can find a buyer.
