 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Freddie Mac, the second-largest provider of funding for U.S. residential mortgages, on Friday denied it needs outside help to run the company since it has enough capital. 

 The company said a review of expected financial performance shows no immediate need to raise additional capital. It added that it has many options to raise capital, including cutting its common stock dividend. Media speculation that the company is on the threshold of conservatorship, in which regulators appoint a person or entity to run a troubled institution, "does not accurately reflect the facts," Freddie Mac said in an e-mailed statement.
