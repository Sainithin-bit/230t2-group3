 LONDON  (Reuters) - The euro tumbled to a 4-year low versus the dollar on Monday as fears escalate that planned belt-tightening measures would hit euro zone growth, fuelling concerns that the currency may face a further decline. 

 A 750 billion euro aid package from the European Union and the International Monetary fund announced the previous week had shored up confidence in bond markets, but failed to underpin the currency. Traders fear austerity measures announced by Greece, Spain and Portugal to tackle their huge financial deficits would hurt growth in the near term and force the European Central Bank to keep interest rates low in the medium term. The euro took out the October 2008 low around $1.2330 in Asia and fell as low as $1.2234, its lowest since April 2006. It has fallen more than 7 percent against the dollar this month, and is about 14 percent lower for the year, making it the worst-performing major currency this year.
