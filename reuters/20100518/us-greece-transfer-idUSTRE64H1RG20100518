 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Greece received 14.5 billion euros ($17.9 billion) in aid from the European Union on Tuesday, a Greek bank official close the deal said. 

 "The 14.5 billion euros was transferred to Greece a short while ago, through the ECB," said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. The loan, which came on top of 5.5 billion euros from the IMF last week, came just in time to pay an 8.5 billion euro bond which matures on Wednesday.
