 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc ( PFE.N ) on Tuesday said it plans to cut 6,000 manufacturing jobs, or 18 percent of that workforce, by late 2015, as the world's biggest drugmaker pares operations following its purchase of rival Wyeth. 

 Fourteen of its 78 plants are slated to cease or curtail operations; details are listed below. Pfizer plans to cease operations at the following eight plants: * Dublin, Ireland; and Carolina, Puerto Rico, which make sterile injectable drugs. * Caguas, Puerto Rico; Loughbeg, Ireland; and Rouses Point, New York, which make solid-dose drugs (tablets and capsules) * Biotech manufacturing in Shanbally, Ireland, and at a longtime Wyeth facility in Pearl River, New York. In Pearl River, Pfizer will also cease production of consumer healthcare products, but the site will remain a main center for vaccine research and development. * Richmond, Virginia, will cease production of consumer healthcare products, but continue to be the center for consumer healthcare product research and development. Pfizer plans to reduce operations at these six sites: * Illertissen, Germany; and Newbridge, Ireland, which make solid-dose drugs * Sanford, North Carolina; Andover, Massachusetts; and Havant, United Kingdom, which make biotech products. * Will phase out production of solid-dose drugs in Guayama, Puerto Rico, but expand consumer healthcare operations at the site.
