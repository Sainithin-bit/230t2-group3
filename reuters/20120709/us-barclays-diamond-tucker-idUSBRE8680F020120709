 LONDON  (Reuters) - Bank of England deputy governor Paul Tucker contacted Barclays ex-Chief Executive Bob Diamond several times in October 2008, newly released emails show, and on one occasion directly remarked on the high level of the price of a bond. 
 "Struck that your govt gnteed bond was issued at around 140 over gilts," the subject line of an email sent by Tucker to Diamond on October 26, 2008 said. "That's a lot," the body of the text said. Tucker is due to face a grilling by UK lawmakers later on Monday, in a probe in a rate-rigging scandal that has already cost Diamond his job at the bank.
