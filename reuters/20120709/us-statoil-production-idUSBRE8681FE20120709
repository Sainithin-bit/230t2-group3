 OSLO  (Reuters) - Norway's Statoil ( STL.OL ) plans the immediate restart all of its production on the Norwegian continental shelf, including output at its Oseberg field, after the government stopped a strike of offshore workers, the company said on Tuesday. 
 "It may take from 1 to 2 days to get production started and Statoil expects to have the fields back in full production within a week," the company said in a statement. The installations affected by the strike were Oseberg Field Centre, Oseberg South, Oseberg East, Oseberg C, Heidrun, Huldra, Veslefrikk and Brage. (Reporting by Nerijus Adomaitis)
