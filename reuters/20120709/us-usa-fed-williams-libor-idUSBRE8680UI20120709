 COEUR D'ALENE, Idaho (Reuters) - The revelation that Barclays appeared to have manipulated a key short-term borrowing rate has undermined confidence and trust in the entire banking system, a top Fed official said on Monday. 
 "Trust is absolutely critical to conduct any type of business," San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President John Williams said, answering an audience question after a speech to bankers here. (Reporting by  Ann Saphir ; Editing by  Chizu Nomiyama )
