 MADRID  (Reuters) - Spain will agree to create a single bad bank to house toxic assets from its banking sector, and all of the country's banks will raise core capital to 9 percent, as conditions for up to 100 billion euros in European aid, a government source said on Monday. 
 The source said Spain would sign a memorandum of understanding on Monday in Brussels regarding the rescue, which would be followed on July 20 by a loan agreement, which would possibly be on 15-year terms at 3 percent to 4 percent interest. (Reporting by  Fiona Ortiz ; Editing by Jesus Aguado)
