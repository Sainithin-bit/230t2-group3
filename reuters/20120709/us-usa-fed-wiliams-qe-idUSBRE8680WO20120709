 COEUR D'ALENE, Idaho (Reuters) - The U.S. economy is on the verge of needing another round of bond-buying to bring down high unemployment, a top Federal Reserve official said on Monday. 
 "We are right at that edge that if economic data keep coming in below our expectations ... then I think we would need more accommodation," San Francisco Fed President John Williams told reporters after a speech. (Reporting by Ann Saphir; Editing by  Padraic Cassidy )
