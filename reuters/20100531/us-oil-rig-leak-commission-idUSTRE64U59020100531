 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President Barack Obama will hold his first meeting Tuesday with the co-chairs of his new Gulf of Mexico oil spill commission, former Senator Bob Graham and former Environmental Protection Agency chief William Reilly, an administration official said. 

 Obama will sit down at the White House with the two men, who have been named to head a panel to investigate the disaster and make recommendations for the future of offshore drilling, and will then make a public statement, the official said.
