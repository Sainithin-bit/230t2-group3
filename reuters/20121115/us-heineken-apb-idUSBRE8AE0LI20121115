 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Dutch brewer Heineken ( HEIN.AS ) said on Thursday it had completed its purchase of Fraser and Neave's ( FRNM.SI ) direct and indirect stakes of Asia Pacific Breweries APBB.SI and would proceed to a complete buyout. 
 Heineken said it now owned 95.3 percent of Tiger beer maker APB and would consolidate it into its accounts this month. It also said it would make a mandatory general offer for the remaining APB shares. (Reporting By Philip Blenkinsop)
