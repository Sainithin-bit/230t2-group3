 BARCELONA  (Reuters) - Time Warner Cable ( TWC.N ), the second-largest U.S. cable provider, has made a good start to the fourth quarter in terms of net subscriber additions, its finance director said. 
 "We are a few weeks into the quarter and we are a little bit ahead of where we were last year," Irene Esteves told a Morgan Stanley investor conference on Thursday. "But I would caution that it is very early in the quarter and we are talking about very small numbers of net subscribers on a very large base." Esteves also noted that in the fourth quarter last year, the group enjoyed a strong increase in net additions in December. "So I would caution about extrapolating from a few weeks of data," she said of the firm, which is the second largest U.S. cable operator. (Reporting by  Kate Holton ; Editing by Dan Lalor)
