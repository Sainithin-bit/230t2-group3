 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Gold set record highs for a second straight day on Wednesday, while the dollar rebounded against major currencies as economic optimism sparked by Australia's interest-rate hike this week sputtered out. 

 An element of risk aversion crept back into markets as the dollar rose, crude oil fell and U.S. equity markets edged slightly higher on third-quarter earnings expectations. Government debt edged higher on both sides of the Atlantic. Oil prices slid under $70 a barrel after U.S. data showed fuel stocks surged last week in the United States, signaling a recovery in oil demand may take more time. Copper prices also slipped in thin and volatile trade during Chinese holidays, with rising inventories fueling uncertainty over demand against a still fragile economic backdrop. The Dow Jones industrial average fell while the two other major U.S. indexes rose slightly as investors booked profits after two days of strong gains and turned cautious at the approach of earnings season. "Across asset classes we're just seeing some giveback after yesterday's big moves," said Camilla Sutton, currency strategist at Scotia Capital in Toronto. The third-quarter earnings season kicked into gear after the bell when Alcoa Inc, whose results traditionally start a new quarter, reported a surprise profit after posting three consecutive quarters of losses. Expectations for the quarter have been high following the second quarter's strong showing, when more than 70 percent of companies beat Wall Street's consensus estimates. "I think expectations are much higher than the previous two quarters, where it was easier to beat," said Alan Lancz, president of Alan B. Lancz & Associates in Toledo, Ohio. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 5.67 points, or 0.06 percent, at 9,725.58. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was up 2.86 points, or 0.27 percent, at 1,057.58. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 6.76 points, or 0.32 percent, at 2,110.33. The dollar rebounded from a more than 8-month low against the yen after Japanese Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii said he was watching the currency market and that the exchange rate was driven by dollar weakness rather than yen strength. The dollar came under heavy pressure on Tuesday after a rate increase in Australia bolstered expectations the global economy was recovering and fueled a worldwide stock rally. Investors held their selling of the dollar after recently pushing it sharply lower. Sutton said while there is always concern that the U.S. currency is oversold, "trading activity tells us that so far any real bounce in the U.S. dollar has been used as a selling opportunity." The dollar rose against a basket of other major currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index up 0.14 percent at 76.443. The euro was down 0.26 percent at $1.4678 and against the yen, the dollar was down 0.19 percent at 88.59 yen. Spot gold hit a historic high of $1,048.20 an ounce, and was last at $1,043.00. Treasuries gained, with the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note up 22/32 in price to yield 3.18 percent. U.S. crude for November delivery settled 1.9 percent lower at $69.57 a barrel after gaining the two previous days. London Brent crude fell $1.36 to $67.20. The weekly report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm of the Department of Energy, showed crude stocks falling by 1 million barrels, against market expectations for a 2.2 million drop. "Crude is pivoting around $70 a barrel with factors on either side to hold it there. The key is going to be when demand figures for gasoline and distillate pick up," said Tradition Energy's Gene McGillian. European shares closed lower and U.S. equities fell as investors booked profits ahead of the start of the U.S. earnings season after the bell on Wednesday, when Alcoa reported third-quarter results. "We are just seeing a little bit of profit taking. There is no bad economic data out there," said David Buik, partner at BGC Partners. "We have Alcoa's results tonight and then the earnings show will be on the road. Alcoa Inc posted a surprise profit after the closing bell on Wall Street, easily beating analysts' forecasts, on cost savings and an increase in aluminum prices. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of top shares closed down 0.4 percent at 988.76. Earlier in Asia, shares rose for a second day on growing confidence in a strengthening global recovery boosted resource and financial companies. The MSCI index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 1.3 percent; the Thomson Reuters index of regional shares rose 1 percent. Japan's Nikkei average gained 1.1 percent.
