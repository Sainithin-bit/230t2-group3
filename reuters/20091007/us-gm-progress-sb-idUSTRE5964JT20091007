 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Co provided an update on its restructuring Wednesday, three months after emerging from a government-sponsored bankruptcy. 

 Details from GM's progress report follow: * To release third-quarter financial results in mid-November, preparing for initial public offering next year. * Business plan being developed on assumption that U.S. auto industry sales will reach 11.5 million vehicles in 2010. * Preliminary third-quarter global market share 11.9 percent, compared with 12.4 percent in 2008; U.S. market share 19.5 percent, compared with 22.1 percent in 2008. * Expects to have 41 U.S. plants at the end of 2009, down from 47 at the end of 2008; figures exclude plants reacquired from former parts unit Delphi. GM has acquired Delphi's global steering business and four other key plants. * Has 49,200 U.S. hourly workers as of Wednesday, down from 62,000 at the end of 2008 but higher than planned because buyout programs were not as well-subscribed as expected. * Has 24,300 U.S. salaried workers, down from 29,700 at the end of 2008; expects to have 23,000 to 24,000 salaried workers at the end of 2009. * Has 5,800 U.S. dealers, down from 6,375 at the end of 2008; plans to have 5,600 at the end of 2009. * Expects to complete the sale of its Saab and Hummer brands by the end of 2009; also working toward the sale of a controlling stake in its European Opel brand. GM will retain a 35 percent stake in Opel. (Reporting by  David Bailey ,  Kevin Krolicki  and  Soyoung Kim )
