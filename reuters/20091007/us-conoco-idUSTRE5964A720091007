 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - U.S. oil major ConocoPhillips said on Wednesday its capital budget would decrease by about 12 percent in 2010, and it plans to divest $10 billion in assets in a bid to improve its financial position. 

 Wall Street analysts have criticized Conoco for its heavy debt load and high cost structure. Conoco and others have also been hurt by steep declines in crude oil and natural gas prices from peaks reached in 2008. While crude prices have recovered to around $69 per barrel, the global recession is still hurting energy demand. "This plan capitalizes on our large resource base and our strong portfolio of projects, while providing flexibility for potential changes in business conditions. We will replace reserves and grow production from a reduced, but more strategic, asset base," Jim Mulva, chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. The company, based in Houston, said it expects to spend about $11 billion in 2010, down from $12.5 billion in 2009. Conoco said it would sell about $10 billion of its refining and exploration and production assets over the next two years, with proceeds targeted for debt reduction. The asset sales will help accelerate the company's plan to reach a debt-to-capital ratio of 20 percent to 25 percent, it said. At the end of June the company had long-term debt of $28.9 billion, up from $27.1 billion at the end of 2008, and its debt-to-capital ratio was 34 percent. Conoco also raised its quarterly dividend 6 percent, to 50 cents per share. Phil Adams, analyst at Gimme Credit LLC, said Conoco's plans were "very good news for bondholders," in a note to clients of the independent research firm. Oil and gas reserves will be replaced through growth rather than acquisitions; production growth will occur, but from a reduced asset base due to the planned divestitures, the company said. Shares of Conoco were up 95 cents or 2 percent at $49.36 on Wednesday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange. That compares with a slight decline in the CBOE index of oil companies.
