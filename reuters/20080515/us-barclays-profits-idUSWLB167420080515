 LONDON  (Reuters) - British bank Barclays said it was comfortable with forecasts predicting it will make a profit of about 6.4 billion pounds ($12.5 billion) this year, which would be down 10 percent from 2007. 

 Chris Lucas, finance director, told analysts on a conference call that he assessed whether internal estimates matched their forecasts. "You should take the fact we've not said anything as an indication you don't need a shove (in either direction)," he said. The consensus forecast on the bank's website, updated this week, is for a 2008 pretax profit of 6.36 billion pounds. Its profit was 7.08 billion in 2007. Lucas also said the bank expects British house prices to fall by between 5 percent and 10 percent over the next two years.
