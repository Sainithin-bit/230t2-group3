 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Stocks rose in light trading on Thursday, pushing the S&P 500 to its highest close since January, as a pullback in oil prices eased concerns about inflation and a battle to control Yahoo Inc ( YHOO.O ) helped the tech sector. 

 The Nasdaq also had its best close since January 3. Shares of chip maker Intel Corp ( INTC.O ) jumped 4.7 percent after Lehman Brothers raised its price target on the stock, citing strength in notebooks and servers. Crude oil futures fell to below $122 a barrel during the session, but shares of energy companies gained as investment bank UBS sharply raised its projection for oil prices. Shares of Exxon Mobil Corp ( XOM.N ) advanced 1.6 percent to $91.30. News late in the session that key members of the U.S. Senate reached a deal on a housing rescue plan raised hopes for the beleaguered home market. Financier Carl Icahn started a proxy battle to get control of Yahoo and force it to strike a deal with Microsoft Corp ( MSFT.O ). Other deal news included CBS Corp's ( CBS.N ) plan to buy CNET Networks ( CNET.O ). "Tech is doing great ... That's very encouraging and the Nasdaq chart is the strongest one out there right now," said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading, in Chatham, New Jersey. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  shot up 94.28 points, or 0.73 percent, to end at 12,992.66. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  rose 14.91 points, or 1.06 percent, to 1,423.57. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  climbed 37.03 points, or 1.48 percent, to close at 2,533.73. Trading volume continued to be very light on the New York Stock Exchange, with about 1.20 billion shares changing hands, well below last year's estimated daily average of roughly 1.90 billion. On Monday, NYSE volume hit its low for the year at 1.05 billion. SOXX UP, CNET SOARS Intel was up $1.13 at $24.97, while the Philadelphia Stock Exchange index of semiconductors .SOXX rose 2.1 percent. June crude dipped 10 cents to settle at $124.12. Traders said a surprisingly large increase in U.S. natural gas inventories contributed to crude's fall. Earlier this week, U.S. crude hit an intraday record at $126.98 a barrel. "Oil sold off, which was nice, even though it's still very high. That's part of what happened," said Todd Leone. head of listed trading at Cowen & Co. in New York. In the sweeping housing rescue plan, the two largest U.S. housing finance companies, Fannie Mae FNM.N and Freddie Mac FRE.N, would backstop a government mortgage insurance fund, two industry sources told Reuters. Shares of home builders surged after the news. An index of home builders .DJUSHB rose 3.7 percent. On the Nasdaq, Yahoo shares gained 2.3 percent to $27.75, while Microsoft rose 1.7 percent to $30.45. When talks between Microsoft and Yahoo ended earlier this month, the software company was offering $33 a share for Yahoo, but the Internet company was holding out for $37. Shares of CBS slid 2.4 percent to $24.23 on the NYSE, while shares of CNET surged 43.5 percent to $11.41. CNET was the Nasdaq's second-biggest percentage gainer. JC PENNEY SHINES Retailers benefited after JC Penney Co Inc ( JCP.N ) said its earnings in the current quarter could top analysts' forecasts. The outlook drove JC Penney's battered stock up 4.7 percent to $46.32 even though it posted a 50 percent profit drop in the first quarter.  Data painted a mostly weak picture of the U.S. economy. A report showed softer-than-expected U.S. industrial output for April and a manufacturing report from the New York Federal Reserve Bank was also weak. Meanwhile, initial jobless claims rose slightly more than expected in the latest week. Volume on Nasdaq was stronger than on the NYSE. About 2.22 billion shares traded, above last year's daily average of 2.17 billion. Advancing stocks outnumbered declining ones by a ratio of about 7 to 3 on the NYSE and by 8 to 5 on Nasdaq.
