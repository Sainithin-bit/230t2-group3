 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors are expected to 
approach UBS AG ( UBSN.VX ) with a subpoena for the names of rich 
American clients who may have used the Swiss bank's services to 
skirt income taxes, the Wall Street Journal said on Thursday, 
citing lawyers and others involved in the case. 

  The subpoena would follow the unsealing of a grand jury 
indictment on Tuesday in Florida federal court, of former UBS 
private banker Bradley Birkenfeld and Liechtenstein businessman 
Mario Staggl, the report said.  The one-count indictment charged Birkenfeld and Staggl with 
conspiring to defraud the United States by helping an 
unidentified U.S. citizen create bogus corporations and other 
entities to conceal his ownership of hidden offshore assets, 
according to an earlier statement from prosecutors.  Officials of UBS and the Internal Revenue Service could not 
be reached immediately for comment.  (Reporting by  Aarthi Sivaraman ; Editing by  David Holmes )
