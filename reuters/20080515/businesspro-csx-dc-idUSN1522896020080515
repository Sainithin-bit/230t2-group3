 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. railroad CSX Corp ( CSX.N ) said on 
Thursday its board is unanimously opposed to an agenda put 
forward by activist investor group The Children's Investment 
Fund (TCI), and is asking shareholders to re-elect its 
directors. 

  TCI earlier this month proposed a minority slate of five 
directors, saying CSX lags its peers on key operational 
metrics, while its executives award themselves with the 
industry's highest compensation.  CSX said in the letter to shareholders that London-based 
TCI's ideas are "based on flawed assumptions and half truths."  "TCI Group has offered ideas that would either destroy 
value or are already under way at CSX. It is no wonder that 
they have tried to keep you focused on loosely knit and flawed 
comparisons to other railroads," the letter said.  CSX added that it has narrowed a gap in expenses compared 
with rival Canadian National Railway Co ( CNR.TO ), and said its 
prices are at parity with Norfolk Southern Corp ( NSC.N ), 
rejecting two TCI arguments.  "CSX has the strongest 2008 pricing guidance in the 
industry," the letter said.  It also said its productivity gains have exceeded $500 
million since 2003, with at least an additional $400 million in 
productivity targeted through 2010.  TCI and 3G Capital said on May 5 they together own an 8.7 
percent stake in CSX, whose shareholder meeting is scheduled 
for Wednesday, June 25.  CSX shares were little changed at $65.39 in early New York 
Stock Exchange trading.  (Reporting by Nick Zieminski, editing by Maureen Bavdek)
