 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - T. Boone Pickens' Mesa Power LLP placed a $2 billion order for 667 wind turbines with General Electric to build the world's largest wind farm in the Texas Panhandle, the Dallas Morning News reported Thursday. 

 A spokesman for Mesa Power declined to comment on the article. Mesa Power plans to announce the deal later Thursday, according to the newspaper. The wind farm would produce 1,000 megawatts of electricity, enough to power about 300,000 homes. By 2014, Pickens has said he wants to have 4,000 MW of wind power.
