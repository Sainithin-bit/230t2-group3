 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The top Republican on the U.S. Senate Banking Committee on Thursday said he was working with the White House as he negotiated with Democrats on a housing bill, adding that the two sides were close to a deal. 

 "We're working with the White House in these negotiations ... and we're trying to come forth with good legislation," Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby said on CNBC. Shelby concurred with Democratic Sen. Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, the chairman of the banking panel that the two sides were very close to a deal and he said he wanted to ensure taxpayers were safeguarded. He said he would ask Dodd to push back into the afternoon a committee meeting set for 10 a.m. (1400 GMT) to draft the bill. (Reporting by  Tim Ahmann ; Editing by Theodore d'Afflisio)
