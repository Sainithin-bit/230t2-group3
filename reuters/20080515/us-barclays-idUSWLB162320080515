 LONDON  (Reuters) - Britain's Barclays held off bolstering its capital on Thursday, prompting criticism it was in denial, but French rival Credit Agricole and other European banks took steps to boost balance sheets hit by the credit crunch. 

 Barclays ( BARC.L ) confidence about its capital position was not matched by analysts and shares dipped on concern that with one of the thinnest capital cushions in Europe its future growth could be constrained. The bank refused to rule out a rights issue in the future. "We are clear that all options remain available ... we are not going to rule in or rule out anything," said Chris Lucas, finance director. Analysts at Citi said the bank was "in denial" about its capital position. European banks unveiled over 3 billion euros ($4.6 billion) in losses on Thursday as the impact of the U.S. subprime housing crisis and its fallout on asset valuations took a further toll. Asset sales, cost cutting and possibly more rights issues could all be used to shore up capital, especially as revenue and profits appear set to fall or slow in fragile financial markets. Regulators and investors are encouraging banks to hold more capital as a buffer to protect depositors, due to heightened concern about more losses. Credit Agricole ( CAGR.PA ), France's biggest retail bank, confirmed it plans to raise 5.9 billion euros through a rights issue and said it wants to sell assets and restructure its investment bank arm, Calyon. Agricole, slightly smaller in size than Barclays to rank just outside Europe's top 10 banks, identified about 5 billion euros of potential disposals over the next 18 months. It will also cut 10 percent of Calyon's costs, after the unit took a 1.2 billion euro writedown on risky assets in the first quarter. MORE HITS Barclays took a 1 billion pound ($1.9 billion) loss on its assets in the first quarter, leaving group profits lower than a year ago. The writedown was net of a 700 million pound gain on the fair valuation of debt it carries on its owns books, but 500 million of that gain reversed in April. The bank said it was comfortable with analysts forecasts predicting a 10 percent drop in profits this year, mainly due to the impact of the slowdown on its Barclays Capital investment bank arm. Belgian financial firm KBC ( KBC.BR ) reported a 27 percent first quarter profit drop and France's Natixis ( CNAT.PA ) posted an 88 percent slump in quarterly earnings as they marked down asset values and felt the impact of the market slowdown. KBC said it will suspend a share buyback programme to preserve capital and Natixis plans to cut its fixed cost base by one-tenth. By 1400 GMT Barclays and Agricole shares were each down 2 percent, KBC was down 6 percent, but Natixis shares were up 14 percent. The DJ Banks index dipped 0.3 percent. Italian and Spanish banks have been shielded from the worst of the impact due to a traditionally more risk-averse strategy, but Italy's Monte Paschi ( BMPS.MI ) took a modest hit and underlying profits fell. Belgian-Dutch financial services group Fortis FOR.BR said it plans a perpetual bond issue to lift its capital position, after its balance sheet was strained by its part in last year's purchase of ABN AMRO, the world's biggest bank takeover. Investors in Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ), which led the consortium deal for ABN, on Thursday felt the impact of the 12 billion pound rights issue unveiled last month, as the impact of the share dilution took effect. Germany's Commerzbank ( CBKG.DE ) said it could seek to raise capital, but not as a defensive move. Its outgoing chief executive asked shareholders to allow the bank to raise capital to give it financial firepower for any deals that could emerge. (Editing by Elaine Hardcastle)
