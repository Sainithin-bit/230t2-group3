 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Top Federal Reserve officials on Thursday cited progress in alleviating months of turmoil in financial markets, but said a full return to normalcy was still some time away. 

 The recent credit woes underscore the need for banks to hold "generous" capital cushions, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said, as he urged banks to actively raise money and prepare for better times that lie ahead. "I strongly urge financial institutions to remain proactive in their capital-raising efforts," Bernanke said in a speech at the Chicago Fed's 44th annual bank structure conference. "Doing so not only helps the broader economy but positions firms to take advantage of new profit opportunities as conditions in the financial markets and the economy improve," he said. This year's theme is "Credit Market Turmoil: Causes, Consequences and Cures." Bernanke and the New York Fed's William Dudley, who oversees financial markets for the central bank, had plenty of grist for the analysis mill. Fed watchers believe that the Fed is pushing banks to redouble efforts to get past the months-long credit crisis -- just as the Fed has raised its own game, innovating ways to bolster market liquidity when it was desperately needed. Cary Leahey, an economist with Decision Economics in New York, said Bernanke was urging banks to continue their efforts to get rid of less productive assets so that they can resume more normal lending patterns. "The Fed thinks it's done a lot to ease the credit crisis and now the financial institutions have to pick up the ball and run with it," Leahey said. A year ago at the Chicago Fed's conference, Bernanke said he expected little spillover from problems in subprime mortgages to the broader economy. In hindsight, Bernanke said, it was evident that "problems occurred at each step of the credit-extension chain" and had contributed to the credit crisis that has driven the economy to the wall. Bernanke said the success of many banks in raising new capital has been encouraging, and praised the often contentious foreign-owned sovereign wealth funds for their role in supplying capital at a time of need. "They have generally provided unleveraged, patient money, which is what is needed here. They have not asked for extensive control or management of the firms," he said. "It has been very constructive to have had this source of funding coming into our banking systems." Raising capital and repairing balance sheets "allow for the extension of new credit, which supports economic expansion," he added. INTERESTING TIMES Dudley, the Fed's money market operations guru, spoke about the credit crisis for the first time since October, in comments titled, "May You Live in Interesting Times: The Sequel." Contrary to a recent study by two leading economists, Dudley said evidence suggests that the Fed's lineup of new emergency lending facilities has improved financial market function in recent months. Still, problems in the banking sector -- especially deleveraging, or the shedding of assets now viewed as too risky or illiquid by financial institutions -- will not be easily worked through, Dudley said. "It will take time for market function to return to normal. The reintermediation and deleveraging process has, in my view, a considerable ways to go," he said. Especially, Dudley suggested, because the Fed cannot solve all the banks' problems, despite a commitment to supply liquidity "as needed." The Fed's willingness to provide liquidity against less liquid collateral has smoothed out and extended -- but not prevented -- the credit market's shakeout, he said. This less jagged process "causes less damage to the financial system and less pernicious macroeconomic consequences," Dudley said. Smoother or not, the credit crisis that was brewing in early 2007, and hit with hurricane force in August, has pushed the United States economy to the brink of recession. Dudley said that the recent widening in certain interest rate spreads suggested "increased balance sheet pressure on banks." And if that is the case, the Fed can only do so much to help. "There are limits to what the Federal Reserve can accomplish in terms of narrowing such funding spreads. After all, the Fed's actions cannot create bank capital or ease balance sheet constraints materially," he said. (Additional reporting by  Alister Bull  in Washington; Editing by Leslie Adler)
