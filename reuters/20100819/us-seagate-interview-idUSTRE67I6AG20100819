 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Seagate Technology expects average prices for its hard drives to slide in September amid an industry glut, but is hopeful prices will bounce back in the final quarter of 2010 on solid holiday season spending. 

 Chief Financial Officer Patrick O'Malley told Reuters on Thursday that drive production had been too high in recent months, adding to supply, but he foresaw a strong holiday season with consumers buying PCs and propping up drive demand. "I'd say it's an average back-to-school. I'd say in our sector we feel pretty comfortable with where that is," O'Malley told Reuters in an interview. "There was a bigger concern that it was not going to be average because maybe the consumer was not going to show up. ... The consumer is still standing, the consumer is still buying so we're pretty happy with that," he said. "The commercial refresh is going OK," he added. O'Malley said that Seagate, the largest hard drive manufacturer by revenue, could see average selling prices fall in September as it fights to maintain its market share against rivals Western Digital and Hitachi. Total hard drive shipments for the entire industry are expected to reach 657 million units this year, an 18 percent increase from 2009, said John Rydning, research director for hard disk drives at IDC. Total revenue is expected to increase to between $34 billion and $35 billion from $29.6 billion last year, he said. (Reporting by Alex Dobuzinskis: Editing by Phil Berlowitz)
