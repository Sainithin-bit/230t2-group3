 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Computer-makers Dell Inc and Hewlett-Packard Co posted higher profits on Thursday but both companies' shares drifted lower in after-hours trading as doubts remain over the strength of the revival in technology spending. 

 The following are immediate comments from investors and analysts. DELL LOUIS MISCIOSCIA, ANALYST, COLLINS STEWART "It's nice that they've met and beat expectations here but it seems to be reasonably modest. Their turnaround is four years in the making. It's more likely to  take another six to 12 months to really tell whether the turnaround is taking hold or not." "We still remain constructive on the tech sector... but it's definitely slower compared to what our prior view was a couple months ago, which obviously is disappointing. The consumer has definitely slowed. We would expect second half results will be decently strong for tech, but not as strong as our prior view." MICHAEL HOLT, ANALYST, MORNINGSTAR "People were spooked after Cisco cited uncertainty and now people are more concerned about how the rest of the year will play out. Any kind of cautious comments about the outlook will spook investors." MARTIN REYNOLDS, ANALYST, GARTNER "We've seen a recovery in corporate buying after putting off purchases last year and have been expecting Dell to benefit." JANE SNOREK, ANALYST, FIRST AMERICAN FUNDS "I thought they (results) looked good. They said their enterprise business is up and revenue guidance looked good. If you own Dell, you should be looking forward to next year. They gave a lot of positive commentary and said the refresh cycle was well under way. HEWLETT-PACKARD MARTIN REYNOLDS, ANALYST, GARTNER "It's a great quarter coming off an awful quarter last year. Revenues are down from the second quarter, which certainly suggests the recovery trajectory is slowing. Looking ahead, they're going to start running against tougher comparisons and potential currency pressures, so we're cautiously optimistic for the second half of the year. Although there are troubling signs, we think the technology industry will remain robust." MICHAEL HOLT, ANALYST, MORNINGSTAR "Europe has held up well and the printing group is skewing toward commercial versus consumer, which is a positive. They also showed solid progress in networking, which is a key segment we're watching in the battle against Cisco. (Reporting by  Sue Zeidler  and  Ritsuko Ando )
