 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Ellyn McColgan, the former head of wealth management at Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ), has joined the board of financial services firm Primerica Inc ( PRI.N ), the company said on Thursday. 

 McColgan joined Morgan Stanley in April 2008 after a 17-year career at Fidelity Investments. McColgan stayed left in January 2009 amid an executive reshuffle following the creation of a joint venture between Morgan Stanley's wealth management unit and Smith Barney, a unit of Citigroup Inc ( C.N ). Primerica, which sells life insurance and other financial products, was spun off from its former parent company Citigroup in an initial public offering in April. (Reporting by Helen Kearney.
