 Kyoto, Japan  (Reuters) - GS Yuasa Corp ( 6674.T ), which makes batteries for the Boeing Co ( BA.N ) Dreamliner, said on Tuesday its earnings would not be impacted by the grounding of the 787 passenger jets, nor did it see any reputational impact on its other lithium-ion batteries. 
 The Kyoto-based company maintained its operating profit forecast of 10 billion yen ($107.88 million) for the year to end-March. All Boeing's 787s are out of action as investigators in Japan and the United States try to find the cause of two incidents with the plane's lithium-ion batteries - a battery fire on a Japan Airlines ( 9201.T ) 787 at a U.S. airport and an emergency landing on a domestic All Nippon Airways ( 9202.T ) flight after battery problems triggered a smoke alarm.
