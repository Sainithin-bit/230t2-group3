 LONDON  (Reuters) - Barclays Plc's chairman said he has more new non-executive directors "in the pipeline" to join as part of his plan to shake-up the British bank after a string of scandals. 
 David Walker said he expected more non-executives to be announced later this year. He was testifying to UK lawmakers at a parliamentary inquiry into banking industry standards, who asked if cultural problems at the bank were "endemic". (Reporting by  Steve Slater ; Editing by Matt Scuffham)
