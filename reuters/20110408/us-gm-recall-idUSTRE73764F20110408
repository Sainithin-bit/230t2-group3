 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Co is recalling about 2,100 Chevrolet Cruze small cars to inspect for an improperly fastened steering wheel after discovering one vehicle with the defect. 

 There have been no crashes or injuries related to the vehicle with the problem, GM said. The possibly affected vehicles are for the model year 2011, GM said. "We are confident this is the only vehicle with this condition," said Jeff Boyer, GM executive director of safety, said in a statement. The Cruze small car was launched overseas in late 2009 and in the United States in September 2010. It replaced the Chevrolet Cobalt in the U.S. market and other models overseas. GM has said its Cruze small car was on track to exceed 50,000 U.S. sales in the first quarter. More than 100,000 Cruzes have been built since the start of production in the United States, GM said.
