 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - House of Representatives Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer said on Friday that budget negotiators were "very close" to a deal to avoid a shutdown of the federal government. 

 "There's no deal yet unfortunately," Hoyer told NBC's Today show program as negotiators worked furiously to reach agreement. "I think we're very close. I think we've come 70 percent of the way in terms of dollars. That's a long way to go in trying to reach compromise." (Reporting by  David Morgan ; Editing by  Vicki Allen )
