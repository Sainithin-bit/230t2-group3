 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ) will start cutting production at its North American plants next week to adjust for supply disruptions stemming from the March 11 earthquake in Japan, the company said on Friday. 

 That earthquake forced auto parts suppliers in Japan to shut down or operate at reduced capacity, which has caused parts shortages for the global auto industry. Toyota said it will suspend production at its North American vehicle plants on April 15, 18, 22 and 25. Most of Toyota's plants will also be shut down on April 21 except for its plant in Georgetown, Kentucky. Most of the company's North American engine and component plants will follow the same schedule, Toyota said. From March 11 to April 25, Toyota estimates that it will produce 35,000 fewer vehicles in North America than previously estimated, Toyota spokesman Mike Goss said. The company has not made any decisions about North American production beyond April 25. (Reporting by  Deepa Seetharaman , editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
