 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Democrats in Congress will push on Friday to avoid a federal shutdown with a "clean" temporary funding bill, Representative Steny Hoyer, the No. 2 Democrat in the House of Representatives, told CNN. 

 The Republican-led House on Thursday defied a White House veto threat and passed a bill to keep the government running for another week, but on the condition of $12 billion in spending cuts. (Washington World Desk)
