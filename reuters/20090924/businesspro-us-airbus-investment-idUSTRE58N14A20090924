 PARIS  (Reuters) - Airbus ( EAD.PA ), the world's largest civil planemaker, needs at least an extra 800 million euros ($1.2 billion) over six years to develop greener and faster planes, Chief Operating Officer Fabrice Bregier told Le Figaro newspaper. 

 "We estimate that an extra 800 million euros to 1 billion euros ... will be needed on top of existing industrial investments to launch the new generation of civil planes by 2015," Bregier said in the interview published on Thursday. Bregier appealed to the French government to include the aerospace sector in its future investments. The European aerospace sector is seeking to preserve its technological lead from new competitors like China, which will launch its new C919 jumbo jet by 2015-2020, Bregier added. By 2015, the new Airbus planes would emit 50 percent less carbon dioxide and would be 50 percent less noisy, thanks to new "open rotors" reactors placed on the back of the plane, rather than on the wings, Bregier said.
