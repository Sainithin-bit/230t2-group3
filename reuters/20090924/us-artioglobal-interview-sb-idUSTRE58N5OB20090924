 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Artio Global Investors Inc ART.N, forced to wait through 17 months of market turmoil before making its New York Stock Exchange debut Thursday, is counting on rising U.S. investor demand for international stocks. 

 "We think institutional investors and even individual investors are somewhere in the process of globalizing their portfolios," Artio Chief Executive Richard Pell said in an interview Thursday. U.S. investors overall control roughly $10 trillion, Pell said, so even a 1 percent shift in allocations translates to $100 billion in potential fund flows. Artio also intends to boost its $53 billion in assets under management by attracting investors to four U.S. stock funds, all launched three years ago, and its fixed income funds. "We think we have lot of potential weapons," said Pell, also Artio's chief investment officer. Shares of Artio earlier Thursday debuted on the New York Stock Exchange, rising nearly 4 percent from its IPO price of $26 a share. More than $650 million of the new stock was sold Wednesday night. The shares now fetch about 22 times annualized 2009 earnings, based on pro forma first-half results disclosed in the prospectus. Yet the former U.S. asset management arm of Swiss bank Julius Baer Holding AG ( BAER.VX ) does not immediately benefit from the offering. TERM DEBT Some $300 million of the proceeds went to Baer, which retains a large minority stake, while Pell and Rudolph-Riad Younes, head of international equity, each reaped $28 million windfalls from the flotation. Artio received no cash from the sale, according to the prospectus. The funds firm actually added debt to its balance sheet. In connection with the IPO, the firm took out $60 million of term debt from a syndicate of banks, working capital to run the business and provide some seed money. "Our business is very cash flow positive, so we expect over time to pay down that debt, build up the quality of the balance sheet," Pell said. "Ultimately there may be some flexibility to increase the dividend to shareholders, perhaps significantly." One key benefit of the IPO is giving Artio a currency for attracting employees, he said. "We had a little celebration on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange last night ... There was a lot of enthusiasm down there," Pell recalled. "For the first time, we have a pure, liquid, publicly quoted currency we can use to attract world-class talent." He is less inclined to use that currency for takeovers at a time many U.S. banks shed asset management units for cash. "We anticipate our primary engine of growth will be organic growth," Pell said. Artio initially filed its plans for an IPO in February 2008, after Goldman Sachs' ( GS.N ) initial efforts to find a buyer fell short late in 2007. But the offering had to wait as credit markets tumbled and Lehman Brothers collapsed. The firm's timing looks good right now, as Artio completes the first financial services IPO since June of last year. (Editing by  Gary Hill )
