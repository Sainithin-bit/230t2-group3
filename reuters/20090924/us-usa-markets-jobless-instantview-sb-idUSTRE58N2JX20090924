 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The number of U.S. workers filing new claims for jobless benefits unexpectedly fell 21,000 last week, government data showed on Thursday, and a less volatile unemployment claims gauge dipped to an eight-month low. 

 KEY POINTS: * The number of U.S. workers filing new claims for jobless benefits unexpectedly fell 21,000 last week, government data showed on Thursday, and a less volatile unemployment claims gauge dipped to an eight-month low. * Initial claims for state unemployment insurance declined to a seasonally adjusted 530,000 in the week ending September 19 from a revised 551,000 in the previous week. Analysts polled by Reuters were expecting claims to rise to 550,000 from a previously reported 545,000. * The four-week moving average of new claims dipped to 553,500, the lowest since 547,000 in the week ending January 24. * The week's decline was affected by seasonal factors, a Labor Department analyst said. Seasonal adjustments anticipate a rise in claims in the week after the Labor Day federal holiday, and an unadjusted increase in claims fell short of the expected increase, the official said. * Continued claims of workers still on jobless aid after an initial week of benefits fell by a bigger-than-expected 123,000 to 6.138 million in the week ending September 12. Analysts were expecting claims to dip to 6.19 million. COMMENTS: JACK SPITZ, MANAGING DIRECTOR OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE, NATIONAL BANK OF CANADA, TORONTO: "From a trend perspective, the numbers on balance this morning were pretty good. This does show that there is some employment, the trend is marginally dollar positive." ANDREW BUSCH, GLOBAL FX STRATEGIST, BMO CAPITAL MARKETS, CHICAGO: "Both continuing claims and initial jobless claims are a little bit better than expected. It's moving in the right direction, but they are not going to necessarily change the direction of unemployment that should still continue to climb. We're going to have to see these numbers well below 500,000 to get the unemployment rate to really start to come off or change its direction. We've seen these numbers interpreted by the market as a positive." KIM RUPERT, MANAGING DIRECTOR, GLOBAL FIXED INCOME ANALYSIS, ACTION ECONOMICS LLC, SAN FRANCISCO: "The decline was a little bit larger than we and most others expected. Nevertheless the level stays pretty high at least relative to where we'd hope it would be if we were seeing a stronger recovery in the economy. That's still marginally disappointing. "Treasuries dipped fractionally on the news but I don't we'll see any major market developments here." GARY THAYER, MACROSTRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO ADVISORS, ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI: "New jobless claims were fewer than expected, but more important, the number fits the continuing trend downward in new jobless claims. That tells us the labor market is stabilizing. We're not quite down to the level yet that would signal that the economy is creating more jobs than it is losing, but we could reach that point later this year or early next year. CHRISTOPHER LOW, CHIEF ECONOMIST, FTN FINANCIAL, NEW YORK "This confirms the downward trend. Jobless claims have been improving since the end of March. Recoveries since the 1960s show that it's not so much the level of claims but the direction. The slow rate of decline is a reminder that it will take a long time for the job slack to diminish. The recession took a lot of damage; it will take two or three before the job market recovers." STEVE GOLDMAN, MARKET STRATEGIST, WEEDEN & CO., GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT: "Data is again better than expected -- expecting 550 came in at 530. Overall for the market, slightly positive news. After the 2 percent reversal yesterday, it's helping to support stock prices. "Overall, the market is likely to find support at modestly lower levels. There is still a great deal of momentum behind the market, a great deal of stock participation, with most stock sectors and industries punching through, or at new 50-day highs over the past session or two. So everything should be orderly as far as any pullback that may possibly materialize." SUBODH KUMAR, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, SUBODH KUMAR & ASSOCIATES, TORONTO: "In my opinion having a jobless number above 500,000 is still a lot, but I don't think this number will move the market. People were expecting this, and to move the market now you'd have to have a number below 500,000. These numbers aren't strong enough for even the bullish people to think things are getting a lot better." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stock index futures were slightly higher. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices were little changed. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar fell against the euro and yen.
