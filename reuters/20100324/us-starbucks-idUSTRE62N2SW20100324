 SEATTLE  (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp ( SBUX.O ) declared its first dividend on Wednesday, joining food and beverage companies like McDonald's Corp ( MCD.N ) and Coca-Cola Co ( KO.N ) in making payouts to shareholders. 

 While dividends tend to be favored by mature, slow-growth companies, Chief Executive Howard Schultz said at the coffee chain's annual meeting that the move signaled a reframing of its growth strategy. "The dividend is our opportunity to reward our shareholders," he said. Schultz bought Starbucks Coffee Co in 1987 and transformed the small Seattle outfit into one of the world's most recognized brands. He was at the helm at the fast-growing company from 1987 to 2000 and remained a very active chairman. Schultz retook the reins in 2008 and slashed nearly $600 million in costs by shuttering hundreds of U.S. stores and putting the brakes on aggressive international expansion. On Wednesday he said the company was now ready to expand its U.S. store base and accelerate international expansion. Schultz also expects growth in results from boosting profitability in existing cafes and turning Via instant coffee and Seattle's Best Coffee into billion-dollar businesses. To that end, Chief Financial Officer Troy Alstead said Starbucks would "significantly and rapidly grow shareholder returns" in 2010. The company also announced plans to buy back 15 million common shares on top of 6.3 million shares remaining under previous authorizations. "We applaud the increased return of cash to shareholders," Oppenheimer analyst Matt DiFrisco said, echoing the sentiment of investors gathered for the company's annual meeting. Starbucks shares, which touched a 52-week high of $26 during the trading session, were down 0.5 percent to $25.28 in the afternoon. PROFIT-SHARING Public companies use dividends to distribute a portion of profits to shareholders. Mature companies are most likely to offer dividends, since younger, fast-growing companies tend to steer business proceeds into expansion efforts. Starbucks set a quarterly dividend of 10 cents per share. It will be paid on April 23 to shareholders of record at the close of business on April 7. The 10-cent quarterly dividend was higher than the roughly 6-cent dividend payout Wall Street had expected, Bernstein restaurant analyst Sara Senatore said in a client note. Starbucks is initially targeting a dividend payout range of 35 percent to 40 percent of net income, which Senatore said is consistent with other restaurant companies including KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut parent Yum Brands Inc ( YUM.N ). The formerly fast-growth company hit a wall in late 2007 as the U.S. economy was sliding into recession. Schultz returned as CEO soon after and closed around 900 unprofitable cafes. Starbucks, which also squeezed out waste at the store level, now expects to generate free cash flow of around $1 billion for the current fiscal year ending in September. "There were years when we didn't know if we could pay our bills ... What a difference a year makes," Schultz told investors. "We are more optimistic than ever about the future of the company." For the latest quarter, the chain posted a 4 percent rise in U.S. same-store sales -- its first quarterly gain in sales at established domestic restaurants in two years. Starbucks shares have gained more than 35 percent since Schultz returned, compared with nearly a 20 percent decline in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  over the same period. "I'm glad he's back," said annual meeting attendee Doris Cole, 80, who visits Starbucks nearly every day and has owned shares in the company since it went public in 1992.
