 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilder Lennar Corp ( LEN.N ) reported a narrower-than-expected quarterly loss, helped by rising prices and lower expenses, and said it was on track to make a profit in 2010. 

 The news boosted Lennar's shares to $18.32, the highest level since May 21, 2008, and helped the homebuilding industry shrug off data that showed U.S. new home sales fell 2.2 percent in February, the fourth straight month of declines. Miami-based Lennar -- one of the top three U.S. builders, along with Pulte Group Inc ( PHM.N ) and D.R. Horton Inc ( DHI.N ) -- reported a first-quarter loss of $6.5 million, or 4 cents per share, compared with a loss of $155.9 million, or 98 cents per share, a year earlier. On average, analysts had expected a loss of 30 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "Lennar was the first one to take drastic action going into the downturn," said Morningstar analyst Eric Landry. "The same thing is happening on the upturn." Earlier than its rivals, Lennar began to replenish its land supply at cheaper, downturn-era prices, Landry said. This quarter's plumped-up margins -- 19.2 percent compared with 6.5 percent last year -- reflected that decision, he added. A 6 percent increase in average home sale prices and a decline in expenses helped as well. Lennar's early move back into the land market will give it a competitive advantage in the form of easier access to land and revenue from a new line of business, Rialto Investments, Landry said. Lennar, which builds in 16 states, said on Wednesday it would begin reporting results for Rialto, which acquires and sells distressed loans and securities portfolios. Analyst Dan Oppenheim, in a note to clients, said the business should add modestly to profits for the rest of 2010. "It's not in our or our investors' best interest to have a lot of cash on our books earning 1 percent or less," said Chief Executive Stuart Miller on a conference call with analysts. Lennar also purchased the right to buy 2,700 home sites from Starwood Land Ventures LLC and bought two loan portfolios backed by real estate assets from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. More such deals will likely follow, creating low-risk profit for Lennar, Raymond James analyst Buck Horne wrote in a client note. Lennar's revenue fell 3 percent to $574.4 million in its fiscal first quarter ended February 28, but topped analysts' average forecast of $568.2 million. But orders rose 18 percent despite reduced sales incentives for home buyers. As a percentage of home sales revenue, incentives fell to 12.5 percent from 17.1 percent a year earlier. Led by Lennar, the Dow Jones U.S. Home Construction Index .DJUSHB was up 1.5 percent even as the national data heightened fears of renewed weakness in the housing market. In addition to lower U.S. new home sales last month, sales of existing homes also fell, by 0.6 percent, according to the National Association of Realtors. Severe weather, including blizzards that battered the densely populated Northeast, may have been a factor. But the federal tax credit for homebuyers, set to expire at the end of April, may have pulled demand forward, creating a soft patch despite the spring selling season. "The stream of buyers enticed by the home buyer tax credit has been less than expected," John Burns, an Irvine, California-based real estate consultant, wrote in his monthly report. The credit's expiration will not handicap Lennar, Miller said. "It's not going to cause significant issues for us," he said. "It's a nice thing, but it's not driving the business." Lennar shares were up 76 cents, or 4.45 percent, to $17.82 on the New York Stock Exchange at mid-afternoon. The shares are up 81 percent in the past year, compared with a 6 percent rise for industry No. 1 Pulte Group and a 35 percent rise for the home construction index. Lennar shares have risen 9 percent since February 10, when it announced its transaction with the FDIC.
