 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ) plans to reorganize domestic manufacturing operations across group companies to consolidate production of similar vehicles regardless of brand, the Nikkei business daily said. 

 This move is aimed at boosting productivity, lowering costs and ensuring quality, the newspaper said. The company makes vehicles in Japan at 18 plants, including four of its own and facilities operated by manufacturing units as well as Daihatsu Motor Co ( 7262.T ) and Hino Motors Ltd ( 7205.T ). By phasing in the reorganization as new and updated models are introduced, Toyota aims to complete the transformation by the end of the decade, the Nikkei said. Toyota has set a goal of shaving 100 billion yen off its annual production costs by 2012 by increasing the use of common parts among different models, the newspaper added.
