 BEIJING  (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) is keen to expand in China, Chief Executive Brian Moynihan said on Wednesday. 

 Bank of America, the largest U.S. commercial bank by assets, holds an 11 percent stake in China Construction Bank ( 0939.HK ) ( 601939.SS ), the country's second-largest lender. The bank's board recently approved a plan to seek local incorporation in China after months of discussions and delays, according to media reports. Moynihan was speaking to reporters on his first trip to China since he became CEO at the start of this year. (Reporting by Michael Wei and  Simon Rabinovitch ; editing by  Ken Wills )
