 TEL AVIV  (Reuters) - Delek US Holdings Inc ( DK.N ) has begun negotiations to purchase a U.S. refinery in a possible $1 billion deal, parent company Delek Group Ltd DELKG.TA said on Sunday. 

 In a statement to the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, Delek Group did not identify its negotiating partner or the refinery, which it said could produce between 75,000 and 100,000 barrels per day. Delek Group said a deal could include the purchase of fuel tankers and agreements to supply 400 to 450 gas stations and convenience stores. It said Delek US Holdings Inc was holding preliminary negotiations and it was impossible at this stage to assess whether a deal would be agreed or when one might be completed.
