 SEOUL  (Reuters) - Business sentiment at big South Korean 
companies has hit its lowest in more than three years due to 
worries about soaring oil and raw material prices and sluggish 
domestic consumption, a private survey showed on Sunday. 

  Concern about street protests triggered by a deal to reopen 
the country to beef imports from the United States and the 
prospect of labor union strikes over pay added to the 
pessimistic view, the Federation of Korean Industries (FKI) 
said in a statement on its survey about the business climate 
for July.  The business survey index compiled by the FKI, the 
country's biggest lobby group for large companies, fell to a 
seasonally adjusted 91.2 for July from a revised 96.3 for June.  The figure is the lowest since 82.3 in January 2005.  A reading below 100 means more companies expect their 
business conditions to worsen than to improve.  Unionized metal industry workers in South Korea, including 
those at car makers such as Hyundai Motor Co ( 005380.KS ), said 
that they would stop work for two hours on Wednesday to demand 
a reworking of the beef deal with the United States.
