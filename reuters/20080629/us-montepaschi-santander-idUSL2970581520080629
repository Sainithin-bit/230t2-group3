 MILAN  (Reuters) - Bank Santander ( SAN.MC ) has over 2 percent of Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena ( BMPS.MI ), the Italian mid-sized lender which bought Antonveneta bank from the Spanish giant, Il Messaggero newspaper reported on Sunday. 

 "The Spanish bank should make it official within a few days that it has a notifiable stake," Il Messaggero said, quoting sources close to Santander. Monte Paschi declined to comment. No-one at Santander was available to comment. Under rules laid down by Italian bourse regulator Consob, stakes above 2 percent in a listed company must be disclosed by investors. Monte Paschi is controlled by a banking foundation with a 53 percent stake. The two banks have been in talks about possible cooperation after they closed the deal for Monte Paschi to buy Antonveneta for 9 billion euros ($14.17 billion).
