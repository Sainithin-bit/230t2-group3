 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - A German regional court has opened the door to an investor law suit against credit rating agency Standard & Poor's over its assessment of Lehman Brothers securities before the collapse of the U.S. investment bank. 
 The Frankfurt higher regional court rejected a lower court ruling that had found the court had no jurisdiction. "The case will be sent back to the lower Frankfurt court for action and a decision," a spokeswoman for the higher regional court said on Monday. The German court has jurisdiction because S&P has assets in Germany and the person bringing the suit is a German resident, the higher regional court said in a statement. German law firm KWAG brought the suit on behalf of an investor who had bought 30,000 euros ($40,000) worth of Lehman securities based on a favorable S&P rating, a spokesman for KWAG said. The ruling could open the door to further suits, he said. Lehman Brothers collapsed in September 2008. An S&P spokeswoman declined comment.
