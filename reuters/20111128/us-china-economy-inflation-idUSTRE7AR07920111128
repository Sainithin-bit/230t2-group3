 BEIJING  (Reuters) - China's annual inflation in 2011 is likely to be about 5.5 percent and inflationary pressures will remain next year, Commerce Minister Chen Deming said on Monday. 
 The pace of price rises will overshoot the government's target of 4 percent set earlier this year. Chen also said the country faces risks of further economic slowdown in 2012.
