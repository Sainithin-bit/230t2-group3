 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Jeweler Tiffany & Co ( TIF.N ) reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Friday helped by stronger international sales, and raised its full-year profit forecast. 

 The New York-based jeweler is expected to derive a significant chunk of its sales in the December holiday shopping season. Jewelers can derive up to 25 percent of their annual sales in December alone, according to Spending Pulse, the retail data service of MasterCard Advisors. Investors and retailers, however, fear that U.S. consumers, facing high gas and food costs and a housing market downturn, will not spend their holiday dollars as freely this season as in past years. Still, analysts expect luxury retailers to emerge relatively unscathed from this holiday season, as their wealthy customers, who tend not to worry about gas or food prices, are expected to keep spending. "We are now one month into the all-important November-December holiday season and are pleased with overall sales growth that is meeting our expectations," Chief Executive Michael Kowalski said in a statement. Kowalski said it was premature to extrapolate current results or comment on consumer spending since the vast majority of its holiday selling had not yet happened. Tiffany still raised its fiscal 2007 earnings forecast. It now expects to earn $2.69 to $2.74 a share from continuing operations, including the gain from the Tokyo flagship sale. It had previously forecast earnings of $2.64 to $2.69 per share. The company also increased its full-year sales growth forecast by 1 percentage point to 15 percent. More mid-tier jewelers like Zale Corp ( ZLC.N ), Finlay Enterprises Inc FNLY.O and Kay Jewelers' parent Signet Group Plc ( SIG.L ), have been less optimistic, as their core mid- and lower-income consumers are most hit by economic worries. STRONG SALES Net income rose to $98.9 million, or 71 cents a share, in the fiscal third quarter ended October 31, from $29.1 million, or 21 cents, a year earlier. Excluding an after-tax gain of 48 cents from the sale of its Tokyo store, and a 4 cent charge tied to a donation to the Tiffany Foundation, the company earned 27 cents a share, beating analysts' estimates of 25 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales jumped 18 percent to $627.3 million, also topping Wall Street's average expectation of $618.3 million. International sales also advanced 18 percent, on a constant currency basis, helped by growth in most markets including Japan, which had previously faced declining sales. U.S. retail revenue was up 12 percent, as sales in its New York flagship store rose 25 percent. More than half that increase came from higher sales to tourists, a company spokesman said during a conference call. Same-store sales rose 8 percent in U.S. stores. Revenue from its London stores was also "very strong," the spokesman said. "These rates of growth are in line with our central scenario of a 'gradual slowdown' of the luxury industry," HSBC analyst Antoine Belge wrote in a note. In October, Tiffany announced plans for smaller stores that will sell higher-margin and more affordable products, in a move to cater to more middle income customers. The new store format could boost U.S. sales in the long run, Kowalski has said. Tiffany shares were down 2.3 percent at $47.62 after rising to $51.08 earlier on the New York Stock Exchange. The decline could signal investors' concern that Wall Street bonuses could be lower this year and affect holiday sales, Stifel Nicolaus analyst David Schick said. Tiffany shares trade at about 19 times the next year's earnings estimates on the Dow Jones U.S. Specialty Retailers Index .DJUSRS. (Editing by  Derek Caney , Phil Berlowitz)
