 TALLAHASSEE, Florida  (Reuters) - Facing a run by panicked local government investors, Florida officials on Thursday suspended withdrawals from a state-run, short-term investment fund that has shrunk to $15 billion from $26 billion over the past two weeks. 

 By unanimous vote, a three-member panel led by Florida Gov. Charlie Crist ordered state financial managers to temporarily shut down the fund used by local governments and school districts. The fund operates much like a money market account. Meeting in an emergency session, the State Board of Administration suspended withdrawals from the Local Government Investment Pool, which has been rocked by uncertainty over the national subprime mortgage crisis. The decision came after panelists were told that another $3.5 billion in withdrawals had been made on Thursday morning, leaving the fund with about $15 billion in assets as of 11 a.m. EST (1600 GMT). The panel plans to meet again on Tuesday to consider more long-term remedies. By its decision, the panel rejected a recommendation from the fund's top financial manager to use the $137 billion Florida retirement pension fund to provide collateral for about $1 billion in Local Government Investment Pool investments that have been downgraded in recent weeks. "We need to stop the bleeding now," Crist said. State financiers countered that the investments continue to pay principal and interest and the underlying collateral -- single family mortgages from credit-worthy homeowners -- remain sound. "If we don't do something quickly, we will not have an investment pool," said Coleman Stipanovich, the State Board of Administration's executive director, speaking in favor of using retirement funds to shore up the pool. Local government and school district officials said the freeze would cause some of the 1,000 investors to fail to make payroll and other immediate expenditures but there was no immediate confirmation of the effect on payrolls or other spending. One worry among municipal bond market participants is whether the investment pool holds funds for debt service payments and whether they will be available for local governments now that the state froze it. Standard & Poor's Ratings Services said in a statement it has not yet been able to get that information from state officials. Of the roughly $11 billion in net withdrawals from the fund, Orange County officials have pulled $370 million and the City of Pompano Beach withdrew $146 million. "The uncertainty of the magnitude of the subprime investments in the state's local government investment pool, coupled with less than adequate communication from the state, caused us to take the safe route and pull out," said Jim Moye, chief deputy comptroller for Orange County. "We got people who won't be able to make payroll tomorrow," said Wayne Blanton, executive director of the Florida School Boards Association. The freeze may cause cash-flow disruptions for local governments but is unlikely to lead to municipal bond defaults, Richard Larkin, municipal trading desk analyst at J.B. Hanauer & Co. in New Jersey, said in a report. He said the freeze is actually beneficial because it prevents the fire-sale of securities and preserves values of remaining investments in the pool. Withdrawals by local governments are reminiscent of the "run on the bank" that triggered a fire sale of securities by California's Orange County and led to the largest municipal bankruptcy in 1994. Nevertheless, Larkin said he did not expect any municipal bond defaults. (Additional reporting by Anastasija Johnson in New York; Editing by Leslie Adler)
