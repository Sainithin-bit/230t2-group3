 ASTANA  (Reuters) - Kazakhstan plans to introduce a new oil production tax to boost budget revenues, a senior official said on Friday, in a move certain to alarm foreign investors in the oil-rich Central Asian state. 

 Deputy Finance Minister Daulet Yergozhin said the tax, likely to come into force in 2009, will be based on output and world oil prices instead of on export volumes. It would also apply to companies working within production sharing agreements, he said. These have so far been exempt from the rent tax, introduced in 2004, which is also based on world prices but calculated on the basis of export volumes. "Everyone's reaction will be predictably negative," he told reporters in Astana. Kazakhstan, embroiled in a row with Western investors over delays and cost overruns at the Kashagan oilfield, has been increasingly assertive in its energy policy. It has made national security a key priority in its relations with foreign investors. Yergozhin said the Central Asian state's government would submit the draft for parliamentary approval in the first quarter of 2008 -- seen largely as a technical procedure since the lower chamber is controlled by pro-presidential loyalists. "We think that the introduction (of the new tax) would boost budget revenues and increase transparency," Yergozhin said, adding that the government believed the rent tax did not generate enough budget revenues. "(But) this should not scare investors," he said. Foreign investors have voiced concern about the business climate in Kazakhstan this year due to the country's row with the Eni-led ( ENI.MI ) group developing Kashagan, as well as separate subsoil law amendments that allow the government to unilaterally break contracts with oil companies. SERVICE CONTRACTS Most key oil projects in Kazakhstan are covered by production sharing agreements (PSAs) such as Kashagan and the Karachaganak deposit operated jointly by BG ( BG.L ) and Eni. "This tax would extend to all kinds of contracts and all taxpayers, regardless of earlier contracts," Yergozhin said. He said his ministry sought to abandon PSAs completely in the future and replace them with service contracts. "(Under these deals) the state would retain ownership of all resources and hire a company that would develop a field for monetary compensation," he said. Oil majors favor PSAs as they offer protection from changes in tax legislation and are tailored for individual projects. Kazakhstan, Central Asia's top oil producer, aims to triple its output within the next decade from the current 65 million tonnes a year. Some analysts believe Kazakhstan's leadership is not happy with a number of contracts signed in the 1990s when the nation, cash-strapped after the Soviet collapse in 1991, was keen to secure quick foreign investment to rebuild its economy.
