 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Jeweler Tiffany & Co ( TIF.N ) reported a sharp increase in third-quarter profit on Friday, driven by a gain from the sale of its Tokyo flagship store and higher international sales. Net income rose to $98.9 million, or 71 cents a share, in the quarter that ended Oct 31, compared with $29.1 million, or 21 cents a share, a year earlier. The company recorded a gain of 48 cents a share after taxes from the sale of its Tokyo flagship store, which it also leased back in the quarter.
