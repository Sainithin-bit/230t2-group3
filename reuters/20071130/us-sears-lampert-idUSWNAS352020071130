 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Sears Holdings Corp ( SHLD.O ) Chairman Eddie Lampert said on Friday that much of Wall Street and the media have underestimated the strength of the retailer and the progress it has made. 

 Lampert's defense of the company, in a letter to employees, came one day after Sears posted a 99 percent drop in earnings and a 3 percent drop in revenue for the third quarter. "We are one of the few retail companies that have actually reduced our overall debt levels while at the same time investing over $1 billion on capital expenditures, making investments in inventory for our customers, contributing significantly to our pension plans for our past and future retirees, and repurchasing over $3 billion of our shares," Lampert wrote in the letter, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
