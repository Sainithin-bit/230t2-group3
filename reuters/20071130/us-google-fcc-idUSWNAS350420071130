 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Google Inc said on Friday it will bid for coveted mobile airwaves in a move that could pit the Web search leader against U.S. wireless service providers. 

 The Silicon Valley-based company said it will submit a formal application with the U.S. Federal Communications Commission on Monday. Google's application to bid for the 700-megahertz wireless spectrum does not include any partners. (Reporting by  Kenneth Li )
