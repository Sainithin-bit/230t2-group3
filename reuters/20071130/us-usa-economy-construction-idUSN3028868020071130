 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Construction spending tumbled by a more-than-expected 0.8 percent, driven by a huge decline in private home building as the housing market crumbled further, a Commerce Department report on Friday showed. 

 Economists polled by Reuters before the report were expecting spending in October to fall by a much smaller 0.2 percent. October's decline to a $1.158 trillion seasonally adjusted annual rate -- the lowest rate in two years -- came after a revised 0.2 percent rise in September, first estimated as a 0.3 percent gain. Private home building fell 2 percent in October to $503.7 billion, a rate not seen in four years. It was the 20th straight monthly decline since a peak in home building in February 2006. Adding to the dismal picture, private nonresidential building fell 0.5 percent in October. It was the first decline since September of last year.
