 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Former General Motors Corp Chief Executive Roger Smith, who oversaw a sweeping reorganization at the largest U.S. automaker but was sharply criticized in the Michael Moore film "Roger & Me," has died after a brief illness. He was 82. 

 He died on Thursday in suburban Detroit, GM said on Friday, giving no more details. Smith was appointed chairman and CEO in January 1981 and led GM until July 1990. Despite Smith's efforts at technological advancement and more efficiency among brands, GM's share of the U.S. market fell from 46 percent to 35 percent in that period. Smith is also known for being the target of "Roger & Me," which documented the effects of GM's production cutbacks on Moore's hometown of Flint, Michigan, and started the documentary filmmaker's career as a populist gadfly. While CEO, Smith spent billions of dollars to create Saturn -- a new nameplate aimed at competing with Japanese models. He also acquired Electronic Data Systems and Hughes Aircraft Corp to automate GM's financial and manufacturing systems. GM has subsequently sold both companies. "Roger Smith led GM during a period of tremendous innovation in the industry," GM CEO Rick Wagoner said in a statement. "He was a leader who knew we had to accept change, understand change, and learn to make it work for us." Smith also formed a joint venture with Toyota Motor Corp, called New United Motor Manufacturing Incorporated or NUMMI, to build small cars in California. By 1990, GM's product lineup had overlapping vehicles tarnished with a reputation for poor quality, as Ford Motor Co, Chrysler and Japanese rivals began stealing market share. Smith invested heavily in robotics as GM began facing increasing foreign competition. But GM's U.S. market share has fallen steadily, and stood just below 25 percent in October. The automaker is in the middle of a restructuring of its North American operations by cutting more than 35,000 jobs and closing 12 plants. Prior to being elected chairman, Smith had been an executive vice president and a member of the GM board of directors since December 1974. He is survived by his wife of 53 years, Barbara, as well as two sons, Roger B. Smith and Drew J. Smith, and two daughters, Jennifer A. Ponski and Victoria B. Sawula. He had six grandchildren.
