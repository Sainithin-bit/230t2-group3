 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Defense contractor L-3 Communications Holdings Inc ( LLL.N ) posted a higher quarterly profit on Tuesday on demand for products that gather and monitor intelligence, but cut its full-year forecast in wake of a contract loss. 

 The company also said it expects an agreement with the U.S. Air Force that will allow a logistics unit to resume receiving federal contracts. The maker of explosive-detection devices and airport security scanners said net income was $227 million, or $1.95 a diluted share for the second quarter, compared with $223 million, or $1.90 a share, a year earlier. Excluding 9 cents tied to debt retirement and interest expense, profit was $2.04 a share. Analysts on average expected $1.93 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales rose 1 percent to nearly $4 billion, compared with $4.03 billion expected by analysts. L-3 said it now expects earnings of $8.05 to $8.25 for this year, compared with an April forecast calling for a profit of $8.13 to $8.33 a share. It cut its sales forecast to $16 billion to $16.1 billion from $16.2 billion to $16.3 billion previously. In June, the U.S. government awarded a contract worth up to $5 billion for logistics support to Lockheed Martin Corp ( LMT.N ) after the L-3 unit that was doing the work was suspended from receiving new federal contracts amid a criminal investigation [ID:nN21270116]. L-3 said the loss of that follow-on contract under the Special Operations Forces Support Activity (SOFSA) would shave $150 million from full-year sales and 4 cents from per-share profit. The company said on Tuesday that it expects an agreement with the Air Force under which the suspension of its Special Support Programs Division will be lifted.
