 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Consumer confidence fell in July to the lowest level since February, weighed mostly by worries about the job market, according to a private sector report released on Tuesday. 

 The Conference Board, an industry group, said its index of consumer attitudes fell to 50.4 in July from a revised 54.3 in June. The June reading was revised up from an original 52.9. The median of forecasts from analysts polled by Reuters had been for a July reading of 51.0. Forecasts ranged from 46.0 to 55.5. The expectations index declined to 66.6 from 72.7 in June. The present situation index declined to 26.1 from 26.8 in June. Consumers' assessment of the labor market worsened. The "jobs hard to get" index increased to 45.8 percent from 43.5 percent, while the "jobs plentiful" index was unchanged at 4.3 percent. (Reporting by  John Parry ; Editing by  Padraic Cassidy )
