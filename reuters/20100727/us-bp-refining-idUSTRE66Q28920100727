 LONDON  (Reuters) - BP Plc's profit from its refining and marketing operations tripled in the second quarter from a year earlier on Tuesday but the British oil major expects some decline in margins ahead. 

 BP made a replacement cost profit before interest and tax of $2.075 billion in the April-June period, compared with $680 million in the second quarter 2009 and $729 million in January-March this year. Overall, BP posted a loss of $17 billion in the second quarter after a $32.2 billion charge for the oil spill in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and confirmed that chief executive Tony Hayward would quit to be replaced by American Bob Dudley. The operation benefited from recovery in international refining margins and demand for petrochemical products in China. "In the second quarter the refining environment continued its recovery, following the 15-year low recorded for the global indicator margins in the fourth quarter of 2009," BP said in a statement. "In the international businesses, the petrochemicals business was able to capture the benefit of demand recovery, particularly in China, through high reliability and record sales volumes." Its U.S. refining operations returned to a profit of $757 million in the second quarter from losses in the first quarter and a year earlier. But the company said refining margins were likely to make a seasonal decline in the third quarter. Margins often dip during the transition from the peak summer demand to the heating season in the Northern Hemisphere. BP also said the contribution to refining and marketing operations from trading was weaker in the second quarter compared with the "particularly strong condition" a year earlier. Although the company did not detail why the trading conditions were weak in the second quarter, narrower contango in the oil market -- or premiums on longer dated contracts to the prompt -- has reduced the opportunities for many oil companies and traders to make profits from store oil now and sell it later. In general limited moves in price spreads between regions, such as the United States, Asia and Europe, have also capped physical arbitrage trading opportunities this year.
