 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - World stocks reached 2-1/2 month highs on Tuesday on strong corporate earnings, but weak U.S. consumer confidence limited stocks gains as well as a rally by the euro against the dollar. 

 Equity markets were also supported by global banking supervisors' plans to scale back proposals to beef up bank capital and liquidity rules. It was a relief to investors, who feared tough rules would hit the profitability of the financial sector. Investors began selling shares after a report showed U.S. consumer confidence fell in July to its lowest level since February as worries over the job market persisted. "It is certainly disappointing, we had some positive data late last year and early this year and it seems like momentum has faded a bit," said David Sloan, an economist at 4Cast Ltd., in New York. "Clearly the big problem for consumers is jobs." Corporate performance in the second quarter had eased concerns that the global economy might slow into year end as fiscal stimulus runs out and austerity programs hit consumer spending. The Dow Jones industrial average struggled to make its fourth consecutive winning session, rising 12.26 points at the close to 10,537.69. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX  slipped 1.17 points to 1,113.84 and the Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  fell 8.18 points to 2,288.25. The data clouded the economic outlook, which was supported on Tuesday by earnings from firms like Dow component DuPont and Co ( DD.N ), which reported second-quarter profit nearly tripled on strong sales in all five of its businesses. Two of Europe's top banks, UBS AG ( UBSN.VX )( UBS.N ) and Deutsche Bank AG ( DBKGn.DE )( DB.N ), also posted results that reassured investors following last week's regulatory stress tests. DuPont rose 3.6 percent to $40.38, while U.S.-traded shares of UBS jumped 8.9 percent to $16.50 and Deutsche Bank gained 2.8 percent to $68.06. There were signs corporate profitability could outshine lingering economic weakness. In the United States, 78 percent of the 175 companies in the benchmark S&P 500 index  .SPX  have reported earnings above analysts' expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data. "It has taken investors a bit to catch on to the sentiment that earnings are in fact pretty good," said Bruce Zaro, chief technical strategist at Delta Global Advisors in Boston, who contended that the rally's pause was not a bearish sign. The MSCI world equity index .MIWD00000PUS rose 0.19 percent to hit its highest level since May 14. The Thomson Reuters global stock index  .TRXFLDGLPU  was little changed. The FTSEurofirst 300 index  .FTEU3  rose 0.5 percent, and emerging stocks .MSCIEF added 0.64 percent, finding positive territory for the year. In currency trading, the euro struggled to hold its gains against the dollar but was trading up 0.07 percent at $1.3003, after earlier reaching 1.3045. The dollar gained against a basket of major trading-partner currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index .DXY rising 0.05 percent at 82.13. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar rose 1.22 percent to 87.94 yen. In bonds, U.S. Treasuries suffered amid equity strength but narrowed losses after the gloomy consumer confidence report. Benchmark 10-year Treasury note yields rose 0.05 percentage point to 3.05 percent. A report showed U.S. home prices rose more than expected in May, but some strength was due to a government tax-credit that has since expired, economists said. Risk premiums on some European debt were reduced as only seven of 91 of the region's banks failed health-check tests on their financial standing announced late last week -- five small Spanish banks, Germany's state-rescued Hypo Real Estate and Greece's ATEbank. No listed bank failed the tests. "As expected, the transparency has helped, with peripheral yield spreads versus Germany moving lower," Barclays Capital said in a note to clients. "It is interesting to note that this narrowing has been the most pronounced for Spain, the country with the largest number of 'failed' banks. We feel it is precisely this transparency that has helped the narrowing of the yield spreads." In commodities, U.S. light sweet crude oil fell $1.54, or 1.95 percent, to $77.44 per barrel, and spot gold declined $21.10, or 1.79 percent, to $1160.90 an ounce.
