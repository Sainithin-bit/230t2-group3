 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Yahoo Japan, Japan's biggest Internet portal operator, said on Tuesday it will adopt U.S. rival Google Inc's search engine and advertisement delivery system and provide Google with its data. 

 In contrast, partner Yahoo Inc has teamed up with Microsoft Corp in search technology. The deal will not affect the position of Yahoo Inc as the Japanese firm's strategic partner or Yahoo Inc's stake in Yahoo Japan, Yahoo Japan said in a statement. Yahoo Inc is Yahoo Japan's second-biggest shareholder after Softbank Corp. (Reporting by Yumiko Nishitani)
