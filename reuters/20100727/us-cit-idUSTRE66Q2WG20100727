 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - CIT Group ( CIT.N ), the commercial lender that last year emerged from bankruptcy, on Tuesday reported a quarterly profit that dwarfed analysts' estimates. 

 The commercial lender reported a second-quarter profit of $142.1 million, or 71 cents a share. Analysts on average expected a profit of 33 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Prior to the bankruptcy and a financial restructuring, CIT lost $1.68 billion, or $4.30 a share, in the year-earlier period. CIT said gains from asset sales and recoveries from written-off loans boosted its second-quarter profit, offsetting costs it reported related to an employee retention program and higher credit costs. The New York-based company said it completed the sale of its Australia and New Zealand vendor business in the quarter and it also sold about $580 million in student lending receivables. "We improved our funding flexibility, repaid higher cost debt, streamlined our portfolio and largely completed the build-out of our senior management team," Chief Executive John Thain said in the company's statement. Thain, previously the CEO of Merrill Lynch & Co and NYSE Euronext, became CEO of CIT in February. CIT shares closed at $39.00 Monday on the New York Stock Exchange. CIT filed one of the five largest bankruptcies in U.S. history on November 1, 2009, and emerged on December 10.
