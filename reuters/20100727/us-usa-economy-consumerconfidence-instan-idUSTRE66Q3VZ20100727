 NEW YORK (Reuters) -Consumer confidence fell in July to the lowest level since February, weighed mostly by worries about the job market, according to a private sector report released on Tuesday. 

 KEY POINTS: * The Conference Board, an industry group, said its index of consumer attitudes fell to 50.4 in July from a revised 54.3 in June. * The June reading was revised up from an original 52.9. * The median of forecasts from analysts polled by Reuters had been for a July reading of 51.0. * The expectations index declined to 66.6 from 72.7 in June. * The present situation index declined to 26.1 from 26.8 in June. * The "jobs hard to get" index increased to 45.8 percent from 43.5 percent, while the "jobs plentiful" index was unchanged at 4.3 percent. COMMENTS: ZACH PANDL, U.S. ECONOMIST, NOMURA SECURITIES INTERNATIONAL, NEW YORK: "We've had a clear decline in confidence over the last two months but it's not yet severe enough to signal an imminent recession. "It does look like consumers are getting a bit nervous about growth and that we will see some relatively soft GDP figures in the near future but confidence hasn't collapsed abruptly so we think this is a soft patch in growth and not a recession." DAN COOK, SENIOR MARKET ANALYST, IG MARKETS, CHICAGO: "Obviously slipped a bit more than expected, really kind of a sign of the times. We got a pretty good report out of the Case-Shiller, but it's hard for consumers to be pretty confident when most of them can read and see the papers and see what the jobless situation is. The labor market is still going to weigh on consumer confidence because nobody is overly optimistic right now about the future." KATHY LIEN, DIRECTOR, CURRENCY RESEARCH, GFT FOREX, NEW YORK: "We have a little bit of a rally in the dollar after this number because even though consumer confidence fell to a five month low there was an upward revision to the June data. However, I don't think traders should look to closely to that because the six month outlook and current conditions components both declined and the expectations of growth in the economy are at the softest since February. This number just reinforces the central bank's concerns but it was not the buzz kill the market had feared." JACK ABLIN, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, HARRIS PRIVATE BANK, CHICAGO: "In this environment, no surprise is good news given that everyone is looking out for the next pitfall. I think a meet is as good as a beat, and anything under expectations likely won't be seen as good news. The whole recovery hinges on jobs and spending and there's no catalyst there. I don't think there's anything the government can do that will bring the unemployment rate down. We're still in the early stages of a very slow recovery." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stocks add to gains after consumer confidence data. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices add to losses. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar little changed after data.
