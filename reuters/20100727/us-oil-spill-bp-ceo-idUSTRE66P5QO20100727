 LONDON  (Reuters) - BP said it had no plans to issue a statement about a board meeting on Monday which sources close to the company said discussed whether to confirm a plan to ditch Chief Executive Tony Hayward. 

 BP's board was due to confirm a plan to replace Hayward with Bob Dudley, who is currently heading BP's oil spill response, sources close to the company said. BP is due to issue its second quarter results on Tuesday at 0600 GMT/2 a.m. EDT. (Reporting by  Tom Bergin , Editing by Sandra Maler)
