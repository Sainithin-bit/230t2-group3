 (Reuters) - U.S. car sharing company Zipcar is planning to launch a initial public offering of its shares next year, the New York Post reported. 

 Zipcar Chief Executive Scott Griffith told the paper that the offering was yet to be priced and also said he expected the company's sales of $120 million this year to rise to $1 billion within a decade. "We're succeeding and we're growing in a year where flat is the new up," the paper quoted Griffith as saying. Reuters could not immediately reach Zipcar for comments outside regular business hours. Zipcar sells its services in the United States and Britain. (Reporting by  Esha Dey  in Bangalore; Editing by Jon Loades-Carter)
