 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Treasury Department issued rules on Wednesday that would limit bonuses paid to senior executives of financial firms that received emergency government assistance. 

 For firms that received more than $500 million in government aid under the Treasury Department's Troubled Asset Relief Program, the five senior executives and the 20 most highly paid executives would be covered under the constraints. (Reporting by Washington Treasury team)
