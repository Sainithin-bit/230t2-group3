 LONDON  (Reuters) - U.S. aircraft maker Boeing ( BA.N ) has slashed its forecasts for new plane demand in the wake of the industry downturn, and said it was currently focused on delivering existing orders rather than chasing new ones. 

 The company said in a Thursday report it expected 29,000 new planes to be ordered world-wide over the next two decades, down from 29,400 forecast a year ago. It said the overall value of the new orders would be $3.2 trillion -- the same figure as last year. The forecast reflects the current slump in air travel, but also assumes a recovery over the longer term. "The market is difficult today, but we do see it starting to stabilize," Randy Tinseth, Vice President for Marketing at Boeing's commercial planes division, told reporters. He added that the firm was currently striving to make sure current orders were delivered and to avoid cancellations, rather than winning new orders. "Any time you go into a downturn it's about getting the backlog in place, rather than acquiring new orders," he said. (Reporting by  John Bowker , Editing by Kate Holton)
