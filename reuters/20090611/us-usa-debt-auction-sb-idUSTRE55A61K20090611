 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Demand was well above average in an auction of $11 billion of reopened 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds on Thursday, assuaging some fears of a waning global appetite for a deluge of U.S. government debt. 

 The auction was the first for the long bond since questions over U.S. credit-worthiness surfaced after Standard & Poor's last month revised Britain's credit outlook to "negative," but those concerns did not appear to impact demand in Thursday's sale. The bid-to-cover ratio, a gauge of demand, was 2.68, well above an average of 2.39 in the previous three 30-year reopening auctions. Indirect bidders, including foreign central banks, took home about 49 percent of the offered bonds, which was the highest since the auction that reintroduced the maturity in February 2006, and compares with an average of about 26 percent participation by indirect bidders in the previous three 30-year reopening auctions. "It was very well bid," said Lou Brien, market strategist at DRW Trading in Chicago. Both U.S. bonds and stocks extended their price rally after the auction results. Bond yields, which move inversely to prices, have generally been climbing since December amid some fears of longer-term inflation and signs of an improving economy. Some analysts said the bond yield may have gained enough that investors could not resist scooping up the 30-years at current prices. "The long rates have backed up about 100 basis points in the last month or so -- after that backing up you will draw in some lurking buyers who wanted to get issues on the cheap," said Leonard Santow, managing director at Griggs & Santow in New York. The high yield in the auction was 4.72 percent, nearly half a percentage point above the high yield of 4.29 percent in the original sale of the bonds last month. Pension funds looking for high rates were likely big buyers in the auction, analysts said. "They need to grab yield, so they probably played a huge role today," said Bret Barker, portfolio manager at Metropolitan West Asset Management in Los Angeles. The auction was the third and final sale of a total of $65 billion of Treasury coupons this week. A sale of $35 billion of three-year notes on Tuesday also met solid demand, while an auction of $19 billion in 10-year notes on Wednesday was deemed to be less than a success after the government had to pay a premium to get the bonds sold. Worries over a lack of demand for U.S. debt were compounded this week after Russia pledged to cut the share of U.S. Treasuries in its $400 billion reserves and instead buy bonds issued by the International Monetary Fund and up the share of reserves held in foreign bank deposits.
