 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEHMQ.PK is being sued by two former clients for more than $190 million, alleging the failed bank deceived them about the market for auction-rate debt. 

 Western Digital Corp WDC.N and Ceradyne Inc CRDN.O filed the suits on Tuesday in Lehman's bankruptcy case, claiming to have "suffered a devastating financial impact induced by (Lehman's) deceptive sales practices with respect to auction-rate securities, a supposedly liquid financial product." The companies allege that Lehman knew, but failed to inform them, that the securities were "not supported by a broad, fully-functioning market." Lehman spokeswoman Kimberly Macleod declined to comment. A spokesman for Lake Forest, California-based Western Digital also had no comment, and a spokesman for Costa Mesa, California-based Ceradyne could not immediately be reached. The firms are seeking to recoup funds they invested in asset-backed securities, as well as punitive damages. Auction-rate debt has rates that reset in periodic auctions, but some brokerages told investors the debt was as good as a cash substitute. When the market froze, many investors found themselves saddled with the debt. (Reporting by  Lilla Zuill , Editing by Ian Geoghegan)
