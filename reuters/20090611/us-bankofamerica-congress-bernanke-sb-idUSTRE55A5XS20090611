 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke told members of Congress in April that he did not pressure officials at Bank of America to withhold information about possible problems with its merger with Merrill Lynch, according to a letter released on Thursday. 

 "The Federal Reserve acted with the highest integrity throughout its discussions with Bank of America regarding Bank of America's acquisition of Merrill Lynch," Bernanke wrote in an April 30 letter to Representative Dennis Kucinich. (Reporting by  Mark Felsenthal )
