 (Reuters) - Jefferies raised its price target on Google Inc's ( GOOG.O ) stock to $695 from $600, while reiterating its buy rating, citing optimism among advertisers for fiscal 2010 amid improving macro environment. 

 "Our channel checks point to strengthening advertising, e-commerce environment and improving fiscal 2010 outlook, which bodes well for Google," analyst Youssef Squali wrote in a note. Online sales are up 3 percent from November 1 to December 6 of this year, supporting the prospect for a modestly positive growth in e-commerce this holiday season compared to a 3 percent drop last year, Squali said. "Google, with its ability to cost effectively drive traffic to e-tailers, stands to benefit disproportionately." Over 65 percent of online ad budgets continue to go to 'search', with Google claiming the lion's share, the analyst said. Commentary out of Yahoo ( YHOO.O ), AOL ( AOL.N ) and Value Click ( VCLK.O ) last week points to strengthening demand from advertisers, he added. Shares of the company were up nearly a percent at $595.42 in early morning trade on Nasdaq. (Reporting by Mansi Dutta in Bangalore; Editing by Anil D'Silva)
