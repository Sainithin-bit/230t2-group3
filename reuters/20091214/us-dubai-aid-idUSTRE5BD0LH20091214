 DUBAI  (Reuters) - Dubai will consider selling assets after receiving $10 billion in bailout funds from Abu Dhabi but the funds were provided to Dubai without conditions attached, a source close to the Dubai government said on Monday. 

 Dubai said it had received $10 billion from fellow UAE member Abu Dhabi to help it repay a $4.1 billion Islamic bond maturing on Monday. "You have two partners who are going to act like partners to help each other in general and to help the UAE," said the source, who declined to be named, in a conference call with journalists.
