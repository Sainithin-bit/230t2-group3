 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Citigroup plans a complicated, multi-stage transaction to remove itself from the Troubled Asset Relief Program. 

 Below is the bank's plan to exit TARP. Citi plans to issue these securities: - $17 billion of common stock to be sold immediately - $3.5 billion of mandatory convertible securities to be sold immediately. The securities will turn into stock in three years. - $1.7 billion of common stock equivalents granted to employees in January 2010. The instruments will turn into common stock pending shareholder approval at the company's annual meeting on April 1. - The bank may also issue up to $3 billion of trust preferred securities in the first quarter. The government plans to: - Sell up to $5 billion of the roughly $30 billion of Citigroup shares it owns, alongside the bank's $17 billion issuance - Sell its remaining shares over the next six to 12 months - Cancel the guarantee against excessive losses it has on a $250 billion portfolio of Citigroup assets. - Allow the bank to cancel about $1.8 billion of the $7.1 billion of trust preferred securities that Citigroup issued to the United States as a fee for the guarantee.
