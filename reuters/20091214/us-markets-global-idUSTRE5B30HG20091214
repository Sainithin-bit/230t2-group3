 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks surged to fresh closing highs for 2009 and the euro gained against the U.S. dollar on Monday after Abu Dhabi's $10 billion in aid to help Dubai avoid a default boosted appetite for riskier assets. 

 The dollar slipped after Dubai's bailout eased fears of a potential debt default that had rattled markets and lifted the U.S. currency last week on a flight to safety bid. Gold advanced moderately and copper prices firmed on the news, while most U.S. Treasury debt prices fell on a reduced safe-haven buying of bonds. Oil, meanwhile, slid for the ninth consecutive day as weak fuel demand overshadowed stock gains and the weaker dollar. The Dow industrials and Standard & Poor's 500 Index ended the day at 14-month closing highs, while the Nasdaq finished at a 15-month closing high. Stocks were also propelled by Exxon Mobil Corp's ( XOM.N ) $30 billion takeover bid for natural gas supplier XTO Energy Inc XTO.N and plans by Citigroup Inc ( C.N ) to repay the U.S. government about $20 billion in bailout funds. But lingering worry over debt woes elsewhere capped euro gains and investors were cautious ahead of a meeting of Federal Reserve policy-makers this week that may provide clues about how the Fed -- the U.S. central bank -- intends to exit its current ultra-loose monetary policy. "Abu Dhabi helped risk-taking overnight and that hurt the dollar, but we're at an interesting point heading into the Fed meeting," said Dan Cook, senior analyst at IG Markets in Chicago. "(Fed Chairman Ben) Bernanke has said rates will stay low, but people are starting to think the Fed at some point will have to consider raising them," Cook said. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  closed up 29.55 points, or 0.28 percent, at 10,501.05. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  gained 7.70 points, or 0.70 percent, at 1,114.11. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  climbed 21.79 points, or 0.99 percent, at 2,212.10. Oil pared losses after the Dubai news but settled lower. Oil prices have fallen more than $8 a barrel this month in the longest price slide since July 2001 as rising U.S. inventory levels show a sluggish recovery in demand. Crude for January delivery fell 36 cents to settle at $69.51 a barrel. Brent crude traded up 1 cent to settle at $71.89 a barrel. "The fundamentals of oil demand are weak, and as the year comes to an end, people have been paying more attention to them," said Gene McGillian, analyst at Tradition Energy in Connecticut. "After falling so much, the market is trying to stem the slide but it hasn't really happened yet." The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note traded at break-even and was priced to yield 3.55 percent in light trade, absent any major economic data and caution before the Fed meeting. "There doesn't seem to be anything going on today," said Lee Olver, fixed income strategist at SMH Capital in Houston. The dollar was down against a basket of major currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index .DXY down 0.33 percent at 76.322. The euro was up 0.22 percent at $1.4653, and against the yen, the dollar was down 0.52 percent at 88.59 yen. U.S. gold futures for February delivery in New York finished $3.90 higher at $1,123.80 an ounce. " The dollar decline helped stem the selling pressure. But the jury is still out on where the next near-term move will be for gold. For now, it's nap time," said George Nickas, a metals broker at FC Stone in New York. European shares rose for a third straight session to hit a one-week closing high, with regional financial shares advancing after Dubai said it had received funding to help repay $4.1 billion in an Islamic bond maturing on Monday. In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of top regional shares ended 0.8 percent higher at 1,018.29. The inter-bank cost of borrowing dollars and euros held near record lows as the market prepared for the Fed's statement on interest rates and the final chance to get cheap one-year money from the European Central Bank. The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS reversed course following the Dubai announcement to gain 0.4 percent. In Tokyo, Nikkei average  .N225  erased earlier losses to end flat. (Reporting by  Angela Moon ,  Edward McAllister ,  Steven C.
