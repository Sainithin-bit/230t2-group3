 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The British hacking scandal may be unfortunate but the closing of the News of the World and the outcome of dealings with broadcaster BSkyB ( BSY.L ) will have a minimal impact on News Corp's ( NWSA.O ) revenue stream, a major shareholder said on Monday. 

 "News Corp may really tank business wise, but I wouldn't put a high probability on it," said Donald Yachtman, chief investment officer of Yachtman Asset Management Co of Austin, Texas, the ninth-largest shareholder in News Corp. "The market has a central tendency to overact," Yachtman said. "It does slightly reduce the predictability of the cash flows, but the impact on the cash flows is minimal at best." Yachtman said News Corp shares are still undervalued. Its shares were down over 7 percent in U.S. trading on Monday, and are off about 14 percent over the past four days.
