 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Euro zone finance ministers will discuss the possibility of buying back Greek debt or the private sector swapping holdings for longer-dated maturities during talks on Monday, a senior EU source said on Monday. 

 His comments suggest that a French plan that would have involved private sector creditors rolling over around 70 percent of their Greek debt into 30-year bonds and other AAA-rated securities is now off the table. "The Eurogroup tonight won't be reaching any conclusions, the draft conclusions as they stand right now insist that the technical groups will be asked to work on the two solutions -- bond buybacks and debt rollover, in order to reach a solution by the end of July," the source said. "There is a strong possibility that a new Eurogroup meeting will be called at the end of July, to sign off on the solutions." The official said some member states were pointing out that Greece would soon be reaching the threshold of 160 percent of debt to GDP and that something should be done quickly reduce the pressure on the country.
