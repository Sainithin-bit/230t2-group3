 TOKYO  (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan is expected to hold off on easing monetary policy further and revise up its assessment of the economy at a policy meeting that ends on Tuesday, encouraged by a pickup in factory output and recovery in business sentiment hit by the March 11 earthquake. 

 Following are recent key quotes by BOJ and government officials on monetary policy and the economy. FINANCE MINISTER YOSHIHIKO NODA, July 5, in regular news conference With a $25 billion extra budget for disaster relief "we aim to ensure steps toward restoration and pave the way for reconstruction". He warned that by September the government would struggle to stick to its spending plans if a bill authorizing debt issuance was not passed in the parliament session that runs until the end of August. BOJ GOVERNOR MASAAKI SHIRAKAWA, July 4, in speech "The global economy continues to recover albeit at a slower pace ... "Japan's economy will likely resume a moderate recovery as supply constraints ease further and output activity picks up." NODA, July 1, in interview "What we must bear in mind is that the biggest problems are currency and electricity rates. We must prevent these problems from causing an outflow of companies abroad ... "I will take decisive steps against disorderly currency moves and excessive fluctuations again, although the decision would not be based on certain levels. NEW BOJ BOARD MEMBER KOJI ISHIDA, June 30, in news conference "Compared with what I saw early this year, uncertainty has grown regarding overseas economies. There is a cloud hanging over them ... "But even with such a slowdown, as long as overseas economies continue to grow at a faster pace than Japan, they would have a positive impact on Japan." SHIRAKAWA, June 27, in speech in the Netherlands He said earthquakes and financial crises are events that rarely happen but when they do they can have a huge impact on the economy. But the latter have occurred "more frequently than would be assumed in a normal probability distribution". "Before the Lehman shock, the prevailing view among academics and the authorities was that aggressive easing after the bursting of bubbles could prevent a serious economic downturn ... In the end, the Lehman shock crushed this optimistic view." BOARD MEMBER YOSHIHISA MORIMOTO, June 23, in speech and news conference "Risks from the global economy seem to be larger than before. "A lot of recent U.S. economic data fell short of forecasts and cautious views are spreading about the U.S. economy ... But this is likely to ease to a certain degree over time, and with U.S. monetary policy remaining easy, growth is likely to resume." "Our initial expectation was for supply constraints (in Japan) to ease in the autumn and beyond but we now expect those constraints to be fully resolved around autumn, while production is highly likely to recover to pre-quake levels in July-September." ECONOMICS MINISTER KAORU YOSANO, June 20, in news conference "There is talk of considerable sovereign risks for Greece and other European countries. Europe is an export destination for Japan but has sources of uncertainty ... We need to recognize that performances of overseas economies are risk factors for Japan." SHIRAKAWA, June 14, in news conference "We were thinking somewhat brightly when we issued our outlook report (in April), but compared with our forecast, we have seen positive surprises in the past month. There have been positive surprises in the near term, but sources of concern are emerging when looking at the medium to long term." (Reporting by Rie Ishiguro; Editing by  Michael Watson )
