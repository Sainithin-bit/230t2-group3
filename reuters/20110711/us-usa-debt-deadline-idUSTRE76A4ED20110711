 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Monday said he expects to have a deal to raise the debt ceiling by an August 2 deadline but noted that there is "a lot of work" to get Democrats on board as well as Republicans. 

 "We are going to get this done by Aug 2," Obama told a White House news conference. "These things are a tough process," he added. "The point is that if everybody gets in the boat at the same time, it doesn't tip over." (Editing by  Sandra Maler )
