 LONDON  (Reuters) - News Corp head Rupert Murdoch should drop his plans to take full control of pay TV operator BSkyB, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said on Monday. 

 "Do the decent and sensible thing, and reconsider, think again about your bid for BSkyB," Clegg told BBC News after meeting representatives of victims of phone hacking by News Corp's News of the World newspaper. (Reporting by  Keith Weir ; Editing by  Tim Castle )
