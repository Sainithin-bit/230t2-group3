 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Monday said he would include Social Security in a deficit reduction deal only to extend the program's life for future retirees, not to help close the budget shortfall. 

 "Social security is not the source of our deficit problems," Obama told a White House press conference. "The reason we do Social Security is to strengthen Social Security to make sure those benefits are there for seniors in the out years." (Editing by  Sandra Maler )
