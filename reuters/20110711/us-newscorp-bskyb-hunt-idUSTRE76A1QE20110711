 LONDON  (Reuters) - British regulators asked to reassess News Corp's bid to take over BSkyB will take as long as is necessary and have not been given a timetable, Media Secretary Jeremy Hunt said on Monday. 

 Britain has asked for fresh regulatory advice over the bid by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp to buy out BSkyB, signaling it could be looking for a way out of having to approve the deal while a damaging phone hacking scandal is raging. "We're not going to give them a time limit as to when they have to respond," he said in a television interview. "They need to take as long as they take. We need to take a measured approach to a very difficult decision." Shares in BSkyB have plunged in the last few days on fears the government would either block or severely delay the takeover following damning allegations about the conduct of journalists at one of Murdoch's tabloid newspapers.
