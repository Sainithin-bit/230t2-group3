 Bangalore  (Reuters) - Auto parts maker TRW Automotive Holdings Corp ( TRW.N ) said it received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice regarding an antitrust investigation. 

 The company, which is valued at about $6.9 billion, said it cannot estimate the financial impact resulting from this. TRW said on June 7 the European antitrust authorities had visited some of its locations in Germany to obtain information in connection with an anti-competitive investigation in the European Union. A related request was made in the United States. The Livonia, Michigan-based TRW said it is fully co-operating with the competition authorities. Shares of TRW, which closed at $55.85 on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, were down 2 percent in premarket trade on Monday. (Reporting by  Fareha Khan  in Bangalore; Editing by Don Sebastian)
