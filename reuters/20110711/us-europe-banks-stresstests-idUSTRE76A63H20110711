 LONDON  (Reuters) - This year's health check of Europe's banks will provide "unprecedented" new insight about the industry that will be useful in a time of market turmoil, the head of the regulator overseeing the test said on Monday. 

 "We are still in a very fragile area," Andrea Enria, chairman of the European Banking Authority (EBA), said in regard to current market conditions. He said the EBA will for the first time look at confidential data and challenge it, before releasing it for supervisors and investors to assess. "We will put an unprecedented amount of data out there," Enria said. There had been calls from some countries, including Germany, to limit the amount of data that is disclosed. In a letter to the EBA obtained by Reuters, German banking association ZKA (Zentraler Kreditausschuss), which represents the five associations of German banks, warned that "should publication take place in the envisaged form, we fear that it will not help in any way to build confidence or calm the markets -- on the contrary, quite the opposite is likely to occur." "Given the tense situation which already exists in money and capital markets, we believe publishing the results with the present level of detail would exacerbate the sovereign debt crisis," it added. The warning however seemed to have fallen on deaf ears. The templates on how much data would be disclosed had not been changed and the EBA had not replied to the letter, according to sources close to the association. The ZKA complained that publication would reveal "deep insight into a bank's business strategy, market positioning and risk profile on a hitherto unprecedented scale." It raised concerns that "the possibility cannot be excluded that publication of the stress test results in their present form will spark not only market volatility, but also targeted speculation against individual banks." The European Union watchdog is stress testing 91 lenders to see whether they can still stand on their own feet in the face of scenarios such as the economy shrinking for two consecutive years or big falls in house prices. The aim is to restore investor confidence in a sector still being propped up by taxpayers in parts and under pressure to contribute to a Greek bailout. The EBA planned to publish the results in June but had to ask banks to resubmit information because it was too optimistic. It also toughened up the impact of a big ratings downgrade on sovereign debt -- putting countries like Greece into theoretical default. Last year's test was judged a flop after only seven lenders failed, none of them from Ireland, even though Ireland's banks later had to be rescued by a bailout from the EU and International Monetary Fund.
