 VIENNA  (Reuters) - It is important to push for strict Greek financial discipline but a "positive and expansive element" in the spirit of a Marshall Plan would also be a good idea, European Central Bank policymaker Ewald Nowotny said. 

 Nowotny, who sits on the ECB's Governing Council, said a more balanced approach to helping Greece would have a greater chance of succeeding in the long-run. "On the one hand, it is of course important to push for strict discipline and for the keeping of promises in a country like Greece," Nowotny told an economic conference on Monday. "But looking at the tradition and experience of the Marshall Plan it is certainly sensible to have an expansive element, a positive element," he said. He did not give exact details but said that Greece had not used billions of euros in regional funds and this was something that could be changed. (Reporting by  Sylvia Westall ; editing by Ron Askew)
