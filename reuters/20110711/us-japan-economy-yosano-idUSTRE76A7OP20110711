 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's Economics Minister Kaoru Yosano said on Tuesday he is extremely worried about the European sovereign debt crisis that is spreading from Greece to Ireland, Portugal and Spain. 

 Yosano, speaking to reporters after a cabinet meeting, also said policy makers cannot forget that a sovereign default could easily impact other economies across the globe. (Reporting by Stanley White; Editing by Edmund Klamann)
