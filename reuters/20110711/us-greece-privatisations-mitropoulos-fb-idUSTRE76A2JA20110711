 (Reuters) - Greece on Monday named Eurobank Equities executive Costas Mitropoulos as the chief of its privatizations agency which will run billions of euros in asset sales to help pay down public debt. 

 Here are some facts about Mitropolous: * Mitropoulos, 55, headed management consulting firm Kantor until 2008 when he was picked to head Eurobank Equities, the investment arm of Greece's second-largest lender. * He has an MBA from Imperial College in London and a PhD from the London Business School. * In his letter to parliament's president, which has to give an opinion on the appointment, Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said Mitropoulos, who was also deputy head of the British-Hellenic chamber of commerce, will bring experience in project and portfolio management. * People who have worked with him describe him as results- oriented, structured and on the ball, focused on the bottom line. * Mitropoulos founded KANTOR Management Consultants, a leading consultancy in Greece and up to 2008 was its executive board chairman. * He had previously worked as a management consultant with Coopers & Lybrand in the UK, Africa and Western Europe in energy, transport, telecoms and financial services. He has been responsible for many privatizations and corporate restructuring projects. * Mitropoulos has a mechanical and electrical engineering degree from the National Technical University of Athens. * He once wrote in a column: "So what is it that makes Greece a country where success does not breed success? One reason is that business is not driven by the idea of investing for long-term returns. An old-fashioned merchant spirit survives, based on making short-term gain ... "It is clear that Greece has the capacity to reach the next level. However, in order to create a future that will differ significantly from the past, we need a unifying and compelling vision."
