 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Following are profiles of the Bank of Japan's policy board members, including one newcomer who hails from the banking industry: 

 MASAAKI SHIRAKAWA, 61, governor A career central banker who took the helm in 2008, Shirakawa led the implementation of unconventional steps including corporate debt buying during the global financial crisis and guided the BOJ out of the program as the recession ended. He led the board in reaching surprise decisions last year to set up an asset buying program to pump more money into an economy long mired in deflation and to peg rates virtually at zero until price stability is in sight. As the BOJ doubled the size of the asset buying scheme in its first response to the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, Shirakawa explained it was a pre-emptive action aimed at taking on more risk and preventing investors from fleeing risky assets. Shirakawa has said he sees some positive surprises for Japan's economy but has taken a slightly more cautious view on global growth as signs of a slowdown spread to emerging economies. HIROHIDE YAMAGUCHI, 60, deputy governor A central banker for more than 30 years, Yamaguchi was a BOJ executive director when he was appointed to his current post in October 2008. Yamaguchi, whose views are thought to be close to those of Shirakawa, has mostly toed the BOJ's official line on monetary policy. He is regarded as mainly in charge of communicating the BOJ's view to the government and ruling party lawmakers. Before the quake he expressed upbeat views on the economy and deflation, saying Japan is making progress toward an end to debilitating price falls while the economy will soon pull out of its torpor. KIYOHIKO NISHIMURA, 58, deputy governor A former professor at the University of Tokyo and a statistics expert, Nishimura joined the board in 2005 and was appointed a deputy governor in March 2008. He surprised markets with his proposal to expand the BOJ's asset purchases by 5 trillion yen ($62 billion) at the April 28 policy meeting. He was outvoted 8-1, and did not repeat the proposal at the May meeting. He nevertheless said at the May meeting the need for further monetary easing was potentially big but there was no great merit in boosting the asset-buying fund, according to minutes released last month. Previously, he had voted with the majority on policy decisions and mostly toed the bank's official line. HIDETOSHI KAMEZAKI, 68 Kamezaki, a former senior executive vice president of Japan's biggest trading firm, Mitsubishi Corp ( 8058.T ), joined the board in April 2007. He had broad overseas experience at the trading house. Before the quake he offered an upbeat take on the economy when he spoke in February, saying it would emerge from a lull toward the spring and was certain to pull out of deflation over time. In October 2008 he was among four dissenters when the BOJ cut rates to 0.3 percent, calling instead for a cut to 0.25 percent. He has voted with the board and toed the BOJ's official line since then. SEIJI NAKAMURA, 69 Nakamura, who joined the board in April 2007, was formerly head of a unit of Japanese ocean freight firm Mitsui O.S.K. Lines ( 9104.T ). He worked mostly in its finance and planning sections. Nakamura was upbeat about the economy's outlook last month when he said global growth would help Japan's recovery accelerate later this year, unfazed by signs of a slowdown in global factory growth. He was cautious about expanding the central bank's loan scheme targeting growth industries, though the BOJ decided two weeks later to add a 500 billion yen credit line to the scheme to help banks that extend asset-based lending. He dissented when the BOJ cut rates to 0.3 percent in October 2008, favoring instead a cut to 0.25 percent. He has followed the BOJ's official line since then. RYUZO MIYAO, 47 An academic and expert on monetary policy, Miyao joined the board in March last year. He is known for his research on inflation targeting and some analysts say he doubts the effectiveness of such a policy. Miyao said in September that an increase in the BOJ's outright buying of Japanese government bonds was one policy option and that assessments of quantitative easing now could be different than in the past. Following the earthquake and tsunami, Miyao said on March 23 that the BOJ would take appropriate policy action if necessary, but offered few clues on what specific action was being considered. YOSHIHISA MORIMOTO, 67 Morimoto, a former executive at Tokyo Electric Power Co ( 9501.T ), Japan's biggest power utility and now at the center of the quake-triggered nuclear crisis, joined the board on July 1 last year. He has voted with the majority. Morimoto said last month that global economic risks have heightened somewhat after a slew of weak U.S. data but not enough to affect the outlook for Japan's economy. He also warned that a prolonged suspension of nuclear power plants across Japan would seriously hurt the economy. SAYURI SHIRAI, 48 Shirai, a former IMF economist, joined the board on April 1 as its only female member, taking a seat vacated by Miyako Suda, whose term expired in March. In her first media briefing Shirai ruled out the possibility of the BOJ underwriting government bonds to help finance reconstruction after the quake. Shirai, previously a professor of economics and policy at Tokyo's Keio University, also said the Japanese economy's outlook is very uncertain, with output and exports likely to decline for some time. Little is known about Shirai's views on monetary policy but analysts say she is unlikely to cause a stir, at least in the near term. KOJI ISHIDA, 64 Ishida, a veteran banker and a former leasing company head, joined the board on June 30, succeeding Tadao Noda, also a former bank executive. In his first news conference Ishida voiced caution over growing uncertainty surrounding overseas economies, suggesting he will side with the central bank's ultra-easy monetary bias to support Japan's fragile economic recovery. Little is known of Ishida's views on monetary policy, although analysts do not expect him to rock the boat in debates at rate-setting meetings at least in the near term.
