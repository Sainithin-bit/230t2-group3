 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Sharp Corp said on Monday its operating profit in the financial first half likely slipped 12.4 percent from a year earlier, falling short of market expectations, on tight supplies and higher prices of materials used to make solar cells. 

 Sharp, the world's No.1 maker of solar cells, said it estimated its operating profit totaled 79 billion yen ($690 million) in the six months to September, down from 90.17 billion yen a year earlier. That compares with a consensus forecast of 92.6 billion yen in a poll of five analysts by Reuters Estimates. Earnings were also hit by higher depreciation costs and startup costs for its liquid crystal display (LCD) TV plants overseas. Sharp stood by its operating profit forecast of 190 billion yen for the full year to March 2008, however, as production efficiency at its LCD TV plants in Poland and Mexico and silicon supplies for its solar cell business are both expected to improve. Senior Executive Vice President Hiroshi Saji said turmoil in the U.S. subprime mortgage loan market had little impact on unit sales of its LCD TVs, and it has no plans to change its target to sell 9 million LCD TV sets in the year to March. Sharp, the world's third-largest LCD TV maker after Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Sony Corp, will report its half-year earnings on Thursday. Prior to the announcement, shares in Sharp closed down 4.1 percent at 1,824 yen, underperforming the Tokyo stock market's electrical machinery index IELEC, which fell 2.3 percent. ($1=113.94 Yen)
