 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Financial market turbulence should have only a limited impact on euro zone growth, European Central Bank policymakers said at weekend meetings of global financial officials in Washington. 

 But they gave conflicting assessments of the inflation outlook, suggesting there is no consensus for any quick move to raise interest rates above 4 percent. ECB Executive Board member Juergen Stark said inflation risks had increased, echoing comments by Germany's Axel Weber. Belgium's Guy Quaden, however, said slower growth could have a downside impact on inflation, and Portugal's Vitor Constancio said the current acceleration was only due to technical factors. In an interview with Germany's Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Stark said the fundamentals of the European economy were strong and it should withstand the market upheavals. "So far there are many signs that the tensions on financial markets will have only a very limited negative impact on growth in the euro zone," he was quoted as saying. Quaden agreed, telling news agency Market News International on the fringes of International Monetary Fund meetings that "financial turbulences will have probably a negative impact, but also a limited one". However, he noted downside risks to growth in the 13-nation region and said this could have an impact on prices. "It cannot be excluded that some other elements -- in particular a moderate slowdown of the economy -- can exert a downside influence on inflation," Quaden said. Inflation has ticked up above the ECB's 2 percent ceiling and the ECB expects a further acceleration in coming months. Constancio said this was a statistical effect given oil prices were falling 12 months ago and are rising now. "Of course those are the rules of the game, but suffice to say that there is no acceleration of the inflation process," he told the Jornal de Negocios. But Stark backed comments by Weber and Greece's Nicholas Garganas that the price outlook had worsened, pointing to high energy and food prices and the tightening labor market. "The inflation danger has increased," he said. Weber told Reuters in a Friday interview that the ECB would not sit on its hands while the inflation outlook worsened. "We have to credibly communicate that we will not tolerate a long-term increase in inflation rates and that we are ready, if necessary, to counter such an increase with our monetary policy," he said on the fringes of Group of Seven meetings. NO AGREEMENT YET Other policymakers have avoided drawing conclusions yet, pointing to increased uncertainty and a need for more information. The ECB has kept rates on hold at 4 percent since June, after a squeeze on global credit markets in mid-August scotched a rate rise almost all analysts had expected for September. Now most analysts expect the ECB to keep rates on hold through 2008. Nout Wellink, who heads the Dutch central bank, told Reuters it would take time to put current credit strains to rest. "It's not over yet. I'm not saying the situation will deteriorate but it's a long process," he said in an interview in Washington. In an interview with Italy's Il Messaggero, ECB executive board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi offered no clear indication in what direction interest rates should move. "In this phase, monetary policy must create certainty and continue to be focused on the medium-term to guarantee price stability, as the ECB mandate says," he said. Stark was quoted as saying that more information was needed to build a clearer picture of the inflation outlook before any possible further increase in rates. ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet told a news briefing after the G7 meeting that the ECB had to remain "vigilant" in maintaining price stability, highlighting further increases in oil and commodities prices as a specific danger. Portugal's Constancio said the recent rise in the price of oil, a decline in the U.S. dollar and recent stock market falls were troubling. "These are not good indicators but we are only talking about days and it is therefore still not possible to draw big conclusions," he said.
