 MILAN  (Reuters) - The message of the recent Group of Seven meeting is for an appreciation of the yuan against the euro, following the Chinese currency's gains versus the dollar, a European Central Bank executive board member said. 

 "The yuan has gained 10 percent against the dollar in two years. The message of this G7 is that the yuan must now appreciate also against the euro," Lorenzo Bini Smaghi said in an interview with daily Il Messaggero published on Monday. Bini Smaghi also said Europe must learn to live with a strong euro and added that the strength of the currency is an "extraordinary opportunity" for euro area firms to boost their international role. He called on Europe to drastically limit its comments on the currency. "(ECB President Jean-Claude) Trichet and (euro group chair Jean-Claude) Juncker should be the only one talking about the euro. Everything else is just making noise and does not help Europe's credibility." The ECB official said an upcoming EU mission to China would strengthen the euro zone's political role towards Bejing. Trichet, Juncker and European Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Joaquin Almunia plan a joint visit to China by the end of 2007. Bini Smaghi said this mission was important because so far the euro group "did not have a joint approach in bilateral relationships with China." Bini Smaghi added that last week's EU summit in Lisbon had strengthened the ECB's role by putting an end to a debate on whether to review the central bank's mandate to reduce its emphasis on inflation in favor of a greater focus on growth. "This position, which would have curtailed the ECB's independence, did not gain support."
