 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - The dollar slumped to a record low on Monday after a meeting of the finance chiefs of rich nations ended without words of support for the currency, while Wall Street weakness prompted a broad sell off in Asian stocks. 

 Oil slipped back from its record run on profit taking while gold fell as investors cashed in on its rally to a 28-year high on Friday. Traders said shares took their cue from Wall Street, which marked its biggest fall in two months on Friday, a slide made more unnerving as it marked the 20th anniversary of the 1987 stock market crash. Several Asian markets, including Tokyo, fell more than 2 percent in early trading. Investors dumped exporters, such as Canon Inc, on mounting worries about the U.S. economy and the dollar's weakness. Investors sold shares in favor of the relative safe-haven of government bonds, underlined by a fall in benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond yields to a one-month low. Investors are concerned a U.S. housing slump is spreading to other parts of the U.S. economy, Asia's top export market. Caterpillar, the worlds top maker of earth-moving construction and mining equipment, said on Friday several key U.S. industries that it serves were in recession. At 0129 GMT, Tokyo's Nikkei average had dropped 2.9 percent, while MSCI's measure of other stocks in Asia had fallen 1.8 percent. The MSCI index fell 0.9 percent last week, snapping eight straight weeks of gains. South Korea's key KOSPI dropped 3.7 percent and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 index shed 2.1 percent. "The U.S. market's tumble on a 'Black Monday' anniversary will unnerve local investors initially," said Kim Joong-hyun, a market analyst at Goodmorning Shinhan Securities. "But I don't think the impact would last long because markets have pretty much priced in the risk from the subprime crisis by now, and as the outlook for the local economy remains positive." The falling dollar makes exports from Asia relatively more expensive, a factor that undermined some of Japan's major exporters. Honda Motor, Canon Inc, Hyundai Motor, which fell 2 percent to 3 percent. Banks, which have been weighed by worries about a global credit squeeze, were also hit. Japan's top lender Mitsubishi UFJ dropped 2.3 percent and Australia's Macquarie Bank shed 4.4 percent. Adding to investors woes, energy stocks such as INPEX Holdings and oil-and-gas producer Woodside Petroleum were not spared after oil extended its decline from a record high set on Friday. U.S. crude fell 76 cents to $87.85 in early Asian session, down from a peak above $90 on Friday as investors booked profits from the recent rally. DOLLAR DOWN Traders sold the dollar after the tumble in U.S. stocks and following the G7's apparent indifference over the weakness of the currency. The finance ministers and central bank heads of the G7 countries met in Washington on Friday. "The G7's statement effectively gives a green light to continue selling the dollar," Michael Woolfolk, senior currency strategist at the Bank of New York Mellon, said over the weekend. The dollar hit a record low against a basket of major currencies. It carved out a six-week low near 113.20 yen, while the euro jumped to a record high of about $1.4350. The low-yielding yen tends to benefit from risk aversion because it is often used as the funding currency for high-yield investments. So when those are reversed, the investors buy back into the yen. "We didn't see any surprises from the G7, and weak stocks are continuing to drag on the dollar," said Hideaki Inoue, forex manager at Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking. But weakness in equities drove safe-haven Japanese government bonds (JGBs) higher. The yield on the benchmark 10-year JGBs fell 4 basis points to a one-month low of 1.56 percent. Spot gold took its cue from oil, falling on profit taking after it had reached a 28-year high on Friday. At 0120 GMT, it was trading at $756.90 an ounce.
