 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bear Stearns Cos Inc BSC.N Chairman Jimmy Cayne said on Monday his company's alliance with China's No. 1 brokerage, CITIC Securities Co, gives the U.S. investment bank a fast start on its transformation plan. 

 Cayne and Bear Stearns need to act fast to replace revenue lost to the disruption in the U.S. mortgage market. Bear, seen as a leader in packaging home loans into mortgage-backed bonds, has not expanded its revenue base outside the United States as quickly as some of its Wall Street peers. Earlier this month, Cayne and his senior executive team laid out a plan to transform its funding sources and balance sheet while bolstering its leadership ranks. Bear Stearns says it has plenty of cash and does not need a capital infusion. The company also is relying less on commercial paper and more on secured funding sources such as bank loans. It has named a number of new senior executives, including for asset management, European leveraged finance and mortgage-backed securities. Cayne said Bear Stearns' deal to swap stakes with CITIC ( 600030.SS ) shows the U.S. investment bank can find new sources of revenue amid an industrywide meltdown in fixed-income trading. "This is just an example. We moved the needle big, best case," Cayne told Reuters in a telephone interview. "If you thought about a partner in China, you couldn't hook up with a better entity than CITIC Securities." Analysts said the alliance -- which includes plans for CITIC and Bear Stearns to invest about $1 billion in each other -- could fill a big hole in Cayne's company. David Trone, an investment banking analyst at Fox-Pitt Kelton, said the deal gives Bear Stearns a shortcut to a huge footprint in China. "We believe this deal, if well executed, could be significant to Bear's medium- to long-term future, depending on the timing of Asian market conditions," Trone said. Sandler O'Neill analyst Jeff Harte said even with a shortcut, it will take time for Bear Stearns to get up to speed with rivals. International revenue accounts for about 24 percent of the company's total revenue. In contrast, Goldman Sachs Group Inc's ( GS.N ) international business accounted for 53 percent of its total revenue in the third quarter. Bear Stearns has been doing business in China since the early 1990s, but its impact there has been small. Since 2000, for example, it has been an adviser on only seven mergers and acquisitions totaling $1.64 billion in China and Hong Kong, according to research firm Dealogic. In a collaboration with CITIC, Cayne expects Bear Stearns' presence on M&A and new stock offerings to expand significantly. "We're certainly positioned to do that now," he said. Bear Stearns Chief Financial Officer Sam Molinaro said the bank will help CITIC with its goal of building a world-leading investment banking institution. "Our goal is to help them do that," Molinaro said. Molinaro and Cayne see a rapidly evolving fixed-income market in China, such as derivatives and listed options markets. China's market for packaging mortgages, auto loans and credit card receivables into securities for investors has not fully developed, Molinaro said. That is Bear Stearns' bread-and-butter business in the United States. The other key to the Bear Stearns-CITIC alliance is a joint venture that has the companies working together in Asian markets outside China. But even then, the link to China will be strong. "It's a tough place to gain a presence without substantial investment of people, and even then it is challenging," Molinaro said. "Putting together our businesses outside of China gives us entree and access to their client base in China. We think it will be a very powerful combination. One that nobody else has."
