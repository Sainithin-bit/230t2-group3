 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Kimberly-Clark Corp ( KMB.N ) on Monday posted a 24 percent increase in quarterly profit as the weaker dollar and strong sales volume in Huggies baby wipes and Kleenex tissue helped offset rising costs for pulp. 

 Third-quarter profit was $453.1 million, or $1.04 a share, compared with $364.2 million, or 79 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding restructuring charges and a gain for a legal settlement, earnings were $1.07 a share, compared with the $1.06 average analyst estimate compiled by Reuters Estimates. Like many consumer products companies, Kimberly-Clark has been trying to keep up with rising costs by increasing prices. The company announced a price increase earlier this month, but it will not take effect until early next year. The company has also been cutting costs and is looking for growth in developing and emerging markets. Sales rose 9.7 percent to $4.62 billion, topping the average analyst estimate of $4.51 billion compiled by Reuters Estimates. The weaker dollar, which raises the value of sales overseas for U.S. companies, added about 3 percent to sales, the company said. For the fourth quarter, the company forecast earnings or $1.09 to $1.11 a share, before one-time items. Analysts on average forecast $1.10 a share, according to Reuters Estimates.
