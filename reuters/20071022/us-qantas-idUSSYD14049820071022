 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Australia's Qantas Airways Ltd ( QAN.AX ) said on Monday it had ordered an additional 12 Bombardier Inc ( BBDb.TO ) Q400 aircraft in a A$400 million ($357 million) deal. 

 Qantas also said it had taken options and purchase rights for a further 24 of the 72-seat aircraft to be used on regional routes. Qantas last month suspended most flights using the Q400 planes after the Canadian government said they must be inspected. The fleet was put back in service shortly after no safety issues were found. Qantas, which has A$25 billion of new aircraft on order, said the new planes would be delivered from June 2008, bringing the number of Q400 planes on its regional air network to 21. "These aircraft will be used to increase capacity and service frequency on key regional routes, as well as pursue new growth opportunities," Chief Executive Geoff Dixon said in a statement. Bombardier, the world's third-largest maker of civil aircraft, in September asked airlines worldwide to ground 60 of its turboprop planes for inspections after landing gear failures forced two planes to make crash landings. Qantas shares were trading 2.7 percent weaker at A$5.67 at 0313 GMT, in a broader market down 2 percent. ($1=A$1.12)
