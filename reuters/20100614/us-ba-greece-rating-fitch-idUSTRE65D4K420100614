 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Fitch has no immediate plans to cut Greece's debt to junk, a senior analyst at the ratings firm said after Moody's cut the debt-choked country's debt to non-investment grade on Monday. 

 Asked if Fitch had plans to cut Greece's debt to junk, Fitch Ratings' senior analyst for Greece Chris Pryce said: "Not in the immediate future." "We've already said that unless there was a major, unforeseen development we would wait for the last months of the year to take a view on how successful the Greek government has been in implementing the agreed policies," Pryce told Reuters in a phone interview. "This is still our view. We feel comfortable having it on the edge of the investment grade." Fitch currently rates Greece at BBB-minus, the lowest investment-grade level, with a negative outlook, which implies more than 50 percent possibility of a donwngrade. Greece's credit rating was cut to junk by Moody's Investors Service on Monday, based on risks in the euro zone/IMF rescue package for the debt-laden country.
