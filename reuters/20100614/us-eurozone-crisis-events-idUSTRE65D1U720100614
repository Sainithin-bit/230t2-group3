 LONDON  (Reuters) - Here is a timeline of key events in the euro zone debt crisis since last November, when a new Greek government shocked markets by doubling estimates for Greece's 2009 budget deficit. 

 June 12 - Thousands of Germans protest against Berlin's austerity drive, adding to pressure on Chancellor Angela Merkel's increasingly unpopular coalition.

May 10 - Global policymakers install an emergency financial safety net worth 750 billion euros to bolster financial markets and shore up the euro against contagion from the Greek crisis.
