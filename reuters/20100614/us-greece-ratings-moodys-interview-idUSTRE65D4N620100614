 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Greece's credit ratings will depend on its economic growth, a senior Moody's analyst said on Monday after downgrading the country four notches into junk territory. 

 Austerity measures aimed at reducing Greece's debt can make it harder for the economy to grow but the government is also implementing measures to address structural and economic weaknesses, Moody's analyst Sarah Carlson told Reuters. "They can have a less pronounced impact on short-term growth, particularly if those structural measures kick in more quickly than it's expected," Carlson said in an interview. "The most important risk (for Greece's ratings) is the growth outlook," she added. Greece, with a debt load forecast to reach 149 percent of gross domestic product by 2013, is expected to see its economy slump by 4 percent this year after a 2 percent drop in 2009, as tax increases and cuts in wages and pensions take a toll. The government has insisted that Greece will not restructure its debt and will gradually recover after hitting the deepest point of its recession in 2010. "If they still need to take additional measures to reduce the debt because of slow growth, that would be a difficult political decision ... because obviously that entails still more sacrifice on the part of the population," Carlson said. She added, however, that the government seems to be "very determined" to implement the current set of austerity measures and structural reforms. Carlson also said Moody's still see a low probability of Greece's restructuring its debt. "The government can implement its measures and can come out of this period without needing to do a restructuring. We're not nearly as gloomy as others in the market," she said. Greece's credit rating was cut to Ba1, the highest speculative rating, from A3. With a stable outlook, the rating is expected to remain unchanged during the next 18 to 24 months, Moody's said.
