 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Paint maker Sherwin-Williams ( SHW.N ) reported lower second quarter profit on Thursday, weighed down by rising oil-based costs and the severe U.S. housing downturn that has hurt demand. 

 The maker of Krylon, Dutch Boy and Duron paints said earnings came to $171.7 million, or $1.45 a diluted share, from $202.6 million, or $1.52 a share, a year earlier. Sherwin forecast lower per-share earnings for the third quarter. (Reporting by  Karen Jacobs , editing by Dave Zimmerman)
