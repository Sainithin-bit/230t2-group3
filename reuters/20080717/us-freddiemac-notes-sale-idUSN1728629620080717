 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Freddie Mac FRE.N, the No. 2 U.S. home funding company which is under increased scrutiny for mortgage losses, on Thursday said it sold $3 billion in debt, supported by record central bank demand. 

 The yield spread premium on the notes versus two-year Treasury debt narrowed from 88 basis points to 86 basis points after the sale, due to a rebound in demand in the "federal agency" bond market and a price level cheap enough to ensure investor gains on their purchases, analysts said. Central banks, the most voracious buyers in the $3 trillion "federal agency" debt market, took 57 percent of the issue, Freddie Mac said. More than a third of the deal was purchased by investors -- including central banks -- in Asia, it said. Central-bank buying was "a little bigger than usual," said Timothy Bitsberger, treasurer of McLean, Virginia-based Freddie Mac, adding that overall, "everything here was consistent with what we have seen in the past" with debt issuance. Demand by central banks and other international investors is seen as a key barometer for the borrowing abilities of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae FNM.N, together which use more than $1.6 trillion in debt to finance purchases of U.S. mortgages. An attack on share prices last week over doubts of the companies' capital levels led to increased scrutiny of the debt sales. Bitsberger said his group took "very, very few incoming calls" from concerned investors during the stock slide. A plan announced on Sunday by the U.S. Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve to shore up the balance sheets and borrowing capabilities of Fannie and Freddie has helped firm investor confidence. Freddie Mac on Monday drew stronger-than-expected demand for a $3 billion short-term debt sale. Central banks added nearly $7 billion of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities to their portfolios in the week ended July 16, to a record $985.94 billion, according to the Federal Reserve, which holds the bonds in custody accounts. The central banks made $9 billion of purchases the week before, and have boosted their exposure to the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) from $832 billion at the end of 2007. While the companies through sharp stock drops never came close to losing access to the debt markets, some analysts had indicated that investors were growing edgy. Yield spreads on Freddie Mac debt had increased on Tuesday and Wednesday as investors unwound gains of Friday, when some assumed the companies would be taken over by the U.S. government. Agency yield spreads have been volatile since Friday, without a single driver. Some analysts said concern about the speed of Congressional approval of the Treasury's steps to backstop Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac damped demand. "Unlike most mega-bullets, which are syndicated to get the lowest possible yield, it's fair to conclude this week's was syndicated to produce a solid book in strong investor hands," Jim Vogel, a strategist at FTN Financial in Memphis, Tennessee, said in a note to clients. Barclays Capital, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co managed the Freddie Mac note sale. Shares of the GSEs surged for a second day on Thursday, with Freddie up 22 percent and Fannie rising 18.2 percent. Helped by gains in the financial sector, the stocks also rose after U.S. securities regulators issued an emergency rule on Tuesday to limit short selling in major companies, including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae lagged Treasury debt for a fourth consecutive day as rising market interest rates hurt their relative value. Fannie Mae MBS paying 6 percent interest yielded 1.89 percent in late trading, up from 1.86 percent on Thursday. (Additional reporting by Caryn Trokie; Editing by Leslie Adler)
