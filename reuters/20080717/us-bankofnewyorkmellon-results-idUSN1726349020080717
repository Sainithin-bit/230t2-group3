 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bank of New York Mellon Corp ( BK.N ) on Thursday said second-quarter profit fell 57 percent, hurt by a big charge related to the taxation of leases and by securities losses tied to the housing slump. 

 Results fell short of forecasts as asset management fees declined, as many investors cut back exposure to equities and favored safer, but lower-margin products such as money market funds. This offset higher fees from providing custodial and other back-office services to institutional investors. Bank of New York Mellon shares fell $3.26, or 8.5 percent, to $34.92 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, despite gains in many financial services stocks. In the fourth quarter since the merger of Bank of New York Co with Mellon Financial Corp created the world's largest trust bank, profit totaled $309 million, or 27 cents per share. A year earlier, earnings were $720 million for the combined banks and $445 million for Bank of New York alone. Excluding items, profit was 74 cents per share, 2 cents below the average analyst forecast, Reuters Estimates said. "They did very well on the custody side, but fees driven by asset market valuations were weaker than we would have thought," said Tom McCrohan, an analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia, who rates the bank "neutral." Results included a charge of $380 million, or 33 cents per share, related to leasing transactions, following an April court ruling involving North Carolina bank BB&T Corp ( BBT.N ). So-called "sale-in, lease-out," or "SILO," transactions were intended to transfer depreciation rights to companies from tax-exempt entities. The Internal Revenue Service has banned such transactions, but banks have argued they were legal at the time they entered into them. Bank of New York Mellon is in talks with the IRS. Wachovia Corp WB.N, the nation's fourth-largest bank, expects an $855 million charge over similar leases. Results also included $152 million of securities losses, reflecting what Chief Executive Robert Kelly called a "pretty brutally realistic assumption" of a further 17 percent drop in housing prices. At other custody banks reporting results this week, profit rose 50 percent at State Street Corp ( STT.N ) and 4 percent at Northern Trust Corp ( NTRS.O ). JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ), better known for retail and investment banking, on Thursday said profit fell 53 percent. RUSSIA LAWSUIT Bank of New York's $18.3 billion purchase of Mellon created a custodial power now handling $23 trillion of assets, and a large asset manager now overseeing $1.11 trillion. Quarterly revenue fell 3 percent to $3.4 billion, including the lease charge, below the average $3.83 billion forecast. Fee revenue rose 2 percent to $2.99 billion and net interest income fell 30 percent to $411 million. Expenses rose 4 percent. Fees from securities servicing rose 13 percent to $1.58 billion, while asset and wealth management fees fell 1 percent to $844 million. "People don't want to commit assets to longer-term categories such as equities and bonds," Kelly said in an interview. "Our money market products are growing enormously, but they have lower margins." Bank of New York Mellon still faces a $22.5 billion lawsuit by Russia related to a 2000 money-laundering case involving a former bank vice president. The case followed Bank of New York's agreement in November 2005 to pay $38 million to settle two U.S. criminal probes. Kelly said the bank remains prepared to enter "reasonable discussions" with Russia's customs service to resolve the matter. Lawyers for Russia on Wednesday said the bank has been uncooperative, and that they do not plan to seek a settlement. "The reason we're fighting this so aggressively is we know we have terrific defenses outside Russia," Kelly said in the interview. "The thing about lawsuits is, they always end, eventually." McCrohan expects a settlement, saying "investors are probably pricing a settlement into the company's stock." Founded in 1784 by Alexander Hamilton, Bank of New York is the oldest U.S. banking company. Mellon was founded in 1869, and grew to prominence under financier Andrew Mellon. Both companies quit branch banking this decade. Through Wednesday, Bank of New York Mellon shares had fallen 22 percent this year, compared with a 36 percent drop in the KBW Bank Index .BKX.
