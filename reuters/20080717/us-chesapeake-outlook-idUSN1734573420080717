 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - Natural gas company Chesapeake Energy Corp ( CHK.N ) will fund its ambitious exploration plans for 2009 and 2010 by selling assets rather than debt or equity, it said in a U.S. regulatory filing. 

 Over the next several years, Chesapeake is ramping up spending to develop the Haynesville Shale gas field in northern Louisiana and other plays. Chief Executive Aubrey McClendon has said Haynesville could be the most significant find in the company's history. According to the filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday, the company expects proceeds of $4.6 billion in 2008 from debt and equity offerings, but its heavy reliance on capital markets to fund growth has stirred some concern among investors and analysts. Chesapeake said it expected to sell undeveloped leasehold or producing properties for $3 billion to $4 billion in both 2009 and 2010. For example, Chesapeake said on Thursday it agreed to sell 90,000 acres of natural gas properties in the Woodford Shale in Oklahoma to oil major BP Plc ( BP.L ) for $1.75 billion cash. Also in the updated outlook, the Oklahoma City company hiked its production growth forecasts for both years to 19 percent from 16 percent for 2009 and 15 percent for 2010. Its 2008 forecast remains at 21 percent. In a note to clients on Thursday, Capital One Southcoast said Chesapeake's new outlook was in line with its expectations. The company's stock has fallen about 16 percent this week, outpacing a 12 percent decline in the American Stock Exchange index of natural gas companies .XNG. A sharp drop in crude oil and falling natural gas prices have contributed to the week's weakness in energy shares. Shares of Chesapeake tumbled $3.23, or almost 6 percent, to $53.44 Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange, in line with a nearly 6 percent drop in the gas company index.
