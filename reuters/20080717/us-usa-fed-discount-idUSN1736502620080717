 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Banks' direct borrowing from the Federal Reserve at the discount window rose in the latest week, one of the most tumultuous weeks for the U.S. banking system in decades, Fed data showed on Thursday. 

 The government unveiled a plan to shore up mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae FNM.N and Freddie Mac FRE.N on Sunday, but regional banks and smaller banks are under increasing strain and analysts warn the risk of more failures is rising. Banks' discount window borrowings averaged $14.30 billion per day in the week ended July 16, versus an average $13.01 billion per day the previous week. "The discount window borrowings still suggest there is a lot of stress in the financial system because the borrowings remain historically high," said Lou Brien, a strategist with DRW Trading Group in Chicago. Primary credit borrowings averaged $13.92 billion per day in the latest week, versus an average $12.86 billion per day the previous week. After withdrawals by panicked depositors led to the third-largest banking failure in U.S. history, banking regulators seized mortgage lender IndyMac Bancorp Inc IMB.N on Friday, July 11. Secondary credit borrowing, usually an emergency measure for banks under high stress, rose to an average of $279 million per day in the week ended July 16, from $57 million the previous week, the Fed said. The near-one-year-old credit crunch will sting global financial markets and the economy well into next year or even into 2010, according to a Reuters poll. Most of the 87 economists surveyed from across Europe, the United States and Canada see the worst not over and most feel the fallout will last at least another 6 to 12 months. The government and Federal Reserve granted U.S. mortgage finance agencies Fannie Mae FNM.N and Freddie Mac FRE.N the facility to borrow at the discount window as part of a government plan to shore up the mortgage giants. But there was no indication from the data that the two had borrowed from the central bank. Under the government plan, the Treasury Department would first extend its credit line to Fannie and Freddie before they would go to the Federal Reserve's discount window. Primary dealers borrowed an average $9 million per day from the Primary Dealer Credit Facility, or PDCF, after there were zero borrowings from the facility the previous week. It was the first occasion since the PDCF was started in March that dealers did not use it. The PDCF is one of several programs the Fed has introduced to provide cheap financing to financial institutions pinched by the credit crisis. The value of the net portfolio holdings of Bear Stearns in the holding company Maiden Lane LLC, set up after the Fed and JPMorgan rescued Bear, was stated as $29.02 billion on July 16, versus $28.94 billion on July 9.
