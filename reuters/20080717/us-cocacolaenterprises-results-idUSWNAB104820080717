 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Beverage bottler Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc ( CCE.N ) reported a quarterly net loss on Thursday, versus a year-ago profit, due to a large one-time impairment charge. 

 The world's largest bottler of Coca-Cola Co ( KO.N ) drinks reported a net loss of $3.17 billion, or $6.52 per share, in the second quarter, compared to a net profit of $270 million, or 56 cents per share, a year ago. Excluding a $5.3 billion charge, due to an expected decline in near-term North American operating income, the bottler earned 56 cents per share. In May, the company said second-quarter profit excluding items would fall in the mid- to high-single-digit percentage range. Before that, analysts had expected a gain of 5 percent. Coke Enterprises said at the time that the weakening North American economy was cutting into sales volume, especially in higher-margin 20-ounce bottles, which are sold in convenience stores and gas stations. Higher gasoline prices have cut into convenience store traffic, analysts have said. (Reporting by  Martinne Geller ; Editing by  Derek Caney )
