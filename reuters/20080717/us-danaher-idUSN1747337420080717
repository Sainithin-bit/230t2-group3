 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Industrial conglomerate Danaher Corp ( DHR.N ) reported better-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday, led by sales gains in its professional tools and medical technology divisions, as well as lower tax and interest expenses. 

 The company also raised its full-year profit outlook and shares gained 1.9 percent in pre-market trading. Net earnings rose 17 percent to $363.4 million, or $1.09 per share, in the second quarter from $311.2 million, or 96 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts, on average, expected profit of $1.06 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 25 percent to $3.28 billion, also ahead of estimates. Sales from existing businesses accounted for 5.5 percentage points of that increase. Each of Danaher's four divisions reported higher year-over-year sales, led by its professional instrumentation segments, where sales were up 53 percent, largely reflecting acquisitions. But each of the divisions also posted lower operating margins. Core sales growth of 10 percent at Danaher's medical unit was "exceptional," Deutsche Bank analyst Nigel Coe said in a note to clients. Danaher's outperformance was also helped by lower interest and tax expenses, Coe added. Washington-based Danaher, which makes communication and power protection products, water treatment systems, measurement devices and dental tools, said it expected third-quarter operating profit in a range of $1.09 to $1.14 per share, and raised its full-year profit forecast to between $4.34 and $4.42 per share. Analysts were looking for the company, which also makes Craftsman hand tools, to earn $1.09 in the third quarter and $4.36 for the full year, on average. Shares were up at $77.65 in premarket trading. (Reporting by Nick Zieminski; Editing by  Derek Caney , Maureen Bavdek and Dave Zimmerman)
