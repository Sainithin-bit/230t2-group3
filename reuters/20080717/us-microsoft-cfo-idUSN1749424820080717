 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp ( MSFT.O ) said on Thursday that it is facing a "tough environment" due to weakness in the U.S. economy, but added that the software maker has managed to avoid most difficulties. 

 "It hasn't hurt us significantly. It's what I would describe as a tough environment. It's clear other companies around us are suffering," Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Chris Liddell said in an interview with Reuters. Liddell's comments came on the heels of the company issuing a forecast for the current quarter that came in below Wall Street expectations. Microsoft also lowered its fiscal 2009 earnings forecast range by a penny. The CFO cited additional investments for its online business this fiscal year and said that the Internet advertising market was difficult at the moment.
