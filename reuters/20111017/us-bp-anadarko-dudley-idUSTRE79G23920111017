 MOSCOW  (Reuters) - BP's $4 billion settlement from partner Anadarko Petroleum over clean-up costs for the Gulf of Mexico disaster is favorable to both parties, its chief executive said. 
 "We regard it as favorable for both companies," Bob Dudley told reporters Monday. "I am very pleased that they stepped in and are now shouldering some of the responsibilities." BP had said Monday it had accepted the $4 billion payment, less than it might have won in court. Dudley said the settlement did not represent a concession, adding it was "a very substantial contribution by both companies" that would allow them to put uncertainty linked to the case behind them.
