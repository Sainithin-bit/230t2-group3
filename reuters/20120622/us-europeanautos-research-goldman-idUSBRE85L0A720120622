 (Reuters) - European auto stocks are poised to deliver higher returns over the next three years as companies benefit from better management and a growing middle-class consumer base, Goldman Sachs said, adding Volkswagen AG VOWG_P.DE, the world's second-biggest carmaker, to its conviction buy list. 
 The brokerage, however, lowered its target price on Renault SA ( RENA.PA ), Porsche Automobil Holdings SE ( PSHG_p.DE ) and Daimler AG ( DAIGn.DE ) by an average of 3 percent to reflect high market volatility and uncertainty. The STOXX Europe 600 Automobiles & Parts index .SXAP was down about 1 percent at 0800 GMT. Shares of BMW AG ( BMWG.DE ), Continental AG ( CONG.DE ), GKN Plc ( GKN.L ), Peugeot SA ( PEUP.PA ) and Pirelli & C SPA ( PECI.MI ) were all down more than 1 percent. Goldman, however, maintained its attractive view on the sector, and forecast a 10.8 percent return on invested capital for 2012 through 2014, compared with an average of 6.4 percent over the last decade. "The process of global economic realignment and the creation of a bulging middle class, particularly in developing economies, will deliver structurally higher average global car sales growth," Goldman wrote in a note to clients. Volkswagen is best positioned among global car companies with its well-balanced sales footprint and potential for substantial cost savings, the brokerage said. Goldman also upgraded tire makers Nokian Renkaat Oyj ( NRE1V.HE ) to "buy" and Michelin SCA ( MICP.PA ) to "neutral," given recent share price weakness and lower raw material costs. The brokerage also raised its price targets on Sweden's Volvo AB ( VOLVb.ST ) and Scania AB ( SCVb.ST ). Shares of Nokian fell 6 percent to 28.60 euros by 0735 GMT on Friday. Rheinmetall ( RHMG.DE ) was down 2 percent, while Fiat ( FIA.MI ) was up about 1 percent. (Reporting by Rachel Chitra; Editing by Tenzin Pema)
