 (Reuters) - Moody's Investors Service on Friday cut ratings on 24 issues of gas prepayment bonds worth about $19 billion. 
 The Wall Street credit ratings agency said the downgrades were knock-on actions from Thursday's rating cuts by Moody's for Citigroup, Inc, Goldman Sachs Group, Inc, Credit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Merrill Lynch & Co, Morgan Stanley, BNP Paribas, Royal Bank of Canada and Societe Generale. "These entities support certain payment obligations of the bonds," Moody's said in a statement. (Reporting by  Michael Connor  in Miami)
