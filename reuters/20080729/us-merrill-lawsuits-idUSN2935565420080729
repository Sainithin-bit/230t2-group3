 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Merrill Lynch & Co Inc, which already is fending off shareholder lawsuits about its subprime mortgage exposure, could be a target of plaintiffs' lawyers again following its latest revelations about its financial position. 

 The company said on Monday it would raise $8.5 billion by selling new stock, after Merrill CEO John Thain had said previously that the bank's capital position was adequate. Lawyers suing Merrill for securities fraud on behalf of investors declined to comment on whether the new disclosures would spur additional legal claims, but they said they are examining the news. "They are disturbing revelations, but at this point we are still analyzing the situation," said Merrill Davidoff, one of the attorneys representing the State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio, a Merrill investor that was named lead plaintiff in a proposed securities class-action against the financial firm. "We can't express a view as to how it would impact our litigation or as to what degree these recent revelations would play a part, although I think they are significant -- highly significant," said Davidoff, of law firm Berger & Montague. A Merrill spokesman, Mark Herr, said he was unaware of any new securities fraud cases filed against the firm in recent days. The company last week filed a motion to dismiss the pending class-action suit and other related shareholder suits also brought in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. The class-action was originally filed late last year. "We will continue to defend ourselves against litigation that has no merit," Herr said. Securities fraud claims brought by shareholders often revolve around what companies or individual executives said about a company's financial health or prospects before its stock falls sharply. To prevail in court on such claims, investors typically must prove that the person who made a false or misleading statement intended to deceive them, said Adam Savett, a vice president at RiskMetrics Group Inc who tracks class-actions. Thain, who took over as Merrill CEO late last year following big write-downs and credit losses, has consistently denied this year that the firm would need to raise more capital. In January, for instance, he was quoted as saying the firm was "very confident that we have the capital base now that we need to go forward in 2008." Walter Todd, a portfolio manager at investment firm Greenwood Capital Associates who does not hold Merrill shares, said he anticipates that plaintiffs' lawyers will seize on these kinds of comments by the Merrill chief as they pursue their cases. "My feeling is, if you don't know the answer to a question, you should keep your mouth shut," he said. "Thain was out there talking, saying 'we don't need capital, we can sell assets.' Don't tell me something you're not 100 percent sure of. There's a definite credibility issue with them." (Additional reporting by  Dan Wilchins , editing by Phil Berlowitz)
