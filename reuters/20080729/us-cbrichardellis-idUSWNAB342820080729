 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - CB Richard Ellis Group Inc ( CBG.N ), the world's largest commercial real estate brokerage, said quarterly net income plunged 88 percent, chiefly on lower brokerage fees from sales that have all but dried up due to the severely constrained global credit markets. 

 Second-quarter net income fell to $16.6 million, or 8 cents per share, from  $141.1 million, or 59 cents per share, in the year-earlier quarter, the company said on Tuesday. (Reporting by  Ilaina Jonas ; Editing by  Andre Grenon )
