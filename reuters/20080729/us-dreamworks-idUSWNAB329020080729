 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc said second-quarter profit fell sharply on Tuesday, but still topped expectations, helped by its hit "Kung Fu Panda" film, but warned of higher international marketing costs in the third quarter. 

 Strong earnings at the animated movie studio last year was due to revenue from its blockbuster "Shrek the Third," which was released earlier in the 2007 quarter than "Kung Fu Panda" was in the latest quarter. Net income fell to $27.5 million, or 30 cents per share, from $61.8 million, or 60 cents per share a year ago. Revenue dropped to $140.8 million from $222.5 million. Excluding items, DreamWorks posted earnings of 28 cents a share. On that basis, the result topped analysts' average expectation of 23 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenues beat analysts' average target of $121.8 million. "Kung Fu Panda" has grossed over $500 million worldwide since its June release, and is on track to become the company's most successful nonsequel film of all time. DreamWorks expects higher international theatrical marketing costs to increase the amount that its distributor needs to recoup. That will lower DreamWorks revenue in the third quarter. DreamWorks typically recognizes the majority of a film's revenue a few months after its release because its distributor, Viacom Inc, first recoups upfront marketing and distribution costs. To date, "Kung Fu Panda" has grossed about $210 million at the domestic box office, and contributed $46.4 million in second-quarter revenue, the company said. By comparison, the "Shrek" film released in May 2007 grossed over $300 million domestically in the year-ago quarter, a DreamWorks spokeswoman said.
