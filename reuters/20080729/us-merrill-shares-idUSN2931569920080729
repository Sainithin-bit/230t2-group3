 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Merrill Lynch & Co Inc shares fell 5 percent on Tuesday, after the bank said late Monday it was raising $8.5 billion of capital to offset losses from selling $30 billion of repackaged debt at a deep discount. 

 According to a source, Merrill priced the shares in the offering at $22.50, or about 7.5 percent below Monday's closing share price of $24.33. Merrill's moves could be seen as limiting future risk, but at a cost, analysts said. "You've done more damage to the balance sheet, you've diluted shareholders, and what happens during these times is they're so inwardly focused, so how can they focus on building their business profitably?" said Ralph Cole, portfolio manager at Ferguson Wellman Capital Management in Portland, Oregon, which does not own Merrill shares. Merrill's shares fell $1.20 to $23.13 on Tuesday morning on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by  Elinor Comlay , editing by Dave Zimmerman)
