 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc chief executive said on Tuesday he expects more Hollywood studios to sign deals in coming weeks to help finance several theatrical chains' digital conversion. 

 "We expect two or three studios to come on board in the next few weeks," Jeffrey Katzenberg, the CEO, said on conference call. "This will speed up the rate of roll out," said Katzenberg, a proponent of the format. Sources familiar with the matter said last week that News Corp's Twentieth Century Fox became the first studio to reach a tentative deal with a group of theater chains, paving the way for digital cinema upgrade that Hollywood hopes will boost attendance and cut costs.
