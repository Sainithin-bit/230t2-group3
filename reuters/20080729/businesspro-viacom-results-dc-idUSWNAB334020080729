 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Viacom Inc VIAb.N, the owner of MTV 
Networks, posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit on 
Tuesday, boosted by box office hits "Iron Man" and the latest 
"Indiana Jones," but U.S. cable network ad sales growth fell 
below the company's projections. 

  The New York-based owner of Paramount movie studios and the 
Nickelodeon cable network said second-quarter net profit fell 
to $407 million from $434 million a year earlier. Earnings per 
share were 65 cents per share, up from 63 cents a year earlier, 
when Viacom's share count was higher.  Revenue rose 21 percent to $3.86 billion.  Excluding items, Viacom's profit was 64 cents per share. On 
that basis, Wall Street estimated 58 cents per share, according 
to Reuters Estimates.  Shares of Viacom, which currently trade below its presplit 
levels, have fallen over 30 percent this year, compared with a 
more modest 11.5 percent decline for Time Warner Inc ( TWX.N ).  U.S. ad sales at Viacom's cable networks division rose 1 
percent, below the company's outlook of 3 percent to 4 percent 
growth.  (Reporting by  Kenneth Li ; editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)
