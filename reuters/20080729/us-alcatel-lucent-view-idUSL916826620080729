 PARIS  (Reuters) - Following are analyst comments after Alcatel Lucent announced the departure of both its chairman Serge Tchuruk and its Chief Executive Pat Russo. 

 ALEXANDER PETERC, EXANE BNP PARIBAS: These departures are not a total surprise. It is a good thing that the company can now move forward and put behind it the differences between the Lucent parts and Alcatel side. They must now look for someone from the outside who can get on with the task of building an integrated company. FREDERIC HAMM, FUND MANAGER AT AGILIS GESTION: Their departure is not a surprise. It could provide a boost to the stock. FRANCOIS DUHEN, ANALYST AT CM-CIC SECURITIES: They're average results. They used up 400 million euros of cash over the quarter. The adjusted margin isn't great. LONDON-BASED TRADER AT AN INVESTMENT BANK: People have been fed up with her leadership for a long time. The stock has been doing terribly. I think the market will look at the sales this morning. Overall, the numbers are not good and the outlook is bearish, and now the management is put into a slight conundrum and they have to go and try to find a new CEO. So until then, the leadership is questionable and the results are poor. PARIS-BASED ANALYST This departure will be greeted with relief. But it doesn't change anything about the need to turn the group around and the effect of these changes may not necessarily last. (Reporting by  Julien Toyer ,  Sudip Kar-Gupta ,  Blaise Robinson )
