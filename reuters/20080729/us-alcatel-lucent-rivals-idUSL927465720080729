 LONDON  (Reuters) - The latest sorry chapter in the Alcatel-Lucent story dented shares in other telecoms gear makers on Tuesday, but analysts said they were likely to benefit, if anything, from the Franco-American group's problems. 

 Alcatel-Lucent's chief executive and chairman both resigned on Tuesday, bowing to persistent shareholder pressure after another quarter of big writedowns of assets inherited from Lucent in the 2006 merger that created the company. The group repeated its downbeat forecast for a flat telecoms equipment market this year, blaming a deterioration in the economic environment and saying it saw signs of a slowdown in spending spreading from the U.S. to Europe. Shares in fellow telecoms gear makers Ericsson and Nokia, which owns half of the Nokia Siemens Networks joint venture, fell as some investors fretted that the already depressed sector had further to fall. But many analysts said that though the market remained tough, the firm's particular problems were largely of its own making and could benefit rivals. "It's an Alcatel-Lucent problem, quite specifically," said Nicolas von Stackelberg, telecoms analyst at private bank Sal. Oppenheim. "At Ericsson and Nokia Siemens Networks, sales have grown quite nicely." Alcatel-Lucent said spending on CDMA, a legacy technology still relatively widespread in North America and parts of Asia but little used elsewhere, had fallen faster than planned. It continued to bet on CDMA, Lucent's former great strength, despite declining sales, and has written down its CDMA assets several times. Lucent was once the world's biggest telecoms gear maker, and it fell hard when the telecoms bubble burst. Research firm Gartner estimates the CDMA market will decline by an average 8.4 percent a year in terms of sales until 2012. Richard Windsor, analyst at Nomura, said poor execution by Alcatel-Lucent, not economic conditions, was the main problem. "I don't think the asset is being particularly well managed, to be frank," he said. "We think they've lost some market share to Nortel and the Chinese vendors." Nortel, North America's biggest telecoms equipment vendor, gave a bullish outlook last month, predicting sales growth, better margins, lower costs and higher cash flow. Nortel was itself on the brink of collapse a few years ago but stripped down and refocused on emerging technologies under Chief Executive Mike Zafirovski before the current downturn began, putting it in a stronger position. Chinese rivals Huawei and ZTE have vastly improved the quality of their offerings in recent years and have made inroads into developed markets as they are still able to sell products and services at as little as half the price of rivals. LAST CHANCE? Most observers blame Alcatel-Lucent's problems on its clinging to CDMA and failure to reposition itself to embrace newer technologies after the merger, which made it the world's third-biggest telecoms gear provider. "When they did the merger they said they would have the broadest base of products, and I thought: 'Why do they want to do that?' says Sylvain Fabre, network infrastructure research director at Gartner. "That's something you can only do if you're very big or very cheap like Huawei. If you're smaller, you've got to focus." As a result, rivals such as Ericsson and Nokia Siemens Networks -- who have made a stronger play in the widespread and fast-growing W-CDMA standard -- are well placed to benefit from current trends, as well as a management void at Alcatel-Lucent. "The future for CDMA is grim, in my view," says Sal. Oppenheim's Stackelberg. "That's also the reason it was a daft idea to buy Lucent." "If you want to do things better you need to make a drastic change, and that's what they need to do now," he said. "Maybe find a small set of skills that you can monetize instead of trying to be too generic. I think it's probably the last chance." (Editing by Will Waterman)
