 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Stocks rebounded on Tuesday, rising more than 2 percent on another sharp slide in oil prices and after Merrill Lynch's MER.N latest write-down and share sale hinted at a possible turning point in the credit crisis. 

 Stocks were also helped by data showing the rate of monthly price declines in the U.S. housing market is slowing and a separate report showing the mood of American consumers improved for the first time in six months in July. U.S. crude prices dropped more than 2 percent, relieving some concern about inflation and consumer spending and brightening the outlook for a wide range of companies, including retailers and airlines. An index of airlines  .XAL  rose 11.4 percent while the S&P Retail Index .RLX gained 4.0 percent. Merrill Lynch jumped nearly 8 percent after coming into trade on the defensive after the brokerage said late on Monday it will write down $5.7 billion and raise $8.5 billion by selling new stock. After the share sale, sentiment on financial stocks began to shift, with investors saying Merrill's latest write-down may be a sign that banks are nearly through purging their balance sheets of bad mortgage debt. "There's always the hope that this might be the last big financial blowup," said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management in Bedford Hills, New York. "Some people think we may be getting toward the end in terms of large write-downs." The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  rose 266.48 points, or 2.39 percent, at 11,397.56. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  gained 28.82 points, or 2.33 percent, at 1,263.19. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  rose 55.40 points, or 2.45 percent, at 2,319.62. Crude oil for September delivery settled down $2.54, or 2.04 percent, at $122.19 a barrel. That was about $25 below an all-time high set earlier this month and helped stocks reverse the prior session's losses. "I think with oil at around the $120 area, that is giving the market a psychological uplift today" said John Schloegel, vice president of investment strategies for Capital Cities Asset Management in Austin, Texas. Financial shares rose broadly. Merrill Lynch shares rose 7.9 percent to $26.25 after falling about 11 percent in the prior session. Several analysts had widened their loss view for the brokerage after Monday's write-down news.  But on Tuesday analysts were taking a "glass half-full" view. Jim Awad, chairman of W.P. Stewart Asset Management in New York, called it "a feeling that Merrill is working its way through its problems." The KBW bank index .BKX, which tracks stocks of 24 major banks, gained 8.7 percent as Citigroup shares erased early losses to rise 5.9 percent to $18.45 and Bank of America ( BAC.N ) rose 14.8 percent to $32.22. Financial shares were also helped by expectations that the Securities and Exchange Commission would extend an emergency rule banning so-called naked short selling later on Tuesday in 19 companies including Fannie Mae FNM.N, Freddie Mac FRE.N, Citigroup ( C.N ), Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) and Merrill Lynch. Amgen ( AMGN.O ), the top biotechnology company, jumped 3 percent to $62.28, driving the Nasdaq higher, after the firm reported higher-than-expected quarterly profit late on Monday and raised its 2008 forecast.  Shares of Colgate-Palmolive ( CL.N ) climbed 8.2 percent to $74.15 after the consumer products maker reported quarterly earnings that beat Wall Street's estimates.  US Steel Corp ( X.N ) posted a record second-quarter profit that easily beat analysts' consensus forecast, sending its stock up 14.1 percent to $165.76. Energy companies were the largest decliners on the S&P 500, with ConocoPhillips ( COP.N ) losing 1.9 percent to $80.27. Trading volume was light on the New York Stock Exchange, with about 1.40 billion shares changing hands, below last year's estimated daily average of roughly 1.90 billion. But volume was high on the Nasdaq, with about 2.31 billion shares traded, above last year's daily average of 2.17 billion. Advancing stocks outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a ratio of more than 3 to 1 and by more than 2 to 1 on the Nasdaq.
