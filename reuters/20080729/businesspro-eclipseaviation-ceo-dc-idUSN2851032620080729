 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Eclipse Aviation Corp's Vern Raburn 
was forced to resign as chief executive as a condition for the 
injection of financing to the maker of the Eclipse 500 jets, 
the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday. 

  Citing people familiar with the situation, the Journal said 
a number of hedge funds and others from whom Raburn had sought 
capital continued to be dissatisfied that he remained in charge 
of Eclipse's everyday activities.  Raburn, who founded Eclipse in 1998, had proposed an 
airplane whose computer system would take much of the work out 
of flying, but important suppliers failed to deliver parts and 
forced Eclipse to delay deliveries, the Journal said.  The production issues angered investors and customers who 
have ordered 2,000 of the company's jets, and Raburn was forced 
to seek additional investors, according to the Journal.  The company's chairman, Roel Pieper, who will become its 
acting CEO, said Eclipse would focus on sorting out its 
production issues, according to the Journal report.  The company did not immediately reply to an e-mail seeking 
comment.  (Reporting by  Aarthi Sivaraman ; Editing by  Braden Reddall )
