 PARIS  (Reuters) - The departure of Alcatel-Lucent Chairman Serge Tchuruk may speed up efforts to sell the group's stake in Thales, Europe's largest defense electronics company which he helped to take public. 

 Analysts said a sale of the 20.8 percent stake was more likely because of a strategic disparity between the two groups, though Alcatel-Lucent's finance director stressed it was under no pressure to sell the shares to fund its operations. Alcatel obtained the stake after participating in Thales' privatization a decade ago and later handing it its satellite business and a package of other assets when it merged with Lucent in 2006, keeping defense work in French hands. Both chapters of Thales's 10-year history as an independent company were written with the close involvement of Tchuruk, who fought off the rival Lagardere family to position Alcatel as a key partner to Thales in an epic battle when it went public. But as it stumbled through a series of profit warnings and saw its share price fall sharply in recent months, Alcatel-Lucent was widely rumored to be looking at selling its Thales stake, worth some 1.5 billion euros ($2.4 billion). Hit by tough telecoms market conditions, Alcatel-Lucent, the world's largest maker of fixed-line telecoms equipment, said on Tuesday Tchuruk would resign in October. Chief Executive Pat Russo will also leave this year.  Analysts and defense industry sources said Tchuruk's planned exit raised new questions over the future of Alcatel-Lucent's stake in Thales, whose shares fell as much as 3.9 percent. "Following this resignation, I believe there is no real obstacle towards a disposal of this stake. I believe things will accelerate in the next few weeks," said Yan Derocles, analyst at Paris-based Oddo Securities. Dassault Aviation, whose controlling Dassault family owns 5.2 percent of Thales, again denied recent media reports that it is on the brink of buying the stake. "I've said before it is fantasy and I'll say it again," a company spokesman said on Tuesday. Alcatel-Lucent has also been reported to be talking to EADS, which failed to buy Thales in an informal approach in 2005. EADS Chief Executive Louis Gallois said in May that purchasing a stake in Thales was "not on the agenda". A deal seemed unlikely as long as Tchuruk decided the fate of strategic French interests at Alcatel-Lucent. But doubts had been gathering over the influence he held as non-executive chairman when the internal merger he masterminded hit problems. "Tchuruk has given no indication he wants to get rid of the Thales stake. But Tchuruk is not alone in Alcatel," a defense industry source said last week. CLAN WARFARE EADS is a major client of Thales and its avionics and other aircraft systems, but the two compete in defense security and in fiercely contested bids to build unmanned military aircraft. They are also present on competing fighter planes, the EADS-built Eurofighter Typhoon and Dassault's Rafale. Their roots can be traced to competing clans in France's constantly quarrelling defense industry -- the Thomson-CSF state defense firm and the Matra missiles company that was owned by Lagardere and later became part of EADS. Alcatel and Dassault were preferred over Lagardere in a bitter fight to see who would control a slice of Thomson-CSF when it went public at the end of last decade, becoming Thales. Any move to tie Thales to EADS would likely be resisted by Chairman Denis Ranque, a veteran of past battles with EADS and the longest-serving head of a top European defense company. If Alcatel-Lucent did decide to sell its stake, Tchuruk was seen as keen to obtain a premium that few wanted to pay. A sale on the market could however weigh heavily on Thales shares, which have resisted most of the falls in the European market this year, and harm Alcatel-Lucent's return. Thales was down 1.7 percent at 37.02 euros late on Tuesday. "After Tchuruk leaves, a board is bound to look at its options and it should be for Alcatel to say this stake doesn't fit happily with its future strategy," said Howard Wheeldon, a defense expert and senior strategist at BGC Partners. Alcatel-Lucent is tied in a shareholder pact at Thales to the French state which owns 26 percent and has a golden share. Tchuruk's departure could also have implications for French aero engine and communications company Safran. Safran Chairman Francis Mer tried to win support for a merger with Thales last year but was repelled by his own management as well as Thales's concerns about Safran's losses in mobile phones and its exposure to a weak dollar. Still, Thales executives have vaunted the strategic merits of a tie-up and Safran is expected to announce a plan for its loss-making phone handset business this week. One of the opponents of a deal, according to media reports, was Tchuruk on the grounds that it would prevent Alcatel-Lucent unlocking cash. (Editing by Malcolm Whittaker and  David Holmes )
