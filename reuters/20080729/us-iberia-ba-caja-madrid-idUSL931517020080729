 MADRID  (Reuters) - The main shareholder in Spain's Iberia IBLA.MC, savings bank Caja Madrid, is supportive of the Spanish flagship airline's plan to merge with British Airways BAY.L, a source close to the deal said on Tuesday. 

 "Caja Madrid is happy," the source told Reuters. The bank has a 23 percent share in Iberia which said earlier that it was talking with BA with a view to merging the two airlines. Spanish state holding firm SEPI, which holds 5.2 percent of Iberia stock, said it was interested in the merger. "As a shareholder, it could be an interesting deal," said a SEPI spokesman.
