 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Merrill Lynch & Co Inc still has more assets to write down after the investment bank took a $5.7 billion write-down from selling toxic assets at a deep discount, veteran banking analyst Charles Peabody said on Tuesday. 

 Merrill Lynch still has exposure to assets that could trigger more write-downs, including $8.8 billion of collateralized debt obligations, or $1.6 billion after hedges; $17.57 billion of commercial real estate assets; and $7.5 billion of leveraged loans, he said. "We know this is not the last of the hits Merrill will take when you look at all their exposure," said Peabody, co-founder of independent research firm Portales Partners. Write-downs could bring Merrill's 2008 losses to roughly $10 a share, Peabody wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday entitled "Latest Purge May Not Be The Last." Analysts on average expect Merrill to lose $8.54 a share before items in 2008, according to Reuters Estimates. In the first two quarters, the third-largest U.S. investment bank has lost $7 billion for common shareholders, or $7.18 a share. Peabody rates Merrill Lynch a "sell," and told Reuters, "we wouldn't touch Merrill here." Jessica Oppenheim, a spokeswoman for Merrill, declined to comment, citing a policy against commenting on analyst reports. Evidently at least some investors disagree with Peabody. The company's shares closed up $1.92, or 7.9 percent, to $26.25, even after the company said on Tuesday it sold $8.55 billion of shares at $22.50 apiece. Merrill Lynch has said it is cutting assets, and implied that the other assets in its portfolio are less risky. Chief Executive John Thain said on a conference call after the company posted a second-quarter loss that the bank sold commercial real estate assets without affecting its profits, signaling that the assets were marked at their fair value. Leveraged loan commitments fell 47 percent from the first quarter. "... (W)e have been reducing our risky assets," Thain said on the call. But Thain also said Merrill Lynch was well capitalized. Less than two weeks later, the bank said it was raising billions of dollars to help offset losses after it agreed to sell $30.6 billion of repackaged debt at 22 cents on the dollar. "While the stock may bounce on a relief rally, we think management has damaged its credibility. The deleveraging continues, regulatory scrutiny is rising, and further balance sheet marks need to be taken," Peabody wrote. (Editing by Phil Berlowitz)
