 (Reuters) - British Airways Plc BAY.L is in merger talks with Spain's Iberia IBLA.MC about an all-share tie-up to create the world's third biggest airline. 

 Following are key dates in talks between BA and Iberia: October 27, 1998 - BA confirms it has agreed to take a stake in Iberia alongside American Airlines.

November 15, 2006 - BA says it has purchased American Airlines' AMR.N stake in Iberia for 19 million euros ($24.3 million), raising its stake in the Spanish carrier to about 10 percent.
