 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - European Central Bank executive board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi is one of three candidates to succeed Mario Draghi as head of the Bank of Italy, Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said on Friday. 

 The other candidates are Fabrizio Saccomanni, director general of the Italian central bank, and Vittorio Grilli, the director general of the Italian Treasury, Berlusconi said. A decision on the replacement for Draghi has not yet been made but a candidate will be proposed next week, Berlusconi said. Draghi was appointed new head of the ECB on Friday to succeed Jean-Claude Trichet. (Reporting by  Giselda Vagnoni )
