 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp's ( 7203.T ) luxury Lexus brand jumped back to the top of an influential study of U.S. consumers' view of automotive quality, displacing last year's leader Porsche ( PSHG_p.DE ). 

 The widely watched J.D. Power and Associates U.S. Initial Quality Study, which records difficulties faced by new car owners in the first 90 days of ownership, found that overall quality of autos sold in the United States hit its highest level in 2011 in the survey's 25-year history. The survey ranks brands by the number of problems reported per 100 vehicles sold -- the industry's average stood at 107 for the year, down from 109 last year. Below are the top 10 brands for 2011: Brand 2010 rank Problems per 100 vehicles 1. Lexus 4 73 2. Honda 6 86 3. Acura 2 89 4. Mercedes-Benz 3 94 5. Mazda * 18 100 5. Porsche * 1 100 7.
