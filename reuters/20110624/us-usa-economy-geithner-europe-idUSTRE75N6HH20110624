 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said on Friday that Europe needs to step up efforts to deal with the debt crisis in Greece and other parts of the continent. 

 "They're going to have to do more than what they've been doing," he said in an interview on CNBC television. "You have these governments in Greece, Ireland and Portugal doing really, really tough things economically...and Europe is going to have to do more to make sure it has a broader financial backstop in place to allow those reforms to work."
