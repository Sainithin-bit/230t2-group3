 LONDON  (Reuters) - While governments and regulators dither, IntercontinentalExchange energy hub has moved ahead of the curve, with steps to boost transparency that could increase the lure of its flagship Brent contract over its U.S. rival. 

 Every Monday, ICE Futures Europe ( ICE.N ) will publish a breakdown of what kind of traders are active on its Brent and gasoil contracts, widely viewed as its most useful, global pricing benchmarks. The measure is imposed by the exchange, not the regulator, but narrows the regulatory gap between the ICE Brent contract and the world's most liquid futures contract U.S. futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX). "The move was long due and it is smart of the ICE to do it on a voluntary basis," said Olivier Jakob of Petromatrix, who has published forensic analysis of the U.S. regulator's data and will now scrutinize the ICE figures. "The ICE wants Brent to be the global crude oil benchmark and that would have been difficult without some added transparency." For decades, the U.S. regulator the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has produced a weekly breakdown of market participants for the range of commodities futures. The division was previously into commercial and non-commercial, loosely considered resource-holding companies and speculators respectively. Beginning in 2009 and phased in across different commodities, the categories have been redefined as producers, swap dealers, money managers and other reportables. The ICE has opted to use the same more granular divisions. Until this week's announcement, some traders had argued the lack of transparency on ICE relative to NYMEX could be an incentive to trade there for maker players seeking anonymity. In the event, analysts and traders said transparency was a good thing, as was self-regulation. "It's better to have a trading environment self-regulated rather than having the government tell you what to do," said one trader at an investment bank who asked to remain anonymous. One of the pioneers of the move into commodities as an asset class, who asked not to be named, said ultimately fundamentals of supply and demand still mattered most of all. "The larger factor causing any investors to move their crude positions from WTI to Brent is their belief in the underlying fundamental economics of the two markets," he said. BRENT STRENGTH Since late last year, Brent has enjoyed unusual strength relative to the U.S. futures contract and its premium to U.S. futures on NYMEX reached a record of more than $23 a barrel earlier this month. Volumes of trade on ICE's Brent still lags its U.S. equivalent U.S. crude, known as West Texas Intermediate (WTI), but in terms of percentage growth has outperformed. Gasoil has been particularly strong and in May around 4.9 million futures contracts traded, compared with around 2.6 million for heating oil. For many kinds of player, including long-term investors, such as pension funds as well as those seeking shorter term exposure, increased transparency is one more reason to buy and sell Brent rather than landlocked U.S. crude. "I think the two will flip in share. WTI will have the share that Brent had five years ago and vice versa," said a hedge fund trader based in New York who asked not to be named. "My view is that the oil market players have gotten more broad and as such have realized that a waterborne marker is a much better indicator than a land-locked one." Jakob said the breakdown could allay suspicion Brent's strength relative to U.S. crude meant Brent as well as U.S. futures had lost its connection to underlying physical reality and was distorted by trading plays. "It should stop the baseless speculation about price making manipulation in Brent," he said. The price impact is hard to quantify. But if traders knew speculators were net long, that might limit their appetite to also buy, which could prevent price trends being exaggerated. "If you see speculators are looking long, it might put you off going long yourself. You might think it's looking over-bought," said Tony Machacek of Bache Commodities. The effect of speculative and investment-class money, as opposed to buying and selling by producers and major consumers has been the subject of lengthy debate, but no-one has ever proved whether it inflates oil and other commodity markets. Regulators and governments, increasingly desperate to rein in rising commodity prices, are pressing for reforms, but so far they have been mired in the process. The head of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission said it would not introduce long-awaited position limit plans for commodities soon. [ID:nN1599324] Britain's Financial Services Authority, which regulates ICE's Brent and gasoil contracts, is regarded as light-touch. The president of ICE Europe said it worked in close collaboration with the regulators on both sides of the Atlantic. "The exchange continues to have a very important role in regulating the markets, but we work very closely with the regulators including the FSA in the UK and the CFTC in the U.S. We share information on a daily basis," David Peniket told Reuters in an interview.
