 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Federated Department Stores Inc. FD.N on Thursday posted a weaker-than-expected 2.3 percent rise in March sales at stores open at least one year, pressured by weakness in home-related merchandise sales. 

 Analysts on average had expected a rise of 3.6 percent, according to a Reuters poll. The parent of Macy's and Bloomingdale's had forecast March same-store sales would rise from 2.5 percent to 4 percent. Cincinnati, Ohio-based Federated said total sales were $2.29 billion for the five weeks ended April 7, up 1.5 percent from the year-ago period. Unseasonably cold weather also hurt sales of spring merchandise, the retailer said, adding that it expects total sales for first quarter to be at the low end of its previous forecast, which called for sales of $6 billion to $6.1 billion. For April, the retailer said it still expects same-store sales to rise 2.5 percent to 4 percent.
