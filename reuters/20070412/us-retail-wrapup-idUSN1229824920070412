 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - U.S. retailers reported stronger-than-expected March sales on Thursday, helped by an early Easter holiday and pent-up demand from a cold February, but warned that April will probably be a crueler month. 

 Many chains, including retail leader Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ), said comparable-store sales results will suffer this month, and some noted continued softness in sales of home goods amid the weak housing market. The Standard and Poor's retail index .RLX gained about one-half percent on the day, recouping earlier losses. "The Easter shift showed a greater-than-typical gain in (March)," said Dana Telsey, founder of research firm Telsey Advisory Group. "The giveback will occur in April, and that's what to watch going forward." Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, posted a better-than-expected 4 percent rise in March sales at U.S. stores open at least a year, above the 1.9 percent increase expected by analysts. Food and pharmacy sales were strong. But the Bentonville, Arkansas, company said April sales would be flat to down 2 percent because of the earlier Easter, and it warned that meeting its quarterly profit forecast of 68 to 71 cents per share from continuing operations would be difficult. "While the earnings guidance is still attainable, given the tough sales environment for the April period, it will be a challenge," Chief Financial Officer Tom Schoewe said in a statement. Easter fell on April 8 this year, compared with April 16 in 2006, so sales of holiday-related items came largely in March. PENT-UP DEMAND "There was definitely pent-up spring apparel demand from February," when sales were depressed by cold and stormy weather, said Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics Inc. Of 51 retailers his firm tracks, 69 percent topped sales expectations for March, Perkins said. Still, "the (April) numbers are probably going to be very low" given the Easter shift, Perkins added. In a research note, forecaster Weather Trends International said that last month was the warmest March in three years -- but cautioned that April was expected to be the coldest in 24 years, likely hurting same-store sales. In March, sales strength was across the board as teen retailers, discounters and other specialty apparel chains posted rises. Even Gap Inc. ( GPS.N ), which had posted lower or flat same-store sales in every month but two since June 2004, turned in a March gain of 6 percent. On Wednesday, Wal-Mart rival Target Corp. ( TGT.N ) said its March same-store sales rose 12 percent, but forecast April sales should fall 2 to 4 percent. Among department stores, J.C. Penney Co. Inc. ( JCP.N ) said March comparable sales at its department stores rose 10.6 percent on strong demand for clothing, beating its own and Wall Street's forecasts. Dillard's Inc. ( DDS.N ) also had stronger-than-expected sales, and Kohl's Corp. ( KSS.N ) boosted its same-store sales forecast for the first quarter to a rise of 5 percent from a previous view of a 2 percent to 4 percent jump. A MISS AT FEDERATED But Federated Department Stores Inc. FD.N, the parent of Macy's and Bloomingdale's, said March same-store sales rose a lower-than-expected 2.3 percent. It had forecast growth of at least 2.5 percent, while analysts had expected 3.6 percent. Federated, which plans to change its corporate name to Macy's Inc. this year, said sales suffered from continued weakness in home goods and cold weather before Easter. The luxury sector continued a strong run, with Nordstrom Inc. ( JWN.N ) posting a 15 percent rise in March same-store sales, compared with an 8.6 percent gain expected by analysts. Though the March results showed spring is off to a good start, coming months could be affected by higher fuel costs and the housing slowdown, said Michael McNamara, vice president of research and analysis at SpendingPulse, the retail data service of MasterCard Advisors. "The negative effects from gasoline and housing on consumer spending are still there, and they are having rippling effects in some (retail) areas," McNamara said. Federated and Penney noted soft sales of home goods, and furnishings chain Pier 1 Imports Inc. ( PIR.N ) reported a fourth-quarter loss on Thursday. Among other retailers, AnnTaylor Stores Corp. ( ANN.N ) said same-store sales rose 6.1 percent in March on strength at its flagship Ann Taylor chain and improvement at LOFT stores. And Limited Brands Inc. ( LTD.N ), operator of the Victoria's Secret, Bath & Body Works and Express chains, said sales at established stores rose 8 percent in March. But it said margins fell as soft sales forced it to cut prices.
