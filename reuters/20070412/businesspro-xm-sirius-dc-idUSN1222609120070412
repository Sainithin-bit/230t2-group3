 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - XM Satellite Radio Holdings Inc. 
XMSR.O and Sirius Satellite Radio Inc. ( SIRI.O ) said on 
Thursday they received a request from the U.S. Department of 
Justice for more information on their proposed merger, sending 
their shares higher in after-hours trading. 

  Both companies said they planned to respond expeditiously 
to the request, which had been widely expected by analysts.  "It doesn't surprise me at all. I didn't think anything was 
going to sail through on this merger. I would expect it to be 
as complicated as it can be," said David Bank, an analyst with 
RBC Capital Markets.  U.S. antitrust authorities issue such a request, known as a 
second request, if an initial review turns up potential 
antitrust problems. It requires the companies to turn up large 
amounts of information and is followed by a more in-depth 
investigation.  Justice Department spokeswoman Gina Talamona said the 
investigation of the XM-Sirius deal is continuing, but declined 
further comment.  Sirius plans to buy XM in an all-stock deal worth about $4 
billion, but the merger has been criticized by some U.S. 
lawmakers and consumer groups as anti-competitive.  Sirius and XM must win approval from the Justice 
Department's antitrust division, as well as from the Federal 
Communications Commission, for their deal to be completed.  In trying to persuade lawmakers that a combined Sirius-XM 
would benefit consumers, Sirius Chief Executive Mel Karmazin 
recently told a congressional panel satellite radio subscribers 
would be able to block adult channels and get a refund for 
those channels.  Sirius shares rose 2.3 percent to $3.15 in trading after 
the bell on Thursday, while XM shares rose 1.3 percent to 
$12.30 on the news.
