 ZURICH  (Reuters) - Nestle SA ( NESN.VX ) on Thursday said its $5.5 billion purchase of U.S. baby-food maker Gerber from Novartis AG ( NOVN.VX ) would improve its operating profit margin immediately. 

 "We expect this transaction to be EBIT margin enhancing in year one for the Nestle group," a Nestle spokesman said. The spokesman said Nestle saw considerable room to expand Gerber in North America. Nestle had a margin of 13.5 percent on earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) in 2006, the spokesman said.
