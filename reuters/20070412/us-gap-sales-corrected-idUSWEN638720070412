 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Gap Inc. ( GPS.N ) said on Thursday its March sales at stores open at least a year rose 6 percent. 

 Analysts, on average, had been expecting the San Francisco-based clothing retailer to post a same-store sales decrease of 1 percent, according to a Reuters survey. Gap, which runs Banana Republic, Old Navy and its namesake Gap stores, said net sales for the five weeks ended April 7 rose 16 percent to $1.56 billion from $1.35 billion a year earlier.
