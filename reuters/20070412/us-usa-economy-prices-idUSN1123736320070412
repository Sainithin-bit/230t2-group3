 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. import prices jumped a larger-than-expected 1.7 percent in March as petroleum prices rose sharply, Labor Department data showed on Thursday. 

 The rise in import prices, the largest increase since May 2006, was far steeper than the 0.8 percent rise forecast by Wall Street analysts. Petroleum import prices rose 9 percent after rising 0.6 percent in February, the largest one-month increase since an 11.3 percent gain in April 2006. The cost of non-petroleum imports showed a 0.3 percent gain after a 0.1 percent rise the previous month and the biggest increase in three months. Export prices rose 0.7 percent in March as prices for agricultural and nonagricultural goods increased, compared with a forecast for a 0.4 percent gain Import prices are scrutinized by the Federal Reserve as a potential source of inflation in the production pipeline. Capital goods import prices fell 0.1 percent, automotive vehicles and parts rose 0.1 percent while consumer goods excluding autos were 0.2 percent higher.
