 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Internet phone company Vonage Holdings Corp. ( VG.N ) said on Thursday that its Chief Executive Officer Michael Snyder stepped down and that it would cut costs, amid growing worries about its future after setbacks in a patent lawsuit by Verizon Communications Inc. ( VZ.N ). 

 Vonage Chairman Jeffrey Citron has been appointed as an interim CEO and will serve on a short-term basis, the company said. It gave a preliminary estimate for revenue of $195 million for the quarter ended March 31.
