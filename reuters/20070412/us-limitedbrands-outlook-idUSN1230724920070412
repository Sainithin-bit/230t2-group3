 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Retailer Limited Brands Inc. ( LTD.N ) said on Thursday it expects same-store sales in April to rise at a low-single-digit percentage rate, due to the shift in the Easter holiday this year. 

 The company also said it expects its Express chain's performance to meet expectations for the combined March-April period.
