 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - An early Easter and strong demand for clothing boosted U.S. retail sales in March, but rising gasoline prices and a soft housing market cast doubts about spending in coming months, according to data published on Thursday by SpendingPulse. 

 Consumer spending outside the auto sector rose 0.3 percent last month on a seasonally adjust basis, a touch higher than a 0.2 percent gain in February, said SpendingPulse, the retail data service of MasterCard Advisors, an arm of MasterCard Worldwide ( MA.N ). SpendingPulse's "core" gauge on retail sales climbed 0.2 percent last month, a tad higher than the 0.1 percent rise in February. The core reading excludes autos, gasoline and building materials, whose sales tend to be volatile month-to-month. "Overall, the spring retail season has gotten off to a good start," said Michael McNamara, SpendingPulse's vice president of research and analysis. Easter fell on April 8 this year, about a week earlier than in 2006, so holiday-related items such as candies sold mostly during retailers' March sales periods. For example, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ), the world's largest retailer, recorded a stronger-than-expected 4 percent rise in same-store sales. In addition to an earlier Easter this year, sales by discounters and general merchandisers were boosted by a jump in demand for clothing. Year-over-year apparel sales rose 5.8 percent in March, more than double the 2.5 percent gain in February, the report showed. Despite a solid start to spring, SpendingPulse's McNamara cautioned that rising gasoline prices and anxiety about a weak housing market could cause consumers to reduce trips to restaurants and shopping malls, especially in the South and Midwest, where driving is the main mode of transport. Retail gasoline prices averaged $2.80 a gallon last week, up 10 cents from the prior week, the Energy Information Administration said on Monday. "The negative effects from gasoline and housing on consumer spending are still there, and they are having rippling effects in some (retail) areas," McNamara said. The housing slowdown continued to rein in demand on furniture and home appliances, he said. Last month, year-over-year sales of furniture were down 1.7 percent and consumer electronics, which include home appliances, were off 1.1 percent, McNamara said.
