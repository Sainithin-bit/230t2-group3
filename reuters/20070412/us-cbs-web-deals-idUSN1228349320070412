 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - CBS Corp. is close to announcing deals to distribute TV shows to various Web sites, including Microsoft Corp.'s MSN and Time Warner Inc.'s AOL, according to a report on the Wall Street Journal's Web site on Thursday. 

 The Journal said CBS could announce the agreements on Thursday. The deals will make previously aired episodes of shows such as "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation," the "Evening News with Katie Couric" and some sports programming available to the sites, the paper said. CBS is also expected to announce an agreement with Joost, an online-video service founded by the creators of the Internet-telephone service Skype, the Journal said. CBS wants to keep 90 percent of the ad revenue generated by its videos, while the remaining would go to its distribution partners, the Journal cited unnamed sources as saying. The company is also in talks to have a new NBC Universal-News Corp. venture distribute its shows on a nonexclusive basis, the paper reported. CBS could not be immediately reached for comment.
