 TORONTO  (Reuters) - Magna International MGa.TO would make 
a "big commitment" in a possible joint bid for 
DaimlerChrysler's DCXGn.DE DCX.N Chrysler division, a 
national newspaper said on Thursday. 

  The Globe and Mail said Magna chairman Frank Stronach had 
confirmed that Magna was in talks with buyout conglomerate Onex 
Corp. ( OCX.TO ) about working on a Chrysler bid.  "It's a big sum we would allocate," Stronach told the 
newspaper. "We would make a big commitment."  The newspaper said on Wednesday that a joint Magna/Onex bid 
would match Magna's expertise in auto manufacturing operations 
with Onex's skill in financial operations, key to running 
Chrysler's finance arm.  Onex has not commented.
