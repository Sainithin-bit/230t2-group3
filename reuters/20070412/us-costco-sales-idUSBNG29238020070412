 (Reuters) - Warehouse club operator Costco Wholesale Corp. ( COST.O ) on Thursday reported a better-than-expected 6 percent rise in March sales at its stores open at least a year. 

 The company said one less day of sales in its latest March period, which ended on April 8, hurt sales by about 3 percent. That, however, was offset to some extent by the timing of Easter, the company said in a recorded statement. The net was a 1 percent to 2 percent negative impact on March sales, it added. Analysts on average expected a 4.8 percent rise in same-store sales, according to a poll by Reuters. Net sales for the month rose 11 percent to $5.94 billion, from $5.37 billion from the same period last year. For April, Costco expects a 3.5 percent benefit by an extra day of sales, which will be offset by about 1.5 percent due to the timing of Easter. Year-to-date, the company reported net sales of $38.11 billion, an increase of 9 percent from $35.02 billion during the similar period last year. The year-to-date net sales included a $224 million adjustment to the sales returns reserve previously reported in the fiscal 2007 second-quarter results.
