 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of Sprint Nextel Corp. ( S.N ) rose 2.6 percent on Thursday after a report that a shareholder had built up a stake of nearly 1 percent and was calling for major changes at the No. 3 U.S. wireless service. 

 The Wall Street Journal said Relational Investors -- activist shareholder Ralph Whitworth's $6.7 billion investment firm -- had built a stake of about $500 million in Sprint. The report, citing unnamed sources, said Whitworth, in meetings with Sprint management, had called for several changes at the company, including a pullback in capital spending and a potential sale of its fiber-optic long-distance network. Sprint and Relational Investors could not be reached for comment. Sprint shares were up 60 cents to $19.68 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange after rising as high as $19.78 earlier in the session. Atlantic Equities analyst Chris Watts said some investors could be reacting positively to the Journal report, but he added that it would be difficult for any one investor to build enough of a stake in Sprint to gain any control. "They could become a flag carrier for other investors who rally and try to put pressure on management to do the same thing," Watts said. He said he was not surprised by investor concern over Sprint's plan to spend up to $3 billion over three years to build a high-speed wireless network using new technology known as WiMax. "There's a view out in the market that the visibility on returns on WiMax is uncertain right now," he said. "Investment stories are never popular while you're doing them unless visibility on the future returns is excellent. That's probably not the case on the WiMax roll-out." Watts said it was unclear whether a sale of Sprint's long-distance network would  create enough value to make it worthwhile, as Sprint would then have to pay rival service providers to carry cell phone calls between its wireless broadcast towers. "I can't see it making a huge amount of difference," said the analyst, who estimated that the wired network creates about $700 million annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization for Sprint. "You're really only looking at $4 billion in the context of a company that has a market capitalization of about $55 billion," Watts said.
