 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A Sprint Nextel Corp. ( S.N ) shareholder has built up a stake of nearly 1 percent in the wireless carrier and called for major changes at the company, the Wall Street Journal reported on its Web site on Thursday. 

 Relational Investors -- activist shareholder Ralph Whitworth's $6.7 billion investment firm -- has built a stake of about $500 million in Sprint, the Journal said, citing unnamed sources. Whitworth has called for several changes at the company during meetings with the management, including a pullback in the company's capital spending and a potential sale of its fiber-optic networking and long-distance operation, the Journal said. Relational Investors could not immediately be reached for comment.
