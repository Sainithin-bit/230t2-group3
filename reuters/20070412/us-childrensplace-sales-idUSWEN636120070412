 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Children's Place Retail Stores Inc. ( PLCE.O ) said on Thursday that sales at stores open at least a year rose 7 percent in March, helped by strength at its Disney Store chain. 

 Wall Street analysts, on average, had been expecting a same-store sales gain of 6.9 percent, according to Reuters Estimates. The children's clothing retailer said total sales for the five-week period ended April 7 rose 18 percent to $204.7 million. It said it expects first-quarter earnings to be little changed from the year-earlier period, when it earned 52 cents per share. For the full fiscal year, Children's Place stood by its forecast for earnings of $3.63 to $3.73 per share, before any expenses related to a stock option investigation. Analysts on average had been expecting 63 cents per share for the first quarter and $3.72 per share for the year, according to Reuters Estimates.
