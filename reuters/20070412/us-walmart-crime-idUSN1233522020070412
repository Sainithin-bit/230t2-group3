 ST. LOUIS  (Reuters) - The case of former Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) Vice Chairman Thomas Coughlin was back in court on Thursday as an appellate court took up a prosecutor's plea that Coughlin's home confinement sentence was too light. 

 Robert Balfe, the U.S. attorney for the Western District of Arkansas, told the 8th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in St. Louis it appeared that Coughlin, who admitted to stealing thousands of dollars from the company, was spared prison because he was a well-known businessman. Balfe also said arguments the 57-year-old's health problems would worsen behind bars were unproven. "There is no evidence established about what would occur or that the prison environment would have worsened his condition." Coughlin, who joined Wal-Mart in 1978 and worked closely with legendary founder Sam Walton, had faced up to 28 years in prison and $1.35 million in fines after he pleaded guilty in January in federal court in Arkansas to wire fraud and tax evasion. But he was sentenced to 27 months of home confinement after testimony that he suffered a range of medical problems including diabetes, cardiac disease, sleep apnea, arterial blockage and other ailments. The sentence also called for five years of probation and restitution of about $411,000. Defense attorney Blair Brown told the three-judge panel that Coughlin's condition could be life-threatening were he sent to prison. "Going to prison could kill him," Brown told the court. The judges reacted with some skepticism and speculated on Thursday about the validity of allowing someone to escape punishment in prison because of poor health. A ruling is expected sometime in the next few weeks. In a separate ruling, the Arkansas Supreme Court said Wal-Mart may sue the former executive for fraud and allow a jury to decide whether it can recover money from Coughlin.
