 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Clothing retailer Abercrombie & Fitch Co. ( ANF.N ) said on Thursday that sales at established stores rose 7 percent in March, driven by strength at its abercrombie and Hollister chains. 

 Wall Street analysts had been expecting same-store sales to range between a decline of 2 percent to an increase of 6 percent, with an average view of a rise of 1.6 percent, according to a Reuters survey. Total net sales were $331.2 million for the five-week period ended April 7, up 29 percent from a year earlier.
