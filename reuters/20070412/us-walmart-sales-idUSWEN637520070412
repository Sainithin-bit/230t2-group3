 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) on Thursday reported a stronger-than-expected 4.0 percent rise in March sales at U.S. stores open at least a year. 

 Analysts, on average, had been expecting a same-store sales increase of 1.9 percent, according to a Reuters survey, while Wal-Mart had forecast a rise of 1 percent to 2 percent. The company said that for April, it expects U.S. same-store sales to be flat to down 2 percent.
