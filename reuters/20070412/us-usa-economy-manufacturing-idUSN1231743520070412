 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Manufacturing is set for stepped-up growth as the year progresses, according to the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI survey released on Thursday. 

 The March composite index rose to 58 from 54 in the December survey, its first quarterly increase after a three-quarter slide. The index above 50 indicates that overall manufacturing activity is expected to increase over the next three to six months. The quarterly survey is of 60 respondents from a broad range of manufacturers. "Most industries, with the exception of those businesses closely linked to the housing sector, should expand this year although the rate of expansion is likely to be less than in recent years," said Donald Norman, economist at the group and the survey coordinator. Six of the ten factors measured by the quarterly survey were higher than the previous report. "The survey results of this quarter are evidence of latent strength in most manufacturing industries and are a harbinger of renewed vigor in the latter half of the year," said Norman. For example, shipments showed the biggest gain, rising to 73 from 62. It was the first increase since December 2005. Also showing a healthy gain was the investment index, which queries executives on their expectations regarding capital investment in 2007 compared to 2006. The index rose to 71 from 64. "What this quarter's responses show is that the floor hasn't fallen out from under the manufacturing sector and it looks like the respondents in this group see some signs of strength," Norman said. However, the orders index, which compares new orders during the first quarter, compared to the same time a year ago, fell to 60 from 66, underscoring the current slowdown in the manufacturing sector. In addition, the inventory index inched up.
