 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Rite Aid Corp. ( RAD.N ), the third-largest U.S. drugstore chain, said on Thursday its quarterly profit fell and it now expects to buy the U.S. Brooks and Eckerd drugstores from Jean Coutu by the end of May. 

 The $3.86 billion cash and stock deal with Canada's Jean Coutu Group (PJC) Inc. ( PJCa.TO ), announced back in August, still needs final regulatory approval by the Federal Trade Commission. Attorneys general of several states are also reviewing the deal. Rite Aid said it expects to post a loss this year but the acquisition should add to earnings in fiscal 2009. Shares of Rite Aid, which had risen 8 percent since the beginning of April, fell nearly 3 percent before rebounding. Rite Aid said it reached an agreement with FTC staff to divest 24 stores in Connecticut, Maryland, Maine, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Vermont. That pact is subject to approval by FTC commissioners, which Rite Aid said it expected to obtain. Goldman Sachs analyst John Heinbockel said in a research note that the pact was positive. He had expected 100 stores or more would need to be divested for the deal to be approved. The acquisition includes about 1,850 U.S. Brooks and Eckerd stores and six distribution centers mainly on the East Coast and in the Mid-Atlantic states, giving Rite Aid a more dominant presence in the East. Rite Aid had planned to pay Jean Coutu $1.45 billion in cash, 250 million Rite Aid shares and assume $850 million of Coutu debt. Rite Aid will no longer be assuming the notes, and said it would pay $2.3 billion in cash and issue the shares. PROFIT FALLS, ADJUSTED EARNINGS RISE Rite Aid's profit was $15.1 million, or 1 cent a share, in the fiscal fourth quarter ended March 3, compared with $1.25 billion, or $1.83 per share, a year earlier, when the company got a boost from a large income tax benefit. In the fourth quarter, Rite Aid was hit by an $18.7 million charge for the early redemption of debt and a $16.2 million inventory charge. Analysts, on average, expected Rite Aid to earn 3 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Adjusted earnings rose 11 percent to $201 million as the company cut costs. Revenue fell 4.4 percent to $4.56 billion. The quarter included one less week than a year earlier. Sales at stores open at least a year rose 3 percent. For the current fiscal year 2008, Rite Aid expects sales of $25.3 billion to $26 billion. The fiscal 2008 guidance includes nine months of expected results from Brooks and Eckerd. The net loss for fiscal 2008 should be between $47 million and $129 million, or a loss of 11 cents to 23 cents per share, including an estimated expense of $145 million to integrate the acquired stores, Rite Aid said. Same-store sales, which will not include the to-be acquired stores until one year after that deal closes, should rise 3.8 percent to 5.8 percent in fiscal 2008, Rite Aid said. The company expects the acquisition to add 18 cents to 20 cents per share to profitability in fiscal 2009. Rite Aid also forecast about $225 million in cost savings from the deal, stemming from merchandising, purchasing, advertising, distribution and administration. Rite Aid had 3,333 stores in operation at the end of the quarter. It trails behind CVS/Caremark Corp. ( CVS.N ) and Walgreen Co. ( WAG.N ), which have about 6,200 stores and 5,675 stores, respectively. Shares of Rite Aid were up 15 cents to $6.38 in late morning trade on Thursday after falling as low as $6.05 on the New York Stock Exchange.
