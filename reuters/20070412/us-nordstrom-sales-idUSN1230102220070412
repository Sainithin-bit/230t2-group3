 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Nordstrom Inc. ( JWN.N ) said on Thursday that March sales at stores open at least a year rose 15 percent, beating analyst expectations helped by strong sales of designer clothes and children's shoes an apparel. 

 Wall Street, on average, had been expecting Nordstrom to post a same-store sales increase of 8.6 percent, according to a Reuters survey. A quirk in the retail sales reporting calendar and the earlier Easter this year helped most retailers' March sales because purchases of Easter apparel and related goods were shifted into the March selling period from April. Nordstrom expects the calendar shift to pressure April sales, with sales in that month falling below the mid-single digit same-store sales increase the company expects for the first quarter. The Seattle-based retailer said preliminary data indicated total sales for the five weeks ended April 7 rose 14.2 percent to $803.2 million.
