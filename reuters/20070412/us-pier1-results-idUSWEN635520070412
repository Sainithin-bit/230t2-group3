 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Home furnishings retailer Pier 1 Imports Inc. ( PIR.N ) on Thursday reported a larger quarterly loss on lower sales as customers gave a cool reception to its revamped product selection. 

 The net loss widened to $58.7 million, or 67 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended on March 3 from $9.98 million, or 11 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding special charges, the loss was $12.9 million, or 14 cents per share. Analysts had expected a loss of 31 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Fourth-quarter sales fell 6.4 percent to $473.7 million, and merchandise margins declined by 610 basis points, mainly because of an inventory valuation charge of about $32.5 million. The company said the charge was a necessary part of its plan to clear out excess inventory before the end of the first quarter. Most of that merchandise consisted of modern, craftsman style items, Pier 1 said. Pier 1, which has posted 13 consecutive months of declining same-store sales, also said it will no longer report them on a monthly basis. Instead, it will now report sales every quarter. The company has now seen eight straight quarterly losses as customers continue to resist its modernized furniture selections and wider array of home fashions like curtains and glassware. On Monday, Elliot Associates LP., a shareholder with a 5.5 percent stake in the company, said it was puzzled by Pier 1's restructuring efforts and called on it to close a significant number of stores to curb expenses.
