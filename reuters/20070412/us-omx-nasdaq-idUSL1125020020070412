 STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - Nordic bourse operator and technology firm OMX OMX.ST said on Thursday it was in cooperation talks with several exchanges although it had not received any bids, and its shares rose more than 13 percent. 

 Swedish newspaper Dagens Industri reported Nasdaq Stock Market Inc. ( NDAQ.O ) had made a 23 billion Swedish crown ($3.33 billion) indicative bid for its Nordic peer. "Following media speculation, OMX confirms that it is in exploratory discussions with several exchanges and other market venues regarding possible forms of cooperation," it said in a statement. "OMX further confirms that no offer, formal or informal, has been received by the company." Business daily Dagens Industri quoted sources as saying the top U.S. electronic stock exchange had offered 192 crowns per share for the Nordic and Baltic exchange owner and technology firm, although it added the bid level was uncertain. "A fair offer would be 200 or 202 crowns. The company said this morning they have not got any offer, but none-the-less, there is no smoke without fire," West LB analyst Johannes Thormann said. Nasdaq was not immediately available for comment. OMX spokesman Niclas Lilja would not confirm if Nasdaq was one of the exchanges with which it was in talks. "We only want to be clear on that talks are being held and that it is a natural part of the growth and internationalization in the sector," he said. "But we will not comment on with whom or about what we are discussing." OMX shares were up 13.2 percent at 180.5 crowns by 0821 GMT after rising more than 18 percent to an intra-day high. The Stockholm bourse's broad All Share Index  .OMXSPI  was off 0.4 percent. CONSOLIDATION Amid a wave of consolidation in the exchange industry, not least due to investors' needs to trade across borders and time zones, Nasdaq has held talks with the Philadelphia Stock Exchange as one of several possible buyers, a source familiar with the situation said on Wednesday. "Exchanges are making a lot of money these days, but they also face increasing competition which is making bourses more willing to consolidate," ABG Sundal Collier analyst Karl Berglund said. "I think everybody agrees that it (consolidation involving OMX) will happen. OMX is a pawn in the game, but exactly when it will happen is hard to say." OMX owns and operates the exchanges in Stockholm, Helsinki, Copenhagen, Reykjavik and the Baltic countries and also makes trading technology for exchanges. In a Reuters interview late last month, OMX Chief Executive Magnus Bocker was coy about rumors linking OMX with the London Stock Exchange ( LSE.L ), which rejected a bid from the Nordic firm in 2000, or a U.S. partner. The Swedish government -- OMX's second-biggest owner after investment firm Investor ( INVEb.ST ) -- has said it plans to sell its 6.6 percent stake in OMX as part of the country's biggest privatization program ever.
