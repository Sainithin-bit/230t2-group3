 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Early 2007 has been marked by severe weather and public relations disasters at airlines like JetBlue Airways ( JBLU.O ) and US Airways Group ( LCC.N ), but the string of bad luck and blunders does not threaten a longer-term industry recovery, experts say. 

 "Those are one-offs," said airline consultant Michael Boyd. "It doesn't change the fundamentals where you have stable fuel prices and -- at the moment -- stable labor relations, and you've got a strong economy." Major airlines are set to report profits for the first quarter, according to analysts polled by Reuters Estimates. If those forecasts are accurate, then the U.S. airline industry will have extended a rebound that started last year. The industry recovery from a years-long slump is still in the early stages. But cost cuts, capacity reductions and fare hikes left most major carriers well-positioned for the service disruptions of January through March. "Airlines have the ability to weather a downturn," Boyd said. In the first quarter, carriers endured two major winter storms that forced thousands of cancellations and delays. For several days in February, JetBlue struggled to restore service in the wake of an East Coast snow storm. The meltdown stemmed largely from operational failures at JetBlue, which suffered a blow to its reputation for good customer service. JetBlue predicted the storms would cost it $30 million. A few weeks later, US Airways angered its customers when a glitch in its self-service reservation system forced thousands of travelers to wait in lines for up to three hours. As a backdrop to these snafus, oil prices -- directly related to the price of jet fuel -- were relatively stable although still historically high. JP Morgan on Thursday reduced estimates for most major airlines, noting the challenges of the first quarter. "Barring cheap fuel or consolidation, '08 earnings growth may be reserved only for the Chapter 11-christened," wrote JP Morgan analyst Jamie Baker in a research note. Bankrupt Delta Air Lines Inc. DALRQ.PK and Northwest Airlines Corp. NWACQ.PK are expected to exit Chapter 11 protection in the next few months after slashing their costs. Baker also predicted that rising labor costs will weaken airline earnings in the near future. He noted, in particular, that AMR Corp's AMR.N American Airlines faces calls from its unions for higher compensation. JP Morgan cut its first-quarter profit forecast to 26 cents per share from 32 cents per share. Stuart Klaskin of KKC Aviation Consulting agreed that the first three months of 2007 were rockier than the comparable period of 2006. He said airline earnings may miss expectations but not by much. "The industry is recovering, but the industry has not yet mounted a solid, sustainable recovery," Klaskin said.
