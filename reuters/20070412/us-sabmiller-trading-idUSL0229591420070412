 LONDON  (Reuters) - SABMiller's annual beer volumes rose a higher-than-expected 10 percent, the company said on Thursday, and hinted it was not looking to make acquisitions in western Europe such as Scottish & Newcastle (S&N). 

 S&N shares were the biggest losers in the FTSE 100 index, off 3.2 percent at 579-1/2p, as SABMiller was one of the leading and most realistic names in the frame to bid for S&N, having the resources and lack of anti-trust barriers, analysts said. SABMiller ( SAB.L ) ( SABJ.J ) Chief Financial Officer Malcolm Wyman did not comment directly on talk it may bid for Britain's biggest brewer S&N, but said the global brewer saw the beer market in western European as "singularly unattractive." He said the slow volume decline in the western European beer market meant it was "not an area we find attractive". S&N, the Foster's and Kronenbourg brewer, earns over half its profits in the area, helped by its leading positions in Britain and France. "It does seem like old rumors resurfacing and bubbling up again," he added on a conference call after a trading statement. SABMiller shares rose 1.8 percent to 11.39 pounds by 1000 GMT, the FTSE 100 index's top riser, as investors welcomed its comments distancing itself from acquisitions in western Europe and the group's strong annual beer volume growth. SABMiller, the world's second-biggest brewer and the maker of Miller Lite, Peroni, Castle and Chinese Snow beers reported the 10 percent rise in its underlying beer volumes for its year to end-March against a forecast for a 9-percent plus rise. It cautioned its good revenue growth was partly offset by higher costs on raw materials such as aluminum and barley and increased marketing spend in South America and Europe, but said its financial performance was in line with its own expectations. SUMMER SEASON The trading statement covered the peak summer season in its southern hemisphere operations in South Africa and South America, its two biggest regional profit earners. Analysts said volume growth was extremely strong, with the annual rise of 10 percent implying a similar or better performance in the group's fourth quarter to end-March, with all areas apart for Miller ahead of expectations. Despite volume declines at Miller and input cost pressures, house broker Cazenove increased its earnings per share forecast for the March 2007 year to 116 US cents from 114, and to 129 cents from 127 for the year to March 2008. In its South African beer business, which earns just over 30 percent of group profit, annual volumes rose 2 percent, with fourth-quarter volumes up 8 percent as it benefited from hot weather. In South America, where the group bought Bavaria in October 2005, annual beer volumes rose 12 percent. In North America, where the group brews Miller Genuine Draft and Milwaukee's Best, annual sales to retailers fell 3 percent in the year, with top brand Miller Lite down 1 percent. The brewer said its annual volumes rose 11 percent in Europe, driven by Poland, Russia and Romania and helped by an exceptionally mild winter, while Africa and Asia volumes grew 27 percent, boosted by a 30 percent rise in China. Analysts said the European performance would reflect positively on rivals heavily exposed to central and eastern Europe, like Carlsberg ( CARLb.CO ), S&N, and Heineken ( HEIN.AS ). In January, London-based SABMiller reported beer volumes up 10 percent in its third quarter and 9.5 percent for the nine months to end-December. It recorded a 5 percent rise in its previous financial year. Its shares have dipped from a high of 12.48 pounds at the time of its January update, hurt by the loss of its license to brew Amstel beer in South Africa last month and rand softness.
