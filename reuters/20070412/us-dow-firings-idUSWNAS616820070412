 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Dow Chemical Co. ( DOW.N ), the largest U.S. chemical company, fired a top executive and a board member on Thursday, accusing them of engaging in unauthorized discussions to sell the company. 

 The two men, Romeo Kreinberg, head of Dow's performance plastics operations, and Pedro Reinhard, a senior adviser and member of the board, are accused of engaging in a "business activity that was highly inappropriate," according to a statement from Dow. "These employees went to great lengths to hide this from us," said Dow spokesman Chris Huntley, "We have no idea in terms of what their motivations were." Midland, Michigan-based Dow has recently been the subject of leveraged buyout rumors and has been linked with a number of possible deals since January this year. Dow gave no details on the alleged sale discussions and did not name any other participants. Reinhard, who was formerly finance head at Dow, could not be immediately reached for comment, while Kreinberg denied the allegations and said no proof of anything was offered to him. "I can't imagine where this has come from. I've been 30 years with the company and I'm extremely surprised about everything that has happened today," said Kreinberg, in a telephone interview with Reuters. Kreinberg said he is seeking legal advice at this point in time and might consider legal action against the company. Kreinberg was a member of the company's executive leadership committee and in charge of its performance businesses, which contribute about half the company's annual revenue. Reinhard was Dow's chief financial officer for 10 years before stepping down from that post in late 2005. He is currently on the board of Colgate-Palmolive Co. ( CL.N ) and the board of Royal Bank of Canada ( RY.TO ) ( RY.N ). An analyst who followed the company while Reinhard was CFO said Dow's allegations didn't surprise him. "Pedro has always wanted to run a company. Pedro was in the running at one point to take over the company," the analyst said. Reinhard's termination will not be official unless he tenders his resignation to the board or is voted off the board, a Dow spokesman said. Based on Dow's proxy statement filed on March 23, Reinhard beneficially owned 321,968 shares in the company, while Kreinberg beneficially owned 103,579 shares. Dow said it received information on April 10 about the alleged actions of Reinhard and Kreinberg, from a source it would not identify. The board was informed on April 11 and the employment of the two was terminated with full support of the board on Thursday, Dow said. "We will move on to shape our future with an even greater resolve to execute our strategy and deliver value to our shareholders." Chief Executive Andrew Liveris said. Dow did not immediately comment on its plans to fill the vacancies left by the firings. The firings highlight a hot topic among merger and acquisition lawyers and investment bankers -- when a corporate executive should inform the board or superiors about conversations with a potential buyer. "Holding conversations without apprising the board is inappropriate," said Charles Elson, director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. "You hope you create a culture where this sort of thing doesn't happen. It's hard to police," Elson added. The topic has been in the limelight as the presence of private equity buyers has surged in the last two years, with few companies immune from their interest. Private equity deal volume has jumped to more than 20 percent of global M&A, up from the single digits only a few years ago. Last Sunday, a British newspaper reported that a consortium was preparing a $50 billion bid for Dow. On Monday, the company said it had had no discussions about a leveraged buyout. Hassan Ahmed, an analyst with HSBC, said Dow's action against the two officials indicates that the company was in play and could continue to be a buyout target. "What it tells us is that already there was a board member who was in favor of private equity, so I would like to believe that maybe there are others who are thinking along the same lines." said Ahmed. Whether the company receives a bid or announces a share buyback, it would only help boost the company's share price, he added. Shares of the company have risen about 11.5 percent over the last three months, while the Standard and Poor's Chemicals Index .GSPPM has only risen 3.4 percent during the same period. Dow shares closed up 2 percent at $46 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday. (Additional reporting by  Michael Flaherty ,  Michael Erman ,  Lisa Lee  and  Matt Daily )
