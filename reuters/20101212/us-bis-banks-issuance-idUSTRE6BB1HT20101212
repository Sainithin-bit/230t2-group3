 LONDON  (Reuters) - The dollar remained the currency of choice for issuers of emerging market bonds in the third quarter, while bond issuance in euros halved, the Bank for International Settlements said in its quarterly survey. 

 "The share of the dollar remained stable at 83 percent of developing economy issuance, whereas that of the euro halved to 9 percent," the BIS said. At 10 percent, issuance denominated in an emerging market currency was the highest in a year, although volumes remained "relatively small" compared to U.S. dollar issuance. During the third quarter of this year the dollar became increasingly popular as a funding currency on expectations that the Federal Reserve would keep U.S. interest rates near zero and resort to a second bout of quantitative easing. Bond issuance by residents in developing economies grew by 26 percent to $39 billion in the third quarter, just short of the high of $42 billion in the final quarter of 2009, the BIS report said. Issuance increased in all regions except Latin America and the Caribbean, where it fell 8 percent due to sharply lower issuance by non-financial corporations in Mexico.
