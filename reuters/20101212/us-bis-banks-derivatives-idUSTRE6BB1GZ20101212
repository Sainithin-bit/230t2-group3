 LONDON  (Reuters) - Turnover in foreign exchange derivatives in emerging markets is rising at a significant pace, with a growing number of cross-border deals, the Bank for International Settlement said in its quarterly review. 

 Still, overall derivatives markets in these countries remain small compared to those in advanced economies. Average daily turnover of derivatives in 33 emerging market economies stood at $1.2 trillion in April 2010, compared to $13.8 trillion in advanced economies. Offshore trading of emerging market currencies has increased in both absolute and relative terms since 2007, the BIS said. The share of currencies which were traded offshore increased by more than 20 percent over the past three years, led by the Indian rupee, the Chilean peso, the Colombian peso and the Russian rouble. "Derivatives turnover in emerging markets is becoming more and more global," the BIS noted. "Not only is an increasing share of emerging market transactions crossborder as opposed to domestic, but the two large financial centres of emerging Asia continue to grow in importance as home to an increasingly large share of OTC derivatives trades not involving the local currency." HONG KONG AND SINGAPORE LEAD Trading in over-the-counter fx derivatives is highly concentrated in Hong Kong and Singapore at 69 percent, while trading in China has risen by a factor of 10 from a very low base. "While the role of the Singapore and Hong Kong dollars is significant in Asian markets, much more noticeable is the degree to which the two centres serve as a trading platform for other currencies," the BIS added. Derivatives in emerging markets economies (EMEs) are used mainly to hedge or speculate on exchange rate risk, with FX derivatives accounting for half of all turnover in emerging markets. Foreign exchange over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives in EMEs account for 90 percent of total turnover, versus 50 percent in advanced economies, a reflection of the greater depth of bond and money markets in the developed world. The BIS triennial survey of fx turnover showed OTC derivatives in EMEs increasing by 24 percent between 2007 and 2010, despite the global financial crisis. FX swaps comprise the lion's share of the turnover at over 70 percent, followed by outright forwards, options and currency swaps. Trades with other financial institutions such as pension funds and hedge funds, has increased the most to 30 percent of total turnover, while trade with other reporting dealers, normally commercial and investment banks, fell to 58 percent from 61 percent. The percentage of transactions in EMEs involving emerging market currencies on one side increased to 60 percent in 2010 from 55 percent in 2007 out of a potential 200 percent. By contrast, the turnover of global reserve currencies other than the US dollar such as the euro, yen, pound sterling and Swiss franc generally declined in relative terms in 2010. In particular, the share of the Swiss franc halved, probably reflecting the unwinding of derivatives positions which had hedged Swiss franc loans made in emerging Europe before the financial crisis. The Australian dollar was an exception among advanced economy currencies, as its share in total turnover in EMEs increased to around 8 percent, which is quite similar to its share in advanced economies. This reflected Australia's position as a major supplier of commodity exports to much of emerging Asia. (Editing by Toby Chopra)
