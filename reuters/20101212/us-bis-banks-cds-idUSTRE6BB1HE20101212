 LONDON  (Reuters) - The sharp decline in outstanding credit default swaps since 2007 is a result of more efficient ways of settling overlapping trades and not a sign of falling appetite, said a Bank for International Settlements report. The principal amount of debt insured by CDS contracts fell to $30 trillion at the end of June 2010 from a peak of almost $60 trillion in 2007, but trading volumes continued to rise over the same period, the BIS December Quarterly Review said. 

 The increased use of central counterparties, which allow market participants to net offsetting positions -- effectively tearing up contracts which cancel each other out -- has resulted in trade compression. "In the absence of trade compression, the volume of CDS would have continued to grow to an estimated $80 trillion," the report said. The $30 trillion of outstanding CDS was made up of $2.4 trillion in sovereign CDS and $16 trillion of corporate CDS, with the remaining amount linked to CDS indices, the bank said. A move toward standardization of CDS contracts has also allowed agreements to be torn up more easily. Previously, market participants wishing to quit a position would simply open a new offsetting trade rather than negotiating an early exit, resulting in dealers becoming highly interdependent. The global financial crisis of 2008 highlighted this systemic risk and has prompted structural changes. Central counterparties cleared around $9 trillion of CDS by the end of June 2010 since CDS clearing began in March 2009, and are estimated to have eliminated around five sixths of the contract volumes assigned to them, BIS said.
