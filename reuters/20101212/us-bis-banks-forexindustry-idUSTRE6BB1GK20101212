 LONDON  (Reuters) - Major players in foreign exchange are gaining share in the industry as electronic trade transforms the market, pushing aside smaller banks who cannot keep pace with technology spending, the Bank for International Settlements said. 

 The largest dealers -- such as Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ), UBS ( UBSN.VX ), Barclays ( BARC.L ) and Citi ( C.N ) -- have seen their FX businesses grow by investing heavily in their single-bank proprietary trading systems, the BIS said in its quarterly report. "The tight bid-ask spreads and guaranteed market liquidity on such platforms are making it unprofitable for smaller players to compete for customers in the major currency pairs." BIS says its own data shows daily average trading volumes on the top single-bank trading systems have increased by up to 200 percent over the last three years. This has helped drive growth in FX volumes as smaller banks become clients of the top dealers for major currency pairs, concentrating instead on providing a market for local currencies. GROWTH IN HIGH-FREQUENCY TRADING The BIS said growth in FX was driven by high-frequency trading -- an algorithmic strategy profiting from incremental price movements with frequent, small trades executed in milliseconds. This accounts for around 25 percent of spot activity, it said, citing market estimates. The emergence of retail trading, which now accounts for 8-10 percent of spot FX turnover globally, is also pushing up volumes, as well as the increased trading by smaller banks as clients of the larger ones. "Electronic trading and electronic brokering are transforming FX markets by reducing transaction costs and increasing market liquidity. These changes, in turn, are encouraging greater participation," the BIS said. The BIS' latest triennial survey showed trade on global currency markets jumped by a fifth in the three years to 2010 to $4 trillion a day. BIS said Greenwich Associates, a consultancy, estimates more than 50 percent of total FX volume is being executed electronically. It added that electronic trade could boost volumes in countries outside the main financial centers like London and New York in the coming years. Electronic broking and multi-bank trading systems are more important for spot trading, however, it added. Instruments such as FX swaps, which embody counterparty risk, are harder to trade electronically. FINANCIAL CRISIS IMPACT During the 2007-2009 global financial crisis most parts of the FX markets "continued to function relatively smoothly," although FX swaps were "severely disrupted." The robustness of FX markets owes much to the role of CLS Bank in eliminating settlement risk, the BIS said. The financial crisis has changed the focus in FX markets and attracted the attention of regulators. Customers are reportedly relying more on bank credit lines and central bank facilities instead of the FX swap market, while regulators have increased capital requirements for retail FX brokers and reduced the leverage available to individuals. "Regulators are focused on reducing systemic risk and increasing the robustness of electronic infrastructure by increasing the use of central counterparties."
