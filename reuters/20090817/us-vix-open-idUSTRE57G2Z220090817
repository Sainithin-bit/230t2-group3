 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The CBOE Volatility Index .VIX jumped more than 15 percent on Monday as U.S. stocks tumbled on renewed concerns about the potential strength of the economic recovery. 

 The widely-watched VIX, considered to be Wall Street's fear gauge, often moves inversely to the broad S&P 500 index  .SPX . Major U.S. stock market indexes were down more than 2 percent shortly after the opening bell. (Reporting by  Leah Schnurr ; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
