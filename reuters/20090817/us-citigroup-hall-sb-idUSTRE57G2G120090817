 (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc energy trader Andrew Hall may be persuaded by the bank to accept stock instead of cash in 2010, Bloomberg said, citing people familiar with the matter. 

 Hall, who according to media reports stands to make as much as $100 million this year, might not accept such an offer, as his pay is not based on Citi's performance but on the performance of Citi's Phibro LLC energy trading arm, which he heads, the news agency said. Citigroup could not be immediately reached for comment by Reuters. Kenneth Feinberg, the Obama administration's pay czar, said on Sunday that Citi included Hall's contract in submissions due Friday by seven major companies still locked in the federal government's TARP Program. Feinberg said he has not looked at Hall's contract, which reports have said could pay him as much as $100 million this year. (Reporting by  Ajay Kamalakaran  in Bangalore, editing by Gerald E.
