 (Reuters) - The deal initialed last week between the United States and Switzerland over UBS will involve the disclosure of around 5,000 holders of secret Swiss accounts, weekly newspaper NZZ am Sonntag said on Sunday. 

 Following is a timeline of recent events at UBS: April 1, 2008 -- Doubles its writedowns as a result of the credit crisis, dumps its chairman, Marcel Ospel, and seeks more emergency capital. It proposes its lawyer, Peter Kurer, as Ospel's successor. May 6 -- Says it will axe 5,500 jobs and sell billions of dollars of ailing assets to weather the subprime crisis. June 19 -- A former UBS banker who once smuggled a client's diamonds into the U.S. in a toothpaste tube pleads guilty to helping a billionaire hide $200 million from U.S. tax authorities, part of a broader tax evasion probe of UBS. October 16 -- Announces it is to get 6 billion Swiss francs ($5.55 billion) from the Swiss government for a 9.3 percent stake and is to unload $60 billion of toxic assets into a new central bank fund. November 12 -- Raoul Weil, head of UBS AG's wealth management business, is charged with conspiring to help thousands of wealthy Americans hide $20 billion of assets from U.S. tax authorities in Swiss bank accounts.

February 19 - U.S. tax authorities say they are still pursuing a civil lawsuit seeking to access details on 52,000 UBS clients. February 20 -- Warns that it could go out of business if it complies with an order to reveal the names of suspected U.S. tax dodgers and would require it to violate Swiss law in a manner that would expose it to penalties. February 26 -- Appoints Oswald Gruebel, former head of rival Credit Suisse, as chief executive, replacing Marcel Rohner.

March 13 -- Switzerland agrees to make concessions on bank secrecy amid a global crackdown on tax evasion.

July 9 -- A judge orders the U.S. government to say whether it was prepared to shut Swiss bank UBS AG in the United States. July 10 -- Gruebel sends a memorandum to the bank's top executives saying the bank could not comply with the U.S. request to disclose the identity of the 52,000 account holders.

Swiss prosecutors launch an investigation the next day. July 31 -- A U.S. Justice Department attorney says the U.S. and UBS AG have reached an agreement in principle to settle their dispute.
