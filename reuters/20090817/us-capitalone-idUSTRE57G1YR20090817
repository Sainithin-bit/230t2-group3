 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Capital One Financial Corp's ( COF.N ) U.S. credit card defaults and delinquencies rose in July, as Americans kept losing jobs and struggled to pay their debts. 

 In a regulatory filing on Monday, Capital One said the annualized net charge-off rate for U.S. credit cards -- debts the company believes it will never collect -- increased to 9.83 percent in July from 9.73 percent in June. Capital One, one of the largest issuers of Visa and MasterCard credit cards, said accounts at least 30 days delinquent -- an indicator of future loan losses -- inched up to 4.83 percent from 4.77 percent. For U.S. auto loans, Capital One's charge-off rate rose to 4.26 percent in July from 3.89 percent in June, and the delinquency rate increased to 9.22 percent from 8.89 percent. In international operations, including Canada and Britain, the charge-off rate went up to 9.76 percent in July from 9.26 percent in June, while the delinquency rate fell to 6.68 percent from 6.69 percent.
