 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's economy grew 0.9 percent in the three months to June, ending its longest recession in decades on the back of exports and government stimulus spending, but analysts say it will be a long road to a sustained recovery. 

 While a moderate expansion is expected to continue in coming quarters, economists say risk of a double-dip recession cannot be ruled out especially if recovery is delayed in the United States and other major economies. *************************************************************** KEY POINTS: -- Gross domestic product grew 0.9 percent in the April-June quarter, slightly below the consensus forecast for 1.0 percent growth and following a revised 3.1 percent decline in the previous quarter. -- The return to growth puts Japan in the first camp of G7 countries that have pulled out of recession, along with Germany and France, after the global financial crisis dragged much of the developed world into its deepest slump in decades. -- On an annualized basis, the Japanese economy grew 3.7 percent in the second quarter, slightly less than the median forecast for 3.9 percent growth. -- External demand, the balance of exports and imports, boosted GDP by 1.6 percentage points. Falling domestic demand detracted 0.7 percentage points from growth. COMMENTARY: YOSHIKI SHINKE, SENIOR ECONOMIST, DAI-ICHI LIFE RESEARCH "We can see the positive impact of a rebound in exports in second quarter GDP data. Government stimulus is also having an impact. The recovery in domestic demand is likely to continue, so we may see very strong growth in the third quarter. "The increase in consumption is a one-off due to government stimulus, but this will eventually fade away. "The one problem is capital expenditure hasn't staged a great recovery, and this could be a problem for the economy in the future." KYOHEI MORITA, CHIEF ECONOMIST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL JAPAN "The headline figures were slightly weaker than expected but the contents were not surprising. The data reflects an increase in exports, as well as a rise in consumption and public investment thanks to economic stimulus measures. But today's data was driven by stimulus steps in Japan and overseas, and Japan's economy is far from self-sustaining growth. "The growth level for the July-September quarter will likely be similar to that of April-June, and the pace of growth is expected to slow down thereafter as the effects of government stimulus run their course. "The data was neutral for the Bank of Japan's monetary policy. Without strong recovery in consumption and capital investment, it is unlikely that the central bank will raise interest rates." MARI IWASHITA, SENIOR STRATEGIST, DAIWA SECURITIES SMBC "The data shows the recovery was led by external demand while domestic demand was weak. Considering that it may be difficult to expect external demand to keep making a similarly significant contribution in the next quarter, it raises doubts about the sustainability of growth in the next quarter. "The effects of government stimulus were evident in the recovery in consumption and capital investment to some extent, so when these effects wear off, growth prospects become a bit shaky. There may be calls for additional stimulus. "It is possible the weakness in domestic demand may become clearer in the July-September quarter, and positive growth may not be attained. "The deflator figures show downward pressure on prices remain, making it difficult for the BOJ to consider an exit policy." YASUO YAMAMOTO, SENIOR ECONOMIST, MIZUHO RESEARCH INSTITUTE "The rise in external demand was the biggest factor behind GDP growth. On the domestic demand front, both personal consumption and public investment rose but this was thanks to the government's economic stimulus. Areas such as housing investment, capital spending and inventory investment are still pushing down domestic demand." JUNKO NISHIOKA, CHIEF ECONOMIST, RBS SECURITIES "The annualized figure is slightly below the forecast, but I think it was partly due to technical reasons. My interpretation is that it is a very good figure. "The positive contribution of public spending is likely to continue, so I don't think there will be a return to (contraction), as feared by some. "On the other hand, the boost from government stimulus measures is expected to wear off and the unseasonably cold weather is likely to have some negative impact, so in the third quarter, we cannot expect a high growth rate like that of the second quarter. "Capital spending is likely to remain negative for the rest of the year, but other than that, consumer spending, public spending and exports are expected to make positive contributions." MARKET REACTION: -- The yen initially slipped against the dollar and then firmed to 94.68 per dollar from about 94.74 before the release. The yen gained to 134.10 per euro from 134.35. -- September 10-year JGB futures rose 0.13 point to 138.11 shortly after the GDP release. -- The Nikkei share average opened down 0.7 percent a few minutes after the data and continued to fall.
