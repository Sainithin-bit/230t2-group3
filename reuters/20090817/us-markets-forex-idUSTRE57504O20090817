 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar and the yen both retained broad gains on Tuesday as uncertainty over the strength of a global economic recovery saw investors cut exposure to riskier assets and higher-yielding currencies. 

 Stocks on both sides of the Atlantic were hit while the Chicago Board Option Exchange Volatility Index .VIX, or Wall Street's "fear guage," jumped nearly 15 percent to a one-month high, a sign that investors expect more wild swings in U.S. shares. Most of the fall has come amid light trading volumes due to the summer break in the northern hemisphere. The dollar index -- the dollar against a basket of six currencies-- was up 0.38 percent, not far from a two-week peak of 79.514 hit on Monday. On the yen, the dollar was slightly weaker at 94.38, down from 94.44 yen late in New York on Monday. The euro hovered near two-week lows on the yen, having fallen to as low as 132.45 yen in the previous session. High-yielding currencies like the Australian and the New Zealand dollars were on the defensive, having shed more than 1.3 percent and 1.5 percent respectively on Monday. Just Friday, the Aussie had hit a 11-month high, while the kiwi had jumped to a 2009 peak, before retreating. "The rally in the equity markets seemed to be pushing faster than what the economic data was suggesting," said Stephen Roberts economist at Nomura Australia. He was referring to a rise of more than 40 percent U.S. stocks since their March low. The Shanghai composite index  .SSEC , another market currency traders are keeping a close eye, is still more than 50 percent higher since the start of the year. But it has shed 17.5 percent after hitting a 14-month high two weeks ago. "So the pullback in risk is part of an adjustment that is taking place. Having said that, some of the data, like Japan's GDP numbers, is definitely encouraging, so I expect high-yielding currencies to drift upwards in coming months," Roberts said. Data on Monday showed Japan's economy grew between April and June for the first time in five quarters, while New York state factory output spiked in August. Confidence among home builders, which tends to have a good correlation to actual housing starts in the U.S., also edged up in August. For Tuesday, German ZEW is the main data out of Europe while in Australia minutes from the last board meeting of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) will be released at 0130 GMT. At its August meeting, the bank decided to shift to a neutral stance on monetary policy and investors are pricing in chances of the first rate hike in November. (Editing by  Wayne Cole )
