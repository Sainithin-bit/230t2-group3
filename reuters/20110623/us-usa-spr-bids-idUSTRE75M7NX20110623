 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. sales of "sweet" crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) will have a base price of $112.79 a barrel, a spokeswoman for the SPR said on Thursday. 

 Traders can bid above or below the "Base Reference Price" (BRP) of $112.79, which is derived from the last five days of trading of Light Louisiana Sweet (LLS) crude oil, as assessed by energy pricing agency Argus. The United States said on Thursday it would supply half of a planned 60 million-barrel emergency release of crude oil from members of the International Energy Agency, in a bid to cover supplies lost from Libya during the peak demand summer driving season.
