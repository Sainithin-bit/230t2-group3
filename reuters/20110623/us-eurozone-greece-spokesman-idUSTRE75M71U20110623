 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Greece has concluded talks with European Union and International Monetary Fund inspectors on its five-year austerity plan and will put the legislation to parliament next week, its government spokesman said on Thursday. 

 "I have just talked to the minister of finance, who reported that discussions between the government and the troika have been completed and we are moving to the adoption by parliament next week of the mid-term targets and the first implementation law," spokesman Elias Mossialos told Reuters at an EU summit in Brussels. Earlier, a source familiar with the talks in Athens said a deal had been reached to close a 3.8 billion euro funding gap in the Greek program. (reporting by Paul Taylor, editing by Noah Barkin)
