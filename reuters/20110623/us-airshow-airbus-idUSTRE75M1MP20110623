 LE BOURGET, France  (Reuters) - European planemaker Airbus has secured 730 aircraft orders and commitments at the Paris Air Show worth $72.2 billion at list prices, sales chief John Leahy said on Thursday. 

 Airbus now has 1,029 orders and commitments for its revamped A320neo family of aircraft, Leahy told a press conference. Leahy said Airbus may announce a further order at the air show, either later on Thursday or on Friday, hinting that it could come from Gulf carrier Qatar Airways. The number of planes sold at the show beat Airbus' previous air show record of 728 aircraft, Airbus said. (Reporting by  Tim Hepher ; Editing by  James Regan )
