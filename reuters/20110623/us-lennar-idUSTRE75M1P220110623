 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Homebuilder Lennar Corp ( LEN.N ) posted a larger-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday on both cost cuts and surprisingly high revenue and said it expects to be profitable for the full year. 

 Lennar's revenue from home sales fell 6 percent to $649.8 million, the company said in a statement. But that was much less of a decline than most analysts had expected. "They're able to drive demand. They got people in the door," said ITG analyst Demir Gjokaj. "It's too early to say what's behind it, but the fact that people are coming out and looking at new homes and buying new homes is definitely a positive." Still, sales of new homes industrywide fell 2.1 percent in May, the U.S. Commerce Department said on Thursday. The third-largest U.S. builder reported earnings for the second quarter ended May 31 of $13.8 million, or 7 cents a share, down from $39.7 million, or 21 cents per share, a year before. Wall Street analysts on average had expected earnings of 4 cents per share. Miami-based Lennar, which builds homes in 14 states including Florida and California, used the housing slump to buy land more cheaply. The houses built on that land have higher margins, another reason the company was still able to make a profit. The company is one of the few to start a distressed land operation -- Rialto Investments, whose operating earnings were $9.8 million, up from $5.1 million last year. "We liked the renewed focus on taking costs out of Corporate, which helped SG&A nicely," wrote Ticonderoga Securities analyst Stephen East, noting that sales, general and administrative expenses were 18.1 percent of revenue compared with the 19.2 percent he had anticipated. Lennar's shares were up 1.8 percent at $18.43 in late morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
