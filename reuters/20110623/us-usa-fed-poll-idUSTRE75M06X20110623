 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Most economists from top financial institutions expect the Federal Reserve to hold interest rates near zero through the middle of next year while the central bank grapples with high unemployment and a slowdown in growth, according to a Reuters poll. 

 Of 19 of the 20 primary dealers -- the large financial institutions that do business directly with the Fed -- who answered the poll, only five see the Fed raising interest rates from the current range of zero to 0.25 percent in the first half of 2012. Six of 18 primary dealers called for the Fed to boost rates in the first half of 2012 in a similar poll conducted on June 3. None of the 19 primary dealers surveyed in the poll are forecasting the Fed to boost rates any time this year. The poll was conducted on Wednesday after the Fed, as widely expected, said it will keep interest rates at exceptionally low levels for an "extended period." The central bank at the end of a two-day policy meeting also cut forecasts for economic growth and acknowledged some quickening of inflation. "The most important thing was the downgrading of the 2012 forecast -- it would seem to suggest there are longer-lasting constraints on the economy which suggests the Fed could stay on hold for a longer period of time," said Mike Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities in New York. "It gets me thinking that it's more likely I'm going to have to revise down my projected start of tightening rather than moving it forward," Moran said. The Fed for over two years has maintained it will hold rates at exceptionally low levels for an "extended period," since it adopted the language in its policy statement at a March 18, 2009 meeting. The Fed cut interest rates to the zero to 0.25 percent range from 1 percent in December 2008. While the Fed noted on Wednesday inflation had risen, it said the increase was expected to be transitory. "They downgraded their growth estimates maybe slightly more than we expected. They seemed to take pains to suggest the rise in inflation is temporary. If anything, this confirms the Fed is entering into a policy holding pattern," said Jay Feldman, economist at Credit Suisse in New York. Fed fund futures, a gauge of expectations for the Fed rate, do not fully price in a rate of 0.25 percent until May, 2012. In mid-February, the fed fund futures market was pricing in a rate of 0.25 percent as early as September of this year. "Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke was pretty explicit (on Wednesday) that they are adopting a wait and see approach, and Bernanke mentioned that we are still some years away from full employment, and that suggests that we will probably be here with rates at this level for a while," said Ryan Wang, U.S. economist at HSBC Securities USA in New York.
