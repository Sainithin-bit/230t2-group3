 LISBON  (Reuters) - Portugal's new prime minister, Pedro Passos Coelho, flew economy class to his first EU summit on Thursday, saying he wanted to set an example of moderation as his country battles a debt crisis. 

 Passos Coelho was elected on June 5 and his center-right coalition government took over from the minority Socialist administration earlier this week. The previous government's collapse in March exacerbated Portugal's crisis, forcing it to follow Greece and Ireland in requesting a bailout. In remarks broadcast by Portuguese TV channels, Passos Coelho told reporters in Brussels that he flew economy. "That's what will always happen on my flights within Europe. It's about setting an example, and I'll stick to that," he said. When asked if the rule applied to all his government, Passos Coelho said: "Certainly." Unlike many European leaders, Portuguese premiers do not use a government plane but previously top-ranking officials used to fly business or first class. Portugal last month received the first tranches of 78 billion euros in rescue loans under its bailout program agreed with the European Union and the International Monetary Fund. Passos Coelho said earlier he was confident the program will be a success in Portugal. (Reporting by Andrei Khalip; Editing by  Angus MacSwan )
