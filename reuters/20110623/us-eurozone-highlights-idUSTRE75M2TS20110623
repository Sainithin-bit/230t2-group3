 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - European Union leaders are expected to press Greece at a summit on Thursday to adopt deeply unpopular austerity measures, in return for fresh financial support. 

 Following are highlights of comments before the two-day EU summit begins: EU ECONOMIC AND MONETARY AFFAIRS COMMISSIONER OLLI REHN ON MESSAGE FROM EU LEADERS TO GREECE: "Certainly Greece will be discussed today in the European Council and I would expect the European Council will reiterate the messages of the Eurogroup and the Commission by underlining the importance of adopting the medium term fiscal strategy and the privatization program before the end of June and also facilitating a broader, cross-party consensus in Greece." ON INCENTIVES FOR GREECE TO ADOPT THE AUSTERITY PACKAGE: "The incentive is that we are working together with Greece in order to help to reform the country and President (Jose Manuel) Barroso yesterday, in the name of the Commission, made an important imitative on frontloading 1 billion euros in structural funds. "That shows the EU is concerned about growth in Greece and ready to support growth in Greece, but the first thing is that Greece must help itself so that the other Europeans can help Greece. That's the bottom line." ON VOLUNTARY DEBT ROLLOVER, AND POSSIBILITY THAT RATINGS AGENCIES MIGHT CALL IT A DEFAULT: "There are different interpretations of this. It is very clear that the European Union is working on the basis of a Vienna-style initiative -- a voluntary rollover of bonds so that it will not create a credit event. "This work is going on in a decentralized manner and I trust it will yield positive results, both in terms of substantial participation of the private sector and by avoiding a credit event." ASKED ABOUT POSSIBILITY THAT IF MARKET RATES NOT OFFERED IN A ROLLOVER IT WILL BE CLASSIFIED AS A DEFAULT: "We are working on a solution which is based on a voluntary rollover and I expect it will not create a credit event."
