 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - The European Union's top economics official said on Thursday he expected a summit of EU leaders to back euro zone finance ministers' approach to dealing with the Greek financial crisis. 

 "Certainly Greece will be discussed today in the European Council and I would expect the European Council will reiterate the messages of the Eurogroup and the Commission by underlining the importance of adopting the medium term fiscal strategy and the privatization program before the end of June and also facilitating a broader, cross-party consensus in Greece," EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn told reporters.
