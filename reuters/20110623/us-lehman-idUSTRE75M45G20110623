 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Federal bankruptcy court approved on Thursday a settlement between the Lehman Brothers brokerage and JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ) in which the bank will return more than $800 million of cash and securities to resolve claims brought by the Lehman trustee. 

 The brokerage, which was part of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEHMQ.PK, is being liquidated by trustee James Giddens, who is collecting assets to return to customers who held accounts at Lehman when it filed for bankruptcy in September 2008. The trustee had announced the settlement in April. JPMorgan was the brokerage's "clearing" bank, acting as a go-between in Lehman dealings with other parties and, in that role, holding various Lehman assets. "This is a significant and positive result from two years of investigation and close cooperation with JPMorgan," Giddens said in an emailed statement The case is In re: Lehman Brothers Inc, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York, No. 08-01420.
