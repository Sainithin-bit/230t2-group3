 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - European Union leaders pressed Greece at a summit on Thursday to adopt deeply unpopular austerity measures, in return for fresh financial support. 

 Following are highlights of comments after the first day of the two-day EU summit: GREEK PRIME MINISTER GEORGE PAPANDREOU "It's a difficult course for Greece, many sacrifices, but one which will bring a viable economy and a stable economy and we've got the support of our partners and I think this was a green light but also a positive sign for the future of Greece." EUROPEAN COUNCIL PRESIDENT HERMAN VAN ROMPUY ON CURRENT AND FUTURE BAILOUT FUNDS: "Even if these are difficult and worrisome days, we are strengthening the groundwork of the economic and monetary union. "In particular, we endorsed the amended text on the European Financial Stability Facility and the treaty text of the European Stability Mechanism, the permanent safety net for the future."
