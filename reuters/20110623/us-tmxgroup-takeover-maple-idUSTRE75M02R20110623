 (Reuters) - Maple Group, an all-Canadian consortium formed to bid on TMX Group, raised its offer to buy the Canadian exchange operator late on Wednesday, hours after rival bidder The London Stock Exchange sweetened its offer. 

 Under the increased terms, the Maple Group offered to pay $50 a share and is increasing the number of shares to be purchased for cash under the offer to a maximum of 80 percent of the TMX Group's shares. The increased cash purchase price will be funded entirely by additional proportional equity investments by the Maple shareholders. (Reporting by Jochelle Mendonca in Bangalore)
