 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - The warning lights are flashing red on the euro zone's debt crisis, Jean-Claude Trichet, head of Europe's new super-watchdog and European Central Bank President said on Wednesday. 

 "On a personal basis I would say it is red," Trichet told reporters when asked what color the European Systemic Risk Board's traffic light warning system was displaying in relation to the debt turmoil. "The message of the board is that it is the most serious threat to financial stability." Private bondholders will be asked to commit to rolling over their Greek bonds when they mature, but Trichet said the potential shape of a private sector-included rollover of Greek debt was not discussed at the meeting. Links between highly indebted countries and the banking sector represent the biggest threat to financial stability in Europe, Trichet also said. "The most serious threat to financial stability in the EU stems from the interplay between the vulnerabilities of public finances in certain EU member states and the banking system, with potential contagion effects across the Union and beyond," he said. "The difficulties in program implementation in some countries pose a significant challenge for the financial system." Europe kept the pressure on Greece to push forward with a painful austerity program on Wednesday after the government jumped a crucial hurdle in averting the euro zone's first debt default by surviving a confidence vote. Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou aims to get parliamentary approval for a package of spending cuts, tax hikes and state asset sales by June 28 and implement it by July 3 to secure 12 billion euros ($17 billion) in aid that is vital to avoid immediate bankruptcy. The ESRB is designed to take a bird's eye view of Europe's financial system and flag up any emerging problems for relevant authorities to act on. It opened for business at the start of the year, billed as one of Europe's main responses to avoid a repeat of the recent financial crisis. It has no formal teeth, although if it is not satisfied with authorities' reactions, it has the option of going public with its fears. Head of the European Banking Authority, Andrea Enria, told the news conference that banks would disclose the full size of their sovereign exposure by maturity in banking sector stress tests.
