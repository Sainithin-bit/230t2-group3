 TAIPEI  (Reuters) - Four Taiwan groups have been invited by AIG ( AIG.N ) to examine the U.S. firm's Nan Shan Life unit from Monday, kicking off the sale of AIG's Taiwan unit again, a local newspaper reported on Saturday. 

 Potential buyers Cathay Financial Holding ( 2882.TW ), Fubon Financial Holding ( 2881.TW ), Chinatrust Financial Holding ( 2891.TW ) and a consortium led by a Taiwan businessman would do due diligence on Nan Shan before they can reach a deal, the Commercial Times said, citing unidentified sources. Officials from these financial companies were not available for comment, while the paper said last week that AIG aims to sell Nan Shan in two months for around $2 billion [ID:nTOE6AA0CO], as it continues to repay its bailout debt to the U.S. government. The bailed-out insurer has repeatedly said it is evaluating its options on Nan Shan. Analysts said it is more likely that Nan Shan will be sold rather the other choices of a share market listing or AIG keeping hold of the unit. Taiwan regulators in August blocked a $2.15 billion bid for Nan Shan from battery maker China Strategic ( 0235.HK ) and Primus Financial, saying the two did not have experience in the insurance industry and lacked the ability to raise capital for future operations. Companies that have since expressed interest in buying Nan Shan since include Chinatrust Financial, Fubon Financial and Primus. Nan Shan is Taiwan's No.3 life insurer by market share and its policyholders make up almost a sixth of the island's population. (Reporting by Baker Li; Editing by  Nick Macfie )
