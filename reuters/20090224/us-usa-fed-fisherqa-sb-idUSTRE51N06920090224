 CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS  (Reuters) - Policies that allow financial institutions to become too big to fail are problematic, Richard Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said on Monday, adding that he would prefer any bank interventions to be short-term. 

 "Too big to fail is not a policy, it is a problem," Fisher said in response to audience questions after giving a speech at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government. Asked about bank nationalizations, Fisher said he personally believes the government shouldn't be involved in private business. He added that governments should always have an exit strategy from any interventions that "can be realizable very quickly." He said the headquarters of insurer American International Group ( AIG.N ), which was rescued twice last year by the U.S. government, were run "like a large hedge fund." Answering a separate question, Fisher, who is not a voting member on the Fed's policy-setting committee this year, said the velocity of money had gone down and needs to be monitored.
