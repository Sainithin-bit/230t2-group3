 CHRISTIANSTED, U.S. Virgin Islands  (Reuters) - Texas billionaire Allen Stanford, charged by U.S. securities regulators with an $8 in billion fraud, has purchased at least $31 billion worth of property and leased 37 acres of land for $805,462.50 per year on the Caribbean island of St. Croix. 

 Following is a list of some Stanford assets on St. Croix, according to public records: * R. Allen Stanford purchased seven residential properties on Recovery Hill and Mount Welcome just outside Christiansted totaling $11.5 million. * One of them, known locally as the Kaiser Estate, had three houses and a conference center, according to the realtor who sold it to him. According to her and other sources, the financier had plans to tear down the existing buildings and rebuild them. But the Department of Planning and Natural Resources stopped work on the site due to "environmental violations". * Stanford Real Estate Acquisition paid $7.7 million for a mansion at the corner of Hill Street and Queen Street in Christiansted. Stanford purchased the sprawling 18th century house, known as the Bjerget House, last year at an auction related to the bankruptcy of its former owner, Jeffrey Prosser and his Innovative Communication Corp. Once owned by the Danish pianist and comedian Victor Borge, the lavish estate is where Stanford Caribbean Investments and Stanford Financial Group Global Management are based, according to the Virgin Islands Chamber of Commerce. * Stanford Real Estate Acquisition spent another $4 million on various other properties in areas called Recovery Welcome, Green Cay, Judith's Fancy, and Candle Reef. *Stanford's Christiansted Downtown Holdings invested in $7.8 million of commercial property in downtown Christiansted including "Kings Alley", a charming cobblestoned shopping arcade, and much of Strand Street, home to restaurants, cafes and other tourist-friendly shops.
