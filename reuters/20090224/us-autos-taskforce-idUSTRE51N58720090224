 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - An Obama administration task force is carefully analyzing restructuring plans of General Motors Corp and Chrysler LLC, but bankruptcy is not the panel's goal for them, a U.S. senator said on Tuesday. 

 Democrat Carl Levin of Michigan, home state of the major U.S. automakers, met with task force members Steven Rattner and Ron Bloom on the turnaround plans submitted by GM and Chrysler, which included requests for $22 billion more in bailout money. Levin said task force members, from the White House and Treasury Department, do not want to exclude options, but he stressed that bankruptcy is not the scenario they want to pursue. "They indicated very clearly that that is not their goal," Levin told Reuters. The Bush administration approved a $17.4 billion rescue in December to help carry the companies financially through the end of March. Levin and fellow Michigan Democratic senator Debbie Stabenow, who also met with Rattner and Bloom, said in separate sessions with reporters that the task force is methodically analyzing options for both GM and Chrysler. Stabenow said the task force is in a "fact-finding mode." In addition, Stabenow said auto suppliers, also hoping for federal aid to turn their operations around, had a "very good meeting" with the task force this week. Separately, car dealers, stuck with vehicles they cannot sell, warned Treasury that thousands of dealers will face financial hardship -- including potential closure -- without immediate government intervention to help finance floorplans. GM and Chrysler were asked to submit cost estimates of a Chapter 11 filing in their turnaround plans submitted to the Treasury on February 17. GM said its analysis of the costs and risks of a court reorganization would require more than $100 billion in financing that could have to be funded by the government. Outside advisers to the Treasury are exploring debtor financing options with private lenders, a Treasury official has said, but no decisions have been made. Management at both companies dismiss the option as unworkable but some analysts and restructuring experts, as well as industry skeptics, believe a court reorganization may be the only way to turn around the companies. Levin said he discussed with Rattner and Bloom approaches for persuading bondholders "to make some sacrifices" regarding efforts to swap a sizable amount of debt for equity -- a sticking point in overall efforts to win concessions. Levin did not elaborate. The panel began work last week and Rattner was appointed on Monday. Rattner and Bloom provide the task force with investment and restructuring expertise. Rattner headed private equity firm Quadrangle Group LLC, while Bloom has worked on restructuring matters for years with the United Steelworkers union. He also has Wall Street experience. Stabenow said GM and Chrysler top executives would meet with task force members this week to discuss their business plans. Officials of both companies would not confirm that the meetings had been scheduled. Under terms of the December bailout, Chrysler and GM must show by March 31 that they can be competitive and worthy of more federal aid.
