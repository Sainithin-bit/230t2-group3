 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Lawmakers in Connecticut, a state home to hundreds of hedge fund firms, have proposed tougher oversight for an industry tarnished by market losses, the Madoff scandal and client redemptions. 

 State legislators recently introduced three bills that would bring changes to the state's longstanding hands-off approach, according to a letter the Connecticut Hedge Fund Association sent to its members on Tuesday and obtained by Reuters. Association officials were not immediately available for comment. Hearings on the bills are scheduled for February 27 at the state capital in Hartford. Lawmakers want hedge funds to obtain a state license, provide for an independent annual financial audit, disclose fees and report significant changes in their management or investment strategy. One bill would bar investments in hedge funds from people with less than $2.5 million in assets or from institutions with less than $5 million in assets. After New York and London, Connecticut towns like Greenwich, Stamford and Westport combined represent the third largest hedge fund hub, with nearly 10 percent of the world's fund assets, according to analysts. Famed investors such as Pequot Capital, Tudor Investment Corp and SAC Capital are based in the state. Hedge funds are under the gun after a year in which the industry saw managed assets fall by one-half to about $1 trillion due to a combination of jarring losses and a surge in redemptions. Hedge funds also have been blamed for exacerbating the financial crisis by shorting troubled banks through the stock and credit-default-swap markets. Also, authorities accused investment manager Bernard Madoff of running a $50 billion Ponzi scheme, raising new questions about the absence of industry oversight. Madoff attracted investments from funds of hedge funds. Hedge funds, which historically were lightly regulated because only the very rich could invest in them, are today a political issue because employee pensions, charities and endowments have been hammered by losses.
