 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Citigroup on Monday said it named Farhan Faruqui head of Asia Pacific Global Banking, as part of its move to merge the corporate and investment banking groups across the region, including Japan. 

 Mark Renton, Citi's former head of Asia Pacific investment banking, is now co-head of Citi's public sector group. Asia-based investment bankers inside and outside of Citi had been wondering which of the two would emerge in the top spot. Faruqui, an 18-year Citi veteran, was the bank's former head of Asia Pacific Corporate & Commercial Bank. He will report to Ajay Banga, CEO Citi Asia Pacific, and also to Alberto Verme and Raymond McGuire, co-heads of global banking. Renton, at Citi for more than 20 years, will remain in Hong Kong and report to Verme and McGuire. His public sector role will focus on providing advice to governments throughout the region.
