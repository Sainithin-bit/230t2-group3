 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Prices on U.S. single-family homes dropped a record 4.5 percent last quarter from a year earlier, though the pace of depreciation slowed, the Federal Housing Finance Agency said on Tuesday. 

 The FHFA index that measures loan refinancings and home sales, which includes data back to 1975, dipped 0.2 percent in the latest quarter, the regulator said in a statement. Its monthly house price index, however, edged up 0.1 percent in December from November. "Price declines continued in the fourth quarter, although not as rapidly as some had expected," James Lockhart, director of the FHFA, said in the statement. The regulator's indexes contrast sharply with another set of price measures from Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller, which on Tuesday said price declines accelerated in December after sliding 18.2 percent last quarter from a year earlier. The S&P index covers 20 metropolitan regions, including those where the housing slump has been most pronounced. The FHFA gauge is national, but excludes the riskiest loans since it is limited to mortgages eligible for federal guarantee programs of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The FHFA's index measuring only home purchases was more in line with the S&P data, falling a record 3.4 percent in the fourth quarter, exceeding the 2 percent drop in the previous three-month period. On the year, the purchase-only index fell 8.2 percent, the FHFA said. (Reporting by  Al Yoon ; editing by Gary Crosse)
