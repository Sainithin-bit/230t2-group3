 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The commodity index business jointly operated by Dow Jones and American International Group Inc is performing as usual in spite of reports of fresh financial woes at insurer AIG, a spokeswoman for the index said on Monday. 

 "Our business is on an usual," Naomi Kim, public relations manager (North America) for Dow Jones Indexes, said, referring to the DJ-AIG Commodity Index. "There's no change to that as of now," Kim told Reuters. AIG sponsors and manages the DJ-AIG Commodity Index. A source told Reuters earlier on Monday that AIG expects to report a fourth-quarter loss of about $60 billion, but has no plans to file for bankruptcy. The insurer was is in talks with the U.S. government for further help that could include additional funds and trading debt for equity, said the source who is familiar with the matter.
