 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. banks need enough high-quality capital to weather a worse-than-expected recession, and stress tests will help regulators determine how much, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Tuesday. 

 In testimony to the Senate Banking Committee, Bernanke said the major U.S. banks all meet current regulatory standards, but they may need different types of capital cushions, including more common stock, to ensure that they can keep lending even if conditions worsen dramatically. "We want to make sure that they have good quality capital and that a sufficient portion of their capital is in common stock and not in other forms of capital," he said. Regulators will begin a closer examination of banks on Wednesday to get a sense of how they would hold up should the economy take a turn for the worse, driving up loan losses and unemployment even more than economists now expect. Bernanke said it was not a matter of firms passing or failing these stress tests. Rather, the tests were a way of assessing what level and type of capital each firm needed to keep on hand in order to maintain normal lending. "The purpose of the test is to try to ensure that even in a bad scenario, banks will have enough capital -- including enough common equity -- to meet their obligation to lend," he said. Regulators said on Monday that if the stress testing shows firms need more capital, they can first try to raise it in the private sector and then seek government assistance in the form of preferred shares that convert into common stock.
