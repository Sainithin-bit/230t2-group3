 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - RadioShack ( RSH.N ) posted weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings, as recession-weary consumers curbed spending on electronics and sending its shares down more than 12 percent. 

 The retail chain attributed its profit decline to weak sales of gadgets such as satellite navigation systems and smaller profits from mobile phone sales. In recent years, RadioShack has shut unprofitable stores and cut staff but it remains challenged by rivals such as Best Buy Co ( BBY.N ) and Wal-Mart Stores ( WMT.N ). Net income fell 39 percent to $62.0 million, or 50 cents a share, from $101.0 million, or 77 cents a share last year. Analysts on average had expected a profit of 73 cents a share before special items, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales fell 7.7 percent to $1.3 billion. RadioShack said kiosk sales fell 2.2 percent. Comparable same-store sales for company-operated stores and kiosks fell 9.2 percent during the quarter. "Our financial results for the fourth quarter obviously reflect the recessionary retail trading environment we face," said RadioShack Chief Executive Julian Day in a statement. RadioShack said slack sales of GPS devices, memory players, and imaging products -- which typically includes cameras and printers -- were offset somewhat by strength in digital television converter boxes, mobile phone contracts, flat-panel televisions and laptop computers. Its profit margin was hurt as it cut prices to help sell slow-moving seasonal inventory. Profits were also pinched in its postpaid mobile phone business as more customers chose to upgrade, rather than sign on for new activations which are more profitable. Despite the demise of gadget retailer Circuit City, RadioShack, which runs 4,400 company-operated stores, and operates 2,300 other locations, still faces stiff competition from market leader Best Buy, which has expanded its mobile-phone departments and added standalone shops, as well as discounter Wal-Mart, which has stepped up its offerings. RadioShack expects capital expenditure for 2009 to be $75 million to $100 million. It had spent $85.6 million in 2008. Shares of RadioShack slipped to $9.52 in pre-market trade on Tuesday, after closing at $10.82 Monday on the New York Stock Exchange.
