 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve Board on Tuesday said banks should cut dividends as earnings fall and that it will discourage institutions receiving federal rescue funds from using the money to pay dividends on trust preferred securities or to repay debt obligations. 

 In a guidance letter on dividend policy to the 12 Federal Reserve banks, the Fed said bank supervisors should increase scrutiny on dividends, especially for those that receive funds from the U.S. Treasury's Capital Purchase Program. Bank holding companies "should reduce or eliminate dividends when the quantity and quality of the (firm's) earnings have declined or the (firm) is experiencing other financial problems or when the macroeconomic outlook for the bank holding company's primary profit centers has deteriorated."
