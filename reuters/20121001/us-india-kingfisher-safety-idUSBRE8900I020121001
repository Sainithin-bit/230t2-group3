 NEW DELHI  (Reuters) - Ailing Indian carrier Kingfisher Airlines ( KING.NS ) will not be allowed to fly if safety rules are not followed, Civil Aviation Minister Ajit Singh said, after labor unrest forced the carrier to cancel its flights on Monday. 
 Singh said the civil aviation regulator will meet Kingfisher executives on Tuesday. He said the airline had canceled all its flights thus far on Monday. (Reporting by  Anurag Kotoky ; Editing by  Tony Munroe )
