 JAKARTA  (Reuters) - PT Bakrie & Brothers ( BNBR.JK ), the investment arm of Indonesia's Bakrie Group, and affiliate Long Haul Holdings have agreed with creditors a plan to repay $437 million of debt arranged by Credit Suisse ( CSGN.VX ), the firm said on Monday. 
 However, the company did not elaborate on how it will repay the debt, which uses the Bakrie Group's 23.8 percent stake in London-listed coal miner Bumi Plc ( BUMIP.L ) as collateral. In June, the Bakrie Group, whose scion Aburizal Bakrie has his sights on getting elected as Indonesia's president in 2014, asked creditors for more time to resolve a mid-April covenant breach on the loan.
