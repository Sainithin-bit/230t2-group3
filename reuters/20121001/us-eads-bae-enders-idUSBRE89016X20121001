 LONDON  (Reuters) - EADS ( EAD.PA ) Chief Executive Tom Enders called for negotiators to resolve uncertainty as soon as possible over a planned $45 billion merger with BAE Systems ( BAES.L ). 
 Speaking after a day of mounting criticism and rhetoric about the proposal to create a new European defense giant, Enders said the next 10 days in the run-up to an October 10 UK regulatory deadline would be crucial. "We intend to come to a conclusion very soon ... We cannot go on much longer," he told an audience at the Royal Academy of Engineering in London. EADS board chairman Arnaud Lagardere, whose Lagardere ( LAGA.PA ) media company is a core shareholder, called on the management to review the merger plan earlier on Monday, but Enders insisted the board strongly supported the proposal.
