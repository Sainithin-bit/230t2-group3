 LONDON  (Reuters) - Activist investor Knight Vinke Asset Management, a top 20 investor in Xstrata XTA.L, has criticized the miner's non-executive directors for failing to demonstrate sufficient independence in its protracted merger talks with trader Glencore ( GLEN.L ). 
 The New York-based investment firm said the "merger of equals" recommended by Xstrata's board on Monday would in reality effect a change of control, with CEO Mick Davis replaced by Glencore's Ivan Glasenberg. Knight Vinke said it would consult other investors with a view to taking steps to strengthen the board's independence. (Reporting by  Sinead Cruise , editing by Laurence Fletcher)
