 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Greece's international lenders have demanded additional details on Athens' proposals in an austerity package worth nearly 12 billion euros, the finance minister said on Monday. 
 "There are discussions on the measures. The troika wants clarifications," Yannis Stournaras told reporters after the latest round of talks between the government and its European Union and IMF lenders. (Reporting by George Georgiopoulos)
