 BEIJING  (Reuters) - A think tank at People's University has 
forecast China's economic growth will slow to about 9.25 
percent in 2007 and remain near that rate through 2010, the 
Beijing News reported on Sunday. 

  In its first macroeconomic report, the university's 
Economic Research Institute predicted China's gross domestic 
product (GDP) would pull back from projected annual growth of 
about 10.48 percent this year in response to government cooling 
measures.  The estimates for 2006 and 2007 were roughly in line with a 
range of recent economic forecasts from various economists 
polled by Reuters.  "Judging from the medium and long-term views, the 
macro-economy of China will end its prosperity stage of this 
economic cycle, but there will be no deflation or stagnancy," 
said Liu Yuanchun, an analyst at the institute who prepared the 
report.  The researchers predicted consumer inflation would be 1.5 
percent in 2006 while annual fixed-asset investment growth 
would hold near 27 percent.  At a briefing to release the report on Saturday, Wu 
Xiaoling, vice governor of China's central bank, praised the 
report for its "high quality," the newspaper said.  Liu predicted that annual GDP growth in the fourth quarter 
will be 9.62 percent, down from 10.4 percent in the third 
quarter and 11.3 percent in the second quarter.  "If the current stable financial and monetary policies can 
be maintained and the government adopts some selective 
contraction policies, then the national economic growth will 
keep the trends of the second half of this year, and the GDP 
growth rate next year will drop to 9.25 percent," he said.  The report projected annual GDP growth would remain 
slightly higher than 9 percent through 2010.
