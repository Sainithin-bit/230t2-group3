 LONDON  (Reuters) - Takeover target London Stock Exchange ( LSE.L ) is preparing to cut its prices to compete with a rival shareholding platform being set up by seven investment banks, The Sunday Telegraph said. 

 LSE, which last week rejected a 2.7 billion pound ($5.2 billion) offer from Nasdaq ( NDAQ.O ), agreed the deep discounts in several carefully targeted trading areas in early November, the paper said, quoting a source that had seen the plan. It is understood the reductions are likely to reach further than previous volume discounts at Europe's largest share market, the paper reported. "We have been bringing down the cost of trading over the last few years and we would expect to continue to do so. One of the reasons why is because every time we have we have seen an increase in trading activity," an LSE spokeswoman told Reuters on Sunday. On November 15 Citigroup ( C.N ), Credit Suissse ( CSGN.VX ), Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ), Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ), Merrill Lynch MER.N, Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) and UBS ( UBSN.VX ) said they planned to create a new pan-European trading platform next year. The seven investment banks -- which account for almost half of the exchange trading in European equities as well as being dominant players in off-exchange trading -- said their rival platform would take advantage of new European rules that come into force next November. The European Unions' Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) hopes to create a pan-European market in financial services that will ensure customers get value for money and greater transparency. Shares in LSE, which have virtually doubled since the start of the year, closed at 1,321 pence on Friday.
