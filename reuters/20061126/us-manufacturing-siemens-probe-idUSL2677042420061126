 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - State prosecutors want to talk to Siemens ( SIEGn.DE ) chief executive Klaus Kleinfeld as part of a probe into suspected fraud at the German industrial conglomerate, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Saturday. 

 The source said Kleinfeld would be questioned as a witness rather than someone suspected of wrongdoing. During a series of recent raids earlier this month, investigators entered the offices of Kleinfeld and numerous employees. "When someone's office is searched then he would afterwards be questioned as a witness," the source told Reuters. A spokesman for Siemens said it had not yet received such a request. Last week, the Munich state prosecutor said it was probing the disappearance of about 200 million euros ($257 million) from Siemens' accounts. The prosecutors said they had detained six people in connection with the matter and were questioning them about whether they moved Siemens' money illegally into foreign accounts. During raids, investigators seized between 200 and 300 files with documents relating to current business and a further roughly 36,000 archive files. Both the prosecutors and Siemens have already said that Kleinfeld could be a witness but was not a suspect.
