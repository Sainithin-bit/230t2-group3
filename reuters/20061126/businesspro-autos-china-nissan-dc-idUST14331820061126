 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co. plans to develop and 
start selling subcompact electric cars powered by 
self-developed lithium-ion batteries in about three years, the 
Nihon Keizai (Nikkei) business daily reported on Sunday. 

  Japan's number-two automaker also plans to develop and sell 
gas-electric hybrid cars by 2010 in an attempt to catch up with 
rivals Honda Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. in the field of 
eco-friendly vehicles, Nikkei said.  In co-operation with its French partner Renault SA, Nissan 
will speed up the expansion of its line-up of diesel cars, that 
are in growing demand globally, Nikkei said.  Nissan will also strive to develop bioethanol cars with the 
help of Renault, Nikkei said, adding that the Japanese 
automaker would provide Renault with fuel cell and hybrid car 
technologies.  Company officials were not immediately available for 
comment.
