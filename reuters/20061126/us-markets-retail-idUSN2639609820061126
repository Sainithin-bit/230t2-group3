 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks may not extend their recent rally much further this year, even though the holiday shopping season took off with a busy start as retailers lured consumers with deep discounts. 

 Retail shares have already bounced back from mid-July lows and are currently up more than 10 percent year to date. The broader equity market is also up sharply from mid-year, with all three major U.S. stock indexes -- the Nasdaq Composite  .IXIC  the Standard & Poor's 500  .SPX  and the Dow Jones Industrial Average  .DJI  -- racking up double-digit gains. "There is not a lot of room for disappointment, and upside gains will probably be modest, even on really strong data," said Peter Dunay, investment strategist at Leeb Capital Management in New York. Most data has yet to be reported this early in the season, and investors and analysts are relying more on anecdotal reports of store traffic and item availability. Starting on Friday, many retailers opened before dawn to get a jump on the season, and shoppers lined up in parking lots in hopes of snagging hot items and special offers. But long lines are no sure indicator of good earnings, analysts said. "The question is, do people have lots of spare cash, thanks to low gas prices? Or does this mean that money is a little tight, and they are camping out to get the deals because they are little nervous?" said Barry Ritholtz, fund manager at Ritholtz Capital Partners in New York. On Saturday, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ), the world's biggest retailer, estimated that November sales fell 0.1 percent at U.S. stores open at least a year -- a closely watched retail measure known as same-store sales. This would represent Wal-Mart's first monthly same-store sales decline since April 1996. "You can't argue that it is a Wal-Mart-specific problem because in essence Wal-Mart is a pretty good representation of the whole economy," said Anthony Chan, chief economist at JPMorgan Private Client Services in New York. "Wal-Mart should never be treated as an isolated case. They are too big. They are the 800-pound gorilla in retail you can't ignore." On a more positive note, department store chain J.C. Penney Co. Inc. ( JCP.N ) said its holiday season was off to a good start, with brisk foot traffic. But Penney shares may not move much higher on the news, after gaining a hefty 28 percent since September. Meanwhile, Wal-Mart stock is up a little more than 7 percent since August 31. Staples Inc. ( SPLS.O ), the No. 1 office supplies retailer, said Sunday that traffic and sales exceeded expectations, helped by deeper inventory and efforts to make shopping easy. Its stock is up 12.8 percent year to date. "Online and in-store traffic and dollar spending were very strong, right out of the chute," said Dave Perron, Staples' executive vice president of merchandising and supply chain. "There were strong increases in both from last year." Retailers who have endured the lowest expectations this year may be the season's winners. Visa USA, the largest U.S. credit card association, said in a statement on Sunday that home furnishings had the best year-over-year Black Friday growth despite the sharp slowdown in the housing market. J.C. Penney said home entertainment and housewares were among its strongest selling categories over the weekend. Overall, clothing, accessories and books, CDs and DVDs were the most popular items, according to the National Retail Federation (NRF), which expects holiday sales growth of about 5 percent, a slowdown from last year's surprisingly strong 6.1 percent gain. The NRF said Sunday that traffic to stores over the three-day holiday weekend was below last year's levels -- approximately 140 million shoppers versus 145 million -- but found the average shopper spent 19 percent more than last year. "It's the higher-priced items that are going to drive sales. People are feeling like they're not going to buy as much, but the ticket price on what they're buying is going up," said Marc Pado, U.S. market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in San Francisco. Analysts will get more concrete data on the health of the holiday shopping season on Thursday, when most major chain stores report their November figures. Wal-Mart will also give a final monthly sales report. (Additional reporting by  Martinne Geller  and  Alexandria Sage )
