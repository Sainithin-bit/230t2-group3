 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ), the world's biggest car maker, reported its best operating profit in two years, beating market estimates, and lifted its cautious forecasts despite a sluggish U.S. recovery and a stronger yen. 

 KEY POINTS: -- Toyota reported an operating profit for the April-June quarter of 211.7 billion yen ($2.47 billion) against a loss of 194.9 billion yen a year ago. It beat the average 146 billion estimated by six analysts surveyed by Reuters. -- Toyota's new guidance for operating profit to total 330 billion yen in the year to March 31, 2011, is still far short of a consensus 526.5 billion yen in a survey of 21 analysts by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. -- First-quarter net profit, which includes earnings made in China, was 190.5 billion yen, compared with a loss of 77.8 billion yen a year earlier. -- Toyota said it expects the dollar to average 90 yen and the euro 112 yen this business year. The dollar was around 85.40 yen and the euro 112.80 yen on Wednesday. COMMENTARY: TATSUO YOSHIDA, AUTO ANALYST, UBS SECURITIES, TOKYO "Their upward revision was a bit wanting, but that in itself was factored in. The first quarter was far better than expectations, so that's positive. "For Toyota, there's a lot of weight on Japan and North America, so a slowdown in the recovery in U.S. sales is especially a risk for them." RICHARD LIN, ANALYST, UNI-PRESIDENT ASSET MANAGEMENT, TAIPEI "Toyota is losing out to rivals in the U.S. and Chinese markets due to its recall earlier. Its growth momentum is not as strong as that of Nissan, Hyundai and BMW. "Investors should be cautious about Japanese auto stocks because of the rising yen. Toyota shares, in particular, are most under pressure. "Auto demand in the U.S. market is picking up steadily, but demand in the Chinese market is slowing down. Its inventory has risen to more than 50 days recently, compared with about 30 days last year." The fund does not have any holdings of Toyota stock, Lin said. Its Asia-Pacific fund recently sold its Toyota shares. DAVID HUO, FUND MANAGER, RBC ASIAN EQUITY FUND, HONG KONG "It had better than expected earnings, way better ... "They revised up the guidance, that was good, and the amazing thing is they still assume 90 yen per U.S. dollar, which is to me somehow aggressive, as many exporters changed their assumption to 85, so I think 90 is aggressive. "The revision on full-year guidance, in terms of unit volume, is conservative. "At least their assumption of unit shipments to me is not aggressive. I agree it's conservative. "I don't see a near-term recovery in the share price in a big way because of the U.S. litigation ... It put a lid on the possible upside. "You have to be patient and prepared for long-term investment. I still believe Toyota is one of the world's best automakers. They made mistakes but they are in the process in correcting the mistake, so I think this valuation below one times price-to-book is very cheap. But still in the near term I don't expect any significant upside. Near term could be the whole summer, until after September. "In the U.S., they still have to improve. They are relatively underperforming." HIROAKI OSAKABE, FUND MANAGER, CHIBAGIN ASSET MANAGEMENT, TOKYO "The fact that they lifted their forecast is good, but it still seems a bit weak, and I wonder if this isn't a bit too conservative. It's so very different from the results they got for the first quarter that it could well be a bit too conservative. "The fact that they're keeping the currency assumption at 90 yen to the dollar is a concern. "But I do think these earnings show an uptrend. I certainly don't think there'll be any reason to sell Toyota as a result of these numbers, and probably it will become a reason to buy, especially given their upward revision for vehicle sales numbers. But the currency rate is definitely a concern given that the dollar is now below 90 yen." MITSUSHIGE AKINO, CHIEF FUND MANAGER, ICHIYOSHI INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT "The company is keeping the dollar/yen assumption unchanged while upgrading its forecast for the fiscal year. This may reflect its confidence that it can absorb currency fluctuations by cost-cutting ... "The prospect of an economic slowdown in North America is the biggest concern for Toyota ... "The market has already factored in that the company would make a conservative forecast, so the impact from the results is neutral for its share price. The yen's move is likely to have more impact on the share price." MARKET: Toyota shares closed down 1.6 percent at 3,090 yen ahead of the results announcement. The Nikkei average  .N225  fell 2.1 percent. BACKGROUND: -- Toyota has recalled more than 10 million vehicles since last September, mainly concerning unintended acceleration, including pedals that stick or become caught under floor mats. -- The U.S. government ordered Toyota in April to pay a $16.4 million fine for delaying a January recall over accelerator pedals that did not spring back as designed. -- Top Japanese and Korean automakers have been expected to report a sharp improvement in April-June earnings as car demand in major markets soared, but the coming quarters look tough due to rising commodity prices and a slowdown in sales. -- With a U.S. sales recovery looking weaker than anticipated and European consumption shaky from the region's debt crisis, many analysts said they expected automakers to paint a cautious picture for the rest of the year. Japanese scrappage incentives are also set to expire at the end of September -- a negative especially for top beneficiary Toyota. -- New vehicle sales in the United States -- traditionally a cash cow for Japan's top three brands -- grew by double-digits in April and May but slipped in June, raising doubts about the strength of the recovery predicted at the start of the year. Sales in China, the world's biggest auto market, also disappointed in June, with growth slipping below 20 percent for the first time in 14 months.
