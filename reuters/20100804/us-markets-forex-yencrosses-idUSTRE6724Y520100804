 LONDON  (Reuters) - The yen's fall against major currencies other than the dollar looks set to falter in the face of low expectations for inflation which will limit carry trades, exacerbating volatility in thin summer markets. 

 Euro/yen and sterling/yen both hit more than two-month highs last week, as equity markets rose on solid corporate earnings and eurozone and UK fundamentals continued to improve, leading to some bullish calls. Yen crosses -- its rate against majors other than the dollar -- have rallied historically when stock markets are strong and world equities rallied over 7 percent last month, according to MSCI .MIAPJ0000PUS. But rising inflation expectations are also normally required for cross-yen rallies to be maintained. "Carry trades need rising inflation expectations and in the case of euro/yen, it doesn't look as though the ECB is going to be raising rates soon," said Manuel Oliveri, currency strategist at UBS in Zurich. He felt that as a result future euro/yen direction would be dictated by what happens to the dollar's rate against the Japanese unit rather than a carry trade move related to the euro itself. Carry trades, where players borrow at the yen's low interest rates to buy assets in higher-yielding currencies, require there to be at least the expectation that interest rates in the destination currency will soon rise. Worsening prospects for the U.S. economy have also undermined that play globally. Dollar/yen hit an 8-month low on Friday on fears about slowing U.S. growth after second quarter GDP came in below expectations. "We're seeing a disconnection as U.S. data stays weak yet risk appetite is strong. Weak U.S. data will translate into risk aversion at some point," said Tom Levinson, fx strategist at ING. HIGH VOLATILITY Market players said liquidity in currency markets was very low over July and into August, making for high volatility. "Liquidity is poor at present. If our traders need to work an order it tends to move the market far more than would normally be the case. It's normally thin at this time of year but it seems to be particularly bad now," said Levinson at ING. Technical analysts had been making bullish calls on the yen crosses after the break to their recent highs, but those moves now look like false breaks. "The yen crosses are rangebound and choppy. Euro/yen made a false break to the topside but it's looking more neutral now." said Dhiren Sarin, technical analyst at Barclays Capital. He added there were no definitive signals in yen crosses though there were tentative signs that a general move into risk -- that is, bets on higher growth -- could provide some upside momentum. The Australian dollar is also within its Ichimoku cloud -- a widely-used Japanese indicator used to gauge momentum along with future areas of support and resistance -- and he said that was a positive sign. "But it's not looking like a decisive move at the moment," Sarin warned. "Resistance is the top of the cloud around 80 yen." (Editing by  Patrick Graham )
