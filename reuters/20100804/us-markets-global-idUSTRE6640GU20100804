 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Global stocks edged higher and the dollar rebounded from an eight-month low versus the yen on Wednesday after better-than-expected readings of U.S. and European economic data rekindled bets on riskier assets. 

 U.S. Treasuries fell as the U.S. data buoyed stocks, interrupting a recent rally in Treasuries that drove five-year note yields to record lows. Investors took heart after U.S. private employers added 42,000 jobs in July after an upwardly revised gain of 19,000 in June, according to payrolls processor ADP Employer Services. The vast service sectors in the United States and euro zone both grew last month, reports showed, easing some worries about a severe slowdown in the global economic recovery. MSCI's all-country world index .MIWD00000PUS pared losses to trade slightly higher, helped by solid gains from U.S. indexes. Asian indexes fell while European indices were flat or traded lower. U.S. stocks rose in thin trade as retailer earnings and the ADP jobs report boosted optimism before the Labor Department's U.S. non-farm payrolls report on Friday, which is expected to show a drop of 65,000. "People still have a lot of concerns about economic growth right now, and people are thinking the economy is slowing. These numbers haven't been strong enough to disabuse anyone of that opinion," said Stephen Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Morgan in San Francisco. "On the other hand, stocks continue to be very inexpensive, and if you believe 2011 earnings estimates, they are very inexpensive," Massocca said. The S&P 500 is trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 12.6 versus 14.6 at the start of the year. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  closed up 44.05 points, or 0.41 percent, to 10,680.43. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  added 6.78 points, or 0.61 percent, to 1,127.24. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  advanced 20.05 points, or 0.88 percent, to 2,303.57. Oil prices retreated from a three-month high in choppy trade as the rebounding dollar and weak gasoline futures weighed on crude futures after they were lifted by a government report that showed falling inventories. "It has been a tug of war with the markets today with competing bullish and bearish (news). The dollar is back up and it is putting downward pressure on crude prices," said Phil Flynn, analyst at PFGBest Research in Chicago. U.S. crude for September delivery fell 8 cents to settle at $82.47 a barrel. Front-month ICE Brent crude fell 48 cents to settle at $82.20 a barrel. The dollar rebounded from an eight-month low against the yen and rose against the euro as the U.S. data prompted traders to unwind bets against the U.S. currency. "It's obvious the pace of U.S. growth is slowing and people are waiting to sell the dollar at better levels," said Hidetoshi Yanagihara, senior currency trader at Mizuho Corporate Bank in New York. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar was up 0.50 percent at 86.26, while the euro was down 0.50 percent at $1.3164. U.S. Treasury debt prices fell. Two-year Treasury notes were trading 2/32 lower in price to yield 0.57 percent. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes were trading 10/32 lower in price to yield 2.95 percent. The five-year Treasury was at 1.61 percent after it probed record lows this week. Gold rose above $1,200 an ounce for the first time in nearly two weeks, as strong physical demand lifted the metal higher for its sixth straight daily gain. U.S. gold futures for December delivery settled up $8.40 at $1,195.90 an ounce. Copper rallied to a fresh three-month peak as risk appetite improved on the U.S. economic news. Copper for September delivery in New York rose 4.60 cents to end at $3.4045 a pound. Earlier in Asia, Tokyo stocks  .N225  fell 2.1 percent, while the MSCI Asia-Pacific index that excludes Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS was down 0.1 percent. Fears that a strong yen would erode exporters' profits and sap economic growth boosted Japanese government bonds, pushing the 10-year yield below 1 percent for the first time in seven years.
