 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - No. 2 U.S. homebuilder PulteGroup Inc ( PHM.N ) posted its first profit since 2006 and solidly beat analysts' estimates for the second quarter, sending shares up 2 percent. 

 Pulte reported a net profit of $76 million, or 20 cents per share, compared with Wall Street estimates of a loss of a penny, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The results included $82 million in benefits related to income taxes but also $45 million in charges on land and mortgages. Last year, PulteGroup posted a loss of $189.5 million, or 74 cents per share. The company had also recorded a net loss in the first quarter. Revenue almost doubled to $1.31 billion. The Bloomfield, Michigan-based company said demand had stabilized at a low level after declining following the April expiration of a U.S. tax credit for first-time homebuyers. Orders rose 25 percent to 4,218 in the quarter, flat with the first quarter. But Credit Suisse analyst Dan Oppenheim sees a 13 percent decline in orders in the third quarter due to the weakness in demand. "Our industry continues to face incredibly low demand," said Chief Executive Richard Dugas during a conference call with analysts. "Right now the industry's biggest issue is a lack of buyers." Pulte's rivals, such as No. 1 D.R. Horton Inc ( DHI.N ) and The Ryland Group Inc ( RYL.N ) reported a drop in orders in their second quarters. Pulte's shares were up 2 percent at $8.60 in mid-morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by  Helen Chernikoff  and  Scott Malone , editing by Dave Zimmerman)
