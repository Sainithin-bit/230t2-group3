 MOSCOW  (Reuters) - Russia's top oil official kissed Tony Hayward, vilified elsewhere and ousted from his job as BP CEO over the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, and hinted that Hayward's new role in Russia might lead to more golden opportunities. 

 Hayward is already due to take a seat on the board of TNK-BP, BP's 50-50 Russian joint venture. But at talks in Moscow, Deputy Prime Minister Igor Sechin, who is close to Russian Prime Minister Vladmir Putin, said more offers may be in the pipeline for Hayward. "The fact that you will continue to work on the board of TNK-BP will be a help to (new BP CEO Bob) Dudley and to us," Sechin said. "And who knows? Maybe there could be other offers in the future." Dudley, who also attended the meeting, was forced to stand down as TNK-BP's CEO and flee Russia two years ago amid a fierce war of influence with the quartet of billionaires who share control of the company with BP. It was Hayward who eventually negotiated a peace deal. (Reporting by Katya Golubkova; Writing by  Melissa Akin ; Editing by  Gary Hill )
