 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Warren Buffett's leading heir apparent at Berkshire Hathaway, David Sokol, resigned after buying shares in Lubrizol Corp, a chemical company he then pushed Buffett to buy. 

 Here is a timeline of events leading up to the $9 billion deal and Sokol's resignation. Autumn 2010: Sokol requests Citigroup investment bankers come up with a list of targets for Berkshire Hathaway. Citi gives him a list of 18 companies, including Lubrizol. Dec 13, 2010: Sokol discusses the list with Citi and says Lubrizol was the only company he found interesting. He asks a Citi representative to tell Lubrizol CEO James Hambrick that Sokol was interested in meeting to discuss a deal. Dec 14: Sokol buys 2,300 Lubrizol shares. Dec 17: Citi relays Sokol's interest to Hambrick, who says he would inform the Lubrizol board of Berkshire's interest. Dec 21: Sokol sells the Lubrizol shares. Jan 5-7, 2011: Sokol buys 96,060 Lubrizol shares after placing a 100,000-share order with a $104 per-share limit price. Jan 6: Lubrizol's board discusses a deal with Berkshire and engages Jones Day and Evercore for advice. Jan 10: Lubrizol board convenes with Jones Day and Evercore to discuss a potential Berkshire deal. The board instructs CEO Hambrick to meet with Sokol. Jan 14: Sokol and Hambrick have a general talk over the phone and set up a meeting for January 25. Jan 14 or 15: Sokol suggests buying Lubrizol to Buffett, with a "passing remark" that he owned some stock in the company. Buffett is not interested. Jan 25: Lubrizol CEO Hambrick meets with Sokol and gives him information about the chemical company, including internal forecasts for 2014 and 2015; Sokol reports the meeting to Buffett, who then warms to the acquisition. Jan 28: Evercore tells Lubrizol's board that Buffett expressed interest in the deal. Feb 8: Hambrick meets with Buffett. March 14: Berkshire announces a plan to buy Lubrizol for $135 per share. March 19: Buffett learns the details of Sokol's purchase of Lubrizol shares. March 28: Sokol's assistant delivers his letter of resignation to Buffett. Buffett says he did not ask for the resignation and that it came as a surprise. March 30: Buffett announces Sokol's resignation request. He says: "Neither Dave nor I feel his Lubrizol purchases were in any way unlawful. He has told me that they were not a factor in his decision to resign." March 31: Sokol defends himself on CNBC-TV and says he has in the past invested in businesses that he suggested that Buffett buy. April 27: Berkshire's announces that its audit committee is considering the possibility of legal action against Sokol and that it would cooperate with any government investigation. It says Sokol's "misleadingly incomplete" disclosures "violated the duty of candor" he owed to Berkshire.
