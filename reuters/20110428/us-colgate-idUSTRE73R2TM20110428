 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Colgate-Palmolive Co ( CL.N ) posted a drop in first-quarter profit before one-time items on Thursday as higher materials costs cut into margins. 

 The company earned $576 million, or $1.16 a share, compared with $357 million, or 69 cents per share, a year earlier. But the year-earlier profit was hit by a one-time charge of 52 cents a share from hyperinflation accounting in Venezuela. Excluding the charge, earnings fell 8 percent in this year's first quarter, the company said. Colgate, which has raised prices on bars of soap and other goods, said sales rose 4.5 percent to $4 billion. The company previously forecast a mid-single-digit percentage rise in earnings per share for 2011 and stood by that target on Thursday. Colgate, along with rivals such as Procter & Gamble Co ( PG.N ), is banking on growth in countries such as China and India as growth in developed markets such as the United States and Western Europe has stagnated.
