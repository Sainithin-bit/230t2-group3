 SEOUL  (Reuters) - Honda Motor ( 7267.T ) and Hyundai Motor Co ( 005380.KS ) painted vastly different pictures for the year ahead with their earnings releases on Thursday, after the March 11 earthquake hammered car production in Japan and helped overseas rivals in the process. 

 Below is a roundup of analysts' views: MITSUSHIGE AKINO, CHIEF FUND MANAGER, ICHIYOSHI INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT IN TOKYO "I think (domestic) carmakers are all the same, some will be fast in getting operating lines up and running, others will be slow, but in the end there won't be a big difference when they all are able to resume full production." YOO BYUNG-OCK, FUND MANAGER, UBS-HANA ASSET MANAGEMENT CO LTD, SEOUL "Hyundai Motor's first quarter earnings were a surprise. I have never seen such a high operating profit margin from Hyundai before. "Hyundai will be able to maximize its profit without paying additional costs as Japanese automakers will not be able to normalize production until later this year. Hyundai's profit will be sustainable this year and in the first half of next year. "The currency is a factor. But I am not that concerned about the firming won. It will not have a major impact on Hyundai's earnings as long as it stays above 1,000 won per dollar." PETER ELSTON, STRATEGIST FOR ABERDEEN ASSET MANAGEMENT, SINGAPORE "Not just Honda, but other Japanese companies are obviously experiencing a lot of problems as a result of the earthquake. Is that destroying value? Yes a little bit, (but) when you put that in the context of the total value of the company, then it isn't that significant because the total value of the company is the total value of all future profits. "The question really is how is the long-term case for the company impacted? We don't really see any impact. We are probably more overweight on Honda than Toyota. We don't see any reason to change our views on Honda." KO SEUNG-JAE, FUND MANAGER, DREAM ASSET "I am very positive on Hyundai's future performance, and its strong earnings and market share gains will continue in the next quarter. "Even though the company faces such risks as limited production capacity and labor-management strife, these can be settled with its efforts." KYUNG WOO-HYUN, FUND MANAGER, DAISHIN ASSET MANAGEMENT "The figures today were surprisingly strong, and we expect current robust earnings momentum to continue through this year. Hyundai Motor will easily achieve net profit of 6.5 trillion won in 2011. "Production disruptions in Japan are helping, and positive effects will be more visible in the second and third quarter. "It's not just the Japan factor, but other positive factors like a good product mix and quality that are helping Hyundai Motor expand its market share." LEE DONG-JIN, FUND MANAGER, KTB ASSET MANAGEMENT "I look at Hyundai very positively. It's now seen as a global automotive group, not just a Korean carmaker. "Hyundai has been emerging as an alternative to Japanese cars, shaking off its image as a maker of cheap cars. It's now seeing some benefits from increasing production at overseas plants while the world took a hit from the financial crisis. "Hyundai shares have overshot in recent days but I think the upward trend will continue." KANG SUN-SIK, CHIEF ANALYST, WOORI ASSET MANAGEMENT "The first quarter earnings are very good and the outlook is even rosier. "One risk factor is exchange rate trends, since export markets account for a large part of Hyundai Motor's earnings. "We think the company will perform well in gaining market share in the long term since it has good fundamentals."
