 MADRID/MILAN  (Reuters) - Italian utility Enel ( ENEI.MI ) and Spanish builder Acciona ( ANA.MC ) are discussing a possible joint bid for Spanish power giant Endesa expected to top a 41 billion euro ($55 billion) offer from Germany's E.ON. 

 Enel and Acciona said on Friday the scheme would proceed only if the offer from E.ON EONG.DE for Spain's largest utility Endesa ( ELE.MC ) failed to obtain 50 percent of Endesa's capital when the offer closes on Thursday. Enel said the talks between the two shareholders, which together own 46 percent of Endesa, were at an advanced stage. But they said there was no agreement yet, and did not put a price on any possible counter-offer. E.ON., the world's largest utility, said meantime it was sticking to its current offer. Analysts said any offer from Enel and Acciona was likely to be pitched between 40 to 42 euros per share, comfortably beating E.ON's offer of 38.75 euros per share and valuing the Spanish power firm at up to 44.3 billion euros. Some analysts said the prospect of a higher bid suggested shareholders could sit back and hold out for a more tempting offer, meaning E.ON's bid would lapse on Thursday. "Shareholders will now most likely not accept the E.ON bid at 38.75 euros per share ... and instead wait for an improved bid at the new higher price," said ING in a research note. However, fund managers pointed out there was no guarantee Acciona and Enel would make a higher offer, and any possible bid should be priced nearer to 42 euros per share to tempt shareholders this late in the game. "I'm not sure that 40 euros per share is a significant enough premium for people to suddenly switch horses at this stage," said Rupert Morrell, senior fund manager at Premier Asset Management, and a holder of Enel shares. E.ON traded over 2 percent lower on the announcements from Enel and Acciona. Enel's Chairman Piero Gnudi said any arrangement with Acciona would be what he called a deal between equals. It would likely involve a chairman nominated by Acciona and a CEO nominated by Enel, a source familiar with the matter said. CONCRETE OFFER Enel's move on Endesa is the former monopoly's first big move into Western Europe since it gave up on bidding for France's Suez LYOE.PA last year. CEO Fulvio Conti has said there would be room for only a few integrated global players in Europe in coming years, and Enel wanted to be among them. Fund managers and analysts said Acciona and Enel should float an offer before the E.ON bid closed next Thursday for shareholders to take the risk of waiting for a new bid. The jury was still out as to whether a fo0rmal offer would be sanctioned. Spanish takeover rules do not allow for any further bids for Endesa while E.ON's is still under way. Officials at Spanish stock market regulator CNMV were not immediately available to comment on the matter. Credit Suisse questioned what steps E.ON would have to take if it were to follow up with a counter-bid to thwart any joint Enel/Acciona move. "One of the question marks is whether E.ON would need to go through a new regulatory process if its current bid lapses unsuccessful and it decides to counter-bid Enel," said Credit Suisse analyst Raimundo Fernandez-Cuesta. E.ON's offer has been hampered by opposition from the Spanish government, which would have preferred to create a national energy champion, and by the purchases of major stakes in Endesa by Acciona and Enel. One disgruntled E.ON shareholder, who asked to remain annoymous, said the move raised suspicions of political foul play between Italy and Spain. Enel's unexpected arrival on the scene at the end of February, when it bought a stake in the Spanish power firm, drew accusations of political collusion, coming just a week after a meeting between the prime ministers of Italy and Spain. "It's not good for the free market and it's not good for Spain," said the UK-based fund manager of the possibility of a joint Spanish-Italian bid. A successful Enel-Acciona bid for Endesa would create a company with 92,500 megawatts of generating capacity, and around 53 million customers for its electricity. Shares in Enel were virtually unchanged at 7.94 euros at 1051 GMT. E.ON shares were 2.4 percent lower at 98.95 euros. Endesa's shares were suspended by the market regulator pending clarification of the intentions of Enel and Acciona.
