 PHILADELPHIA  (Reuters) - Rising defaults on subprime mortgages for riskier borrowers in the United States could affect other areas of the U.S. economy, the head of the International Monetary Fund warned on Friday. 

 IMF Managing Director Rodrigo Rato said in a speech at the University of Pennsylvania the problems in subprime mortgage markets were one of three risky developments in financial markets, which could eventually affect the global economy. However, he repeated that world economic fundamentals were currently strong, with growth set to continue its strongest five-year run since the late 1960s at close to 5 percent. Among other risks, the IMF chief pointed to large increases in private equity buy-outs financed by a bigger proportion of debt. If these deals turn tour, it could trigger a reappraisal of risk, which could ultimately lead to a tightening of credit for other corporate borrowers, he cautioned. "This could adversely affect investment and growth prospects," Rato added. In addition, he said there were risks from large capital flows into emerging markets, especially bank-based flows into Eastern Europe and sub-Saharan Africa. While the capital flows into these markets are welcome, they exposed the countries to dangers if investors bailed from riskier assets. Rato's comments on the subprime market -- which involves loans to borrowers with weak credit -- came a day after U.S. federal regulators took a lashing in Congress and acknowledged they should have done more to stop the spread of fallout in the multi-trillion market. The implosion of the subprime market means that some half a million Americans are likely to be unable to obtain mortgage financing over the next two years, according to the National Association of Realtors. Financial markets have been concerned that the credit tightening apparent in the subprime market will broaden out and hurt the economy at large. But U.S. policy-makers have said the stress in the subprime mortgage market is contained. "As of now, though, there are few signs that the disruptions in this one sector of credit markets will have a lasting impact on credit markets as a whole," New York Federal Reserve Bank President Timothy Geithner told a credit market symposium in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Friday Rato said the subprime mortgage problems suggested that lenders' underwriting standards needed to be reviewed. He also pointed to the increase in the number of hedge funds -- fourteen times more than in 1990 -- which required closer attention by regulators and the need to educate borrowers on risks. "As the structure of markets changes, supervisors may need to adapt the framework of supervision to improve investor protection and reduce systemic risks and vulnerabilities," he said. Overall, financial risks have shifted from banking and financial sectors to a range of areas including to households and hedge funds. "Individuals are increasingly taking on financial risks much more directly," he said. Separate warnings came from Jaime Caruana, director of the IMF's monetary and capital markets division, who said financial stability could be challenged by a decline in credit quality and noted this was already evident in the subprime mortgage market -- and may be spreading. Speaking at the symposium in Charlotte, Caruana said credit derivatives, which allow investors to buy insurance against default, had blossomed but they had not been tested in real crises. "We think these new instruments reman untested for a sustained downtown or a severe shock," he told a panel.
