 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A big shareholder of No. 3 Japanese brokerage Nikko Cordial Corp. said on Friday that Nikko is worth a lot more than Citigroup is currently offering. 

 Southeastern Asset Management, which controls about 6.6 percent of Nikko Cordial Corp.8603.T, said it has increased its appraisal above its initial assessment of 2,000 yen per share. Last week, Citigroup ( C.N ) began accepting tenders for its roughly $14 billion takeover bid for Nikko at 1,700 yen per share and said it would not increase its bid a second time. Citigroup's original offer valued Nikko at 1,350 yen per share. Southeastern is now expected to hold on to its Nikko stake. Citigroup, the largest U.S. bank, already holds roughly 5 percent of Nikko and is offering to buy all shares tendered as it aims for a minimum of 50 percent. "Based on our review of the summary Citigroup/Nikko Cordial alliance agreement, we have increased our appraisal of Nikko Cordial above our initial assessment of 2,000 yen per share," said O. Mason Hawkins, chief executive of Southeastern, in a statement. "We welcome Citigroup's involvement in Nikko Cordial's management and look forward to working with them." Citigroup declined to comment. Southeastern said it welcomed provisions in the Citigroup/Nikko alliance agreement for the protection of minority shareholders through the appointment of independent shareholders. "Our support of the alliance remains contingent on the identity and demonstrated independence of these directors," added Hawkins. "In co-operation with Citigroup, we believe Nikko Cordial can grow its intrinsic value rapidly in the years to come." SUPPORT Another big Nikko shareholder, Harris Associates LP, which controls about 6 percent of the brokerage, has also told news media that Nikko shares are worth more than 2,000 yen each. But one major Nikko shareholder, Mizuho Financial Group Inc. ( 8411.T ) will tender all of its shares in Nikko to Citigroup, a source close to the matter said on March 16, boosting the chances the takeover bid will succeed. Mizuho Corporate Bank, Mizuho Financial Group's corporate lending arm, holds a 4.8 percent stake in Nikko, which agreed to be taken over by Citigroup after an accounting scandal led to a downturn in business and an executive shake-up. Citigroup raised its bid price after Nikko escaped delisting by the Tokyo Stock Exchange over the accounting scandal, a development that weakened the bank's leverage against North American investors who had dismissed its offer as too low. Management at Nikko has agreed to the Citigroup deal, which would be the biggest-ever foreign buyout of a Japanese company. ($1=117.72 yen)
