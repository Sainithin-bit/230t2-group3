 ALEXANDRIA, Va  (Reuters) - A federal judge said on Friday he will wait two weeks before formally signing a permanent injunction barring Vonage Holdings Corp. from using key Internet phone call technology owned by rival Verizon Communications Inc. 

 Earlier, U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton said he would grant Verizon's request for an injunction prohibiting Vonage from using some voice-over-Internet Protocol (VoIP) technologies that allow consumers to make calls over the Internet. The judge said that over the coming two weeks he will consider Vonage's request to stay the injunction while Vonage appeals the case.
