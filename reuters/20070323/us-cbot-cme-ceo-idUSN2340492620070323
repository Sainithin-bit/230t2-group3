 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings Inc.'s CME.N chief executive said on Friday he sees no need to respond to a rival bid for CBOT Holdings BOT.N by IntercontinentalExchange Inc. ( ICE.N ). 

 "There's no need for us to respond to what is obviously demonstrably inferior," Craig Donohue said in an interview with CNBC television in response to a question about whether CME would raise its bid in response. Donohue also said he expects the proposed CME-CBOT deal to win approval from regulators at the U.S. Department of Justice without any problems.
