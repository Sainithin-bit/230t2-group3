 PHILADELPHIA  (Reuters) - Staffing services firm Kronos Inc. KRON.O said on Friday that it agreed to be acquired by private equity firm Hellman and Friedman LLC for about $1.8 billion. 

 Hellman and Friedman would pay $55 a share in cash, marking almost an 18-percent premium over Kronos' closing price of $46.63 on Thursday. The shares rose $6.27 or 13.5 percent to $52.90 in midday trading on Nasdaq. JMI Equity, a private equity firm focused on the software and business services industries, would participate in the deal alongside lead investor Hellman and Friedman. Additional details were not immediately available. Asset sales and spin-offs are not part of the deal and no significant restructuring is anticipated, Kronos Chief Executive Aron Ain said in a letter to employees. No work force reductions are expected, Ain said in the letter, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. "Hellman & Friedman shares our commitment to accelerate our global and talent management expansion initiatives," Ain said in a statement. "Kronos remains deeply committed to the markets we serve, and we now expect to have even greater flexibility to invest in our customers, technology, and people," Ain said. The deal is expected to close during the fourth quarter, Kronos said. The transaction would be financed through a combination of debt and equity financing and cash and other short-term investments of Kronos. A unit of Jefferies and Co. served as the financial adviser to a special committee of the Kronos board. (Additional reporting by  Jessica Hall  in Philadelphia)
