 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - For the first time since 2003, General 
Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) is giving bonuses in the form of stock to 
Chairman and Chief Executive Rick Wagoner and other top 
executives. 

  Wagoner received restricted stock valued at $2.8 million 
and 500,000 options, according to a filing with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission.  The company will disclose full compensation details in its 
annual proxy, which will be released in April.  The world biggest automaker reported last week that it 
swung to a profit in the fourth quarter but fell short of Wall 
Street expectations on mounting mortgage losses from its former 
finance unit.  Analysts say that among struggling Detroit automakers, GM 
has made the most progress toward a financial turnaround.  The company's net loss narrowed to $2 billion in 2006 from 
$10.4 billion in 2005. Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) lost $12.7 billion 
last year, while DaimlerChrysler AG's DCXGn.DE Chrysler unit 
lost almost $1.5 billion.  GM said it remains on track to cut structural costs by $9 
billion this year compared with 2005, before it began a 
sweeping restructuring.  The automaker, which is expected to be challenged for the 
top spot in global sales by Toyota Motor Corp. ( 7203.T ) in 
2007, is banking on the success of many new products this year, 
including new sport utility vehicles, which were hurt last year 
as high gas prices drove consumers to more fuel-efficient 
vehicles.
