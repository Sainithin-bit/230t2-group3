 MUMBAI  (Reuters) - Citigroup ( C.N ) has bought nearly a fifth of Anand Rathi Securities, an official at the Indian brokerage said on Friday, in another foreign foray into the country's growing financial services business. 

 "We have sold 19.9 percent stake to Citigroup Venture Capital," the official, who did not want to be identified, told Reuters. The official did not disclose the value of the deal but said a statement would be issued later on Friday. Earlier this month, BNP Paribas ( BNPP.PA ), the euro zone's second-biggest bank by value, said it was extending its alliance with India's Geojit Financial Services Ltd. ( GEOJ.BO ) to institutional brokerage and expand its investment banking business. Anand Rathi Securities was set up in 1994 by Anand Rathi, a former president of the Bombay Stock Exchange. It has offices in Dubai, Bangkok and several Indian cities. The company provides a variety of services such as wealth management, investment banking, brokerage and distribution of equities, commodities, mutual funds and insurance.
