 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - TD Banknorth Inc. BNK.N, the U.S. retail banking unit of Canada's Toronto-Dominion Bank ( TD.TO ), said on Friday it plans to cut 400 jobs and close as many as 24 branches to help lower operating expenses. 

 The job cuts cover 5 percent of TD Banknorth's work force. The bank, which is based in Portland, Maine, plans to shut 13 branches in New Jersey, four in Connecticut, three in New York, and two each in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. TD Banknorth expects to eliminate the jobs in the next several months, and shut most of the branches in the third quarter. It ended 2006 with about 8,700 employees, and operates more than 600 branches in eight northeast U.S. states. Jeff Nathanson, a TD Banknorth spokesman, said the bank will take a restructuring charge. He also said "the vast majority" of branch closures in New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania will be former Hudson United Bancorp branches. TD Banknorth paid $1.9 billion for Mahwah, New Jersey-based Hudson United in January 2006. A year later it bought Saddle Brook, New Jersey's Interchange Financial Services Corp. for $481 million. Chief Executive Bharat Masrani said the cuts are "necessary in response to the current operating environment," and will help lower operating costs by 5 percent to 8 percent by 2008. Noninterest expenses totaled $1.14 billion last year. Masrani worked at Toronto-Dominion for 20 years before replacing William Ryan at the helm of TD Banknorth this month. TD Banknorth has struggled in recent quarters from slowing loan growth, stiff competition for loans and deposits, and narrowed lending margins. An inverted yield curve, where short-term interest rates are higher than long-term rates, has made it harder to charge enough on loans to make up for rising borrowing costs. In November, Toronto-Dominion's parent, TD Bank Financial Group, agreed to pay $3.2 billion for the 43 percent of TD Banknorth it did not already own. TD Banknorth shareholders are scheduled to vote on the purchase on April 18. Nathanson said the transaction should close by the end of April, pending approval from Massachusetts regulators. TD Banknorth shares rose 1 cent to $32.11 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
