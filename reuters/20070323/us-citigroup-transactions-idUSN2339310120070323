 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc. ( C.N ), the largest U.S. bank, on Friday said it named Paul Galant head of global transaction services, and that it will streamline operations that provide corporate banking products and services. 

 Galant previously led a global cash management business at Citigroup. In his new job, he replaces Ellen Alemany, who left to become chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland Plc's ( RBS.L ) RBS America unit. The transaction services group last year increased profit 26 percent to $1.43 billion, while revenue increased 22 percent to $5.97 billion. Separately, Citigroup plans to consolidate all client platforms that provide corporate banking products and services into two groups: the global corporate bank, led by Mike Corbat, and the global commercial bank, led by Suneel Bakhshi. The corporate bank will work with large clients, while the commercial bank will work with small and mid-sized clients, Citigroup said. Michael Klein, the co-chief of corporate and investment banking, announced the changes in separate memos. A Citigroup spokesman confirmed the content of the memos. Chief Executive Charles Prince is trying to cut costs at Citigroup, which last year rose twice as fast as revenue. Chief Operating Officer Robert Druskin is nearing the end of a companywide review of costs.
