 TOKYO  (Reuters) - General Electric Co. ( GE.N ) said on Friday it would launch a $1.14 billion takeover bid for leasing firm Sanyo Electric Credit Co. 8565.T to further expand into Japan's $68 billion leasing market. 

 The deal will also lead to a windfall gain for top shareholder Goldman Sachs Group Inc. ( GS.N ), which bought a large stake in Sanyo Credit a little over a year ago from struggling electronics maker Sanyo Electric Co. 6764.T. GE is a formidable player in Japan's leasing market, serving large and medium-sized companies. The acquisition would likely help it expand its customer base because Sanyo Electric Credit focuses on smaller firms. "This should be a good fit for GE. There is no real customer overlap," said Shiro Yoshioka, an analyst who covers the leasing industry at Mizuho Securities. The expansion of its leasing business comes about two weeks after GE announced plans to close 60 percent of its manned consumer finance branches in Japan and shed up to 400 employees amid an industrywide slump prompted by tighter regulation. GE will pay 3,250 yen per Sanyo Electric Credit share, a premium of nearly 62 percent from Friday's closing price of 2,010 yen and valuing the company at 16 times earnings, roughly in line with rival leasing giant Orix Corp. ( 8591.T ) The U.S. financial and manufacturing giant said it would aim to be at least two-thirds of the company for an estimated 90.14 billion yen ($764 million) but would buy all shares tendered, which could boost the deal to 135 billion yen ($1.14 billion). Sanyo Credit said it had agreed to the offer, which will run from Monday until May 9. It said that Goldman has also agreed to sell its shares. GOLDMAN GAIN Goldman Sachs spent about 33 billion yen over a year ago to take a 42 percent stake in Sanyo Electric Credit, but it has since sold down its holding to 33.2 percent. Goldman will be able to sell its stake for about 43 billion yen, likely netting it a profit of about 17 billion yen, based on its original acquisition price of around 2,000 yen a share. The U.S. investment bank is also sitting on a large potential gain from the 125 billion yen in preferred shares it bought from Sanyo Electric in a bailout of the consumer electronics maker last year. The shares are convertible at 70 yen, compared to the stock's current market price of 181 yen. A spokesman for Sanyo Electric, expected to post its third straight annual loss in the year ending this month, said the company had not yet decided whether to sell its 16.7 percent stake in Sanyo Credit. Sanyo Credit gets about 60 percent of its sales from leasing computers and other equipment mainly to businesses. It generates about 30 percent from lending to businesses and the remaining 10 percent from consumer credit operations. It posted an operating profit of 11.5 billion yen on revenues of 33.4 billion yen in the past business year ended March 2006. GE's commercial finance unit, which includes its leasing operations, has annual sales of just over 1 trillion yen. Mitsubishi UFJ Securities will manage the tender offer.
