 CHARLOTTE, North Carolina  (Reuters) - Turbulence in the U.S. market for high-risk mortgages is not likely to have a long-lasting effect on broader credit markets, New York Federal Reserve President Timothy Geithner said on Friday. 

 "The latest wave of credit market innovations has elicited some concerns about their implications for the stability of the financial system," Geithner told a credit market symposium hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. "These concerns have been heightened in some quarters by problems currently being experienced in the subprime mortgage sector. As of now, though, there are few signs that the disruptions in this one sector of the credit markets will have a lasting impact on credit markets as a whole." Geithner reiterated his support for complex credit instruments such as derivatives as a mitigator of risk, but warned that financial institutions and regulators should constantly try to improve mechanisms for the assessment of risk. "The most productive focus of policy attention has to be on improving the shock absorbers in the core financial system, in terms of capital and liquidity relative to the risk and the robustness of the infrastructure," he said. With this in mind, Geithner said that the Fed was working to reinforce the ability of firms to absorb shocks, be more conservative in action and modernize back-office operations. "The stronger these shock absorbers, the more resilient markets will be in the face of future shocks," he said.
