 (Reuters) - Bankrupt bookseller Borders Group Inc BGPIQ.PK said it has received indications of third-party interest for its business that could keep it running as a going concern, a source close to the matter told Reuters. 

 The source declined to provide further details. Borders Group Inc, after years of shriveling sales and carrying a heavy debt load, filed for bankruptcy in February and has been soliciting offers for a sale of the company ever since. The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter, on Friday said a possible bidder expressed interest in more than 225 of the bookseller's remaining superstores. No bidder has expressed interest in purchasing all of its outlets, which total about 400, the paper said. Bloomberg reported that larger rival Barnes & Noble Inc ( BKS.N ) offered to buy about 10 stores, while other parties have also bid for parts of the business.
