 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The World Bank on Sunday agreed to give emerging economies greater influence in the institution, a shift that puts China third in voting power behind the United States and Japan. 

 The agreement will increase the votes of developing countries by 3.13 percent, contributing $1.6 billion to World Bank resources. In addition, members agreed to a capital increase of $3.5 billion for the bank -- the first in more than 20 years. (Reporting by  Lesley Wroughton ; editing by  Patrick Graham )
