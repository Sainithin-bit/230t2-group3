 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Foreign investment into Jordan should rise to $2 billion dinars ($2.82 billion) in 2010, aiding a steady economic recovery, but the central bank is in no danger of raising interest rates, the bank's governor said on Saturday. 

 Umayya Toukan told Reuters on the sidelines of the IMF's spring meetings that the economy was recovering but would take some time to get back to previous growth levels -- which have slumped since it expanded 7.8 percent in 2008. Asked if there could be an interest rate increase in the near future he said: "No, I don't think so." The Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) in December cut its discount rate to 4.75 percent and repo rate to 4.5 pct. Overnight rates on the dinar, which banks receive on excess liquidity, were cut to 2.50 percent. Its economy grew 2.8 percent last year and the IMF has forecast growth of 4 percent for this year, but Toukan signaled risks to inflation -- now at 4.6 percent -- were limited. "There is more of a risk to the downside than that of the risk of inflation, but we have to be vigilant," he said. "Inflation in most emerging markets is acquiring momentum given the high growth rates in some countries like China and India." While Jordan's economy has weathered the global economic downturn better than most Western economies, domestic demand, exports, tourism and remittances from abroad have all been hit and its budget deficit is set to hit record levels. The central bank took a series of preemptive measures to soften monetary policy from the global turbulence at the end of 2008 also cutting reserve requirements on commercial deposits, and stopping issuing certificates of deposit. Tourism, one of the Kingdom's main industries, posted over 30 percent growth in the first quarter this year, while exports went up by 4 or 5 percent and construction did have a positive rate of growth, Toukan said. The aid-dependent kingdom has close business and economic ties to Gulf Arab governments which were hard hit by a drop in oil prices last year, their main source of state revenue. Its budget deficit doubled to $2 billion last year. Apart from the tourism sector, technology, manufacturing, banking, and water and energy industries have large potential for growth. Currently the Kingdom imports 98 percent of its energy needs but is looking for development projects in clean energy, Toukan said. The government cut corporate taxes for banks to 30 percent from 38 percent and cut tax for industry by 4 percentage points to 14 percent. It also offered long-term tax breaks for foreign direct investment in industrial and free zones. (Additional reporting by Dan Burns)
