 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund said on Sunday it had accelerated discussions with Greece and will conclude talks on an aid package in time to meet Greece's funding needs. 

 Here is the text of the IMF statement: Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), made the following statement today after his meeting with Greek Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou: "The Minister and I had a very constructive meeting and I am impressed with the Greek authorities' determination to take the actions necessary to put their economy back on track. "Since we received the request for financial support last Friday, our discussions with the authorities have accelerated. The IMF, the European partners, and everyone involved in the financing effort recognizes the need for speed. I am confident that we will conclude discussions in time to meet Greece's needs. "We are all aware of the seriousness of the situation and the courageous efforts being made by the Greek people." (Reporting by  Lesley Wroughton ; editing by  William Schomberg )
