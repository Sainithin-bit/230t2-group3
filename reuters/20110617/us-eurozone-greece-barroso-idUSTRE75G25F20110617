 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso called on Friday for Greek politicians to support reforms, saying the country itself and the European Union must both work to preserve financial stability. 

 "I call on all political forces to put all their energy in securing broad political support of economic reform that Greece needs. It is a reform for the benefit of the people and for the benefit of Greece," Barroso told reporters in Brussels. "Greece must do its part and the European Union must do its part to preserve financial stability and economy recovery in Greece and in Europe," he said, adding that it was critical that Greece wanted support to help it through its difficulties, and that it can deliver on its part too. Barroso said he expects Sunday's Eurogroup to resolve remaining differences and come to a "responsible agreement" on financial assistance to Greece.
