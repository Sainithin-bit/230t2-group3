 (Reuters) - A series of violent and often inexplicable short-term price moves in commodities over the last two years has shone a spotlight on the growing role of high-frequency trading (HFT) in commodity markets. 

 Here is a list of some of the more extreme moves since the start of 2010. MARKET: Natural gas DATE: June 9, 2011 PRICE ACTION: Prices fell by 8 percent in just 15 seconds before bouncing back in a matter of minutes. Prices fell from $4.916 per million British thermal units to $4.513 between 25 and 40 seconds past 2342 GMT. By 2350 GMT prices had recovered to $4.802, and by 0800 GMT, natgas stood at $4.827. The drop was preceded by trades in an ever-widening band. REPORTED CAUSE: Dualing HFT algorithms in thin Asian trade MARKET: Oil - Brent and U.S. crude futures DATE: May 5, 2011 PRICE ACTION: Prices fell by as much as $13 a barrel at one stage and posted a near-record percentage loss for the day. Wave after wave of relentless selling drove prices lower, the likes of which has only previously been seen following a major event such as the collapse of Lehman Brothers. REPORTED CAUSE: Heavy fund selling, algorithmic traders hunting out sell-stops, fears a bubble had formed in oil
