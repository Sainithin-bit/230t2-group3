 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Greece will be saved from its severe debt crisis without deviating from its fiscal targets, new Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said on Friday. 

 "The country must be saved and will be saved," Venizelos told reporters after he was appointed to replace outgoing Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou in a reshuffle. He added that he had harbored doubts about taking the post. "I did it with much thought and not without doubts. I did it because I consider it my patriotic duty," he said.
