 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Traditionally fat expense accounts on Wall Street are about to get slashed as major banks set out to cut spending and staffing due to weaker markets and new regulation that will cut in to their profits. 

 Goldman Sachs Group Inc plans to cut as much as $1 billion in non-compensation expenses -- costs not directly linked to salaries, bonuses and benefits -- over the next 12 months, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday. "We will turn over every rock," the source said. The bank, which currently employs some 35,400 staff around the world, will also review staffing levels, and job cuts are "certain" to come over the next months, the source added, though the bank has not set a specific target. Goldman Sachs declined to comment. Trading desks across Wall Street are feeling the heat as new regulation forces banks to shut down some business lines, such as trading for their own account, or to reduce staffing in other areas -- such as derivatives trading -- which are set to become more streamlined and automated. Bankers say it is still too early to tell what the precise impact of the new regulations will be, with many of the final rules still far from completion. But they acknowledge that no matter how the regulatory debate plays out, profitability across the sector will fall and that the days of double-digit return on equity -- a key measure of banks' profitability -- are likely over.
