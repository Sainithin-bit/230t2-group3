 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou will appoint current Defense Minister Evangelos Venizelos as new finance minister in a reshuffle on Friday, a government official told Reuters. 

 Papandreou will name a new cabinet later on Friday to muster support for painful economic reforms, in the face of public unrest and a split in his party that could push the country closer to debt default. "Venizelos will be the next finance minister," the official said. Venizelos replaces George Papaconstantinou, who had been widely expected to be sacrificed by Papandreou because he was the architect of the deeply unpopular austerity reforms made to meet the terms of a European Union-International Monetary Fund bailout. Papaconstantinou will become environment minister in the reshuffle, state television NET reported. Venizelos, once Papandreou's biggest rival, challenged him for the leadership of the Socialist PASOK party after its second consecutive election defeat in 2007. He has held several cabinet posts in previous socialist administrations since the mid-1990s, including government spokesman, justice minister and development minister. Married with one daughter, Venizelos entered politics in 1993 as a deputy for his native district of Thessaloniki. (Reporting by Renee Maltezou; Writing by  Ingrid Melander ; editing by  Barry Moody )
