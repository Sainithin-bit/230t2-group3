 BERLIN  (Reuters) - French President Nicolas Sarkozy said on Friday that "there was no time to lose" on agreeing a program for Greece, suggesting that a deal needed to be reached in July at the latest. 

 "We want to go as quickly as possible without fixing a date," Sarkozy said after a meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, adding that the pair had the same position on Greece. "Since September is not as quickly as possible and we may have other concerns in August and we are in the second half of June, you see what I mean," he told a news conference in Berlin. Sarkozy said a second bailout program for Greece would need the backing of the ECB. Any private sector involvement would need to be voluntary and avoid triggering a credit event, he said, while Merkel said voluntary participation of the private sector on the basis of the "Vienna Initiative" was a good foundation for a new deal.
