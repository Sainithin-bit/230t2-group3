 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The review of Italy's sovereign credit ratings was triggered by fresh concerns about higher interest rates in the euro zone, coupled with existing weaknesses in the Italian economy, Moody's said on Friday. 

 The ratings agency warned it may cut Italy's "Aa2" credit rating also due to challenges to economic growth and risks to implementation of a fiscal consolidation plan. "Italy has had structural impediments to growth for some time. However, today, these challenges coexist with a scenario of rising interest rates and fragile market sentiment," Moody's analyst Alexander Kockerbeck told Reuters in an interview. He said Moody's intends to conclude the review of Italy's ratings in 90 days. He refused to comment on the magnitude of a possible downgrade of Greece's credit ratings.
