 LONDON  (Reuters) - BHP Billiton wrote to Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc on August 13 saying a deal at $130 a share offered "value certainty" to Potash shareholders and BHP's "strong preference" was for a friendly deal. 

 The letter, reproduced as a PDF file on the Financial Times website, was signed by Chairman Jac Nasser and said BHP had "fully negotiated a financing facilities agreement with our relationship banks" to fund a deal. A BHP spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment to verify the letter's authenticity. (Reporting by  Quentin Webb  and  Victoria Howley ; editing by  Douwe Miedema )
