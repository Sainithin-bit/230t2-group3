 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner on Tuesday said there is a strong case for a carefully designed government guarantee for mortgages as policy makers embark on restructuring Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 

 "Without such support, the risk is that future recessions could be more severe because the financial system would not have the capital to support mortgage lending on an adequate scale," Geithner said in remarks prepared for delivery to a housing finance conference. "House price declines could be more acute, with even greater damage to financial wealth." (Reporting by  David Lawder ; Editing by Theodore d'Afflisio)
