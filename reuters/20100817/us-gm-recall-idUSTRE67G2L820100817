 DETROIT/WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - General Motors Co will recall more than 243,000 model year 2009/2010 crossover sport utilities, mainly in the United States, to inspect safety belts for possible damage, the automaker said on Tuesday. 

 The automaker and regulators said most of the Chevy Traverse, Buick Enclave, GMC Acadia, and Saturn Outlook vehicles were shipped within the United States. Several thousands others were exported to Canada, Mexico, China, Saudi Arabia and other countries. GM said potential damage to the second-row safety belts could make it appear as if the latch were properly secured when it was not. The problem was discovered during warranty returns, and any damage was cosmetic in the vast majority of cases, GM said in documents filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). There are no known cases of belts failing in a crash, GM said. GM said it would begin notifying owners by letter this month to make appointments with dealership service departments for repairs.
