 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - European Union finance ministers have prepared the foundations for an agreement on European bank recapitalization to be struck at a summit of EU leaders on Sunday, Sweden's Finance Minister Anders Borg said on Saturday. 
 "We have laid down the foundations for an agreement on the banks," Borg told reporters after a meeting of EU finance ministers. "The first solution (for bank recapitalization) is withholding dividends and tapping profits and obviously there will be a responsibility for national governments," he said.
