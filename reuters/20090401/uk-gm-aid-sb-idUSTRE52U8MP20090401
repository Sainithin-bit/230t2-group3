 LONDON  (Reuters) - General Motors has approached the British government to discuss a 600 million pound aid package for its local marque Vauxhall, the Financial Times quoted a leading trade union official as saying. 

 According to the FT's Wednesday edition, the car maker confirmed it had spoken to the government but denied it had made a specific request. "We have talked to government, but haven't gotten to the stage of discussing numbers," GM spokesman Denis Chick was cited as saying. GM was not immediately available for comment. Tony Woodley, joint general secretary of trade union Unite, said that the managing director of Vauxhall had raised the request with the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, the FT said. The news follows a call on Monday by U.S. President Barack Obama for GM and Chrysler to accelerate their survival efforts and brace for possible bankruptcy. Obama added that neither company had done enough to justify the taxpayer money they were seeking but gave GM and Chrysler a little more time and money to wring further concessions from workers, creditors and other stakeholders. In February GM Europe submitted a rescue plan for German car maker Opel, owned by U.S.-based GM, under which Opel and Vauxhall would be partly spun off into a new subsidiary. It said the independent unit would need 3.3 billion euros (3 billion pounds) in state aid. (Reporting by  Olesya Dmitracova ; Editing by Phil Berlowitz)
