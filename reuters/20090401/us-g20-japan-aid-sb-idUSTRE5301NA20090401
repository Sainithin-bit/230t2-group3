 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Germany does not understand the importance of fiscal stimulus as a response to the financial crisis, Japan's Prime Minister Taro Aso was quoted as saying on Wednesday as leaders headed for a summit of G20 powers. 

 Ahead of the summit, Japan has sided with the United States' push for governments to pump more money into economies, while France and Germany have said they do not want this to distract from the need to regulate and rein in financial market excess. Aso said on Tuesday he planned to submit an extra budget to fund a new stimulus package, although he gave no details on how much the government would spend to shore up an economy in recession. "I think there are countries who understand the importance of fiscal mobilization and there are some countries that do not," he told the Financial Times in an interview splashed across the paper's front page on Wednesday. "Which is why, I believe, Germany has come up with their views." He also said Japan would provide 500 billion yen ($5.1 billion) in aid over the next three years to Asian countries suffering from the global economic slump. Aso, speaking in Davos in January, offered $17 billion in overseas development assistance to Asian countries to fight the crisis.
