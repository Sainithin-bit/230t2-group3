 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - News Corp has named former AOL Chief Executive Jonathan Miller to supervise the media conglomerate's digital strategy, Rupert Murdoch's media conglomerate said on Wednesday. 

 News Corp also said that 20-year company veteran Peter Levinsohn will be the president of new media and digital distribution at Fox Filmed Entertainment, which controls News Corp's film and television content. The changes are the latest in a series of executive and department moves that Murdoch has made as his No. 2 executive, Peter Chernin, prepares to leave the company later this year. Miller would direct News Corp's digital businesses, including the MySpace social network, IGN Entertainment, the Photobucket pictures website and its Hulu online TV joint venture with General Electric Co's NBC-Universal. Miller's role also would give one executive command of News Corp's digital operations, a move that could help the sprawling media company find more ways to beef up advertising sales that have slumped because of the world financial crisis. Murdoch in a press release said the company wants to "enable our digital businesses to flourish as individual entities and to bolster the digital strategies of our core media properties by treating them as central to, and not separate from, the enterprise." While Miller will run News Corp's online strategy, Levinsohn will supervise Fox Filmed Entertainment's content on Hulu, as well as in the mobile phone and gaming markets. Levinsohn most recently ran Fox Interactive Media, which includes MySpace. Miller is a founding partner of Velocity Interactive Group, an investment firm that includes Ross Levinsohn, a former News Corp executive and Peter Levinsohn's cousin. He also was chief executive of Time Warner Inc's AOL, a position he left in 2006. (Reporting by  Robert MacMillan ; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)
