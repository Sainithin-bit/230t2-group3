 DETROIT  (Reuters) - The U.S. autos task force overseeing the restructuring of General Motors Corp on Wednesday asked a federal bankruptcy judge to block the automaker from providing an additional $150 million in funding to bankrupt parts supplier Delphi Corp 

 The task force asked U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain, of the Southern District of New York to give the federal government until April 30 to assess the GM's relationship with its troubled former parts subsidiary. Earlier this week the task force, which is headed by former investment banker Steve Rattner, gave GM 60 days until June 1 to come up with a more sweeping plan to cut costs and slash debt under the threat of bankruptcy.
