 BERLIN  (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Wednesday she supported French President Nicolas Sarkozy's position that the G20 should not settle for weak compromises at its summit in London this week. 

 "What the French President means is that we must ... not make weak compromises with a view to the financial market constitution of the future. I support him in this," Merkel told reporters in Berlin before leaving for the G20 meeting. Sarkozy said earlier on Wednesday that current proposals for an accord at the G20 summit did not satisfy France and Germany, and that he would not be associated with "false compromises."
