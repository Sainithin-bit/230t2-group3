 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - An expected revision of two key accounting rules governing toxic banking assets may add a whole new layer of complexity to the U.S. government's attempts to cleanse the balance sheets of the nation's banks. 

 On Thursday, following intense pressure from Congress, the Financial Accounting Standards Board is likely to water down some mark-to-market rules often blamed for exacerbating the financial crisis by forcing banks to value troubled assets at distressed levels and take resulting hits to their earnings. On the one hand, some market participants think softer rules will be a disincentive for banks to bite the bullet and sell their toxic assets to investors. "Banks and insurance companies have every incentive to hold their securities and wait for accounting relief," Amherst Securities Group analysts said in a research note. But banks and securities industry lobbyists say that the changes to one rule, FAS 157, do not go far enough and could increase the risk that a fire-sale price set by federal programs will unintentionally translate into a big hit to other assets on their balance sheets. Banks argue that they should have more leeway to ignore fire-sale prices, particularly when they are not for identical assets. Some experts likened the accounting issues to similar problems in the U.S. housing market where foreclosure sales are often at prices below most perceptions of the values of similar properties in a neighborhood. "It's asking if someone is willing to buy something on the courthouse steps, and that's not right," said Mike Heflin of FTN Financial's structured finance group in Memphis, Tennessee. The Commercial Mortgage Securities Association (CMSA) says the factors still proposed by FASB to determine if a transaction is distressed are flawed, increasing the chance that assets could be valued based on transactions at artificially low prices. The CMSA wants to use a more flexible, judgment-based analysis to determine if a particular transaction is distressed. FASB guidance in September "didn't accomplish what was necessary and we think this does not either," said Richard Jones, a partner at law firm Dechert Inc. in New York. Still, it is possible that more flexible accounting rules will allow banks to bite the bullet and sell their worst assets through federal programs. That is because they might have greater capacity to absorb the resulting losses thanks to more generous assessments of the value of other assets on their balance sheets. For example, if a bank holds $100 million in risky mortgage bonds on its books, which have already been written down to $50 million, but in most estimations are really worth $20 million. The bank may still be fearful of selling the assets at $20 million because of the new $30 million writedown it would have to make and its impact on capital ratios and earnings. However, if under eased FASB rules other less risky assets can be valued at $90 million, rather than $60 million through the current mark-to-market rules, then a cushion will have been created to ease the pain from the sale of the truly distressed securities. PRICE IS RIGHT? The success of the government's strategy to get the U.S. financial system running smoothly again hinges a lot on banks' willingness to sell poorly performing assets which have weighed on balance sheets and curbed the ability to lend. To some the accounting rules, even after the proposed changes, could be a barrier to that cleansing process. "Unless this gets fixed the way we think it ought to get fixed, it is going to significantly impair the effectiveness of (federal) programs because it will significantly impair the willingness of sellers to agree on prices," Dechert's Jones said on a Commercial Mortgage Securities Association call. Still, many analysts noted FASB has made a major step in the right direction. FASB staffers have also proposed revisions to another rule, FAS 115, that means companies may only have to take credit losses, and not declines in market value, onto their profit and loss statements. That can make a crucial difference to banks struggling to show they have enough capital and that they are on the path to recovery. The difference can be huge. For example, the Seattle Federal Home Loan Bank, on Monday said mark-to-market accounting forced it to write down $304 million on mortgage bonds in 2008 even though it intends to hold them to maturity. By contrast, the bank estimated credit losses on the bonds would be just $12 million. "It's the difference of the FHLB of Seattle of having profit reduced versus having substantial losses," said John von Seggern, president of the Council of FHLBanks in Washington.
