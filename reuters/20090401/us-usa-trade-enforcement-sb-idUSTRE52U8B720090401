 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The United States plans to step up enforcement of its trade agreements by prosecuting the worst barriers erected against American exports, U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk said on Tuesday. 

 Kirk, who took office less than two weeks ago, said U.S. trade officials are drawing up a list of the most significant trade barriers for prosecution through the World Trade Organization or the appropriate bilateral forum. "We must work to open new markets around the world for American farmers, manufacturers, ranchers and service providers, and at the same time ensure that American workers are reaping the promised benefits of previous agreements through strong enforcement," Kirk said in a statement. President Barack Obama has promised tougher enforcement of U.S. trade accords which many Democrats say was lacking during the administration of President George W. Bush. Kirk's comment accompanied the U.S. Trade Representative's annual report to Congress on foreign trade barriers. Examples of trade barriers that could be targeted for action include the slowing or blocking of imports with unjustified concerns about human, animal and plant health, discriminatory excise taxes on imported products, export subsidies for "national" brands, and limits on foreign participation in telecommunications markets, the USTR said. Kirk said he also will review agreements with U.S. free trade partners like Canada, Mexico, Chile, Australia, Peru, Bahrain, Morocco, Oman, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Costa Rica for possible violations, particularly of labor and environmental provisions. CHINA LESS OPEN The USTR focused much of its attention on China, which took up 55 pages of the 536-page report, more than for any other U.S. trading partner. It steered clear of any comment on China's currency, which many U.S. lawmakers believe Beijing keeps undervalued to give Chinese companies an unfair trade advantage. But USTR said it was concerned that since 2006 "China is trending toward a less open trade regime with diverse new measures that signal new restrictions on market access and foreign investment." Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus said the lengthy report showed "more countries are raising more barriers to American exports, investment and intellectual property rights." He said he would introduce trade legislation soon to beef up USTR's enforcement tools. Lawmakers in the House of Representatives also plan an enforcement bill this year. In a letter to Obama released on Monday, top Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee outlined more than two dozen trade barriers or foreign violations of trade rules that they said were ripe for litigation at the WTO or needed more intense U.S. pressure to resolve the problem. Roughly a third of the concerns were raised against Chinese trade practices, including China's "ongoing manipulation of its currency," its subsidies and export aid for manufacturers and its export taxes on industrial raw materials like steel wire that keep Chinese domestic prices low. The lawmakers also urged greater focus on barriers imposed in the name of food safety or plant health that they said are really just disguised measures to protect local producers. These include obstacles farmers face selling U.S. apples in China and cherries in Japan and South Korea, they said. With U.S. exports slumping due to the global financial crisis, the Obama administration needs a broader strategy to open markets, said Rep. Kevin Brady, a Texas Republican. "Our economy cannot grow on enforcement alone. It must be accompanied with an offensive game plan" that includes action by Congress on pending free trade agreements with Panama, Colombia and South Korea, Brady said in a speech.
