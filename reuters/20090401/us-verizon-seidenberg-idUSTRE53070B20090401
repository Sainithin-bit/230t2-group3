 LAS VEGAS  (Reuters) - Verizon Communications' ( VZ.N ) video, Internet and wireless businesses are growing despite the recession's impact on its traditional phone business and its enterprise segment, Verizon's top executive said at the CTIA annual wireless technology showcase. 

 Chief Executive Ivan Seidenberg said ahead of his keynote speech that while Verizon's enterprise business is "feeling some pressure" from the weak economy and access lines are declining, its FiOS video and high-speed Internet service is seeing growth. In his keynote speech, Seidenberg also said that wireless was also doing well despite the economy. "In an economy that seems to have forgotten how to grow, the mobile industry keeps reminding us," he said. The executive cited Nielsen Research that showed consumers spending 5 hours a day watching television, one hour surfing the web and 26 minutes using their mobile phones. "If we can get even a modest amount more of that use to mobile, we have more than enough room to grow," he said. (Reporting by  Sinead Carew ; editing by Gunna Dickson)
