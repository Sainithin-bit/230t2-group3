 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Worries about a rise in protectionist sentiment will be a priority for world leaders at a summit this week, but the United States is committed to keeping economic nationalism at bay, a senior White House aide said on Wednesday. 

 "On the basis of where we are now, I cannot believe that this is going to be a period of substantial retrenchment in economic nationalism and certainly all of us in the administration are going to do everything we can to make sure that doesn't happen," said Lawrence Summers, the director of the White House National Economic Council, at a bankers' conference.
