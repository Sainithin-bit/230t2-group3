 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Chrysler LLC's U.S. sales fell 39 percent in March as overall demand sagged with the United States engulfed in a deep recession. 

 Chrysler sold 101,001 vehicles in March compared with 166,386 in the same period a year ago, the company said in a release. The figures were not adjusted for the extra selling day in April 2008. The automaker said it decreased fleet sales 44 percent in March and continues to focus on showroom sales. "The market is starting to show small signs of life, which need to be nourished like seedlings," said Jim Press, vice chairman and president of Chrysler. The company extended its consumer incentive program, dubbed Employee Pricing Plus Plus, until April 30. The program offers employee pricing to all consumers along with interest-free loans for 48 months and cash discounts. Chrysler, which is seeking $5 billion in additional U.S. aid, said it has an 87-day supply of vehicles, or 349,612 units, a 17 percent decrease from a year ago.
