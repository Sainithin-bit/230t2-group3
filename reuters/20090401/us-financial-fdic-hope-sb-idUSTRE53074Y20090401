 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp on Wednesday expressed cautious optimism that the U.S. banking industry is improving but she still expects more pain, such as bank failures, to hit the industry. 

 "I see some glimmers of hope. I'm cautiously optimistic that the industry is getting on a better footing," FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair said at an American Bankers Association conference. "Many banks are making money." "But, as you know, there is still more pain to go," she said. The FDIC is bracing for a slew of bank failures. The insolvencies are expected to cost the agency about $65 billion in the next five years, Bair said, with most of the failures expected this year and next. To meet expected shortfalls in the industry-funded reserve, the FDIC recently announced it would charge banks higher premiums for insuring their depositors' accounts up to $250,000 per depositor. Regulators are considering ways to trim down such assessments, which according to banks are taking a toll on their profits at a time when they are struggling. Bair said fees from the FDIC debt guarantee program are likely to help lower insurance premiums. To help the FDIC bolster confidence in the banking system, U.S. lawmakers have proposed several pieces of legislation to increase the agency's borrowing authority with the Treasury Department. The Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday backed credit card legislation that included expanding the FDIC's line of credit to $100 billion from the current $30 billion and temporary authority for up to $500 billion for extraordinary circumstances. The committee's Democratic chairman, Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, also introduced a stand-alone bill to increase the FDIC's authority. The House of Representatives has similar legislation. Bair said she is also optimistic that Congress will soon give the FDIC more borrowing power. "An increase in borrowing authority is long overdue," she said. Bair said she didn't think a final decision on emergency assessments on the industry will be made until at least late May. The FDIC has also been at the center of a plan unveiled by Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner aimed at soaking up troubled assets from banks' balance sheets, with involvement of private investors. Bair said the program will be open to all big and small banks, focusing initially on the higher-risk assets such as mortgages and commercial real estate loans. She said her agency will guarantee the debt that is issued to finance the program. Community banks, however, are concerned that the big institutions will be given preference, and small banks might have to piggyback on the sale of assets by big banks. "I am concerned that, with respect to the Legacy Loan and Securities Program, the big banks may get priority over the smaller banks," said Chris Cole, senior regulatory counsel at the Independent Community Bankers of America trade group. The FDIC is accepting public comments on the program until April 10. "We think the program has a very good chance of succeeding," Bair said.
