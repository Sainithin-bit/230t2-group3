 BOSTON  (Reuters) - U.S. conglomerate General Electric Co ( GE.N ) and Intel Corp ( INTC.O ), the world's largest chip maker, have scheduled a joint press conference for Thursday, and are expected to discuss an alliance in health care, according to a source with knowledge of the plans. 

 The companies' respective chief executives, Jeff Immelt and Paul Otellini, are scheduled to discuss their tie up at an event in New York. The source requested anonymity because he was unauthorized to speak publicly about the matter. A GE spokesman declined to disclose details of the announcement ahead of the event. Intel officials confirmed that Otellini would be present but provided no further detail. GE's health care unit makes medical imaging devices as well as systems for managing patient records electronically. GE's healthcare arm, which Immelt headed before taking on the top job, last year earned $2.9 billion on $17.4 billion in sales. (Reporting by  Scott Malone , editing by Leslie Gevirtz)
