 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Many investors bought put options and sold expensive calls in several key bank stocks on Tuesday on the view that the financial sector's problems might be accelerating despite massive bailout efforts. 

 Steep declines in the stock prices of Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo & Co and PNC Financial Services Group Inc attracted put buying across the board as investors considered the deepening implications of State Street Corp's dismal fourth- quarter results. Investors often turn to equity put options, conveying the right to sell a company's stock at a fixed price and date, to protect their holdings or speculate on more share losses. "We are seeing big declines in the financial sector on fears that the problems in the banking industry are far from over, and may be getting worse despite government efforts to raise capital levels with the rescue package," said Frederic Ruffy, options strategist at Web site WhatsTrading.com. Newly sworn-in U.S. President Barack Obama promised "bold and swift" action to revive the struggling economy but did not delve into specifics about his proposed $825 billion economic stimulus package. State Street, the world's largest money manager for institutions, reported billions of dollars of unrealized investment losses and a sharp drop in quarterly profit on Tuesday, driving its stock down as much as 58 percent. Royal Bank of Scotland added to the woes after posting the biggest loss in British corporate history on Monday, when U.S. stock markets were shut for the Martin Luther King, Jr., holiday. "After the surprising news in State Street and Royal Bank of Scotland, the view is that not only is this financial crisis not over, but it may be even deeper than anyone originally thought," said Joe Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at online brokerage thinkorswim Group. BUYING 'DISASTER INSURANCE' In Bank of America, Kinahan said he saw a step up in the demand for February $5 and $6 put options, giving the right to sell Bank of America shares at $5 and $6 apiece. Its stock fell nearly 28 percent to $5.20 in late afternoon trade. Kinahan also noted players in Citigroup purchased the Feb $3 and $4 puts. And He cited active trading in Wells Fargo February $10, 12 and $15 put options. Citigroup's stock dropped almost 18 percent to $2.88, while Wells Fargo stock sank 22.6 percent to $14.46. Deep out-of-the-money puts -- notably the February $15, $12.50 and $10 strikes -- were bought in PNC Financial as some investors purchased very cheap premiums or "disaster insurance" on concerns about further fallout, Ruffy said. PNC's stock plunged 40.8 percent to $22.24. "Investors also sold call options in PNC Financial expiring in February at the $35 and $40 strikes on expectations that those calls would expire worthless following today's loss of one-third of its market cap", said Andrew Wilkinson, senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers Group in Greenwich, Connecticut. Even in the diverse portfolio of financial stocks represented by the Financial Select Sector SPDR exchange-traded fund, put activity was very heavy. XLF shares fell 14.6 percent to $8.24 after hitting a new low of $8.18. Wilkinson noticed significant XLF put activity in the March contract in the $4, $5 and $6 strikes, with volume of more than 80,000 contracts at the lowest $4 strike. "This appears to be fresh investor positioning extending their bearish views," Wilkinson said. (Reporting by Doris Frankel; Editing by  Jan Paschal )
