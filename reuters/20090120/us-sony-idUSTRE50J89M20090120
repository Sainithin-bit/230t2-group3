 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Sony Corp ( 6758.T ) is preparing to announce on Wednesday or Thursday details of its December restructuring plan, including where job cuts will fall, the Financial Times reported. 

 The newspaper said Chief Executive Howard Stringer was facing resistance to cutting jobs in the electronics division and in Japan. Sony unveiled plans last month that called for curbing investment, exiting businesses and cutting 16,000 jobs. A source has also said that Sony will likely suffer an annual operating loss of about $1.1 billion, its first such loss in 14 years, due to sluggish sales and a stronger yen.
