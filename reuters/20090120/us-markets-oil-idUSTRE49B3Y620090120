 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oil prices jumped 6 percent on Tuesday as traders sought to square their books ahead of the expiry of the February U.S. futures contract. 

 U.S. February crude, which expired on Tuesday, settled up $2.23 at $38.74 a barrel, while March crude fell $1.73 to $40.84 a barrel. London Brent fell 88 cents to settle at $43.62 a barrel. "There's a short-squeeze play going on ahead of February crude's expiration as there are still some traders heavy with shorts on this last trading day for the contract," said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Alaron Trading in Chicago. "The market is also filling the gap between the February and March contract, one activity which we saw in the last two contract expirations, and so we are seeing a narrowing of the February/March contract." Slumping demand in the United States and Europe has helped send crude prices down from record highs above $147 a barrel in July, prompting the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree to a series of output cuts aimed at balancing the market and supporting prices. Kuwait has informed all customers of cuts in oil supply in line with OPEC's December decision to reduce supply, state oil company Kuwait Petroleum Corp said. OPEC's new president, Botelho de Vasconcelos, told Reuters the group was fully enforcing its deepest ever supply curbs, adding that the cartel was unlikely to meet before its next scheduled meeting in Vienna in March. "The OPEC cuts are stabilizing the markets, even if they are not making it go up very much," said Christopher Bellew, a broker at Bache Commodities in London. China, one engine in the six-year commodity price rally that started in 2002, was expected to release fourth-quarter GDP data this week that economists say will show 7.0 percent growth, the slowest pace of expansion in nearly a decade for the world's third-biggest economy. Russian gas reached Europe via Ukraine for the first time in two weeks after Moscow and Kiev ended a contract dispute that had cut supplies to about 20 European countries. A Reuters poll of analysts taken ahead of weekly U.S. inventory data on Thursday forecast crude oil stocks in the world's biggest consumer rose by 1.4 million barrels last week, with distillate stocks seen down due to cold winter weather.
