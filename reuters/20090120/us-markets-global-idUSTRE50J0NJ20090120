 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Mounting fears about banks and the global economy pushed stocks sharply lower around the world on Tuesday, giving newly elected U.S. President Barack Obama a grim reminder of the difficulties his administration faces. 

 U.S. and euro zone government bonds fell over worries about the increased supply that will be needed to fund the mounting debt that governments will take on for financial sector bailouts and to lift economies from a sharp worldwide downturn. Concern that the euro zone will suffer a deep recession cut the euro to a six-week low against the dollar. The euro traded below $1.2900 for the first time since December 10. The pound fell to a 7-1/2-year low after the Royal Bank of Scotland on Monday announced the biggest loss in British corporate history, setting a negative tone for the financial sector both in Europe and the United States. U.S. bank shares plummeted after State Street Corp, the world's biggest money manager for institutions, said it needs to raise capital. Stock in State Street lost about half its value while shares of Bank of America and Citigroup fell to their lowest levels since the early 1990s. European banking shares also fell heavily, with Lloyds Bank sliding 31 percent, Barclays down 17 percent and both BNP Paribas and Societe Generale off 13 percent. "Once you have lost confidence, it takes four to five times longer to regain confidence," said Franz Wenzel, strategist at AXA Investment Managers in Paris. The environment remains shaky and more write-downs from bad loans are likely from last year's fourth quarter and the first quarter of 2009, Wenzel said. The RBS loss "just goes to underscore that the financial sector globally is under a lot of pressure and creating a lot of sovereign problems," said Gail Dudack, chief investment strategist at Dudack Research Group in New York. Before 1 p.m., the Dow Jones industrial average was down 147.66 points, or 1.78 percent, at 8,133.56. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was down 21.40 points, or 2.52 percent, at 828.72. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 47.78 points, or 3.12 percent, at 1,481.55. In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares closed down 2.12 percent, or 16.75 points, at 774.48. Amid the economic gloom and ongoing financial woes, the dollar benefited from flight-to-quality bids and hopes Obama will soon lead the United States out of a year-long recession that looms as the worst since the Great Depression. The dollar rose against a basket of major currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index up 0.87 percent at 85.879. Against the yen, the dollar fell 0.56 percent at 90.16. The euro fell 1.19 percent at $1.2954. "The inauguration is crystallizing all expectations that the U.S. economy will be the first to recover from the recession," said Marco Annunziata, global chief economist at UniCredit, Italy's second-biggest bank, in London. Bond prices fell. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was down 36/32 in price to yield 2.46 percent. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond was down 100/32 in price to yield 3.05 percent. In Europe, investors demanded record high premiums to buy several non-benchmark German debt on worries there could be more downgrades after Standard & Poor's cut the credit ratings of both Spain and Greece recently. Oil reversed losses and climbed above $37 a barrel on wintry weather in the northern hemisphere and reports that OPEC was tightening supply. Crude had fallen more than $3 after Russia's Gazprom resumed pumping gas into Ukraine on its way to Europe, ending an increased need for oil products to replace gas. U.S. light sweet crude oil rose $1.67 to $38.18 a barrel. Spot gold prices rose $23.05 to $858.45 an ounce. Daniel Smith, a Standard Chartered analyst, said strong investor flows into gold-linked products such as exchange-traded funds offset weaker jewelry demand. "People are slowly building long positions in gold and commodities more generally," Smith said. The MSCI index for Asia-Pacific stocks outside Japan slid 3.2 percent. Japan's Nikkei fell 2.3 percent.
