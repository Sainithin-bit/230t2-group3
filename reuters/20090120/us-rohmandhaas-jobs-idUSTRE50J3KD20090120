 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Rohm and Haas Co ROH.N said on Tuesday it plans to cut 900 jobs, or 5.5 percent of its workforce, in a bid to tackle the slump in demand and widespread market weakness. 

 The chemical maker, which is in the process of being acquired by Dow Chemical Co ( DOW.N ), said the moves build on the restructuring actions the company announced in June 2008. At the time, Rohm and Haas said it would reduce production and cut about 925 jobs. The new round of restructuring and job cuts is expected to generate about $90 million in annualized savings. The actions will also result in $90 million in pre-tax restructuring and asset impairment charges in the fourth quarter of 2008. The company also expects adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2008 to exceed the current analyst consensus estimate. Analysts, on average, have forecast fourth quarter earnings of 64 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. The company plans to adjust production schedules in certain manufacturing facilities, reducing sales and marketing positions and freezing discretionary spending and employee salaries, where possible. Rohm and Haas and its peers have been reeling from a sharp slump in demand for chemical products, due to a fall in consumer spending, tight credit conditions and a widening global recession. "Our actions today are intended to adjust our operations to current business conditions, which reflect softening markets worldwide," said Chief Operating Officer Pierre Brondeau, in a statement. Shares of Rohm and Haas fell 1 percent to $60.00 in early trade on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by  Euan Rocha ; Editing by  Derek Caney )
