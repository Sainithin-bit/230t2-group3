 BOSTON  (Reuters) - IBM issued a 2009 profit outlook that blew past Wall Street expectations, underscoring the ability of the world's top technology services firm to weather the global downturn and boosting its shares 4 percent. 

 The fourth-quarter earnings of International Business Machines Corp also trumped analysts' expectations on Tuesday, presenting a rare bright spot for the tech industry, which has been hit by profit warnings and sweeping job cuts as companies and consumers reduce spending. Although IBM's fourth-quarter revenue came in a little shy of expectations, falling 6.4 percent from a year ago, the company also managed to cut costs by 3-4 percent. A lower tax rate also helped. "IBM clearly is watching their expenses closely, which we believe is very important in the environment," said Andy Miedler, analyst at Edward Jones. "IBM can't control its revenue in this environment so they're focusing on cost control .... IBM clearly has a management team that over the long term has proven they can manage this business in good and bad economic times." Chief Executive Samuel Palmisano said IBM is "ahead of pace" on its plan to boost earnings to $10 to $11 per share by 2010. That is more optimistic than its assessment in October, when it said it was on pace to meet that goal. The company -- which competes with the likes of Hewlett-Packard Co, Microsoft Corp, Oracle Corp and SAP -- posted a gross profit margin of 47.9 percent, up 3 percentage points from a year earlier. Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said the firm will keep improving margins. "We will continue our focus on structural changes that reduce our spending levels and improve productivity in 2009," Loughridge said on a conference call. Those efforts include standardizing services products so they are less costly to deliver to IBM's customers, which are predominantly among the world's biggest corporations. The company will also shift staff from headquarters to local offices where they can meet directly with clients. 2009 FORECAST BEATS ESTIMATES IBM, the world's biggest manufacturer of mainframe computers and No. 2 software maker, predicted 2009 earnings of least $9.20 a share, handily trouncing a consensus of $8.77 according to Reuters Estimates. "The market is exhaling," said Keith Wirtz, chief investment officer for Fifth Third Asset Management. "The market has been holding its breath to see if it would be close." "IBM has enjoyed certain attributes that other tech stocks don't enjoy. They have recurring revenue streams that also translate into profitability," he said. The Armonk, New York company said net income rose 12 percent to $4.43 billion, or $3.28 per share, in the fourth quarter ended December 31, from $3.95 billion, or $2.80 per share, a year earlier. That easily beat the average analyst forecast of $3.03. Revenue fell 6.4 percent to $27.0 billion, but turnover in its software segment climbed 3 percent to $6.4 billion. It signed services contracts totaling $17.2 billion, at actual rates, a decrease of 5 percent. But its backlog of services bookings rose to a currency-adjusted $117 billion at the end of December, up $3 billion from the end of September. IBM shares climbed to 85.25 in after-hours trade from a regular close of $81.98 on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has dropped about 16 percent over the past year, less than half the 36 percent drop in the Nasdaq Composite Index. Shares of Microsoft are down about 41 percent, while Hewlett-Packard Co's stock has fallen 22 percent over the same period. (Writing by  Edwin Chan , editing by Tiffany Wu,  Richard Chang )
