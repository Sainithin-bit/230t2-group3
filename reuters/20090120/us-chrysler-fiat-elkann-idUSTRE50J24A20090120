 MILAN  (Reuters) - Fiat's ( FIA.MI ) talks with troubled U.S. car maker Chrysler are "not a mystery," the main shareholder of the Italian group said on Tuesday. 

 "That we are talking is not a mystery," John Elkann told reporters on the sidelines of a business event. Fiat's shares were suspended from trade on Tuesday pending a statement following news that the group was in talks to form a partnership with Chrysler that could see Fiat take a stake in the U.S. car maker. Elkann is the great-great grandson of Fiat's founder and head of the holding company that manages the Agnelli family's wealth, including a more than 30 percent stake in Fiat.
