 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Germany's BMW ( BMWG.DE ), the world's largest premium car maker, is looking into applying for state guarantees to back up its borrowings, the Bild Zeitung newspaper reported on Tuesday. 

 BMW was not immediately available for comment on the report. The car maker would become the second manufacturer in Germany to seek state aid after Volkswagen ( VOWG.DE ) sought guarantees for its financial divisions to cover refinancing of car loans in December. Germany's carmakers are suffering from collapsing global demand. (Reporting by  Eva Kuehnen , editing by Dan Lalor)
