 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Group 1 Automotive Chief Executive Earl Hesterberg said on Tuesday that sales at the dealership group's Chrysler stores have been challenging and it is too soon to know how the automaker's partnership with Fiat will affect dealers. 

 "It's premature for us to say anything," Hesterberg told reporters on the sidelines of the Automotive News World Congress. "Obviously we are interested in anything that increases the viability of the Chrysler, Jeep, Dodge network." Hesterberg said he had not yet heard details about the agreement or whether it would help make the automaker viableGroup 1 has seven dealerships for Chrysler that encompass all three of its Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep brands. Sales at those stores have fared better than Chrysler sales overall mainly due to their location in areas where truck sales are traditionally strong, the decline in gas prices from their peaks and introduction of a redesigned Dodge Ram, he said. Chrysler's U.S. sales fell 30 percent in 2008, including a 53 percent drop in December. "It is still a significant decrease year-over-year," Hesterberg said of the sales at Group 1's Chrysler dealers. "It's been a challenge to keep all of those dealerships viable." As for U.S. sales overall, Hesterberg said he has seen little change from the selling rates in the fourth quarter. "I can't see any appreciable difference in the selling rate versus the last three months, nothing a lot better, nothing a lot worse," he said. Hesterberg said Group 1 has seen sales leaning more toward SUVs and big trucks and from cars in the last two or three months, market segments where dealers traditionally have generated more profits per vehicle than in the sale of cars. But an overstock on inventory nationwide has put downward pressure on margins overall, Hesterberg said. "Whatever good there may be from a shift in per unit profit to trucks from cars, is at least being offset by everyone being overstocked and having to move inventory and get it off their lots," Hesterberg said. Last week, Group 1 said it planned to scale back orders for new vehicles and would reduce pay for its top executives in response to the severe downturn in the U.S. auto market that has increased the inventory of unsold vehicles. U.S. auto sales fell 18 percent to about 13.2 million vehicles in 2008 from the prior year, battered by the downturn in the economy and most automakers expect sales to decline further in 2009. The rate has hovered just above 10 million on an annualized basis in the last few months. (Reporting by  David Bailey ; Editing by Phil Berlowitz,  Leslie Gevirtz )
