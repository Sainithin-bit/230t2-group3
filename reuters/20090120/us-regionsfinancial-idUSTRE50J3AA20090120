 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Regions Financial Corp, a large U.S. Southeast regional bank, reported an unexpected $6.22 billion quarterly loss, reflecting a huge writeoff for its banking business and a surge in soured real estate loans, especially in Florida. 

 The Birmingham, Alabama-based lender said it took a $6 billion non-cash goodwill writedown because the value of its banking and Treasury operations had fallen below book value, following two large mergers earlier this decade. The writedown resulted in a fourth-quarter net loss of $9.01 per share, compared with a profit of $70.6 million, or 10 cents per share, a year earlier. Regions' operating loss was 35 cents per share as the lender more than tripled the amount it set aside for bad loans. On that basis, analysts on average expected a loss of 20 cents per share, Reuters Estimates said. "There is no quick fix for credit quality issues that are plaguing the financial services industry," Chief Executive Dowd Ritter said on a conference call. "This is by far the most difficult credit cycle that we have ever witnessed." Most U.S. banks are adding reserves as defaults grow on real estate and other loans, and unemployment rises. Regional banks are expected to report dismal quarterly results this month, after Bank of America Corp and Citigroup Inc posted huge losses last week while JPMorgan Chase & Co posted a 76 percent decline in profit. Shares of Regions fell $1.18, or 19.4 percent, to $4.89 in morning trading amid broad declines in the banking sector. The lender's $5.9 billion merger with Memphis-based Union Planters Corp in 2004 and $10 billion purchase of Birmingham's AmSouth Bancorp Inc in 2006 transformed it into a big regional lender, now with $146.2 billion of assets and 1,900 branches in 16 U.S. states across the South, Midwest and Texas. 9 PERCENT OF LOANS "STRESSED" Regions set aside $1.15 billion in the fourth quarter for credit losses, up from $358 million a year earlier. Net charge-offs surged to $796 million from $107.5 million. The bank said 9 percent of its loans were "stressed," with particular trouble among residential homebuilders; home equity loans, mainly in Florida; and condominiums. It also reported "emerging stress" in Florida residential first mortgage and retail commercial real estate. Regions nevertheless said it remained well capitalized, in part reflecting a recent $3.5 billion infusion from the U.S. Treasury Department's Troubled Asset Relief Program. Chief Financial Officer Irene Esteves said Regions does not expect to need new capital from the government, and Ritter said he has given "absolutely no thought" to disposing of the Morgan Keegan asset management unit, which he called "integral." Through Friday, Regions shares had fallen 70 percent in the last year, compared with a 61 percent decline in the KBW Bank Index.
