 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Auto parts suppliers need between $5 billion to $10 billion in government aid to survive a "cash crisis" in the next few months, a leading supplier executive said on Tuesday. 

 Dura Automotive Systems Inc Chief Executive Tim Leuliette said the supply base faces severe borrowing issues in February and emergency government funding is critical to support the industry's short-term liquidity needs. "Financing is drying up. We find financing institutions not wanting to work with automotive. Banks wouldn't return your calls," Leuliette said at the Automotive News World Congress in Detroit. General Motors Corp and Chrysler LLC have stepped up restructuring actions, including production cuts, after the government appropriated $17.4 billion of loans in December. As a result of the steep output reductions by nearly all automakers in the United States, suppliers are expected to receive $5 billion to $7 billion in payments from automakers for parts deliveries in February, down from the usual $12 to $15 billion, Leuliette said. "That cash is gone. And suppliers need this liquidity ... It can be TARP money; it can be anything you want," Leuliette said. He was referring to the Troubled Asset Relief Program, the U.S. government rescue package for the financial industry. "We're talking $5-10 billion," Leuliette said. Leuliette said Dura has removed about 3,500 people from its payroll during the current industry downturn. In January, the supplier laid off almost all its staff for a week. "We can't just keep people hanging around waiting, so unfortunately we're all taking these actions. When your customers are down, you just have to shut it down."
