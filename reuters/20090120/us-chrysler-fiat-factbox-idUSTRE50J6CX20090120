 (Reuters) - Italy's Fiat, which needs a partner to survive the auto crisis, has agreed to take a 35 percent stake in the No. 3 U.S. car maker Chrysler. 

 Here are some key statistics about the two groups: FIAT * Key car brands are Fiat, Lancia and Alfa Romeo. * Also owns luxury sports car makers Ferrari and Maserati. * Has a market capitalization of about $7.5 billion. * Trading profit for the entire group including Iveco trucks and CNH tractors was 802 million euros ($1.04 billion) in the third quarter on sales of 14.3 billion euros, up from 13.9 billion a year earlier. * Main markets are Europe and Brazil. Nearly all of the profit for Fiat Auto comes from Brazil. * Founded in 1899 and steered from 1902 by Giovanni Agnelli whose grandson Gianni, chairman from 1966, was a legend of Italy's corporate scene, known as much for his society lifestyle as his business acumen. * Has struck a series of alliances with other manufacturers, including India's Tata and China's Chery. * In 2000, in the midst of a debt crisis, Fiat struck a deal with General Motors in which the U.S. car maker took a stake. The agreement was dissolved in 2005. * Current chief executive Sergio Marchionne took over in 2004 and put in place a plan to turn the car maker around which was successful, but the company has suffered like others in the current global crisis. CHRYSLER * Third-largest car maker in the United States * Founded in 1925. * Three brands include Dodge, Chrysler and Jeep. * Bought by Germany's Daimler in 1998 in a $36 billion deal. * Daimler sold 80.1 percent of Chrysler in 2007 to Cerberus Capital Management LP for $7.4 billion. * Daimler retains a 19.9 percent stake which it said on Tuesday it still wanted to sell. It has been in talks with Cerberus about the stake. * In October, Chrysler held merger talks with GM, sources familiar with the situation said. * Chrysler has taken $4 billion from the U.S. government as a loan to help it cope with the current global crisis and has also received $1.5 billion for its finance arm.
