 (Reuters) - American International Group Inc ( AIG.N ) Chief Investment Officer Win Neuger will step down from his post and focus on a narrower role at the company, the Wall Street Journal said, citing people familiar with the matter. 

 An announcement is expected in coming days that Neuger, who has been the insurer's chief investment officer for years, will leave that job, according to the paper. Neuger will continue to oversee AIG's business of managing assets for external clients such as pension funds, and will also keep his titles as chief executive and chairman of AIG Investments, the paper said. AIG could not be immediately reached for comment by Reuters. AIG, once the world's biggest insurer by market value, averted bankruptcy in September last year with an $85 billion federal bailout, which later swelled to about $152 billion. The company has started selling assets to raise funds to repay a part of the government bailout. (Reporting by  Bijoy Koyitty  in Bangalore; Editing by  Lincoln Feast )
