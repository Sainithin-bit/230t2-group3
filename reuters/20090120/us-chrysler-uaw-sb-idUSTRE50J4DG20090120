 DETROIT  (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers union on Tuesday offered its support for the alliance between Fiat SpA and Chrysler LLC, saying the tie-up has the potential to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs. 

 UAW President Ron Gettelfinger said in a statement issued by the union that the alliance "offers Chrysler new opportunities to compete in the U.S. market and the global marketplace." "As the U.S. auto industry undergoes a restructuring process, this alliance has the potential to preserve a wide range of choices for U.S. consumers, as well as good-paying manufacturing jobs for our communities," said Gettelfinger. UAW Vice President General Holiefield, who heads the union's negotiations with Chrysler, said the union would work with both Chrysler and Fiat in the coming weeks. "UAW members will have a voice as this new alliance takes shape," he said. Under the deal announced on Tuesday, Fiat would take a 35 percent stake in Chrysler in exchange for sharing its small car technology with the struggling U.S. automaker.
