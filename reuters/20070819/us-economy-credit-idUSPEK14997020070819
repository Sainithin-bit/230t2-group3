 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Global investors will likely remain wary this week as uncertainty about the credit crisis persists, even after the U.S. Federal Reserve in a rare move last week slashed the rate it charges banks on loans and encouraged more borrowing. 

 Even if financial markets show signs of stability after stocks in Europe and on Wall Street rallied on Friday, central banks around the world now seem to be worried about the impact on growth from a crisis that began in the U.S. market for risky mortgages and spread like a virus. "It's too early to say that we have seen the worst of it," said Naomi Fink, currency strategist with BNP Paribas in New York. "The Fed's action signaled that there was concern that markets would not resolve the jitters themselves." Asian stock markets could be in store for a rebound on Monday after the Fed's action but investors by no means believed the time was ripe to again dive back into risky, high-yielding investments. Futures for the Nikkei Japanese stock average traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange pared big losses on Friday after the Fed cut a key interest rate but still pointed to a lower open. Also, not even 24 hours after the Fed tried to shore up confidence in the credit market of the world's largest economy, Sentinel Management Group Inc filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection late on Friday. The cash management firm serving the U.S. futures industry had decided to freeze client accounts on Tuesday, a move that roiled the markets. "I don't think we've solved all the credit market problems with this move from the Fed," said Michael James, senior trader at regional investment bank Wedbush Morgan in Los Angeles. The Dow Jones industrial average snapped a 6-day losing streak on Friday, rising 233.30 points, or 1.8 percent, to 13,079.08. Investors remained nervous, although Fred Dickson, market strategist and director of retail research at D.A. Davidson & Co., expected market volatility to ease with a quiet week ahead for economic and corporate news. "I'd say the market should begin to settle down and feel a little bit easier that the Fed at least has shown they're willing to react to market conditions," said Dickson. However, "the Fed action is basically a short-term Band-aid," he noted. "The real question is what will happen next, because there will be more credit-related problems in the coming weeks." Dickson said Hurricane Dean, which hit Jamaica's southern coast on Sunday, would also raise concerns, potentially driving up energy prices and putting pressure on the stock market. Swiss central bank President Jean-Pierre Roth said in a newspaper interview on Sunday that the end of higher market volatility was not near, and central banks should not seek to eliminate market volatility; otherwise markets risk becoming a one-way street leading to excess. THE MORTGAGE WORLD'S 'KATRINA' For the first time since the September 11, 2001 attacks crippled the U.S. financial system, the Fed on Friday cut its discount rate between regular policy meetings by a half percentage point, although it left its benchmark lending rate untouched at 5.25 percent. And just 10 days after the Fed had said that economic growth was likely to continue at a moderate pace, it acknowledged market conditions had deteriorated so much that they threatened the economy. To be fair, during those 10 days market volatility -- as measured by the VIX index -- had shot up 43 percent, the Standard & Poor's 500 index had fallen 4.4 percent and the yen had jumped 4 percent against the dollar. Also, the Fed, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan and others had spent the last two weeks pumping billions of dollars of short-term loans into markets in an effort to jump start liquidity, which had dried up as banks focused more on their own subprime exposure. Still, central bankers seem to be profoundly reassessing their policy plans in light of the unfolding credit crisis. "The fact that unprecedented liquidity has led to an almost indiscriminate investment in all things high yield is the concern of all central banks," said BNP's Fink. One of the most dominant trading strategies in current markets is the carry trade, in which investors borrow cheaply in one country to buy higher-yielding assets in another. But the spike in volatility and pullback in risk taking has bloodied the popular strategy. The carry trade issue will continue to have an impact on the markets in the next few weeks, said Dickson. "We will continue to see hedge funds scramble to unwind carry trade positions and also to meet redemptions," he said. "And that hangs over the market." Managed futures funds group John W. Henry said in a statement posted on its Web site that currency trading in July was unprofitable with the firm's largest loss in the Japanese yen. The Japanese yen has surged to 14-month highs against the dollar. Analysts see the dollar pushing below the psychologically important 110 yen level in weeks to come. In currency markets on Sunday, the dollar fell 0.2 percent from late Friday to 114.04 yen, still well off the lows of 111.60 yen reached last week. The Australian dollar, popular with carry traders, was off 0.4 percent at 0.7950. The credit crisis has even spilled over into Main Street. Democratic contenders for U.S. President on Sunday were asked what could be done to foment the growing storm. Some said increased transparency of hedge funds and private equity firms would help and all said vaguely that more liquidity is needed. New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson called the crisis the "the Katrina of the mortgage-lending industry," referring to the hurricane that leveled New Orleans and caused widespread criticism of the Bush administration for acting too late.
