 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Prices of existing U.S. single-family homes extended declines in July, while home prices in 10 large cities suffered their sharpest annual fall in 16 years, according to the Standard & Poor's/Case Shiller national home price index on Tuesday. 

 S&P said its composite month-over-month index of 10 metro areas declined 0.6 percent in July for a 4.5 percent year-over-year drop. It was the steepest rate of decline since July 1991, when the economy was emerging from recession. The composite month-over-month index of 20 metropolitan areas fell 0.4 percent in July from June, bringing the measure down 3.9 percent from a year earlier. Both the 10- and 20-city composite indexes have registered falling prices since the start of this year. Bloated inventories of new and existing homes for sale and tight credit conditions are souring the outlook for the already weak U.S. housing market, economists said. Home builders are leading the price cuts as they struggle to pare expensive inventories. Separate data from the National Association of Realtors on Tuesday showed existing single-family homes for sale increased to a 10 months' supply in August. For data, see <ID:nWAT008153>. "It's pretty clear the trend is down and with inventories of vacant homes for sale as high as they are I don't expect the trend to end any time soon," said James O'Sullivan, an economist at UBS Securities LLC in Stamford, Connecticut. Prices may fall more than 10 percent from their peak by next year, he said. Home builder Lennar Corp ( LEN.N ) on Tuesday posted the biggest loss in its history in the third quarter, blaming drops in existing and new home prices. The Dow Jones U.S. Home Construction .DJUSHB fell 3.7 percent to 349.38 in late-morning in New York. It earlier fell to 346.89, the lowest intraday level since April 2003. Of the 20 cities followed by S&P/Case-Shiller, Tampa, Florida, and Detroit saw the worst price declines over the past year at 8.8 percent and 9.7 percent, respectively. Price increases over the past year were seen in just four of the 20 cities: Atlanta; Dallas; Charlotte, North Carolina; and Portland, Oregon. The drop in August home sales coincides with a sharp drop in lending that came as many mortgage and other credit markets seized around the world. Soaring delinquencies and banking woes led investors to pull back on funding for nearly all mortgages that were not eligible for guarantee by Fannie Mae FNM.N, Freddie Mac FRE.N or the government "This decline represents the leading edge of housing data that reflects the credit crunch and almost certainly indicates more weakness to come," economists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a note to clients. Futures contracts on the CME Group exchange in Chicago indicated traders anticipate another 5 percent to 10 percent drop in most of the 20 markets over the next year, Robert Shiller, chief economist at MacroMarkets LLC in Madison, New Jersey, and a founder of the indexes, said in an e-mail.
