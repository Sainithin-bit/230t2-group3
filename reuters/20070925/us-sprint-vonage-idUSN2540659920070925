 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A U.S. federal court jury found that Vonage ( VG.N ) infringed on six Sprint Nextel Corp S.N> patents, according to Sprint spokesman Matt Sullivan. 

 Sprint sued Vonage in 2005, making 61 claims of violations of seven patents related to telecommunications technology. A U.S. District Court had rejected Vonage's motion to dismiss the case last month. (Reporting by  Sinead Carew )
