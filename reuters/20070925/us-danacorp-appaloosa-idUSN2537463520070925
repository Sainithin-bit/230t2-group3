 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Hedge fund Appaloosa Management LP's bid for bankrupt auto parts supplier Dana Corp could be scuttled by the strike against General Motors Corp, according to a regulatory filing. 

 Appaloosa, a hedge fund, said in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Tuesday that its offer for Dana could be conditioned on there not being a strike at any of the major U.S. automakers. According to the filing, the offer letter was delivered to Dana on Friday. On Monday, the United Auto Workers union struck all U.S. plants of General Motors Corp. "Appaloosa proposes to include an additional closing condition to the effect that there shall not have occurred any material strike or labor stoppage or slowdown at the company, General Motors, Chrysler, Ford Motor Co or any of their respective subsidiaries," the hedge fund said in the SEC filing. The UAW is also currently in contract talks with Ford and Chrysler LLC. Dana shares fell about 21 percent, or 6 cents, to 22.5 cents on the Pink Sheets. A Dana spokesman referred questions to Appaloosa. Appaloosa officials declined comment. Appaloosa, which holds a 15 percent stake in Dana, has been bidding against Centerbridge Capital Partners. A bankruptcy judge in July approved that company's $750 million investment plan in Dana, which Appaloosa has criticized as inadequate. Appaloosa also said its offer differed from Centerbridge's in that it carries no break-up fee. (Reporting by  Scott Malone , editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
