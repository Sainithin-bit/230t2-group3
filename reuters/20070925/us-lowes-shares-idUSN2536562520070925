 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Lowe's Cos Inc ( LOW.N ) shares fell more than 6 percent on Tuesday after the home improvement retailer cut its profit forecast for this year amid the slumping U.S. housing market. 

 Other retailers and home-related stocks fell as the warning and news of a slide in U.S. existing-home sales suggested the housing sector still faces challenges. A warning by Target Corp ( TGT.N ) that sales for September at stores opened at least a year would be well below a prior forecast also helped chill retail stocks. "It's the continuing uncertainty due to the housing market," said Nick McCoy, senior consultant with TNS Retail Forward. "Consumers are just nervous right now and hesitant to spend money." Lowe's said on Monday that earnings for the year ending in February could be at the low end or slightly below a range of $1.97 to $2.01 a share it forecast in August. Analysts were expecting profit of $1.99 a share, flat with the year before, according to Reuters Estimates. Lowe's, the No. 2 home improvement retailer behind Home Depot Inc ( HD.N ), said droughts in some parts of the United States were hurting sales, which were already under pressure from the housing woes. "I believe the Lowe's weakness is due to the weak housing environment," Gabelli & Co analyst Zahid Siddique told Reuters in an e-mail. "I expect home retailers to continue to struggle in the near- to mid-term." Lowe's told its analyst meeting on Tuesday that it will open 135 to 145 stores in North America annually from 2008 through 2010, down from the 150 to 155 stores it plans for this year. It also said it was testing smaller-store formats and a two-level store. The "sales environment does remain challenging," as consumers continue to put off big-ticket projects such as kitchen renovations, Lowe's Chairman and Chief Executive Robert Niblock told the Webcast analyst meeting. Problems in the subprime-mortgage sector that caters to borrowers with poor credit have slowed the U.S. housing market. Declining home sales and construction have hurt results at Lowe's, Home Depot and other home-goods companies. "You can't turn on the TV without hearing bad news about the economy," McCoy said. "The Fed lowered interest rates, but that's going to take time to have some effect." For example, McCoy said the strike by 73,000 workers that began on Monday at automaker General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) did not bode well for the wider economy. The National Association of Realtors reported on Tuesday that U.S. existing-home sales fell 4.3 percent in August from the month before, while a Conference Board survey showed consumer confidence fell in September to its lowest point in nearly two years on growing concern about jobs and financial market turmoil. Mooresville, North Carolina-based Lowe's told analysts it expects sales at stores open at least a year to decline 2 percent to 3 percent this year and be "flattish" in 2008. Per-share profit growth should average 12 percent to 15 percent per year from 2008 through 2010, while total sales will rise 8 percent to 11 percent a year during that time, it said. Target said on Monday it expected same-store sales to rise between 1.5 percent and 2.5 percent for the five weeks ending October 6, well down from an earlier forecast for a 4 percent to 6 percent rise. Atlanta-based Home Depot said earlier this month it expects per-share profit to decline 7 percent to 9 percent this year. Lowe's shares fell $2.04, or 6.7 percent, to close at $28.51 on the New York Stock Exchange, while Home Depot shed 80 cents, or 2.4 percent, to $33.08. Other stocks with ties to housing also sank, as furniture maker La-Z-Boy ( LZB.N ) was off 71 cents, or 8.1 percent, to $8.03, while appliance maker Whirlpool Corp ( WHR.N ) dropped $4.47, or 4.9 percent, to $86.83. Retailer Macy's Inc ( M.N ) fell $1.04, or 3.2 percent, to $31.91 and Sears Holdings Corp ( SHLD.O ) hit a new year low, falling $4.56, or 3.5 percent, to  $124.27. (Reporting by Karen Jacobs)
