 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Negotiators from General Motors Corp and the United Auto Workers union adjourned talks on Monday night and plan to resume Tuesday morning, GM spokesman Tom Wickham said. 

 Wickham would not say when talks were recessed or the time that they expected to resume on Tuesday. The UAW earlier on Monday called its first nationwide strike against GM in nearly 40 years, with some 73,000 active workers walking off their jobs at the automaker's plants.
