 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Southwest Airlines Co( LUV.N ), the leading U.S. low-cost carrier, said on Tuesday that it expects costs to rise faster than revenues in the third quarter because of expenses related to an employee buyout program. 

 Southwest expects costs for flying one seat a mile, or unit costs, to rise in a range of 4 percent to 5 percent, burdened by a $25 million pretax charge in the quarter from an employee buyout program, the company said in an investor update. The expected rise in costs is faster than the company's anticipated 2 percent increase in revenue per available seat mile, or unit revenues, implying weaker-than-expected quarterly earnings. "Southwest guidance suggests a third-quarter profit below both our own estimate and that of consensus," said JPMorgan analyst Jamie Baker in a note. He lowered his third-quarter earnings estimate to 20 cents per share from 23 cents. The voluntary program, which was accepted by 608 of the eligible 8,500 workers, is expected to yield annual cost savings of about $20 million through 2012, the company said. Southwest announced the buyout program in July. The offer, which includes a $25,000 cash bonus, is a way for the carrier to reduce expenses, which are rising as its industry-leading jet fuel hedges unwind. The company plans to replace the departed staff with entry-level workers. Southwest's statement comes on the heels of a disappointing revenue forecast from American Airlines parent AMR Corp AMR.N, which led to a sharp selloff in airline shares on Monday. Southwest shares fell 1.5 percent to $14.77 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by  Chris Reiter , editing by Gerald E. McCormick/Dave Zimmerman)
