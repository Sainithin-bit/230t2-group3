 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bear Stearns Cos Inc BSC.N said on Tuesday it snared three executives from rival companies to expand services to hedge fund clients. 

 Bear Stearns' reputation took a hit this summer when two of its hedge funds collapsed on wrong-way bets tied to risky subprime mortgages. The New York investment bank said Douglas Stern, a Morgan Stanley veteran, will help manage Bear's prime brokerage sales team, focusing on the firm's largest hedge fund customers. Joseph Aurilio and Ted Post, from UBS and Banc of America Securities, respectively, will concentrate on developing new business for Bear's prime brokerage operations.
