 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - The U.S. judge in a trade secrets case brought by Oracle Corp ORCL.O against arch rival SAP AG ( SAPG.DE ) on Tuesday called for speedy resolution of the dispute and encouraged the sides to consider mediation. 

 Judge Martin Jenkins of the U.S. District Court for Northern California said case filings left him unsure whether the case at hand was a minor business dispute that could be settled quickly or a major case of corporate malfeasance. Germany's SAP has admitted wrongdoing but argues that the dispute over contentious downloads of Oracle customer support materials by a U.S. subsidiary of SAP should be treated as a minor business licensing matter. Jenkins said Oracle's complaint against SAP, its bitter rival in the business software applications market, made the case look far more serious and "more like a securities case". "Those two (scenarios) don't necessarily fit," Jenkins told attorneys during a public hearing held to plan subsequent court dates. "It is a tale of two different stories." He ordered the case to go to trial February 9, 2009 -- more than half a year earlier than Oracle's proposed date of September 25. Silicon Valley-based Oracle had argued it needed 18 months to discover the scope of SAP's alleged wrongdoing, while SAP had urged a quick resolution. SAP, the world's biggest maker of business software, has admitted TomorrowNow carried out downloads of Oracle customer-support software that were "inappropriate". But it denies claims by Oracle, a database specialist that is closing the gap on SAP through an aggressive acquisitions strategy, that SAP itself amassed this downloaded material into an illegal library of Oracle software. TomorrowNow specializes in support for legacy PeopleSoft and JD Edwards software. SAP bought the company in 2005 to help it win over Oracle customers after PeopleSoft and JD Edwards were acquired by Oracle. Oracle is suing SAP for what it alleges to be "corporate theft on a grand scale". Jenkins said the record appeared to show some wrongdoing on SAP's part but that the case might amount to no more than defeminizing what the value of damages might be for licensing software code tied to a daylight savings time bug fix. "I do have concerns about the business tort-type claims that are alleged," the judge said in a case management hearing with attorneys from both sides. On the other hand, he allowed that SAP's actions through third-party companies to gain access to Oracle's software code may have involved a "nefarious agreement." "You folks sure you don't want this in front of the magistrate judge?" Jenkins asked, referring to a the possibility of shifting the case to a lower-level federal judge who handles lesser disputes, potentially speeding the outcome. "That can get you to the promised land quicker than I can given the docket I have," he said. (Additional reporting by  Eric Auchard  in San Francisco)
