 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Discover Financial Services, a credit card company spun off from Morgan Stanley at the end of June, said on Tuesday that third-quarter profit fell, hurt by rising marketing expenses. 

 The card issuer and network said profit for the quarter ended August 31 was $202.2 million, or 42 cents a share, compared with $241.4 million a year earlier. On a non-diluted basis, which is the only basis for which information is available for the third quarter of 2006, Discover earned 42 cents a share, compared with 51 cents in the same quarter last year. The company said it had $51.9 billion of loans either on its balance sheet or in securitization trusts at the end of the quarter, up 4 percent from last year. Discover also declared its first quarterly dividend of 6 cents per share. (Reporting by  Dan Wilchins , editing by Gerald E. McCormick/Dave Zimmerman)
