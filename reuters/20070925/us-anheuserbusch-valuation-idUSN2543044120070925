 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - While times of economic weakness usually sends jittery investors scrambling for safe havens, including brewery stocks, they have passed for now on ordering up the "King of Beers" -- leaving Anheuser-Busch Cos Inc's ( BUD.N ) shares flat. 

 Anheuser shares, just above a 5-year low, have gained 6 percent over the last year, underperforming competitors and leading some industry observers to expect some imminent management changes at the maker of Budweiser and Bud Light. Anheuser's performance compares to gains of 26 percent for Heineken NV ( HEIN.AS ), 37 percent for SABMiller PLC ( SAB.L ), 44 percent for Molson Coors Brewing Co ( TAP.N ) and 47 percent each for Carlsberg A/S ( CARLb.CO ) and InBev NV INTB.BR, the world's largest brewer by volume and maker of Stella Artois. The Standard & Poor's 500 index  .SPX  has gained 14 percent over the same period. "Generally speaking the beverage sector and the consumer staples ... have outperformed by a good margin," said Steve Dixon, manager of the Global Beverage Fund at Arnhold and S. Bleichroeder Advisors. "Anheuser has been losing share in the U.S. and Molson has been gaining share. Clearly, investors have shown a preference for Molson over Anheuser." In a research note from Monday, Bank of America's Bryan Spillane said he expected negative sentiment on the nation's No. 1 brewer to escalate in the coming weeks given recent market share weakness, investors' current love affair with soft drinks and Molson, and a still-bearish consensus. Spillane said soft drink makers like Coca-Cola Co ( KO.N ) and PepsiCo Inc ( PEP.N ), as well as their bottlers, were all trading at a premium to Anheuser. CHANGING TASTES Anheuser's problem, observers have said, stems from its reliance on the United States, where it controls nearly half the market. "They haven't had the emerging market exposure that the other brewers have had," said Harry Schuhmacher, editor and publisher of Beer Business Daily. "So huge a part of their earnings comes from the U.S., which has been a mature market since the early nineties. It's real hard to grow when you have 50-percent share of the most mature market in the world." Schuhmacher, as well as a Wall Street analyst who declined to be named, said he had heard talk in the industry about changes in management. The analyst said these changes could help the brewer as it evolves to meet consumers' demands. Anheuser, which did not immediately return calls seeking comment, has suffered as U.S. consumers choose wine, spirits, imported beers or small-batch "craft" beers. It has sought to capitalize on these trends through distribution deals with Grupo Modelo ( GMODELOC.MX ), InBev and Grolsch GROLc.AS, among others. Bank of America's Spillane, who has a "buy" rating on Anheuser shares, said he believes gains in the Anheuser's portfolio of imported and specialty beers will accelerate and the company will be able to increase its margins next year. Spillane said economic weakness should not impact beer sales, since sales data all the way back to 1868 shows little correlation to U.S. economic growth. "Data shows that people don't necessarily drink less to save money," Spillane wrote. "Nor does it show that they drink more to drown their sorrows." Anheuser shares closed at $50.43 on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday, up 45 cents, or nearly 1 percent higher. (See  here  for "Shop Talk" -- Reuters' retail and consumer blog)
