 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. administrative proceeding looking into the merger of organic grocers Wild Oats and Whole Foods Markets Inc. WFMI.O has not been stopped despite a loss in district court, but Federal Trade Commission Chairman Deborah Majoras said on Tuesday the FTC rarely presses on after losing a court fight. 

 The FTC had pressed hard to prevent Whole Foods from taking over Wild Oats, arguing that American consumers would be hurt because the two are the dominant organic, gourmet grocery chains. Asked about the case at a U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee hearing, Majoras said the agency's administrative process against Whole Foods had not been stopped but added: "It's been a very rare case when we've (pursued administrative action) when we've lost in district court." Last month, the FTC failed to win a temporary injunction in federal court to stop the merger while the agency's administrative examination of the deal unfolded. A federal appeals court upheld the decision on August 23, and the two companies merged within days. (Reporting by  Diane Bartz )
