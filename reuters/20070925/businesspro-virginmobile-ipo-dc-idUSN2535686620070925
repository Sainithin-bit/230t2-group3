 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Virgin Mobile USA Inc, a venture of 
Sprint Nextel Corp ( S.N ) and Virgin Group VA.UL, filed on 
Tuesday for an initial public offering of up to $467.5 million 
to raise money to repay debt and for general purposes. 

  The IPO would float 42.8 percent of Virgin Mobile and cut 
Sprint's stake in the wireless service provider to 17.2 percent 
from 47 percent. Virgin Group's ownership would drop to 35.7 
percent from 47 percent, according to a filing with U.S. 
regulators.  Virgin, which serves young people who pay for mobile phone 
calls in advance, competes with big national rivals as well as 
smaller niche providers. It said it expected to price 27.5 
million Class A common shares at $15 to $17 each.  The Warren, New Jersey-based company plans to sell about 
25.6 million shares, while stockholders will sell an additional 
1.95 million, according to an amended filing with the U.S. 
Securities and Exchange Commission.  Virgin Mobile will not receive proceeds for the stock sold 
by shareholders, it said.  The company had 4.83 million customers at the end of June, 
up from 4.57 million at the end of 2006.  Its competitors range from AT&T Inc ( T.N ), the top U.S. 
phone company, to small youth-focused services such as Sprint's 
Boost and Helio, a money-losing venture of SK Telecom 
( 017670.KS ) and EarthLink ( ELNK.O ).  Amp'd Mobile, another rival that served the youth market, 
went bankrupt earlier this year.  Virgin Mobile, which has been operating since July 2002 and 
runs its services on Sprint's network, also competes in the low 
end of the market with MetroPCS PCS.N, which raised $1.15 
billion in its initial public offering in April.  Virgin Mobile said it would use part of the proceeds of the 
IPO to repay $150 million of debt under its senior secured 
credit facility and $45 million that it owes to Sprint Nextel.  The company said it had turned a profit of $26.5 million on 
revenue of $666.9 million for the six months ended June 30. It 
posted a net loss of $36.7 million on revenue of $1.1 billion 
for 2006.  Virgin said it did not plan to pay dividends to its Class A 
shareholders and would instead keep earnings for operations and 
debt reduction.  The company said it had applied for a New York Stock 
Exchange listing under the symbol "VM."  (Reporting by  Sinead Carew  in New York and Sayantani Ghosh
