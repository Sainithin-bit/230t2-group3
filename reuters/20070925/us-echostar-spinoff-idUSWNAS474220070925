 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Satellite television operator EchoStar Communications Corp ( DISH.O ) said it may spin off its technology assets and announced plans to buy Sling Media, raising hopes that a split would increase the value of its businesses for shareholders or lead to a sale. 

 Shares in EchoStar, the second-largest U.S. satellite provider, rose as much as 9 percent on Tuesday after the company said it sought a tax-free way to turn its technology and wholesale satellite businesses into a new publicly-traded entity separate from its pay-TV DISH Network. Late on Monday, the company also said it agreed to buy privately held Sling Media. Sling's technology lets viewers pipe their favorite TV programs onto laptops and cell phones. Sling Media would be combined with EchoStar's spun-off assets if the plan were adopted, giving investors a direct way to trade on the business for set-top box technology, some analysts said. "We estimate spin-off would unlock $2 to $3 (per share) in value for DISH shareholders," Todd Mitchell analyst at Kaufman Bros wrote in a note to clients. "As a stand-alone pure-play we believe EchoStar's technology assets could receive a valuation in the $1 billion to $2 billion range." EchoStar's spin-off would include its set-top box design and manufacturing business, international operations and assets used to provide fixed satellite services to third parties. "It is likely that the potential spin-off/restructuring will trigger renewed speculation about possible M&A transactions," Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Craig Moffett said in a note to clients, though he questioned whether a spin-off would be necessary to selling either of EchoStar's businesses. EchoStar said it has asked the U.S. Internal Revenue Service whether it could carry out the spinoff on a tax-free basis to the company and shareholders. Under the plan, EchoStar's consumer pay-TV business would operate on its own as the DISH Network. Shareholders would have separate pro rata ownership interests in each company. "Each company would be able to separately pursue the strategies that best suit its respective long-term interests," said EchoStar Chairman and Chief Executive Charlie Ergen in a statement. Ergen would serve as chairman and CEO of both DISH Network and the spun-off company. ECHOSTAR BUYS SLING BOX EchoStar, which competes with rival satellite provider DirecTV Group Inc DTV.N and U.S. cable operators, will buy Sling Media in a deal that values Sling at $380 million. Sling Media is known for its Slingbox device that connects cable and satellite TV set-top boxes to the Internet, allowing a viewer to call up programs out of the home on mobile devices that have Web access. The Foster City, California, company's integration into the new technology services spin-off would make it easier to work with rivals to EchoStar's DISH. "Our business has always been operator agnostic. It was very important that model stays intact," Sling Media founder Blake Krikorian said in an interview. EchoStar had invested in an earlier round of financing for Sling Media. The purchase is expected to close in the fourth quarter. Kaufman's Mitchell estimates Sling Media has an annual revenue run-rate of roughly $50 million. EchoStar's pay-TV operations bring in around $11 billion a year. Analysts believe that EchoStar's Ergen is also eager to expand in the wholesale or fixed satellite services business, which has been favored by investors due to the growing bandwidth demand to carry high definition TV signals. "Ergen has made it clear over the last year that he is interested in pursuing business opportunities in the wholesale satellite services business," wrote Spencer Wang, analyst at Bear Stearns, in a note to clients. EchoStar was cited as a possible suitor for wholesale satellite operator Intelsat Ltd. earlier this year, before Intelsat agreed to be bought by UK-based private equity firm BC Partners in June. Shares in EchoStar were up 6.4 percent, or $2.63, to $43.95 in afternoon Nasdaq trading, after touching an intraday high of $45.00, its highest level since July.
