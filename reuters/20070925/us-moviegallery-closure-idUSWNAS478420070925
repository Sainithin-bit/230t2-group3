 (Reuters) - Movie Gallery Inc MOVI.O, the debt-plagued No. 2 U.S. movie rental company, said it plans to close about 520 underperforming and unprofitable Movie Gallery and Hollywood Video stores to save cash and reduce expenses. 

 It has retained Great American Group, a professional services firm, to assist it in conducting sales of the inventory at the closing stores, Movie Gallery said in a statement. Movie Gallery has been floundering under a total debt load of $1.1 billion since 2005 when it took over larger competitor Hollywood Video and in-store rental revenues began falling industrywide as a result of competition from online rentals.
