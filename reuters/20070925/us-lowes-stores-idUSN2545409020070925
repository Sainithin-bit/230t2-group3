 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Retailer Lowe's Cos Inc ( LOW.N ) said on Tuesday that it plans to open 135 to 145 stores in 2008. 

 The second-largest home improvement retailer behind Home Depot said during its analyst meeting that more than 80 percent of the stores would be in its larger format. Lowe's, which will open its first stores in Canada later this year and enter Mexico in 2009, said on Monday that full-year profit could trail its prior forecast, citing sales that were trending below expectations.
