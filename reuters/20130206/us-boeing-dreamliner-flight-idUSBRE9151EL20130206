 (Reuters) - Boeing Co ( BA.N ) will be allowed to conduct a one-time ferry flight of a grounded 787 Dreamliner from Texas to Washington, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said on Wednesday. 
 The FAA said the plane would have a minimal crew, which would have to continuously monitor the battery's status and land immediately if the flight computer displayed any battery-related messages. Regulators grounded the 787 on January 16 after a series of incidents with the plane's batteries. (Reporting By  Bill Rigby ; Editing by  Gary Hill )
