 (Reuters) - Leaders of the major BRICS emerging economies discussed the euro zone debt crisis on Thursday, Chinese Chairman Hu Jintao said. 
 Earlier Kremlin economic aide Arkady Dvorkovich said the BRICS -- Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa -- agreed to carry out regular consultations in International Monetary Fund and other forums. Hu said: "We have exchanged views on the global economic situation at the BRICS leaders meeting, we discussed the European debt crisis. Now we could exchange opinions on bilateral issues."
