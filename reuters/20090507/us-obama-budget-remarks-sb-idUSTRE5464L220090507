 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President Barack Obama said on Thursday the United States could not continue to spend as if deficits were irrelevant as he unveiled some $17 billion in savings to his $3.55 trillion budget for fiscal year 2010. 

 "We can no longer afford to spend as if deficits don't matter and waste is not our problem," Obama said. "We can no longer afford to leave the hard choices for the next budget, the next administration -- or the next generation." (Reporting by  Caren Bohan  and  Jeff Mason , Editing by Sandra Maler)
