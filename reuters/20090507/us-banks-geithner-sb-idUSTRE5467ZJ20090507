 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The importance of the stress tests on the top U.S. banks lies in its transparency, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said on Thursday. 

 Speaking to reporters about the government's stress test, Geithner said the exercise was a very credible, carefully designed test, but "we have a lot of work still in repairing the system." Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said in a statement the stress tests and the Treasury's capital program would help restore stability in the U.S. banking system. "These programs play a critical role in ensuring that the U.S. banking sector will be in a position of strength," Bernanke said.
