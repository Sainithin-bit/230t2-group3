 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Defying Congress for a fourth straight year, the Pentagon on Thursday submitted a budget proposal for fiscal 2010 that once again zeros out funding for an alternate engine for the F-35 fighter plane being developed by General Electric Co and Rolls-Royce Group Plc. 

 In each of the past three years, the Defense Department has pressed Congress to scrap the second engine for the F-35 fighter to save funds, but lawmakers have repeatedly added in funding to keep the alternate engine program alive. The F-35, or Joint Strike Fighter, is the newest family of advanced fighter planes being built by Lockheed Martin Corp for U.S. forces and eight partner countries. (Reporting by  Andrea Shalal-Esa )
