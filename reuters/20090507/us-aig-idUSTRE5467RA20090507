 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - American International Group ( AIG.N ), the insurer bailed out by the U.S. government, reported a $4.35 billion first-quarter loss on Thursday, its sixth consecutive quarterly loss. 

 The loss included $1.2 billion of costs related to AIG's wind-down of a controversial financial products unit, almost $1 billion of interest and costs related to a credit line from the Federal Reserve, and investment losses or writedowns of $1.6 billion. AIG's first-quarter loss was equal to about $1.98 per share, according to a company statement issued after U.S. markets closed on Thursday, compared with a loss of $3.09 per share in the same period a year ago. AIG reported a $61.7 billion loss in the fourth quarter, the largest quarterly loss in corporate history. On an adjusted basis, AIG posted a first-quarter loss of $1.6 billion, or 97 cents a share. The adjusted figure excludes net realized capital losses and FAS 133 losses. FAS 133 relates to accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities. The adjusted loss was less than a year ago when AIG, on the same basis, lost $3.56 billion, or $1.41 a share. AIG shares, which closed up 6 percent at $1.95 in the regular session on Thursday, were unchanged after the report. In the last year the shares have traded between 33 cents and $48.65, according to Reuters data. (Reporting by  Lilla Zuill ; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)
