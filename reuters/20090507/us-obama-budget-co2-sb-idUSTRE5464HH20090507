 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama's budget still plans for 100 percent of permits in a future greenhouse gas emissions trading system to be sold to industry, a spokesman for the White House Office of Management and Budget said on Thursday. 

 Obama has shown some flexibility on the cap-and-trade proposal since releasing his initial budget blueprint in February, but a spokesman said there were no changes. (Reporting by  Jeff Mason , Editing by Sandra Maler)
