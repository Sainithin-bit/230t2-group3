 (Reuters) - U.S. officials have laid out capital buffer targets and other conditions for the 19 largest U.S. banks that have been stress-tested against a hypothetical sharp downturn in the economy. 

 Results of the stress tests -- which will show how much capital some major institutions may be directed to raise -- are due to be released at 5 p.m. EDT (2100 GMT) on Thursday. The government's description of the test and requirements for capital recovery plans included: CAPITAL TARGETS: The stress test banks are being directed to achieve capital buffers that would allow them to have a Tier 1 risk-based ratio of at least 6 percent, and a Tier 1 common risk-based ratio of at least 4 percent at the end of 2010 under the more adverse economic scenario set out by the government. Banks normally are considered "adequately capitalized" if they have a Tier 1 risk-based ratio of at least 4 percent and are only expected to have common equity as the dominant element of that Tier 1 capital. Under the capital targets, they not only have to meet the higher standard of being "well-capitalized," but they have to hold a greater share of common equity. The emphasis on Tier 1 common capital reflects the view that common equity is critical to absorbing losses and to protect more senior stakeholders and creditors. TIME FRAME: Any tested bank needing to boost its capital buffer will have until June 8 to develop a detailed capital-raising plan and until November 9 to implement that plan. MANAGEMENT REVIEW: Banks needing to build their capital cushion must review existing management and board members to assure that the leadership of the firm has "sufficient expertise and ability to manage the risks in the current economic environment." The companies will have to prove that executives are able to keep banks' balance sheets sufficiently strong to continue "prudent lending to meet the credit needs of the economy." CAPITAL RECOVERY PLANS: Any bank required to boost capital will need to develop a detailed capital plan to be approved by its primary supervisor, in consultation with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Banks are encouraged to design capital plans that, wherever possible, actively seek to raise new capital from private sources. Plans should include actions such as issuing or restructuring capital instruments; selling business lines, assets or minority interests; and restricting dividends and stock repurchases. Banks must also outline plans to repay government capital injections and to wean themselves from FDIC-guaranteed debt. GOVERNMENT CAPITAL FACILITY: While private sources of capital are preferable, Treasury is offering support through its Capital Assistance Program, or CAP -- part of its $700 billion financial rescue fund -- as a "bridge to private capital." Banks can apply for "mandatory convertible preferred" securities under CAP in an amount up to 2 percent of risk-weighted assets, or higher upon request. The mandatory convertible preferred shares convert to common equity at the bank's or its regulator's choice, or within seven years. Banks can switch its existing government-held preferred stakes into the new convertible preferred securities, which will contribute even more to the quality of their capital buffers. Banks seeking to converting existing government stakes to mandatory convertible preferred securities must also convert private stakes into common equity or raise new private capital. TARP REPAYMENT: Any of the 19 stress test banks that want to repay government bailout funds must prove their overall soundness, capital adequacy, and the ability to lend. Banks must be able to maintain the heightened capital buffer determined by the stress test even after repaying government funds. They must also be able to issue enough senior unsecured debt without FDIC guarantees to show they can meet funding needs independent of government guarantees. OTHER DETAILS: The government said it has no plans to expand the stress test process beyond the 19 largest banks. Authorities said the capital demands will serve as a "one-time buffer" to give market participants and banks confidence that major banks will continue to provide credit, even if the economy takes a sharp turn for the worse. Once the heightened buffers are in place, regulators will use the normal supervisory process to determine banks' capital needs. The government reaffirmed its commitment "to stand firmly behind the banking system" to ensure banks continue to lend during this period of financial strain.
