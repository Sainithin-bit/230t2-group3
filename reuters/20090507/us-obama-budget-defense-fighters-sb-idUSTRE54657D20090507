 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Pentagon's fiscal 2010 budget plan seeks $6.8 billion in funding to buy 30 F-35 fighters built by Lockheed Martin Corp, plus $3.6 billion in research and development funding. 

 In budget documents released on Thursday, the Pentagon said it planned to buy 513 F-35s over the current five-year plan, and 2,443 overall. The budget, which must still be approved by Congress, also asked for $2.9 billion to buy 31 F/A-18 and E/A-18 fighters built by Boeing Co. (Reporting by  Andrea Shalal-Esa ; Editing by  Tim Dobbyn )
