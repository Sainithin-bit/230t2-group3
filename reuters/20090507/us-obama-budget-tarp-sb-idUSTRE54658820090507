 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - White House budget director Peter Orszag said on Thursday the Obama administration hoped it would not need to use a $250 billion "placeholder" for additional financial rescue efforts. 

 "We are retaining that placeholder, even though, again, that placeholder was out of an abundance of caution and it's very likely -- or it's our hope -- that it will not be necessary to call upon it," Orszag told reporters in a conference call. The White House earlier on Thursday gave new specifics for the $3.55 trillion budget plan for fiscal year 2010 that Obama outlined in February. The White House on Monday plans to release a further set of budget documents, and Orszag said it will include some adjustments to the budget forecast. In the February documents, the Obama administration estimated that the budget deficit would hit an all-time high of $1.75 trillion in the current 2009 fiscal year that ends in September. The White House expects the deficit to drop to a still-huge $1.17 trillion in 2010. Pressed on whether those figures would be adjusted in the Monday documents, Orszag said there would be "modest" changes to take account of some information that has come in since February such as capital gains tax receipts and other data.
