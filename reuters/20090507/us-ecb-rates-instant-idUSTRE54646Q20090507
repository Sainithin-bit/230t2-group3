 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Following are analysts' comments on remarks by European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet at a news conference on Thursday after the bank cut its key interest rate and announced unconventional steps to drive down borrowing costs and revive the euro zone economy. 

 ECONOMISTS' COMMENTS AURELIO MACCARIO, CHIEF EURO ECONOMIST, UNICREDIT GROUP "The single most important thing is the decision to start buying covered bonds starting from June. The initial extent of the program will be of around EUR 60bn -- not that much but a good starting point ... The ECB is almost squaring the circle by buying relatively safe/highly-rated paper and providing relief to the banking system that, in turn, should mean re-birth of these markets and more possibilities to extend medium-long term financing to the real economy. These measures will be completely sterilized, so, as Trichet pointed out, they can't be considered as QE, rather a step to revive some key euro area markets and an instrument to make deleveraging smoother." "These unconventional measures will be quickly unwound if things get better and in any case before any possible increase in the refi rate." "Well done, Mr. Trichet. Today's meeting constitutes a positive surprise that sends the clear message that in Frankfurt they are ready to do whatever is needed to get the system out of the woods. The decision on covered bonds means they play by the book of euro area idiosyncratic features and do not fear to be aggressive." "As a side note, Trichet made it official that Q1 growth was a disaster, that June staff forecasts will be sizably revised down and that risks remain broadly balanced, with the monetary analysis adding to the gloom. But now everybody should be aware that the ECB is ready to 1) lower rates a tad down if needed; 2) put more money on the table to avoid either deflation or a credit crunch." ANNA GRIMALDI, INTESA SANPAOLO "On the covered bonds we still don't have the details but 60 billion euros seems rather little, considering that BIS data I have seen shows there were 1.7 trillion euros in circulation at the end of 2007. "Still, hopefully it will have some effect in improving credit conditions. The other option they had was to buy syndicated loans from banks. "I think it may help German banks more than others because if I'm not mistaken their covered bonds tend to cover a wider range of assets whereas in other countries they are limited largely to the mortgage sector. "I think the overall message from the ECB is that they are still ready to do more on different fronts if conditions require." Earlier comments: JULIAN CALLOW, BARCLAYS CAPITAL "Crucially, concerning the purchase of covered bonds, Mr Trichet did not specify how this would be financed, i.e. by printing money or some form of sterilization. In his reply to a question on this, he would only say that the "technical details" would be addressed at the June Governing Council (GC) meeting. He later referred to the process as being aimed at helping the covered bond market to function better, rather than being taken as an attempt to boost nominal demand/the money supply (i.e. fully fledged QE), though clearly this "credit easing" could start to open the door for fully fledged QE from the summer, if the inflation outlook were to become more negative. "Note that the 60 billion size is fairly small: it represents 3% of the Eurosystem's current balance sheet, and 5% in more normal times (like end-2006), and 0.7% of our estimate for 2009 euro area nominal GDP. Note that the measure to purchase covered bonds (CB) seems intended to assist the functioning of these markets, with Mr Trichet noting that "Covered bonds have been particularly touched" by the market turmoil." JOHN HARDY CONSULTANT FX STRATEGIST AT SAXO BANK, "Considering the background of risk willingness in recent weeks, this was a relatively dovish performance from the (ECB). "But considering the expectations originating from the previous meeting, the ECB announcements were relatively in line. Most importantly, the euro has been a terrible laggard for a couple of weeks or more now and the reaction seems to be more about sell the rumor, buy the fact on QE than anything else." FRANCESCA PANELLI, ALETTI GESTIELLE "The decisions on interest rates and on extending the duration of lending facilities were both pretty much as expected. "On the covered bonds, 60 billion euros doesn't seem a very significant contribution, and there were probably more effective ways of boosting the economy. "Buying government bonds would probably be more effective, but that is obviously more problematic for the ECB than for the Bank of England. I think buying commercial paper would also probably be more effective."
