 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and other officials including Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke will brief reporters about the results of bank stress tests on Thursday afternoon ahead of their public release, the Treasury Department said. 

 Geithner and Bernanke, as well as Federal Deposit Insurance Corp Chairman Sheila Bair and Comptroller of the Currency John Dugan will speak to reporters 45 minutes ahead of a scheduled 5 p.m. (2100 GMT) release of stress-test results of 19 of the biggest U.S. banks. Information from the briefing will be embargoed until 5 p.m. About half of the big banks are expected to need more capital once the results of government tests of their ability to weather a deep recession are released.
