 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - White House budget director Peter Orszag said on Thursday the administration's budget would not make changes to President Barack Obama's climate change proposals. 

 Orszag made the remarks in a conference call to reporters. He was asked whether budget details to be released next week would include 100 percent auctioning of permits to industry in a future greenhouse gas emissions trading system. (Reporting by  Jeff Mason ; Editing by  Doina Chiacu )
