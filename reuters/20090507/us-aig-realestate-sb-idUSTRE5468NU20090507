 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - American International Group Inc ( AIG.N ) is in final talks with Nippon Life Insurance Co to sell its Japanese headquarters building, a source familiar with the matter said on Thursday. 

 The prized building in the Otemachi section of Tokyo could fetch a little more than $1 billion, the source said, adding that a deal had not yet been reached. AIG declined to comment. (Reporting by  Paritosh Bansal ) (For more M&A news and our DealZone blog, go to  www.reuters.com/deals )
