 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Pentagon said on Thursday it was seeking a $1.2 billion funding cut in missile defense spending for fiscal 2010 and set its budget request for the Missile Defense Agency at $7.8 billion. 

 The cut was lower than the $1.4 billion reduction initially announced by U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates. Pentagon documents said the program would be restructured to focus on rogue state and theater missile threats. The Pentagon said it would eliminate an increase in ground-based interceptors in Alaska but called for more research and development funding to improve defense against long-range rogue threats. The lion's share of the cuts, which need congressional approval, would come from general missile defense activities. That includes the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system built by Boeing Co, including interceptors that had been planned for Alaska. The Pentagon said it planned to cut funding in that area to $9.3 billion from $10.92 billion a year earlier. Funding for the Patriot PAC-3 missile program, a program involving Raytheon Co and Lockheed, was slated to drop sharply to $404.4 million from $1.04 billion a year earlier. Budget documents showed funding for the Aegis ballistic missile defense system built by Lockheed Martin Corp would increase to $1.86 billion in fiscal 2010, up from $1.17 billion in fiscal 2009. Funding for the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, also built by Lockheed, was slated to increase to $1.12 billion in the fiscal year beginning October 1 from $882 million last year.
