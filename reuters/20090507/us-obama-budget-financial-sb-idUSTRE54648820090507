 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The detailed version of President Barack Obama's budget unveiled on Thursday maintains a $250 billion "placeholder" for additional financial rescue efforts, should that money be needed, an administration official told Reuters. 

 "The TARP placeholder is still in the budget," said Ken Baer, press secretary for the White House Office of Management and Budget. "Nothing has changed with regards to the Financial Stabilization Plan." "It is there just in case that money may be needed," Baer said but he emphasized that no decision has been made about whether or when to formally request the money from Congress.
