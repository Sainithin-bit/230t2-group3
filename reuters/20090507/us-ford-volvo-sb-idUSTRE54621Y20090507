 STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - Ford-owned Volvo Car Corporation said on Thursday talks with the Swedish government on state guarantees for loans from the European Investment Bank (EIB) had been put on hold. 

 "After a long period of negotiations regarding guarantees for an EIB loan, Volvo Car Corporation and the Swedish government have jointly decided to postpone the discussions on the state guarantees," the company said in a statement. "This is due to the strategic review being carried out by Ford, which could lead to a sale of Volvo Car Corporation." In March, EIB granted Volvo Cars a loan of 200 million euros ($266 million) provided the carmaker could secure loan guarantees from Sweden. The loan would be used to develop new environmentally friendly vehicles. Last December, Sweden reserved 20 billion crowns ($2.5 billion) for such loan guarantees to aid Sweden's ailing auto industry. "We are of course very disappointed we have not reached an agreement," Volvo Cars chief executive Stephen Odell said in the statement, adding Sweden's decision would mean other European carmakers, which contrary to Volvo Cars have received government loan guarantees, now would have a competitive advantage. Volvo Cars said it would now focus on other government sponsored initiatives such as support for research and suppliers. ($1 = 0.7527 euro) ($1 = 7.949 Swedish crowns)
