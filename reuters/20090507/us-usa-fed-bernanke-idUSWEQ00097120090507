 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Lessons from government "stress tests" of the 19 largest U.S. banks could provide a guide to improvements in financial supervision and regulation, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Thursday. 

 Increasing the effectiveness of bank supervision is a "top priority" for the Fed, and paying more attention to problems that could shake the entire financial system will enhance stability in the future, Bernanke said in comments prepared for delivery to a conference organized by the Chicago Federal Reserve Bank. Bernanke, who spoke on the condition of the economy to Congress on Tuesday, did not address the outlook for the economy or monetary policy in his speech on Thursday.
