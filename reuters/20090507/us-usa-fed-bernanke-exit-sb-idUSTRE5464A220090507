 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Thursday that the U.S. central bank has the tools it needs to remove liquidity from the financial system in time to forestall any unwanted pickup in inflation. 

 "I do think we have the tools we need and we are certainly committed to removing liquidity from the system at the appropriate time to ensure that we will meet our price stability objective," Bernanke said in answering questions via satellite from Washington before a conference sponsored by the Chicago Federal Reserve Bank.
