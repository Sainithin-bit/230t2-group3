 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - General Electric Co's hefty finance arm is doing better than it had expected to under the Federal Reserve's base case for the U.S. economy and is an advantage for the company, Chief Executive Jeff Immelt said on Thursday. 

 "At this point we're better than the Fed base case, but it's all about where the trends go," Immelt said, adding: "We're all cautious, but it certainly seems a lot better." The company's GE Capital financing division has been the U.S. conglomerate's biggest weakness amid the current recession and was the main reason for GE's 22 percent drop in profit last year. But Immelt argued it helps GE move its products. "We get a chance to go out and drive technology and help our customers ... I think over the next couple months more and more people are going to see GE Capital as an advantage and not a disadvantage," he said. Immelt spoke to reporters in Washington ahead of a company event outlining a new healthcare push that includes plans to spend $2 billion to help doctors and others providers in poorer areas buy electronic health records. In March, GE told investors that profit at GE Capital could fall to a range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion if the economy performed as envisioned in the Fed's base-case scenario. That would be down from the $5 billion in earnings GE projected for the unit in December. Immelt said he was confident the company "used the right process to do the analysis" in measuring the financing unit to the Federal Reserve's economic assumptions. U.S. financial regulators are asking top banks to hold capital buffers significantly above normal regulatory standards to be considered well-capitalized.
