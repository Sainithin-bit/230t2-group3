 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President Obama proposed a 14 percent increase in the Food and Drug Administration's annual budget to more than $3 billion, budget documents released on Thursday said. 

 Obama's plan, which must be considered by Congress, also seeks industry fees to support reviews of generic versions of human drugs and reinspections of FDA-regulated facilities. (Reporting by  Lisa Richwine ; Editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
