 LONDON  (Reuters) - Sentiment among financial market clients is quite good at the moment but not enough to say further weakness can be ruled out, Thomson Reuters TRIL.L( TRI.TO ) Chief Executive Tom Glocer said on Thursday. 

 "I can't really call exactly where the bottom is. There can be false dawns. Right now, sentiment is quite good in the market. We see them opening up their purse strings just a little bit," Glocer said. Earlier, Thomson Reuters reaffirmed its full-year targets and reported that first-quarter revenues from ongoing businesses rose 3 percent before currency effects to $3.11 billion. Profit excluding special items was 40 cents per share, beating the average analyst forecast of 34 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. (Reporting by  Georgina Prodhan ; Editing by  Richard Hubbard )
