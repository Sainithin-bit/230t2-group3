 LONDON  (Reuters) - World stocks rose more than one percent on Thursday to their 2009 highs as investors bet on a stabilization of the world banking system, emerging markets and the global economy at large. 

 UK government bonds rallied while sterling fell across the board as the Bank of England increased the size of its quantitative easing program by 50 billion pounds ($75.79 billion) after leaving interest rates on hold at 0.5 percent as expected. The U.S. Treasury is due to release the results of "stress tests" of its major banks at 2100 GMT. Leaked reports show that about half will not need new capital and investors were encouraged by the clarity on how the others would cope with the most severe recession since World War Two. A surge in German manufacturing orders underlined an improving climate for the world economy. Banking stocks led a rally in stocks while oil hit a 2009 high above $58 a barrel. "What you have got in the market is increasing optimism. We have the bank stress tests results today which have seemed to have been leaked," said Bernard McAlinden, market strategist at NCB Stockbrokers. "It is not so much that it is good news, but the market wants to believe it is final news and it is a manageable thing." The MSCI main world equity index .MIWD00000PUS rose 1.3 percent to hit its highest since early November. The index, which has now risen more than 38 percent since its trough on March 9, is in positive territory for the year with a gain of 4.5 percent. European stocks  .FTEU3  rose 1.8 percent and were on course for a seventh consecutive daily rise. Banks were the top gainers, with Barclays ( BARC.L ) rising after reporting a 15 percent rise in its first quarter profit. Strong growth at Barclays' investment bank arm made up for a big jump in bad debts. U.S. stock futures were pointing to a firmer open on Wall Street, a day after stocks rallied following positive U.S. private sector employment numbers for April. June gilt futures rose 60 ticks after the BoE's decision while sterling fell to the day's low of 88.55 pence per euro. The euro rose 0.4 percent to $1.3357 after the European Central Bank cut interest rates as expected by 25 basis points to a record low of 1 percent. OUT OF CASH A key measure of market volatility and risk, the VIX .VIX "fear gauge" fell on Wednesday to its lowest level since September 22 -- shortly after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy protection and global markets seized up. Other gauges of risk appetite reinforced the more positive sentiment. European credit premia fell on Thursday, with the Markit iTraxx Crossover index of junk-rated credits down almost 18 basis points to 752. Emerging sovereign bonds too have benefited from the rise in risk appetite with yield spreads versus U.S. Treasuries narrowing to 471 basis points on JP Morgan's benchmark EMBI Plus index. This is a contraction of about 50 bps so far this month and more than 200 bps since the start of 2009. Emerging equities extended gains, rising 1.3 percent to fresh seven-month highs .MSCIEF. The index has risen over 27 percent since the start of the year. All of this is prompting long-term asset managers, who have shunned equities and risky assets for most of 2008, to get out of low-yielding cash. "People can't afford to sit on cash to generate returns," said Mark Hussein, head of private wealth management at UK-based wealth manager Kleinwort Benson. Elsewhere, the relatively high-yielding Australian dollar hit a 7-month high against the dollar. The low-yielding yen fell 0.9 percent to 99.32 per dollar. U.S. crude oil rose 2.7 percent to $57.87 a barrel for the first time since mid November, helped by expectations that economic improvement would boost oil demand. The June Bund future fell 76 ticks.
