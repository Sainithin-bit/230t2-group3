 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Fiat SpA ( FIA.MI ) Chief Executive Officer Sergio Marchionne plans to take the top spot at Chrysler LLC after the automaker emerges from bankruptcy, he told Bloomberg in an interview on Wednesday. 

 "Chrysler is on track to re-emerge from bankruptcy in 60 days," Marchionne said in the interview. "I will become Chrysler CEO after that." The idea has been discussed in meetings with the U.S. Treasury, he told Bloomberg.
