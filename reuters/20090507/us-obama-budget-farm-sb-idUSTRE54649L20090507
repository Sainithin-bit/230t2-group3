 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama on Thursday proposed a $250,000 a year cap on farm subsidies and a phase-out of the "direct payment" subsidy to large operators -- ideas already rejected this year by Congress. 

 "The president wants to maintain a strong safety net for farm families and beginning farmers while encouraging fiscal responsibility," said the White House in a detailed version of its budget proposal for fiscal 2010, which opens on Oct 1. Farm subsidy spending, estimated at $9.25 billion this year, would be cut by $1 billion a year under Obama's proposals, which include a reduction in crop insurance subsidies and an end to cotton storage payments.
