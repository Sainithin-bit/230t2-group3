 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Results of government stress tests of 19 top U.S. banks should allow markets to have greater confidence in the condition of the banks, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Thursday. 

 Responding to questions at a conference organized by the Chicago Federal Reserve Bank, Bernanke said he was pleased with the results of the stress tests and described the process as a fair and comprehensive effort. (Editing by  James Dalgleish )
