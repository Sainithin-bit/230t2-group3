GREECE: POLITICS: -- Euro zone finance ministers have agreed on a second bailout for debt-laden Greece that will resolve its immediate financing needs but seems unlikely to revive the nation's shattered economy. -- The rescue deal was clinched after Greece committed to fiscal cuts and reforms to make its economy more competitive, and by agreeing that private bondholders in a bond swap would have to take larger losses. -- Greece formally launched its swap offer to private bond holders on February 24, setting in motion the largest-ever sovereign debt restructuring to help it repair its messy finances. The swap is part of the second 130 billion euro bailout package. -- The swap, in which investors will trade bonds for lower-value debt securities, aims to slice 100 billion euros off Greece's over 350 billion euro debt load. -- Greece has set a March 8, deadline for investors to participate in the so-called private sector involvement (PSI). It wants to conclude the transaction before March 20, when 14.5 billion euros of debt repayments fall due. GOVERNMENT DEBT SUPPLY: -- Athens is expected to continue monthly auctions of three- and six-month T-bills in March as it needs to refinance a total of 3.05 billion euros of maturing paper. Monthly T-bill sales are Greece's sole source of market funding. -- March 6 - Auction of 6-month T-bills -- March 20 -Auction of 3-month T-bills DATA: March 5 - November construction data March 8 - Unemployment (monthly) for December March 9 - February consumer inflation data ITALY: -- Italy's government is negotiating labor market reforms with unions as the next step in a strategy aimed at stimulating chronically weak growth and shoring up public finances. -- Official data shows the economy has been in recession since the middle of last year and shrank 0.7 percent in the fourth quarter. Output this year is expected to contract by around 1.5 percent, according to the central bank. -- Prime Minister Mario Monti says he wants to reform a system that offers too much protection to salaried employees in medium-sized and large companies, while offering virtually no rights or protection to growing legions of mostly young people on temporary contracts. -- Monti has said the package will be presented by end-March at the latest. -- In January, the government presented plans to abolish minimum fees for professional services, increase the number of pharmacies and change the rules governing several other services with the aim of boosting competition. The Senate votes on the package on March 1. It will then move to the Chamber of Deputies and is due to be definitively approved by mid-March. -- The service sector reforms follow an austerity program already approved by parliament aimed at balancing the budget in 2013. This was made up largely of tax hikes, but also included pension reform and spending cuts. -- A number of relatively successful bond auctions, and measures at the EU level to help Greece avoid default, have brought Italy's 10-year bond yields down to under 5 percent from peaks close to 8 percent near the end of last year. POLITICS: -- Ongoing negotiations between government and unions over reform of labor market rules. -- Ongoing negotiations between government, political parties and professional lobbies over the deregulation package which is being debated and amended in parliament.
