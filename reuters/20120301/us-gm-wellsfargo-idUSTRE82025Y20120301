 (Reuters) - General Motors Co ( GM.N ) named Wells Fargo & Co ( WFC.N ) as its auto financing partner for Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac dealers and retail customers in the contiguous states. 
 Alongside retail subvention, Wells Fargo will offer GM dealers non-subvented retail loans, and financing solutions like wholesale floor plan, and treasury services and insurance, the companies said in a joint statement. Earlier on Thursday, a surprising sales gain by General Motors and strong performances by Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) and others helped push U.S. February auto sales to their highest annual sales rate in nearly four years. General Motors shares were up 2 percent at $26.80 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Wells Fargo shares rose as much as 1 percent at $31.75. (Reporting by  Bijoy Koyitty  in Bangalore)
