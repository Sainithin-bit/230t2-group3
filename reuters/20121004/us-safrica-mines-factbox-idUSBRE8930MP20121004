 (Reuters) - Nearly two months of labor unrest that started in South Africa's platinum mines have spread across the sector and appear to be spilling into other parts of the economy such as manufacturing. 
 Here is a summary of the worst-hit companies: ANGLO AMERICAN PLATINUM (AMPLATS) Amplats' four Rustenburg mines have been shut since September 12 when the world's largest platinum producer closed its doors to protect employees from escalating violence by wildcat strikers. Fewer than 20 percent of the company's 21,000 employees have been reporting for work since then, despite threats of the sack. ANGLOGOLD ASHANTI The bullion producer's Kopanang mine, southwest of Johannesburg, reported a stay-away on September 21. Five days later it said all its South African operations were at a standstill. The company warned that the prolonged strike by 24,000 miners could lead to the closure of less-profitable shafts. GOLD FIELDS Two mines run by the world's fourth largest bullion producer have been halted by illegal strikes. Starting at its KDC operations near Carletonville west of Johannesburg on September 10, the protests bubbled over to its Beatrix mine in the Free State province two weeks later. The two operations employ 24,000 miners. OTHER MINES/COMPANIES Labour strife has also hit the following companies: - An illegal strike has halted production at Toyota Motor Corp's factory in Durban since October 1. - A scheduled truckers' strike now in its second week is disrupting fuel supplies to petrol stations and hitting freight and logistics firms. - Harmony Gold's Kusasalethu mine near Carletonville (started October 3) - Kumba Iron Ore's Sishen mine in the Northern Cape province (started October 3) - Gold One's Ezulwini Mining Company (started October 2) - Petra Diamonds' Kimberley Underground operations in the Northern Cape (started October 2) - Atlatsa Resources Corporation's joint venture with Amplats at Bokoni Platinum Mine in Limpopo province (started October 1) - Samancor West Chrome Mines near Rustenburg (started with a sit-in on September 28) - Village Main Reef's Blyvooruitzicht mine near Carletonville (started September 28) (Compiled by Sherilee Lakmidas and Ed Stoddard; Editing by  Ed Cropley )
