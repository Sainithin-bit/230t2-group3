 MADRID  (Reuters) - Spain's central bank governor Luis Maria Linde said on Thursday that any possible rescue package for Spain would likely not imply big additional spending adjustments for the government. 
 Speaking in a parliamentary hearing he also said that an increase in pension payments in line with inflation would pose a problem for the country meeting its public deficit targets this year. (Reporting by Carlos Ruano; Writing by Nigel Davies)
