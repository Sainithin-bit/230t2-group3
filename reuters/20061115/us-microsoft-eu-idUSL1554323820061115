 LONDON  (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp has until Thursday next week to provide rival firms with outstanding details of its software systems or face fresh fines, the EU's antitrust chief said, according to the Guardian newspaper. 

 Neelie Kroes gave the U.S. software giant until Thanksgiving Day in the United States to reveal the relevant information about its Windows operating system, the newspaper reported. Microsoft could face a fine of up to 3 million euros ($3.85 million) a day it if failed to comply, it added. Kroes told the Guardian that she was growing tired of waiting for Microsoft to meet her demands. "I don't have eternal life," she said in an interview. "I am not impressed if someone says 90 percent of the information is already there when we need 100 percent. It's a jigsaw and some parts are missing ... In my opinion, this information should have been here a couple of months ago." Microsoft has had a long-running legal battle with Brussels over its software and last month promised the European Union's Executive Commission it would alter its new Vista operating system to enable rival firms to develop ancillary software. In 2004, the Commission found Microsoft had abused its market dominance in audiovisual software players and office servers. It forced the U.S. firm to strip out Windows Media Player from its ubiquitous operating system. The Commission levied a record 497 million euro fine. In July, EU regulators fined the company a further 280.5 million euros for defying the ruling, which required it to share information on its servers with rivals.
