 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Clear Channel Communications Inc. ( CCU.N ), the No. 1 U.S. radio company, was evaluating two takeover offers at a board meeting on Wednesday, sources familiar with the situation said. 

 Two teams of private equity firms submitted offers, sources have previously told Reuters. The value of the bids was not immediately available. Clear Channel, which has 1,150 stations, has a market capitalization of about $16.8 billion. The deliberations by Clear Channel's board stretched into Wednesday afternoon and the timing of a decision was unclear, sources said. A decision could be made on Wednesday or Thursday, but may be delayed if the company seeks additional information from the bidders or asks for a new round of offers, one source said. The company also could reject the bids outright, the source said. One bidding group consisted of Providence Equity Partners, The Blackstone Group BG.UL and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts KKR.UL, while the second team included Bain Capital and Thomas H. Lee Partners THL.UL, sources previously said. The private equity firms and Clear Channel declined to comment. The New York Times reported on Wednesday that the teams had submitted separate offers worth more than $36 a share, and had planned to submit revised bids ahead of Clear Channel's board meeting on Wednesday. Shares of Clear Channel closed at $34.12, up 1 cent, on the New York Stock Exchange. The New York Times said a winning offer would likely end up below $37 a share, which was below some analysts' expectations that reached as high as $40 a share. "I don't think a deal will happen at $36. I don't think shareholders will approve it. I think the price is too low. A price of $38 to $42 per share is a fair value," said Kit Spring, an analyst with Stifel, Nicolaus & Co. "I think investors may be displeased at how quickly the bidding process has gone. I think a higher price can be achieved if some of the assets were sold piecemeal before a private equity buyout was considered," Spring said. Clear Channel, based in San Antonio, Texas, said last month it was evaluating strategic alternatives and had hired investment bank Goldman Sachs & Co. ( GS.N ) to advise it.
