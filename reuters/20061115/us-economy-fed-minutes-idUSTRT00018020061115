 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. Federal Reserve officials worried last month that inflation might not recede as hoped and an inflationary psychology could set in, making their job tougher, according to meeting minutes released on Wednesday. 

 "All members agreed that the risks to achieving the anticipated reduction in inflation remained of greatest concern," minutes of the Fed's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee October 24-25 meeting said. "Members noted that a significant amount of data would be published before the next committee meeting in December, giving the committee ample scope to refine its assessment of the economic outlook before judging whether any additional firming was needed to address those risks," the minutes said. Fed participants expressed concern that inflation expectations could drift upward if core inflation -- as measured when volatile fuel and energy costs are stripped out -- remain elevated for a protracted period. The Fed in October kept its benchmark overnight federal funds rate steady at 5.25 percent for the third meeting in a row, predicting that moderating economic growth would likely ease consumer price pressures. MESSAGE "HAWKISH" The minutes conveyed Fed concerns about the outlook for inflation, but expectations that core inflation would edge lower as economic growth slows, although it noted that there were dangers that price rises could fail to ease. "All participants emphasized that the risks around the desired downward path to inflation remained to the upside," the minutes said. Prospects for Federal Reserve interest rate policy to remain on hold for several more months were solidified by Wednesday's minutes. Futures prices show the Fed will hold policy steady through January as chances of a cut in the federal funds rate in March FFJ7 to 5 percent from the current 5.25 percent were last at 14 percent, down from as high as 40 percent on Tuesday. After the minutes release, U.S. Treasury debt prices extended losses while Wall Street stock prices pared gains but stayed in positive territory, and the dollar edged higher. "The main message was a little bit of a hawkish one. They wanted to remind that they still have a bias toward raising rates if inflation remains as high as it has been over the past 12 months," said John Miller, head of fund management at Nuveen Investments in Chicago. Fed officials were confident that the economy would expand at a rate close to or a little below its long-run potential and that any drag the slowdown in housing activity would have would gradually wane. The slowdown in the housing market and declines in house price gains was not translating to a slowdown in consumer spending to date, the Fed said. "Many participants drew some comfort from the most recent data, which suggested that the correction in the housing market was likely to be no more severe than they had previously expected and that the risk of an even larger contraction in this sector had ebbed," the minutes said. TIGHT LABOR MARKET But many participants expressed concerns that any significant home price declines could have a more pronounced impact on consumer and other spending. While the labor market remained tight, it was unclear from data whether wages were rising as a result, the minutes said. But members saw high profit margins as providing some scope for businesses to absorb increased labor costs without passing them on to consumers in the form of higher prices. Policy-makers also discussed the merits of inflation targeting at their meeting but felt the issue merited more deliberation, the minutes showed. "The possible specification of a numerical price objective raised a number of complex and interrelated issues that required considerable further discussion," the minutes said. Participants agreed to continue their review of communication issues at the FOMC's January meeting. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke believes adopting an explicit target would help the U.S. central bank anchor inflation expectations. But some other Fed policymakers have voiced concern that it might also deny them important policy flexibility. Democrats, who retook control of Congress in November 7 elections for the first time in 12 years, have also expressed worry that any target may be bad news for job growth. Congress has given the Fed a dual mandate to seek both price stability and full employment.
