 VANCOUVER, British Columbia  (Reuters) - Alcan Inc. AL.TO hit back on Wednesday at a report naming it as the company in Canada with the biggest pension shortfall and said the analysis did not take into account that it was not required to set aside retirement monies at its European operations. 

 In a report released on Tuesday ratings agency Moody's Investors Services said Alcan's pension plan was underfunded to the tune of C$3.1 billion ($2.7 billion) at the end of 2005, putting it at the top of a list of Canadian companies that had Nortel Networks NT.TO in the No. 2 position and Bombardier Inc. ( BBDb.TO ) in third. Rhodri Harries, vice president and treasurer at Alcan, said about US$1 billion of the US$2.7 billion figure related to Alcan's businesses in Europe, where pension plans were generally run on a "pay as you go" basis and "unfunded by design." "There is no regulatory requirement to fund them and no tax benefits," Harries told Reuters. He said the remaining sum of around US$1.7 billion did need to be funded, but the size of the liability was unsurprising given that Alcan is one of Canada's biggest companies and hence would have a very large pension plan. Alcan is the world's second largest-producer of primary aluminum. "We are in a very good position to service those liabilities through the combination of the assets that we have put aside, through the strength of our business and through the strength of our balance sheet," Harries said. Moody's said that an underfunded pension plan would not generally cause a change in a company's credit rating on its own, but it could "contribute materially" to the overall rating assessment. It said telecom equipment giant Nortel's pension plan was underfunded to the tune of C$2.9 billion at the end of 2005 and Bombardier's was underfunded by C$2.6 billion. A Nortel spokesman said he was aware of the report but that the company had no comment at this time. Bombardier could not immediately be reached for comment. ($1 = $1.14 Canadian)
