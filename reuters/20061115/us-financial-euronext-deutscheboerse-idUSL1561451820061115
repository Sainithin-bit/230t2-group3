 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Deutsche Boerse ( DB1Gn.DE ) dropped its bid for Euronext ENXT.PA and said on Wednesday a deal that would have been supported by both sides was no longer feasible, clearing the way for a rival bid from the New York Stock Exchange operator NYSE Group Inc. NYX.N. 

 The management of Euronext, which runs the Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels and Lisbon stock exchanges, has repeatedly rebuffed Deutsche Boerse in preference for a merger with NYSE Group. Confirming a Reuters report on Tuesday, Deutsche Boerse said in a brief statement it would "stop all preparatory steps including the regulatory and merger control processes". "Politicians, stakeholders and regulators across Europe have confirmed their preference for a European solution," it said. "Despite this broad support, the Euronext management did not reopen talks with Deutsche Boerse. However, Deutsche Boerse continues to believe that a combination of exchanges can only be successful if both sides willingly work together," it added. Deutsche Boerse's withdrawal from the bid battle derails plans for a pan-European securities trading group, which have been cherished by many in continental Europe's financial industry as well as monetary policy makers and politicians. Euronext had no immediate comment. The news came just hours after a group of seven leading investment banks said they planned to create a new pan-European equity trading platform next year to compete with Europe's stock exchanges and reduce the cost of buying and selling shares. Analysts said Deutsche Boerse's failure to win over Euronext and the new threat from the banks' planned trading platform meant the German group was now being squeezed from all sides. "Deutsche Boerse is losing on two fronts," said LRP analyst Olaf Kayser. "This will increase consolidation pressure on the sector. But Deutsche Boerse is now isolated." Deutsche Boerse Chief Executive Reto Francioni played down the banks' move, telling a news conference in Frankfurt he did not believe the project was aimed specifically against it. "I don't think it is aimed specifically against Deutsche Boerse ... but against stock exchanges in general," Francioni said. "I believe it is a serious effort." Both the Deutsche Boerse and NYSE bids for Euronext were a combination of stock and cash, meaning that the value of each fluctuated with the prices of shares in Deutsche Boerse and NYSE, respectively. When Euronext's management agreed in early June to join forces with NYSE, the U.S. bid was worth around $10 billion. NYSE shares have risen almost 50 percent since then, while Deutsche Boerse's are up by around 25 percent. Some analysts valued the German bid currently at 7 euros ($8.98) below NYSE's offer per Euronext share. Francioni rejected an offer from NYSE and Euronext to join their planned tie-up, but added that Deutsche Boerse remained open to another deal with Euronext. "The door is not closed if they approach us," he said. Deutsche Boerse shares were down 1.9 percent at 0913 GMT, paring some losses after the announcement, while Euronext shares extended losses to trade down 4.6 percent.
