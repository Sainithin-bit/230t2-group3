 NEW ORLEANS  (Reuters) - A New Orleans jury swiftly handed Merck & Co. Inc. ( MRK.N ) a victory on Wednesday in a federal lawsuit over its withdrawn arthritis drug Vioxx, deliberating for about 90 minutes before finding the company adequately warned of the risks associated with the drug. 

 In one of thousands of Vioxx lawsuits it faces, Merck successfully defended itself against claims that it hid the Vioxx heart risks and that the pain medicine was responsible for a 2003 heart attack suffered by plaintiff Charles Mason. "Obviously we're disappointed," said Mason's attorney, Ed Blizzard. "We thought the evidence showed that Merck failed to warn Mr. Mason's family practitioner about the risks. Obviously the jury disagreed with us." Had the jury found Merck failed to adequately warn of the Vioxx health risks, it would have been asked to determine if the drug was the primary cause of the heart attack and to determine monetary damages. Mason, 61, who took Vioxx for 10 months to treat back pain from an old injury, blamed the drug for his 2003 heart attack. Trial testimony included that he had stopped taking Vioxx a few days before the attack. Attorneys for Merck argued that the company had followed all government guidelines in reporting health risks associated with the medicine, and that Mason's heart attack was caused by other health risk factors and not by Vioxx. "We thought the evidence showed clearly that first, Mr. Mason had not taken Vioxx for several days before his heart attack, and second, that there was no (blood) clot that could have come from Vioxx," said Merck attorney Phil Beck. Evidence presented by doctors during the trial showed that a medical procedure performed on Mason did not find a blood clot that might have been caused by Vioxx and led to a heart attack. Merck pulled the drug from the market in September 2004 after a study showed it doubled the risk of heart attack and stroke in patients taking it for at least 18 months. At last count, the New Jersey-based drugmaker was facing nearly 24,000 lawsuits from people who claim to have been harmed by the drug that once had $2.5 billion a year in sales. Merck has steadfastly insisted it will try each case on an individual basis rather that discuss a comprehensive settlement agreement with plaintiffs. "This is a satisfying verdict for Merck," Merck General Counsel Kenneth Frazier said in a statement. "Juries across the country in both state and federal courts have determined that the company acted responsibly in properly disclosing data to the medical community." Of 11 Vioxx lawsuits that have gone to a jury verdict, Merck has now won seven. However, a New Jersey state court judge ordered one of the victories to be retried after ruling that some new evidence had come to light. David Logan, dean of the Roger Williams University School of Law in Rhode Island, said he believes Merck will let several more trials play out before deciding whether to continue litigating or enter into a broad settlement with plaintiffs. A state court Vioxx trial with two plaintiffs is currently underway in California. The next federal Vioxx trial, all of which are being overseen by U.S. District Court Judge Eldon Fallon of the Eastern District of Louisiana, is set to begin on November 27.
