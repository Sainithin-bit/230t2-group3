 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Tyco International Ltd. reported higher-than-expected quarterly earnings on Wednesday on strong demand in its fire and security and electronics segments and lower taxes, and the conglomerate launched a $600 million restructuring program. 

 Tyco, whose products range from fiber optic technology and home security systems to surgical products, also said its planned break-up into three companies was on track, with two companies keeping the Tyco name. In addition, the company said it will restate past years' results after an investigation into stock options. Shares rose 64 cents, or 2 percent, to $30.54 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The company said net income rose 38 percent to $1.27 billion, or 62 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended on September 29, from $917 million, or 44 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding special items and discontinued operations, profit was 51 cents per share, two cents a share ahead of analysts' average forecast, according to Reuters Estimates. "In terms of the bottom line, it's a good quarter," said Brian Loftus, an analyst with Maple Asset Management, which owns Tyco shares. "Fire and security had a great quarter." Revenue rose 8 percent to $10.76 billion, compared with Wall Street forecasts of $10.55 billion. Three of Tyco's four divisions posted double-digit percentage sales gains, and all four reported double-digit increases in operating profit. GETTING HEALTH CARE 'ON TRACK' "We've got good trends and it can get so much better if health care can get back on track," Loftus said, adding that health care contributes more than a third of company profits, but posted lower profit margins compared with recent quarters. The division, which is recovering from product recalls earlier in the year, reported 3 percent sales growth in the quarter. "While health care organic growth was disappointing in the quarter, we believe it was overshadowed by the strong organic growth in the company's other businesses," Goldman Sachs analyst Jack Kelly said in a research note. Separately, Tyco said it expects to file documents with regulators in mid-January 2007 detailing its break-up plan. Tyco has essentially completed picking management teams and boards for the companies, Chief Executive Ed Breen said, and will hold an investor day after filing separation documents with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Tyco Electronics will retain its name, while Tyco International will encompass the company's fire and security and engineered products businesses, Breen said. The company is working on a new name for its health care division. The company also said it expected up to $600 million in restructuring charges, mostly in the current fiscal year. The fire and security segment will incur the most costs. The program will include some job cuts, and the closure of offices and plants, and will lead to cash savings of $50 million in fiscal 2007, $200 million in 2008 and $300 million annually by 2009, Tyco said. The company also said it expected first-quarter earnings of 42 to 44 cents per share from continuing operations, before special items. Analysts were expecting 45 cents. Tyco said an internal review of stock option practices has found several errors, and will restate results for several years prior to 2006. The company's stock option accounting had errors resulting from incomplete documentation of grants made between 1999 and 2002, when the company was headed by former CEO Dennis Kozlowski, who is serving a prison sentence after being convicted of defrauding Tyco. The company also found unintentional misapplication of accounting principles and inadequate controls, and an error related to compensation expenses. These errors resulted in an aggregate compensation expense of $281 million, or $191 million after taxes.
