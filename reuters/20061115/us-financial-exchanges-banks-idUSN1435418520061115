 LONDON  (Reuters) - A group of seven leading investment banks said on Wednesday they planned to create a new pan-European equity trading platform next year in a move that will compete with Europe's stock exchanges. 

 Citigroup ( C.N ), Credit Suisse ( CSGN.VX ), Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ), Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ), Merrill Lynch MER.N, Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) and UBS ( UBSN.VX ) said in a statement they will form a new company with an independent management team to develop the platform. The announcement confirmed what a source familiar with the matter had told Reuters late on Tuesday. The plan comes as stock exchanges, such as the London Stock Exchange ( LSE.L ), Euronext ENXT.PA and Deutsche Boerse ( DB1Gn.DE ), have seen their share prices rise amid expectations of consolidation. Deutsche Boerse, however, was seriously considering dropping a bid it has made for Euronext, sources close to the Frankfurt stock exchange operator have told Reuters. The management of Euronext, which runs the Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels and Lisbon stock exchanges, is committed to a merger with U.S. NYSE Group Inc NYX.N. NEW EUROPEAN RULES The seven investment banks -- which account for almost half of the exchange trading in European equities as well as being dominant players in off-exchange trading -- said their rival platform would take advantage of new European rules that come into force next November. The European Union's Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) hopes to create a pan-European market in financial services that will ensure customers get value for money and greater transparency. "We are responding to the MiFID legislation by creating an integrated pan-European trading platform where equities can be traded more cost effectively, obtaining significant liquidity with greater efficiency for each and every participant in the equity markets," a spokesman for the banks said. The banks will be shareholders in the new entity and have committed to financing it. The spokesman declined to say how much money each planned to inject, but said they had also committed people and resources. The intention was to attract liquidity from across Europe, the banks' statement said. The platform aimed to "reduce the costs of buying and selling shares and promote greater transparency of equity prices and volumes," the statement said. The spokesman said the new company was tentatively being called Project European MTF (Multilateral Trading Facility) until a full-time name was agreed upon. A memorandum of understanding was signed on the plan in the last week, he added.
