 LONDON  (Reuters) - British supermarket operator J. Sainsbury Plc ( SBRY.L ) said its recovery was on track as it reported a 60 percent surge in underlying first-half pretax profit to 189 million pounds ($359 million). 

 Halfway through a three-year turnaround plan, results on Wednesday from Britain's third-largest grocer by market share kept the group on track to meet its target of 2.5 billion pounds of total of extra sales by 2008. Chief Executive Justin King said price cuts and Sainsbury's focus on fresh and healthy food -- the subject of an advertising campaign fronted by celebrity chef Jamie Oliver -- had returned it to favor with customers. "We have made good progress during the first six months of the year, reporting our seventh consecutive quarter of like-for-like sales growth, our best performance for many years," King said at a press conference. Sainsbury, which struggled in recent years to keep up with market leader Tesco Plc ( TSCO.L ) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc's ( WMT.N ) Asda, said it had raised its interim dividend 11.6 percent to 2.4 pence per share. Remarking on the start of the Christmas shopping period, King said price competition had remained "as vigorous in recent weeks and months as it has ever been". He cautioned the second half would be "a steep curve" due to tough comparables last year, when Sainsbury's notched up 5 percent growth in the last quarter, but reiterated his aim to achieve average growth of 3.0 to 3.5 percent during the three year plan. Sainsbury, with nearly 16 percent share of Britain's grocery market, or around half that of Tesco, also reported break-even at an operating level at Sainsbury's Bank. Reported pretax profit for the six months ended October 7, including one-off items, reached 194 million pounds, just beating an average forecast of 192 million in a Reuters poll. Total sales rose 8.3 percent to 9.6 billion pounds. BID SPECULATION Sainsbury's shares were the highest gainers on the DJ Stoxx index of European retailers .SXRP in the past five days, on high expectations from the results and speculation the one-time bid target could again be in private equity's sights. The stock traded down 0.8 percent at 409-1/4 pence by 0930 GMT, on what analysts said was profit taking. "The shares look very expensive on earnings multiples but we think that a bidder prepared to sell on the property could pay 500 pence a share," Numis analysts said in a note. Sainsbury shares trade at 30 times full-year 2006 earnings, well above the DJ Stoxx European retailers .SXRP average of 18 times, Reuters data showed. King declined to comment on the private equity speculation, centered on core shareholder Lord David Sainsbury's resignation from the UK government last week. The move triggered the release of his family's 16 percent stake from the "blind trust" they have been locked in since Sainsbury entered government eight years ago. "We never comment on market rumor and speculation other than to say we are aware of our obligations to report and we have nothing to report," King said. He said he also did not expect to have a conversation with Sainsbury, a member of the supermarket's founding family, until "some time after" the shares are fully released from the trust in three months' time.
