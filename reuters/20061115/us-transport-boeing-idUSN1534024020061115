 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Aerospace company Boeing Co ( BA.N ) is poised to receive more than $10 billion worth of additional business in the coming weeks, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday, as airlines move to update aging long-haul fleets. 

 General Electric Co's ( GE.N ) Commercial Aviation Services leasing and finance unit is expected to order 15 Boeing 777s in a deal valued at $3.5 billion at list prices, the Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Boeing also has tentative deals with carriers in Europe and Asia for an additional 50 wide-body jets that could be announced before the end of the year, the paper said. If this occurs, the company could approach the record year it had in 2005, with 1,028 net orders. Wide-body planes carry list prices of roughly $150 million to as high as about $280 million. Boeing has benefited from the uncertainty created by internal turmoil and production problems at rival Airbus, a unit of EADS ( EAD.PA ).
