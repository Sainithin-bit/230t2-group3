 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shuffling its investments in consumer-oriented stocks, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. ( BRKa.N ) ( BRKb.N ) on Tuesday said it raised its holdings in Lowe's Cos. ( LOW.N ) and Nike Inc. ( NKE.N ), but may have reduced its stakes in Anheuser-Busch Cos. ( BUD.N ) and Target Co. ( TGT.N ). 

 In a regulatory filing, Berkshire said it owned 7 million shares of Lowe's, the home improvement retailer, on September 30, up from 390,000 on June 30. It also said it owned 4 million shares of footwear specialist Nike, up from 2.47 million. Berkshire also reported a 36.42 million share stake in Budweiser brewer Anheuser-Busch, down from 43.53 million in June. It also reported a 745,700 share Target stake, compared with 5.5 million shares in June. Regulators sometimes let Berkshire delay disclosing some of its buying and selling so investors cannot copy it, and have done so in the past with respect to the Target stake. Berkshire reported owning $49.66 billion of stock as of September 30. Among other changes in the third quarter, Berkshire said it cut its stake in tax preparer H&R Block Inc. ( HRB.N ) to 10.97 million shares from 11.39 million, and raised its stake in records management company Iron Mountain Inc. ( IRM.N ) to 6.03 million shares from 5.02 million. It also confirmed it has more than doubled its stake in building products company USG Corp. ( USG.N ), to 16.7 million shares from 6.5 million. In addition, Berkshire reported a 10 million share stake in Western Union Co. ( WU.N ), which was recently spun off from another Berkshire holding, First Data Corp. FDC.N. Buffett, the world's second-richest person behind Microsoft's Bill Gates, generally favors investing in companies with stable, easy-to-understand businesses that are industry leaders, and whose shares appear undervalued.
