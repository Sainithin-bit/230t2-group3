 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Aramark Corp. RMK.N, which accepted a $6.3 billion buyout offer in August, reported lower quarterly profit on Wednesday, hurt by costs for shutting down a business and professional fees related to its takeover. 

 The company, which operates businesses including uniforms, food service and facilities management, said net income fell to $74.4 million, or 40 cents per share, in the fiscal fourth quarter that ended September 29, from $91.6 million, or 49 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. Sales rose 5 percent to $2.93 billion. Aramark, which provides food to sports stadiums, schools and hospitals, has agreed to be bought by a group led by its chairman and several investment funds, who will pay $33.80 in cash. The deal is expected to close in late 2006 or early 2007. The company said that because of that deal, it will not hold a conference call to discuss its quarterly results. Aramark said its lower fourth-quarter earnings included costs incurred in the shutdown of its healthcare apparel direct marketing business, professional fees, and the impact of expensing stock options.
