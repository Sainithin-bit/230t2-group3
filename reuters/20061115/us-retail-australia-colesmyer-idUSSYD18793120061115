 MELBOURNE  (Reuters) - Australian retailer Coles Myer Ltd. CML.AX, which last month rejected an A$18.2 billion (US$14 billion) bid from a private equity consortium, posted a weaker-than-expected 3.2 percent rise in first-quarter sales, sending its shares down more than 1 percent. 

 The company, Australia's second-largest retailer after Woolworths Ltd. ( WOW.AX ), reaffirmed its forecast for little change in annual earnings as it cuts costs and overhauls it operations, pursuing plans it says will drive more value than the rejected bid. "The first quarter sales figures in a number of respects are a little bit disappointing, however the company has maintained its profit guidance for the full year," Shaw Stockbroking analyst Scott Marshall said. "The market needs further confidence that the company is able to achieve its profit target." Coles Myer, which in the past year has sold its Myer department stores, said sales from continuing businesses were A$8.5 billion ($6.5 billion) for the 13 weeks ended October 29, up from A$8.2 billion a year ago, but below an average forecast of A$8.77 billion from two analysts surveyed by Reuters. Coles Myer shares were down 0.9 percent at A$13.61 in early afternoon trade in a wider market up 0.4 percent. Its major food and liquor division posted sales growth of 6.3 percent in the first quarter, with comparable sales from stores open at least a year rising 3.3 percent, excluding Bi-Lo supermarkets which are in the process of being rebranded as Coles stores. Food inflation was about 4 percent during the quarter, driven by escalating fresh food prices. The informal takeover offer, from a private equity consortium led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, would have been Australia's biggest corporate takeover. It valued Coles Myer at an earnings multiple a third higher than that commanded by world market leader Wal-Mart. IMPROVEMENTS EXPECTED Coles Chief Executive John Fletcher said rebranded stores were achieving sales increases averaging around 7-8 percent and comparable store sales growth overall was expected to improve as the wider business improvement plan took effect. "We think as the strategic initiatives do gain traction, we do expect food and liquor comps to continue to trend upwards," he told reporters. The company's Target variety stores posted a 2.8 percent rise in comparable store sales, but weaker comparable sales were reported from its Kmart discount variety stores, Officeworks and the Coles Express fuel and convenience store business. Coles Express comparable sales fell 5.7 percent as a store network upgrade program started during the quarter caused some disruption. The company said Kmart posted an overall sales rise of 1.2 percent, while comparable sales fell 2.2 percent as it divested its Tyremaster wholesale business and three Garden SuperCentres and phased out unprofitable lines in some categories. Fletcher said the impact of rising interest rates and the drought, offset by a fall in fuel prices, was likely to see its shoppers "remaining cautious and value-conscious", but he said the food and liquor business would be less affected. "I think supermarkets is one of those businesses where people tend to be pretty consistent in their buying behaviors," he said. The company has forecast a flat net profit of A$787 million this year and has also forecast a profit of A$1.066 billion in fiscal 2008. Rival Woolworths last month posted a 21 percent rise in its first quarter sales, boosted by acquisitions, and said its comparable food and liquor sales from stores open at least a year increased 4.9 percent.
