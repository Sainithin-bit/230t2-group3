 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - McDonald's Corp. ( MCD.N ), the world's largest hamburger chain, expects to return at least $10 billion to shareholders from 2006 through 2008, the company's chief financial officer said on Wednesday. 

 Chief Executive Jim Skinner also outlined some of the company's plans during a presentation in New York, which was broadcast over the Internet. Skinner said that McDonald's was still working very hard on lowering the level of trans fats in its french fries. He said the company plans to comply with New York City's law to limit the level of trans fats in restaurants should an ordinance be passed. Chicken salads and a low-priced chicken snack wrap have been part of McDonald's growth strategy this year. Skinner said that the company was working on a new premium chicken salad and new versions of the chicken snack wrap. It is also testing a pressure cooker to use for chicken, he said. Other test items include cinnamon buns and burritos for the breakfast menu. McDonald's is also looking at adding more "grab and go" beverages, Skinner told investors at the Morgan Stanley Global Consumer & Retail Conference. Another area Skinner discussed was advertising. He said that television now represents 70 percent of McDonald's advertising budget, down from 85 percent five years ago, as the company has beefed up its effort to reach customers online. CFO Matthew Paull also said that McDonald's still expects to spend $1.8 billion on capital expenditures in 2006. The company plans to spend $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion on capital expenditures in 2007, Paull said. Shares of Oak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald's rose 22 cents, or 0.53 percent, to $41.49 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
