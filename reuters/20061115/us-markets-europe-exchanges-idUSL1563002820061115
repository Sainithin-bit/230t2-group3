 LONDON/FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Deutsche Boerse ( DB1Gn.DE ) dropped its bid for Euronext ENXT.PA on Wednesday, dashing some industry hopes for a pan-European tie-up just hours after a group of investment banks unveiled plans for their own European marketplace. 

 The management of Euronext, which runs the Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels and Lisbon stock exchanges, has repeatedly rebuffed Deutsche Boerse in preference for an agreed bid from the New York Stock Exchange operator NYSE Group Inc. NYX.N. Confirming a Reuters report on Tuesday, Deutsche Boerse said in a brief statement it would "stop all preparatory steps including the regulatory and merger control processes". "They were never going to win but now will have to tie up with maybe the Scandinavian or southern European exchanges," said one analyst who declined to be named. "They will be forced to join in as a junior partner with either the London Stock Exchange ( LSE.L ) or Euronext," he added. Deutsche Boerse's withdrawal from the bid battle derails plans for a pan-European securities trading group, which have been cherished by many in continental Europe's financial industry as well as monetary policy makers and politicians. By 0951 GMT shares in Deutsche Boerse were down 2.1 percent at 128.20 euros, while Euronext shares were down 4 percent at 86.3 euros. Dealers said the shares were rattled by the set-back for European consolidation as well as fears that the investment banks' plans for a rival pan-European exchange would take away market share. SERIOUS THREAT Citigroup ( C.N ), Credit Suisse ( CSGN.VX ), Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ), Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ), Merrill Lynch MER.N, Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) and UBS ( UBSN.VX ) said in a statement they would form a new company with an independent management team to create a new pan-European equity trading platform next year. Dealers and analysts said the banks' move was a tactic to force the London Stock Exchange and others to lower its fees, bearing in mind that the European Union's new Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) to open up cross-border European trading in financial markets is set to take effect in a year's time. "If it doesn't then the banks will start their own reporting system and there is already pressure from Chi-X Instinet's platform," said another dealer - referring to electronic brokerage Instinet's new alternative low-cost European trading system. "This is a big blow for the LSE if they do not react in a positive manner." Andrew Mitchell, analyst at Fox-Pitt, Kelton said the venture was potentially a serious threat to the main equities exchanges in Europe. "The combination of MiFID's focus on clearing and settlement should facilitate this." In September a grouping of the same seven investment banks along with ABN AMRO AAH.AS and HSBC ( HSBA.L ) ( 0005.HK ) had already said they planned to set up their own system for reporting share trades, bypassing major European bourses. But the banks have a challenge on their hands if they are to win where previous attempts to create rival exchanges, such as Nasdaq Europe and Jiway, have failed, analysts said. "Stealing liquidity is never easy," said one who declined to be named. No one at long-running bid target the London Stock Exchange, whose shares rose last week on speculation that a new bid was imminent -- possibly from major shareholder Nasdaq Stock Markets ( NDAQ.O ) -- was available to comment. Shares in the exchange were down 4.7 percent at 1,247 pence at 1013 GMT, valuing it at around 3.3 billion pounds ($6.26 billion). (Additional reporting by  Marcel Michelson  in Paris) ($1=.5272 Pound)
