 TOKYO  (Reuters) - The Nikkei share average slipped 0.28 percent on Wednesday as domestic demand-linked stocks such as Fast Retailing Co. Ltd. ( 9983.T ) fell on profit-taking. 

 But the market losses were limited as chip-related issues such as Tokyo Electron Ltd. ( 8035.T ) benefited from expectations of growing demand. Shares of Myojo Foods Co. Ltd. 2900.T shot up after bigger rival Nissin Food Products ( 2897.T ) said it would bid 870 yen a share for Myojo, which is fighting a hostile takeover bid from U.S. hedge fund Steel Partners.  Stronger-than-expected gross domestic product data released on Tuesday continued to support share prices, but some voiced caution over the outlook for the economy and share prices. "The GDP was a relief to investors but recent economic data have been mixed," said Yutaka Shiraki, a senior strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities Co. Ltd. "Corporate earnings for the next fiscal year will be affected by the economic recovery, and investors are not confident about that outlook." The Nikkei  .N225  was 46.08 points lower at 16,243.47, after booking a 1.7 percent gain on Tuesday on the strong GDP numbers. The broader TOPIX index was down 0.28 percent at 1,592.00. Soichiro Monji, chief strategist in the equity management department at Daiwa SB Investments, said foreign investors have cut their exposure to Japanese stocks this year, putting the market under pressure. "There seems to be a trend where fund managers allocate more money in markets which are rising," he said. "Those outperforming stock markets draw more money." His comment came after a Merrill Lynch survey for November that showed that the number of global fund managers who said they want to overweight Japanese stocks in the next 12 months fell to 5 percent from 12 percent. Merrill said 5 percent was the lowest since December 2003. Trade volume slowed, with 1.6 billion shares changing hands, compared with 1.8 billion shares on Tuesday. Decliners outnumbered advancers by a ratio of nearly two to one. MYOJO SURGES Myojo Foods, facing a hostile bid from Steel Partners, ended up 13.1 percent at 861 yen, slightly below the bid price of 870 yen offered by Nissin Food. Tokyo Electron rose 1.8 percent to 8,920 yen. The microchip equipment maker said on Tuesday net profit jumped 55 percent due to strong demand from makers of computer memory chips, ahead of Microsoft's launch of the Windows Vista operating system. Other chip-related shares also headed up, with Advantest Corp. ( 6857.T ), a chip-testing equipment maker, jumping 3.8 percent to 6,220 yen and electronic chipmaker Elpida Memory Inc. 6665.T adding 2.2 percent to 5,530 yen. Concern about profit growth dragged down shares of consumer finance companies, which have been hit by falling loan demand and legal claims as their coercive debt collection practices and other violations came to the fore. Aiful Corp. ( 8515.T ) dropped 4.1 percent to 3,750 yen, and Credit Saison Co. Ltd. ( 8253.T ) dropped 4.2 percent to 3,870 yen. The market was dragged down by losses in shares of some firms that rely on domestic demand such as Fast Retailing and KDDI Corp. ( 9433.T ). Fast Retailing fell 2.4 percent to 9,990 yen and KDDI shed 1.8 percent to 750,000 yen. These stocks, which rose a day earlier on the strong GDP data, retreated as investors started to worry that the outlook for the world's second-largest economy is still not that strong. After the market closed, Tokyo Broadcasting System Inc. ( 9401.T ) said its half-year operating profit grew 96 percent from a year ago but stuck by its full-year forecast due partly to sluggish advertisement revenues. The stock ended down 2.7 percent at 2,515 yen.
