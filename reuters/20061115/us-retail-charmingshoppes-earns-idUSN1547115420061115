 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Charming Shoppes Inc. CHRS.O, a retailer that specializes in plus-size apparel for women, posted an 80 percent jump in quarterly earnings on Wednesday after better inventory management helped boost profit margins, but shares sagged on fears sales growth could slow due to disappointing denim demand and less seasonal merchandise. 

 The stock had risen more than 3 percent in early trading, its highest level since 1993, but after a conference call in which the company said premium denim sales at its Lane Bryant stores had lagged expectations and that it would limit its Fashion Bug chain's fall holiday offerings, shares slid as much as 5 percent. "There are several factors that will limit potential upside in the near term," C.L. King analyst Scott Krasik wrote in a research note, referring to the Lane Bryant and Fashion Bug outlook. He cut his stock rating to "neutral" from "strong buy" and said the share price already reflected the business outlook for the company and there was little room for gains. Charming Shoppes reported third-quarter net income of $19.4 million, or 15 cents per share, compared with $10.8 million, or 9 cents per share, for the year-ago quarter. Analysts surveyed by Reuters Estimates had forecast earnings of 13 cents per share, on average. Sales rose 5 percent to $695.3 million. "Entering the quarter with clean inventories resulted in improvements in our merchandise margin, which contributed to our better-than-planned earnings results," Dorrit Bern, chairman, chief executive officer and president, said in a statement. Consolidated gross margin rose to 31.2 percent, up from 30.4 percent. The company also said demand at its outlet stores also helped boost results. SAME-STORE SALES Same-store sales, a measure of sales at stores open at least a year, rose 1 percent during the quarter, a result the company called disappointing. Comparable-store sales at the company's Lane Bryant unit were flat, which it attributed to disappointing sales for its premium denim offerings. Additionally, Charming Shoppes said it would keep to its strategy of cutting back on seasonal inventories at its Fashion Bug chain. "That could have some implications on top line but it absolutely gives you the opportunity to expand gross and operating margin," said Chief Financial Officer Eric Specter, in a conference call. After its better-than-expected third-quarter results, the company said it had raised its full-year earnings outlook to 84 cents to 85 cents per share, from its earlier forecast for earnings the range of 81 cents to 83 cents per share. Analysts expected full-year profit of 82 cents per share. For the fourth quarter, the company said it still expects earnings of 21 cents to 22 cents per share, on sales of $880 million to $890 million. Analysts are looking for earnings of 21 cents per share, on revenue of $873.2 million. Charming Shoppes shares were down 69 cents at $14.39, compared with a 0.7 percent gain for the Dow Jones US apparel and retail index. .DJUSRA The stock was selling for 15.5 times next year's expected earnings, as of Tuesday's close, compared with an average 17.2 times average earnings for companies in the apparel and retail index.
