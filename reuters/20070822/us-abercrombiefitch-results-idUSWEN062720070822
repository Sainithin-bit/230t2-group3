 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Abercrombie & Fitch Co ( ANF.N ) posted a 24 percent rise in quarterly net earnings on Wednesday as a larger number of stores helped offset weakened sales at older outlets. 

 The company also forecast full-year earnings below analysts' average estimate, and its shares fell 1.7 percent in extended trade. Abercrombie, a mall-based retailer of trendy fashions for teenagers and college-age men and women, said second-quarter net profit increased to $81.3 million, or 88 cents per share, from $65.7 million, or 72 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts, on average, had been expecting earnings of 87 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Total sales gained 22 percent to $804.5 million, above analysts' average estimate of $772.01 million, according to Reuters Estimates. Same-store sales, a key retail measure that tracks sales at stores open at least a year, fell 2 percent during the quarter. For the full year, Abercrombie forecast earnings of between $5.16 and $5.20 per share. Analysts were expecting earnings, on average, of $5.24 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. The retailer said the low end of its full-year outlook assumes flat same-store sales for the second half of the year. Abercrombie shares fell to $76.30 in after-hours trading after closing at $77.63, down 2.2 percent, on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by  Nichola Groom , editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)
