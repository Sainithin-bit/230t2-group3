 (Reuters) - Banks and financial services companies with banking operations are in the process of cutting tens of thousands of jobs. 

 Some have said they are reducing staffing to lower their cost structures. Others are doing so because interest rate changes have made it more difficult to profit from lending. Still others are reacting to tightening credit conditions, especially for mortgage lending operations. Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc., the consulting firm, said on Tuesday the U.S. financial industry has announced 87,962 job cuts this year, 75 percent more than in all of 2006. It said 35,830 of the cuts, or 41 percent, relate to housing market problems. The following is a selection of U.S. financial companies that have set job cuts this year or are otherwise reducing staffing. ACCREDITED HOME LENDERS HOLDING CO. LEND.O Accredit Home Lenders, a subprime lender, said on Wednesday it will cut 1,600 jobs. The San Diego-based company said it will close nearly all of its retail lending branches and support centers, as well as five of its 10 wholesale divisions, effective September 5. Staff will also be laid off in the company's Inzura Settlement Services unit and its headquarters. BEAR STEARNS COS BSC.N Bear Stearns, a Wall Street investment bank, on August 16 said it will cut 240 subprime lending jobs, including 100 at its Encore Credit unit and 140 at its Bear Stearns Residential unit.

( C.N ) Citigroup, the largest bank, on April 11 said it will eliminate 17,000 jobs and move an additional 9,500 jobs to lower-cost locations, hoping to save $4.58 billion annually by 2009. The New York-based company at the time said it employed roughly 327,000 people. COUNTRYWIDE FINANCIAL CORP. CFC.N Countrywide, the largest mortgage lender, on August 20 said it eliminated about 500 jobs last week in its Full Spectrum division, which lends to people who do not qualify for the best rates, and the subprime unit of its wholesale lending division. The Calabasas, California-based company had added nearly 7,000 workers in 2007 before facing a credit shortfall. FIRST MAGNUS FINANCIAL CORP. The privately held mortgage lender filed for bankruptcy protection on Tuesday and said it had laid off most of its nearly 6,000 workers, leaving it with about 60 employees. The Tucson, Arizona-based company was the 16th-largest U.S. mortgage lender from January to June. H&R BLOCK INC.
