 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Tech Data Corp ( TECD.O ), the world's second-largest distributor of computer products, posted a higher-than expected quarterly profit on Wednesday on strong growth in the Americas, sending its shares up 6.9 percent. 

 The company also gave a revenue forecast for the current quarter that topped Wall Street expectations, soothing some concerns that U.S. technology spending could be hurt by the recent turmoil in credit markets. "Despite the market concern on credit thus far, IT spending has remained steady and the expectation is it is going to continue to do so for the back half of the year," said Needham & Co analyst Richard Kugele. Tech Data did not give a forecast for the full year, but Kugele said the company's optimism appeared to confirm earlier signs of a strong outlook for technology spending. Its shares were up $2.43 at $37.66 on the Nasdaq in early afternoon trade, off their day-high of $39.41. Shares of larger rival Ingram Micro Inc ( IM.N ) rose as much as 4 percent before falling back to $18.68, up just under 1 percent, on the New York Stock Exchange. Tech Data posted net income of $7.2 million, or 13 cents a share, for its fiscal second quarter ended July 31, compared with a loss of $155.5 million, or $2.81 a share, a year ago when it took charges for goodwill impairment and other items. Before items such as restructuring charges, Tech Data earned 50 cents a share, compared with average analyst estimates for 30 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose about 13 percent to $5.6 billion, compared with average analyst estimates for $5.295 billion. Company executives told analysts on a conference call that the results beat internal expectations on almost every metric and that Tech Data had gained market share among small and medium business customers, as well as in Latin America. Tech Data said Hewlett-Packard Co ( HPQ.N ) is its biggest revenue generator. "It was a very good quarter. They showed excellent growth in the Americas, which was a combination of a resurgence in the (personal computer) market in the U.S. and the rest of the Americas," said Pacific Crest analyst Andy Hargreaves. Tech Data was also helped by favorable currency exchange rates in Europe, Middle East and Africa, according to Hargreaves. "It's a company that has been underperforming their closest peer for the last couple of years. The fact they're showing a bit of potential is getting people excited," Hargreaves said, comparing Tech Data to Ingram Micro. Tech Data forecast third-quarter sales of $5.75 billion to $5.90 billion, ahead of average analyst estimates for revenue of $5.67 billion. The estimate assumes growth in the low double-digit percentage range in the Americas and flat-to-low single-digit growth in Europe on a local currency basis, the company said. Semiconductor analyst Cody Acree of Stifel Nicolaus said Tech Data's results, which followed signs of strong PC demand from the quarterly reports from HP, Intel Corp ( INTC.O ) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc ( AMD.N ), was good news for microchip makers. "We believe the strong PC demand, matched with tight supply, is the indicator of what investors should expect from the broad chip sector through the second half, barring a major economic slowdown," Acree said in a note to clients. "We expect the growing orders rates to bleed across most major verticals - particularly wireless, consumer electronics, networking, and telecommunications," he added. Intel shares were up 0.7 percent at $24.06 and AMD shares were flat at $12.17. HP shares rose 0.4 percent to $46.18. (Additional reporting by  Euan Rocha  and  Paul Thomasch )
