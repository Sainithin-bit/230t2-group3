 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Toll Brothers Inc, the largest U.S. luxury home builder, on Wednesday reported a better-than-expected yet sharply lower quarterly profit amid tightening credit standards it said would likely shrink the number of potential home buyers. 

 U.S. home builders have been suffering though a severe downturn initially fueled by soaring home prices and a rise in mortgage rates that drove some buyers out of the market. But the industry's problems have worsened due to a crisis in the credit market derived from rising defaults by subprime borrowers, who are generally people with the riskiest credit. "We, along with many others, are concerned about the dislocation in the secondary mortgage market," Chief Executive Robert Toll said in a conference call with analysts. Bank of America, which recently downgraded Toll shares to "sell" from "neutral," said Toll's language does not bode well for the company's current quarter, which so far has seen a more severe tightening of credit. "We think the lack of liquidity in the mortgage market and resulting higher spreads will negatively impact sales going forward," Daniel Oppenheim wrote in a research note. Still, Toll's results and speculation that the Federal Reserve may cut its benchmark interest rate helped send Toll shares up 5 percent to close at $22.15 on the New York Stock Exchange. In the third quarter ended July 31, Toll's net income fell to $26.5 million, or 16 cents per share, from $174.6 million, or $1.07 per share, a year earlier. The results include pretax write-downs of $147.3 million for operating communities primarily in Florida, Las Vegas and California. Better margins helped Toll beat the 5 cents per share expected by analysts, according to Reuters Estimates. WCI Communities Inc, whose business is concentrated in Florida and focuses on building high-rise condos, posted a second-quarter loss on Wednesday of $33.2 million, or 79 cents per share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $22.7 million, or 52 cents per share. Shares of WCI closed down nearly 3 percent at $7.72. "Very simply, traffic is horrible," Robert Toll said on a conference call with analysts. "This past week was the lowest traffic for this particular week ever in our history. And that condition has existed pretty much for the last nine weeks." Mortgage rates, especially for jumbo mortgages of more than $417,000, have soared in the past month as credit fears have spread to loans for borrowers with better credit. Forty-six percent of Toll buyers use jumbo loans, according to Toll. The average sale price of a Toll home during the quarter was  $658,000. On Wednesday, Toll said it received a commitment from Citizens Bank, a mortgage lender and unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland to take $500 million worth of jumbo loans. "We set out looking for guys that would put it in writing and say to us, send us your stuff and we will provide shelter," Robert Toll said on the call. "The market is very focused on whether Toll Brothers will be able to take care of its mortgage needs because of dislocations in the mortgage market." JPMorgan Chase & Co, Countrywide Financial Corp, IndyMac Bancorp Inc and Wells Fargo & Co also buy jumbo loans initiated by Toll's mortgage origination unit, TBI Mortgage. The company reiterated it would not issue any projections because of uncertain market conditions. Toll said that through the third quarter, its buyers were generally able to obtain both standard and larger loans. "Nevertheless, tightening credit standards will likely shrink the pool of potential home buyers," Robert Toll said. "Mortgage market liquidity issues and higher borrowing rates may impede some customers from closing, while others may find it more difficult to sell their existing homes," he said.
