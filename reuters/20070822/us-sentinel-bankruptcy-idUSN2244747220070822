 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Sentinel Management Group Inc, the cash management firm that filed for Chapter 11 protection last week and was subsequently hit with civil fraud charges by U.S. regulators, has asked the judge overseeing its bankruptcy to appoint an independent trustee. 

 In an emergency motion filed with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Illinois late on Tuesday, the company said the move was necessary because actions taken by regulators were preventing executives from conducting normal business. On Monday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil fraud charges against Sentinel, alleging it defrauded clients by improperly commingling, misappropriating and leveraging their securities without their knowledge. That action followed an earlier order from the National Futures Association, the self-regulator for the futures industry, prohibiting Sentinel from "liquidating, selling, transferring, encumbering or otherwise disposing of any securities." The motion is likely to be supported by attorneys representing the company's more than 200 creditors. They were expected to push for the appointment of an outside trustee on Thursday, when the court takes up the issue. In a crowded hearing in court earlier this week, Christian Kemnitz, an attorney representing Discus Fund, an investment partnership based in the British Virgin Islands that was one of Sentinel's biggest clients, accused the company of "disturbing" and "illegal" behavior. "There's more going on here than simple mismanagement," Kemnitz said. In a statement earlier on Wednesday, Discus estimated its monetary exposure was $407 million and it warned "it is uncertain to what degree the Fund will be able to recover its assets (if any) from Sentinel."
