 (Reuters) - Subprime lender Delta Financial Corp. DFC.O said it has cut about 300 jobs, or 20 percent of its workforce, to address the expected decrease in loan originations resulting from the deterioration of credit markets. 

 The Woodbury, New York-based company also said it will take a related pre-tax charge of $2.0 million to $2.5 million in the current third quarter. (Reporting by Sweta Singh in Bangalore)
