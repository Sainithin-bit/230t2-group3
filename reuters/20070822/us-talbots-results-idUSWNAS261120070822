 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Women's apparel retailer Talbots Inc. TLB.N posted a wider quarterly net loss on Wednesday, hurt by weak sales and costs related to its acquisition of the J. Jill chain. 

 Talbots posted a net loss of $13.3 million, or 25 cents per share, for the fiscal second quarter ended August 4, compared with a loss of $3.9 million, or 7 cents per share, a year earlier. The latest results include acquisition-related and financing costs of 10 cents per share, the company said. Earlier this month Talbots forecast a net loss in the range of 25 cents to 27 cents per share, surprising analysts, who had been expecting a profit of 2 cents per share. Talbots said at that time that sales at stores open at least a year had fallen 4.8 percent in the quarter, citing a significant decline in customer traffic and a weak response to its spring and summer clothes. It said it had a poor June and a "particularly difficult" July. Total sales in the quarter were $572.3 million, up slightly from $571.4 million a year ago. The company affirmed its outlook for the second half of the year on Wednesday, saying it expects same-store sales to be about flat with last year. If it meets its sales goals, Talbots said it should earn 42 cents to 48 cents per share in the second half and 27 cents to 33 cents per share for the full year. Analysts on average were expecting 28 cents per share, excluding items, for the full year, according to Reuters Estimates. "Although our current sales trends are in line with our recently revised outlook, we remain cautious, due to the economic environment arising from the current housing issues and the uncertainty in the finance and credit markets," the company said in a statement.
