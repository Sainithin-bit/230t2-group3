 KANSAS CITY, Missouri  (Reuters) - Frontier Futures Inc., a discount brokerage specializing in commodities, said Wednesday it was closing its Kansas City wheat trading office due to fallout from the collapse of the Sentinel Management Group Inc., which handled some cash management services for Frontier. 

 "We are closing the office there," said Frontier President Ted Johnson in a telephone interview from the company's home office in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. "For the most part, it is fallout from the Sentinel collapse. We were affected by that. In light of that we decided to close that office and concentrate on other aspects of our business. Today will probably be the last day," he said. The 23-year-old firm operated its Kansas City office at the Kansas City Board of Trade, the world's largest futures market for hard red winter wheat. Johnson said Frontier was planning to keep open offices at the Chicago Board of Trade, a large market for soft red winter wheat, corn and soy trading, and at the Minneapolis Grain Exchange for spring wheat futures trade. "We will remain a member of Minneapolis ... and continue to do business as we have done in Chicago. At least that is the plan at this point," said Johnson. The decision to close the Kansas City office was made last week, Johnson said. Sentinel Management Group filed for Chapter 11 protection last week and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has filed civil fraud charges against the firm, alleging it defrauded clients by improperly commingling, misappropriating and leveraging their securities without their knowledge. That action followed an earlier order from the National Futures Association, the self-regulator for the futures industry, prohibiting Sentinel from "liquidating, selling, transferring, encumbering or otherwise disposing of any securities." General skittishness surrounding market events led rival commodities trading house Country Hedging to issue a notice to its customers on Wednesday reassuring them about Country Hedging's financial security. The notice from Country Hedging President Scott Cordes told customers the "financial strength" of parent company CHS Inc. gave it "ample resources for additional assurance."
