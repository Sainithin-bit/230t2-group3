 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - It is not the job of the U.S. central bank to protect individual risk-takers, but the system itself, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Richard Fisher said in a magazine article published on Wednesday. 

 The Dallas Fed said the interview with International Economy was conducted in June. "I don't mind tears among individual market operators, as long as we don't get tears in the fabric of the financial system," Fisher said. "I do not believe the Federal Reserve's job is to protect against the failure of specific risk-takers. Its job is to protect the system," he said.
