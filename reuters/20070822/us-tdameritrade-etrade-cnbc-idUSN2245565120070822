 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - TD Ameritrade Holding Corp ( AMTD.O ) is still talking to competitors about a potential combination as it disclosed in a regulatory filing several weeks ago, its chief executive officer said in an interview with CNBC television on Wednesday. 

 TD Ameritrade CEO Joe Moglia declined to comment on a Wall Street Journal report that the online brokerage was in talks with E*Trade Financial Corp ( ETFC.O ) about a potential merger. "If we were having discussions with E*Trade or anyone else we would not be able to talk about that," he said. (Reporting by  Christian Plumb )
