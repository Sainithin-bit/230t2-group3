 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve officials are cautiously optimistic that the steps they have taken to relieve a squeeze in credit markets are working and may wait until their next policy meeting before considering a rate cut, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. 

 The paper said Fed officials acknowledged that conditions are far from calm and could take a turn for the worse, but a pick-up in issuance of jumbo mortgages and steadying stock markets were evidence of improving conditions. "As long as Fed officials think things are getting better, they are less likely to feel pressured to cut interest rates immediately and more likely to wait until their scheduled meeting (on) September 18 to decide," the Journal reported on its Web site without citing sources. The article was written by the Journal's Fed reporter Greg Ip, who is known for sometimes reflecting the thinking of senior policymakers. The Fed cut the discount rate for banks borrowing directly from the central bank last Friday and has pumped extra funds into the market to help relieve the crunch from fears about banks and funds suffering losses from U.S. subprime mortgages. The market troubles, which have seen investors shift funds into ultra-safe U.S. Treasury bills as stocks and corporate bonds fell sharply, have stoked expectations the Fed may make a rare cut in the benchmark fed funds rate in between meetings. In a statement accompanying its decision to cut the discount rate, the Fed said downside risks to economic growth have risen appreciably and said it was monitoring the situation, wording that in the past has preceded an inter-meeting rate cut. Just two weeks ago the Fed had kept rates on hold at 5.25 percent at a regular policy meeting held before market volatility flared up.
