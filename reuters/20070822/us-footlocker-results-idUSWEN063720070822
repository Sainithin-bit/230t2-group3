 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Foot Locker Inc ( FL.N ) reported a second-quarter net loss on Wednesday, as markdowns and falling sales at stores open at least a year hurt results. 

 Citing factors such as a challenging market for athletic goods, the largest U.S. retailer of athletic shoes and apparel declined to issue a forecast for the current quarter. New York-based Foot Locker said net loss in the fiscal quarter ended August 4 was $18 million, or 12 cents per share, compared with net income of $14 million, or 9 cents per share, in the year-ago period. The results topped analysts' consensus estimate of 18 cents per share as compiled by Reuters Estimates. Second-quarter sales declined 1.5 percent to $1.28 million as same-stores sales fell 7.3 percent. The company, which is also Nike Inc's ( NKE.N ) largest customer, plans to close 135 to 150 unproductive stores and to open about 40 new stores during the next six months. Foot Locker and rival Finish Line ( FINL.O ) have seen sales slump due to softness in the U.S. athletic shoe market and weak sales in Europe. Foot Locker shares fell 31 cents, or nearly 2 percent, to close at $15.53 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by  Lisa Baertlein )
