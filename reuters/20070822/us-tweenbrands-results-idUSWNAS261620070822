 (Reuters) - Apparel retailer Tween Brands Inc TWB.N reported a lower second-quarter profit due to a decline in retail traffic and lower store transactions. 

 The company earned $2.1 million, or 7 cents a share, compared with $5.9 million, or 18 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. Net sales rose 15 percent to $213.7 million. Comparable store sales for the quarter fell 2 percent. (Reporting by Swagata Gupta in Bangalore)
