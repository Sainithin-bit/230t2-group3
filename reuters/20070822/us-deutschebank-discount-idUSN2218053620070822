 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank said on Wednesday it borrowed money directly from the U.S. Federal Reserve, making it one of at least five banks that borrowed from the Fed. 

 Deutsche Bank spokesman Ted Meyer said in an emailed statement that the bank could have secured funds at cheaper sources elsewhere, but borrowed from the Fed on Friday to support the central bank's efforts to boost liquidity in the market. (Reporting by  Dan Wilchins )
