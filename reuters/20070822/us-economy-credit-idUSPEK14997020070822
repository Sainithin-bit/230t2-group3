 CHICAGO/LONDON  (Reuters) - A semblance of calm returned to global money markets on Wednesday as investors ditched some of their safe-haven positions and four top U.S. banks made a show of support for the Federal Reserve. 

 After cutting its discount rate for direct lending to banks last Friday, rumors still swirled that Fed will take additional steps in coming days, including a cut to the fed funds target rate for overnight interbank lending, its key monetary policy tool. But for now efforts by the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank in particular to deal with the worst liquidity and credit squeeze in a decade have helped stabilize financial markets, and perhaps given the U.S. central bank time to wait for fresh data to test its view that the economy is still sound. Investors even returned to believing a European Central Bank rate rise in September would go ahead as expected, another sign that "business as usual" is overtaking "panic stations." U.S. shares rose moderately on improving liquidity and credit conditions with the main U.S. stock indexes up by more than 1.0 pct, after the benchmark S&P500 index lost about 10 pct in the past few weeks. Investors seeking a safe haven for their cash have pushed short-term Treasury note and bill yields toward two-year lows this week, but the first wave of those positions was abandoned on Wednesday. The two-year Treasury note yield rose to 4.17 percent from 4.04 percent, its biggest once-day rise so far this year. The four largest U.S. banks bellied up to the Fed discount window on Wednesday to borrow $500 million each, saying they made the move for the sake of the financial system even though they have ample access to funds elsewhere. Borrowing money directly from the Fed is often seen as a sign of weakness, but JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America, Citigroup and Wachovia Corp. all took one for the team. The move "was likely an orchestrated show of support for the Fed's attempt to calm markets by lowering the discount rate," said Drew Matus, U.S. senior financial markets economist at Lehman Brothers. In short-term interest rate futures, which track sentiment toward Fed policy, the market was left evenly split on the chances of a 25 basis point or a 50 basis point cut at the September 18th FOMC meeting. On Tuesday betting was heavily in favor of a 50 basis point rate cut. Comments published on Wednesday by Richard Fisher, president of the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank, suggested he would be opposed to a rate cut unless conditions deteriorated further. Interviewed by "International Economy" magazine in June, Fisher, a former hedge fund manager, said it was not the Fed's job to "protect against the failure of specific risk-takers." That meshed with comments from others Fed officials, both before the current financial crisis developed and, in the case of Fed Presidents William Poole of St. Louis and Jeffrey Lacker of Richmond, over the past week. Many now suspect that if markets can limp through the next few days without falling apart, the Fed will be inclined to wait for big economic reports due in late August through mid-September and take up the policy cudgel at its scheduled meeting, not before. A Reuters poll showed that 45 of 63 economists surveyed look for the Fed to cut the federal funds rate by the September 18 meeting, in most cases by 25 basis points, but only six anticipated a cut before the scheduled meeting. TURNAROUND WEDNESDAY Investors got some positive news from IndyMac Bancorp Inc, the ninth biggest U.S. mortgage lender. The Pasadena, California, company said on Wednesday it has resumed making "jumbo" residential home loans, defined as loans above $417,000 to borrowers with strong credit scores, after earlier financial markets disruptions forced a pullback. Analysts said the news suggested that much of the $10 trillion U.S. mortgage market could escape further problems. Some also saw grounds for hope after French bank BNP Paribas said it planned to re-open three investment funds frozen earlier this month because their net asset values could not be calculated. Elsewhere, though, the U.S. mortgage crisis only deepened as Accredited Home Lendings Co, HSBC Holdings Plc and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc all announced job cuts. Housing-related job losses announced since Thursday total more than 12,300. Many of the cuts related to subprime lending, which involves loans to people with weaker credit, and has been the root cause of this months credit squeeze. ECONOMY UNSCATHED? Still, indicating liquidity problems were far from over, the ECB said it would hold a tender to add 40 billion euros in 91-day funds to the euro money market on Thursday, "a technical measure aimed at supporting the normalization" of the market. In a statement, the ECB reminded markets of the policy stance at its rate-setting Governing Council on August 2, a move some analysts viewed as a signal that it was still likely to raise interest rates at its September 6 meeting. Bund and Euribor futures slid on cue. "Including that sentence suggests to us that the council continues to view the chances of a rate increase in September as high," said Jacques Cailloux, economist at RBS. Earlier, Japanese Finance Minister Koji Omi said the global economy's economic fundamentals were solid even if financial markets needed to be watched closely. Others were skeptical. IMF First Deputy Managing Director John Lipsky told the Financial Times global growth would certainly take a hit. "This undoubtedly will dampen economic growth," he said. "It will ... take some time for markets to restore a normal amount of volatility." (Additional reporting by Jonathan Stempel,  Dan Wilchins , Ed Leefeldt and  Al Yoon  in New York)
