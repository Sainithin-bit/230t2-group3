 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Hershey Co's ( HSY.N ) controlling shareholder is committed to maintaining control of the chocolate company, the trust's chairman said on Wednesday. 

 Earlier on Wednesday, a Deutsche Bank analyst said The Hershey Trust may be reconsidering its position on selling the company given its weak fundamentals. Shares of Hershey, which declined to comment on the analyst's report, rose as much as 4.6 percent before paring some of those gains in afternoon trading. "I don't know where this speculation came from, but as I have said in the past, as chairman of the board of the Hershey Trust Company, the Hershey Trust is committed under all circumstances to maintaining control of the Hershey Company, which is a very vital part of the Milton Hershey legacy," LeRoy Zimmerman told Reuters. Hershey's roots date to 1894. Hershey Trust exercises voting rights on behalf of the Milton Hershey School Trust, for which it has been as trustee since 1909. In April, Zimmerman said the trust had no interest in giving up its voting power, damping speculation the largest U.S. chocolate maker might combine with Britain's Cadbury Schweppes Plc CBRY.L. Cadbury buying Hershey may be more likely than Hershey buying Cadbury and other bidders could emerge, Deutsche Bank analyst Eric Katzman, who has a "hold" rating on Hershey, wrote in the note. "With fundamentals deteriorating ... and the benefit of announcing restructuring initiatives largely played out, we believe that Hershey is looking at strategic options," Katzman wrote. Zimmerman said in April that the trust had "absolute confidence" in Hershey management, including Chief Executive Richard Lenny, and its plans to cut costs and regain market share from rivals, including Mars Inc. Speculation about a possible tie-up with Cadbury rose in March after the British company said it would split its confectionary and drinks units in two. Hershey Trust Co considered a sale of Hershey five years ago, but pulled the company off the market in September 2002 following opposition from Pennsylvania officials and community groups, who feared plant closures and job losses. Katzman said Wm. Wrigley Jr Co WWY.N, Nestle SA ( NESN.VX ) and Cadbury, along with other large consumer packaged goods makers, could bid for Hershey today if the trust and board were to decide on a sale. Paul Foster, an options strategist at theflyonthewall.com, said Hershey calls were active following the research report. Hershey call option volume was 8,849 contracts compared with put volume of 2,561 contracts, he said. Hershey shares closed 3 percent, or $1.34, higher at $46.54 on the New York Stock Exchange.
