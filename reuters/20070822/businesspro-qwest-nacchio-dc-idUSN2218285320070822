 DENVER  (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Wednesday 
ruled that the former chief executive of Qwest Communications 
International Inc ( Q.N ) could remain free while the court takes 
up his appeal of an insider trading conviction. 

  Joseph Nacchio's conviction and hefty fines and restitution 
requirements were seen an a major win for the U.S. government 
in its wide-ranging efforts to fight corporate corruption.  U.S. District Judge Edward Nottingham on July 27 sentenced 
Nacchio to a six-year prison term and ordered the former 
executive to begin serving it 15 days after the Federal Bureau 
of Prisons told him where to report.  But the Denver-based 10th Circuit Court of Appeals, in a 
3-0 decision, granted Nacchio's request for release on bail 
over opposition from prosecutors.  It did not give a reason for the ruling and said it would 
hear oral arguments on an as-yet-unspecified date in 
mid-December.  Nacchio also was fined $19 million and ordered to forfeit 
$52 million, the amount he grossed in stock sales based on 
information unknown to investors about the company's true 
financial picture.  Nacchio, 58, was convicted on 19 counts of insider trading 
and contends he did not get a fair trial from Nottingham.  Denver-based Qwest became the target of federal prosecutors 
and regulators in 2002 after the regional telecom restated $2.2 
billion in revenue for the previous two years. Nacchio was 
chief executive from 1997 to 2002.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil 
fraud lawsuit against Qwest and several of its former 
executives, including Nacchio, in March 2005 and he was 
indicted in the criminal case in December 2005.  The company settled with the SEC for $250 million, but its 
case against Nacchio and some of the other defendant executives 
is pending.  (Reporting by Robert Boczkiewicz in Denver; writing by
