 (Reuters) - Impac Mortgage Holdings Inc IMH.N, one of the largest "Alt-A" lenders, said it has cut 350 jobs to reduce its operating expenses. 

 Impac Mortgage said the volatility in the secondary and securitization markets has significantly limited the origination of non-conforming residential mortgages, resulting in cost-cutting initiatives. The company, whose primary product is Alt-A loans that are typically between prime and subprime in terms of quality, had said on Aug 15 it has no intention of declaring bankruptcy despite the turmoil in the mortgage market.
