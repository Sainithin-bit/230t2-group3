 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - WCI Communities Inc. WCI.N on Wednesday reported a quarterly net loss as the luxury home and condominium builder continued to struggle with the decaying U.S. housing market. 

 The company, which earlier this year rejected a $1 billion buyout bid from billionaire Carl Icahn, posted a second-quarter loss of $33.2 million, or 79 cents per share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $22.7 million, or 52 cents per share. Excluding a gain from the $47.5 million sale of a recreation facility, the loss from continuing operations was $1.07 a share, compared with a profit of 50 cents in second quarter 2006. Revenue fell 54.2 percent to $241.8 million. Revenue from high-rise condominiums dropped 99 percent to $2.1 million. The company's gross margin dropped into negative territory from 19 percent a year earlier. In high-rise, gross margins fell, and the 68 cancellations outnumbered 11 gross new orders. The total value of orders for WCI's condominium and single-family homes fell 96.2 percent to $9.1 million, while the number of unit orders declined 82.6 percent to 50, the Bonita Springs, Florida company said. WCI has suffered more than other home builders because of its focus on the Florida high-end, high-rise condominium business. Condominium development requires a buyer to put down only a fraction of construction costs. The company depends upon the buyer closing on the sale of the condominium when it is built months later to regain the cash it has spent on construction plus a profit. "It all comes down to cash flow," said JMP Securities analyst Jim Wilson. As the value of Florida condominiums have slid and mortgages have become more expensive and difficult to obtain, buyers are canceling their contracts and are walking away from their deposits. That has left WCI unable to recoup the money it has spent building the high-rises. Year-to-date, WCI has generated $119.8 million in cash flow from operating and investing activities and expects to end 2007 having generated a combined $530 million to $730 million -- $520 million to $720 million from operating activities and $10 million from investments. That forecast is based on closing 10 high-rise condominium towers and 500 to 600 traditional home sales in the second half of the year. (Reporting by  Ilaina Jonas )
