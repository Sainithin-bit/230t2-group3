 CARACAS  (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil's ( XOM.N ) legal actions against Venezuela are keeping oil prices high, Venezuelan Oil Minister Rafael Ramirez said on Wednesday in an interview with Venezuelan state television. 

 Exxon Mobil won court orders freezing up to $12 billion in assets as part of a dispute over Venezuela's 2007 nationalization of an oil project Exxon ran. Speaking from the OPEC meeting in Vienna, Ramirez said Venezuela was presenting legal arguments in a London court to "ensure this type of action does not become a precedent that would help destabilize the global oil market. "All of these actions by transnational companies ... against producer nations are keeping oil (prices) at their current levels." OPEC on Wednesday expressed support for Venezuela and its state oil company PDVSA in exercising sovereign rights as part of President Hugo Chavez's nationalization campaign last year. Oil prices hit a record of almost $104 per barrel on Monday amid concerns over the weakening of the U.S. dollar. (Reporting by Brian Ellsworth; Editing by  Christian Wiessner )
