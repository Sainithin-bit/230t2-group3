 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Tommy Hilfiger Group said on Wednesday it will bring its men's and women's footwear business in-house, ending a licensing agreement with the Stride Rite unit of Collective Brands Inc PSS.N. 

 The licensing agreement will expire on December 31, 2008. Collective Brands said it sees no material financial impact on its fiscal 2008 results from the termination. Stride Rite will remain a licensee for the Tommy Hilfiger Kids footwear line through December 31, 2009. (Reporting by Jennifer Coogan; editing by John Wallace)
