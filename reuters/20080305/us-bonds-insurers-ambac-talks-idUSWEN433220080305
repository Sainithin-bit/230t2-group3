 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Banks negotiating a rescue of Ambac Financial Group Inc ABK.N hope to finish hammering out a deal on Wednesday, CNBC reported on Wednesday morning. 

 The banks are working on a plan that would keep Ambac intact and allow it to retain its top credit ratings. Ambac is looking to raise additional capital as its expected losses have mounted from insuring securities like repackaged subprime mortgage bonds.
