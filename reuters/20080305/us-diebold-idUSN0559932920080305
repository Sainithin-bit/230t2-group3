 BOSTON  (Reuters) - The chairman of Diebold Inc ( DBD.N ) said on Wednesday United Technologies Corp's ( UTX.N ) hostile $2.64 billion bid is too low and comes at a time when the world's No. 2 maker of automated teller machines cannot entertain takeover offers. 

 Diebold's nonexecutive chairman John Lauer said in an open letter that the diversified U.S. manufacturer's $40-per-share offer is 27 percent below Diebold's 52-week high of $54.50 reached in August. "Simply put, UTX's proposed offer is far below what Diebold is worth," Lauer wrote to United Tech Chairman and Chief Executive George David. "Your overture, which comes at a time when we cannot responsibly engage in discussions, and the hostile nature of your approach, has convinced the board that discussions now will not likely result in the best outcome for our shareholders," he added. Diebold shares, which have traded a few dollars below the $40 offer price for the past two days, were down 30 cents to $37.38 on the New York Stock Exchange in afternoon dealings. United Tech said on Wednesday it remains committed to its $40 per share cash offer, and said its management team and advisers are ready to meet with Diebold and begin due diligence. "The inability of Diebold's leadership to file timely financial statements are not valid reasons to avoid a dialogue with UTC," United Tech said in a statement. Prior to United Tech's announcement of its bid, Diebold shares had lost about half their value over the prior six months as U.S. financial regulators scrutinized its revenue recognition policies. Diebold, second only to NCR Corp ( NCR.N ) in the market for automated teller machines, said earlier this week it would delay filing its 2007 annual report to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as it completes its accounting review. The company has not filed updated financial statements with the SEC since March 31, 2007. Since Diebold has not reported results or provided updated profit or sales projections in months, shareholders have no way of assessing the value of United Tech's offer, Lauer said. "Given that we are in the process of working to become current in our financial results, there is simply insufficient financial information for investors to assess valuation," Lauer wrote. "No responsible, objective management team or board would assert otherwise." DIEBOLD DENIES TWO-YEAR COURTSHIP North Canton, Ohio-based Diebold also took issue with United Tech's assertion that it had sought for two years to make a deal before going public with its offer on Sunday. "UTX approached Diebold on only two occasions with nonspecific inquiries," Lauer wrote, adding that one was by an investment banker who did not identify his client and the second in a "vague" February 19 letter that did not identify a specific price. Diebold is also known for its electronic voting machines, glitches of which -- including during 2004 elections in California -- have drawn widespread criticism. That business is a relatively small one for Diebold, accounting for about 4 percent of its revenue. United Tech is the world's largest maker of elevators and air conditioners. A successful acquisition of Diebold would mark its entry into the ATM business, a category that mirrors the strong growth in emerging markets in United Tech's other businesses, analysts say. United Tech's $40-per-share bid would be worth $2.64 billion based on Diebold's roughly 66 million shares as of May 7. United Tech's shares were up 42 cents to $69.32 on the  NYSE.
