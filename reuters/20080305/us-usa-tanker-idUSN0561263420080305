 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Boeing Co ( BA.N ) expects to meet the U.S. Air Force on Friday to discuss the surprise loss of a $35 billion refueling tanker contract, the chief of its defense unit said on Wednesday. 

 The U.S. No. 2 defense company has not yet decided whether to protest the award to rival Northrop Grumman Corp ( NOC.N ) and its European partner EADS ( EAD.PA ), but said its offering for the tanker contract was superior. "We offered an airplane more cost-effective and lower risk," said Jim Albaugh, the chief executive of Boeing's integrated defense systems unit, speaking at a webcast Citigroup investor conference. He said he would be able to make more comments on the matter next week, after the meeting with the Air Force, but said Boeing would only protest the award if it found an irregularity in the way the competing proposals were handled. "All we are looking for is understanding and to be treated fairly," said Albaugh, who says recent Air Force comments, and media reports on why Northrop/EADS won the contract do not match up with Boeing's understanding of the original request for proposal (RFP). "I look at what apparently was valued, and the way that we read the RFP in terms of what they (the Air Force) valued and there's a disconnect," he added. "That's why we need the debrief." U.S. Air Force procurement officials are adamant that the contest was conducted openly and fairly, but Albaugh questioned that. "If this was such a transparent acquisition, why were both the winner and loser so surprised?," he said. "You need to think about that one a little bit." Boeing's tanker proposal, based on its 767 jet, addressed the Air Force's key criteria of producing a tanker with least risk and at the lowest overall cost "better than the competition," said Albaugh. "It was never about the biggest airplane," said Albaugh, adding that Boeing had been discouraged from offering its larger 777 for the program. Some analysts have said the 777 would have been a better competitor against Airbus' A330 jet, the basis of the Northrop/EADS tanker. The cost of the Boeing program would have been less than the $35 billion which the Air Force used to describe the value of the Northrop/EADS deal, said Albaugh. The tanker deal was "a program we wanted to win," according to Albaugh, but he said revenue from the contract would only have amounted to 1 percent of Boeing's sales over the next five years.
