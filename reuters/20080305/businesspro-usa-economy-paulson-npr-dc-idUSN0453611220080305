 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The vast majority of the 8.8 million 
Americans with no equity or negative equity in their homes will 
not walk away from their properties, U.S. Treasury Secretary 
Henry Paulson said on Tuesday. 

  Paulson told National Public Radio's Marketplace program in 
an interview that he was encouraging lenders to write down 
principal on some mortgages where appropriate, but it was not 
time for the government to launch a broad mortgage bailout with 
taxpayer money.  For homeowners who walk away from their mortgage 
obligations, "the taxpayer should not be paying for your losses 
any more than they should have been paying for the losses of 
the day trader who speculated in technology stocks in 2000," 
Paulson said in a transcript made available by Marketplace.  Paulson reiterated his opposition to some proposals in 
Congress for a bigger government role in bailing out mortgages 
and supporting home prices. He said he was focused on 
private-sector mortgage modification efforts, existing 
government programs and improving refinancing prospects by 
modernizing the Federal Housing Administration and increasing 
tax-exempt bond authority for refinancing.  Asked whether Americans were more willing to walk away from 
homes that are falling in value, Paulson acknowledged that 
people who made no downpayments on their homes might be more 
willing to do so. But he added, "The vast majority of Americans 
are not going to walk away from their obligations because a 
home is more than a financial investment for them."  He said it would be doubly expensive for taxpayers to bail 
out housing speculators because the government would be 
encouraging such behavior in the future.  (Reporting by  David Lawder ; Editing by  Christian Wiessner )
