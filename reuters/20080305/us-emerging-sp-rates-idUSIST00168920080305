 ISTANBUL  (Reuters) - A long slowdown in the United States could shrink risk appetite and prompt emerging countries with high external financing needs to raise interest rates, ratings agency Standard & Poor's said on Wednesday. 

 "A protracted U.S. slowdown could reverse so far resilient risk appetite, with the consequence that central banks in those European countries with both high gross external financing needs and considerable reliance upon non-resident participation in government security markets -- in particular Hungary and Turkey -- would be forced to tighten monetary policy," the agency said in a statement.
