 BOSTON  (Reuters) - The chairman of Diebold Inc ( DBD.N ) told United Technologies Corp ( UTX.N ) in an open letter on Wednesday that by making an unsolicited $2.64 billion offer, the diversified U.S. manufacturer "is opportunistically seeking value that belongs to Diebold shareholders." 

 The letter, signed by John Lauer, nonexecutive chairman of the world's No. 2 maker of automated teller machines, noted that United Tech's $40-per-share offer is 27 percent below Diebold's 52-week high of $54.50 reached in August. (Reporting by  Scott Malone , editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
