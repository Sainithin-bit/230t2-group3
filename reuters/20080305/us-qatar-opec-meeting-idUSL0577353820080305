 DUBAI  (Reuters) - OPEC could hold an extra-ordinary meeting before June if the group saw a "strong reason", Qatar's oil minister said in remarks aired on Wednesday. 

 "I do not rule that out. There can be a meeting before June," Abdullah al-Attiyah told Al Arabiya television, adding that "there must be a reason for us to meet ... there must be a strong reason". (Reporting by  Inal Ersan ; Editing by Daliah Merzaban)
