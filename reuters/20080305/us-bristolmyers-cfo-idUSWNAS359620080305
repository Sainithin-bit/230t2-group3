 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co ( BMY.N ) said on Wednesday that Chief Financial Officer Andrew Bonfield is leaving the drug maker to seek new career opportunities. 

 Bonfield will be succeeded by Jean-Marc Huet effective March 31. Huet previously served as CFO at Royal Numico N.V. in Amsterdam. Bristol said Huet is credited with initiating and developing Numico's acquisition strategy within the baby food sector and its resulting acquisition by Groupe Danone  ( DANO.PA ).
