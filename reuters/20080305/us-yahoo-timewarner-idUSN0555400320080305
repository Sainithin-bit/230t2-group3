 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc ( YHOO.O ) and media conglomerate Time Warner Inc ( TWX.N ) have stepped up talks to create an alternative to Microsoft Corp's ( MSFT.O ) offer to take over the Web company, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday citing people familiar with the matter. 

 The paper reported that the talks center on a deal that would fold Time Warner's AOL Internet unit into Yahoo, according to the people, who still consider a Yahoo purchase by Microsoft as the most likely outcome. Last month Microsoft made a $41 billion offer to buy Yahoo, which was rejected as undervaluing the business. Yahoo and Time Warner were not immediately available for comment.
