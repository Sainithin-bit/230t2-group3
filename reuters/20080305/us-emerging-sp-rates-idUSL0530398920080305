 ISTANBUL  (Reuters) - A long slowdown in the United States could shrink risk appetite and prompt emerging countries with high external financing needs to raise interest rates, ratings agency Standard & Poor's said on Wednesday. 

 Turkey's central bank has cut rates six times in as many months, reducing the benchmark rate by 225 basis points since September to 15.25 percent. Hungary's central bank left its benchmark rate at 7.50 percent in February for the fifth consecutive month, but many analysts project a rate hike at the next meeting on March 31. Last week the central bank abandoned the forint's trading band, but after initial gains the currency and domestic government bonds remain under pressure. "A protracted U.S. slowdown could reverse so far resilient risk appetite, with the consequence that central banks in those European countries with both high gross external financing needs and considerable reliance upon non-resident participation in government security markets -- in particular Hungary and Turkey -- would be forced to tighten monetary policy," Standard & Poor's credit analyst Frank Gill said in a statement. Turkey has a huge current account deficit, which is largely financed by foreign investment. Stocks have fallen more than 20 percent this year but the lira, backed by some of the highest interest rates in emerging markets, has weakened just 3.5 percent against the dollar. Hungary is also heavily reliant on foreign financing for its current account deficit and surging mortgage loans. "The worsening growth outlook for the U.S. and the global economy will create significant challenges for capital-addicted emerging European sovereigns, particularly those with large economic imbalances such as Estonia, Iceland, and Latvia," the agency said. "The slowdown will principally affect emerging Europe via reduced capital inflows into the region," it added. (Reporting by  Emma Ross-Thomas  in Istanbul, Sandor Peto in Budapest)
