 VIENNA  (Reuters) - Nigeria's oil minister said on Wednesday he was uncomfortable with an oil price above $100 a barrel and anything above $80 was high, although he thought OPEC should keep output steady for now. 

 Nigerian Minister of State for Oil Odein Ajumogobia said the main factor pushing prices higher was the weakness of the U.S. dollar. OPEC's President Chakib Khelil said there was no problem with supply and demand.
