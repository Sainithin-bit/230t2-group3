 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Japan's Sony Corp ( 6758.T ) ( SNE.N ) said electronics sales in the United States have been solid in the first two months of the year, despite concerns about economy, a senior Sony executive said on Wednesday. 

 "We have already had a solid January and February," said Stan Glasgow, president and chief operating officer of Sony Electronics, the company's $12 billion U.S. unit, on the sidelines of a briefing with reporters in New York. He noted that the rosy returns come after a record holiday sales season for Sony Electronics, in which it gained market share for some of its products. At the briefing, Glasgow added that Sony expects about 5 million Blu-ray high definition movie players to sell globally in 2008, primarily in the U.S., including models made by other manufacturers.
