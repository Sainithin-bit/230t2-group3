 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Upscale retailers Saks Inc SKS.N and Neiman Marcus reported higher quarterly profits on Wednesday, but both companies noted sales trends had weakened recently amid a challenging environment for consumer spending. 

 Saks said sales at stores open at least a year rose 3.4 percent in February, better than the 0.2 percent drop analysts expected, according to Reuters Estimates. But the operator of Saks Fifth Avenue stores said in a statement that same-store sales in January and February had softened from the 9 percent rise it saw in the fourth quarter. "Sales increases in several of our previously high-growth rate businesses such as handbags, footwear and men's have slowed," Saks Chairman Steve Sadove said in the statement. Neiman Marcus said its same-store sales fell in February. Saks forecast that same-store sales would rise in the mid-single-digit percentage range for the year but added it expects a "modest decrease" in its gross margin rate. Earnings at Saks came to $39.5 million, or 26 cents a share, for the fourth quarter ended February 2, compared with $21.5 million, or 14 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding items that led to a gain of 7 cents a share, Saks' profit came to 19 cents a share, a penny below the 20 cents expected by analysts, according to Reuters Estimates. Saks said quarterly sales rose 4.7 percent to $999.7 million. At Neiman Marcus, profit rose to $44.3 million for the fiscal second quarter ended January 26 from $41.0 million a year earlier. It said same-store sales for its namesake and Bergdorf Goodman stores fell 7.4 percent in February, while total revenue fell 5.4 percent to $288 million in the month. Neiman said it shifted an end-of-season sale for certain stores into January from February and moved its annual beauty event into February from March.
