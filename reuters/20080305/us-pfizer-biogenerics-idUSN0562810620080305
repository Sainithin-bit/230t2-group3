 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc ( PFE.N ) sees the emerging area of generic biotechnology medicines as an "opportunity" for the world's largest drug company, Chief Executive Officer Jeff Kindler said on Wednesday. 

 Pfizer has expressed its intent to become a major player in biotech drugs, which are more complicated to manufacture than traditional pills and often more expensive. However, the interest in lower-cost generic versions of such biotech drugs would separate it from most other brand pharmaceutical makers. To date, companies that focus on generic drugs have been considered the most likely to dominate the new frontier of generic biotech. "I do think that's an opportunity for us," Kindler said in response to a question during a 5-hour meeting with industry analysts and investors in New York. U.S. regulators are weighing the creation of a pathway for generic versions of biotech drugs, which are generally derived from human proteins and therefore more complicated to duplicate than traditional chemicals. But Kindler said he expected there will be a regulatory pathway and that Pfizer was well prepared to be involved. "We're not ready to say when it will happen, but it is in the sweet spot of our capabilities," Kindler said. (Reporting by  Bill Berkrot  and  Lewis Krauskopf ; Editing by  Tim Dobbyn )
