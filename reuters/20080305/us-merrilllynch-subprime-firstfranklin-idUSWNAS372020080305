 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Merrill Lynch & Co MER.N on Wednesday said it will eliminate 650 jobs as it stops making subprime mortgages through its First Franklin Financial Corp unit. 

 New York-based Merrill said it is quitting the subprime lending business because of the deteriorating market for home loans, which go to people with poor credit. Merrill said it will try to sell Home Loan Services, a unit of First Franklin that handles billing and collections. It expects to incur $60 million of charges related to First Franklin, mainly for severance payments and offices closing. About have the amount is expected to be incurred in the first quarter. Merrill bought First Franklin and much of its loan portfolio from Cleveland-based National City Corp NCC.N for $1.3 billion in December 2006. First Franklin had employed 2,100 people as recently as last May. Dozens of mortgage lenders have closed or slashed staffing in the last year because of the U.S. housing slump. Three other Wall Street banks -- Bear Stearns Cos BSC.N, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEH.N and Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) -- have also announced deep mortgage-related job cuts since last summer. Bill Halldin, a Merrill spokesman, said most of the job cuts at San Jose, California-based First Franklin will take place this month. About 70 workers will remain thereafter, he said. Merrill plans to solicit bids for Pittsburgh-based Home Loan Services in the coming weeks. Mortgage lending in its wealth management unit, including prime mortgages offered through Merrill Lynch Credit Corp, and international mortgage operations will not be affected, Merrill said.
