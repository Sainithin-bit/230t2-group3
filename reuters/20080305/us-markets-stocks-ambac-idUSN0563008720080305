 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of Ambac Financial Group Inc fell sharply on Wednesday after they resumed trading with the bond insurer's announcement it will sell stock and equity-linked securities to help boost capital levels at its main insurance unit. 

 Traders said investors had been hoping for news of a deal to bail out Ambac instead. Ambac shares were last down 11.4 percent at $9.50, while shares of MBIA Inc, also a bond insurer, were down 6.2 percent at $12.17. (Reporting by  Caroline Valetkevitch ; Editing by  Jonathan Oatis )
