 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Philip Morris USA said on Wednesday it has asked the U.S. International Trade Commission to stop illegally imported cigarettes bearing PM USA's trademarks, including those of top selling Marlboro brand, from entering the United States. 

 The action by the unit of Altria Group Inc ( MO.N ) is aimed at Internet cigarette vendors and is the latest attempt by the company to stop illegal sales of cigarettes bearing its brands. The complaint asks the trade commission to issue a general exclusion order, which would require U.S. Customs and Border Protection to stop all imports that infringe on the company's trademarks from entering the United States, the company said.
