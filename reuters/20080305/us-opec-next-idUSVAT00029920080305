 VIENNA  (Reuters) - OPEC ministers have decided not to call a further extraordinary meeting but could confer informally at an industry conference in April, an OPEC delegate said on Wednesday. 

 The ministers will be attending energy consumers/producers talks in Rome on April 20-22 and can discuss policy then, the delegate said. OPEC's next scheduled meeting is September 9. OPEC ministers continued their meeting on Wednesday, which started shortly after 0900 GMT. They have already decided to keep oil production unchanged, OPEC delegates said.
