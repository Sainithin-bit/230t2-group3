 BERLIN  (Reuters) - A majority of private and institutional investors do not expect the U.S. credit squeeze to peak before the third quarter of this year, a survey by the Sentix research group showed on Wednesday. 

 Sentix said of 191 European institutional investors who answered its February 29-March 1 survey, 30.9 percent expected the worst to be over by the third quarter. Nearly 29 percent said an improvement would not start until the fourth quarter or later. Almost one in four thought the credit crunch would have peaked by the second quarter. Most of the rest took the view the worst already had passed or would pass in the first quarter. Sentix also polled 601 private investors, of whom just over 60 percent saw no easing in the credit turmoil until the third quarter at the earliest. A greater proportion of private than institutional investors did not expect the worst to be over until next year. Private investors were also slightly less confident that the worst was already over, or would be this quarter. (Reporting by  Dave Graham ; Editing by Ruth Pitchford)
