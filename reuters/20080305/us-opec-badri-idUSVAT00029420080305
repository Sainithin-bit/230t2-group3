 VIENNA  (Reuters) - OPEC is likely to meet again before its next scheduled meeting in September, OPEC Secretary-General Abdullah al-Badri said ahead of the group's Wednesday meeting. 

 OPEC President Chakib Khelil said on Tuesday an energy producers/consumers meeting in Rome in late April could provide an opportunity for OPEC ministers to meet.
