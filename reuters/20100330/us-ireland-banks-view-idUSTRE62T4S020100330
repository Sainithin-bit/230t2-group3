 DUBLIN  (Reuters) - Ireland on Tuesday launched its "bad bank" scheme to cleanse lenders of impaired property development loans and outlined plans to replenish their capital base. 

 Here are some reactions to the measures: IRISH BUSINESS GROUP IBEC "Today's decisive move toward purging the banking system of bad loans was a key milestone on the way to restoring international confidence in the Irish economy." UNNAMED LONDON-BASED ANALYST: "People were talking about a 30 percent haircut and now it's over 40, it shows that people didn't know how bad the assets were." "Allied Irish Banks is faring worse than expected, the higher haircut of 43 percent reflects the worse asset quality." NEW HEAD OF FINANCIAL REGULATION, MATTHEW ELDERFIELD "The banks are undergoing major surgery via NAMA to remove toxic loans from their balance sheets. Even after the surgery they will still suffer losses in the coming years, they need a transfusion now to speed their recovery and that of the economy. We have made a careful, independent judgment on that level of capital." SEBASTIAN ORSI, MERRION STOCKBROKERS "It's tough but hopefully decisive and final. We still have to see the banks achieve the capital increases that are required but at least we now know what the targets are." "It's a tough review of the capital requirements but it should give certainty over the amount of capital that's required and the ability of the banks to withstand any future losses. CENTRAL BANK GOVERNOR PATRICK HONOHAN "The way I see it is that free of the most impaired part of their portfolio and strongly capitalized, Irish banks will be able to stand on their own feet and have both the ability and the incentive to refocus on providing the necessary financial services to support the recovery of the Irish economy."
