 (Reuters) - Kraft Foods Inc KFT.N, the largest North American food maker, paid Chief Executive Irene Rosenfeld $26.3 million in total compensation last year, 41 percent more than what she received in 2008, a regulatory filing showed. 

 Rosenfeld received about $1.5 million in salary, $7.8 million in stock awards, about $1.9 million in option awards and about $4 million in annual incentive awards. She also received $10.6 million in a non-equity incentive plan, the company said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In 2008, the CEO's total compensation was valued at $18.7 million. Under Rosenfeld's leadership, Kraft reached a deal to buy Cadbury last month after a prolonged battle, creating the world's largest confectioner. The company's compensation committee determined Rosenfeld's annual incentive for 2009 taking into consideration her leadership in the combination of the two companies.
