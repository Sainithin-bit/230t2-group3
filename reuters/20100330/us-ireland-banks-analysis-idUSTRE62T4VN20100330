 LONDON  (Reuters) - Ireland is set to pump billions of euros more into lenders in an attempt to finally get to grips with its financial crisis, even as U.S. and UK governments nudge nearer to profitable exits from their bank bailouts. 

 Key terms imposed on banks from a flurry of announcements late on Tuesday were seen as harsh, but a positive aspect was that they will have time to sell assets, raise capital and limit the state's stake. Allied Irish Banks ( ALBK.I ) will sell businesses in the United States and Britain, as expected, and also its prized Polish business. Bank of Ireland ( BKIR.I ) will also raise private capital. Irish Finance Minister Brian Lenihan said Tuesday's details were "the ultimate phase of our bank rescue." The key details included an average "haircut" of 47 percent on the first tranche of assets put into a so-called "bad bank," which was higher than expected, and a target core Tier 1 capital ratio of 8 percent and an equity capital ratio of 7 percent. "It's tough, but hopefully decisive and final. We still have to see the banks achieve the capital increases that are required but at least we now know what the targets are," said Sebastian Orsi, analyst at Merrion Stockbrokers in Dublin. Ireland's stake in AIB could rise to a majority, but its holding in Bank of Ireland will stay as a minority. The state has preference shares entitling it to 25 percent of each plus a 16 percent direct holding in Bank of Ireland. "VEGETATIVE STATE" The plans should at least allow the banks to move out of what one analyst termed "a vegetative state." AIB is taking a 43 percent haircut on its first tranche and faces a capital shortfall of 7.4 billion euros. A trio of businesses could fetch about 4 billion euros ($5.4 billion) and reduce risk weighted assets, analysts estimated. AIB will sell its 24 percent stake in M&T Bank ( MTB.N ), a regional bank in the eastern United States; its UK business, which could be an attractive asset for Spain's Santander ( SAN.MC ), keen to build its UK business banking portfolio; and its profitable and fast growing Polish asset, a 70 percent interest in BZWBK BZWB.WA. "We believe there would be buyers for the three main assets for disposal: M&T in the U.S. has performed well during the crisis, the quantum of AIB UK's assets and deposits is similar to the RBS assets up for sale, and BZWBK in Poland is a highly prized growth story," analysts at Societe Generale said in a recent note. The bank has been in talks to sell a minority stake to an unnamed suitor -- reported to have been Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce ( CM.TO ) -- but having the government as a majority shareholder would likely deter any suitor, bankers said. Bank of Ireland has fewer options but also needs less capital -- estimated at 2.7 billion euros. Lenihan hopes the plan will herald a recovery, as stricken banks and sectors elsewhere are well on the mend. Britain is expected to start selling down its stakes in Lloyds ( LLOY.L ) and Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ) shortly, probably at a profit after a rally by the shares has lifted them near to the average prices paid by the government. Switzerland made a profit from selling a 9 percent stake in UBS ( UBSN.VX )( UBS.N ) last August, and on Monday the United States pledged to sell its 27 percent stake in Citigroup ( C.N ) this year, and stands to make about $7 billion. Being able to exit at a profit has proved a boon for politicians who were widely criticized for bailing out banks after years of excess by the lenders. But that day appears some way off for Ireland. Sweden may offer a more realistic case study -- it still holds a 20 percent stake in Nordea ( NDA.ST ) after it stepped in to rescue lenders in the early 1990s.
