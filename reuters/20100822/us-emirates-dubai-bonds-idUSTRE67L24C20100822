 DUBAI  (Reuters) - Dubai's government will keep its options open for a potential sovereign debt issue later this year but it is not under pressure to do so, its finance chief said late on Sunday. 

 The United Arab Emirates' member said on Friday it planned to launch a non-deal roadshow for fixed-income investors in Asia, a move analysts said hinted the emirate may issue bonds later this year as it restructures $23.5 billion in debt. "The options are open. We are not under pressure to do anything," Abdulrahman al-Saleh, director general of Dubai's Department of Finance, told Reuters on the sidelines of a gathering of Dubai officials. The planned this week's roadshow is Dubai's second in the past three months and the government said it followed its strategy for updating investors on its economy. The debt-laden Gulf emirate previously met with European fixed-income investors in June. The Asian presentations, organized by HSBC ( HSBA.L ) and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group ( 8306.T ), are scheduled to take place on August 26 in Hong Kong and on August 27 in Singapore. The Gulf Arab emirate launched a $6.5 billion bond program last October, made up of $4 billion worth of euro-denominated medium-term notes and a $2.5 billion Islamic loan. Unlike the oil-producing emirate of Abu Dhabi, Dubai has no sovereign rating, which analysts have said could make it difficult to issue debt at a reasonable price. Abu Dhabi, rated at 'Aa2' by Moody's and 'AA' by Standard & Poor's, last tapped the markets in April, 2009, selling $3 billion worth of debt. It did not budget any debt issues for 2010. Dubai government's utility DEWA DEWATF.UL got $11.5 billion in bids for its $1 billion bond in April but had to pay a generous 1.25 percent premium to the underlying sovereign. Last year, Dubai surprised global markets with a request to delay debt payments linked to its flagship conglomerate Dubai World DBWLD.UL. The government-owned firm has yet to finalize an agreement with remaining creditors after reaching a deal with a core bank group in May.
