 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Volkswagen's ( VOWG.DE ) premium car unit Audi ( NSUG.DE ) has raised its full-year vehicle sales target, a German newspaper on Sunday quoted its chief executive as saying. 

 Audi CEO Martin Winterkorn told Bild am Sonntag newspaper the firm would sell more than 900,000 vehicles this year after previously forecasting 890,000 vehicle sales. "Much of this growth is coming from outside Germany -- China, for example, where we plan to sell 250,000 cars by 2015," he told the paper. Separately, a spokesman for Audi told Reuters that the car maker was considering launching a new small car model.
