 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The average cost of a gallon of gasoline in the United States fell slightly in the past two weeks as refiners and retailers kept a check on prices during a period of lower demand, an industry analyst said on Sunday. 

 The national retail average for self-serve, regular unleaded gasoline was $2.1820 a gallon on November 3, down about 1.92 cents per gallon in the past two weeks, according to the nationwide Lundberg survey of about 6,000 gas stations. This is the lowest average retail gasoline price seen in 2006. Gasoline prices have fallen more than 84 cents per gallon after rising to an all-time Lundberg survey high of $3.0256 per gallon on August 11. Prices have fallen 24.37 cents from $2.4257 on November 4, 2005. "This 2-cents drop would not have occurred if it had not been for losses in refiner and retailer profit margins," said survey editor Trilby Lundberg. "The gasoline glut was already soaked up and crude oil prices did not decline further." Lundberg noted that crude oil prices have been stable at about $59 per barrel for several days, so any weakness in prices is based on competitive conditions. "This is a low-demand period in the gasoline market and the economy's growth is not as strong as it had been," she said. "Competition has taken a bite out of the industry's performance." At the same time, large U.S. metropolitan areas were less likely to show declines in the past two weeks and the market generally sees increased demand for heating oil during the winter months. Most price increases during the past two weeks were seen in Midwestern states, frequently the first region to log price trend changes, Lundberg said. At $2.77 a gallon, Honolulu had the highest average price for self-serve, regular gasoline, while the lowest price was $1.99 a gallon in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
