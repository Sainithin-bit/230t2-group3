 TOKYO  (Reuters) - News Corp.'s MySpace.com Internet business will be launched in Japan this month in a joint venture with Japanese Internet and telecoms group Softbank Corp., Japanese business daily Nihon Keizai reported on Monday. 

 The paper said the 50-50 venture, to be called MySpace Japan, will first offer services for personal computers and will eventually allow users to post photos and write blogs via mobile phones. The firms are expected to announce the deal as early as this week after a meeting between News Corp. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Rupert Murdoch and Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son, it said. Officials at Softbank were not immediately available for comment. News Corp. bought MySpace.com, which is popular with teenagers, last year for an estimated $580 million, and has transformed it into one of the Internet's fastest-growing properties. Such online services have also rapidly gained in popularity in Japan with Mixi Inc., Japan's most popular online social network site, quintupling its users since August of last year. Mixi debuted on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in September. A research note by UBS said in June that News Corp. and Softbank would set up a joint venture to launch MySpace.com in Japan by mid-September, citing comments by Murdoch. News Corp. declined to comment at the time.
