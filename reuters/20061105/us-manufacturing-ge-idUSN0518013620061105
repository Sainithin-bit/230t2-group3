 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Diversified manufacturer General Electric Co. ( GE.N ) is a favorite pick of major money managers, some of whom see the shares rising as much as 30 percent in the coming months, Barron's said in its November 6 edition. 

 Such investors are cheered by expectations of tame U.S. inflation, low interest rates and modest stock valuations, the financial weekly said. Web search leader Google Inc. ( GOOG.O ) and automaker General Motors Corp.( GM.N ) were named as the market's most overvalued shares in Barron's Big Money poll of major money managers.
