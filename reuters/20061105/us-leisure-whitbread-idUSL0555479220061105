 LONDON  (Reuters) - U.S. property investor Starwood Capital has acquired a stake of almost 3 percent in UK leisure conglomerate Whitbread ( WTB.L ), fuelling speculation of a possible takeover bid, The Sunday Times reported. 

 Whitbread declined to comment on the report. Barry Sternlicht, Starwood's founder and chief executive, built up the stake over the past few weeks and is just short of the 3 percent at which he would be obliged to declare his interest, the report said. Starwood was first reported to be interested in buying Whitbread in July. Recent speculation has centered on a 17 pounds-a-share bid, with Starwood and the British private-equity firm Apax Partners mentioned as possible suitors, The Sunday Times said. Whitbread's shares closed at 14.19 pounds on Friday.
