 LONDON  (Reuters) - U.S. authorities detained two former 
directors and founding shareholders of NETeller Plc NLR.L, 
the UK online money transfer firm said on Tuesday, adding it 
had requested the suspension of trading in its shares. 

  Stephen Lawrence and John Lefebvre were detained on Monday 
while traveling separately in the United States, NETeller said, 
becoming the latest victims of the U.S. crackdown on Internet 
gaming.  It said neither Lawrence nor Lefebvre had any current 
connection to the company other than as shareholders.  "The group has not received any communication or 
correspondence from any U.S. authority regarding this or any 
related matter," it said. "Pending clarification of the 
situation the board has sought immediate temporary suspension 
of NETeller's shares."  Shares in the Isle of Man-based company, which has grown 
fast with the rapid rise in online gambling, closed at 176 
pence on Monday, valuing it at around 211 million pounds 
($415.4 million).  The shares have fallen 60 percent since early September, 
hit by the arrests in the United States of executives from 
British companies involved in online sports betting and the 
passage in October of a U.S. law barring banks from 
transactions involving Internet gambling.  The passage of the U.S. law has led most operators to 
withdraw from the U.S. Internet gaming market.  "Today's news will obviously dent sector sentiment, however 
given that NETeller was the only company continuing to transact 
in the United States we think that any selloff in Playtech or 
888.com shares could offer an excellent buying opportunity," 
Numis Securities said in a note.  Shares in online gaming group 888 Plc ( 888.L ) dropped 2.9 
percent to 125 pence by 1015 GMT and gambling software maker 
Playtech ( PTEC.L ) were down 0.7 percent to 277p.  Lawrence resigned as a non-executive director of NETeller 
in October 2006, having stepped down as non-executive chairman 
in May, while Lefebvre resigned as a non-executive director in 
December 2005.  Lawrence holds a 5.91 percent stake of NETeller through his 
vehicle Corvina, while Lefebvre holds 5.54 percent of the 
company via Eagle Medallion Fortress.
