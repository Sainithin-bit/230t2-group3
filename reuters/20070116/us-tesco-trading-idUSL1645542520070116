 LONDON  (Reuters) - Tesco Plc ( TSCO.L ), Britain's biggest retailer, reported a 5.9 percent rise in underlying Christmas sales on Tuesday, beating most analysts' forecasts and most of its rivals amid strong organic food and online sales. 

 However, Finance Director Andrew Higginson struck a cautious tone on the outlook for consumer spending and urged the Bank of England not to "over-apply the medicine" after its surprise hike in interest rates earlier this month. "The consumer has been cautious for the best part of a year but has been prepared to spend up where they see value or where they want to treat themselves and they obviously decided they were going to have a good Christmas," he told Reuters. Analysts had on average forecast a 5.6 percent rise in UK like-for-like sales excluding fuel for the six weeks to January 6, with estimates ranging from 5.4 percent to 6.0 percent, according to a Reuters poll of seven brokers. Tesco said demand for fresh organic foods was particularly strong, up 39 percent in the six-week period, while sales of its premium "Finest" range rose 19 percent, including 250,000 jars of goose fat after a television cooking program tip by celebrity chef Nigella Lawson. "Really good, top of the class numbers," said Exane BNP analyst Tim Attenborough. But analysts also said the numbers were not strong enough to upgrade their full-year profit forecasts and Tesco shares -- which hit a record high of 427-1/2 pence earlier this month -- dipped to trade down 0.5 percent at 417-3/4 pence by 1050 GMT. "Such strong like-for-likes after years of excellent performance is a considerable achievement. However, the valuation is up with events," Citigroup analysts wrote. COMPETITION Tesco has trounced rivals in recent years by expanding abroad and entering new product areas such as clothes and financial services. Its share of the British grocery market is over 30 percent, almost twice that of its nearest rival. Tesco said total sales were up 9.9 percent excluding fuel in the six-week period, with international sales up 15.8 percent. It sold 7.2 million rolls of wrapping paper and 500,000 cashmere sweaters. Its top-selling toy was a Chilly and Friends Beannie and best-selling gift a 97-piece pink tool set. Britain's retailers have experienced mixed fortunes over Christmas, as debt-laden shoppers face higher interest rates and rising household bills. Supermarkets, with their cost-conscious appeal, have fared better than most. Britain's second-biggest grocer, Asda ( WMT.N ), said earlier this month it beat its own Christmas sales forecasts, without giving a figure, while Sainsbury ( SBRY.L ), the third-biggest, posted a 5 percent rise in UK like-for-like sales excluding fuel in the 12 weeks to December 30. Wm Morrison ( MRW.L ), the fourth biggest, posted a 6.3 percent rise in the six weeks to January 7. Tesco said online business Tesco.com, including pilot home-shopping business Tesco Direct, had a strong Christmas, with combined sales up over 30 percent. The firm is on track for a full launch of Tesco Direct in March or April, Higginson said. The group said price inflation in its stores was up just 0.1 percent in the six-week period, well below the national figure. Higginson brushed off speculation that an investigation by the UK's Competition Commission into supermarkets might force Tesco to sell off its land bank for new stores. "I'm absolutely confident they won't come to that conclusion. The planning process is a completely open, transparent and quasi-judicial system that exists in the UK and all competitors have equal access to that," he said. The Commission is expected to give its initial thoughts on the supermarkets within the next two weeks. Higginson also said Tesco was still looking to expand in India, after losing out in November to U.S. rival Wal-Mart in the race to set up a joint venture with Bharti Enterprises. He declined to give any details. Tesco shares have performed broadly in line with UK-listed rivals .FTASX5330 since the start of 2006. They trade at 19 times forecast earnings, according to Reuters Estimates, well below both Sainsbury and Wm Morrison on 30 and 33 respectively, both of which are recovering from previous weak performances.
