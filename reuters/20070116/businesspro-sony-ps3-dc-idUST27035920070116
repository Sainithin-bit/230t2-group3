 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's Sony Corp. ( 6758.T ) said on 
Tuesday it has shipped 1 million PlayStation 3 game consoles in 
Japan, but speculation is rising that the company would fall 
far short of its 6 million global shipment target by March. 

  Sony's game unit, Sony Computer Entertainment, said in a 
statement its global PS3 shipments reached 2 million in about 
two months after the launch, compared with its original target 
to hit the figure by the end of December.  Sony launched the new video console in Japan on November 11 
and in North America on November 17, and is locked in a battle 
with Microsoft's ( MSFT.O ) Xbox 360 and Nintendo's 7974.OS Wii 
for the top spot in the $30 billion game market's console war.  The announcement came a day after Nomura Securities cut its 
PS3 shipment forecast through March by 25 percent to 4.5 
million units, citing worse-than-expected sales.  KBC Securities analyst Hiroshi Kamide also said the 
brokerage estimates Sony selling only a little over 3 million 
units of the PS3 by March because of its high price and lack of 
game software available for the console.  "The biggest factor is the high price," he said. "It is 
hard to understand for users why they should pay that much for 
the product."  Sony's high-end PS3 retails for about $600 in the United 
States while the premium Xbox 360 sells for $400 and Nintendo 
sells the lower-tech Wii for $250. The Xbox 360 debuted in 
2005, while Nintendo launched the Wii in the U.S. on November 
19 and in Japan on December 2.  The PS3 was outsold by the Wii in Japan by the end of 
December, according to video game magazine publisher 
Enterbrain, while retail market research firm NPD has said its 
sales also lost to Nintendo's Wii in the United States in 
December.  Sony Computer Entertainment said it stuck to its target to 
ship 6 million PS3 by March.  Nomura also lowered its PS3 shipment forecast to 10 million 
units from 16 million for 2007/08 and to 11 million units from 
18 million for 2008/09.  "For home-use video game consoles, the central role of 
which in our view was usurped by handheld game machine Nintendo 
DS, we think the absence of a dominant product will lead to a 
protracted struggle," Nomura analyst Yuta Sakurai said in a 
report to clients.  "For the time being, we think Wii will remain on the 
ascendancy, supported by a lineup of attractive software titles 
and a broad user base," he said.  Before the announcement, shares in Sony closed down 0.2 
percent at 5,690 yen. The benchmark Nikkei average  .N225  
ended down 0.04 percent.
