 BERLIN  (Reuters) - Russia's decision to halt a tenth of Europe's oil supplies due to a dispute with Belarus will only add to Moscow's already poor reputation in the West, which sees Russia as an unreliable and unpredictable partner. 

 Russia, the world's second largest oil exporter, has halted the flow of crude through the Druzhba pipeline, cutting supplies to Poland, Germany and several central European countries. Moscow said Belarus was illegally siphoning off oil from the pipeline, which supplies around 10 percent of the EU's oil. The Russian move could hardly have come at a more awkward time for new European Union president Germany, which has been lobbying the other 26 members of the European Union to forge closer energy relations with Moscow. "The mood in (European) society is very confrontational toward Russia," said Alexander Rahr, a Russian expert at the German Council on Foreign Relations. "There's a mistrust of Russia that is a century old ... It's getting worse." Fears about Russia's reliability as a provider of energy deepened a year ago when Russian gas giant Gazprom ( GAZP.MM ) cut gas deliveries to Ukraine due to a price dispute. Some analysts viewed Gazprom's move as an attempt by Moscow to show how natural gas can be used as a political weapon to punish countries that become too friendly with the West. Adding to the West's mistrust of President Vladimir Putin's Russia were the murders of Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya and former KGB agent and Kremlin critic Alexander Litvinenko. "People in the West assume the government was behind this. It shows how bad Russia's image has become," said Rahr. Belarus said on Wednesday it had reached an agreement with Moscow and analysts also expect the dispute to be quickly resolved. However, analysts said it showed the need for the EU to look elsewhere for back-up energy supplies. "It does show the need to invest in alternative energy supplies that don't come from Russia," said Katinka Barysch, chief economist at the Center for European Reform in London. GERMANY WANTS CLOSER TIES WITH RUSSIA Although German Chancellor Angela Merkel described shutting down the pipeline as "unacceptable", German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier reaffirmed Berlin's plan to use its 6-month EU presidency to deepen EU energy ties with Russia. "Germany will work toward a further intensification of Europe's energy dialogue with Russia," he said. Deepening ties with Russia will not be easy. Even if the dispute between Belarus and Russia is resolved soon, Europe's relations with Moscow will likely remain strained, analysts say. There is still no resolution of Russia's dispute with Poland over its ban on Polish meat imports. Warsaw, in response, has prevented Brussels from beginning negotiations with Moscow on a new EU Partnership and Cooperation Agreement. Rahr said much of the Western press coverage of the oil dispute was unfair and demonised Russia. He said many people lost sight of the fact that Belarus was "blackmailing" Moscow. However, Rahr and Barysch both criticised the Russian government for its heavy-handed policies that are scaring away investors and increasing mistrust of Russia in the EU. "Russia pours oil into the fire by behaving in the way the West expects and without explaining its actions," Rahr said. If the EU decides to find alternative avenues for oil and gas deliveries, it has options like Norway. But other options -- more Middle East oil via Turkey or from problematic North African countries like Libya or Algeria -- would be fraught with political problems. Ultimately analysts said Russia would probably try to avoid alienating the EU, which is too important an energy customer. Russia, they said, has more to lose than the EU in the end. "It's not really in Russia's interest to be seen as unreliable," said Charles Esser of the Brussels-based International Crisis Group. "They want the revenues."
