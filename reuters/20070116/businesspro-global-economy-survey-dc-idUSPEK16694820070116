 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Asia again topped a survey which 
ranks the world's freest economies in 2007, with Hong Kong in 
first place and Singapore in second position. 

  Australia clinched the third spot in the latest Index of 
Economic Freedom survey for 2007 conducted by the Wall Street 
Journal and The Heritage Foundation.  Hong Kong topped the rankings for the 13th consecutive year 
with an 89.3 score out of 100 given its low taxes and highly 
flexible labor market. Singapore came second with a score of 
85.7, while Australia jumped from ninth to third in a new 
ranking methodology which included labor freedoms for the first 
time.  Europe had four countries in the top 10 including the UK, 
Ireland, Luxembourg and Switzerland. The United States came 
fourth.  The 2007 index showed that for the 157 countries rated, 
overall global economic freedom "stalled" slightly this year, 
after a sustained uptrend, with a 0.3 percent dip from the 
previous year's average.  The worst ranked country was North Korea with three points.  The rankings employed criteria such as business freedom, 
tax rates, inflation, property rights and freedom from 
corruption.  For Hong Kong, the recent scrapping of a proposed goods and 
services tax was seen as positive, but a possible move to enact 
minimum wage laws could hurt the city's economic freedom by 
creating more unemployment, the report's editors said.  Singapore could have eclipsed Hong Kong were it not for 
heavy state influence in the banking sector, with a relatively 
low financial freedom score, they said.  A recent debate spurred by Hong Kong chief executive Donald 
Tsang's apparent dropping of the city's long-standing 
"laissez-faire" policy of positive non-interventionism was not 
considered a negative.  "We look at what's actually done, rather than what he 
says," said Mary Kissel, the editorial pages editor of the Wall 
Street Journal in Asia, who introduced the 2007 results.
  LABOR FREEDOM  A revised ranking methodology which included criterion like 
labor freedom for the first time, allowed Australia to move up 
to third this year from ninth spot, leap-frogging the likes of 
Ireland and the United States.  But Asia's economic goliath China was ranked a lowly 119, 
behind countries such as Lesotho and Cameroon, given its lack 
of property rights and financial and investment freedom.  "It's well known internationally that the court system, the 
judicial system in China is not up to world standards," said 
Edwin Feulner, President of the Heritage Foundation. "This is 
an area that clearly, the right kind of leadership in China 
could make for a dramatic increase in economic freedom."  Of the 157 countries ranked, only seven were classified as 
"free" with a score of 80 or higher.  Twenty countries, including many in Asia like Vietnam, Laos 
and Myanmar had "repressed" economies with scores of less than 
50.  Despite this, the authors said global poverty was found to 
be retreating as a result of international economic growth.
