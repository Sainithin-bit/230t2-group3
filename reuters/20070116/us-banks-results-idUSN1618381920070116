 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co. ( WFC.N ) and U.S. Bancorp ( USB.N ), the fifth- and sixth-largest U.S. banks, on Tuesday reported higher quarterly profits, helped by growth in business lending and fee-generating units. 

 Profit rose 13 percent at Wells Fargo to $2.18 billion, or 64 cents per share, from $1.93 billion, or 57 cents per share, a year earlier, matching the average analyst forecast, according to Reuters Estimates. U.S. Bancorp said profit rose 4 percent to $1.19 billion, or 66 cents per share, from $1.14 billion, or 62 cents per share. Profit fell a penny per share below the average analyst forecast. Both banks operate mainly in the western two-thirds of the United States. They have boosted their reliance on lending to small and mid-sized businesses after 17 Federal Reserve interest-rate increases have slowed consumer borrowing growth. Wells Fargo has close to 3,200 branches, and U.S. Bancorp has 2,472. "Growth is supported by the Western markets they serve, where commercial growth has been strong," said Gerard Cassidy, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. "However, there is a clear trend of credit quality deterioration compared with the third quarter." In afternoon trading, Wells Fargo shares rose 74 cents to $36.25, while U.S. Bancorp shares rose 20 cents to $35.75. Other large banks are scheduled to report results in the next week, including JPMorgan Chase & Co. ( JPM.N ) on Wednesday, Citigroup Inc. ( C.N ) on Friday and Bank of America Corp. ( BAC.N ) and Wachovia Corp. WB.N next Tuesday. WELLS FARGO San Francisco-based Wells Fargo said revenue rose 11 percent to $9.41 billion, topping forecasts for $9 billion. Compared with the third quarter, average loans and core low-cost deposits rose an annualized 11 percent and net interest margin rose to 4.93 percent from 4.79 percent. Profit rose 9 percent in retail banking, 14 percent in business banking and 64 percent at Wells Fargo Financial, which lends to less credit-worthy people. Wells Fargo has been expanding in subprime lending while many rivals contract. The bank said it sold an average 5.2 products to each retail customer and six products to each business customer, up from about three each when Norwest Corp. merged with Wells Fargo in 1998. "The consumer sector and commercial sector are in good shape," Chief Financial Officer Howard Atkins said in an interview. "There are always commercial customers who have demand for inventory financing and capital expenditures. People are (also) still out there buying homes, spending money and consolidating debt." Wells Fargo set aside $726 million for credit losses, up 9 percent from the third quarter. Separately, it sold its Latin American consumer finance unit to a Bear Stearns Cos. BSC.N private equity arm for an undisclosed price. US BANCORP, OTHERS Minneapolis-based U.S. Bancorp said net revenue rose 3 percent to $3.42 billion, though expenses rose 10 percent. Acquisitions helped fuel a 12 percent increase in fee income, including gains of 26 percent in merchant processing services and 24 percent in trust and investment management. This more than offset a 5 percent drop in lending income and 77 percent drop in mortgage banking revenue. Credit losses rose 25 percent from the third quarter to $169 million, and nonperforming assets edged up 2 percent. Net interest margin held steady at 3.56 percent. Results were the first reported by Chief Executive Richard Davis, promoted last month to replace Jerry Grundhofer, who remains chairman. Davis said nonperforming asset levels should stay "fairly stable" despite "stress" from consumer borrowers in the Midwest . Among other banks to report, Milwaukee-based Marshall & Ilsley Corp. MI.N said quarterly profit rose 16 percent to $205.4 million, or 79 cents per share. Cherry Hill, New Jersey-based Commerce Bancorp Inc. CBH.N said profit rose 68 percent to $78.7 million, or 40 cents per share.
