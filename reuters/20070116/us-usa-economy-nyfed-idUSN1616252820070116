 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Manufacturing in New York state slowed more than expected in January to the lowest since mid-2005, the New York Federal Reserve said on Tuesday. 

 The New York Fed's "Empire State" general factory conditions index fell to 9.13 from a downwardly revised 22.19 in December. December's reading was originally reported at 23.13. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a January reading of 20.00. January's level was the lowest since June 2005, when the index bounced up to 8.94 from May 2005's minus 7.10, according to revised figures. Michael Englund, chief economist at Action Economics in Boulder, Colorado, said the Empire index appeared to be playing catch-up with similar economic gauges but could also weigh on the Institute for Supply Management's next reading on nationwide manufacturing. "Generally, the Empire survey has been running higher than the other sentiment indices like the Philly Fed. Now, it's correcting toward the other indices," said Englund. "After this reading, we are expecting a 51.5 figure for the ISM in January, but it may signal some downside risk. It looks like a general decline on the major components but still running at a relatively solid level." The new orders component fell to 10.26 in January from a downwardly revised 22.52. It was originally reported at 25.12 for December. The prices paid component rose to 35.11 from 28.09 in December. The report's unfilled orders component firmed slightly to minus 8.51 in January from a downwardly revised minus 14.61 in December. The survey of manufacturing plants in the state is one of the earliest monthly guideposts to U.S. factory conditions.
