 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - BP Chief Executive John Browne, who announced last week he is retiring this summer, said he understands there were serious safety problems at the company's oil refineries in the United States. 

 "BP gets it, and I get it too," Browne said. An independent investigative panel, formed in the wake of a fatal explosion at BP's Texas City refinery in 2005, said Tuesday there were safety problems at all of the British oil major's U.S. plants. "This has happened on my watch, and as chief executive I have the responsibility to learn from what has happened," Browne said at a news conference in response to the panel's findings. BP said it will adopt the panel's recommendations for overhauling safety measures at its refineries. BP has been beset by several other problems at its U.S. operations since 2005, including oil spills in Alaska and accusations of market manipulation. Browne announced last week he will step down at the end of July, 17 months earlier than planned. He will be succeeded by Tony Hayward, the company's head of exploration and production. Browne said his departure had nothing to do with the company's problems or the timing of the panel's findings.
