 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Intel Corp. ( INTC.O ) on Tuesday posted a lower quarterly profit but a raft of new high-end processors from the top chipmaker drove average selling prices higher. 

 Intel, which supplies processors for about three-quarters of the world's personal computers, also said it expected sales for the first quarter to be between $8.7 billion and $9.3 billion, compared to the average Wall Street forecast of $8.93 billion.  COMMENTARY: JOANNE FEENEY, ANALYST, FTN MIDWEST SECURITIES "Revenue came in higher than we expected but operating income came in lower than we expected on a lower revenue base... "It indicates to us the competitive pressures with AMD were more severe than we had thought and that Intel continues to struggle to regain its market share." JANE SNOREK, TECHNOLOGY ANALYST, FIRST AMERICAN FUNDS IN  MILWAUKEE: "I think the stock is probably not going up because of the headline about gross margin being up 50 percent. Intel turns on its gross margin and if Intel is saying they don't expect any gross margin increase this year, that's a disappointment." MIKE BINGER, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, THRIVENT FINANCIAL,  MINNEAPOLIS "The bottom line is that revenue was a little better, gross margin was kind of in-line to slightly below in-line and earnings was in-line, too. And then they gave guidance for the first quarter, which was OK... To really get this thing moving people want to see slight upside to gross margin, and instead they're seeing in line gross margin." CODY ACREE, ANALYST, STIFEL NICOLAUS "The numbers looked pretty good for the December quarter... The guidance is where things are a little mixed. Their gross margin outlook at least in the press release looks to be a little soft to what most would have expected."
