 LONDON  (Reuters) - Oil giant BP Plc ( BP.L ) said on Tuesday 
it would implement recommendations made by an independent panel 
headed by former U.S. Secretary of State James Baker that 
identified material deficiencies in safety at BP's U.S. 
refineries. 

  "We asked for a candid assessment from this diverse group 
of experts and they delivered one," BP Chief Executive John 
Browne said.  BP added it had already taken actions which were in line 
with the panel's recommendations.  Fifteen workers were killed by an explosion at BP's Texas 
City refinery in 2005. Safety regulators placed the blame 
partly on BP's culture of managing costs aggressively.
