  (Adds 2007 forecasts, Samsung SDI result) 

  By Rhee So-eui and Marie-France Han SEOUL  Jan 16 (Reuters) - South Korean flat screen maker
LG.Philips LCD Co. Ltd. ( 034220.KS ) reported on Tuesday a third
straight quarterly loss as weak panel prices and lingering cost
problems outweighed seasonally strong demand.  A full recovery appears remote as LG.Philips ( LPL.N ) is set
to see losses widen in the seasonally slower first quarter of
2007, with the company forecasting panel prices falling sharply
this year.  "LCD sales are starting to drop again and we expect
LG.Philips to record bigger losses in the first and second
quarters," said Jeon Woo-jong, an analyst for SK Securities.  "LG.Philips decided to cut its budget for infrastructure
building and raw materials. This may benefit the company in the
short run, but considering its competitors, this might be a
problem. The main focus now is how well the new CEO's
strategies will work."  The world's No.2 maker of large liquid crystal display
(LCD) panels replaced its chief executive and other top
managers in December in a move aimed at focusing on profits.  The company posted a 174 billion won ($186 million) net
loss in the quarter ended in December, in line with a 180.5
billion won shortfall forecast by Reuters Estimates.  The fourth-quarter loss marks a sharp contrast with a 328
billion won net profit a year earlier, although it improved
from the previous quarter's 321 billion won shortfall.  Sales on a consolidated basis came in at 3.07 trillion won,
against 2.96 trillion a year earlier and in line with a 3.1
trillion forecast.  For more earnings details, see the company's Web site at:

which competes with home rival Samsung Electronics Co.
( 005930.KS ) and Taiwan's AU Optronics Corp. ( 2409.TW ), has
struggled with heavy costs and the slow ramp-up of its TV panel
line introduced at the beginning of 2006.  The company said it would cut costs by 25 to 30 percent in
2007 to offset falling panel prices. In November, it said it
would expand outsourcing and find cheaper overseas suppliers
for components such as polarisers and back-light units.  It maintained its previously announced capital expenditure
plan for this year at around 1 trillion won, down sharply from
2.83 trillion in 2006.  TOUGH QUARTER AHEAD  By its own projections, LG.Philips, jointly set up by LG
Electronics Inc. ( 066570.KS ) and Dutch peer Philips Electronics
( PHG.AS ), is likely to remain in the red for the coming months.  The company said it expected panel shipments to fall by a
"mid-single-digit percent" in the first quarter from the
fourth, while selling prices would fall by "low teens percent"
in the same period, widening from a 1 percent fall in
October-December.  It expected its margin on earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) at a percentage in the
mid-teens in the first quarter, against 18 percent in the
fourth.  Still, analysts believe LG.Philips would turn its fortunes
around later this year.  "The first quarter will be tough, but we could see signs of
improvement as early as the second quarter and more stable
prices by the third quarter," said Chung Kyun-sik, chief
investment officer at Yuris Asset Management.  For 2007, LG.Philips is expected to post a net profit of
258 billion won, according to Reuters Estimate, against a 769
billion won loss for 2006.  Also on Tuesday, Samsung SDI Co. ( 006400.KS ), the world's
third-largest plasma display panel (PDP) maker, reported it
swung to a 32.3 billion won net loss in the fourth quarter,
against an 82.2 billion profit a year ago, due to stiff
competition and falling panel prices.  Samsung SDI also faces a tough first half as it starts up a
production line for a new generation of screen display
technology with low initial yields.  Before the earnings announcement, shares in LG.Philips,
valued at about $11 billion, rose 1.04 percent to close at
29,200 won, against the wider market's  .KS11  0.09 percent
fall.  The stock fell 11 percent in the fourth quarter, lagging
KOSPI's 4.6 percent gain.
