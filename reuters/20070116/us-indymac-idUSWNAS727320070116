 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - IndyMac Bancorp Inc. NDE.N, one of the largest U.S. savings and loans, on Tuesday said fourth-quarter profit will be "substantially below" its forecast, citing difficulties in the mortgage and housing industries. 

 The Pasadena, California-based company expects earnings of about 97 cents per share. It had previously expected profit of about $1.35 per share, with a range of $1.30 to $1.40. Analysts polled by Reuters Estimates on average projected fourth-quarter profit of $1.33 per share.
