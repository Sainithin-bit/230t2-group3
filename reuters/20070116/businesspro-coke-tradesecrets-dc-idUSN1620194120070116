 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Jury selection began on Tuesday in the 
federal case of a former Coca-Cola Co. ( KO.N ) aide charged with 
conspiring to steal trade secrets of the beverage giant and 
trying to sell them to rival PepsiCo Inc. ( PEP.N ) 

  Nearly 100 prospective jurors were given questionnaires in 
the case of Joya Williams, said a court reporter for U.S. 
District Judge J. Owen Forrester, who is presiding over the 
Atlanta trial.  Williams, who was an administrative assistant to the 
director of global brands at Coca-Cola, faces up to 10 years in 
prison if convicted. She has pleaded not guilty.  Two other defendants, Ibrahim Dimson of New York and Edmund 
Duhaney of Decatur, Georgia, pleaded guilty in October, and one 
is expected to testify against Williams.  The three were indicted in July 2006.  Williams "did not agree with the co-defendants to do 
anything," said Janice Singer, her lawyer. "We are absolutely 
denying that she gave the documents to the co-defendants or 
knew that they were trying to sell them to Pepsi."  Documents filed in the case indicate that Pepsi, based in 
Purchase, New York, provided a copy of a letter to Coca-Cola in 
May 2006 from a person claiming to be a high-level employee 
offering confidential information. Atlanta-based Coca-Cola 
contacted the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which began an 
undercover inquiry.  Federal prosecutors say phone records and further 
investigation showed that Williams was the alleged source of 
the information that was to be sold.
