 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Manufacturing activity in New York 
State factories slowed more than expected in January to its 
lowest since mid-2005, the New York Federal Reserve said on 
Tuesday. 

  The New York Fed's "Empire State" general factory 
conditions index fell to 9.13 from a downwardly revised 22.19 
in December. December's reading was originally reported at 
23.13. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a January 
reading of 20.00.  Michael Englund, chief economist at Action Economics in 
Boulder, Colorado, said the Empire index appeared to be playing 
catch-up with similar economic gauges but could also weigh on 
the Institute for Supply Management's next reading on 
nation-wide manufacturing.  "Generally, the Empire survey has been running higher than 
the other sentiment indices like the Philly Fed. Now, it's 
correcting toward the other indices," said Englund.  "After this reading, we are expecting a 51.5 figure for the 
ISM in January, but it may signal some downside risk. It looks 
like a general decline on the major components but still 
running at a relatively solid level."  The new orders component fell to 10.26 in January from a 
downwardly revised 22.52. It was originally reported at 25.12 
for December. The prices paid component rose to 35.11 from 
28.09 in December.  The report's unfilled orders component firmed slightly to 
minus-8.51 in January from a downwardly revised minus-14.61 in 
December.  The survey of manufacturing plants in the state is one of 
the earliest monthly guideposts to U.S. factory conditions.
