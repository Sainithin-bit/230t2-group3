 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. agribusiness giant Cargill Inc. on Tuesday said quarterly net income rose, helped by strength in its risk management and financial segment and its origination and processing segment. 

 Minneapolis-based Cargill, a private company that provides food, agricultural and trading services, said net earnings for the fiscal second quarter that ended November 30, rose 34 percent to $662 million, from $495 million a year earlier. Cargill said its food ingredients and applications areas posted a modest increase from a year ago, with the strongest results coming from North American-based business units. Agriculture services did not keep pace with last year's performance, the company said.
