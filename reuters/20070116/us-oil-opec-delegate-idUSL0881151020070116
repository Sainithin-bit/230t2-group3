 DUBAI  (Reuters) - OPEC producers, concerned about a steep drop in oil prices, are discussing further action to stabilize markets and may call for an emergency meeting, officials said on Monday. 

 The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed last month to cut oil output by 500,000 barrels per day from February 1, adding to a 1.2 million bpd reduction from November. But oil prices fell nearly 8 percent last week to below $56 a barrel, pressured by mild weather and rising fuel stockpiles. "The fast and deep drop in the oil market in the last week is worrying oil producers," a senior OPEC delegate told Reuters. "There are consultations and discussions among some OPEC ministers," he said. "Consultations are on different opinions about the market, making sure there is strong implementation and commitment to supply cuts and discussing different ideas about further action if there is a need for it." Price hawk Venezuela went a step further, calling for an emergency session ahead of the group's scheduled March 15 gathering in Vienna. "We are in constant dialogue with other ministers and we are evaluating the possibility of some kind of extraordinary meeting," Oil Minister Rafael Ramirez said. Oil resumed its slide on Monday, having earlier risen as Russian crude supplies were halted through a pipeline that meets a fifth of demand from Germany. U.S. crude was trading at $55.85, down 45 cents at 1609 GMT. Some OPEC officials have reacted warily to the retreat in oil prices. Nigeria's top oil official Edmund Daukoru said on Friday OPEC should wait to see the impact of supply curbs already agreed before making any further reduction. And Iran's OPEC Governor Hossein Kazempour Ardebili said cuts already agreed should keep markets balanced until OPEC meets next on March 15, but added that the group may have to consider meeting before then if the weak price trend continues. OPEC READY TO ACT OPEC is widely believed to be defending an undeclared target of $60 a barrel for U.S. crude and Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter, is thought to want prices between $55-$65. "Basically, there is every reason to believe that the oil market will firm up and OPEC is willing to do whatever is necessary to keep the market stable," the OPEC delegate said. "Saudi Arabia is among other countries that are open to all possibilities according to consultations with other OPEC member states and developments in the market." Leading OPEC producer Saudi Arabia will cut oil output by 158,000 bpd from February in line with OPEC's latest production cut, a Saudi source told Reuters on Monday. The source confirmed that the kingdom's total cut would equal 538,000 bpd -- a 158,000 bpd reduction from February 1 in addition to a 380,000 bpd cut from last November. That would take Saudi Arabia's output to around 8.5 million bpd. A Reuters survey showed that OPEC made little further progress in December in lowering supply, as higher output from some members offset continuing cutbacks by Saudi Arabia and others. "We within OPEC believe the majority, if not all members, are honouring their cut," the delegate said.
