 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - An independent panel on Tuesday recommended that British oil major BP Plc. overhaul safety procedures at all five of its U.S. refineries after finding dangerous conditions at the plants. 

 The panel, headed by former U.S. Secretary of State James Baker, was convened after an explosion at BP's Texas City refinery killed 15 workers and injured 170 on March 23, 2005, in the worst U.S. industrial accident in 10 years. Baker said implementing the panel's recommendations to improve safety at the plants would take years and require "a substantial amount of capital." BP, beset by a string of problems at its U.S. operations over the past two years including oil spills in Alaska and accusations of market manipulation, said it would adopt the recommendations. "BP gets it, and I get it too," said outgoing BP Chief Executive John Browne at a news conference following the release of the panel's report. The investigation found a significant safety culture breakdown existed throughout BP's U.S. refining network as the company emphasized personal safety but neglected process safety risks that could result in major accidents. "Instances of a lack of operating disciplines, toleration of serious deviations from safe operating practices, and apparent complacency toward serious process safety risks existed at each of the U.S. refineries," the panel said. The report said BP, one of the world's biggest oil companies, needs to strengthen management accountability and create a new system to identify and manage safety risks. In addition, BP should engage an independent monitor to report annually to the board of directors on the implementation of the recommendations for five years, the panel said. Browne, who announced last week that he would leaving the company this summer, said the company was doing everything possible to prevent another major accident. BP executives will meet with panel members in the next week to discuss implementing the recommendations, he added. INDUSTRY PROBLEMS The Baker report said the safety problems are not unique to BP and added other refiners operating in the world's biggest oil consumer could benefit from the findings. "If other refining and chemical companies consider our recommendations and apply them, we believe that those workplaces will be safer and that future tragedies like the Texas City accident can be avoided." Browne created the panel -- which includes academics, a retired U.S. Navy admiral, and a United Steelworkers union representative -- in October 2005 on the recommendation of the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (CSB). The CSB has said it hopes the report will reverberate throughout the industry. "Corporate leadership at the highest level is accountable for the safe operation of facilities that use hazardous chemicals. Safety culture is created at the top, and when it fails there, it fails workers far down the line. That is what happened at BP," said CSB Chairwoman Carolyn Merritt. Citibank said the report may not have been as bad as some had expected. "While there is still a financial impact from reduced Texas City operations, sentiment may have bottomed out," Citibank said in a research note. Shares in the world's third-largest western oil company by market capitalization were down 1.5 percent after the report.
