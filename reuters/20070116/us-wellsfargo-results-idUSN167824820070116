 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co. ( WFC.N ), the No. 5 U.S. bank, said on Tuesday fourth-quarter profit rose 13 percent, helped by growth in business lending, low-cost deposits and subprime mortgages. 

 Net income for the San Francisco-based company increased to $2.18 billion, or 64 cents per share, from $1.93 billion, or 57 cents, a year earlier. Profit matched the average analyst forecast, according to Reuters Estimates. Wells Fargo shares rose more than 1 percent in morning trading. Revenue rose 11 percent to $9.41 billion, topping forecasts for $9 billion, and expenses rose 11 percent to $5.41 billion. Compared with third quarter, average loans and core low-cost deposits rose an annualized 11 percent, and net interest margin rose to 4.93 percent from 4.79 percent. Customers also bought more products. The bank said it sold an average of 5.2 products to each retail customer and 6 products to each business customer, up from about three each when Norwest Corp. merged with Wells Fargo in 1998. "They are redoubling efforts to increase activity with existing customers," said Thomas Russo, who helps invest more than $3 billion at Gardner Russo & Gardner in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, including about $120 million in Wells Fargo. "Credit controls are also strong, and their avoidance of risky practices helped them avoid the chaos in the subprime market." In morning trading, Wells Fargo shares rose 56 cents to $36.07 on the New York Stock Exchange. MORTGAGES Profit rose 9 percent to $1.51 billion from retail banking, 14 percent to $508 million from wholesale business banking, and 64 percent to $161 million at Wells Fargo Financial, which lends to less creditworthy people. "The consumer sector and commercial sector are in good shape," Chief Financial Officer Howard Atkins said in an interview. "Given economic growth, there are always commercial customers who have demand for inventory financing and capital expenditures. People are (also) still out there buying homes, spending money and consolidating debt." Wells Fargo is increasing its subprime home lending business even as many competitors cut back because delinquencies are mounting and intensifying competition is driving down margins. The bank was the largest U.S. subprime lender in the third quarter, according to National Mortgage News. It is the No. 2 overall mortgage lender, after Countrywide Financial Corp.  CFC.N. Atkins, though, said Wells Fargo won't make some higher-risk loans, including "pay option" loans that let customers pay less than the amount due each month. "As long as the customer has the wherewithal to pay, and we're getting an appropriate return, there's nothing wrong with the business," he said. IndyMac Bancorp Inc. NDE.N, a Pasadena, California thrift and mortgage specialist that does make pay option loans, said fourth-quarter profit will be "substantially" below its prior forecast, citing deteriorating mortgage market conditions. Separately, Wells Fargo sold its Latin American consumer finance unit to a Bear Stearns Cos. BSC.N private equity arm for an undisclosed price. CORE DEPOSITS RISE Fee income from mortgages rose 8 percent to $677 million. Applications rose 1 percent to $90 billion, and unclosed mortgages as of December 31 fell 4 percent to $48 billion. New mortgages fell 23 percent $87 billion. Net credit losses rose 3 percent to $726 million, and increased 36 percent excluding the year-earlier impact of bankruptcy law changes. Loans rose 3 percent to $319.1 billion, core deposits rose 7 percent to $270.2 billion, and assets were little changed at $482 billion. Billionaire Warren Buffett's holding company, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. ( BRKa.N ) ( BRKb.N ), is Wells Fargo's largest investor, owning 5.65 percent of its shares as of September 30, according to Thomson ShareWatch.
