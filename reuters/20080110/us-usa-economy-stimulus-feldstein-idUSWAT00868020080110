 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The probability of the U.S. economy sliding into a recession is now over 50 percent, but it is not a sure thing, National Bureau of Economic Research President Martin Feldstein said on Thursday. 

 "A recession in my judgment is more likely than not, but it's not a sure thing," Feldstein told a forum hosted by the Hamilton Project, an economic research group headed by former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin. NBER is the organization that determines when the business cycle enters recessions and recoveries. (Reporting by  David Lawder ; Editing by Tom Hals)
