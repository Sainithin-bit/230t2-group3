 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Discount retailer Target Corp ( TGT.N ) on Thursday said December sales at stores open at least a year rose 0.6 percent, adjusted for a calendar shift, above Wall Street's expectation for a gain of 0.2 percent. 

 But not taking into account the calendar shift, the company said same-store sales fell 5 percent in December, compared with Wall Street's forecast for a 4.9 percent decline, according to Reuters Estimates. Target also said traffic to its stores fell during the holiday-heavy December shopping month, and earnings per share for the fourth quarter, which began on November 4, "will not meet last year's performance." For January, the company forecast same-store sales in the range of down 1 percent to up 1 percent, compared with a rise of 5.1 percent in the year-earlier period. Shares fell 2.3 percent to $48.76 in premarket trading. Last month, Target lowered its December sales forecast, saying it expected same-store sales in the range of down 1 percent to up 1 percent, adjusted for the calendar shift. It had originally forecast a rise of 3 percent to 5 percent on an adjusted basis. Sales for the five weeks ended January 5 increased 0.1 percent to $9.26 billion from $9.25 billion a year earlier. Target said sales were strongest in shoes, health care and consumable items, while jewelry, toys and housewares were the weakest categories. (Reporting by  Nicole Maestri , editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
