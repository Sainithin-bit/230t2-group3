 LONDON  (Reuters) - Northern Rock's NRK.L 180,000 investors next week face a choice between keeping a say in the future of the troubled British bank or hampering the chance of a rescue at a critical time. 

 At least those are the two stark options according to its two biggest shareholders on one side, and the bank's management on the other. An extraordinary general meeting, scheduled for Tuesday, represents the highest-profile stage for shareholders to voice their anger, frustration or support for Britain's fifth-biggest mortgage lender since it was engulfed in crisis four months ago. The EGM is due to be held in Northern Rock's northeast England home town of Newcastle in a 10,500-seat arena, starting at 1000 GMT. The large venue was chosen for an expected high turnout from the thousands of Britons with small shareholdings since the bank floated a decade ago, who could swing the vote. Retail investors own about a quarter of the shares in issue. But all the bank's shareholders are in an uncertain position. The government has lent about 27 billion pounds ($52.8 billion) to Northern Rock and has made clear that protecting depositors and taxpayers are its priorities and shareholders are lower down the pecking order as it tries to find a buyer. Investment firms Virgin and Olivant are in talks to rescue Northern Rock, but tough credit markets have sparked concerns they may struggle to raise the funds and the government could be forced to nationalize the bank -- potentially leaving shareholders with nothing. REBEL YELL The two hedge funds who called for the vote, SRM Global and RAB Capital, want investors to be asked for approval for the board to sell assets or issue significant new shares. SRM and RAB, who together own 18 percent of Northern Rock's shares, said reasons for calling the vote included the threat a hasty deal would destroy value and because politics was overshadowing the interests of shareholders. But Northern Rock's board has said the meeting is "potentially damaging" and urged shareholders to oppose the resolutions, saying they would "materially restrict the power of the board to act at a time when prompt, decisive action may be required". Northern Rock is Britain's highest profile casualty of the credit crunch. It was forced to seek emergency funding from the Bank of England in mid-September, prompting the first run on the deposits of a major British bank for over 140 years. The resolution to require further shareholder approval before significant new shares can be issued requires a majority vote, while three resolutions on buying or selling assets or changing the structure require 75 percent support. Swedish fund AP2 will vote its 1.8 percent stake in favor of the proposals, according to UK newspaper reports, and the UK Shareholders Association, which represents private investors, also backs them.
