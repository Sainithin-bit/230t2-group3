 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Ross Stores Inc. ( ROST.O ) said on Thursday that sales at stores open at least a year rose 3 percent in December, as purchases of outerwear, dresses and shoes helped lift sales and gross margin above company expectations. 

 Analysts, on average, had been expecting the off-price retailer to post a rise of 0.8 percent, according to Reuters Estimates. Total sales rose 12 percent during the five weeks ended January 5 to $755 million, said the company, which buys excess merchandise in bulk from manufacturers below wholesale prices.
