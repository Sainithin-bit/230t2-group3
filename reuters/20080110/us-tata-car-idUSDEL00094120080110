 NEW DELHI  (Reuters) - India's Tata Motors Ltd ( TAMO.BO ) ( TTM.N ) unveiled the world's cheapest car on Thursday, bringing car ownership closer to millions of consumers in emerging markets. 

 The 4-seater Nano, with an engine around 625 cc, will have a dealer price of 100,000 rupees ($2,500), and will go on sale later this year. Taxes and profit margins will push up the price to drivers, but it will still cost about half the cheapest car on today's market, a 25-year old model from rival Maruti Suzuki ( MRTI.BO ). The compact but curvy Nano stands in sharp contrast to the luxury Jaguar and Land Rover brands that Tata is negotiating to acquire from Ford Motor Co ( F.N ). "Let me assure you and our critics the car we have designed will meet all safety norms and all foreign environmental criteria," Chairman Ratan Tata said as he proudly unveiled what had been dubbed the "People's Car" at the Auto Expo in New Delhi. Hundreds of people crowded into the pavilion to see the launch, standing on chairs to get the best view as Tata introduced and then drove the car onto the stage. Tata planned the car years ago as a safer and affordable alternative for the millions who often ferry families of four, plus baggage, on motorbikes and scooters. "It's a dream come true," Ashok Singh, a constable with the Delhi Police, said at the show. "I look forward to buying that car. My wife will be really happy."

Tata said the car would have a rear-mounted engine and travel 20 km per liter. It would be offered in a basic model and two deluxe variants. Tata has said it will initially produce about 250,000 Nanos and expects eventual annual demand of 1 million units. It has sent global car makers scurrying to make their own version of a low-cost car to meet the needs of cost-conscious consumers in emerging economies such as China, India and Russia. Ford this week said it would build a small car in India within two years, while the alliance of Nissan Motor ( 7203.T ) and Renault ( RENA.PA ), which has made a big success of its no-frills Logan sedan, plans a $3,000 car with India's Bajaj Auto ( BJAT.BO ). Volkswagen ( VOWG.DE ), Toyota ( 7203.T ), Honda ( 7267.T ) and Fiat have also said they are looking at small cars for emerging markets where strong economic growth has made car ownership a reality for millions. Tata said it would focus on the home market for 2-3 years before considering exporting the Nano to countries in Africa, Latin America and Southeast Asia. With just 8 people in 1,000 owning a car in India, there is huge potential to upgrade bike and scooter owners, who bought about 7 million two-wheelers in 2006/07.
