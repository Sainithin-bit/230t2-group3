 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Chico's FAS Inc ( CHS.N ) said on Thursday sales at stores open at least a year fell 13.7 percent in December due to promotions and higher markdowns, and the women's apparel retailer also forecast a loss for the quarter.

The company expects to post a loss of also forecast a loss of 13 cents to 16 cents a share for the fourth quarter, not the break-even results it forecast a month ago. "Although we are certainly not pleased with the results of this quarter, we remain committed to returning to profitability in the first quarter of fiscal 2008," Scott Edmonds, chairman and chief executive, said. The company is lowering its inventory plans for the first half of 2008, Edmonds said.
