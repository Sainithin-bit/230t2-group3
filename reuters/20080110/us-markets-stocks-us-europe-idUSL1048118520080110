 LONDON  (Reuters) - Stock futures eased on Thursday, suggesting Wall Street shares may pare some of the previous day's gains as investors await word on the outlook for monetary policy from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke. 

 By 5:50 a.m. EST stock futures were down between 0.1 and 0.2 percent, following a sharp rally the day before. U.S. stocks have had one of the worst starts to the year in history as the twin forces of the credit crunch and housing slowdown threaten seriously to undermine consumer spending, thereby raising the risk of economic recession. On Wednesday, Goldman Sachs rattled global equity markets with a forecast of recession in 2008. Reports Citigroup ( C.N ) and Merrill Lynch MER.N were seeking to raise more capital with foreign partners to offset losses stemming from the credit crunch may help financials. Interest rate decisions from the European Central Bank and the Bank of England may restrict trade along with anticipation before a much-awaited speech from Bernanke, who speaks on "Financial Markets, the Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy" at an event at 1:00 p.m. EST. "As fears continue to circle around the state of the US economy investors continue to try and pick up the so called defensive stocks. So far drug makers and mining stocks are proving the most resilient to any economic downturn in the U.S.," said CMC Markets in a note. The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday Citigroup and Merrill Lynch are in discussions to receive more capital from investors, primarily foreign governments. Citigroup could get as much as $10 billion, likely all from foreign governments, while Merrill is expected to get $3 billion to $4 billion, much of it from a Middle Eastern government investment fund, the report said. Citi shares were the most actively traded in Europe, rising 3.4 percent from their last close in Frankfurt to 18.76 euros TRV.F, while Merrill shares rallied by more than 6 percent from their last close in Frankfurt to 34.50 euros MER.F, although volumes were extremely light. A number of U.S. investment banks including Citi, Merrill and Morgan Stanley have raised capital by selling stakes to foreign government investment funds, after recording big losses linked to the U.S. subprime lending crisis. Separately the Financial Times said Bear Stearns BSC.N held but abandoned talks for a tie-up with asset management firm Fortress Investments LLC ( FIG.N ). In Europe, Bear Stearns shares rose nearly 3 percent from their last close on the German market to 50.83 euros BSC.F. No major companies are scheduled to report earnings on Thursday after aluminum producer Alcoa Inc. ( AA.N ) kicked off the reporting season on Wednesday. Its shares rose 2.4 percent in after-hours electronic trading after reporting quarterly results that beat analysts' expectations. Shares in UPS ( UPS.N ), a good gauge of global economic strength, rose 2.3 percent in after-hours trade on Wednesday after the company announced a five-fold increase of its share buyback program. In Europe, UPS shares eased 0.7 percent from their last close in Frankfurt to 45.50 euros ( UPS.F ). The data calendar holds weekly initial jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. EST and monthly wholesale inventory figures for November at 10:00 a.m. EST. (Editing by Quentin Bryar)
