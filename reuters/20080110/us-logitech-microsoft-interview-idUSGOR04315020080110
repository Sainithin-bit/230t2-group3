 ZURICH  (Reuters) - Swiss-based Logitech's LOGN.VX largest shareholder and board member Daniel Borel said he had no reason to sell his stake in the computer peripherals group and declined to comment on rumors Microsoft( MSFT.O ) could bid for the firm. 

 "I am a co-founder of Logitech. Would you be willing to sell your child?" Borel told Reuters in an interview when asked whether he would be prepared to sell his 6 percent stake in Logitech. "I have no reason to sell. But I will not be the one to decide. I own only some 6 percent so I will neither enable nor prevent a sale of Logitech. At the end the shareholders will be the ones who will decide if they want to sell," said Borel. Borel declined to comment on rumors that Microsoft, the world's largest software firm would make a bid for Logitech, the world's largest maker of computer mice. "Rumors are rumors. I can't make any specific comment on them," said Borel, Logitech's former chairman. "Microsoft is above all a software company -- it is a very, very large company and only in a couple of "small" fields we compete with each other," said Borel when asked whether Microsoft would be a good partner for Logitech. "Logitech is a company that is in great shape. It is growing nicely and above all it has a strong vision for the future," he said. (Reporting by  Katie Reid )
