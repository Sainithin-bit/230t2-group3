 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Kohl's Corp ( KSS.N ), a mid-priced department store chain, on Thursday reported an 11.4 percent fall in December sales at stores open at least a year and cut its fourth-quarter profit forecast. 

 Kohl's, based in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, said it offered discounts to lure shoppers that pressured its gross margins. Analysts on average were expecting Kohl's December same-store sales to fall 7.9 percent, according to Reuters Estimates. (Reporting by  Karen Jacobs ; Editing by  Derek Caney )
