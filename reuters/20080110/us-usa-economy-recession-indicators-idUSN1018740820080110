 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. job growth is weakening, manufacturing activity is slowing and businesses and consumers have tightened up on spending as the economy teeters on the edge of recession. 

 During the third quarter the economy expanded at a 4.9 percent annual rate, according to the Commerce Department's gross domestic product report, which measures total output of goods and services within U.S. borders. But the outlook for the final three months of 2007 and most of 2008 are not expected to be as bright. A recession is commonly defined as two consecutive quarters of back-to-back negative readings on GDP. The Commerce Department's initial take on the fourth quarter, which many are now forecasting to show a contraction, will be available at the end of this month. Below are some key economic reports, many of which are used to compile the GDP data, that economists are watching to gauge if the economy is slipping into recession. - LABOR DEPARTMENT'S EMPLOYMENT SITUATION REPORT In December, the economy added just 18,000 jobs, bringing the employment rate up 0.3 percentage point to 5.0 percent, the highest in two years. Employment is a lagging indicator and the last key piece toward mapping out a recession. Economists generally view this report as recessionary when the unemployment rate rises by 0.5 percent or more from the low point of a business cycle or by 0.3 percent on a three-month rolling basis. Firms will cut back on hours and hold off on business investments before cutting their workforce, particularly in such a tight labor market, but prospects of an economic downturn will indeed drive businesses to stop hiring and even consider trimming their workforce. - CONFERENCE BOARD'S INDEX OF LEADING ECONOMIC INDICATORS The New York-based conference board last reported that this index fell by twice what was expected in November after dropping in October, pointing to a slowing economy ahead. The index is compiled from several leading indicators such as initial jobless claims, consumer goods orders, capital goods orders, building permits, stock prices and Treasury yield curves. A pattern of weak readings from this index is customarily seen as recessionary. - COMMERCE DEPARTMENT'S BUSINESS AND WHOLESALE INVENTORIES  REPORTS The Commerce Department releases two separate reports on inventories - from businesses and from wholesalers. These reports are a good gauge of expected demand. Businesses will build their inventories if they expect increased demand. The most recent data, available at present through November, is showing that businesses did not build inventories and economists say this will be a drag on GDP. Expectations are that the inventory correction will no doubt spill over into the first part of this year. The stock to sales ratio of inventories, which measures the number of months it would take to deplete stocks at the current sales rates, has been at record low levels. - MANUFACTURING ACTIVITY REPORT FROM THE INSTITUTE FOR  SUPPLY MANAGEMENT The Tempe, Arizona-based Institute for Supply Management's report on manufacturing activity in the United States is a closely watched gauge of economic activity. In December the index reading slipped below 50 to 47.7. A reading below 50 indicates a contraction. A reading at 42 or below is seen by economists as a clear sign the economy is already in a recession. - COMMERCE DEPARTMENT'S RETAIL SALES AND PERSONAL INCOME  REPORTS The Commerce Department's monthly retail sales report is a crucial gauge in consumer spending, which fuels two-thirds of economic growth. Retail sales were up a much stronger-than-expected 1.2 percent in November but much of that reflected a huge increase in gasoline prices. The department's personal income report is another key report to watch at a turning point in a business cycle because it will show if both income is rising and at the same time if consumers are spending or saving. Higher energy prices have skewed this report, with spending rising at the fastest rate in more than two years in November. But excluding energy, spending was much more modest and the personal saving rate went into negative territory for the first time in 15 months. - COMMERCE DEPARTMENT'S REPORT ON HOUSING STARTS New home building activity not only measures the health of the housing sector, but it is used by economists to gauge the health of the broader economy because building generates jobs and spending. Housing starts have plummeted this year and as the housing market turmoil continues, they are not expected to rebound until well into this year. - NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS PENDING HOME SALES  INDEX The Washington, D.C.-based National Association of Realtors tracks sales of all homes but this pending sales index, based on contracts signed during a particular month, is closely watched when the U.S. economy is at a turning points because it is seen as a good gauge of future housing activity. Pending home sales fell in November but by less than was expected and economists were mixed over whether this was a sign of stability or of further declines ahead.
