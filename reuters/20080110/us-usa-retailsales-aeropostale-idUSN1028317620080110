 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Teen clothing retailer Aeropostale Inc ( ARO.N ) reported a greater-than-expected increase in December same-store sales on Thursday and raised its fourth-quarter earnings estimate. 

 Aeropostale, which had broad discounts in the month, said sales at stores open at least a year rose 12.2 percent in December, far exceeding analysts' average estimate of 3.6 percent, according to Reuters Estimates. Total net sales rose  17.5 percent to $313.5 for the five weeks ended January 5. The company said it now expects fourth-quarter operating earnings of 87 cents per share, up from its prior forecast of 82 cents to 84 cents per share. Including a benefit related to the settlement of a dispute, the company expects 91 cents per share. (Reporting by  Martinne Geller ; editing by John Wallace)
