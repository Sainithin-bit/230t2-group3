 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - CBS Corp ( CBS.N ) will see growth in 2008 in "every single division," including its embattled radio business, Chief Executive Les Moonves told an analyst conference on Thursday. 

 "The fundamentals of all our businesses are sound. As we look toward a potential downturn in the economy we haven't seen any evidence of it," Moonves told Citigroup's Annual Global Entertainment, Media & Telecommunications Conference. Moonves said that while the Hollywood writers strike "is bothering me a great deal," it will not affect the company's bottom line "in the short term and the medium term." CBS expects to reap about 10 percent of an estimated $3 billion in political advertising this year, Moonves said. "Generally speaking, there is no reason why we shouldn't have 10 percent of the marketplace," he said. He would not confirm analysts' estimates that the network stood to gain $250 million from political advertising at its owned and operated stations. "I'm not going to verify it or not," Moonves said, "but I won't tell you  are crazy. "We are going to benefit greatly. We are the biggest TV station owner in the major markets," he said. Shares of CBS rose 3 percent to $24.72 in late afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by  Gina Keating ; Editing by  Brian Moss )
