 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - The following is a summary of recent comments by Fed policy-makers: 

 * Denotes 2008 voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets U.S. monetary policy. * FED CHAIRMAN BEN BERNANKE, JAN 10: "In light of recent changes in the outlook for and the risks to growth, additional policy easing may be necessary. We stand ready to take substantive additional action as needed to support growth and to provide adequate insurance against downside risks. "Incoming information has suggested that the baseline outlook for real activity in 2008 has worsened and the downside risks to growth have become more pronounced. "Thus far, inflation expectations appear to have remained reasonably well anchored ... However, any tendency of inflation expectations to become unmoored or for the Fed's inflation-fighting credibility to be eroded could greatly complicate the task of sustaining price stability. "The Committee must remain exceptionally alert and flexible, prepared to act in a decisive and timely manner." KANSAS CITY FED PRESIDENT WILLIAM HOENIG, JAN 10: "It is fair to say that the U.S. economy has been under considerable stress over the last several months ... But it is also interesting and important to keep in mind that we are also seeing rising inflation pressures, especially as we look at commodities and energy costs. I would be very careful not to let inflation accelerate too long. "While I know the economy is slowing, I think there is at least a case to be made that the economy will come out of this slow growth ... and hopefully return to our potential growth rate over the course of the year." ST LOUIS FED PRESIDENT WILLIAM POOLE, JAN 9: "Will housing sector problems push the economy into recession? It is too early to tell right now, but what we can do is to examine the current situation closely and learn from it." "The current financial turmoil will take a while to play itself out. The fundamentals of our economy remain strong, however, and 2008 looks to be a year of rising growth." BOSTON FED PRESIDENT ERIC ROSENGREN, JAN 8: "My view is that the continued decline in residential investment has heightened the risk of a more significant downturn in the overall economy. Falling house prices ... are also likely to dampen consumer and business confidence and spending." "I think it is important to note that the Federal Reserve has taken action on several fronts to date -- actions that should help reduce the downside risk to the real economy." * PHILADELPHIA FED PRESIDENT CHARLES PLOSSER, JAN 8: "I am concerned that developments on the inflation front will make the Fed's policy decisions more difficult in 2008." "There are risks to the downside of even weaker economic growth" that "may require further adjustments to policy. At the same time we also face risks of higher inflation ... Inflation is not dead. Expectations are tenuous." "Since monetary policy's effects on the economy occur with a lag, there is little monetary policy can do today to change economic activity in the first half of 2008." ATLANTA FED PRESIDENT DENNIS LOCKHART, JAN 7: "The negatives in our economy may be gaining momentum. I think these circumstances call for policy-makers to be prepared to respond pragmatically to whatever developments arise." "I'm concerned about inflation ... but I'm equally or more concerned about ... mounting slowness" in the economy. "I'm predicting a slowing but growing economy." * FED VICE CHAIRMAN DONALD KOHN, JAN 5: "The public should understand that the FOMC members do not coordinate schedules and messages, and that members' views are likely to be especially diverse when, as in the current situation, circumstances are changing quickly and are subject to man different analyses." RICHMOND FED PRESIDENT JEFFREY LACKER, DEC 19 "I have to say that I am uncomfortable with the inflation picture, and disappointed that the improvement we saw earlier this year was not more lasting." "I am also troubled by the lengthy divergence we've seen between overall and core inflation." "Because the job of a central banker is to protect the purchasing power of currency, it is overall inflation that we need to keep down, not just core inflation. ... If energy prices fail to decline, monetary policy decisions will be that much more difficult in 2008." "For now, I am comfortable with what we've done. But we will take it a meeting at a time and we will see how the data unfolds going forward." * DALLAS FED PRESIDENT RICHARD FISHER, DEC 18 "The actions we've taken should provide some buoyancy through the course of next year to the economy. But I want to make sure that we don't overreact and create further problems down the road." "Cutting rates, doing the things we've done, will facilitate economic growth next year from where it otherwise would have been. But I am also mindful of the fact that we've got some inflationary pressures building, and so we have to be careful that we don't stir those embers." "The fed funds rate should be geared to the economy...I don't know with precision what the time lags are, but I know there is a time lag, and it takes a while for it (policy action) to come into the economy."
