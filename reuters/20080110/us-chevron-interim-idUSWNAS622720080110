 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Chevron Corp ( CVX.N ) said on Thursday fourth-quarter earnings should rise sequentially due to higher oil prices, but lower profits from gasoline production would restrain results for the second straight quarter. 

 The second-largest U.S. oil and gas company said the average domestic price it received for crude oil during the first two months of the quarter was $80.48 a barrel, up from $68.70 a barrel in the third quarter. Chevron's average international price for hydrocarbon liquids rose about 18 percent to $79.49 a barrel. Chevron said its U.S. natural gas prices rose about 5.5 percent in the period, while international natural gas prices were up about 14 percent. Refining margins continued to be weak during the fourth quarter, Chevron said, noting it expects profits from its refining and marketing operations to remain low in the period. It said its realized margins in the quarter will be lower than industry indicators, especially in the United States, due in part to refinery outages. Margins to produce gasoline and other refined products have plummeted across the industry as prices for the fuel have not kept pace with surging crude oil prices. Refining margins dragged down earnings at practically all the oil companies that both produced and refined the fuel in the third quarter. They look primed to rein in fourth quarter earnings as well, despite oil prices that averaged around $90 a barrel. (Reporting by  Michael Erman , editing by Leslie Gevirtz; Editing by  Andre Grenon )
