 (Reuters) - India's Tata Motors on Thursday unveiled its 'People's Car', the 4-door Nano, which will be the world's cheapest car with a dealer price of 100,000 rupees ($2,500). 

 Following are some details on the car, which was presented at the Auto Expo in New Delhi. * Length: 3.1 meters * Height: 1.6 meters * Width: 1.5 meters * Engine: Rear-wheel drive, 2-cylinder, 623 cc, multi-point fuel-injection petrol engine. Engine is rear mounted. Tata said it was the first time a 2-cylinder gasoline engine was being used in a car with single balancer shaft. * Safety: Tata said the Nano has an all sheet-metal body, with safety features such as crumple zones, intrusion-resistant doors, seat-belts, strong seats and anchorages, and the rear tailgate glass bonded to the body. Tires are tubeless. * Environment: Tata said tailpipe emission performance exceeded current regulatory requirements, and the Nano had a lower overall pollution level than two-wheelers made in India. It said high fuel efficiency (20 km/liter) ensured low carbon dioxide emissions. (Compiled by John Mair in Mumbai, Editing by Mark Williams/Ian Geoghegan)
