 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The White House is considering a number of stimulus options that may be needed to bolster a flagging U.S. economy, but says it is "premature" to discuss details. 

 There are no shortage of recommendations from both conservative and liberal camps. Following is a selection of suggested actions: SEN. HILLARY CLINTON, Democratic U.S. presidential candidate: -- Create $5 billion community support fund to help prevent mortgage foreclosures. -- Provide $2 billion in emergency home heating and home weatherization funds for cold weather states. -- Enact 90-day subprime foreclosure moratorium on owner-occupied homes, freeze subprime mortgage rates for up to five years. SEN. BARACK OBAMA, Democratic U.S. presidential candidate: --Tax credit of up to $500 per person, $1,000 per family to offset payroll taxes. -- Says plan would eliminate payroll taxes for some 10 million people, ease short-term pressure on household budgets and lift consumer spending. MARTIN FELDSTEIN, president, National Bureau of Economic Research and White House economic adviser under President Ronald Reagan: -- Small tax cut immediately as a "down payment" against a recession. -- Pass legislation to provide a more extensive stimulus that would be triggered if the economy "softens substantially". -- Knowledge that additional stimulus lies in reserve would help underpin investor confidence and encourage business investment. ROBERT RUBIN, executive chairman, Citigroup Inc., former U.S. Treasury Secretary. -- Move "proactively" with stimulus package "in the area of $100 billion" targeted at families most vulnerable to downturn. -- Possible options include tax rebates, increased unemployment benefits and food stamps, aid to states. -- Would prefer that stimulus not be conditional upon worsening conditions, says risks to economy are strong enough to warrant action now. MARK ZANDI, founder, Moody's Economy.com: -- Quickly enact $100 billion stimulus plan to offset "tax increase" expected this spring from gasoline prices approaching $4 a gallon. -- Extend unemployment benefits, food stamps; enact tax rebate. LAWRENCE SUMMERS, Harvard University professor and U.S. Treasury Secretary under President Bill Clinton: -- Target tax rebates, increased unemployment compensation and food stamp benefits quickly to low-income people and those losing jobs. -- Package size of $50 billion to $75 billion over two to three quarters would provide a 1 percentage point boost to gross domestic product growth over a year and would not significantly increase long-term deficits. ALAN GREENSPAN, former Federal Reserve chairman: -- Prefers giving cash directly to troubled homeowners rather than forcing lenders to renegotiate contracts. He called it "emergency aid" similar to natural disaster assistance. ECONOMIC POLICY INSTITUTE, liberal Washington think tank: -- Accelerate needed public investments in roads, bridges, schools, alternative fuels. -- Provide emergency assistance to revenue-strapped states to avert state tax hikes, services cuts or layoffs. -- Provide targeted tax relief to working families who will quickly spend the money on necessities. -- Sufficient scale needed; $130 billion (about 1 percent of GDP) a "moderate first step." CENTER FOR BUDGET AND POLICY PRIORITIES, liberal Washington think tank: -- Provide quick cash benefits through increased unemployment benefits, fiscal relief to states, tax cuts aimed at low-income households, increased child tax credit. -- Tax cuts aimed at high-income individuals are poor candidates, since the funds are more likely to be saved; they have little impact when the need is greatest and only kick in when the economy is reviving anyway. -- Stimulus should be temporary, terminating when the economy strengthens. The action should not leave the country with permanent, deficit-increasing tax cuts or spending increases. BRIAN RIEDL, analyst at conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington: -- Cuts in individual and corporate income taxes would "encourage work, savings and investment." -- Reducing corporate tax rate would make U.S. firms more competitive with those in foreign countries with lower marginal tax rates. -- Tax rebate would "just move money from one part of the economy and put it in an another part of the economy." CESAR CONDA, former domestic policy adviser to Vice President Dick Cheney, now with consulting firm Navigators LLC in Washington: -- Reduce corporate income-tax rates. -- Accelerate write-offs for business investment as the administration did in Bush's first term. -- Considers tax rebates merely "dropping money out of a helicopter to consumers." BRUCE JOSTEN, executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington: -- Accelerate depreciation of business investments. -- Enact business tax credits, reduce corporate capital gains tax rates. -- Renew expiring provisions of Bush tax cuts enacted during the last recession in 2001 and 2003. "Not renewing the Bush tax cuts would clearly flip this economy into recession," he said. (Reporting by  David Lawder ; Editing by Leslie Adler)
