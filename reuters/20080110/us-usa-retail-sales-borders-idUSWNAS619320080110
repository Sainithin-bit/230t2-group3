 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Borders Group Inc BGP.N said on Thursday sales in the holiday period rose 2.4 percent at its Borders bookstores open at least one year, outperforming rival Barnes & Noble Inc ( BKS.N ) and sending Borders shares higher. 

 The company also said it expects fourth-quarter earnings at or down from the $1.45 a share reported a year earlier, excluding one-time charges and discontinued operations. (Reporting by  Brad Dorfman ; Editing by Dave Zimmerman)
