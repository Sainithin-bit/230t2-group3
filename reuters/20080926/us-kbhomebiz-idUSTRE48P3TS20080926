 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Builder KB Home ( KBH.N ) reported a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss on Friday as revenue fell by more than half because of the ongoing housing slump. 

 The No. 5 U.S. home builder posted a net loss of $144.7 million, or $1.87 per share, for the third quarter ended on August 31, compared with a loss of $35.6 million, or 46 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting a loss of $1.40 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue fell 56 percent to $681.6 million, missing analysts' estimates of $724.6 million. Excluding a gain from the sale of KB Home's French operations, the year-earlier loss was $6.19 per share. The Los Angeles company's shares were down 2.2 percent at $20.69 in morning New York Stock Exchange trade. (Reporting by  Helen Chernikoff ; Editing by  Derek Caney  and Lisa Von Ahn)
