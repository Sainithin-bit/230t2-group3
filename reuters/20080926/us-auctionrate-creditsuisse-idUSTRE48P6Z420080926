 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A U.S. judge asked an indicted former Credit Suisse Group AG ( CSGN.VX ) broker on Friday to return $2 million he sent to his home country of Bulgaria, while he was being investigated for possible fraud in auction-rate securities deals. 

 Judge Jack Weinstein in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn also tentatively scheduled April 27 next year for the start of the trial of Bulgarian citizen Julian Tzolov and a former colleague, Eric Butler, who were both indicted on September 3. They are accused of fraud in unauthorized dealings while at Credit Suisse of auction-rate debt, securities that were the focus of an industrywide probe even before Wall Street plunged into a credit crisis that has shaken the financial system. Credit Suisse said both brokers resigned in September 2007 after the firm suspended them for "prohibited activity." Butler and Tzolov both pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges and were released on bail, although Tzolov's bail conditions limit him to his Manhattan apartment and he is required to wear an electronic tracking anklet. At a conference in court on Friday, Tzolov's attorney Ira Lee Sorkin described conditions of the $3 million bail package as "draconian," saying his client wanted to go out to look for a job, buy groceries and take walks in the park. He asked for a relaxation of the restrictions. Assistant U.S. Attorney Greg Andres said Tzolov had sent $2.3 million to Bulgaria through a Swiss bank during the investigation. Tzolov, who was in Bulgaria at the time of the indictment and returned to the United States voluntarily the next day, said the money was sent to his parents so they could buy property. "Get $2 million back and put it into escrow," the judge said at the court conference. Attorneys for Butler and Tzolov have said their clients would defend the criminal charges against them. In a separate civil complaint, the Securities and Exchange Commission said the two men made unauthorized purchases of more than $1 billion in auction-rate securities for corporate customers' accounts. Regulators nationwide are investigating the auction-rate debt market. They say brokerages misled investors into believing auction-rate debt, which has rates that reset in periodic auctions, was safe and the equivalent of cash. Much of the $330 billion market has been frozen since February. (Editing by  Andre Grenon )
