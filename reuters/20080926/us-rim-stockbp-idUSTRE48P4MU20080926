 OTTAWA  (Reuters) - Research In Motion Ltd RIM.TO RIMM.O shares sank nearly 27 percent on Friday as investors digested news that the company's profit will lag expectations as RIM spends heavily to develop a new crop of BlackBerry smartphones. 

 RIM, which reported second-quarter results after markets closed on Thursday, said its push into the consumer market, with handsets like the BlackBerry Bold, will pinch its gross profit margin in the near-term but pay off with market growth. That outlook sparked a nearly 20 percent stock drop after markets on Thursday and a string of downgrades from analysts -- unfamiliar territory for a market darling accustomed to fatter profits and upbeat guidance. At mid-session on Friday the shares were down 26.7 percent, at their lowest level in 13 months, making it the biggest net loser on both Nasdaq and the Toronto Stock Exchange. The shares tumbled to $71.43 on Nasdaq and C$73.97 on the TSX as investors ran for the exits. Rival Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ) was caught in the wake of RIM's selloff, dropping 4.3 percent on jitters that the whole sector may be in trouble. "People are concerned about the smartphone market," said Cross Research analyst Shannon Cross. Several analysts, surprised by RIM's poor outlook, said the selloff represented a buying opportunity. "We are disappointed that the weakness originates not in a temporary setback owing to a product transition but in a permanent step-down in gross margins," JPMorgan analyst Paul Coster said in a note. "That said, we believe this pullback is an excellent entry point into a tremendous growth stock, with the multiple at a multiyear low," Coster said. TD Newcrest analyst Chris Umiastowski said it appears that gross margins will drop by about 5 percent over the next two to three quarters. "We believe the company is making a bet on market share at the expense of gross margin. We understand the bet and think it is a smart move," Umiastowski wrote. "But overall, the Street tends to be short-sighted, and this explains the slaughtering of the stock." For other investors, RIM's future has suddenly become more difficult to predict, making the stock less attractive. The Waterloo, Ontario-based company is revamping its product line to expand its customer base, introducing the BlackBerry Pearl flip this month, for example. The bulk of cell phones sold in the United States have a clamshell or flip design. RIM is also preparing to launch a touch-screen phone to compete more directly with Apple's iPhone. RBC Capital Markets analyst Mike Abramsky downgraded RIM to "sector perform" from "outperform", citing uncertainty about the timing of margin recovery and increased risks to growth from economic woes. UBS cut its rating to "neutral" from "buy" and lowered the stock's target price to $88 from $165 because it has little conviction sales will grow in the near term. "Despite the sell-off, we find it difficult to recommend investors step in at current levels, given headwind expectations and our lack of conviction to revenue growth upside, both near and medium term," analysts Maynard Um and Jeffrey Fan said in a note. For its third quarter, RIM expects earnings per share of between 89 and 97 cents -- below analyst expectations -- and said gross margin would drop to 47 percent from 50.7 percent in the second quarter. The margin is expected to deteriorate further in the fourth quarter. It also forecast sales of $2.95 billion to $3.1 billion and the addition of 2.9 million subscribers.
