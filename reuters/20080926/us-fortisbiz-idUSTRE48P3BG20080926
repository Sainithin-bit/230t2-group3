 BRUSSELS/AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - Fortis FOR.BR on Friday denied it was facing a liquidity crisis and pledged to speed up asset sales as the Belgian-Dutch bank became the latest focus of investor concerns about the fragility of Europe's financial sector. 

 As its shares fell for the fifth straight day in feverish trade, the bank said it had a funding base of 300 billion euros and solid solvency ratios, and that it was in talks to raise 5 to 10 billion euros ($7.3 billion-$14.6 billion) from the sale of broader range of assets than previously intended. Fortis also moved to reassure depositors, assuring them their money was safe as it said withdrawals by account holders represented less than 3 percent of its total Benelux retail and private banking customers' assets. A "flabbergasted" Herman Verwilst, the group's interim chief executive, told a hastily convened news conference that the group's businesses were worth more than its current market value which, having sunk to a 14-year low on Thursday, is currently around 14 billion euros. That is barely more than half the price it paid, together with Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ) and Spain's Santander ( SAN.MC ), to buy Dutch rival ABN Amro as part of consortium last year. Traders said on Friday they were worried about the liquidity and funding of the bank. Broker Dresdner said that although Fortis' liquidity risk appeared moderate, there was an increasing likelihood that it would be taken over by BNP Paribas ( BNPP.PA ) or ING ( ING.AS ). Contacted by Reuters, BNP Paribas declined to comment. "We are flabbergasted by what is reflected in the market capitalization of Fortis," Verwilst told the news conference, adding that share price movements in recent days have reflected "lots of nervousness" and "emotions. The turmoil prompted the Belgian Finance Ministry to say it was consulting on Fortis with market regulators and the central bank. Fortis reported 94 billion euros in customer deposits at the end of June. There was no obvious increase in traffic at branches in Amsterdam and Brussels. The assistant manager of a large Fortis branch in central Brussels, Ludo De Wachter, said some account holders had withdrawn money but others were putting funds into savings accounts with attractive interest rates. Depositors, protected under law on deposits of up to 20,000 euros in Belgium and the Netherlands, would be reimbursed under all circumstances, Verwilst said. NERVOUS MARKETS The latest phase of Fortis' woes began in June when it announced an 8 billion euro capital program, including a 1.5 billion euro share issue and dividend suspension to shore up its capital. Shareholder anger at that prompted the resignation of previous CEO Jean-Paul Votron. Europe's money markets remained paralyzed on Friday, despite increased liquidity injections from central banks around the world, as U.S. political wrangling appeared to stall the passing of a $700 billion bailout plan. Liquidity concerns pushed credit default swaps (CDS) on Fortis' five-year senior debt 75 basis points wider to 425 basis points on Friday. Fortis shares were down 10.7 percent at 5.83 euros at 1150 GMT after touching a 14-year low of 5.5 euros on Thursday. Shares in Belgian rival Dexia ( DEXI.BR ) were down 6.8 percent. "I think it's retail investors now heading for the exit," a Brussels-based trader said. "It's irrational behavior." Belgian financial authorities said they were refraining from taking any action on Fortis. The Dutch market regulator AFM declined to comment specifically on Fortis, but a spokeswoman said: "We look very closely at movements like that." Belgian Finance Minister Didier Reynders called for calm around Fortis, one of the country's three biggest banks, after a cabinet meeting on Friday and urged market participants not to spread rumors. "We guarantee no client, no saver, would be left in the cold," Reynders said. The Dutch central bank (DNB) did not comment. In Asia, Fortis partner and China's second-biggest insurer, Ping An Insurance ( 2318.HK ), saw its shares dive 10 percent on concerns over Fortis. Ping An owns 5 percent of Fortis. The recent financial crisis, which has seen the collapse or failure of several U.S. banks, has raised funding costs, hurting Fortis' plan to pay for its 24 billion euros acquisition of Dutch bank ABN AMRO's local activities last year. SEEKING ASSET BUYERS Fortis executives sought to reassure investors on the progress of asset sales, saying that 10 deals have been earmarked for sale in its banking and insurance businesses. "It has been decided to implement a wider range of activities of assets to be divested, sold," Fortis said in a statement. "These activities to be divested are located as well in and outside Benelux. The total estimates are between 5 billion and 10 billion euros. So far on every file concrete interest of potential buyers is indicated and confidentiality agreements have been signed." But ING analyst Albert Ploegh said Fortis would have to be more specific. "They need to act on the disposal program," Ploegh said. Fortis shares had dropped on Thursday on denied market talk that the Dutch Central Bank (DNB) had asked Dutch rival Rabobank RABN.UL to support its liquidity position. Fortis and Rabobank denied the speculation.
