 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, who last week began investigating short-selling abuses in the stock market, is now taking a hard look at whether credit-default swaps are being used to push down share prices, a person familiar with the probe told Reuters Friday. 

 Cuomo has issued subpoenas to three market-data providers that produce reports on the price of CDS, which bond investors purchase to protect themselves against defaults. The providers are Markit Group Ltd, Depository Trust & Clearing Corp and Bloomberg LP. The state believes swaps may have been used by short-sellers to spread negative rumors about companies and then gain from the declines in their stock prices. Cuomo's office believes the three data providers can help identify parties engaging in swap transactions and pinpoint when positions were taken. "These credit default swaps are being manipulated in a way to make the markets think a company is less healthy than it really is," the person familiar said. "That's another potential form of spreading false rumors." The CDS market is largely unregulated and opaque, comprised of privately negotiated contracts among fund managers and broker-dealers. Cuomo's office, Markit and DTCC declined to comment. Bloomberg was not immediately available for comment. Bloomberg competes with Thomson Reuters Corp in providing news and market data. The CDS market has emerged as a closely-watched barometer for investors, as a number of corporate failures followed surging costs in their protection costs. The $55 trillion market has also been accused of fueling turmoil in other financial markets and contributing to the collapse of companies like Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEHMQ.PK. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating the CDS market in connection with its probe of short-selling. New York investigators last Thursday subpoenaed hedge funds from New York, Texas and London, seeking information on their short-selling and CDS activities, the person said. Broker-dealers already have also provided data about these markets. The state probe seeks data about short sales and swap deals since July 1, with the primary focus on the past few weeks. The probe is centered on stock and CDS trading activity surrounding American International Group Inc ( AIG.N ), Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ), Lehman, Merrill Lynch & Co MER.N, Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) and Washington Mutual Inc ( WM.N ).
