 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oil settled more than $1 lower on Friday, with trading volatile due to uncertainty about a bailout package for the U.S. financial sector after talks between U.S. politicians stalled. 

 The $700 billion deal to rescue the faltering U.S. financial system hit a wall on Thursday amid bickering between Democrats and Republicans. U.S. crude settled at $106.89 a barrel, down $1.13, after trading between $104.25 and $108.11. London Brent crude settled at $103.54, down $1.06. "Coming off yesterday's strong finish, prices were knocked lower when a tentative plan to bail out the nation's mortgage crisis fell apart," said Mike Fitzpatrick, vice president at MF Global in New York. "Additionally, Washington Mutual was seized by federal regulators." Uncertainty about details of the bailout package, and how quickly it would relieve the distressed U.S. financial sector led to some volatility, analysts said. "A key focal point for a lot of traders is how are they going to handle that toxic debt on the banks' balance sheets," said Rob Kurzatkowski, futures analyst with optionsXpress. "There's been a lot of people speaking today, you've seen politicians on the TV all day, but there really hasn't been anything that traders can latch on to at this point." Oil prices have dropped from record highs over $147 a barrel struck in July as the economic crisis and high fuel costs hurt demand in the United States and other developed economies. Further pressure has come as investors -- who flocked into oil and other commodities earlier this year as a hedge against inflation and the weak dollar -- shift into safer havens. Oil has found some support from supply disruptions in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, home to a quarter of U.S. crude production, caused by Hurricane Ike. Recovery from those disruptions continues. Shell Oil ( RDSa.L ), the largest producer in the Gulf of Mexico, expects the bulk of its offshore fields back on line within two weeks. The International Energy Agency said Thursday it did not need to release emergency stocks to bolster supplies, even though nearly 60 percent of the region's output remained shut.
