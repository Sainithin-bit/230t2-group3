 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. economy contracted at a steeper-than-expected pace in the first quarter, weighed down by sharp declines in exports and business inventories, according government data on Wednesday that showed the economy was still deep in recession. 

 KEY POINTS: * Gross domestic product, which measures total goods and services output within U.S. borders, dropped at a 6.1 percent annual rate in the first quarter, the Commerce Department said, after shrinking 6.3 percent in the fourth quarter. * Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast GDP falling at a 4.9 percent rate in the January-March quarter. * Output has declined for three straight quarters for the first time since 1974-1975. * The advance report from the Commerce Department showed business inventories plummeted by a record $103.7 billion in the first quarter, as firms worked to reduce stocks of unsold goods in their warehouses. * Excluding inventories, GDP contracted 3.4 percent. * Investment by businesses tumbled a record 37.9 percent in the first quarter, while residential investment dived 38 percent, the biggest decline since the second quarter of 1980. * Consumer spending, which accounts for over two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose 2.2 percent, after collapsing in the second half of last year. COMMENTS: DOUG BENDER, MANAGING DIRECTOR, MCQUEEN, BALL & ASSOCIATES, BETHLEHEM, PENNSYLVANIA: "The GDP data is in line with where the fourth quarter was, which we knew was weak. We have had two quarters of very poor performance. "GDP is in the rear view mirror. We know the first quarter was still very weak. But the way the bond market will trade today will be more influenced by what the Treasury announces in terms of its refunding and what the Fed statement says." MICHAEL DARDA, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MARKET STRATEGIST, MKM PARTNERS LLC, GREENWICH CT: "It's not as bad as it looks. The headline figure shows a dramatic decline, but that was driven by a decline in government spending, which we know is temporary. It's worth noting that consumption was positive and better than expected. "I think that the last quarter of last year and this quarter will mark the largest declines we're likely to see in this recession, and beyond this the decline will start to disappear. There won't be positive growth until the second half of the year probably, but the fall in the second quarter, if it's negative at all, will be far smaller." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stock index futures pare gains after bigger-than-expected contraction in Q1 GDP. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices steady. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar gains versus euro.
