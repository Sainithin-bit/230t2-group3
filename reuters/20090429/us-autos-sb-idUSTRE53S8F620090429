 DETROIT/WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Chrysler rushed to clinch deals with Fiat SpA and secured lenders on Wednesday in a last-ditch effort to avoid bankruptcy with a day remaining until a government-imposed restructuring deadline. 

 U.S. President Barack Obama said it was still uncertain whether Chrysler would complete the Fiat alliance which the White House has set as a condition for investing up to $6 billion more in the automaker. Three fund management companies that hold Chrysler LLC's secured debt were holding out against the proposed terms in the automaker's debt restructuring talks as of Wednesday afternoon, people briefed on the negotiations told Reuters. An Obama administration official added that Chrysler talks could run up to the deadline of 11:59 p.m. EDT on Thursday. "We're hoping we can get a merger where the taxpayers will put in some money to sweeten the deal but ultimately the goal is -- we get out of the business of building cars and Chrysler goes and starts creating the cars that consumers want," Obama said in a town hall-style meeting near St. Louis. Fiat and Chrysler are prepared to complete a merger deal by Thursday that would be taken into bankruptcy court as a key element of the U.S. automaker's restructuring plan if needed, a person with direct knowledge of the preparations said. Meanwhile, Chrysler's almost 27,000 U.S. factory workers represented by the United Auto Workers union were scheduled to conclude voting on Wednesday on a range of cost-cutting steps intended to make the automaker's wage and benefits competitive with its leanest rivals in the U.S. market. That UAW deal, which would also give the union a 55 percent stake in a restructured Chrysler, is one of several hurdles that the automaker has been rushing to clear in recent days. If the new UAW contract is ratified as widely expected, the last major obstacle to Chrysler's bid to avoid liquidation and restructure under the supervision of the Obama administration's autos task force would be reaching agreement with its lenders. Treasury Department officials reached an agreement with Chrysler's largest bank creditors on Monday to cancel $6.9 billion of debt in exchange for $2 billion in cash. "If approved, it would clear a significant hurdle on our continuing journey toward long-term success, but the proposed agreement still needs to be approved by all of the secured lenders," Chrysler Chief Executive Bob Nardelli said in a memo to staff obtained by Reuters. The three creditors unprepared to accept the U.S. Treasury's offer of $2 billion in cash to extinguish $6.9 billion in secured debt were Oppenheimer Funds, Perella Weinberg Partners and Stairway Capital, sources said. About 45 financial institutions hold Chrysler's secured debt. Failure to win their support would send the automaker into bankruptcy, officials have said. For that reason, some analysts see a Chrysler bankruptcy filing as a way for the automaker to compel creditors to accept less than the full amount of debt stemming from the 2007 deal to spin off Chrysler from Germany's Daimler AG. GM BONDHOLDERS PROTEST Chrysler's race to restructure has played out as a kind of prelude to the slower-moving process under way for its larger rival General Motors Corp. GM bondholders who represent about $27 billion of the automaker's debt are being asked to write off about 90 percent of what they are owed in a debt-for-equity exchange that the automaker launched this week over the protests of some investors. Individual GM bondholders lambasted the exchange offer from the struggling U.S. automaker on Wednesday, saying they have been shut out of restructuring plans in favor of the U.S. government and organized labor. "What they've offered us is ridiculous," said Chris Crowe, 50, a Denver, Colorado-based home inspector at an event organized for small bondholders in this Detroit suburb. "I know there are only so many pieces of pie, but they're giving us crumbs." Auto dealers affiliated with both Chrysler and GM announced that they had hired a pair of high-profile law firms to represent their interests in the government-directed restructuring of both firms. GM, which has been kept in operation with $15.4 billion of U.S. government funding, has until June 1 to push ahead with its own restructuring which includes plans to cut 40 percent of its U.S. dealers in less than two years. Auto dealers are independently owned and protected by state franchise laws that industry executives have said could make it very expensive and difficult for GM to shut down dealerships. GM's national dealer council hired Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP, the firm confirmed on Wednesday, a day after dealers demanded compensated in exchange for closing. Chrysler's national dealer body hired Arnold & Porter LLP, the firm said on Wednesday.
