 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Anheuser-Busch InBev NV has told General Electric Co's NBC that it will spend only about half as much on its coming Olympic advertising package as it did on the previous one, the Wall Street Journal said. 

 Citing a person familiar with the matter, the Wall Street Journal said that the brewer won't seek to be the exclusive beer advertiser on NBC's broadcast of next year's Vancouver winter games or the 2012 London games, which are included in the package. Rival beer giant MillerCoors LLC is now trying to see if it can get into NBC's Olympic broadcast, the Wall Street Journal said on its web site. Representative from Anheuser-Busch InBev and MillerCoors could not be reached for comment. NBC could also not be reached for comment late Tuesday.
