 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The head of the $700 billion rescue fund created to restore the U.S. financial system will likely make Friday his last day on the job, The Washington Post reported. 

 Neel Kashkari has taken the brunt of Congress' criticism of the bailout program but is credited with helping keep the country out of a complete financial meltdown. Former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson tasked him with heading the $700 billion program to bring the country out of the biggest financial crisis in generations after Congress approved the bailout package in October. He was asked to stay on as the Treasury Department's interim assistant secretary for financial stability to ensure a smooth transition when the Obama administration took over. The Post reported his last day would likely be Friday. Herb Allison, who has been chief executive of Fannie Mae since it was seized by the government in September, has been tapped to take over the position and is awaiting confirmation by the U.S. Senate.
