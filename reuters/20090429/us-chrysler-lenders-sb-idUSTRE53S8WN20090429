 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Three fund management companies that have Chrysler LLC's secured debt were holding out against the automaker's proposed restructuring terms as of Wednesday afternoon, two people briefed on the closed-door negotiations said. 

 Oppenheimer Funds, Perella Weinberg Partners and Stairway Capital were unprepared to accept the U.S. Treasury's offer of $2 billion in cash to extinguish $6.9 billion in secured debt, said the sources, who asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak to the press. Representatives of the three institutions could not be immediately reached for comment. Chrysler's lenders and U.S. officials were meeting Wednesday afternoon and expected to continue discussions in a bid to win wider support for the government's offer, those briefed on the matter said. Chrysler's main bank lenders -- JPMorgan Chase & Co, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc -- have agreed to the Treasury's offer. All the banks received U.S. taxpayer money as part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program. About 45 financial institutions hold Chrysler's secured debt and failure to win their support would send the automaker into bankruptcy, officials have said. The three hold-outs hoping for a better deal are part of a steering committee representing Chrysler's lenders. The position of Elliott Management, the fourth fund management institution on the committee, was unclear. Some funds argued that Chrysler's secured debt had to be paid out at a higher return than what was offered to the United Auto Workers union for its unsecured healthcare-related claim. The United Auto Workers union was voting on whether to ratify cost-cutting contract terms that would also halve the remaining cash portion of Chrysler's $10.6-billion obligation to a trust fund for retiree healthcare. Chrysler has been kept afloat with $4 billion in federal loans since the start of the year and could get another $500 million before its month-end restructuring deadline established by the autos task force. The task force, headed by former investment banker Steve Rattner, has said it is willing to invest another $6 billion in Chrysler if the struggling automaker can complete the Fiat alliance and agreements to cut debt and costs with its creditors and major unions (Additional reporting by  Jui Chakravorty  and  John Crawley ; Editing by Phil Berlowitz,  Leslie Gevirtz )
