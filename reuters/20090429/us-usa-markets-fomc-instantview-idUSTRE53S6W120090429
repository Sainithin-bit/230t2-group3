 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve on Wednesday said the pace of deterioration in the U.S. economy appeared to be slowing, but said it would continue to keep interest rates exceptionally low for an extended period. 

 KEY POINTS: * Wrapping up a two-day policy meeting, the central bank said it had decided to hold benchmark overnight interest rates in the zero to 0.25 percent range they reached in December. * After their last meeting on March 17-18, Fed officials had offered no hint the recession was abating and they announced plans to pump an additional $1.15 trillion into the economy. * On Wednesday, no new policy actions were announced. COMMENTS: MARK VITNER, ECONOMIST, WACHOVIA SECURITIES, CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA: "No real surprises from the Fed. They acknowledged what we have seen in the recent economic data, that we are not likely to see a repeat of the huge declines in GDP that we did in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. The recession is still with us, the Fed still needs to be vigilant and to pull out all the stops and to provide all the liquidity that they can. It seems to me the change that the economy has gone from being in a freefall and is now on the road to recovery." GREG SALVAGGIO, VICE PRESIDENT FOR TRADING, TEMPUS CONSULTING,  WASHINGTON D.C.: "The tone seemed to have been a bit more optimistic than in the previous meetings. They are noting modest signs of improvement and will keep the target at the present levels, as expected. For the currency markets, the Fed's statement seems to be helping the dollar a bit, in particular against the yen. As for the dollar versus the euro, much of its drop earlier today was on the back of expectations the Fed was going to announce further purchases of Treasuries. Since that didn't happen, the dollar is making a come back and the euro is trading again below 1.33."
