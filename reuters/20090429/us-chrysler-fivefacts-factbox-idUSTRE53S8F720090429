 (Reuters) - Chrysler LLC, the No. 3 U.S. based automaker, nears an April 30 deadline to complete a debt restructuring and cement an alliance with Italy's Fiat SpA . 

 Chrysler, about 80 percent controlled by Cerberus Capital Management, has been operating under $4 billion of emergency U.S. government loans since the start of 2009 under its second bailout. The first bailout provided Chrysler with $1.5 billion of loan guarantees in 1980. Walter P. Chrysler established Chrysler Corp in 1925 and three years later laid the cornerstone for the Chrysler Building, briefly the world's tallest building and still an unmistakable silhouette on the New York skyline. The following are five facts about Auburn Hills, Michigan-based Chrysler. * OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE: Cerberus Capital Management acquired an 80.1 percent stake in Chrysler in 2007 from Daimler AG, which retained 19.9 percent.
