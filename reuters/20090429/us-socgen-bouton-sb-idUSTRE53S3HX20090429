January 28 - Paris prosecutor says Kerviel admitted hiding his activities from superiors but added that Kerviel had said other traders played fast and loose with bank rules. -- The prosecutor reveals that in November 2007, the Eurex exchange alerted SocGen to suspicions it had concerning Kerviel. -- Kerviel is released under judicial supervision. January 30 - A SocGen board meeting decides that chief Daniel Bouton and his deputy Philippe Citerne should stay on. -- Bouton appears on France 2 evening news saying the bank has enough capital to stay independent.
