 CHARLOTTE, North Carolina  (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp shareholders have voted to elect all 18 of the bank's nominees for director, including embattled Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis, by a "clear margin," a source familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. 

 A Bank of America spokesman said it expects to release full results of the annual meeting vote later on Wednesday. The largest U.S. bank by assets said it will abide by any shareholder vote appointing an independent chairman at the bank -- effectively stripping Lewis of that title -- if the majority of shareholders vote for it.
