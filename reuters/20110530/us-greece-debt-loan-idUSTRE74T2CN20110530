 (Reuters) - European Union and IMF officials are expected to deliver their verdict this week on Greece's drive to bring its budget deficit under control. 

 Greece unveiled a series of privatizations last week, part of a goal to raise 50 billion euros by 2015 to pay down its debt mountain as it tries to secure the next tranche of a 110 billion euro EU/IMF bailout. Here are coming events as Greece works to secure the loan: * SATURDAY, JUNE 4: -- Public sector union ADEDY holds rally to protest against new austerity measures announced by the government, at Klathmonos square. -- ADEDY also says it will stage a 24-hour strike later in June to protest against the austerity measures and privatisations. * WEDNESDAY, JUNE 8: -- March unemployment data. * FRIDAY, JUNE 10: -- Debt agency sets amount of 6-month T-bills to be auctioned on June 14. * WEDNESDAY, JUNE 15: -- Workers at state firms slated for privatisation, plan a 24-hour strike. * MONDAY, JUNE 20: -- Eurogroup meeting of euro zone finance ministers and Ecofin meeting of EU finance ministers in Luxembourg. * THURSDAY, JUNE 23-FRIDAY JUNE 24: -- Summit of EU heads of state and government in Brussels. * FRIDAY, JULY 15: -- Six-month T-bills, worth 2.4 billion euros mature on this date. * FRIDAY JULY 22: -- Three months T-bills worth 2 billion euros mature on this date. * SATURDAY, AUGUST 20: -- A 5.9 billion euro, 5-year bond matures on this date. * NO SPECIFIC DATES: -- The EU/IMF bailout plan says the fifth, 12 billion euro aid installment is set to be disbursed in June but government officials have said that Greece has enough cash to cover its needs until mid-July. -- One obstacle to the fifth disbursement is the IMF's refusal to release its share of the money unless the euro zone commits to new aid for Athens to fill a 27 billion euro funding gap in 2012. -- The government has said it will submit a mid-term fiscal plan to parliament in early June.
