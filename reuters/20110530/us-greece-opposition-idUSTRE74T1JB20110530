 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Greek conservative opposition leader Antonis Samaras said on Monday that lower tax rates were a precondition for consensus talks with the government on further austerity measures. 

 Socialist Prime Minister George Papandreou is seeking a broad political consensus on the measures to tackle Greece's debt crisis, a major condition for extra EU aid. "Lower tax rates are the key to starting the engine of the Greek economy," Samaras told his parliamentary group.
