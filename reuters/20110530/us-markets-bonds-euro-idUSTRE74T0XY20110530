 LONDON  (Reuters) - Greek government bond yields rose on Monday, with uncertainty over whether the country will receive its vital aid tranche from the International Monetary Fund and the European Union hurting sentiment in illiquid trade. 

 "The market is extremely illiquid, there is no flow behind the move, screens are marked defensively," one trader said. "Probably politicians will find a solution, but even if they may be successful this time, nothing can be a game changer." "Greece will eventually have to restructure its debt." The Greek/German ten-year bond yield spread was last 20 basis points higher on the day to 1,387 bps. Two-year yields were up 58 bps, to 26.23 percent.
