 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Greek conservative opposition leader Antonis Samaras said on Monday that he saw no scope for a consensus deal on further austerity measures if the Socialist government raises taxes. 

 Socialist Prime Minister George Papandreou is seeking a broad political consensus on the measures to tackle Greece's debt crisis, a key condition for extra EU aid. But the New Democracy party which Samaras leads says higher taxes would stifle the Greek economy even further and budget deficit targets must be reached by spending cuts. "If you raise taxes, there will be no room for consensus or for renegotiation," Samaras told New Democracy members of parliament. (Reporting by Harry Papachristou; Writing by  David Stamp )
