 (Reuters) - Costco Wholesale Corp reported a better-than-expected 8 percent increase in January same-store sales, helped by a weak dollar and higher gasoline prices. 

 Analysts, on average, were expecting a rise 7.8 percent in January same-store sales, including the impact of fuel prices and foreign exchange, according to Thomson Reuters data. Same-store sales at U.S. locations rose 4 percent, while its international division sales surged 25 percent, the company said. January net sales rose 10 percent to $5.62 billion. Excluding the impact of gasoline prices and foreign exchange, the company said U.S. comparable sales were flat, while on a local currency basis, international same-store sales rose 9 percent.
