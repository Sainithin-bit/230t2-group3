 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - New orders at U.S. factories jumped by an unexpectedly large 1 percent in December despite a drop in transportation equipment orders, while inventories shrank. 

 KEY POINTS: * Analysts polled by Reuters were expecting orders to increase by 0.5 percent. Factory orders for November were revised up to a 1 percent gain. * Transportation orders fell by 0.5 percent on a 34.1 percent drop in civilian aircraft orders. Excluding transportation, new orders rose 1.2 percent in the month. * Inventories fell for the first time in three months, dipping 0.1 percent. The inventories-to-shipments ratio slipped to 1.29, the lowest since August 2008. COMMENTS: MATT LLOYD, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, ADVISORS ASSET MANAGEMENT, MONUMENT, COLORADO: "It's a pretty profound number, but it's just continuing a bounce off of a 10-year low. "It isn't that surprising (since) we've seen this increase over the past four months. "The number shows that there is enough strength to carry this economy into the next stage, but at some point the baton will be passed to the consumer, maybe in the second half of this year." WARD McCARTHY, CHIEF FINANCIAL ECONOMIST, MANAGING DIRECTOR, FIXED INCOME DIVISION, JEFFERIES & CO., NEW YORK: "Orders were pretty strong. Healthy. There was a significant upward revision to durable goods orders, more than the market was expecting. It looks like the strength was pretty broad-based. It gives us reason to expect the manufacturing sector will continue to power up." KURT KARL, CHIEF U.S. ECONOMIST, SWISS RE, NEW YORK "This is solid news on orders for the manufacturing sector as a whole with a lot of support from non-durables. We are looking at a solid manufacturing recovery. "We should look at some bounce back in employment in the manufacturing sector with this kind of a recovery." JOE SALUZZI, CO-MANAGER OF TRADING, THEMIS TRADING, CHATHAM, NEW JERSEY: "It's good news anytime when you get a better-than-expected number. But it's not a game changer. You've got a lot of big issues that tend to get overlooked on days like yesterday and the day before, but they are not going away. And the biggest one this morning was that weekly jobless claims number. "You are in the basement, you've got to eventually climb up the stairs. We're not climbing, we're staying down the stairs. You look at the more global macro-economic picture, nothing has really changed in housing or unemployment in the last year. These issues will come back to haunt you." DAN COOK, SENIOR MARKET ANALYST, IG MARKETS, CHICAGO: "The factory orders has been consistent with last month, and really it's been the only bright spot pretty much around the world today. (There are) a lot of fears and I think the factory orders are going to be overruled by that initial jobless claims at 480,000; we've already had debt fears out of Greece which really hurt the equity markets, and we've got Portugal - the insurance on their debt rising to all time highs." MICHAEL MORAN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, DAIWA SECURITIES AMERICA, NEW YORK: "It's a good solid report with reasonable gains in both durable and non-durable goods. "We had a nice upward revision in the durable category. It was originally reported +0.3 percent, and now it's actually up 1.0 percent. "The non-durable area was up 1 percent. A good chunk of that was in the petroleum area. Some of that might have been due to higher prices. But there was also a gain in non-durables excluding petroleum -- up 0.5 percent, the fourth consecutive monthly increase in that category." JOSEPH BATTIPAGLIA, MARKET STRATEGIST, STIFEL NICOLAUS, YARDLEY, PENNSYLVANIA: "The number is consistent with the quarterly data we've seen on inventory rebuilding and restocking. It shows a big boost in productivity but doesn't mean that we're off to the races. It begs the question of what kind of absorption rate will we have ahead of us. However, this is a good number and points to continued expansion in manufacturing, though we still have the issue of what demand will look like in the quarters ahead." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stock indexes briefly cut losses. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices were little changed. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar was little changed.
