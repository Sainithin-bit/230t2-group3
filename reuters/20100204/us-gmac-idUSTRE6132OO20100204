 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - GMAC Financial Services, a lender that is majority-owned by the U.S. government after multiple bailouts, lost $5 billion in the fourth quarter after writing down bad mortgage assets. 

 GMAC, one of the largest car loan makers in the United States, said in December it did not expect major losses from its mortgage unit after the fourth quarter. Home loans fueled GMAC's growth earlier this decade, but have since triggered billions of dollars of losses for the company. But even if it has controlled its mortgage losses, questions loom about its future as an independent company, analysts said. GMAC was previously the auto financing unit of General Motors. In 2006, GM sold a controlling stake in the company. As an independent company and now a regulated bank holding company, GMAC has less capacity to take credit risk when lending to car buyers, which could inhibit GM's car sales. The U.S. government owns 61 percent of GM and 56 percent of GMAC. An analyst on the GMAC conference call on Thursday asked if the common ownership has spurred talk of recombining the two companies. GMAC Chief Executive Michael Carpenter said there is no discussion on recombining the companies and added that, as separate companies, financing costs are more explicit instead of amounting to hidden subsidies to a car sale. "In the long term that is actually positive for the auto companies, because it forces them to make an economic decision in a very rigorous way," Carpenter said. GMAC is also the preferred lender for Chrysler car sales and finances dealer inventories. Massive losses combined with the broader credit crunch and General Motors' bankruptcy filing hobbled GMAC, forcing it into the arms of the government and triggering the resignation of Chief Executive Al de Molina. Carpenter, formerly a Citigroup executive, was named new CEO in November and is looking to turn the struggling lender around. The fourth-quarter loss compares with net income of $7.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008. (Reporting by  Dan Wilchins ; editing by John Wallace, Dave Zimmerman and  Andre Grenon )
