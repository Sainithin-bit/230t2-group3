 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - The following are comments by European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet on Thursday after a Governing Council policy meeting at which the bank left its key interest rate unchanged at 1.0 percent. 

 ROLE OF G7, PRIMACY OF G20 "It is important that the industrialized countries have this kind of meditation, taking into account also their responsibilities, including in the recent prices . And we will cover all the usual, I would say, issues that are so important." "But let's not forget, it's been a decision, and I stick to the decision, the prime grouping for the international corporation is the G20. It is no more the G7, at least in this format of ministers and governments." DOES CUTTING LARGE DEFICITS HURT GROWTH? "I don't think so. I mean in terms of sustainable growth and job creation, if you are obviously in a ... very bad situation, say in terms of fiscal policy, then you have no confidence in your country . Then households have no confidence, entrepreneurs have no confidence, and you cannot expect a recovery, which would be satisfactory. So you have to be credible in your medium-term path toward sustainability for the fiscal policy." GERMANY "I think what we can say is that this country has protected itself in the very difficult situation where we were all put, particularly on the front of employment, in a way which is quite impressive." ESTONIAN EURO ADOPTION "We have the criteria, which have to be met, and we have also the treaty obligation that these criteria have to be met, not only at the moment of the examination, but also on a sustainable basis. That is what is absolutely essential, always has been essential in the eyes of the Governing Council, that the criteria are met, not only today, but on a sustainable basis." EURO ZONE VS OTHER COUNTRIES "(The euro zone is) in a situation, which compares, I have to say, very flatteringly with a number of other countries, industrial countries." FOREX "I appreciate enormously that the US authorities are saying themselves that a strong dollar, vis-a-vis the other major floating currencies, is in the interest of the United States of America . And I trust that it is in the interest of the United States of America, as well as in the interest of the rest of the world, including Europe." HOW EURO ZONE HELP WORKS "In the euro area, there is very often a misunderstanding. A lot of people are imagining that (when) you have ... problems, you have help and conditionality with the help, which is the normal case for a country in ... the rest of the world. "In the euro area, it's very different. You have ex ante (help) and not ex post. Because you're in the euro area, then you have an automatic financing of your current account deficit and you could see that functioning extremely well ... over years. "Very easy financing of the current account deficit ... is the kind of help that is given by international institutions, but it is given ex ante in our case and the conditionality is also ex ante." IMPORTANCE OF STABILITY AND GROWTH PACT "It is a very, very strong call for having full respect of the Stability and Growth Pact, full respect of the excessive deficit procedure, and you know that each country has its own goal in terms of going down to below 3% and we consider of course that all this is crucial." GREECE "The ECB Governing Council approves of the medium-term goal that has been fixed by the Greek government... Now, we expect and we are confident that the Greek government will take all the decisions that will permit to reach that goal. In this respect, the measures that were taken last Tuesday, namely the taxation of oil, the freezing of wages in the public sector, and the pension reform, are steps in the right direction." BANKS' CHALLENGES "...the challenge remains for banks to adjust the size and structure of their balance sheets while ensuring the availability of credit to the nonfinancial sector . To address this challenge, banks should use the improved funding conditions to strengthen their capital base further and where necessary take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalization." LOAN DEMAND "Given the typical lags between turning points in economic activity and those in the demand for bank loans, growth in loans can be expected to remain weak over the months to come." DOWNSIDE RISKS TO GROWTH "On the downside, concerns remain relating to a stronger or more protracted than expected negative feedback loop between the real economy and the financial sector; renewed increase in oil and other commodity prices; the intensification of protectionist pressures; and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances." "...stimulus will unwind over time while activity is likely to be adversely affected by the ongoing process of balance sheet adjustments in the financial and nonfinancial sectors, both inside and outside the euro area. "In addition, low capacity utilization rates are likely to dampen investment and unemployment in the euro area is expected to increase somewhat further, thereby lowering consumption growth." MONETARY DEVELOPMENTS "Actual monetary developments are likely to be weaker than the underlying pace of monetary expansion owing to the downward impact of the rather steep yield curve." GROWTH OUTLOOK "The Governing Council expects the euro area economy to grow at a moderate pace in 2010. The recovery process is likely to be uneven and the outlook remains subject to uncertainty. "The Governing Council continues to view the risks to this (economic) outlook as broadly balanced." INFLATION EXPECTATIONS "The outcome of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressure over the medium term. "Medium to longer-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council's aim at keeping inflation rates below, but close to 2% over the medium term." "I consider that we are in a period where we had the worst recession since World War II, and the inflation expectations that we are looking at as the pertinent indicators are confirming that we are at the level of 1.9%. It is not a secret. I can tell you that the next survey of official forecasters will give us for five years 1.9%, which is the confirmation of this solid anchoring of inflation expectations." INTEREST RATES "Based on its regular economic and monetary analysis, the Governing Council decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The current rates remain appropriate."
