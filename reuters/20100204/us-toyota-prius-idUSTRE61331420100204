 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp has reworked its anti-lock brake system to fix the brake issue on its Prius gas-electric hybrid cars, a senior official in charge of quality issues said on Thursday. 

 Toyota called a briefing after news that it had received close to 100 complaints, mostly in Japan, concerning what drivers characterised as insufficient braking in the third-generation Prius hybrid model. The Prius is now Japan's top-selling model -- a first for a gasoline-electric car. (Reporting by  Chang-Ran Kim )
