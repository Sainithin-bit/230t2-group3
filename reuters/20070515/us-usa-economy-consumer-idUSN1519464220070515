 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Never bet against the U.S. consumer, even when gasoline prices are rising, the housing market is slumping and retail sales figures look ugly. 

 That old investing cliche is certainly in for a tough test, but some on Wall Street see reason for optimism in rebounding May sales and point to a solid job market and income growth as signs that spending won't stall. "Even amidst a housing slowdown, the consumer balance sheet remains strong," said Deborah Weinswig, retail analyst with Citigroup. The home sales pace slid in 33 U.S. states in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2006, the National Association of Realtors said on Tuesday. The national price for gasoline hit a record $3.10 per gallon this week, marking the third consecutive year that prices have topped $3, straining household budgets. Tom Schoewe, chief financial officer of retailing juggernaut Wal-Mart Stores Inc., said shoppers were clearly feeling the pain at the gas pump. "Every single time they pull in to fill up their tank, that's pulling disposable income out of their pocket," Schoewe told Reuters on Tuesday. "For a customer who's living paycheck to paycheck -- that's an important customer for us -- that clearly has an impact on our business." But dig through recent sales and earnings reports from the top retailers and there are some glimmers of hope as May brings more seasonable weather to much of the United States after an unusually cold, stormy April. SILVER LINING Wal-Mart, the world's biggest retailer, forecast 1 percent to 2 percent growth in May sales at its U.S. stores open at least a year. That may not sound very impressive, but it would be a marked improvement from last month, when same-store sales fell 3.5 percent, the worst performance since Wal-Mart began reporting that data in 1979. Wal-Mart and the second-largest U.S. retailer, Home Depot Inc., both reported first-quarter earnings on Tuesday that reflected poor spring sales, and they gave less-than-rosy profit forecasts. "If there is a silver lining, we believe sales trends picked up in May as better weather arrived," Credit Suisse analyst Gary Balter said, referring to Home Depot. Some 80 percent of major U.S. retailers reported April sales last week that fell short of analysts' expectations. The Commerce Department said on Friday that sales for the month declined 0.2 percent, missing economists' forecasts. Many chain stores blamed inhospitable weather and the timing of Easter, which landed in the March sales reporting period instead of April. Weather and calendars aside, consumers do appear to be cutting back on some discretionary purchases, particularly lower-income shoppers at discount stores like Wal-Mart. The retailer said sales of food outstripped demand for general merchandise such as clothing and home decor. Merrill Lynch economist David Rosenberg, who has a bearish view on the U.S. economy, divides retailers into two categories: those that sell consumer staples, such as drug stores and grocery stores, and cyclical sectors like autos, electronics, clothing, building materials and furniture. The staples segment showed solid growth last month, while the cyclical sectors showed the largest decline in nearly a year. "No matter how you slice it, the consumer is clearly pressing the fatigue button," said Rosenberg. "And this wasn't just Easter timing or the weather because that was even worse than the already lowered number the (analysts) were looking for." The question is, was April an anomaly or an omen? May's sales results should provide more clarity because retailers won't have Easter or snowstorms to use as excuses. So far, things look a bit more promising.
