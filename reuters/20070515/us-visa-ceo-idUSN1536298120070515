 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Visa is expected to name credit-card industry veteran Joseph Saunders to head the company as it prepares to go public next year, the Wall Street Journal reported on its Web site on Tuesday. 

 Visa is expected to name Saunders as chief executive and chairman on Tuesday of what will eventually be known as Visa Inc., the Journal reported. In February, Visa named Saunders as executive chairman to help restructure the company, including finding board members and naming a new chief executive at the world's largest credit card payment system. Saunders was earlier president of card service at Washington Mutual Inc ( WM.N ). He was also chief executive at Providian Financial, which Washington Mutual bought, and has held senior positions at Fleet Credit Card Services and Household International. Visa said in October that it planned an initial public offering to fund its expansion and help pay legal costs. A Visa spokesperson could not immediately be reached for comment.
