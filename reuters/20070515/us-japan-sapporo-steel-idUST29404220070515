 TOKYO  (Reuters) - U.S. hedge fund Steel Partners called Japanese beermaker Sapporo Holdings Ltd's ( 2501.T ) questions regarding the fund's takeover approach a delaying tactic on Tuesday. 

 Steel Partners said in February it may launch a tender offer to raise its stake to two-thirds from 18.64 percent. As part of its anti-takeover defense Sapporo can ask questions about Steel Partners' intentions. If the answers are unsatisfactory Sapporo may be able to activate its poison pill. Sapporo has crafted its takeover defenses based on guidelines put together by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. Analysts said there is no limit on how many times it can ask for additional information. It can also make the answers public. The brewer asked Steel Partners in March for more details on the past activities of Steel Partners and its co-holders, the purpose and method of its tender offer, the basis for calculating its offer price and how it plans to procure funds. It also asked about its plans for management strategy and dealing with relevant stakeholders such as customers and business partners. Shares in Sapporo closed on Tuesday 0.47 percent lower at 845 yen, outperforming a 0.93 percent drop in the benchmark Nikkei average  .N225 , and still above Steel Partners' estimate of its potential offer price of 825 yen. The fund's unit Steel Partners Japan Strategic Fund (Offshore), L.P. said in a letter to Sapporo's management that many of the beermaker's questions are not relevant to shareholders' interests in light of the fund's offer to acquire 66.6 percent of the voting rights in the company. The letter said the questions were inappropriate and too broad and suggested the true purpose of the questions was to create a back-and-forth of unanswerable questions that would delay for an indefinite period of time the ability of Sapporo's shareholders to consider the fund's proposal. The fund reiterated its desire to sit down with the company's management at the earliest possible date to hold discussions on a friendly basis related to its offer. Steel Partners replied to Sapporo's questions with qualified answers and Sapporo has not entered into a mutual confidentiality agreement with Sapporo. Sapporo's board of directors have 60 days, which can be extended to 90 days, in which to review the information gathered and come up with a recommendation to shareholders, analysts said. Sapporo's poison pill can only be triggered if the takeover bidder has not abided by the rules for large acquisitions and if the takeover is judged to be clearly for abusive purposes.
