 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Beckman Coulter Inc. BEC.N said on Monday it will not increase its offer to buy Biosite Inc. BSTE.O for $90 per share, after Biosite's board said it considered a competing takeover bid as superior. 

 The decision is set to end a takeover battle between Beckman and Inverness Medical Innovations Inc. IMA.A for Biosite, which makes diagnostic tests for heart conditions and other diseases. The board of Biosite told Beckman that it considered a $92.50 per share bid by Inverness, which makes home pregnancy tests and fertility monitoring kits, as superior, Beckman said. Beckman, which makes genetic analysis testing systems, said it believed that the long-term interests of its shareholders would not be served by increasing its bid. Fullerton, California-based Beckman, which also makes medical instruments, said it expects Biosite will end their existing merger agreement and pay it a termination fee of $54 million. Biosite said in a separate statement that Inverness had agreed to pay the termination fee. Beckman and Biosite had originally entered into a merger agreement in March, when Beckman offered to buy Biosite for $85 a share in cash. But Inverness offered to buy all the outstanding shares of Biosite common stock that it did not already own for $90 per share in cash. Beckman Coulter matched that bid, only to be topped by a $92.50 per share offer from Inverness.
