 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Consumer prices rose less than expected in April, according to a government report on Tuesday that offered some signs inflation pressures may be easing. 

 The Labor Department's Consumer Price Index advanced 0.4 percent in April, slightly less than Wall Street expected and below the 0.6 percent rise in March. The core rate, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, increased 0.2 percent. While that marked a slight step up from March, the 12-month increase in core prices slipped to 2.3 percent, the smallest gain in a year. Analysts said this latest reading suggested the Federal Reserve's efforts to tame inflation may be working, even though medical costs bounced back up and food and energy prices continued to rise. "This only reinforces the view that the Fed is on hold and that inflation remains contained," said Alex Beuzelin, senior market analyst, Ruesch International. Since June of last year, the Fed has kept benchmark overnight interest rates steady, but has continued to warn about inflation risks. Stock prices rose, with the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average up over 70 points in afternoon trades, as the report was seen as providing scope for potential Fed rate cuts later in the year. Prices for government bonds initially rose on the report but later gave up their gains to stocks, while the dollar declined against the euro. MANUFACTURING PICTURE IMPROVING? A separate report from the New York Federal Reserve Bank showed factory activity in New York rose in May. The Empire State general business conditions index rose to 8.03 in May from 3.80 in April, slightly exceeding Wall Street forecasts. "We are seeing a gradual improvement in the factory sector with the bloated inventories at the beginning of the year coming down," said Richard DeKaser, chief economist at National City Corp. in Cleveland. However, home builder confidence sank in May as lenders made it more difficult for borrowers to qualify for mortgages and order cancellations mounted, according to the National Association of Home Builders. "It seems to mirror this ongoing turmoil in the subprime market as well as the ever-tightening lending standards," said William O'Donnell, head of U.S. rate strategy at UBS in Stamford, Connecticut. During the first four months of this year, the overall CPI rose at a 4.8 percent annual rate. That compares with an increase of 2.5 percent for all of 2006. But price advances were more moderate excluding food and energy, with the core rate advancing at just a 2.2 percent rate during the first four months, after rising 2.6 percent in 2006. "The acceleration thus far this year was due to larger increases in the energy and food components," the Labor Department said. Food prices advanced 0.4 percent last month, while energy rose 2.4 percent. For the first four months of this year, food and energy rose at a 6.7 percent and 25.3 percent annual rates, respectively. Since the beginning of this year, gasoline prices have risen 43 percent. According to government data, the national average pump price hit a record $3.10 per gallon this week due to strong gasoline demand, fewer-than-normal imports and a drop in inventories that reflected the shutdown of refineries. These pump prices have helped cut into consumer spending power. The Labor Department said weekly earnings, after adjustment for inflation, dropped by 0.5 percent in April, the biggest decline in nearly a year. Separate reports tracking sales at chain stores, which have been under pressure recently weeks, rose, showing some signs of consumer resilience.
