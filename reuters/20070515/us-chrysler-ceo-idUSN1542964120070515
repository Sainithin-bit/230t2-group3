 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Chrysler Group DCXGn.DEDCX.N Chief Executive Tom LaSorda said on Tuesday that the automaker's three brands, Jeep, Chrysler and Dodge, will not be broken up after its sale to Cerberus Capital Management. 

 "These brands will not be broken up under any circumstances," LaSorda told reporters, a day after German parent DaimlerChrysler AG announced the sale of most of its stake in Chrysler to Cerberus Capital Management. The CEO also said Cerberus has endorsed the current product plan and investment in plants. "The product plan is set," LaSorda said.
