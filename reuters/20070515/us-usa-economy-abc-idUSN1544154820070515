 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Consumers are becoming gloomier as rising gasoline prices stretch household budgets thin, according to a weekly survey. 

 The ABC News/Washington Post Consumer Comfort Index dropped to -7 from -3 in the latest week, an unusually sharp one-week decline and a level matching a low for this year. "Fifty-five percent now say the economy is getting worse -- an enormous 21 points higher than the level of pessimism before the current run-up in gas prices began," the two news organizations said in a statement. The national average price for regular unleaded gasoline hit a record $3.10 per gallon this week amid strong demand and dwindling stockpiles. Confidence measures are generally viewed as a barometer of consumer spending, although the correlation is not always airtight.
