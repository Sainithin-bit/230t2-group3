 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc. ( CSCO.O ) will likely make as many acquisitions this year as it did in 2006, Chief Development Officer Charles Giancarlo said on Tuesday. 

 "The temperature feels about the same," Giancarlo said at the Reuters Global Technology, Media and Telecoms Summit in New York, when asked to compare the network equipment maker's acquisition spending this year with 2006. "If history's a guide, about the same," he said. Last year, Cisco announced around 10 deals, including its $92 million acquisition of video-on-demand software maker Arroyo Video. It also closed its purchase of cable set-top box maker Scientific Atlanta, which was announced in 2005. (For summit blog:  summitnotebook.reuters.com/ )
