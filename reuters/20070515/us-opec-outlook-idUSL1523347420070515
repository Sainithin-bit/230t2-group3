 LONDON  (Reuters) - Crude oil inventories are more than enough to cover fuel demand during the peak summer travel season, OPEC said on Tuesday, rebuffing calls from consumers for more supply. 

 The monthly oil market report from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries also showed members keeping a lid on output, a policy OPEC officials say may extend beyond their next meeting on September 11. "Heading into the driving season, crude oil stocks are more than adequate to meet expected demand. However, gasoline stocks are low for this time of year," OPEC's report said. "As always, OPEC continues to monitor market developments ahead of its planned meeting in September, which will focus on the coming winter season." The outlook from OPEC follows a call on Friday from the International Energy Agency for the group to boost output before summer, when gasoline demand rises as U.S. motorists take to the road for holidays. Oil prices LCOc1 have risen to above $66 a barrel from about $50 in January, worrying consumers, in part due to lower OPEC supply, violence in Nigeria and a drop in inventories of gasoline in the U.S. The IEA, adviser to 26 industrialized nations, said gasoline supplies in top consumer the United States have sunk to a 16-year low for the time of year, pushing pump prices above $3 a gallon to near-record levels. Its head warned on Tuesday of a supply crunch without more crude oil from OPEC, whose 12 member-countries meet more than a third of demand in the 85.4 million barrels per day world market. "We do not see a balanced market if there is no production increase from the OPEC probably before the summer," IEA Executive Director Claude Mandil said in Paris. GASOLINE IMPORTS The report by economists at OPEC's Vienna headquarters said rising gasoline imports by the United States would ease concern about fuel supplies. OPEC's top research official said the return of oil refineries from maintenance would also help boost fuel stocks and cast doubt on whether OPEC would need to pump more crude. "It's too early to tell, but as far as I can tell I don't think there is a need to change anything in September," Hasan Qabazard, head of OPEC's research division, told Reuters. "We maintain our position there is plenty of crude in the market. Gasoline stocks are expected to recover as refinery turnarounds come to conclusion." OPEC in its report left expected global growth in oil demand in 2007 steady at 1.3 million bpd, or 1.5 percent. It put 2007 demand for OPEC crude at 30.33 million bpd, up from 30.28 million bpd previously expected, reflecting lower-than-expected supply from non-member countries. Oil ministers from OPEC opted to maintain supplies at a meeting in March. At their two previous meetings, they agreed to curb output by 1.7 million bpd, roughly six percent. Industry estimates show that OPEC has delivered on about 1 million bpd of the pledged cutback. Tuesday's report showed little change in supplies. The 10 OPEC members, all excluding Iraq and Angola, bound by production cut deals pumped 26.448 million bpd in April, up 31,000 bpd from March, the report said, citing data from secondary sources.
