 BEIJING  (Reuters) - Friction between China and the United States is unavoidable amid rapidly growing economic ties, a Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman said on Tuesday, but added Beijing hopes tensions can be resolved through dialogue. 

 The two countries are holding a second round of a so-called strategic economic dialogue this month in Washington, covering investment policy, policy transparency, balanced growth, energy and the environment. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu said some problems were bound to arise. "We believe the mainstream of China-U.S. economic relations is mutually beneficial," she told a news conference, adding that Vice-Premier Wu Yi would lead the delegation of officials to the May 22-23 talks. "We hope that both sides can effectively resolve related problems through frank dialogue and consultation on an equal basis and with a reasonable attitude." In a fact sheet released at the end of the inaugural round of the strategic economic dialogue in December, China said it would pursue currency exchange-rate reform while the United States would aim to boost national savings in a drive to promote balanced growth. Asked about exchange-rate policy, Jiang said China would continue exchange rate reform in a "proactive" and "constructive" way. U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson is being pushed by members of Congress to urge China to let its currency rise in value in hopes that will slow imports. But Beijing has said it cannot move faster for fear of destabilizing its economy. U.S. anger over its huge trade deficit with China, which hit a record $233 billion last year, has spurred demands for a tougher response to Chinese government subsidies, which many U.S. lawmakers believe boost Chinese exports unfairly.
