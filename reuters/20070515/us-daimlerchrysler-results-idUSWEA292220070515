 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - DaimlerChrysler DCXGn.DE posted first-quarter earnings before interest and tax of 2.04 billion euros ($2.76 billion), handily beating market expectations, as rising profit at its Mercedes Car Group offset another big loss at Chrysler Group. 

 It forecast on Tuesday that 2007 EBIT would rise to 7 billion euros excluding the impact from selling its Chrysler arm, giving its first detailed outlook for 2007. Analysts polled by Reuters had on average expected EBIT of 1.545 billion euros in the three months to end-March. The world's fifth-biggest carmaker, which announced on Monday it was selling a majority stake in Chrysler to private equity group Cerberus Capital Management CBS.UL, was reporting under IFRS accounting standards for the first time.
