 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Home Depot Inc. ( HD.N ), the world's largest home improvement chain, posted lower-than-expected first-quarter profit on Tuesday as the softer housing market and cooler temperatures hurt sales. 

 Home Depot said sales trends had improved in the last week as spring weather arrived and added it was making good on efforts to improve stores and boost morale. Its shares were off 1 percent in late afternoon trading, improving from a drop of as much as 2.5 percent earlier in the session. "It's a tough housing market," said Joseph Feldman, senior research analyst at Telsey Advisory Group, an independent research firm. Home Depot "is seeing some improvements with the initiatives they have in place, but it's a turnaround story." Home Depot said it expected per-share profit for this year to fall as much as 9 percent. Earnings declined by 30 percent to $1 billion, or 53 cents a share, in the first quarter ended on April 29, from $1.5 billion, or 70 cents, a year earlier. Analysts on average expected profit of 59 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose less than 1 percent to $21.6 billion, shy of the analysts' average estimate of $21.78 billion. Retail store sales fell 4.3 percent to $18.5 billion, while sales in the supply segment geared to professional contractors rose 46 percent to $3.1 billion, aided by acquisitions. Home Depot said it was still reviewing options, including a possible sale, for the supply unit that provides building materials and other products to contractors. At retail stores, which account for 86 percent of Home Depot's total sales and 92 percent of operating income, the average purchase fell 2.9 percent to $59.01 as consumers took on fewer big-ticket projects such as kitchen remodels. Sales at stores open at least a year, an important retail measure, fell 7.6 percent. Home Depot said colder temperatures in April and weakness in traditionally strong markets such as Florida hurt results in the quarter, but added that sales trends had improved with the arrival of better weather. Home Depot and smaller rival Lowe's Cos. ( LOW.N ) have seen their earnings weaken as lower home sales and construction and rising foreclosures pressure the housing market. "Until we can see a turnaround, Home Depot has to focus on the cost side and improve store performance, including customer service," said Bill Schultz, chief investment officer for McQueen, Ball & Associates. Frank Blake, named chief executive when Robert Nardelli stepped down in January, and other executives said Home Depot made progress in store upkeep and staffing, was improving business with professional customers and hiring certified workers in areas such as plumbing. The company is boosting capital spending by 29 percent this year. "The associates feel good about themselves and about the company, and that translates into a better customer experience," said Carol Tome, chief financial officer. The chain said it had gained market share in categories such as appliances, power tools and landscaping products, but was continuing to lose share in bath. Home Depot shares were down 38 cents to $38.63 in late afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, while Lowe's eased 1 cent to $30.98. Home Depot's stock has fallen 3.6 percent so far this year, while Lowe's is down slightly.
