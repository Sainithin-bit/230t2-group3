 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ), reported an 8.1 percent rise in first-quarter profit on Tuesday, but the world's largest retailer forecast second-quarter earnings that could miss current Wall Street targets. 

 "While these are record sales and earnings, we feel there was an opportunity to have done better," said Lee Scott, Wal-Mart president and chief executive, in a statement. Earnings rose to $2.83 billion, or 68 cents per share, in the first quarter that ended April 30, from $2.62 billion, or 63 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had been expecting profit of 68 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 8.3 percent to $85.387 billion. But Wal-Mart forecast earnings per share continuing operations between 75 cents to 79 cents for its fiscal second-quarter. Analysts, on average, had been expecting it to earn 79 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Wal-Mart is working to revive sales at its U.S. stores after merchandising missteps -- like overexpanding its Metro 7 line of fashion apparel -- hurt results. Its base of low-income shoppers is also facing higher gasoline prices and a slowing housing market. Wal-Mart's April same-store sales -- a key gauge that measures sales at its U.S. stores open at least a year -- fell 3.5 percent, the largest decline since the retailer began reporting such numbers in 1979. After downplaying its discount roots last year to try to sell more goods to affluent shoppers, Wal-Mart is now reemphasizing its low prices. "We're not satisfied with our overall performance," Scott said on a recorded call. He added that the retailer will be "more committed than ever" to price leadership. Its shares have risen 3.6 percent this year through Monday, while close rival Target Corp. ( TGT.N ) is up almost 2 percent and the S&P Retail Index .RLX is up 3 percent.
