 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Consumer prices advanced 0.4 percent in April on a continued rise in energy and food prices, but price gains elsewhere were muted helping to paint a somewhat stable inflation picture, a government report on Tuesday showed. 

 Wall Street economists polled before the Labor Department report were expecting the Consumer Price Index to advance 0.5 percent. The core rate, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, advanced 0.2 percent in April. That was directly in line with expectations. The dollar slipped against the euro in reaction to the April core CPI advance and U.S. Treasury prices were up after a lower-than-expected rise in the core CPI from the same time a year ago. The 2.3 percent year-on-year rise in core CPI is the smallest in a year. "This only reinforces the view that the Fed is on hold and that inflation remains contained," said Alex Beuzelin, senior market analyst, Ruesch International. Since June of last year, the Federal Reserve has opted to keep its benchmark federal funds interest rate unchanged. U.S. stock futures pared losses. On the manufacturing front, activity in New York rose in May, according to a separate report from the New York Federal Reserve Bank. The Empire State general business conditions index surged to 8.03 in May from 3.80 in April and slightly exceeded Wall Street Expectations. "We are seeing a gradual improvement in the factory sector with the bloated inventories at the beginning of the year coming down," said Richard DeKaser, chief economist at National City Corp. in Cleveland. HIGHER FOOD AND ENERGY During the first four months of this year, the overall CPI rose at a 4.8 percent seasonally adjusted annual rate. That compares with an increase of 2.5 percent for all of 2006. But price advances were more moderate excluding food and energy, with the core rate advancing at just a 2.2 percent rate during the first four months, after rising 2.6 percent in 2006. "The acceleration thus far this year was due to larger increases in the energy and food components," the Labor Department said. Food prices advanced 0.4 percent last month, while energy rose 2.4 percent. For the first four months of this year food and energy rose at a 6.7 percent and 25.3 percent annual rate, respectively. Higher prices for food and gasoline helped bring down weekly earnings, after adjustment for inflation, by 0.5 percent in April, the biggest monthly decline in nearly a year. In a separate report, the International Council of Shopping Centers and UBS Securities said sales at U.S. chain stores, which have been under pressure in recent weeks, rose 0.8 percent last week.
