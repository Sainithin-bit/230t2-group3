 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ), the world's largest retailer, reported higher quarterly profit on Tuesday, helped by strength in its international business. 

 Earnings rose to $2.83 billion, or 68 cents per share, in the first quarter that ended April 30, from $2.62 billion, or 63 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had been expecting profit of 68 cents per share, excluding items, according to Reuters Estimates. Wal-Mart is working to revive sales at its U.S. stores after merchandising missteps -- like overexpanding its Metro 7 line of fashion apparel -- hurt sales. After downplaying its discount roots last year to try to sell more goods to affluent shoppers, it is now reemphasizing its low prices. Its shares have risen 3.6 percent this year through Monday, while close rival Target Corp. ( TGT.N ) is up almost 2 percent and the S&P Retail Index .RLX is up 3 percent.
