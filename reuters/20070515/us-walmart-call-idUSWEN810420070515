 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The chief executive of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) said on Tuesday that he was "not satisfied" with the retailer's quarterly results. 

 CEO Lee Scott, in comments made on a recorded call, said the company was "more committed than ever" to price leadership. Earlier in the day, Wal-Mart reported fiscal first-quarter earnings of 68 cents per share. That was in line with Wall Street targets, but at the low end of the company's own profit forecast of 68 cents to 71 cents. After downplaying its discount roots last year to try to sell more goods to affluent shoppers, Wal-Mart is now reemphasizing its low prices.
