 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - Bank of America ( BAC.N ) has appealed a Dutch commercial court's decision to freeze its $21 billion agreement to buy LaSalle Bank from ABN AMRO AAH.AS, the Dutch Supreme Court said on Tuesday. 

 Bank of America, which has also sued ABN over the frozen deal to buy U.S. midwest bank LaSalle, is arguing that Amsterdam's commercial court overstepped its bounds in suspending a transaction it considers valid. "If we are successful in appealing to the Dutch court, we expect the parties to fulfil the contract," a spokesman for Bank of America said. "The Dutch statute does not require shareholder approval for the sale of LaSalle and we believe the Dutch statute protects the rights of a third party like Bank of America that acted in good faith." ABN was not immediately available for comment. ABN announced the LaSalle sale along with a $88 billion buyout deal with British bank Barclays ( BARC.L ) on April 23, but a consortium of banks led by Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ) has proposed a competing bid for 71 million euros ($96 million) on the condition that LaSalle remains part of ABN. Shareholder group VEB, representing upwards of 20 percent of ABN's investors, succeeded on May 3 to get a commercial court in Amsterdam to freeze the LaSalle sale, saying that it prevented them and other shareholders from considering competing offers for all of ABN. Although ABN was not required under Dutch law to get shareholder approval for the LaSalle sale, they argued that it effectively acted as a "poison pill" preventing a rival bid to the Barclays offer. ABN has said it would appeal the Dutch commercial court's decision to the Dutch Supreme Court in the Hague. A spokeswoman for the Dutch Supreme Court said that the court received Bank of America's appeal on Tuesday but had not yet received ABN's appeal filing. The spokeswoman added that the two appeals could be combined, but said no decision had been made. The Dutch Supreme Court has indicated that it intends to rule quickly on any appeal, in three to four months, shorter than the usual appeals process of about a year and a half.
