 BOSTON  (Reuters) - General Electric Co ( GE.N ) shares fell about 4 percent on Tuesday after a stock analyst at Goldman Sachs cut his growth forecast for the conglomerate and investors worried about the prospects for a $700 billion bailout by Washington of the financial system. 

 Shares of the second-largest U.S. company by market value have been volatile and last week hit five-year lows, reflecting investors' concerns about how its GE Capital business is holding up in the current tight credit environment. GE Capital accounts for about half of General Electric's profits. GE Capital's operations range from financing purchases of gas turbines for electric power plants to providing loans to companies looking to restructure themselves. GE shares are down about 32 percent so far this year, a deeper fall than 17 percent slide of the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  and the 18 percent decline of the Standard & Poor's 500 index  .SPX . "You're getting a pile-on effect as investors see what is going on with the financials and all the wrangling now with Congress and the administration and is this bill going to pass the way it was presented?" said Peter Klein, senior portfolio manager at Fifth Third Asset Management in Cleveland, Ohio. On Tuesday, the U.S. Treasury Department and Federal Reserve urged Congress to act quickly on the proposed bailout of Wall Street as the global financial crisis deepened. With global economic growth slowing, investors have expressed concern that demand for GE's infrastructure products would decrease, hurting the robust side of the company's operations. "Commodity prices are falling, and we've got all these industrials levered into a strong economy worldwide and Europe is saying they're slowing down," Klein said. He said he added to his position in the stock on Monday because he still views GE shares as attractively valued. NEAR-TERM RISK Goldman Sachs analyst Deane Dray said on Monday in a note to investors that he now expects GE to post flat earnings this year with 2 percent growth in 2009, down from a projected 1 percent increase this year and 4 percent increase in 2009. "There still remains a near-term risk that the credit market meltdown this month could trigger some of the same pressures on GE Capital ... that we saw in the 1Q earnings miss," Dray wrote. GE attributed its first-quarter earnings decline on the freeze in credit markets, which has made it difficult to get deals done. But Dray said the credit environment is worse than GE could have expected. "No one could have foreseen the credit market dislocations witnessed in the past week," Dray wrote. GE shares were down $1.25 at $24.90 on the New York Stock Exchange. In the last year, they have been as low as $22.19, the five-year low hit last week, and as high as $42.15.
