 ROME  (Reuters) - Italy's government is considering the sale of state-owned assets among options to reduce the country's massive public debt, government sources said on Tuesday. 

 "As early as next week there could be a meeting in Rome with financial investors to study the options on the table," one of the sources told Reuters. The sale of further stakes in state-controlled companies such as Eni ( ENI.MI ), Enel ( ENEI.MI ), and Finmeccanica ( SIFI.MI ) was not being considered, the sources said. But sale of stakes in government-owned property and local utilities would be possible options. (Reporting by  Giuseppe Fonte )
