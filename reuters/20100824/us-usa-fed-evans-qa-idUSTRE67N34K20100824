 INDIANAPOLIS  (Reuters) - A double-dip recession is unlikely but the risks of one have risen in the last six months, Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Evans said on Tuesday. 

 "A double dip is not the most likely outcome but I am concerned about how strong the recovery will be," Evans said in response to questions after a speech.
