 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Dell Inc DELL.O is preparing to sweeten its bid for 3PAR Inc ( PAR.N ) after its earlier bid was topped by rival Hewlett-Packard Co's ( HPQ.N ) $1.6 billion bid for the data storage company, according to a report on Bloomberg's website. 

 The report, which cited one person familiar with the matter, said Dell may send the offer within days. A representative for Dell was not immediately available for comment. HP's offer of $24 a share on Monday was 33 percent above Dell's $18-a-share bid and sent 3PAR's shares up 45 percent, above $26 and more than $2 above the HP bid as investors anticipated the bidding could go higher still.
