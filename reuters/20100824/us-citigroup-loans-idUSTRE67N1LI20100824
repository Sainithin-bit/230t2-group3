 BANGALORE  (Reuters) - CitiFinancial's loan delinquency rate, which measures the trend of overdue loans, was 0.25 percentage points more than executives had expected, Bloomberg reported, citing a person briefed on the matter. 

 CitiFinancial is a consumer finance unit of Citigroup Inc ( C.N ) that the bank has overhauled in an effort to cut costs and make it more attractive to potential buyers. The bank's North American consumer finance business, which includes CitiFinancial, had $15.4 billion in personal loans at the end of June. A 0.25 percent increase in overdue loans at CitiFinancial translates to as much as $38.5 million, the agency said. Citigroup's effort to streamline its North American consumer finance unit caused overdue loans to rise more than expected last month as the bank moved 750,000 customer accounts to new locations, the agency said. Citi had expected that the disruptions in its operations would lead to more missed payments as 330 branches were closed and about 180 were converted into "servicing centers" for troubled loans, the person told the agency. The rise in delinquencies was disclosed in a briefing for employees last week by CitiFinancial Chief Executive Mary McDowell, the person told the agency. CitiFinancial spokesman Mark Rodgers declined to comment to Bloomberg on the total dollar amount of delinquencies. CitiFinancial could not immediately be reached for comment by Reuters outside regular U.S. business hours. (Reporting by  Sakthi Prasad  in Bangalore; Editing by Erica Billingham)
