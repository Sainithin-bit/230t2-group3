 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd said on Monday a U.S. District Court has denied a motion by General Electric Co to dismiss litigation that charges GE with trying to monopolize the U.S. market for variable speed wind turbines. 

 Mitsubishi Heavy and Mitsubishi Power Systems Americas Inc filed the original complaint at the U.S. District Court's Western District of Arkansas in May. Mitsubishi had alleged that after it gained foothold in the US in 2006, GE embarked on an anti-competitive scheme to drive Mitsubishi suppliers out of the market. "The judge did decide to stay discovery for the present," said Mitsubishi Power Systems Americas spokeswoman Sonia Williams. "Nevertheless, we are heartened by his suggestion that he may terminate the stay if he finds appropriate circumstances. GE spokesman Dan Nelson said the company disagreed with Mitsubishi Heavy's assessment of the court's order. "The court found it inappropriate to go forward with the case and therefore stayed the case pending the outcome of GE's patent infringement cases against MHI. He added, "GE strongly disagrees with any allegations that it has monopolized any market." The two companies have been escalating a battle with each other over wind turbine technology. In January, the U.S. International Trade Commission found that Mitsubishi Heavy did not infringe GE wind turbine patents. GE has said it will appeal that loss. In February GE filed a lawsuit against Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and two U.S. units, accusing them of infringing two patents used in variable speed wind turbines. (Reporting by  Yinka Adegoke )
