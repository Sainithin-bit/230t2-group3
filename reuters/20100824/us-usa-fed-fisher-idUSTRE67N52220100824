 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve decided to reinvest proceeds from its mortgage-related assets to avoid unintentionally clamping down on monetary policy when the recovery was showing signs of weakening, a top Fed official said on Tuesday. 

 "We didn't want to send a signal that we were tightening at a time when the data was actually getting a little bit weaker," he said in a television interview on Fox Business Network.
