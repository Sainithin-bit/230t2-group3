 MELBOURNE  (Reuters) - Global miner Rio Tinto is weighing a bid with a Chinese partner for Potash Corp as the world's biggest fertilizer company fends off a $39 billion hostile bid from BHP Billiton, a Canadian newspaper said on Tuesday. 

 Citing unnamed sources, Canada's Globe & Mail web site said Rio Tinto "is said to be considering a bid alongside a Chinese player as relations between the two sides strengthen." Rio Tinto Chief Executive Tom Albanese last week declined to comment on whether Rio would be interested in bidding for Potash Corp. (Reporting by  Sonali Paul ; Editing by  Ed Davies )
