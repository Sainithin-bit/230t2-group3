 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bank of New York Mellon Corp lowered its dividend 63 percent to build capital, after a decline in fees resulting from falling equity markets caused first-quarter profit to decline more than expected. 

 Shares fell 7.2 percent to $26.00 in premarket trading. Net income attributable to common shareholders declined 57 percent to $322 million, or 28 cents per share, from $746 million, or 65 cents per share, a year earlier, the bank said. Excluding writedowns for goodwill and investments as well as merger costs, profit was 53 cents per share, below the average analyst forecast of 63 cents, Reuters Estimates said. Revenue, excluding investment writedowns, fell 14 percent to $3.28 billion, short of the average $3.67 billion forecast. Expenses fell 10 percent. Bank of New York Mellon reduced its quarterly dividend to 9 cents per share from 24 cents. Citing a "difficult market environment," Chief Executive Robert Kelly said the decision to lower the payout "was not made lightly." He said the bank hopes to use the savings to build capital, pursue growth, and repay the $3 billion of taxpayer funds from the government's $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program when regulators allow. The bank's ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets was 4.2 percent, close to what many analysts prefer. Bank of New York Mellon's main rivals, State Street Corp and Northern Trust Corp, also report results on Tuesday. State Street said profit declined. Custodial banks provide processing and back-office services to institutional clients. Bank of New York Mellon, Northern Trust and State Street are also large asset managers. FEE REVENUE SLUMPS Bank of New York Mellon said total fee revenue fell 20 percent to $2.43 billion. This included a 20 percent decline from securities servicing to $1.23 billion, and a 28 percent drop in asset and wealth management to $609 million. Fees also declined 20 percent from the fourth quarter, including a 40 percent drop in foreign exchange. Bank of New York Co's July 2007 purchase of Mellon Financial Corp created a custodial power now handling $19.5 trillion of assets. As an asset manager, it oversees $881 billion of client assets. Founded in 1784 by Alexander Hamilton, Bank of New York is the oldest U.S. banking company. Mellon was founded in 1869 and grew to prominence under financier Andrew Mellon. Both companies quit branch banking this decade. Shares of Bank of New York Mellon closed Monday at $28.03 on the New York Stock Exchange. Through Monday, they have fallen 1 percent this year, compared with a 29 percent drop in the KBW Bank Index. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel; editing by John Wallace and Gerald E. McCormick)
