 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. Bancorp, one of the 10 largest U.S. banks, reported higher-than-expected quarterly earnings on Tuesday on record revenue from mortgages, sending its shares up 9 percent. 

 The strong mortgage activity helped to offset losses from lease financing, construction and development loans, and credit cards. The bank also put aside $1.3 billion for loan losses, $833 million more than a year earlier, as declining home prices affected both consumer and commercial loan portfolios. "I don't expect us to stop reserve-building until which time we see strength in the reduction of (losses)," Chief Executive Richard Davis said on a call with analysts, noting that he expects losses to start to moderate toward the end of the year. First-quarter profit for common stockholders fell to $419 million, or 24 cents per share, from $1.08 billion, or 62 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average were expected the Minneapolis-based company to earn 20 cents a share. A loss of $198 million from an investment in a large domestic bank's perpetual preferred stock also hurt U.S. Bancorp in the quarter. DECLINING LOAN INTEREST Like Wells Fargo & Co and JPMorgan Chase & Co, which both reported last week, U.S. Bancorp saw record mortgage production revenues from new applications and refinancing. But broader interest in loans started to decrease in the second half of the quarter, Davis said, attributing this to customers becoming more careful. "There are a number of customers who are neither as qualified as they were a year ago, nor are they interested in (more) debt," he said. U.S. Bancorp received $6.6 billion in taxpayer funds under the U.S. government's Troubled Asset Relief Program last year, and TARP recipients have been under fire for not extending this money to customers. "We have not denied a single creditworthy customer since the beginning of this downturn," Davis said. In March, U.S. Bancorp cut its dividend 88 percent to 5 cents a share from 42.5 cents. The bank in November took over failed California lenders Downey Financial Corp and PFF Bancorp Inc, with support from the federal government. U.S. Bancorp shares were up 9 percent at $17.37 in early New York Stock Exchange trade. At Monday's close, the stock had fallen 36 percent this year, while the broader KBW Banks index was down 29 percent.
