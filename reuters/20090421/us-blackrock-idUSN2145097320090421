 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc ( BLK.N ), the largest publicly traded U.S. asset manager, said first-quarter profit plunged by nearly two-thirds as falling markets depressed asset values and slashed its fees. 

 But BlackRock shares soared 8.45 percent as Chief Executive Laurence Fink emphasized the firm's opportunities for expansion and his view that investors are starting to come off the sidelines. "As a result of this market setback and the extreme uncertainty surrounding the market declines and their shock, clients were frozen at the beginning of the quarter," Fink said. But prospects have improved since the middle of last month, he said. "The amount of (new business) we are seeing now suggests that clients are now looking prospectively on how best to position themselves," he said. Still, the first-quarter results highlighted the difficulties money managers face as markets decline and investors sell risky holdings in favor of safer instruments. The market convulsions at the end of last year continued to weigh on investors through most of the first quarter, BlackRock, the first of the major U.S. asset managers to report quarterly results, said net income fell to $84 million, or 62 cents a share, from $241 million, or $1.77 a share, a year earlier. Revenue from fund management, advisory business and its own investments fell 24 percent to $987 million. Assets under management, a key measure for firms like BlackRock, fell 6 percent to $1.28 trillion. BlackRock said there are hopeful signs for future business. Institutional clients began seeking new money managers in the second half of March for the first time since last summer, and demand for international retail products has also lifted after a long contraction, it said. Stripping out restructuring charges and other items, BlackRock earned 81 cents a share, matching analysts' average forecast, according to Reuters Estimates. The company's fixed income expertise has won it mandates to manage risky assets from troubled companies ranging from Bear Stearns to American International Group Inc ( AIG.N ). BlackRock shares have suffered less than the broader market this year, falling 2.2 percent, compared with a 4.6 decline in the Standard & Poor's 500 index  .SPX . The shares were up $10.44 to $134.03 in midday trade on the New York Stock Exchange. (Additional reporting by  Dan Wilchins ; editing by John Wallace)
