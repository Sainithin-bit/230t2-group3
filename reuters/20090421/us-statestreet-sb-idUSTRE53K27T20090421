 BOSTON  (Reuters) - State Street Corp ( STT.N ), one of the world's biggest institutional investors, reported a 10 percent drop in quarterly profit as earnings from managing and administering customer assets declined. 

 The company, whose stock had been under pressure this year as investors worry about unrealized losses on its investment portfolio, said such losses totaled $5.9 billion, down from $6.3 billion at the end of the 2008 fourth quarter. Boston-based State Street said first-quarter net profit shrank to $476 million from $530 million a year earlier, while earnings per share fell to $1.02 from $1.35. Operating earnings were $1.04 per share, better than the $1.02 analysts had expected but still down 25 percent from a year earlier. The 271-year-old company, which also earns money for keeping records and providing accounting and other services to investment managers, reported a 20 percent drop in servicing fees to $766 million. Assets under custody declined 24 percent to $11.3 trillion. Investment management fees declined 35 percent to $181 million as assets under management dropped 29 percent to $1.4 trillion. Total revenue declined 22 percent to $2 billion. The company's outlook for 2009 turned slightly more gloomy. Chief Executive Ron Logue said earlier this year that operating earnings would likely decline by 12 percent to 16 percent. He said on Tuesday, "Given the continued unsettled economic environment and more weakness in the first quarter than we expected, we now believe that in 2009 we will achieve nearer the weaker end of the ranges." State Street, which received $2 billion from the U.S. Treasury last year under the Troubled Asset Relief Program, said unrealized losses in company-administered asset-backed commercial paper conduits were $3.6 billion, unchanged from the end of December. In February, the company said it would slash its dividend and dramatically cut bonuses to help increase its capital levels. Analysts had blamed high unrealized losses for State Street's tumbling stock price at the start of the year. A recent change in mark-to-market accounting rules was seen as helping the company. State Street shares have dropped 55 percent in the last 12 months and 22 percent since January. The Dow Jones U.S. Asset Managers Index has fallen 5.50 percent since January.
