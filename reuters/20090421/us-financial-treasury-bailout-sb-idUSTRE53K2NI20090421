 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Treasury still has about $134.6 billion available in its coffers from last fall's bank bailout package and that should be enough for it to avoid asking Congress for more money, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said on Tuesday. 

 "We have the resources to move forward implementing all aspects of our Financial Stability Plan," Geithner said in a letter to the panel overseeing the bailout. Geithner said there was still about $109.6 billion available from the $700 billion rescue package passed last year and expects to get at least an additional $25 billion back, bringing the total to $134.6 billion.
