 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Oil prices climbed into positive territory on Tuesday, tracking gains on Wall Street as OPEC-member Iran said the cartel may need to restrict supplies further to thin down brimming global stockpiles. 

 U.S. crude for May delivery rose 63 cents to settle at $46.51 a barrel on expiration day, rebounding from a nearly five-week low of $43.83 a barrel hit earlier in the day. London Brent crude fell 4 cents to $49.82. The gains came as U.S. stock markets rose roughly 1 percent after industrial bellwether United Technologies ( UTX.N ) posted results that beat Wall Street expectations and bank shares rebounded. Oil prices have been tracking moves in equities closely in recent months as traders look for signs of a recovery from the economic slowdown that has curbed global demand for oil for the first time in a quarter century. Adding some support, Iran's OPEC governor said the producer group may decide to further cut its oil output in May if the market continued to remain oversupplied, and expressed concern consumer countries are stockpiling oil due to lower prices. "OPEC may decide to further cut its output in its next meeting if the market remains oversupplied," Mohammad Ali Khatibi told reporters. "Consumer countries are increasingly stockpiling oil." U.S. crude oil stockpiles are running at their highest in nearly 19 years, and analysts said inventories likely continued to rise through last week. Industry group the American Petroleum Institute will release its U.S. energy supply report Tuesday afternoon, and the government's Energy Information Administration will release its figures Wednesday morning. Oil traders also remained focused on the health of the financial system, after the International Monetary Fund said global write-downs of toxic debt among financial institutions still had a long way to go, and could reach $4.1 trillion. Oil prices have been trading in a tight band between $46 and $55 for the past month, after rallying steadily since mid-February from the mid-$30s, helped by hopes of economic recovery and OPEC's compliance with agreed supply cuts. The producer group has already cut member output quotas by 4.2 million barrels per day since September. (Additional reporting by  David Sheppard  in London; Editing by Marguerita Choy)
