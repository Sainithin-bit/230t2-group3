 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Capital One Financial Corp ( COF.N ), a leading issuer of MasterCard and Visa credit cards, reported a first-quarter loss on Tuesday, hurt by growing credit losses, and higher provisions for bad loans. 

 The McLean, Virginia-based company posted a quarterly loss available to common shareholders of $176.1 million, or 45 cents per share, compared with a net income of $548.5 million, or $1.47 cent per share, a year earlier. In the U.S. card business, charge-offs -- debts the company believes it will never collect -- increased to 8.39 percent in the first-quarter from 7.08 percent in the fourth quarter. Capital One set aside $124.1 million for loan losses, anticipating a further deterioration of its credit portfolio that is under pressure as unemployment rises. Capital One's total managed revenue fell 18.6 percent to $3.7 billion. Capital One's shares fell 6 percent to $14.15 in after-hours trading. The stock had closed up 12.48 percent to $15.05 on the New York Stock Exchange. The company's shares have dropped about 52 percent this year, more than the 25 percent decline in the KBW Bank Index .BKX. (Reporting by  Juan Lagorio , editing by Leslie Gevirtz)
