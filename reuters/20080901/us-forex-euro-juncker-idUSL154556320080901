 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - The head of the eurogroup of countries that share the euro currency on Monday welcomed the recent recovery of the U.S. dollar, but said the euro remained overvalued. 

 "Things are developing in the right direction," Jean-Claude Juncker told Reuters after an EU leaders summit in Brussels. Juncker is prime minister of Luxembourg. "Things are more in line with the economic policy and commitments of the United States that have been stated in recent months," he said. Eurozone officials expressed frustration earlier this year that, despite comments by top U.S. policy-makers in support of a strong dollar, the greenback remained in the doldrums. "A strong dollar is good for the United States. A strong dollar is good for the global economy," Juncker said on Monday. Asked whether the euro was closer to fair value now against the dollar, Juncker said: "In line with what we have previously said, we still think that the euro is still overvalued." The dollar, which sank to a low of more than $1.60 to the euro in July, was trading at around $1.47 at 1830 GMT on Monday. Against a basket of major currencies, the dollar rose to its highest level this year during the day, boosted by a sharp drop in oil prices. U.S. crude oil futures CLc1 fell $4.51 to $110.95 a barrel in afternoon trading on Monday after Hurricane Gustav weakened to a Category 2 storm before hitting the coast near a key port that supports most of the Gulf of Mexico oil and gas drilling operations. In March, the United States, Europe, and Japan had discussed joint intervention to rescue the dollar if it extended the sharp losses it was suffering at the time, an international finance source told Reuters last week. The European Central Bank faced renewed criticism earlier this year from some European leaders, including French President Nicolas Sarkozy, alarmed at the strength of the euro that has made it harder for European exporters to compete.
