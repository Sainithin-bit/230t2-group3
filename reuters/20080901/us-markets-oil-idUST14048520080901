 LONDON  (Reuters) - Oil plunged more than $4 on Monday as concerns that Hurricane Gustav would cause lasting damage to the U.S. oil sector eased after the storm weakened before hitting the Louisiana coast. 

 Gustav -- which forced more than a quarter of the United States' refining capacity to shut down or cut processing rates -- weakened to a Category 1 storm after roaring ashore near Port Fourchon, Louisiana, a key logistical port that supports 75 percent of Gulf of Mexico drilling operations. For a graph on the projected path of Gustav, please see:  here U.S. crude fell $4.06 in electronic trading to $111.40 a barrel by 6:30 p.m. EDT as markets discounted the potential damage from the storm, which had earlier been forecast to hit the United States as a Category 4 storm. London Brent settled down $4.64 at $109.41. "It looks like Gustav is not going to be as strong a storm as the market had feared," said Phil Flynn, analyst at Alaron Trading in Chicago. All of the 1.3 million barrels per day of oil production capacity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico was shut as of Monday morning, according to the U.S. government. On shore, some 13 oil refineries representing about 15 percent of the nation's fuel production capacity were shut, according to company officials, trade sources and a report from the U.S. Department of Energy. Another 10 refineries reduced production rates due to the hurricane. The Louisiana Offshore Oil Port, the only U.S. port capable of offloading the biggest oil tankers, also halted all operations due to high winds and waves. Experts said operations could resume quickly if facilities make it through the hurricane without significant damage, but the extent of the damage will not be known for days. "It's going to be a couple of days for checks at any of the (offshore) production facilities," Chevron spokesman Mickey Driver said. The U.S. government has said it is ready to release crude from the nation's emergency stockpile if Gustav triggers a prolonged disruption to supply. Gustav is the biggest threat to the region -- home to a quarter of U.S. oil output and more than a third of U.S. refining capacity -- since hurricanes Katrina and Rita wrecked more than 100 offshore oil platforms in 2005 and closed several large refineries for months. OPEC MEETING LOOMS Oil's losses on Monday extended a slide from record highs above $147 a barrel struck in July as high fuel prices and wider economic problems hit demand in the United States and Europe. OPEC member Iran has insisted that oil markets are oversupplied, and the nation's oil minister said on Sunday that $100 a barrel was the lowest acceptable price for crude. OPEC meets in Vienna on September 9 to discuss output policy, but other member nations have backed Iran so far. Venezuela and Ecuador said on Friday they expect the oil exporters' group to maintain current output levels. The group increased oil supply for a fourth consecutive month in August, mainly due to higher output from Iran and smaller hikes from Nigeria and Angola, a Reuters survey showed.
