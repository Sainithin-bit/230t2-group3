 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. natural gas futures fell more than 5 percent in electronic trading on Monday as Hurricane Gustav weakened to a Category 2 storm. 

 Gustav, which is expected to make landfall later Monday on the Louisiana coast, had been forecast to be as strong as a Category 4 storm earlier. (Reporting by  Robert Campbell ; Editing by John Picinich)
