 LONDON  (Reuters) - China need not accelerate the appreciation of its renminbi currency against the U.S. dollar, the Financial Times quoted a former senior Chinese economic policy-maker as saying. 

 It said the comments by Cheng Siwei, former vice-chairman of the standing committee of National People's Congress, were likely to disturb many in the United States, who are hoping a faster appreciation will help rebalance the world economy and improve prospects for U.S. growth. "My point is that we don't need to accelerate the appreciation of the renminbi. The dollar will not weaken very much and may get stronger, as happened <in August>," Cheng told the Financial Times (  here  ). "This makes appreciation of the Chinese currency against the dollar less necessary," he said. The renminbi was still likely to appreciate against other currencies. Cheng acknowledged there were some disputes about exchange rate policy in Beijing. (Writing by  Ralph Boulton , editing by Myra MacDonald)
