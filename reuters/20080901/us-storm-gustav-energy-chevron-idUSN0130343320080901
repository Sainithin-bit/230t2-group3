 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - Chevron Corp ( CVX.N ) said Monday checks for damage at offshore platforms in the Gulf of Mexico will take a "couple of days" once the bulk of Hurricane Gustav passes on shore. 

 The eye of Gustav came ashore earlier on Monday, most of the storm's rain and winds remain far out over the Gulf of Mexico. (Reporting by  Erwin Seba ; Editing by John Picinich)
