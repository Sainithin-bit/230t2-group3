 (Reuters) - Commerzbank said on Monday it would cut 9,000 jobs and shrink investment bank Dresdner Kleinwort after buying Dresdner Bank. 

 Following is a summary of some of the biggest job losses at major banks since the start of the credit crisis: * BANK OF AMERICA CORP The second-largest U.S. bank by assets expects to eliminate about 7,500 jobs over the next two years after it completes its acquisition of Countrywide Financial Corp, the largest U.S. mortgage lender. Separately, Bank of America is cutting about 3,000 jobs, mainly in corporate and investment banking. * CITIGROUP INC Citigroup Inc has chopped 14,000 jobs this year. * COMMERZBANK The German bank announced its plan on Monday to cut 9,000 jobs in the wake of its agreement to purchase Dresdner Bank from Allianz. About 2,500 jobs of the 9,000 cuts will be outside Germany. According to a person familiar with the matter, about 2,000 of those will be cut from Dresdner Kleinwort. * CREDIT SUISSE GROUP The bank has axed a total of more than 1,320 jobs, with the majority in investment banking, since the start of the credit crisis last year. * DEUTSCHE BANK AG The biggest German bank has laid off about 450 people in corporate finance and investment banking in 2008. * GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC The world's largest securities firm laid off hundreds of investment bankers in June. In April it initiated a round of market-related cuts, hitting such areas as leveraged lending and mortgage securities, though none have been announced publicly. In January the bank said it planned to lay off about 5 percent of its global workforce, or 1,500 jobs. * HSBC HOLDINGS PLC Europe's biggest bank said last September it would close its U.S. subprime mortgage unit, laying off 750 employees. * JPMORGAN CHASE & CO JPMorgan said on May 21 that more than 7,600 Bear Stearns Co's employees were expected to lose their jobs as the investment bank is absorbed into JPMorgan. On May 13, people familiar with the situation said JPMorgan could cut as many as 4,000 employees worldwide, with roughly 2,000 slated to be replaced by counterparts from Bear Stearns. Between August 2007 and before its incorporation into JPMorgan, Bear Stearns announced about 1,500 job cuts. * LEHMAN BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC The fourth-largest U.S. investment bank is looking to cut 1,200 jobs in its latest cost-cutting drive. The job cuts would amount to roughly 5 percent of the workforce and are in addition to the three other rounds of cuts totaling 4,000. * MERRILL LYNCH & CO INC The U.S. investment bank has reduced staffing by about 4,200 this year, leaving it with 60,000 full-time employees at the end of June. * MORGAN STANLEY The U.S. investment bank said on July 31 it was done cutting jobs, having slashed 4,800 jobs in the past year. * NATIONAL CITY CORP National City, one of the top 10 U.S. banks, has slashed at least 3,400 jobs since mid-2007, mostly in mortgages. * UBS AG Europe's worst-hit bank has axed about 7,000 jobs since 2007, mostly in investment banking and fixed income. * UNICREDIT SPA Europe's fourth-largest bank said last month it would shed 9,000 posts out of 100,000 in Germany, Austria and its domestic base Italy. * WACHOVIA CORP The fourth-largest U.S. bank said in August, after a record $9.11 billion quarterly loss, it would cut 6,950 jobs, 600 more than it had previously disclosed, with additional cuts in its mortgage operations. The cuts affect 5.8 percent of Wachovia's 120,000 staff. Wachovia also is cutting 4,400 open positions.
