 MEXICO CITY  (Reuters) - One of Mexico's three main oil export ports in the Gulf of Mexico, Cayo Arcas, was closed for a second day on Monday due to rough weather, the communications and transport ministry said. 

 Dos Bocas and Coatzacoalcos, the two other Mexican crude ports in the Gulf, where Hurricane Gustav blew strong winds and rain into Louisiana, were still open, the ministry said. (Reporting by  Noel Randewich ; Editing by John Picinich)
