 LONDON  (Reuters) - Financial markets began the month in a volatile mood on Monday as gloom about Britain's economic downturn knocked sterling to a 12-year low and oil tumbled 4 percent on the day as Hurricane Gustav lost some of its power. 

 European stocks led a broad decline in world stocks after investors gave the thumbs-down to Commerzbank's $14.5 billion purchase of Dresdner Bank from Allianz. The yen briefly trimmed the day's gains against majors after Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda resigned, becoming the second Japanese leader to resign abruptly in less than a year. Sterling, already under pressure in recent weeks, fell anew after weekend newspaper comments by British finance minister Alistair Darling added to gloom about the UK economy. Darling said the economic challenges facing the world could be the worst for 60 years. Mortgage and manufacturing data did little to dispel the notion the economy was heading for recession and speculation the Bank of England might cut interest rates before the year end. "The economic data is just coming in awful and you aren't getting the sense of things bottoming out like you might in the U.S.," said Michael Hart, head of European FX strategy in Citigroup. Sterling slipped below $1.80 for the first time since April 2006, having traded above $2 only in July this year. The pound fell to a record low of 81.40 per euro while on the trade-weighted index, it hit its lowest in 12 years. The dollar hit its highest level for the year against a basket of currencies, thanks to weakness in European currencies and tumbling oil prices. OIL SLIDES Crude oil prices fell 4 percent to a four-month low of $110.63 a barrel after Gustav weakened to a Category 2 hurricane, easing fears of major damage to oil facilities in the Gulf of Mexico. Gustav was expected to move ashore to the west, sparing New Orleans its full force. The storm, however, is the biggest threat to the region -- home to a quarter of U.S. oil output and 15 percent of natural gas output -- since Hurricanes Katrina and Rita wrecked more than 100 offshore oil platforms in 2005 and closed several large refineries for months. Nearly 2 million people have fled the U.S. coastal areas. NEW MONTH, OLD PROBLEMS General gloom about the economic outlook -- with Japan and the euro zone already half way into recession -- weighed on stocks. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares fell 0.15 percent, after notching up a gain of 1.2 percent in August, only its second monthly gain in 10 months. Commerzbank fell more than 10 percent while Allianz was flat. "The price paid by Commerzbank is at the high end... The main problem is the execution risk and how the two are going to bring the operating costs together," said Bernard McAlinden, market strategist at NCB Stockbrokers. MSCI world equity index fell 0.7 percent, having fallen 2.3 percent in August to post its third consecutive monthly loss. U.S. markets were closed for the Labor Day holiday. Government bonds in major economies benefited from flight to quality flows, with September Bund futures rising 36 ticks and short sterling rate futures rising 15 ticks. (Editing by Stephen Nisbet)
