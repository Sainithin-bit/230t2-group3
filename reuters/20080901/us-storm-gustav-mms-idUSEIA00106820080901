 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oil companies operating in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico have shut down 96.3 percent of the region's crude oil production and 82.3 percent of its natural gas production due to Hurricane Gustav -- the same amount as was shut on Sunday, a U.S. government agency said on Monday. 

 The Minerals Management Service said 1.251 million barrels per day of crude oil output and 6.086 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas production in the Gulf had been shut down as of 1130 CDT (1630 GMT). (Reporting by  Richard Valdmanis )
