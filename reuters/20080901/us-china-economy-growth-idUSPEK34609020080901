 BEIJING  (Reuters) - China should aim to maintain reasonable expansion of investment and cut taxes to sustain its strong growth, a senior government economist said in remarks published on Monday. 

 Lu Zhongyuan, deputy head of the Development Research Centre, said Beijing needed such measures to avoid a drastic fall in economic growth, as weakening property and automobile markets implied China would have limited room to further boost consumption demand in the second half. He told the official People's Daily that China should increase investment in projects that would help save energy, clean up the environment and upgrade technology. Beijing also needed to cut value-added taxes and increase export tax rebates, Lu said. His think-tank falls under the State Council, China's cabinet. JPMorgan Chase said in a report last month that China was considering a stimulus package of at least 200-400 billion yuan, which would include tax cuts and measures to support the domestic stock and property markets. Beijing has already rolled out a slew of pro-growth measures, including more loans to small firms and higher tax rebates for textile exporters. Lu added that although high global grain and food prices as well as rising domestic utilities prices would pose upward pressure, consumer inflation would continue to ease the rest of the year. Annual consumer inflation eased to 6.3 percent in July from 7.1 percent in June and off a near 11-year high of 8.7 percent in February. Chinese manufacturers are unlikely to pass on higher input prices to consumers due to fierce competition, he said. Fang Aiqing, an assistant commerce minister, agreed. He told the same paper that there was an ample supply of all the 600 types of consumer goods that the ministry tracks, and that supply would continue to grow as weak global demand forces exporters to sell products in the domestic market.
