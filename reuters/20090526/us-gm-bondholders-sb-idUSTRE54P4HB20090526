 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp's offer to exchange shares in the reorganized company for $27 billion in bond debt has met with a tepid response from investors, sources familiar with the process said on Tuesday. 

 GM bondholders have only tendered a low-single digit percentage of the total debt available, the people said, asking not to be named because details of the exchange are not public. GM has said it could be forced to file for bankruptcy if it was not able to retire 90 percent -- or $24 billion -- of its bond debt in the exchange offer that expires just before midnight. GM, which has lost $82 billion in the past four years and has received $19.4 billion in government funding since the beginning of this year, has been struggling to cut costs and reduce debt to continue to receive more government aid. The company said on Friday it expected to need another $7.6 billion from the U.S. Treasury after June 1. The largest U.S. automaker last week reached a deal with the United Auto Workers union to cut labor costs and accept new terms for a $20 billion union retiree healthcare obligation. Workers are due to finish voting on the agreement by Thursday. Under GM's current plan, a UAW trust fund for healthcare would receive a GM stake of about 39 percent. The U.S. Treasury would hold a 50-percent stake while bondholders would be given 10 percent. Bondholders have balked at forgiving their debt in exchange for a 10 percent stake in a restructured company. "The bondholders are not interested at all," one of the sources said. "There is a feeling of resignation in the community. They'd rather fight it out in bankruptcy court than do anything at this point." (Reporting by Jui Chakravorty Das; Editing by  Tim Dobbyn )
