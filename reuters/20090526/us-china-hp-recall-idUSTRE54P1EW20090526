 BEIJING  (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard Co, the world's largest PC maker, is recalling 15,000 laptop batteries distributed in China because of a danger they could overheat, China said on Tuesday on its quality inspections web site. 

 HP China will replace the batteries -- used in HP Pavilion, Compaq Presario and HP Compaq models -- for free because in extreme conditions they can overheat and pose a fire hazard, the government said on its website (www.aqsiq.gov.cn). HP was not immediately available for comment. The laptop PCs were manufactured between late 2007 and early 2008, according to the website. (Reporting by  Kirby Chien ; Editing by  Ken Wills )
