 TORONTO  (Reuters) - Magna International Inc's MGa.TO bid to buy Germany's iconic Opel brand is a gamble on the future of the auto industry in Europe and a chance for its billionaire founder to cement his legacy. 

 Stung by the global plunge in auto sales, but awash in cash, the Canadian company is looking to scoop up Opel from General Motors Corp ( GM.N ), enabling it to make the jump from parts supplier to automaker. For Frank Stronach, the self-made billionaire who founded Magna, buying Opel would represent a personal jump as well. His company has grown into the third-biggest and most diversified auto parts company in the world, but Stronach is looking to leave an even bigger impression. "Magna have a relatively small contract manufacturing operation in Austria, which concentrates more on niche type vehicles, but (Opel) gives them a chance to get some real mainstream production capacity and get some mainstream models as well," said Tim Urquhart, an analyst at IHS Global Insight in London Even so, Urquhart said: "There's no doubt it's a high-risk strategy." If Magna wins the bid, the company that started in a garage in Toronto about 50 years ago would emerge as a major player in the cutthroat Western European auto market, competing against the likes of BMW ( BMWG.DE ), Volkswagen AG ( VOWG.DE ) and Fiat SpA ( FIA.MI ), all of which Magna currently counts as customers. "We have always said our preference would never be to compete with our customers," Stronach, who's Magna's chairman, said at the company's annual general meeting in early May. "But on the other hand, we are in the automotive business, we build cars, we take a look at everything." Magna is partnering with Russian bank Sberbank Rossii SBER03.MM on the 700 million euro Opel bid. Under the arrangement, Sberbank would take 35 percent of the company, Magna would get 20 percent, Opel's employees would get 10 percent and GM would keep a 35 percent stake. Russian carmaker GAZ Group ( GAZA.RTS ) would be an industrial partner under the plan. OPEN DOOR TO RUSSIA Magna, like every player in the auto industry, has taken a hit during the global slump in car sales, but its cash on hand -- $1.7 billion at the end of the most recent quarter -- sets it apart from many of its competitors and puts it in a position to take advantage of deals on the market. "They're saying this is the right time" to buy into a European auto company, said Richard Cooper, executive director for Canada at JD Power and Associates. "Things are not going to get any easier in the automotive business over the next little while and the other thing ... is that the Japanese and Chinese and Koreans are looking at Europe as a growth market -- not just Western Europe, but central and Eastern Europe." Siegfried Wolf, Magna's co-chief executive, said at the company's AGM that, while Russia has been hit hard by the economic downturn, "we believe that the Russian economy will bounce back, offering significant potential for Magna." He said Magna was taking steps to beef up its presence in Russia and other developing markets. "When the Russian market starts to recover, (Magna will likely) really lay a real assault on the Russian market as well, hence the partnership with GAZ group and also Sberbank," said IHS Global Insight's Urquhart. Magna's headquarters sit amid the rolling farmland of Aurora, Ontario, 50 kilometers north of Toronto. That is where Austrian-born Stronach ended up after emigrating to Canada in the mid-1950s with almost no cash in his pocket. He is now 76 years old, with a personal fortune estimated by Canadian Business magazine at more than $1 billion. "There's a big legacy thing going on here," said Urquhart. "I think he wants to turn himself into a big OEM (original equipment manufacturer) ... and this will be a sort of legacy to his company."
