 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - The German government is expected to choose a preferred bidder for General Motors' German unit Opel on Wednesday. 

 Italian automaker Fiat, Canadian-Austrian Magna International and Belgium-listed industrial holding RHJ International have submitted offers for Opel. Following are some questions answered on what will happen next in the process to find a buyer for Opel: WHO WILL PICK AN INVESTOR FOR OPEL? The German government jointly with GM managers will decide on at least one preferred investor for Opel on Wednesday evening. The investor will then sign a letter of intent to invest in the German automaker. The final decision on a buyer for Opel will be made by the U.S. government and parent company GM. "Currently the outcome of the bidding process is fully open," said Commerzbank analyst Gregor Claussen in a note. BY WHEN DOES THE SALE NEED TO BE AGREED? The German government is pushing to work out a deal for Opel before June 1, which is the deadline for parent company GM to complete restructuring talks with stakeholders. GM is expected to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection at that time. By rushing through a deal this week, the German government could ensure that Opel is separated from GM and access to its patents is secured ahead of the Chapter 11 filing. WHAT IF NO GROUP IS PICKED? Germany's Economy Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg said on Sunday that the bids from Fiat, Magna and RHJ were still unacceptable because the government would shoulder too much potential financial risk. He said an insolvency of Opel could not be ruled out. Magna's proposal for Opel includes plans to ask the German government to guarantee credit lines to the tune of between 4 billon and 5 billion euros. Fiat's proposal would need funding of about 7 billion euros. "From a taxpayer's perspective, it is therefore highly questionable whether any of the two bids from the industrial players will turn out to be a good deal," said Commerzbank's Claussen. HOW WILL OPEL'S BUSINESS BE FINANCED UNTIL A DEAL CLOSES? The German government is looking at appointing a trustee to protect Opel's assets from GM creditors if the U.S. carmaker files for bankruptcy. As part of this proposed interim solution, a consortium of banks could then provide Opel with bridge financing until a long-term investor is found. Opel would receive 750 million euros from state-owned KfW and another 750 million euros combined from the four German states that are home to Opel factories. HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE UNTIL THE DEAL CLOSES? The takeover of Opel by an investor is likely to take weeks or months to be completed. GM Europe's President Carl-Peter Forster has said he expected the sale process could last until the fourth quarter of this year.
