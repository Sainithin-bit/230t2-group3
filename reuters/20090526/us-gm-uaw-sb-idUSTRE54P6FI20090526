 (Reuters) - United Auto Workers officials unanimously endorsed a new cost-cutting labor agreement with General Motors Corp on Tuesday, paving the way for a quick ratification this week. 

 The UAW, in documents prepared for its members, said that it was required to make a series of changes to a retiree healthcare trust and other benefits in order for GM to receive additional government support. Following are highlights of the new GM contract agreement, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters. UAW HEALTHCARE TRUST * The UAW-aligned healthcare trust -- the Voluntary Employees Beneficiary Association -- will receive half of the $20 billion debt GM owes the fund in the form of stock and new debt, instead of cash. * The VEBA will receive 17.5 percent of the common stock in a restructured automaker. The remaining GM stock will be allocated between other creditors of the company and the U.S. government. * The VEBA will also receive $6.5 billion in preferred shares that pay a 9 percent cash dividend and a new $2.5 billion note. Cash payments under the note including accrued interest will be $1.38 billion payable in 2013, 2015 and 2017. * The UAW's VEBA will also receive warrants representing an additional 2.5 percent of GM common shares. * Retiree medical benefits will be cut with immediate effect at the insistence of the U.S. Treasury because of GM's "difficult financial situation." * Benefits for retirees could be cut further in 2010 and 2011 because of the "uncertainty regarding the long-term value of the GM stock" received by the VEBA. * UAW anticipates paying retiree health care benefits in 2010 and 2011 from cash, including the $585 million dividend from preferred stock. It does not expect to be able to sell GM stock until 2012 at the earliest. DELPHI * GM will assume ownership of five Delphi Corp plants as part of its restructuring plan. Those include parts plants in Saginaw, Michigan; Lockport, New York; Rochester, New York; Grand Rapids, Michigan, and Kokomo, Indiana. The plants will be operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of GM. U.S. MANUFACTURING * GM agrees to reactivate three U.S. assembly plants and one stamping plant if sales exceed expectations. * GM will build compact and small car assembly operations in the United States using one of its idled plants represented by the UAW. BUYOUTS * GM will offer new buyouts to all UAW-represented employees under a program that will be presented to workers by June 9. * Workers with 20 years' experience or more will be offered $115,000 in cash and a $25,000 vehicle voucher. Those who worked more than 10 years and less than 20 years will be offered $80,000 and a $25,000 vehicle voucher. Workers with less than 10 years of experience will be offered $45,000 and a $25,000 vehicle voucher. * Employees will have 45 days to accept the buyouts following the rollout of the program. OTHER TERMS * UAW workers will be eligible for time-and-a-half overtime only after working 40 hours in a week. * Break time reduced to 40 minutes per eight-hour shift. * Cost-of-living adjustments will not be paid for the duration of the modified contract. Performance bonuses will not be paid in 2009 and 2010. (Reporting by  Soyoung Kim , editing by Matthew Lewis)
