 LONDON  (Reuters) - Private equity firm Texas Pacific Group TPG.UL is considering a bid for J. Sainsbury ( SBRY.L ) and is working on building a consortium, the Financial Times reported. 


 Private equity groups CVC CVC.UL, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts KKR.UL and Blackstone BG.UL said on Friday they were in the early stages of assessing a bid for Sainsbury, Britain's third-largest supermarket owner, in what would be Europe's biggest leveraged buyout. The FT in its weekend edition, without citing sources, said U.S. buyout firm Texas Pacific Group was working on a rival consortium, which could also include Bain Capital, Permira PERM.UL and Cinven CINV.UL. Sainsbury shares leapt on Friday as much as 18 percent to an eight-year high at 526-1/2 pence, valuing the business at nearly 10 billion pounds. Texas Pacific Group could not immediately be reached on Sunday. Sainsbury, which is midway through Chief Executive Justin King's three-year restructuring, said on Friday it had not received any proposal and therefore had no comment to make. The Observer on Sunday quoted "a well-placed source" as saying that CVC and its partners would "soon make an indicative offer to the board". However, since CVC's Friday announcement, analysts have warned that any bidder for Sainsbury may now find it difficult to succeed because the share price surge could make the group too expensive. Sainsbury's shares have risen nearly 50 percent in the past year on expectations for King's turnaround as well as due to speculation about a private equity bid. Before Friday's share price surge, Numis analyst Steve Davies, who last week forecast a bid approach for Sainsbury, said he believed a financial buyer who was prepared to arrange a full sale and leaseback on its properties could afford to pay 600 pence per share. Analysts have said that even if the chances of a Sainsbury offer are now slimmer, the bid momentum may flow to other companies, with rival Morrison Supermarkets and non-food retailers Home Retail Group ( HOME.L ) and Kesa KESA.L in the frame. Separately, The Mail on Sunday newspaper reported without citing sources that Archie Norman and Allan Leighton, who engineered the turnaround of supermarket chain Asda in the 1990s, had been approached to join Sainsbury's management in the event that a bid is successful.
