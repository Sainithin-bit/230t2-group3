 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Michael Dell plans to remain the chief executive of Dell Inc. DELL.O for "several years," he said in an e-mail sent to the company on Friday afternoon and posted on the Web site of the Austin American-Statesman newspaper. 


 Dell reclaimed the reins of the company he founded when he replaced former CEO Kevin Rollins on Wednesday. Dell and Rollins, who also resigned his board membership, had worked as a team for over a decade, even sharing offices on either side of a glass wall. For several quarters, Dell has suffered market share losses to a reinvigorated Hewlett-Packard Co. ( HPQ.N ). As a result of a disappointing year, nobody in the company will receive bonuses this year, Dell wrote. "We had great efforts, but not great results. This is disappointing and unacceptable." The letter also described other management changes, including a reduction to 12 from more than 20 of the number of people reporting directly to the CEO and the creation of a "Global Operations" unit that will run manufacturing and procurement.
