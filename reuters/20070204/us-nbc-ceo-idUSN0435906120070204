 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Entertainment giant NBC Universal, a unit of General Electric Co. ( GE.N ), will announce this week a new, younger chief executive to help it better compete in the digital age, the Los Angeles Times newspaper reported on Sunday. 


 Jeff Zucker, 41 and a fast-rising NBC television executive, will replace Bob Wright after 21 years in which he built the TV network into a vast entertainment empire, the L.A. Times said, based on information from four people at the company. Zucker, who is CEO of NBC Universal Television Group and reports to Wright, made his name as the executive producer of NBC's morning show "Today." GE Chairman Jeffrey Immelt wants to shake up its entertainment unit and compete more aggressively against digital powers like Google Inc. ( GOOG.O ) and youth Web sites like MySpace, the newspaper said. Wright had wanted to remain chief executive until at least the end of the year, but Immelt had decided that Zucker was ready for the job and insisted Wright step down, the newspaper said. The transition could signal a cultural shift at NBC Universal. While Wright had a reputation for being brainy and serious, Zucker is known for his casual style and direct way of speaking, according to the article. At 26, Zucker became the youngest executive producer ever for "Today," and he is credited with building the show into the company's most profitable program. Zucker's ascent up the ranks of NBC Universal slowed when, as head of the company's West Coast operations in 2004, he failed to find hits to replace "Friends" and "Frasier." But by last fall, the network's roster of popular shows began to bulk up again, with "Sunday Night Football," "Heroes" and "The Office." Wright will stay on as chairman of NBC Universal during the transition. NBC Universal was not immediately available for comment. (Additional reporting by  Helen Chernikoff  in New York)
