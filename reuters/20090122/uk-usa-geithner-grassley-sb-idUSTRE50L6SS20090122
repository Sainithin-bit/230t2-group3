 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The senior Republican on the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday said that he would not try to delay or block a vote in the U.S. Senate to confirm Timothy Geithner as treasury secretary. 

 "We said we were not going to be a part of holding it up ... it's something that ought to be decided soon," Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa told reporters. Grassley voted in the Senate Finance Committee against Geithner's appointment to head the Treasury Department. The Senate could vote as early as Thursday to confirm Geithner.
