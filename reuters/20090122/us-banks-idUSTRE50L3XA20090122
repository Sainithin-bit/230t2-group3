 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A series of large U.S. regional banks said on Thursday rising credit losses led to lower fourth-quarter earnings, illustrating the breadth and depth of the nation's credit crisis and recession. 

 The Ohio lenders Fifth Third Bancorp ( FITB.O ), Huntington Bancshares Inc ( HBAN.O ) and KeyCorp ( KEY.N ) posted quarterly losses, as did credit card and banking company Capital One Financial Corp ( COF.N ) and Southeast lender SunTrust Banks Inc ( STI.N ). Profit fell at BB&T Corp ( BBT.N ) and Comerica Inc ( CMA.N ) and increased at New York's M&T Bank Corp ( MTB.N ). Results fell short of analysts' average forecasts except at BB&T, which matched the consensus, and M&T, which topped forecasts, according to Reuters Estimates. Comerica also announced job cuts and Huntington and SunTrust lowered their dividends. "We are under no illusions as to the severity of this credit cycle," SunTrust Chief Executive James Wells said. Banks are struggling as a troubled economy and tight credit make it harder for consumer and business borrowers to pay their debts and to refinance. Government efforts to jump-start lending are proving less successful than hoped as lenders preserve cash in anticipation of worse times ahead. "The environment is extraordinarily difficult," Fifth Third Chief Executive Kevin Kabat said on a conference call. OHIO BANKS SUFFER LOSSES Fifth Third's net loss applicable to shareholders was $2.18 billion, or $3.82 per share, compared with a profit of $16 million, or 3 cents, a year earlier. Nearly half the loss was to write off goodwill because the value of its banking business fell. The Cincinnati-based lender suffered disproportionate credit weakness in Michigan and Florida and Moody's Investors Service cut its credit rating. Fifth Third took over deposits of a failed Florida lender, Freedom Bank FBBF.OB, last fall. Cleveland-based KeyCorp said its net loss from continuing operations was $524 million, or $1.13 per share, compared with a profit of $22 million, or 6 cents, a year earlier. Results included a $420 million goodwill writedown and net charge-offs nearly tripled. Huntington's net loss was $440.4 million, or $1.20 per share, compared with a loss of $239.3 million, or 65 cents. Much of the loss was tied to the Columbus-based lender's relationship with Franklin Credit Management Corp, a New Jersey lender to borrowers with troubled credit. Huntington cut its dividend to a penny per share from 13.25 cents. OTHER LENDERS UNDER PRESSURE Capital One, based in McLean, Virginia, said it lost $1.45 billion, or $3.74 per share, compared with a profit of $226.6 million, or 60 cents, a year earlier. The company wrote off $810.9 million of goodwill for its auto finance business and added $1 billion to its reserve for loan losses. Atlanta-based SunTrust posted a loss of $379.2 million, or $1.08 per share, compared with a profit of $3.3 million, or 1 cent, a year earlier. Soured consumer, commercial and real estate loans caused net charge-offs to more than triple. The bank cut its dividend to 10 cents per share from 54 cents, the second reduction in three months. BB&T, based in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, said profit fell 31 percent to $284 million, or 51 cents per share. The bank nearly tripled reserves for credit losses, citing weakness in Florida, Georgia and the Washington, D.C., area. Comerica profit fell 97 percent to $3 million, or 2 cents per share, as net charge-offs more than doubled. The Dallas lender is also cutting 5 percent of its workforce, or about 509 jobs, and freezing salaries for the top 20 percent of its workforce. Buffalo-based M&T bucked the downward earnings trend. Profit rose 57 percent to $102.2 million, or 92 cents per share, although net charge-offs more than doubled. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc ( BRKa.N )( BRKb.N ) is among the bank's largest shareholders. In Thursday trading, shares of Fifth Third closed down 28.6 percent, KeyCorp rose 5.2 percent, Huntington fell 30.6 percent, SunTrust fell 10.9 percent, BB&T fell 0.3 percent, Comerica rose 9.3 percent and M&T fell 4.4 percent. Capital One fell 2.1 percent in after-hours trading following the release of results, after dropping 4.4 percent in regular trading.
