 STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - Top mobile phone maker Nokia reported fourth-quarter earnings and sales below market expectations on Thursday and said it expected the mobile handset market to contract about 10 percent this year. 

 Nokia shares fell on the news and were down 6.9 percent to 9.52 euros by 1120 GMT (6:20 a.m. EST). Following are views from analysts on the results: INGE HEYDORN, SENTAT ASSET MANAGEMENT "Expectations were low and yet Nokia missed them. Expectations have been lowered during the past months, although they had been raised a little bit after the reports from Ericsson and Apple, which were really good. I think it is a bit of a non-event, the market is tough for handsets." THOMAS LANGER, WEST LB "If you look at earnings per share, sales figures and the downwards revision of handset expectations, clearly we have to say it's a disappointment. It's only six-seven weeks after the capital markets day and again they have had to lower volume expectations." "Earnings per share is quite significantly below expectations. I think that Q1 will be a very poor quarter for Nokia given that they expect volumes to be down by 10 percent. The big inventory correction will take place early in the year and that should mostly effect Q1 and, to a lesser degree, Q2." RICHARD WINDSOR, NOMURA SECURITIES "The real problem here is that they are lowering their guidance again, and that's what's driving the stock." TRADER "Nokia's numbers have ruined the party and pulled down the stock market." MICHAEL SCHRODER, FIM "I think it was quite weak across the board, and even weaker than the lowered expectations in recent weeks." "Full year 2009 guidance is cut, and they warn for the first half of the year, so it's really not that good."
