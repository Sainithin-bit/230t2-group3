 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Southwest Airlines ( LUV.N ) on Thursday reported a quarterly net loss due to one-time charges related to its fuel-hedging program, and said it was seeing softness in bookings for this year as the recession eats away at demand for flights. 

 The U.S. No. 1 low-cost carrier, which has benefited from its far-sighted fuel-hedging program over the last few years, has been caught out by the rapid fall in oil prices, and said it now expects to pay 16 cents to 17 cents per gallon above market prices for jet fuel over the next three years. The Dallas-based airline said it has now scaled back its hedges to cover only about 10 percent of its fuel needs over the next five years, to counter the effects of current relatively low oil prices. Southwest reported a fourth-quarter net loss of $56 million, or 8 cents per share, compared with a profit of $111 million, or 15 cents per share, a year earlier. That loss included $117 million of charges for adjusting the market value of its fuel hedging portfolio. Excluding those charges, the company said it made a profit of $61 million, or 8 cents per share for the quarter, compared with $87 million, or 12 cents per share, a year ago. On that basis, Wall Street was expecting 5 cents per share profit, on average, according to Reuters Estimates. Looking forward, the airline said it has seen "notable softness" in post-January bookings, as the recession starts to take its toll on demand for business and leisure travel in the United States.
