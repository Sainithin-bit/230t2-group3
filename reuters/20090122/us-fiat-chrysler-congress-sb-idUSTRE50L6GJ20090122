 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A Democratic senator on Thursday urged President Barack Obama to require Chrysler CBS.UL to repay the federal bailout money it received if Italy's Fiat SpA ( FIA.MI ) should take a controlling stake in it. 

 Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey, a member of the Senate Banking Committee, said in a letter to Obama that American taxpayers should not prop up a foreign automaker. The Treasury Department agreed to provide a $4 billion loan to Chrysler LLC and another $1.5 billion loan to Chrysler Financial. Fiat said on Tuesday that it was planning to take a 35 percent stake in Chrysler in exchange for access to technology and overseas markets. "As a potential partnership between Chrysler and Fiat moves forward, I am asking you to address the potentiality of foreign control and require the immediate payback of the loans already dispersed should such a scenario present itself," Menendez wrote in the letter. A spokeswoman for Chrysler was not immediately available for comment. Menendez said he personally spoke with Chrysler Chief Executive Robert Nardelli about the possibility of a merger with Fiat. "Mr. Nardelli assured me that he would be supportive of such a requirement," Menendez wrote. (Reporting by  John Poirier ; Editing by  Gary Hill )
