 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Former Merrill Lynch Chief Executive John Thain has resigned from Bank of America Corp which recently acquired Merrill, effective immediately, a Bank of America spokesman said on Thursday. 

 The shakeup, which follows a report on CNBC about lavish spending by Thain redesigning his office at Merrill Lynch, is the latest earthquake to hit Bank of America, which earlier this month had to seek a government rescue. Bank of America shares were down 11 percent in early afternoon trading, making it one of the worst performing bank stocks on a day when the sectoral KBW Banks index was down 6.1 percent. The following are reactions from industry analysts and investors: DAVID DIETZE, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, POINT VIEW FINANCIAL SERVICES, SUMMIT NJ "This is a huge crisis of credibility at arguably America's largest bank. "(Losses at Merrill) were not disclosed on a timely basis to shareholders ... someone has to fall on a sword. "I guess it's not going to be Lewis -- in fairness to him, it wasn't his company being bought, it was Thain's." WILLIAM SMITH, CEO OF SMITH ASSET MANAGEMENT, NEW YORK "John Thain saved Merrill Lynch. Crucify him if you must, but he sold Ken Lewis a bill of goods, and Ken Lewis bought it. He saved Merrill and took care of his boys on his way out. I'm not saying he didn't take advantage of this situation. "What's great is, Lewis is going in the wrong direction. He's making a financial supermarket, and the supermarket model does not work. If they can make it through this, two to three years from now we'll see an IPO of Merrill Lynch. "At the end of the day, we'll go back to how it used to be, banks are banks, brokers are brokers, and investment banks are investment banks." MICHAEL HOLLAND, FOUNDER OF HOLLAND & CO, OVERSEES MORE THAN $4 BILLION, NEW YORK "It shows how quickly things have deteriorated since September 15, when this deal was struck. Back in September, this seemed to be a very smart acquisition by Bank of America. "With the major change in the assets value in the past three months the whole Bank of America/Merrill Lynch looks so differently, and Thain is a victim of that process. "There is no way it can be positive for Ken Lewis. He was the decision maker, so this is not a good outcome for him personally, as it is not a good outcome for John Thain, so there are no winners in this situation." MARSHALL FRONT, A BANKING ANALYST AND CHAIRMAN OF FRONT BARNETT ASSOCIATES LLC IN CHICAGO. "(Thain's departure) is not surprising given the enormous deterioration in Merrill's business. "The Merrill transaction, the speed with which it was done, and the lack of adequate due diligence raises questions." MATT MCCORMICK, BANKING ANALYST AND PORTFOLIO MANAGER AT BAHL & GAYNOR INVESTMENT COUNSEL, CINCINNATI "We're seeing a new tone on Wall Street that extravagant behavior won't be tolerated anymore. Merrill and Bank of America are in cost-cutting and consolidation mode -- this was a catalyst to push Thain out. Any executive in a financial services entity at a C-level is going to have to rejustify his existence in this TARP environment where every penny counts. "Because Lewis just bought shares to send a signal, his position is more solid -- he is sending the signal he plans to be around, and he's consolidating his power -- he is setting a new tone." JACK ABLIN, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, HARRIS PRIVATE BANK, CHICAGO "After that $15 billion debacle, I wasn't surprised. To me this is an expected consequence of that loss. It's generated a whole furor among shareholders. "The problem is this could be a great investment because it's certainly a bargain, but now there is at least a scenario out there of nationalization. Despite the fact that (Bank of America) stock is remarkably cheap by traditional measures, the investment is still fraught with risk because of a potential for nationalization or the need for dilutive capital raising."
