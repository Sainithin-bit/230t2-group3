 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Corporations spanning industries from technology to entertainment unveiled plans for more job cuts, cost reductions and internal overhauls on Wednesday, as the U.S. economy remains mired in recession. 

 With an estimated 2.5 million to 3 million job losses announced or executed since the start of the economic downturn, economists expect even more to come as companies struggle to hold up margins, sustain growth or -- in some cases -- survive. "It is a very intense economic downturn and businesses are increasingly in survival mode," said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Economy.com. "Survival mode means preserving cash and in turn that means job cuts. We are going to see a few more months of half-million in job losses, regardless of what kind of government stimulus we get. In terms of the job cuts, we are seeing the worst of the job declines now." One of the main questions on executives' -- and employees' -- minds is how much longer the pain will last. "We're not quite half-way through the job losses that we expect during this recession," said Anna Piretti, senior economist at BNP Paribas in New York. "The labor market tends to lag developments in the real economy and in GDP quite substantially." "Since the recession started we lost about 2.5 million jobs, and we're likely to lose another 3 million going forward." INTEL CORP ( INTC.O ) The world's largest chip maker will shut plants in Malaysia and the Philippines and scale back its U.S. operations, cutting as many as 6,000 jobs. Some workers will be offered positions at other facilities. The firm employed about 84,000 at the end of 2008. The restructuring will take place between now and the end of the year. Intel, which is slashing prices on some of its microprocessors by nearly half, last week reported a decline in fourth-quarter revenue but said it expected gross margins to climb back to "healthy" levels in the second half. EATON CORP ( ETN.N ) The diversified U.S. manufacturer, trying to slash costs, intends to lay off 5,200 people. Combined with 3,400 job cuts announced in 2008's second half, the company will have reduced its workforce by a 10th. WALT DISNEY CO ( DIS.N ) The media and entertainment giant decided to send voluntary buyout offers to 600 executives at its domestic theme parks, and warned it could resort to layoffs if not enough people accepted its offers. The buyout offers come just six weeks after the company told markets that hotel bookings had begun to rebound as a result of discounts, and appear to be part of the "significant" cost savings Disney promised investors in late 2008. UNITED TECHNOLOGIES ( UTX.N ) The world's largest maker of elevators and air-conditioners plans to run up $150 million in restructuring expenses by laying off an unspecified number of workers, warning of a tough first half. SPX ( SPW.N ) The maker of cooling towers for electric plants and equipment for oil and gas production intends to reduce its workforce by at least 400 people this year, bringing total job cuts over 2008 and 2009 to 1,700, or 10 percent of its staff. WILLIAMS-SONOMA ( WSM.N ) The home furnishings retailer plans to slash 18 percent of its full-time workforce and close a call center and distribution facility. It hopes to save $75 million in costs by cutting expenses on overhead such as production, information technology and logistics. BROWN SHOE CO INC ( BWS.N ) The footwear retailer hopes to save $22 million annually through layoffs and closing 30 to 35 of its Famous Footwear stores in 2009. It has offered a voluntary separation package to U.S. employees but plans also to start involuntary layoffs within two weeks. CHILDREN'S PLACE RETAIL STORES INC ( PLCE.O ) The firm hopes to cut 350 jobs and relocate its e-commerce business to Alabama from New Jersey, citing a lack of space at its current location. PHILLIPS-VAN HEUSEN ( PVH.N ) The clothing and accessories company slashed about 250 jobs, or about 10 percent of its salaried workforce, as part of an internal overhaul that will help it save $40 million a year. The company also trimmed its fourth-quarter earnings forecast. PATRIOT COAL CORP PCX.N The U.S. coal producer will idle its Remington and Black Oak mines and reduce activity at the Rocklick preparation facility, triggering about 400 job cuts. F5 NETWORKS ( FFIV.O ) The network equipment maker, while offering a second-quarter outlook that exceeded expectations, plans to cut 5 to 7 percent of its workforce in the second-quarter ending March, blaming a sudden drop-off in North American sales during December's final week.
