 LONDON  (Reuters) - World stocks halved earlier gains after disappointing fourth-quarter earnings results from Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ), while European government bonds fell on concerns that their countries may borrow more to boost the economy. 

 The yen rose toward a 13-1/2 year high against the dollar and a seven-year peak versus the euro, while sterling fell again toward the previous day's 23-year low against the dollar. Top cell phone maker Nokia reported underlying Q4 earnings per share of 0.26 euros, below the forecast of 0.30 euros. The firm also warned market volumes would shrink some 10 percent this year. "Nokia's numbers have ruined the party and pulled down the stock market," a trader said. World stocks are still up from this week's seven-week low thanks to Wednesday's surprisingly healthy earnings reports from IBM ( IBM.N ), Apple ( AAPL.O ) and Northern Trust ( NTRS.O ) and rebounding banking and energy shares. "We've had so much bad news recently that a bounce is always inevitable, given the extent of the losses, people have been overdoing the gloom," said Peter Dixon, economist at Commerzbank. The MSCI world equity index .MIWD00000PUS was up 0.6 percent, after rising more than 1 percent earlier. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading European shares  .FTEU3  was up 0.7 percent, also coming off highs. Emerging stocks .MSCIEF rose 0.7 percent. U.S. stock futures were down 0.4 percent, pointing to a weaker open on Wall Street. U.S. crude oil rose 0.5 percent to $43.78 a barrel. The dollar lost 0.6 percent to 88.87 yen after falling as low as 87.10 yen on Wednesday, the lowest since July 1995. Sterling was down 1.6 percent at $1.3759, having hit $1.3618 on Wednesday, its lowest since September 1985. The British currency has fallen around 6 percent this week. The dollar .DXY rose 0.4 percent against a basket of major currencies. GOVERNMENT DEBT CONCERNS Government bonds were under pressure across the board as investors unwound safer trades as stocks rebounded. Also pressuring sovereign debt is concerns that the governments would have to borrow huge amounts to help fund their packages designed to support the economy. The euro zone's second largest economy, France, sold a total of 7.485 billion euros of government bonds on Thursday. Worries about fiscal balance have driven the cost of insuring sovereign debt of many major economies to record highs in recent sessions, according to credit default swaps data. Investors are also demanding more compensation to hold less liquid euro zone debt than benchmark German government bonds. Spreads of French 10-year bonds over German Bunds are around 60 basis points, their widest since the introduction of the euro. Portugal became the third euro zone economy this year to be hit by a ratings downgrade late on Wednesday, as Standard & Poor's cut its long-term rating to A+ from AA-, citing slow economic reforms and deteriorating public finances. The 10-year Portuguese/Bund spread hit a new wide of 153 basis points on Wednesday. The March bund futures fell 45 ticks. (Additional reporting by  Blaise Robinson ; Editing by  Andy Bruce )
