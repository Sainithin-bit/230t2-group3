 WARSAW  (Reuters) - Poland's gas monopoly PGNiG PGN.WA plans to cut expenses and sell non-core assets to offset the rising cost of Russian gas imports and to ready itself for a planned freeing of central and Eastern Europe's largest gas market. 
 The state-controlled group's chief executive told Reuters in an interview that it would publish a two-year strategy in October assuming plans to cut costs, consolidate its units and spin off assets. "We must put a cap on costs to account for an unfavorable gas tariff, the necessity to invest and reduce debt," Grazyna Piotrowska-Oliwa said.
