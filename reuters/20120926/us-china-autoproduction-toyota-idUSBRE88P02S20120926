 BEIJING  (Reuters) - Japanese car-maker Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ) is likely to slow production in China as anti-Japan sentiment there hurts sales, a Toyota executive said on Wednesday. 
 The executive, who declined to be named because any public comments were meant to be made via an official statement, said a report by Japan's Asahi newspaper that it would completely halt China production in October was "not quite true". Toyota is expected to make a statement later on Wednesday. (Reporting by Norihiko Shirouzu; Editing by  Mark Bendeich )
