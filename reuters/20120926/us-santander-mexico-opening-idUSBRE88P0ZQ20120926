 MEXICO CITY  (Reuters) - Shares of the Mexican affiliate of Spanish bank Santander ( SANMEXB.MX ) rose 2 percent in early trading on Wednesday after the company priced its multi-billion dollar offering the previous session. 
 Banco Santander ( SAN.MC ) is raising more than $4 billion in a dual-country offering of its Mexican affiliate's shares to help the bank shore up its operations in the ailing Spanish economy. The offering, the largest ever by a Mexico-listed company, was priced at 31.25 pesos in Mexico on Tuesday. The New York-listed shares ( BSMX.N ) traded at $12.63.
