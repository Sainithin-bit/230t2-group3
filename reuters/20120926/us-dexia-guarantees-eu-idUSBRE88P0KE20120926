 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - The European Commission said on Wednesday it had approved a four-month extension of temporary state guarantees to Franco-Belgian Dexia ( DEXI.BR ). 
 France, Belgium and Luxembourg have provided up to 55 billion euros ($71.29 billion) of guarantees to cover the funding of Dexia, which was bailed out for a second time in three years in October 2011. The EU's approval was due to expire at the end of September. It will now run until January 31, 2013. ($1 = 0.7715 euros) (Reporting by  Ethan Bilby , writing by Philip Blenkinsop)
