 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co said on Monday it will buy Marvel Entertainment Inc for $4 billion, striking the biggest media deal of the year. 

 Here are some key facts about Marvel: * The company has a library of more than 5,000 characters and has been publishing comic books since 1939. * Marvel has more than a 40 percent market share in comics, graphic novels and magazine publishing, according to a spokesman. * Its stable of superheroes include Iron Man, the X-Men, the Incredible Hulk, the Fantastic Four and its first blockbuster character, Captain America. * Spider-Man, whose theatrical rights have been licensed to Sony Pictures, is considered the company's most popular character. * Many of its characters were created by comic book legends Stan Lee, Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko. * Marvel enjoyed blockbuster success with "Iron Man," its first self-produced film. Distributed by Viacom's Paramount Pictures and released in 2008, the movie pulled in the second-biggest non-sequel box office opening in history. * It is currently working on "Iron Man 2," a sequel set for release in 2010. * Marvel's shares soared in August when it posted a second-quarterly profit that beat market estimates, boosted by DVD and pay TV sales of blockbuster "Iron Man." * Marvel posted $676 million in revenue in 2008, up 39 percent from $486 million in revenue in 2007. * The company had $221 million in net profit in 2008, up about 35 percent from $164 million in 2007. * The company had $938 million in total assets at the end of 2008. * For 2009, Marvel forecast earnings of $1.25 a share to $1.35 a share, on revenue of $465 million to $485 million. * The company is headquartered in New York City but has corporate offices in London and Manhattan Beach, California. It has about 300 employees. * Total market capitalization reached more than $3 billion in 2009. * Before the deal with Disney, 2009 had been a lull for Marvel as it is not releasing any films of its own this year. * Upcoming projects include: "Thor" and the first "Avenger" movie, as well as Sony-produced "Spider-Man 4" slated for a 2011 release. The "Avengers" sequel will follow in 2012. * Marvel's primary competitor is DC Comics, the company behind the "Watchmen" characters. DC Comics is a subsidiary of Warner Bros, which is owned by Time Warner Inc. * It operates three divisions: licensing, film production through Marvel Studios, Marvel Animation and publishing via Marvel Comics. * Marvel has a monthly circulation of more than 4.1 million.
