 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Total U.S. construction spending fell 0.2 percent in July to the lowest rate since February 2004, Commerce Department data showed on Tuesday, despite residential construction making its biggest gain since September and federal building reaching a record pace. 

 Analysts polled by Reuters had expected construction spending to remain unchanged from June. June's rise was revised down to 0.1 percent from the originally reported 0.3 percent. Private residential construction increased 2.3 percent in July after dropping 0.5 percent in June. It was the largest rise since last September, when it increased 3 percent. With a hefty push from the U.S. economic stimulus plan, federal building rose 0.8 percent to a record $29.57 billion seasonally adjusted annual rate. Still, that was not enough to keep all public construction from decreasing 0.7 percent in its first monthly decline since January. (Reporting by  Lisa Lambert , Editing by Andrea Ricci)
