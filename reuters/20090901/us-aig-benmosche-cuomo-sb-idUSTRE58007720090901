 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - American International Group said its CEO regretted comments he made about New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, after it was reported he said Cuomo "doesn't deserve to be in government" and acted as a "criminal." 

 The insurer's statement was in response to a Bloomberg report that quoted Robert Benmosche, who took the reins earlier this month, criticizing Cuomo's handling of retention bonuses given to AIG staff. "What he did is so unbelievably wrong," Benmosche said of Cuomo at a town-hall style meeting with employees August 11, according to a record obtained and quoted by Bloomberg. "He doesn't deserve to be in government, and he surely shouldn't be the attorney general of the state of New York," the CEO reportedly continued. "What he did is criminal. You don't create lynch mobs to go out to people's homes and do the things he did." The meeting with employees in Houston came a day after Benmosche was installed as CEO of the struggling company, which was on the verge of collapse when the U.S. government bailed it out last year. It now aims to pay off more than $80 billion in taxpayer loans. In March, New York's top legal officer issued subpoenas to AIG after it was revealed the company paid more than $165 million in bonuses to employees. Cuomo asked for the names, amounts and details of the contracts, but his office did not publicly release the names. "Mr. Benmosche regrets his comments regarding Mr. Cuomo and the tone of those comments," AIG spokeswoman Christina Pretto said in an email, without confirming or denying the report. "Mr. Benmosche now recognizes that the New York Attorney General resisted public pressure to disclose the names of AIG employees during the controversy in March regarding compensation, and with emotions running high, he noted the importance of all parties to proceed with care and sober judgment." The spokeswoman added that Benmosche, the company's fifth CEO since 2005, has held several meetings in which U.S. employees "have repeatedly voiced concerns about the threats and harassment they have experienced." Cuomo spokesman Richard Bamberger declined to comment on the report. (Reporting by Jonathan Spicer; Editing by  Gary Hill )
