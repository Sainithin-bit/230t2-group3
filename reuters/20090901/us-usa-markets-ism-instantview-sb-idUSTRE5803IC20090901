 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. manufacturing sector grew in August in the first month of expansion in more than a year and a half, according to an industry report released on Tuesday. 

 KEY POINTS: * The Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity rose to 52.9 in August from 48.9 in July. The median forecast of 78 economists surveyed by Reuters was for a reading of 50.5. * A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector. The last time the index showed growth in the sector was in January 2008 with a reading of 50.8. PENDING HOME SALES: Pending sales of previously owned U.S. homes raced to a two-year high in July, a real estate trade group said on Tuesday, providing more evidence the housing market was on a steady recovery path. KEY POINTS: * The National Association of Realtors said its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed in July, rose 3.2 percent to 97.6, the highest level since June 2007, from 94.6 in June. Pending home sales contracts have risen for a record six straight months. CONSTRUCTION SPENDING Total U.S. construction spending fell 0.2 percent in July to the lowest rate since February 2004, Commerce Department data showed on Tuesday, despite residential construction making its biggest gain since September and federal building reaching a record pace. KEY POINTS: * Analysts polled by Reuters had expected construction spending to remain unchanged from June. June's rise was revised down to 0.1 percent from the originally reported 0.3 percent. * Private residential construction increased 2.3 percent in July after dropping 0.5 percent in June. It was the largest rise since last September, when it increased 3 percent. * With a hefty push from the U.S. economic stimulus plan, federal building rose 0.8 percent to a record $29.57 billion seasonally adjusted annual rate. Still, that was not enough to keep all public construction from decreasing 0.7 percent in its first monthly decline since January. COMMENTS: DAN FARETTA, SENIOR MARKET STRATEGIST, LIND-WALDOCK, CHICAGO: "The ISM numbers are better-than-expected. It's a big number for us. It went from contraction to expansion which is a positive numbers for the jobs in the future. If we can stay at the expanding rate, we can create more jobs, and this will be positive on the economy. "The August manufacturing numbers can be also seen as a change of trend. Nothing goes up straight, but the majority of ISM numbers we expect to see in the future will be expansion rather than contraction. "The housing numbers can be more volatile than manufacturing numbers. The initial bounce in the market now is all based on the ISM numbers." ALAN LANCZ, PRESIDENT, ALAN B. LANCZ & ASSOCIATES INC., TOLEDO, OHIO: "It's a favorable number. It falls in line with the rally this summer where investors are expecting the economy has turned. It's another that, not only have we bottomed, there might be expansion ahead, which is important for the markets to continue their rally." MICHELLE MEYER, ECONOMIST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL, NEW YORK: "Pending home sales jumped 3.2 percent month-over-month in July to the highest level since June 2007 and greatly exceeding expectations. Home sales have increased for six consecutive months, the first time this has occurred in the history of the series, which goes back to 2001. The sharp upturn in home sales has been driven by the combination of greater affordability, a brighter economic outlook and the first-time home buyer tax credit." STEPHEN MASSOCCA, MANAGING DIRECTOR, WEDBUSH MORGAN, SAN FRANCISCO: "Well, it all pretty much looked better than expected. I don't know how much better than expected. You got your ISM over 50, which is something that had been expected, a little more than expected. Construction spending was a little down. The survey was break-even but I did see some numbers looking for a decline, so I don't know how disappointing that really is. Then of course in the wake of China bouncing yesterday you're set up for a little bit of a rut. It will be interesting to see if the market can continue to move higher on this slightly better economic news, it's starting to lose its impact. "The real news today will be how the market reacts as opposed to the actual numbers that came out because the drumbeat has been you've gotten better-than-expected economic numbers and the market has rallied and over the last couple of weeks that has started to not be true. You've seen days where numbers have come out and the market has been flat or down a little bit. If at the end of the day we're up 150 points based on these numbers that tells you it hasn't lost its impact yet. The combination of these numbers and what happened in China last night, you could be in for a decent rally today." BRIAN KIM, CURRENCY STRATEGIST, UBS, STAMFORD, CONNECTICUT: "Equities are reacting well to U.S. data and so is dollar/yen. Euro/dollar is also gaining. The trend of positive data and weaker dollar is still intact, with risk appetite on the rise once again. The reports affirm the view that the U.S. economy is definitely improving. Home sales are continuing to trend higher and we think we have already seen the bottom in the housing market. The ISM, meanwhile, continues to improve and this is all good for risk sentiment." JONATHAN BASILE, ECONOMIST, CREDIT SUISSE, NEW YORK: "Both reports are encouraging readings. I'm particularly encouraged by new orders and spread between new orders and shipments. The manufacturing recession is over. This is not necessarily a one-month event. This suggests manufacturing activity will be picking up. "Autos are up because of 'cash for clunkers' but there are no special mentions in other sectors. This is good news for third-quarter growth and for the jobs picture." FIRAS ASKARI, HEAD OF CURRENCY TRADING, BMO CAPITAL MARKETS, TORONTO: "The stronger ISM headline number, along with prices paid and new home sales, should be good for the 'risk-on' side of the balance sheet, which has been listing for a while. But at the end of the day, the market is still in wait-and-see mode. "We're getting jostled around by every piece of data that comes out and I don't think there's a consensus that this economy has legs. You can make an argument either way, but the best we can do now is wait. I don't think anybody really knows, which is why I advocate keeping positions small and close to home." LINDA DUESSEL, MARKET STRATEGIST, FEDERATED INVESTORS, PITTSBURGH: "The ISM is an important benchmark that investors look at when trying to sense the trend of the economy. We've had numerous regional ISM reports in the past several weeks, not only in the U.S. but around the globe, that suggested expansion. It was believed that we'd show 50-52 this month, showing 52.9 is that much better. "The pending home sales were also much better than expected. Both cases, the home sales and ISM, are continued information for investors who are worried that we should expect a pullback. This is tough one for the bears. A lot of the bears want to believe the green shoots will wither and fade while the bullish ones think the market has gotten ahead of itself. This data makes it hard to see September as being the negative that people were expecting." KEVIN FLANAGAN, FIXED INCOME STRATEGIST FOR GLOBAL WEALTH MANAGEMENT, MORGAN STANLEY, PURCHASE, NEW YORK: "The ISM report continues the steady diet of improving economic numbers we have been receiving with respect to third quarter economic growth, we can say now. "Treasuries are responding in adverse fashion. Before, they were flow driven as flows moved out of some risk assets, including stocks and corporate bonds." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stock indexes rose. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices added to losses. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar fell against the euro, but rose against the yen.
