 LONDON  (Reuters) - Global equities have yet to price in an improving economic growth outlook, suggesting further gains even after the heady showing of December and early January. 

 Modest valuations, swifter economic growth and robust company earnings are expected to deliver higher returns in stocks in 2011, leading some analysts to believe it is not time to bet against the consensus view. This is despite the risks of euro zone debt crisis, policy overshoot in China and earlier-than-expected tightening in the United States. Equities would appear to be in a "sweet spot" as global interest rates remain low and with at least a six-month window before the U.S. Federal Reserve is seen ready to even think about a rate rise. But investors have not fully embraced this. "The double dip (recession) has been taken out of the price clearly but at the same time there are still a lot of investors who are cautious on the outlook," said Robert Parkes, equity strategist at HSBC in London. "We don't think the market is overvalued. We see the market is still on the cheap side. We don't think the improving macro outlook is in the price." A Reuters poll in early December showed the U.S. S&P 500  .SPX  was expected to rise by a median 8.3 percent by the end of 2011, Britain's FTSE 100  .FTSE  by 8.5 percent and Germany's DAX  .GDAXI  by 8.9 percent. But a lot of that has already come. The S&P 500 returned 6.5 percent in its best December performance since 1991, while the benchmark STOXX Europe 600 .STOXX added 5.4 percent. So far this year, the two are up 1.5 percent and more than 2.5 percent, respectively. The S&P 500 still carries a one-year forward price-to-earnings ratio of 13 times versus a 10-year average of 15.6, while the STOXX Europe 600 has a 12-month forward P/E of 10.4 times against a 10-year average of 13.3, Thomson Reuters Datastream shows. The latest Reuters asset allocation poll also shows investors entered the new year in a relatively bullish mood, raising equity holdings to a 10-month high. "SWEET SPOT" "There is a six-month window that the outlook remains positive. The Fed is likely to want to see an extended period of better growth to create some employment to make sure the recovery is locked in," said Mark Bon, fund manager at Canada Life in London. Bon said valuations in some sectors, such as engineering and automakers, were overextended and could suffer a bout of profit taking, which could bring the overall market down a bit in the short-term. However, the favorable economic backdrop, undemanding valuations and the fund flows to stocks from bonds would support the market and the eventual rotation to better valued shares would help get the market higher again, he said. The fund manager expects undervalued sectors such as food retail and oil to outperform, and he likes Dutch grocer Ahold ( AHLN.AS ) and Spanish oil firm Repsol ( REP.MC ). ING Investment Management also favors the oil sector, and expects cyclical stocks, whose performance is closely related to the overall economy, to outperform in the short term because of the strong momentum in the economy. However, it would look to switch to high-dividend and defensive stocks, such as telecoms, later in the year as positive earnings momentum surprises may decelerate and emerging countries start to cool their robust growth, said Ad van Tiggelen, senior strategist at ING Investment Management. "I don't think it's wise to bet against equities at these valuations, with the economy rebounding and while still in the sweet spot of fiscal and monetary stimulus," Van Tiggelen said. YOU WANT TO BE A CONTRARIAN? Sometimes when markets agree what might be the likely outcome, there is a temptation to move in the opposite direction. But Nick Tranter, head of derivatives at Espirito Santo in London, said it was "the worst time" to make a contrarian bet. "There is a flow of fund argument, there is an asset allocation argument ... We probably have got more earnings growth to come through in this cycle and a lot of the demons of the sovereign debt issue seem to have been contained," he said. There is danger that in such a bullish mood people are becoming complacent about risks such as the euro zone debt crisis. But if investors were concerned of downside risk, they can, at little cost, buy index put options, which bet on weaker markets, and long implied volatility as protection, Tranter said. Volatility measured by VIX .VIX in the United States and Germany's VDAX-NEW .V1XI tends to rise when shares fall. (Graphics by Vincent Flasseur and Scott Barber; Editing by David Cowell)
