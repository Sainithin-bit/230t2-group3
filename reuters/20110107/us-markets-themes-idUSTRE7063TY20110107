 LONDON  (Reuters) - Following are five big themes likely to dominate thinking of investors and traders in the coming week and the Reuters stories related to them. 

 1. RISK ON! Investors have come back from holidays with cash to put to work and a healthier appetite for riskier assets. Stocks are up, commodity prices remain elevated and growth-linked currencies, such as the Canadian dollar, and emerging market currencies, such as the Brazilian real, are firmer. Much of the change in sentiment is due to an improved U.S. economic outlook after a string of stronger data. U.S. payrolls data was weaker than expected but the unemployment rate hit a 1-1/2 year low so, with monetary policy ultra-loose across much of the developed world, pro-risk trades look set to continue. A strong correlation between strong U.S. data and weaker dollar seems to be breaking, as both commodities and stocks have responded positively and moved higher. The euro zone debt crisis remains a fly in the ointment but company earnings in the week ahead will be watched for further signs of strength. 2. TESTING APPETITE Investors' focus will swing back to the euro zone's more indebted member states with Portugal -- widely seen as next in line for a bailout -- returning to the bond market on Wednesday, and Italy and Spain due to sell bonds on Thursday, in the year's first test of investor appetite for debt from the currency bloc's periphery. Although peripheral bond yields are off their recent record highs, they ground upwards throughout December and remain elevated by historical standards. Any signs of investor reluctance to purchase bonds could push yields higher again, making the cost of raising funds unsustainable for some governments. The euro will remain hostage to the euro zone's debt problems with investors likely to avoid the single currency on any fresh signs of stress. With peripheral debt spreads making some FX investors nervous, disappointing bond auctions could be used as an excuse to sell the euro. 3. EARNINGS SEASON The quarterly results season kicks off in the United States next week, with Alcoa, Intel and JPMorgan Chase among the first to report. JPMorgan's results, which should improve from the third quarter as the global economic outlook has brightened, will give a taste of what may follow from other major U.S. and European banks. Banesto will kick off Spanish lenders' reporting season and may show how much more pain they will have to bear as the country struggles to climb out of recession and contain a mounting deficit. Belgium's KBC is the latest to say it has suffered hefty losses from bad loans at its Irish business, indicating there could be more fallout from European banks' exposure to the euro zone peripheral economies. 4. STOCKING UP With many banks and brokers expecting equities to deliver strong gains this year, it may bring out the contrarian instinct in some investors as world stocks hit a fresh 27-month high in the first week of 2011. But it may pay to be cautious. A steadily improving economic outlook, strong company earnings and balance sheets, cheap valuations and a low interest rate environment as well as strong market momentum mean it may not be a good time to bet against equities at least in the next two quarters. World stocks ended the year more than 10 percent higher and are up 0.7 percent so far this year. 5. DOLLAR REBOUND - CAN IT LAST? The dollar has bounced this year and looks set to garner more support from investors with new budgets to play with. With growing optimism about a U.S. recovery and many investors running short dollar positions, a dose of good news could see many start reversing those holdings and go long. The greenback may chiefly benefit against the euro with risk-reversals still skewed toward the downside for the single currency. Some in the market are considering expressing a bullish view on the dollar by going long on the U.S. currency against the Swiss franc. The European Central Bank and the Bank of England meet in the coming week. Both are expected to stand pat on rates and while the ECB still has a debt problem on its hands, the BoE faces a dilemma of sticky inflation and, though not part of its mandate, uncertain economic recovery in 2011. Traders might take the view that the dollar's rebound could last a while. (Compiled by Nigel Stephenson; Editing by  Catherine Evans )
