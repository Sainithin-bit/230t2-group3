 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - White House economic adviser Austan Goolsbee said on Friday that the U.S. jobless rate is still unacceptably high, although the overall trend of economic data has been encouraging. 

 "The overall trend of economic data over the past several months has been encouraging, due in large part to the initiatives passed by this administration, but we still have a ways to go," Goolsbee said in a White House blog post after a report showed the economy created only 103,000 new jobs in December while the jobless rate dropped to 9.4 percent from 9.8 percent.
