 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Consumer credit rose in November for the second straight month after 20 months of declines, the Federal Reserve said on Friday. 

 Total credit outstanding rose $1.35 billion in November, close to expectations in a Reuters poll. Credit in October rose a revised $7 billion, previously reported up $3.4 billion. Consumers began spurning this short- and intermediate-term debt in August 2008, with declines in 24 of the 26 months through September 2010.
