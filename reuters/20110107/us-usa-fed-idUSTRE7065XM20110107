 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Leading economists have boosted their outlook for interest rates on benchmark Treasury debt in tandem with rising expectations for growth in the world's largest economy, a Reuters poll found on Friday. 

 The median of forecasts from 17 of 18 primary dealers is for benchmark 10-year Treasury note yields to climb from the current level near 3.33 percent to 3.50 percent by the end of the second quarter of this year. A similar poll conducted on December 14 had a median forecast of 3.35 percent for the same time frame, while a poll conducted on December 3 had a median forecast of a 3 percent 10-year yield by the middle of the year. Expectations for growth also rose marginally in the latest poll, with the median of forecasts from 17 primary dealers pegging annualized gross domestic product of 3.10 percent in 2011. The median in the December 14 poll was 3.05 percent, up from 3 percent in the December 3 poll. As a comparison, the most recent government estimate pegged economic growth at an annual rate of 2.6 percent in the third quarter of 2010. Stronger growth was not expected to spur the Federal Reserve to boost interest rates any time soon however, with 15 of 17 primary dealers saying the central bank will maintain rates at the current level near zero through all of 2011.
