 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A Manhattan federal judge has ordered Visa USA to stop charging a special fee that penalized debit card issuers for jumping to smaller rival MasterCard Inc. ( MA.N ). 

 Shares of MasterCard, which had been up 2 percent, rose an additional 3.5 percent after the company issued an afternoon statement about the ruling. They closed up $4.17, or 3 percent, at $143.58 on the New York Stock Exchange. Judge Barbara Jones agreed with a court-appointed adviser that Visa's "settlement service fee" was anti-competitive. She ordered Visa to allow any of its top 100 debit card issuers to terminate its agreement with the card association, so long as the issuer separately agreed to issue MasterCard debit cards. Visa had been charging the fee to issuers that moved their portfolios to MasterCard. The fee was intended to cover part of Visa's $2 billion settlement in 2003 of a antitrust class-action lawsuit by Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) and other retailers. MasterCard settled that case for $1 billion. "It appears to be a major win for MasterCard's domestic debit business, which trails Visa by a significant margin, but has now been presented with a golden opportunity to capture some of Visa's top customers," wrote Calyon Securities analyst Craig Maurer. He rates MasterCard "add." Jones wrote that "because banks make the brand-switching decision 'at the margin,' the settlement service fee is large enough in relation to MasterCard's incentive package to effectively prevent a bank from switching." Visa Vice President Rosetta Jones said her card association is studying the ruling and may appeal. "This is a significant win," MasterCard General Counsel Noah Hanft said in a statement. "With this roadblock out of the way, financial institutions (can) make decisions based on their best judgment about quality of service, strength of brand and other competitive factors." The 2003 settlement related to claims that retailers incurred billions of dollars of processing costs to meet card association requirements that they accept signature-verified debit cards. MasterCard is based in Purchase, New York, and Visa in San Francisco. MasterCard conducted its initial public offering in May 2006. Visa last October said it planned to go public within 12 to 18 months.
