 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - The unions representing 65,000 Southern California grocery workers threatened to strike if a new contract with three major supermarket chains is not completed by June 21. 

 In a statement issued late on Friday, the United Food and Commercial Workers unions said six months of negotiations was "more than enough time" for Safeway Inc.'s ( SWY.N ) Vons and Pavilions units, Kroger Co.'s ( KR.N ) Ralphs chain, and Supervalu Inc.'s ( SVU.N ) Albertsons business to reach a deal with the union. "Unless a deadline is set negotiations could drag on indefinitely," the union said, adding that it would hold member meetings beginning June 24 to either vote on a completed contract or ask for a strike authorization. A spokeswoman for the three grocery chains was not immediately available for comment. Talks between the union and the supermarkets center on wages and health coverage for workers who saw benefits reduced after a debilitating five-month labor dispute that devastated the industry in 2003 and 2004.
