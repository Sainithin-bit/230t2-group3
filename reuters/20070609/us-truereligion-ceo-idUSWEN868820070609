 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - True Religion Apparel Inc. TRLG.O, maker of high-end jeans, said on Friday its chairman and chief executive, Jeffrey Lubell, sold 2.3 million company shares on June 7 to fulfill obligations under his divorce agreement with Kymberly Gold-Lubell, the company's former vice president of women's design. 

 Following the sale, Lubell retains ownership of 6,421,066 shares, or about 22.4 percent, of the company's outstanding stock. Gold-Lubell, whose departure was announced in March, was True Religion's second-largest individual shareholder behind her husband.
