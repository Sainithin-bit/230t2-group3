 PORTLAND, Maine  (Reuters) - BP Plc ( BP.L ) slowed production at its oil refinery in Texas City, Texas, after a mechanical glitch, the company said in a filing with state environmental regulators on Saturday. 

 Processing rates from "several units" were cut to a minimum after a compressor failure, according to the filing with the Texas Commission for Environmental Quality. No BP officials were not immediately available to comment. The Texas City refinery has a capacity to process 460,000 barrels of crude oil per day but has been running at just over half that level since a deadly explosion and damage from hurricanes crippled parts of the plant in 2005.
