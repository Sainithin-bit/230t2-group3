 (Corrects spelling of product in last paragraph to Taboka) 

 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The maker of Marlboro, the top selling cigarette in the United States, is introducing a type of smokeless tobacco in August, as smoking bans spread and more smokers quit. Altria Group Inc.'s Philip Morris USA unit will launch the product, called Marlboro Snus, into the Dallas/Fort Worth area. Snus are small pouches of dried tobacco that users place in the mouth. Unlike chewing tobacco or so-called "dip," Snus do not require spitting. Marlboro Snus, modeled after products that are popular in Sweden, will come in four varieties -- rich, mild, mint and spice, according to a release e-mailed to Reuters on Friday. Last year Philip Morris USA introduced Taboka, another smoke-free, spit-free tobacco pouch, in a test market in Indianapolis.
