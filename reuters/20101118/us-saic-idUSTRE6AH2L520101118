 BEIJING  (Reuters) - SAIC Motor Corp said on Thursday that a Hong Kong-based subsidiary had bought a near 1 percent stake in General Motors Co as part of the U.S. automaker's initial public offering. 

 SAIC Motor HK Investment Ltd paid the $33 per share IPO price for 15.15 million shares, or about $500 million. GM said earlier on Thursday in a statement that it was happy with SAIC's decision to participate in the IPO. (Reporting by Fang Yan and Don Durfee; Editing by Will Waterman)
