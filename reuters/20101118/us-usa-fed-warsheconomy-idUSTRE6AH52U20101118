 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - A move by some U.S. Republican lawmakers to pare the Federal Reserve's mandate to a sole focus on price stability could distract the U.S. Congress from pursuing more pressing matters, a top Federal Reserve official said on Thursday. 

 "The Federal Reserve, since its founding, has always had price stability as one of its primary principle objectives," Federal Reserve Board Governor Kevin Warsh told a group of business leaders in Chicago, adding that the U.S. central bank takes that objective "exceptionally seriously." A debate in the U.S. Congress over the Fed's so-called dual mandate - which also includes the pursuit of maximum employment -- could keep lawmakers from more pressing issues including fiscal, trade, regulatory and tax policy, he said. "If it were to take oxygen away from what I believe are much more pressing issues," Warsh said, "it strikes me as not seizing the window of opportunity."
