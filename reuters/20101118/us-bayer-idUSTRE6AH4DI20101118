 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Bayer ( BAYGn.DE ), Germany's largest drugmaker, plans a 1 billion euro ($1.4 billion) cost cutting program to shift investment resources to its drugs and pesticides units and into emerging markets, it said on Thursday. 

 The group said 4,500 jobs would be cut and 2,500 new positions would be created in emerging markets by 2012 as part of the scheme, helping to save 800 million euros a year from 2013 onwards. "To finance the expansion of our growth activities, we ... need to redirect resources, improve efficiencies and cut costs," said Chief Executive Marijn Dekkers, less than two months after taking the helm. About half of the projected 800 million euros in annual savings is earmarked to shore up future investments, it added. "The focus will be on researching, developing and marketing new products, particularly in HealthCare and CropScience, and on expanding activities in the emerging markets," the company said. Parts of the 1 billion euro restructuring charge will be booked in the fourth quarter of this year, while the full amount will be incurred by end-2012, it added. (Reporting by  Ludwig Burger )
