 SHANGHAI, China  (Reuters) - Airbus will seek compensation from Rolls-Royce for any disruption caused by plans to re-assign engines in the wake of this month's Qantas A380 emergency, an Airbus spokesman said. He declined to say how many of the manufacturer's engines could have to be changed as a result of the engine blowout which forced a Qantas A380 to return to Singapore on November 4. 

 "We can't comment on customers but we can say that any cost Airbus incurs, we will seek full financial compensation from Rolls-Royce," the spokesman said by telephone from Toulouse. About 40 Rolls-Royce engines used in the world's fleet of Airbus A380 aircraft may need to be replaced to ensure safety after one such engine partly disintegrated mid-flight this month, Australia's Qantas said earlier. Airbus has said disruption caused by the incident could delay A380 deliveries in 2011. (Reporting by  Tim Hepher )
