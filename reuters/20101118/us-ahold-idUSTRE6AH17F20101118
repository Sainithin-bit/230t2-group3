 LONDON  (Reuters) - Dutch grocer Ahold ( AHLN.AS ) expects tough conditions in its main U.S. market to persist, it said on Thursday, as it missed forecasts with a 7.5 percent rise in third-quarter operating profit. 

 The group declined to comment on whether it was closer to identifying acquisition targets for its cash pile of more than 2 billion euros ($2.7 billion), though it said it was confident opportunities would arise and it would be able to seize them. Shares in Ahold, which runs Dutch market leader Albert Heijn but makes about 60 percent of sales in the United States, were down 3.1 percent at 9.61 euros by 0830 GMT, among the worst performing European blue-chip stocks. "Modestly disappointing," said Bernstein analyst Chris Hogbin, noting Ahold was still outperforming U.S. rivals and growing strongly in the Netherlands. He was also concerned the "window of opportunity" for acquisitions might be closing as economic conditions stabilize. Ahold chief executive John Rishton disagreed, saying weak competitors were getting weaker in a tough trading environment. "Opportunities will arise, and we'll take advantage of them," he told reporters, while declining to comment on reports Ahold might bid for Dutch retailer Hema. Despite renewed signs of economic recovery in the United States, the grocery market remains intensely competitive against a backdrop of high unemployment. Ahold's struggling rival Supervalu ( SVU.N ) last month announced a new round of price cuts. "Although many people continue to talk about the recession being over, that's not what we're seeing," Rishton said. "I wouldn't say it's getting worse, but it's certainly not getting better ... and I don't anticipate anything's going to change in the foreseeable future, certainly not in the fourth quarter." PROMOTIONS Ahold, which runs 2,900 stores in 11 countries, made an operating profit of 285 million euros ($385 million) in the 12 weeks ended October 10, below analysts' average forecast of 317 million in a Reuters poll. Same-store sales in the United States, where it trades as Stop & Shop, Giant-Landover and Giant-Carlisle, rose 0.6 percent, excluding fuel. That was better than the declines reported recently by Supervalu and Great Atlantic & Pacific (A&P) GAP.N, but below analysts' average forecast for a 1.2 percent increase. Rishton, who is leaving to head up British aero-engines maker Rolls-Royce in March and will be replaced by European boss Dick Boer, said the underlying U.S. retail operating margin was flat, excluding one-off factors. But promotional activity in the industry remained very high, he added. Dutch same-store sales, in contrast, were up a stronger-than-expected 4.5 percent. Rishton said that suggested concerns the group might suffer from Dutch rival Jumbo's acquisition of Super de Boer stores were "overhyped." Ahold has generally fared better than peers recently, thanks to a refocusing on lower prices before the economic downturn and strength in the more affluent northeast of the United States. But its shares have lagged the STOXX 600 European retail index .SXRP by 5 percent this year due to an uncertain U.S. outlook and concerns over how the group will spend its cash.
