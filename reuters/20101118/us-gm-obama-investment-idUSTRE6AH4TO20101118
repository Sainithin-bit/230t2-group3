 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The White House said on Thursday U.S. taxpayers were on track to recoup the full investment made by the Obama administration into General Motors. 

 White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said the administration hoped to make substantial progress to getting the U.S. government out of its GM shareholding by mid to late 2012. (Reporting by  Jeff Mason  and  Alister Bull , Editing by Sandra Maler)
