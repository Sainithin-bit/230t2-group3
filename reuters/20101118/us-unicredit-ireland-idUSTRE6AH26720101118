 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - UniCredit SpA ( CRDI.MI ) Chief Executive Federico Ghizzoni said he had "nightmares" over the euro zone debt crisis, in a rare public airing of the fears shared by many leading European bankers. 

 Ghizzoni said on Thursday that he was worried about Europe's ability urgently to address sovereign debt issues, with the region's credibility and the strength of the euro on the line. And while Europe had the tools needed to deal with the crisis, actions needed to be accelerated to restore calm to markets, said Ghizzoni, who took the helm at Italy's biggest lender after the ousting of Alessandro Profumo in September. "I am concerned about the fact that if not politically properly addressed, it will continue to be in the market, generating volatility," Ghizzoni told reporters at a banking conference in Frankfurt. Asked whether Ireland should accept a bailout, Ghizzoni said: "(It) could be good to reach an agreement, but we have to respect the independence of Ireland." INVESTMENT BANK DRIVE Earlier, Ghizzoni reiterated UniCredit's commitment to its investment banking business, saying he plans to expand it further, hoping to benefit from an economic rebound. "My target for 2011 and in the medium term is to increase the weight of investment banking," Ghizzoni told Reuters on the sidelines of Euro Finance Week. "If you look forward from the crisis, it would be absolutely wrong to pay reduced attention to this business." He also dismissed rumors that UniCredit may shrink its German operations, which account for the lion's share of UniCredit's corporate and investment banking division. Ghizzoni again denied Chairman Dieter Rampl would resign. Rampl was a supporter of UniCredit's former investment banking head Sergio Ermotti, who left the bank after being passed over for the CEO job in a management reshuffle. "Rampl is not leaving at all. I am denying that 100 percent. There is no reason," Ghizzoni said, adding Rampl's mandate expires in April 2012. The bank was making progress in finding a successor for Ermotti and hoped to appoint a manager within the next couple of weeks, Ghizzoni said. And while he was concerned about the effect of the Irish debt crisis on markets, UniCredit was largely immune. "The exposure of the group is almost zero, negligible," he said. In summer, Unicredit had said it had an 80 million euro exposure to Ireland. (Writing by Alexander Smith. Editing by Jane Merriman)
