 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - New U.S. claims for jobless benefits barely rose last week and manufacturing activity in the country's Mid-Atlantic region touched a near one-year high in November, more proof the economy was regaining momentum. 

 The improving economic picture also was enhanced by another report on Thursday showing a gauge of future activity increased 0.5 percent in October. However, the data are not robust enough to deter the Federal Reserve from fully implementing its much criticized program to purchase $600 billion worth of government debt to push already low interest rates down to stimulate the economy. "This is still going to remain a half-speed recovery, but certainly the numbers were are seeing are a little on the encouraging side, suggesting that maybe we will see a little bit of acceleration going into the new year," said David Wyss, chief economist at Standard & Poor's in New York. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits climbed 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 439,000, the Labor Department. But the four-week average, considered a better measure of underlying labor market trends, fell to a fresh two-year low. Economists had forecast claims to rise to 440,000. PHILLY FED INDEX JUMPS In a separate report, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank said its business activity index soared to 22.5 this month -- the highest since December -- from 1.0 in October. The rise beat market expectations for 5.0. Any reading above zero indicates expansion in the region's manufacturing. The economic data boosted U.S. stocks, which were already trading higher as fears over Ireland's debt crisis faded on expectations the country would receive emergency funding from the European partners and the International Monetary Fund. Prices for safe-have U.S. government debt fell. The dollar rose against the yen, but fell against the euro. The weekly claims data covered the survey week for the government's employment report for November. Though claims have been too volatile to provide a good prediction of nonfarm payrolls, analysts expect payrolls to expand again in November. Payrolls data showed employers adding jobs last month for the first time since May. The anemic labor market was a key factor in the Federal Reserve's controversial November 3 decision to pump more money into the economy to spur the recovery. The Philadelphia Fed survey also showed the employment index at highest since August 2007. The claims data showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid fell 48,000 to 4.3 million in the week ended November 6, in line with expectations and the lowest since November 2008. The number of people on emergency unemployment benefits rose 66,767 to 3.97 million in the week ended October 30. A total of 8.85 million people were claiming unemployment benefits during that period under all programs. Jobless benefits for 800,000 people will expire on November 30 unless Congress renews them. In total, two million unemployed people would lose benefits by the end of December. The benefits have been renewed several times as the country struggles with a 9.6 percent unemployment rate.
