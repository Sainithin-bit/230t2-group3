 HANOVER, Germany  (Reuters) - The example of Portugal shows that the euro zone's economic adjustment programs are working as the Southern European country will swing to a primary surplus in 2013, Germany's Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said on Monday. 
 Schaeuble added that Greece, where the economic reform program attached to its double-bailout has stalled, should not be the only measure of performance for the currency union's ability to fight its sovereign debt crisis. (Reporting by Andreas Rinke, writing by Annika Breidthardt)
