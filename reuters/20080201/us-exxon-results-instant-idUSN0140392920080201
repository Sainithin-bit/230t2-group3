 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp ( XOM.N ) said on Friday record oil prices boosted its fourth-quarter earnings to $11.66 billion, the highest ever operating profit by a U.S. company. 

 The stock rose nearly 2 percent on the news in pre-market trade.  COMMENTS: JAMES HALLORAN, PORTFOLIO MANAGER AT NATIONAL CITY PRIVATE CLIENT GROUP "Their foreign operations did extremely well. That's where they beat the street, for the lion's share." "Their return on capital employed is better than the others (oil companies) ... this is a  good report. They performed across the board: upstream, downstream, U.S. and foreign." "U.S. downstream was a little bit higher than what we had expected." (Reporting by  Matt Daily )
