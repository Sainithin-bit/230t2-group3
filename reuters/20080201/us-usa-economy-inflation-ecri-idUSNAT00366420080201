 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. inflation pressures edged up in January as inflationary moves in commodity price and interest rate measures were partly offset by a disinflationary move in a measure of loans, a report said on Friday. 

 The Economic Cycle Research Institute's U.S. Future Inflation Gauge (USFIG), designed to anticipate cyclical swings in the rate of inflation, rose to 117.9 from December's 117.4, revised upward from 117.1. "Despite the slight uptick, the USFIG remains close to December's 31-month low, suggesting that U.S. inflation pressures are still subdued," said Lakshman Achuthan, managing director at ECRI. The gauge's annualized growth rate, which smooths out monthly fluctuations, rose to minus 3.0 percent from minus 4.4 in December, revised from negative 4.6.
