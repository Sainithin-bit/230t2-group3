 SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - Societe Generale is sticking to its plan to hire two more traders for its Asia energy and commodities business even as the firm reels from a $7.3 billion loss it blames on a rogue trader, a senior official said on Friday. 

 The French firm will work to expand its niche as one of the few banks combining trade and project finance with hedging, Marc Lansonneur, SocGen's head of commodities derivatives in Asia, told Reuters in an interview. Societe Generale employs 10 traders and 10 marketers in Singapore and Australia, and has more than doubled its business volume from 2006 to last year after shifting its focus from the traditional flow business -- where banks hedge directly for customers -- after margins became increasingly thin. "What we needed were strategic deals. Combining financing and hedging always yielded better profitability," he said. It now derives 60 percent of its business from client servicing and the remaining 40 percent from its own proprietary trading. SocGen is still a small player in the competitive investment bank trading environment, where kingpins Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are being actively pursued by the likes of Barclays Capital and Lehman Bros. OVERCROWDED Lansonneur said when SocGen came to Asia in 1999, there were three or four banks offering direct hedging services -- known as the flow business -- for clients such as producers and end users, but now there are more than 10 offering a variety of services. "In Europe and the U.S., utility companies are among the most active customers. But it's not the case in Asia as most utilities are public companies and they are not in a position where they need to hedge," he said. "But I am positive that things will change and the markets will be deregulated such as in South Korea and Japan. I don't know how long it is going to take and in the meantime, we have to make money. That's why we need a sound business model." Its niche, he said, is in being able to provide financing services -- from trade- to project-financing -- incorporated with hedging services for customers in the energy and commodity sectors including physical traders, oil refiners, mine owners and shipping companies. For example, physical traders opt for short-term, one-year trade financing that includes hedging for their cargoes while others such as refiners who upgrade their plants prefer longer-term project financing embedded with hedging, he added. Lansonneur said the $7.3 billion trading loss that SocGen blames on Jerome Kerviel will not change its focus. "It is not an issue of the financial strength of SocGen. It is one individual who made rogue decisions. Our business model in Singapore will not change and we have the same ambition and strategy as we did before the event," Lansonneur told Reuters. "Our staff, clients and shareholders are convinced that it is a good business model and our clients trust us." SocGen's shares rose as high as 4.5 percent on Friday, after a report that fellow French bank Credit Agricole had hired advisers to study a possible approach, while the country's biggest listed bank, BNP Paribas, confirmed on Thursday it would look at making an offer. SocGen has said it is determined to stay independent, and a source familiar with the matter said on Friday it was studying how it could avoid a low-priced takeover. (Editing by Ramthan Hussain)
