 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. factory activity rose into expansion territory in January after contracting in December to the weakest since April 2003, according to an industry report released on Friday. 

 U.S. consumer sentiment rose less than expected in January from December, although worries persisted over sharp declines in the stock market and the housing slump, a survey released on Friday showed.  KEY POINTS: * The Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity rose to 50.7 in January from 48.4 in December. * The ISM reading was above economists' median forecast for a reading of 47.3. A reading above 50 indicates expansion. * The Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers said its final January figure on consumer sentiment was 78.4, above December's final reading of 75.5. * Reuters/University of Michigan was down from preliminary January estimates of 80.5 and slightly below the median forecast of 79.0 in a Reuters poll.  COMMENTS:  DENNIS SADLOWSKI, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, SIEMENS ENERGY & AUTOMATION INC, ALPHARETTA, GEORGIA: "It doesn't surprise us much at all (that ISM showed manufacturing growth). With the most recent headlines indicating a steep downturn and everyone using the 'r' word a little more loosely, we have been talking to our customers and -- not withstanding a significant shift -- they are still pretty optimistic. This month's numbers don't surprise us much. "We see a slower growth outlook with our indicators, but it is still a growth outlook."  WILLIAM SULLIVAN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, JVB FINANCIAL GROUP, BOCA RATON, FLORIDA: "The ISM report shows some sign of stability in the manufacturing sector as 2008 got under way. "However, this bounce back in manufacturing activity that the ISM suggests still doesn't produce one new job in the economy. "The recession risks are building and the jobs data are consistent with a recession beginning in January. "The Treasury market is obviously reacting to what is taking place in the equity arena."  NORBERT ORE, CHAIR OF THE ISM MANUFACTURING BUSINESS SURVEY COMMITTEE, ATLANTA, GEORGIA: "We've got a number of dynamics working and some of them seem to be working in favor of the manufacturing sector. The overall index came in at 50.7 indicating slight growth in manufacturing, as opposed to last month which I thought was an off-trend decline. The January reading appears to be much more on trend. "If you look at the last 12 months, the ISM manufacturing index has averaged 51.2 with only a 5 point spread between a low of 48.4 and a high of 53.4. It's rare that we have such a tight band of growth and contraction within manufacturing. What that really says is that for the past 12 months, manufacturing has been going sideways; there has been growth, marginal growth, but manufacturing seems to be holding up quite well all things considered about what's going on in other parts of the economy."  CARL LANTZ, U.S. INTEREST RATE STRATEGIST, CREDIT SUISSE, NEW YORK: "The data is kind of mixed. Obviously payrolls were very weak. ISM was okay. The internals are weaker though. New orders were down and employment was down. So the two probably most important things in there were actually lower. So it's a little weaker than the headline would suggest. We also just got final consumer confidence data which was a little weaker than expected. "On balance I think everything is consistent with a slowing economy. Right now you've got weakish data but then you've also got equities doing well. "In the bond market, it's kind of two-way today. I think on balance it is constructive for the bond market going forward, probably with a steepening bias. Prices paid was very high in  ISM. "The GDP outlook isn't very good for the first quarter as we start off. As we go forward there should be more steepening and the front end of the bond market should do relatively well. For the balance of the day it is all going to be about stocks, whether they can hold onto their gains. I think a lot of technicians want them to have a decent close on the week. If stocks can't do well with 125 basis points of Federal Reserve rate cuts then it gets kind of worrying."  KEITH HEMBRE, CHIEF ECONOMIST, FAF ADVISORS, MINNEAPOLIS: ISM: "It's mainly the production index being higher, not new orders. My sense is that production cranked up due to a drawdown in inventory. This is just a temporary uptick and it will turn back down in the coming months. There is no meaningful change in demand. "A rise in inventory is a good sign if demand is increasing. Right now, it (demand) is still in contraction territory so a rise in inventory is a forecast of lower production in the future." REUTERS/U. MICHIGAN SURVEYS OF CONSUMERS: "Their assets are depreciating in value whether it's financial or real estate. Income is weakening. Credit and jobs are harder to come by. It's a recipe for an unhappy consumer sector, and the survey is showing that."  ERIC KUBY, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, NORTHSTAR INVESTMENT  MANAGEMENT CORP., CHICAGO: "To a certain extent the market has or had priced in a recession. So I think the economic data that's coming out is sort of in a range of what's expected not worse than expected."  IAN SHEPHERDSON, CHIEF U.S. ECONOMIST, HIGH FREQUENCY  ECONOMICS, VALHALLA, NEW YORK: ISM: "After the horrible Philly Fed survey and the drop in the Chicago PMI this is something of a relief, though we very much doubt it means the ISM has bottomed out. The rise in the headline index reflects gains in new orders, production and inventories. Employment dipped a bit, though, to its lowest since September 2003. "Overall the survey is now in line with our model, based on year-ago movements in corporate bond yields, but we remain nervous that the tightening in credit conditions and the clear slowing in consumption will shortly feed into weaker activity."  SHAUN OSBORNE, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST, TD SECURITIES,  TORONTO: ISM: "This data really is making for some very choppy trading. The ISM in particular muddies the outlook even more. I think the key issue is to what extent these numbers suggest the Fed has more or less to do. Overall, given that it all simply promotes uncertainty, we are likely to see a little more pressure on high-risk trades. The dollar probably doesn't do that badly if that's the case. It will stay under pressure against the yen and Swiss franc, but it's a bifurcated outlook. As we've seen, the euro has really struggled to hold gains above $1.49. Today was the sixth time since November it pushed up there and then fell, so for now, the euro isn't looking like it will break $1.50."  STUART HOFFMAN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES, PITTSBURGH: ISM: "It is back above break even territory for manufacturing. It's contrary to the idea that the economy is falling into recession. It's hanging by a thread but it hasn't been cut yet. "We are having a lot of mixed signals. You are not getting a smoking gun that screams recession. The economy is very weak. It's on the edge of recession but the data are mixed enough so that you can't say a recession has begun." CONSTRUCTION SPENDING: "Fundamentally, construction is clearly weak in housing. Housing is going to remain a huge drag on the economy. It's going to keep going for the months and quarters to come."  MATTHEW STRAUSS, CURRENCY STRATEGIST AT RBC CAPITAL IN TORONTO: ISM: "It's a bit of a relief to see ISM index coming back above the important mark of 50. The report's price component also shows a decent jump and that indicates there's still some price power in the U.S. manufacturing sector. All in all, it's a supportive report for both stocks and the dollar after the weak payrolls reading earlier this morning."  MARKET REACTION: - BONDS: U.S. Treasuries pare gains after ISM data. - CURRENCIES: The dollar edges higher against the euro, yen after ISM report. - US STOCKS: U.S. stocks indexes add to gains after ISM data. - RATE FUTURES: U.S. short-term interest rate futures pared earlier gains on Friday when a key measure of U.S. factory activity was reported stronger than expected in January.
