 (Reuters) - Aluminum Corp of China (Chinalco), the world's third-biggest alumina producer, has teamed up with U.S. Alcoa ( AA.N ) to buy a 12 percent stake in Rio Tinto ( RIO.L ) for $14 billion, giving it access to raw materials and threatening to thwart a potential bid by BHP Billiton ( BLT.L ). 

 (For story, click on <ID:nL01435125> Formed seven years ago when Beijing split up the state-owned CNNC that had managed all base metals operations, Chalco produced over 12 percent of the world's alumina and nearly a tenth of its aluminum last year, feeding China's booming manufacturers of everything from airplanes to cars to soda cans. Chinalco is following in the footsteps of China's big oil companies who have spent several years buying into overseas fields to ensure a secure supply of raw materials to fuel the world's fourth-largest economy. It has been on the acquisition trail for the past year, buying producer Peru Copper Inc PCR.TO for about $800 million last June and has moved forward on a $2.5 billion bauxite development in Australia and an aluminum smelter in Saudi Arabia. On the domestic front, it has received government approval to expand investment on copper, and has recently set up a joint venture with three other firms to build commercial jets. Its revenues reached 131.7 billion yuan ($18.3 billion) in 2007, up 24.1 percent on the year, with profits over 20 billion yuan. Its assets are worth 201.4 billion yuan. Chinalco's listed arm Chalco ( 2600.HK ) ( 601600.SS ), which runs its premium alumina and aluminum plants in China, has a market capitalization of US$50 billion. Last September Alcoa sold its stake in Chalco ( 2600.HK ) unit for $2.0 billion -- a $1.8 billion profit on an investment it had taken in Chalco's 2001 IPO. The two firms are still have a pending plan to set up a 50:50 joint venture to run the Chinese firm's Pingguo plant, which has 940,000 tonnes of alumina and 135,000 tonnes of aluminum capacity. It is building another 880,000 tonne alumina facility and seeking approval to build another 250,000 tonne smelter. In 2007, Chinalco produced 10.46 million tonnes of alumina, 3.56 million tonnes of aluminum ingots and 798,000 tonnes of aluminum products. As of end-2007, Chinalco controlled 12 million tonnes of copper resources. Following is a list of assets in which Chinalco fully or partly controls.
