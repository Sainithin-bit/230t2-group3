 STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - Telecom equipment maker Ericsson ( ERICb.ST ) reported lower-than-expected profit and announced sweeping job cuts on Friday as the group hunkered down for what it expects will be a flat market this year. 

 The world's biggest mobile network maker said it would chop about 4 billion Swedish crowns ($630.3 million) per year from costs to adapt to what it saw as little or no growth in the mobile infrastructure market this year. "We have steadily improved our leading position and market share in an increasingly challenging market," Ericsson Chief Executive Carl-Henric Svanberg said in a statement. "The market growth however slowed during last year and for 2008 we find it prudent to plan for a flattish mobile infrastructure market." Ericsson shares recovered from initial losses to stand 0.5 percent higher at 14.37 crowns by 0854 GMT, underperforming a 1.5 percent gain in the broader market  .OMXS30 . The Swedish firm, which shed thousands of jobs and recorded huge losses as the IT bubble burst early this decade, said it planned to cut about 1,000 jobs in its home market and Svanberg told local agency TT some 4,000 jobs would go globally. It said the full effect of the savings would come in 2009. As of December, Ericsson had 74,000 employees, just under 20,000 of whom were employed at its operations in Sweden. Ericsson, whose shares have lost nearly half their value since issuing a profit warning in mid-October, said its operating earnings slid to 7.6 billion Swedish crowns ($1.2 billion) in the fourth quarter from 12.2 billion a year earlier. Forecasts in a Reuters poll were for a 7.94 billion crown profit. MULTIMEDIA WEAKNESS The firm said its operating margin fell to 14.0 percent, below forecasts for 14.7 percent and well short of the 22.5 percent reported a year earlier. The erosion of earnings in recent quarters has been mainly due to the firm making less money from higher-margin network upgrades and more from the less profitable network rollouts. But analysts, who said a downbeat report from Ericsson had been expected, noted the firm's networks business hade performed in line or slightly stronger than expected and instead zeroed in on one particular area where Ericsson looked unexpectedly soft -- the company's multimedia division. "In the P&L there's one weak spot and that's the multimedia division with much bigger losses than the consensus was looking for," said Thomas Langer, analyst at WestLB. "Everybody was looking for a small operating profit." Multimedia, a division created as part of a reorganization designed to ensure future long-term growth, lost 439 million crowns in the quarter versus a year-ago profit of 527 million. Multimedia sales totaled 4.9 billion crowns, compared with an average forecast for 5.12 billion in a Reuters survey. "That's the only thing that somewhat spoiled the P&L. All the core businesses performed in line and maybe networks was a bit better than expected, especially on the top line. On the positive side I would highlight the operating cash flow which was much stronger than we expected," said WestLB's Langer. Overall, sales of 54.5 million crowns were slightly better than forecasts of 53.8 billion. Ericsson had announced in October it saw sales in a 53 billion to 60 billion range, but later said it saw them coming in at the lower end of that range. Greger Johansson, analyst at Redeye, said a cost cutting plan had been expected by the market. "I had expected it to be slightly bigger. The other important issue is that they've cut their global outlook to no growth at all," he said.
