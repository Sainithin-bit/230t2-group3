 STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - Ericsson ( ERICb.ST ) Chief Executive Carl-Henric Svanberg said on Friday the Swedish firm would eye any assets put up for sale by U.S. rival Motorola Inc MOT.N, but would be "very cautious" about any deal. 

 "As professional business leaders we look at everything, but we would take a very cautious view on such a thing because we do believe you are better off doing it on your own," Svanberg told an analysts' conference. "We are probably the company of all our competitors that has acquired the least because we do base our strategy on our own internal work -- R&D and organic growth." Motorola said on Thursday it was considering separating its loss-making mobile phone unit in what it called a "structural and strategic realignment". (Reporting by Stockholm Newsroom)
