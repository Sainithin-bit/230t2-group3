 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Boeing ( BA.N ) on Friday announced major personnel changes in its defense sector, shifting 14 executives to new jobs but keeping Jim Albaugh as chief executive and president. 

 Boeing said executives in each of the company's three major defense areas would have new assignments, including John Lockard, who previously headed precision engagement and mobility systems and will now become chief operating officer, reporting to Albaugh. The moves take effect on Monday. Boeing said in a statement that the changes would build on the continued strong performance of the company's defense, intelligence and space businesses. Albaugh, president and chief executive of Boeing Integrated Defense Systems, said the changes would position the $32 billion Boeing unit for continued success. Two of the executives being replaced in the Boeing defense operations, John Van Gels and Howard Chambers, recently began special assignments on the 787 program, Boeing said. Among the changes, Dennis Muilenburg, who previously led the U.S. Army's Future Combat Systems modernization effort, becomes president of support systems.
