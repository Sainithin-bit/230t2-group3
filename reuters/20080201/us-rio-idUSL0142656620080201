 LONDON  (Reuters) - Chinese mining group Chinalco said on Friday it had teamed up with U.S. aluminum producer Alcoa ( AA.N ) to buy a 12 percent in Rio Tinto ( RIO.L ). 

 The move comes days ahead of a deadline for BHP Billiton ( BLT.L ), the world's biggest miner, to make a firm offer for Rio Tinto or to drop its proposed takeover, which has so far been resisted by Rio.   Following are views on the acquisition: JAMES WILSON, DJ CARMICHAEL & CO ANALYST "Everyone has been so preoccupied with the BHP assault, that only BHP had the muscle to take on Rio, that the idea of other buyers coming in was never really addressed. On its own, 12 percent may not be enough to block BHP if it really wants to go after Rio, but it certainly can throw a wrench into its plans." GEOFFREY CHENG, ANALYST AT DAIWA INSTITUTE OF RESEARCH "This will immediately block BHP Billiton's offer for Rio Tinto since Chalco has already said that a merger of the two would pose a threat to the market. "Chalco shares jumped on hopes that it may benefit from the deal, such as getting the Rio Tinto stake from its parent. But I believe this is just wishful thinking since Rio Tinto also has a lot of non-aluminum assets." MICHAEL RAWLINSON, LIBERUM CAPITAL "The door is still very much open for BHP. 12 percent is not a blocking stake ... and 60 pounds a share is equivalent to about 4-to-1 (BHP shares for each Rio share) and we think BHP can go up to about 4.5-to-1." TOM GIDLEY-KITCHIN, CHARLES STANLEY ANALYST "I do believe that BHP is going to make a formal offer next week ... and I would assume it'll be probably be raised. "The Chinese are trying to stop the deal go through. I'm sure that's the reasoning behind this. It may make the probability of BHP providing a cash alternative or cash component more probable. It certainly puts some pressure on  BHP." (Editing by David Holmes/Quentin Bryar)
