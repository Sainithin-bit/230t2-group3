 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp on Friday offered to buy Yahoo Inc for about $44.6 billion in cash and stock, seeking to join forces against Google Inc in what would be the biggest Internet deal since the Time Warner Inc merger with AOL. 

 The proposed deal, which would marry the world's biggest software maker with one of the leading Internet media companies, would shake up the market for online services such as email and advertising. The following are comparative statistics for the most popular sites on the Internet.
