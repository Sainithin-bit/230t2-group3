 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. consumer sentiment rose less than expected in January from December, although worries persisted over sharp declines in the stock market and the housing slump, a survey released on Friday showed. 

 The Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers said its final January figure on consumer sentiment was 78.4, above December's final reading of 75.5. However, it was down from preliminary January estimates of 80.5 and slightly below the median forecast of 79.0 in a Reuters poll. (Reporting by  Lucia Mutikani ; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
