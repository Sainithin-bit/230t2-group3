 PHILADELPHIA  (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's $44.6 billion bid to acquire Yahoo Inc marked a coup for the companies' advisers and gave a surprise boost to Blackstone Group and Lehman Brothers in the closely watched rankings of financial advisers. 

 Landing such a large deal is a plum assignment for bankers, who earn large fees from advising on mergers and acquisitions. Microsoft hired Morgan Stanley and Blackstone Group, while Yahoo hired Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers, according to research firm Dealogic. It was unclear if the companies had hired additional advisers. Microsoft and Yahoo, as well as the advisers, declined to comment. Historically, advisers get paid between 2 percent and 4 percent of the value of the deal. At that rate, advisers could share between $892 million and $1.78 billion. While Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley often compete for the top spot among global merger advisers, the Microsoft-Yahoo bid shuffled the "league table" rankings. Goldman held on to its No. 1 ranking, but Lehman toppled Morgan Stanley from its No. 2 position. Lehman, which ranked ninth globally in 2007, now stands in the No. 2 spot and Morgan Stanley sits at No. 3, according to Dealogic. Meanwhile, Blackstone, which failed to make the rankings of the Top 20 global advisers last year, surged to fourth place, Dealogic said. So far this year Blackstone has advised on only three deals, but the three have a combined value of $49.9 billion, Dealogic said. The banking team from Morgan Stanley's side is made up of Paul Taubman, Chuck Cory, Drew Guevara and Thomas Whayne, one source said.
