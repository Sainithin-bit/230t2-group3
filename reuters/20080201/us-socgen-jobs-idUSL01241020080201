 LONDON  (Reuters) - Banks are circling star traders and bankers at Societe Generale ( SOGN.PA ), the French bank hit by a rogue trader scandal. 

 "Whenever the City smells blood, they let loose their piranhas to feed," said Shaun Springer, chief executive of recruitment firm Napier Scott. "The fact that there are issues around (SocGen), clearly people will be taking advantage." One search firm said on Friday it had received approaches from several banks looking to hire from SocGen, particularly from its cash equities and derivatives businesses. SocGen, which has become a global leader in financial derivatives trading, is seen as a bid target after disclosing last week that unauthorized trading by an employee had led to 4.9 billion euros ($7.3 billion) of losses. "I wouldn't be surprised if banks exploited this situation, cherry picking the best people at Societe Generale," said a London-based headhunter who declined to be named. "Those houses that want to bolster their structured finance and equity derivatives businesses may look to poach staff from Societe Generale." Graham Shore, a managing director of boutique investment bank Shore Capital, said it was reasonable to expect staff to leave SocGen: "You can't imagine it's a very happy ship." But the bank is not likely to see a big drain from its 120,000-strong workforce when many firms are cutting rather than adding jobs, recruiters and analysts say. "I don't think anybody wants to hunt for a new job right now," said an analyst at a major U.S. investment bank. "Secondly, people are tied down in France," she added, explaining that most employees in France would have to give six months' notice before leaving. The London-based headhunter said: "It's a very strong culture and a very loyal culture. A lot of people have a lot of confidence in the board's and senior management's ability to ride out the storm." But for some SocGen employees, it may be wise to leave the bank before they are told to. "There is a likelihood that BNP Paribas ( BNPP.PA ) takes them over and then there will be major job losses," the analyst at the U.S. investment bank said. She added many jobs would be cut because of an overlap between the businesses and clients of SocGen and those of its French rival. SocGen did not respond to Reuters queries about how they were planning to prevent possible staff departures. (Editing by Sue Thomas)
