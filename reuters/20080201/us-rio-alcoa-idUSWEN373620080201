 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Aluminum producer Alcoa Inc ( AA.N ) said on Friday it will contribute up to $1.2 billion in its partnership with China's Chinalco to acquire a 12 percent stake in mining giant Rio Tinto Plc ( RIO.L ). 

 "We have long believed that Rio Tinto has a world-class portfolio of assets and is very well positioned to prosper in the current mining cycle," said Alain Belda, Alcoa's chairman and chief executive. "This investment, made in partnership with Chinalco, allows us to mutually benefit from developments in the sector." The deal sent Alcoa's stock up 1.8 percent to $33.68 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Earlier Friday, in Beijing, Chinalco said it had teamed up with Alcoa to buy a $14 billion stake in Rio Tinto, and said it may make a bid, threatening miner BHP Billiton Plc's ( BLT.L ) efforts to win Rio.
