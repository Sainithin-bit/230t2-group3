 STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - Telecom equipment maker Ericsson 
( ERICb.ST ) reported on Friday lower-than-expected operating 
profit of 7.6 billion Swedish crowns ($1.20 billion) in the 
fourth quarter and announced major cost cuts. 

  Ericsson, the world's biggest mobile network maker, said it 
was planning for "flattish" development in the mobile 
infrastructure market in 2008 and it will cut costs by about 4 
billion crowns per year, with the full effect coming in 2009.  It is cutting about 1,000 jobs in Sweden.  Earnings before income and tax compared with 5.6 billion 
crowns in the third quarter and 12.2 billion crowns in the 
year-earlier period. Forecasts were for a 7.94 billion crown 
fourth-quarter profit.  The company said it had a 14 percent operating margin, 
below forecasts for 14.7 percent.
