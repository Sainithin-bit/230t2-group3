 LONDON  (Reuters) - Surprisingly poor U.S. jobs data trimmed equity gains on Friday and weakened the dollar but stock market sentiment remain strong after Microsoft ( MSFT.O ) said it was buying Yahoo <YHOO.O). 

 The non-farm payrolls release showed the U.S. economy lost 17,000 jobs in January, compared with a median expectation of 80,000 new U.S. jobs predicted by economists polled by Reuters. Wall Street futures pointed to a modest start, far less bullish than before the data. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index  .FTEU3  was up 1.6 percent, down from more than 2 percent earlier. Equities were being supported by major corporate announcements. Software giant Microsoft Corp said it had offered to acquire internet media company Yahoo Inc in a proposed cash and stock deal valued at $44.6 billion. Chinese aluminium company Chinalco had early announced it had bought a 12 percent stake in miner Rio Tinto ( RIO.L ) jointly with U.S. producer Alcoa ( AA.N ). (Reporting by  Jeremy Gaunt )
