 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - China's $14 billion investment in Rio Tinto ( RIO.L )( RIO.AX ) marks its coming of age in the global market, fulfilling years of promise that the commodities titan would one day make it onto the world stage. 

 With about $1.4 trillion in reserves and an appetite for metals that has made it the motor of the world commodity markets, China has both motive and opportunity for major acquisitions. Bankers say state-owned companies such as Chinalco, which said on Friday it had teamed up with U.S. aluminum producer Alcoa to buy 12 percent of Rio, examine every morsel on the market but had not taken a big bite. Until now. "This has happened fast and it will send shockwaves through the mining industry around the world. This shows China is going to accelerate its pace," said Feng Zhang, vice-president of China metals and mining at JP Morgan equity research. "Previously people didn't believe such a thing could happen but it has. It's also a surprise for us, because generally we thought Chinese companies were not ready for such a large deal." Funding for the deal came from China Development Bank (CDB), which last July made a 2.2 billion euro investment in Britain's Barclays Plc ( BARC.L ). CDB is one of China's three "policy banks", so named because their job is to support state policy, giving them deep pockets and a direct line to the very top. In December, the government injected $20 billion into CDB, part of a plan to slowly turn it into a commercial lender. Investment bankers say the template for major acquisitions involves the state funding a state-owned enterprise such as Chinalco, which can buy assets without recourse to shareholders and then inject them into a listed subsidiary at its own pace. That allows the listed company, in this case Chalco ( 2600.HK ) ( 601600.SS ), to punch above its weight. Its market value has halved to $46 billion in the last three months, but even at its peak it might have found Rio too big for it to swallow alone. BRAINS BEHIND THE DEAL One source with knowledge of the Chinese side of the deal said the Chinese financial muscle was not the driver of the deal but the enabler, and in fact Alcoa Inc, which put up $1.2 billion, was the brains behind it. "Alcoa approached Chalco about two weeks ago," he said. "The Chinese were looking at getting into a consortium and were scratching their heads about how difficult it would be. Because it's China, people think it's China leading it, but in fact it's Alcoa leading it." The deal suits Chinalco, not only because it drives a wedge between Rio and its putative acquirer, BHP Billiton BTL.L( BHP.AX ). BHP will now face a much tougher fight for Rio. If it succeeded, it would control much of the iron ore sector, a scenario Chinese steelmakers were rumored to dread. The tie-up with Rio also ticks several strategy boxes at Chinalco, which wants to diversify into copper and other metals. Last September Chinalco told the China Daily newspaper that copper, which accounted for less than 10 percent of its income, could become a major revenue earner. In a statement on Friday, Chinalco described the Rio deal as "a strategic stake for Chinalco to become a multinational and multi-metals company". Investment bankers say Chinese executives often see bids in terms of its potential for providing China with physical commodities, rather than just profit from their sale on the international market. China's seeming inability to do a major merger or acquisition for so long was often blamed on the skeleton in its cupboard - a bid for U.S. oil firm Unocal in 2005 that was stymied by strong political opposition in Washington. By teaming up with U.S. rival Alcoa, China may have banished that demon forever. (Additional reporting by  Lucy Hornby ; editing by Sue Thomas)
