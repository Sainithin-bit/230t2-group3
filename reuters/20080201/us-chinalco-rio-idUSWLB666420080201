 LONDON  (Reuters) - Chinese mining group Chinalco said on Friday it had teamed up with U.S. aluminum producer Alcoa ( AA.N ) to buy a 12 percent in Rio Tinto ( RIO.L ). 

 The move comes days ahead of a deadline for BHP Billiton ( BLT.L ), the world's biggest miner, to make a firm offer for Rio Tinto or to drop its proposed takeover, which has so far been resisted by Rio. Chinalco and Alcoa said they did not currently intend to make an offer for Rio, but reserved the right to do so if Rio received a firm bid from a third party.
