 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Beazer Homes USA Inc ( BZH.N ) said on Friday it would cease some operations, including mortgage origination, causing unspecified charges. 

 The company said besides mortgage origination, it would exit some homebuilding operations in North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina and Kentucky. Beazer also said it would enter a new marketing services deal with mortgage lender Countrywide Financial Corp CFC.N. As a result of the changes, Beazer's first-quarter financial results will include charges, though it said it is unable to quantify the amount of the charges at this time.
