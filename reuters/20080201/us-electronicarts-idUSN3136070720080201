 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Top video game publisher Electronic Arts Inc ERTS.O lowered its profit forecast on Thursday as it delayed "Mercenaries 2" and a new "Battlefield" title, sending its shares down 6 percent. 

 Electronic Arts also expects to ship its highly anticipated game "Spore" before the holidays, later than the April-June time frame expected by many in the industry. EA said it expected fiscal fourth-quarter results to range from a loss of 3 cents per share to a profit of 2 cents per share, excluding special items -- well below the 17 cents that was the average analyst forecast on Reuters Estimates. It also changed its projected full-year profit range to between 93 cents and 98 cents from 85 cents to $1.15. Despite delaying "Battlefield: Bad Company" and "Mercenaries 2" to fiscal 2009, which begins April 1, EA kept its quarterly revenue estimates in line with Wall Street targets due to strong sales of hit musical game "Rock Band." EA distributes "Rock Band" for Viacom Inc's VIAb.N MTV Games. While it books all sales from that game, which costs at least $170, less of that falls to its own bottom line compared with titles EA publishes itself. "We are shipping out high-margin properties to next year and getting more on the top line from 'Rock Band'," EA Chief Financial Officer Warren Jenson told Reuters. That did not explain all of the shortfall in the company's outlook, according to Wedbush Morgan analyst Michael Pachter, who said EA's expenses were likely higher than expected. "They have historically made money at the $600 million revenue level. For them to break even on $800 million has people spooked," Pachter said, referring to EA's fourth-quarter revenue forecast. EA shares fell as much as 6 percent to $44.50 in extended Nasdaq trading. Based on Thursday's close, the stock has fallen more than 6 percent over the past year, compared with a rise of more than 50 percent for chief rival Activision Inc ( ATVI.O ). EA posted a 44 percent rise in adjusted profit for its third quarter, but said it lost three points of market share in North America and Europe due to a lack of must-have titles. "We are not satisfied where we are. We had no internally developed breakaway titles," Chief Executive John Riccitiello told analysts on a conference call. One potential breakaway game is "Spore," in which players nurture microbes into a galaxy-spanning civilization. The game is made by Will Wright, the legendary game designer behind hits such as "The Sims." Asked about when "Spore" would be released, Riccitiello said: "It's going to be before the holidays," an apparent delay from an earlier guidance that pointed to a spring debut. EA said last May it could delay "Spore" to its fiscal 2009 year, leading many analysts to expect "Spore" to arrive in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, which begins in April. For its fiscal third quarter, Electronic Arts said profit excluding special items was $290 million, or 90 cents per share, compared with $201 million, or 63 cents per share, a year earlier, and one penny higher than the average Wall Street estimate. Third-quarter net revenue was $1.5 billion, up 17 percent from a year ago, boosted by sales of titles such as "Need for Speed: Pro Street" and "FIFA 08."
