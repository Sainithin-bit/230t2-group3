 LONDON  (Reuters) - A bullish view of the metals cycle was a driving factor behind Aluminum Corp of China's (Chinalco) move to team up with U.S. Alcoa ( AA.N ) to buy a stake in mining group Rio Tinto ( RIO.L ), the head of Chinalco said on Friday. 

 "We made this investment primarily because of... our strong belief in the sustained strength of the commodity cycle," Chinalco President Xiao Yaqing told a news conference in London. "We have a very bullish view on the long-term prospects of the global mining sector," he added. Chinalco announced on Friday it had teamed up with Alcoa to buy a $14 billion stake in Rio Tinto, accounting for 9 percent of Rio's total shares listed in the UK and Australia. The move by state-owned Chinalco is the China's biggest ever investment overseas, with Alcoa spending only $1.2 billion for its participation. The move comes days before a regulatory deadline on Wednesday for BHP Billiton ( BLT.L ) to make a firm offer for Rio ( RIO.AX ) or walk away, but Xiao said Chinalco's motive was to diversify into an international metals and mining group. Chinese steel companies have opposed BHP's plans to acquire Rio since a marriage of the two firms would create a massive controlling force across a range of commodities such as iron ore and coal. But Xiao said concern for China's role as a huge consumer of commodities was not a major impetus for his firm's move, rather it was the group's long-term view of the commodities sector within an increasingly globalize economy. "While China is the major source of demand for various metals currently, we did not base our decision for this investment purely on considerations for China," Xiao said. "We do see cycles -- ups and downs -- in the global mining sector in the short term, but we have a very long horizon in our investments," he said. "We believe that given... various factors that drive globalization... we will eventually become a unified, one economy, therefore it for is this long-term consideration that we have made this investment."
