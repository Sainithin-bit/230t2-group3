 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. construction spending fell a sharper-than-expected 1.1 percent in December, led by a decline in private home construction as the housing market continued its slide, government data on Friday showed. 

 December's decline to a $1.140 trillion seasonally adjusted annual rate, its lowest since $1.133 trillion in July 2005, came after a revised 0.4 percent decline in November that was first reported as a gain of 0.1 percent. Analysts polled by Reuters ahead of the report were expecting construction spending to fall 0.5 percent. For all of last year, construction spending was down a record 2.6 percent from the year before for a total of $1.161 trillion. Spending on private home projects fell 2.8 percent in December to a $462.0 billion rate, the 22nd consecutive monthly decrease since a peak in February 2006. Total private construction was off 1 percent while public construction was down 1.5 percent. The only major sector to increase was private nonresidential construction, rising by 1.3 percent. Federal construction was down 1.3 percent to $20.4 billion, while state and local construction was off 1.5 percent to $277 billion. (Reporting by Patrick Rucker; Editing by  Chizu Nomiyama )
