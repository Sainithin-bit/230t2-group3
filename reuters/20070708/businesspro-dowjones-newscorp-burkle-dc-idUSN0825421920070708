 PHILADELPHIA  (Reuters) - Dow Jones & Co. DJ.N, which has 
been in talks on a takeover by News Corp. NWSa.N, will meet 
with supermarket magnate Ron Burkle as Dow Jones explores its 
options, according to a report in the online edition of the 
Wall Street Journal. 

  Dow Jones is making a last push to try to find other 
potential buyers, in part, to appease Leslie Hill, a Dow Jones 
director and a member of the Bancroft family, the newspaper 
said. The Bancroft family controls 64 percent of the company's 
votes.  Burkle has been exploring a structure for Dow Jones that 
would incorporate an employee stock ownership plan, the report 
said. A committee of Dow Jones's board is expected to meet with 
Burkle on Monday, the report said.  Dow Jones and News Corp. continue to negotiate a potential 
deal, with an agreement on price possible soon, the report 
said.  Dow Jones and Burkle were not immediately available to 
comment.
