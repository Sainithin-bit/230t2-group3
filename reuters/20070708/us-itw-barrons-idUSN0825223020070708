 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares in Illinois Tool Works Inc ( ITW.N ) could rise more than 20 percent in the next year on acquisitions and robust demand for infrastructure projects, Barron's reported in its July 9 issue. 

 The diversified manufacturer, which has bought about 32 companies a year over the past 10 years, could see its share price rise to $67 to $68, Barron's reported. Shares in Illinois Tool Works, which have risen about 21 percent so far this year, closed on Friday at $55.81. "It's exceptionally attractive," Barron's quotes Goldman Sachs analyst Deane Dray as saying. "It has had a nice pop, but has a lot more room to run." The stock, which has been trading at a discount to peers, could justifiably deserve a 10 percent premium, which would translate into a price-to-earnings multiple of 18 and a share price of $67, Dray adds. Daniel Dowd of Bernstein Research tells Barron's that Illinois Tool Works would enjoy a higher valuation if investors better understood its business model. "ITW's competitive advantage lies in its ability to create value through world-class capital allocation, and in identifying and systematically improving very small acquisitions," Dowd is quoted by Barron's as saying.
