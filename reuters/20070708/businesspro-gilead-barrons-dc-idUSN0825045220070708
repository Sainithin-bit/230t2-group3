 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares in biotechnology company Gilead 
Sciences Inc ( GILD.O ) could climb another 20 percent to 25 
percent on strong demand for its existing AIDS and flu drugs as 
well as from new products in the pipeline, Barron's reported in 
its July 9 issue. 

  Earnings could rise 25 percent this year to $1.50 to $1.55 
per share, Barron's reported citing Eun Yang of Jefferies.  "For the past 20 years, I have been asked every year if the 
growth now will slow," Barron's quotes Chief Executive John 
Martin as saying. "It hasn't and won't. I continue to see 
developing value for stockholders. I continue to see a very 
exciting future for this company."  Gilead, which could be a potential takeover target, is 
eyeing acquisition as well as stock buybacks, Barron's 
reported.  Gilead shares, which have risen about 20 percent so far 
this year, closed on Friday at $39.12.
