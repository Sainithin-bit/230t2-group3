 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares in SonoSite Inc. SONO.O, a maker of portable ultrasound medical equipment, could be headed lower because of the threat posed by rival General Electric Co. ( GE.N ), Barron's reported in its July 9 issue. 

 The shares, which closed on Friday at $36.13, could be headed to $30 as GE gains market share and amid a patent dispute, Barron's said in the article. "We believe our share of this market will grow rapidly," Barron's quotes Omar Ishrak, chief executive of GE's Healthcare Clinical Systems unit, as saying. In addition, SonoSite is embroiled in a patent dispute with GE that, if it loses, "could be crippling to SonoSite, considering the company's one-dimensional product line," Sean D. Lavin, an analyst with Oppenheimer & Co., told Barron's. SonoSite and GE are suing one another, both claiming the other infringed on patents. SonoSite said on Thursday its second-quarter revenue rose about 20 percent to more than $47 million on strong growth in its U.S. hospital business.
