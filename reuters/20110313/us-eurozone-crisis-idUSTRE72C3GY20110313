 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Euro zone leaders agreed on Friday a package of measures they hope will resolve the region's debt crisis. Euro zone finance ministers will work out technical details of the package on March 14-15, in time for formal adoption of all the measures by an EU summit on March 24-25. 

 Below are the measures that have been agreed and those that remain to be discussed. HIGHER EFFECTIVE LENDING CAPACITY OF THE EFSF Euro zone leaders agreed to increase the effective lending capacity of the European Financial Stability Facility, the euro zone's bailout fund, to the fund's nominal value of 440 billion euros from the current effective capacity of around 250 billion. The effective capacity is now lower than the nominal one because of the need to retain its triple-A credit rating by the EFSF. HOW WILL THE EFSF'S CAPACITY BE INCREASED? Euro zone finance ministers will tackle this on Monday. Raising the EFSF's capacity may require euro zone states to raise guarantees, forcing some governments to seek fresh approval from their parliaments, a problem in countries -- particularly Germany -- where public opinion is against bailouts. Chancellor Angela Merkel faces several tough regional elections in coming weeks. A euro zone source said on Saturday that all euro zone countries would increase guarantees for the EFSF. THE EUROPEAN STABILITY MECHANISM This will replace the EFSF when the facility expires in mid-2013. Euro zone leaders agreed its effective lending capacity will be 500 billion euros, ensured by a mix of paid-in capital, callable capital and guarantees. Finance ministers will try to agree on Monday the proportions in the mix and the timetable for putting it in place. LOWER INTEREST RATE ON EFSF, ESM LOANS Euro zone leaders agreed that interest on new EFSF loans would be cut to "to better take into account debt sustainability of the recipient countries, while remaining above the funding costs of the facility, with an adequate mark-up for risk, and in line with the IMF pricing principles." Leaders agreed the same principles will apply to the rates to be charged by the ESM. Finance ministers will discuss this in detail on Monday. The EFSF now charges, for variable rate loans, interest equal to three-month Euribor plus 300 basis points for loans up to 3 years and Euribor plus 400 basis points for longer loans. It also charges a one-off 50 bps fee -- well above IMF lending rates. Ireland, for example, currently pays around 5.8 percent on its loans, which it says is punitive. EFSF, ESM TO BUY COUNTRIES' BONDS AT AUCTION Euro zone leaders agreed that the EFSF will be able to buy troubled countries' bonds on the primary market, that is when they are auctioned by the sovereign. The leaders rejected an idea, backed by the European Central Bank, that the EFSF should also be able to buy bonds on the secondary market. The leaders did not agree on any other instruments, like bond buy-backs or flexible credit lines modeled on the IMF instrument. EXTENDING MATURITIES ON GREEK LOANS Euro zone leaders agreed to extend the maturity of loans to Greece to 7.5 years, doubling the repayment deadline. LOWER INTEREST ON GREEK LOANS Euro zone leaders agreed to lower the interest on their bilateral loans to Greece by 100 basis points. Ireland, which also wanted lower loan costs, did not get a reduction because it did not want to "constructively engage" in talks on coordination of a common corporate tax base. The issue is still open and Dublin will make its case again at the March 24-25 summit. BANK STRESS TESTS Euro zone leaders agreed that the level of private debt for banks, households and non-financial firms will be closely monitored in regular stress tests coordinated at EU level. The EU plans to conduct a new round of bank stress tests, possibly with more transparency, over the next few weeks to establish potential losses of banks under various scenarios and their recapitalization needs. Criteria for banks passing or failing the tests are yet to be set. Officials insist this year's tests will be much tougher than last year's, but some analysts doubt they will be tough enough; for example, they will not include assets held in lenders' bank books, allowing peripheral sovereign bonds classified as held until maturity to escape writedowns. Also, the European Banking Authority has said bank liquidity will not be a formal part of the tests, but analysts say liquidity is a crucial issue that should be assessed. Stress tests published last July initially reassured markets but the positive effect faded after Irish banks, which had done well in the tests, ran into serious trouble. PORTUGAL Portuguese yields on benchmark 10-year bonds were at a record high of 7.87 percent on Friday, and many economists believe that shortly before or after the package is formally agreed on March 24-25, the EU may extend a bailout to Portugal to address a big source of instability. But Portugal would have to request it and the government in Lisbon is strongly against that. To avoid a bailout, Lisbon presented new austerity measures on Friday [ID:nLDE72A1FJ] -- a move welcomed by euro zone leaders, the European Commission and the ECB and which helped pave the way for the leaders' deal later the same day. A euro zone source said in January that were Lisbon to seek help, the aid plan could be 60-80 billion euros. COMPETITIVENESS PACT Euro zone leaders agreed on March 11 a "competitiveness pact" which includes commitments to reforms to boost growth and employment and safeguard public finances. - A key element is that euro zone countries will enshrine EU budget deficit and debt limits in national law -- effectively making it illegal to breach them. The EU limits are 3 percent of gross domestic product for budget deficits and 60 percent of GDP for public debt. As part of toughening up the Stability and Growth Pact, the leaders also agreed that countries whose public debt exceeds 60 percent of GDP must reduce it annually by 1/20th of the amount above 60 percent. - There is also agreement to raise retirement ages in line with life expectancy, limit early retirement schemes and provide incentives for employment of workers over 55. - To make economies more competitive leaders agreed to give particular attention to ensuring that wages grow in line with productivity, including a review of wage indexation mechanisms. STRENGTHENING EU BUDGET RULES AND SURVEILLANCE Finance ministers will discuss six European Commission proposals on how to add more teeth to the existing EU budget rules -- the Stability and Growth Pact -- to prevent unchecked overspending by sovereigns in the future. The proposals, now being debated by the European Parliament which will co-decide on the outcome, concern: 1. how fast debt should be reduced every year if it is above the 60 percent EU ceiling. The Commission has proposed 1/20th of the difference to 60 each year measured over 3 years, and euro zone leaders backed that, so it seems to be agreed; 2. new sanctions for rule breakers - interest bearing deposits, non-interest bearing deposits and fines of 0.2 pct of GDP for those who do not reduce budget deficits to reach balance, who are put in an excessive deficit procedure (EDP) and who do not comply with recommendations issued under the EDP; 3. A voting mechanism that assumes sanctions are imposed once the Commission proposes them, unless a majority of countries stops them. France and Germany watered that down in October by introducing two intermediate votes before the sanctions stage to stop moving toward sanctions more easily. Euro zone leaders agreed on March 11 that finance ministers "are expected to, as a rule, follow the recommendations of the Commission or explain its position in writing." 4. Adopting EU budget rules into national legislation; This has already been agreed to by euro zone leaders on March 11. 5. Setting up an excessive imbalances procedure for countries based on a scoreboard of criteria; 6. An annual fine of 0.1 pct of GDP for a country with such imbalances if it fails to address the imbalances. (Reporting by Jan Strupczewski, editing by Tim Pearce)
