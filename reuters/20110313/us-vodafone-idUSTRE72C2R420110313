 LONDON  (Reuters) - British mobile operator Vodafone and its U.S. partner Verizon plan to combine parts of their businesses and share some equipment costs, according to a report in Britain's Sunday Times. 

 The report said the pair were examining plans to pool parts of their enterprise divisions that serve multi-national clients and that the two companies were considering buying network equipment together. Vodafone is close to striking a deal to extract a dividend from Verizon Wireless, its U.S. joint venture with Verizon, for the first time since 2005. Vodafone was not immediately available for comment. (Reporting by  Rhys Jones ; Editing by Louise Heavens)
