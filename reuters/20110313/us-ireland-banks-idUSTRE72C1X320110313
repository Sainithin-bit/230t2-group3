 DUBLIN  (Reuters) - Ireland's new government is concerned about what fresh stress tests will reveal about the health of the domestic bank sector at the end of this month, Justice Minister Alan Shatter said on Sunday. 

 "There is a concern as to what may be disclosed in the context of the stress testing as to what the banks may have so far concealed or indeed as to what information may have been available to the previous government that hasn't been revealed," Shatter told state broadcaster RTE. Asked if the issue of sharing some of the burden with banks' bondholders was off the table, Shatter said: "No." (Reporting by Carmel Crimmins; Editing by Louise Heavens)
