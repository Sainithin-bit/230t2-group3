 LONDON  (Reuters) - Following are five big themes likely to dominate thinking of investors and traders in the coming week and the Reuters stories related to them. 

 1/ PENULTIMATE CHANCE SALOON? Bonds issued by the euro zone's more indebted states are under growing pressure, which is in turn compounding pressure on European politicians to come up with durable fixes to underlying problems. Portugal is in the eye of the storm with its borrowing costs hovering around euro-era record highs that even the government deems untenable. A vicious cycle seems to be in place, with the market trying to stay ahead of credit rating agencies' downgrades. European finance ministers, meeting in the coming week, have another chance to show progress in resolving the debt crisis. The inverted nature of the Portuguese, Irish and Greek credit defaults swap curves showcase the market's view that the risk of a debt default is highest in three to four years and market skepticism about how effective any EU deal will be. The European Central Bank's recent inaction in the secondary market could embolden traders to test official tolerance limits before a Spanish bond auction on Thursday.
