 (Reuters) - Doubleday Publishing Group, a unit of Random House, the world's largest non-factual publisher, cut 10 percent of its staff on Monday, the New York Times reported. 

 The publishing group, which is owned by German media group Bertelsmann AG BERT.UL terminated 16 jobs in its editorial, publicity, advertising, marketing and administrative staffs, the paper said. "It's not a great year," Doubleday spokesman David Drake told the Times, adding, "We've had a lot of best sellers, but does that translate into the numbers that we need and that everyone is looking for? Obviously not." Drake told the paper that the decision was not related to the delay in delivery of the next novel by Dan Brown, the author of "The Da Vinci Code," the blockbuster bestseller published by Doubleday in 2003.
