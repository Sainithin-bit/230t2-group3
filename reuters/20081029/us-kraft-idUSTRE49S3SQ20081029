 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Kraft Foods Inc KFT.N posted slightly better-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday, helped by price increases and new products that boosted sales. 

 Strength in developing markets like Eastern Europe and Latin America also fueled results, while the acquisition of the Lu biscuit business gave a lift to sales in Western Europe. Kraft, like many other food companies, has raised prices on its products in the past year or so in the wake of soaring commodity costs. Those price hikes led to a 0.9 percent drop in volume. But this key result was still better than expected, given the price hikes and weak economy, Kraft CEO Irene Rosenfeld said in a statement. The largest North American food company stood by its full-year forecast for earnings before special items, with a lower tax rate offsetting higher interest expenses and the strengthening dollar. Kraft also maintained its 2009 net income outlook. Third-quarter earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding one-time items such as a gain from the sale of the Post Cereals business, were 45 cents a share. Analysts on average forecast 44 cents. Net profit rose to $1.4 billion, or 93 cents a share, from $596 million, or 38 cents a share, a year earlier. Over the past several years, Kraft has closed factories, cut jobs and divested brands to focus on areas like cookies and crackers, pizza and healthier foods. In August, Ralcorp Holdings Inc RAH.N completed the acquisition of the Post cereals business from Kraft. Sales rose 19.4 percent to $10.46 billion. Organic sales, which exclude the impact of currency, acquisitions and divestitures, rose 7.1 percent due to higher pricing. For the full year, the company still forecasts earnings per share of $1.88 before items. Analysts had forecast $1.89. The company expects 2009 net earnings of at least $2 a share. Analysts on average forecast $2.02. Kraft shares were up 17 cents at $29.05 in trading before the market opened. (Reporting by  Brad Dorfman ; Editing by  Derek Caney  and Lisa Von Ahn)
