 BOSTON  (Reuters) - A spokesman for General Electric Co said on Wednesday that a Dow Jones report quoting Chief Executive Jeff Immelt as forecasting flat profit in 2009 was "completely out of context and inaccurate." 

 Immelt's comments, made at a business group dinner in Spain, were a response to a hypothetical question about how to motivate managers during a time of financial crisis, said Russell Wilkerson, a GE spokesman. "There was no forecast, no guidance given here," Wilkerson told Reuters in a phone interview. (Reporting by  Scott Malone ; editing by Carol Bishopric)
