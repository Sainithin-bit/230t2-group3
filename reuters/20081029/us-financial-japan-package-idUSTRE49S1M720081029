 (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso has instructed ministers to come up with steps to stabilize financial markets, including tighter regulation on stock short-selling and an easing of mark-to-market accounting. 

 Tokyo is also preparing its second economic package in about two months as the global credit crisis pushes Japan into a recession, with the yen briefly touching a 13-year high against the dollar and the Nikkei share average hitting a 26-year low. Some of the steps require passage of related bills in parliament but the opposition parties, which control the upper house, have the power to delay government-sponsored bills. Japan compiled an 11.7 trillion yen ($118 billion) economic package in late August to help ease the pain from high oil prices, which includes lowering highway tolls and boosting loan guarantees for small firms. Following are key points of Japan's second economic package, based on proposals from the ruling coalition, to be finalized by the end of October: FINANCIAL SYSTEM BAILOUT (Bank recapitalization) -- The government plans to enact a bank recapitalization law allowing it to inject public funds into banks to facilitate loans to small firms. -- Economics Minister Kaoru Yosano has said the scale of bank recapitalization fund could reach 10 trillion yen ($100.9 billion), rather than the initially proposed amount of 2 trillion yen. The size has not been finalized yet. -- The plan calls for expanding the scope of coverage of the bank recapitalization law to include not only regional banks but also big banks, credit associations, and farm cooperatives and their parent bodies such as Norinchukin Bank. -- The main opposition Democratic Party has said Norinchukin should not be included in the scheme because it has focused more on investing in securities than on lending to farmers. (Easing of accounting rules) -- Japan's accounting standards body issued a statement on Tuesday clarifying existing rules on mark-to-market accounting of financial assets -- adjusting the value to reflect current market conditions -- following a move by the International Accounting Standards Board earlier this month. -- It said companies do not need to stick to mark-to-market rules for financial products when the markets for those products are extremely illiquid and fair pricing is difficult. This would include bonds and securitized products. -- The Accounting Standards Board of Japan has also begun a review of the current rules that basically ban the reclassifying of bonds held for trading purposes, which subjects them to strict mark-to-market accounting rules. The review could lead to allowing them to be reclassified as bonds to be held to maturity. -- Finance Minister Shoichi Nakagawa has said the government plans to allow banks that do not operate overseas not to deduct unrealized losses on stocks from their tier 1 capital. STEPS TO SUPPORT STOCKS -- The government is examining resuming buying of shares held by banks through a government body, which would require passage of related bills. It has asked the Bank of Japan to do the same. -- It also banned "naked" short-selling, in which traders effectively sell stocks without first borrowing them to sell. -- Extending preferential tax treatment for dividend income from stocks beyond the end of this year, which would also require passage of related bills in parliament. FISCAL STIMULUS (Size) -- The government has not worked out the scale of the additional package, but analysts expect budget spending to reach 5 trillion yen, topping the 1.8 trillion yen spending earmarked in a supplementary budget for the first fiscal package. -- Analysts also expect the size of the package, including additional spending and loan guarantee scheme for small firms, to reach 15 to 20 trillion yen. (Type of spending) -- A temporary income tax cut of around 2 trillion yen. -- Extending tax relief on housing loans and raising the upper limit on tax deductions to the highest amount ever to shore up sagging housing and real-estate businesses. -- Tax cuts for small businesses. -- Expanding government guarantees on loans to small firms to help their fund-raising. (How to finance it) -- The ruling coalition aims to finance the tax cuts and new outlays mostly using funds from the government's special account.
