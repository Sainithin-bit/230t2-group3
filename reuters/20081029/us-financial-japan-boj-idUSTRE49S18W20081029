 (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan will consider cutting interest rates for the first time in seven years this week when it assesses the impact of a global financial storm on Japan's brittle economy, a source with knowledge of the matter said. 

 A rate cut would be effectively the BOJ's first since it started a quantitative easing policy of flooding markets with cash in 2001. Following is a chronology of discount rate moves by the BOJ since 1973 and of the central bank's targets for key short-term money market rates, later specified as the overnight call loan rate, since 1995: (All figures in percent; ODR is official discount rate, which tends to serve as the ceiling for call rates and other lending rates and is used by financial institutions borrowing using the BOJ's Lombard-style facility that was introduced in March 2001. The BOJ no longer uses the term "ODR" and calls the Lombard rate the "basic loan rate.") DATE ODR/LOMBARD SHORT-TERM RATES/OVERNIGHT RATE TARGET Feb 21 2007 0.75 Lifts overnight call loan rate to 0.50 July 14 2006 0.40 Ends zero rate policy; sets overnight call loan rate at 0.25 March 9 2006 0.10 Reverts to interest rate targeting; overnight call loan rate set effectively at zero Sept 19 2001 0.10 -- March 19 2001 0.25 Adopts "quantitative easing" policy; overnight call rate left to market but forecast to fall to near zero March 1 2001 0.25 Cuts overnight call loan rate to 0.15 Feb 13 2001 0.35 -- Aug 11 2000 Ends zero rate policy; sets overnight call loan rate at 0.25 Feb 12 1999 As low as possible (zero rate policy) Sept 9 1998 0.25 Sept 8 1995 0.50 Below new ODR July 7 1995 Below ODR April 14 1995 1.00 March 31 1995 Guide short-term rates lower to maximize effectiveness of monetary easing with the current ODR Sept 21 1993 1.75 Feb 4 1993 2.50 July 27 1992 3.25 April 1 1992 3.75 Dec 30 1991 4.50 Nov 14 1991 5.00 July 1 1991 5.50 Aug 30 1990 6.00 March 20 1990 5.25 Dec 25 1989 4.25 Oct 11 1989 3.75 May 31 1989 3.25 Feb 23 1987 2.50 Nov 1 1986 3.00 April 21 1986 3.50 March 10 1986 4.00 Jan 30 1986 4.50 Oct 22 1983 5.00 Dec 11 1981 5.50 March 18 1981 6.25 Nov 6 1980 7.25 Aug 20 1980 8.25 March 19 1980 9.00 Feb 19 1980 7.25 Nov 2 1979 6.25 July 24 1979 5.25 April 17 1979 4.25 March 16 1978 3.50 Sept 5 1977 4.25 April 19 1977 5.00 March 12 1977 6.00 Oct 24 1975 6.50 Aug 13 1975 7.50 June 7 1975 8.00 April 16 1975 8.50 Dec 22 1973 9.00 Aug 29 1973 7.00 July 2 1973 6.00 May 30 1973 5.50 April 2 1973 5.00 (Reporting by Tokyo Economic Policy Desk)
