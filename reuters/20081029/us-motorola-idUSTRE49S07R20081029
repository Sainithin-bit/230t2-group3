 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Motorola Inc's MOT.N co-chief executive, Sanjay Jha, plans to make more job cuts and simplify how it makes devices, the Wall Street Journal reported on its website on Tuesday. 

 Details of the plan, which could include thousands of layoffs, could be announced Thursday, when the company reports its results, the paper said. Jha, who heads the mobile devices business, has decided to focus on Google Inc ( GOOG.O ) Android software as the operating system for many new phones, the Journal reported, citing unnamed sources. The paper said Motorola will build mid-tier devices, which account for most of its sales, around Android, while business-focused devices will be based on Microsoft Corp's ( MSFT.O ) Windows Mobile. The company will use its own platform, P2K, for low-end phones, the paper reported. The company is also seeking to outsource production of some Windows Mobile phones, the paper said. Motorola declined to comment. (Reporting by  Paritosh Bansal ; Editing by  Gary Hill )
