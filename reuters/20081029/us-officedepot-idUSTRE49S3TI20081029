 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Office Depot ( ODP.N ) posted a net quarterly loss on Wednesday, as the global financial crisis forced retail consumers and smaller businesses in the United States to cut office supply budgets. 

 The office supply retailer reported a third-quarter net loss of $6.7 million, or 2 cents a share, compared with a profit of $117.5 million, or 43 cents a share, a year earlier. Total sales fell 7 percent to $3.7 billion. North American retail sales fell 11 percent to $1.6 billion, while sales at U.S. and Canadian stores open for more than a year decreased 14 percent in the quarter. Small business owners and retail consumers have cut back on spending in the weak U.S. economy, hurting the North American office supply sector, which includes Office Depot, OfficeMax Inc OMX.N and industry leader Staples ( SPLS.O ). International sales rose 3 percent to $1 billion. (Reporting by  Aarthi Sivaraman ; Editing by  Derek Caney )
