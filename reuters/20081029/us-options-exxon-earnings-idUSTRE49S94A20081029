 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Speculators on Wednesday scooped up call options in Exxon Mobil Corp ( XOM.N ), hoping to catch a share price rally on prospects of a positive earnings report, according to one options analyst. 

 Shares of the world's largest non-government-owned energy company fell 21 cents to $74.65 on the New York Stock Exchange after notching a session high of $77.99. Options traders loaded up on Exxon calls as its shares rose earlier in the session, helped by sharp gains in crude oil futures and a Wall Street rally after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates. U.S. stocks fell in a steep sell-off late in the day. Exxon Mobil is due to deliver third-quarter results before the opening bell on Thursday. Analysts expect the company to report a profit of $2.38 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. "Basically option traders are speculating that Exxon Mobil will report third-quarter profits that would match or beat Wall Street expectations," said Joseph Hargett, senior equities analyst at Ohio-based options research firm Schaeffer's Investment Research. "Betting on Exxon Mobil at the moment is pretty much a bet that crude oil prices are going to continue to rise." In late trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, December crude hit a session high of $69.24. It earlier settled up 7.6 percent at $67.50 a barrel. SENTIMENT DRIVER One indicator of sentiment is Exxon stock's put-to-call open interest ratio for the top three months. It stood at 0.95 and lies in the 76th percentile of its annual range, data from Schaeffer's Investment Research shows. That means speculative options traders are a bit more pessimistic on the company's prospects. But Hargett noted the influx of call activity on Wednesday is a shift in sentiment, reflecting expectations of share price gains. "As a contrarian, I would view this surge of call activity negatively because it means that option traders are expecting positive earnings and that Exxon meeting Wall Street expectations may not be enough," Hargett said. Roughly 74,000 calls and 72,000 puts traded in Exxon Mobil on Wednesday, 1.6 times its normal combined volume, according to option analytics firm Trade Alert. A call conveys the right to buy the company's shares at a fixed price within a specified time period while a put enables an investor to sell the stock at a preset price and time. The busiest option was the November $80 call strike, where 14,537 contracts were situated at $2.20 a contract. For this trade to break even, Exxon shares would have to rally 10 percent between now and November 21 options expiration. By entering this trade, investors are indicating they are bullish on Exxon for the near-term, Hargett said. Technically the stock has not looked great. The shares are down 20 percent for the year. Stiff resistance is at the 20-week moving average at around $78.48 and the security has not closed above that trendline since the week of July 4, Hargett added. "This overhead resistance could cripple a November $80 call position if Exxon Mobil's recent momentum fades," he said. (Editing by Leslie Adler)
