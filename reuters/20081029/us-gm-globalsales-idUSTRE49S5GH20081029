 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) said on Wednesday that its global sales fell 11.4 percent in the third quarter, hurt by weak demand in North America and growing economic pressures in Europe. 

 GM's global sales fell to 2.1 million vehicles in the third quarter, with sales in North America, its largest market, down 18.9 percent. For the first nine months of the year, GM's global sales were down 5.8 percent, reflecting economic pressures in the U.S. and Western European markets, the company said. Economic weakness has driven U.S. industrywide auto sales to nearly 15-year lows through September amid the turmoil in the financial markets, and indications are that October is as bad or worse due to a drop in consumer confidence. GM executives said on a conference call that depressed consumer confidence was a bigger negative factor for U.S. sales than tight credit. The automaker's third-quarter sales outside the United States accounted for about 61 percent of total sales, compared with just over 56 percent a year earlier. Japanese rival Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ) decisively beat GM in global vehicle sales through the second quarter and first half of the year. The slump in U.S. demand for large SUVs and pickup trucks has hit GM particularly hard as the high-margin vehicles historically account for the majority of the automaker's sales. GM and Toyota were roughly even in 2007 for the top spot among the world's automakers, with GM slightly ahead if sales from a China business were included.
