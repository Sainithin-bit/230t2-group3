 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve cut a key interest rate by a hefty half-percentage point on Wednesday to prevent a widening credit crisis from tipping the United States into a deep and prolonged recession. 

 KEY POINTS: * The Fed's decision takes its target for overnight bank lending to 1 percent, the lowest since June 2004. * Wall Street was united in the opinion the Fed would lower rates, although views were split on the likely size of the move. * The U.S. central bank has cut benchmark overnight rates from 5.25 percent in nine steps over the past 13 months to counter a financial storm that started with the collapse of the U.S. mortgage market and spread around the world. COMMENTS: JOHN MCCARTHY, DIRECTOR OF FX TRADING, ING CAPITAL MARKETS, NEW YORK: "Not much of a reaction, it was a little bit late. The dollar rallying just a little bit against the euro although equities have given up gains. We are seeing the yen crosses rally a bit now. MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: Benchmark U.S. equity indexes shed most gains. BONDS: Treasury debt prices held at higher levels. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar pared losses against euro.
