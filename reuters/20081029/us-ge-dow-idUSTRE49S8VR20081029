 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Dow Jones Newswires plans to issue a "clarification" of a story that it published on Wednesday afternoon about comments that General Electric Co's chief executive made about the company's 2009 financial position, according to a source familiar with the matter. 

 Dow Jones reported that General Electric aims at keeping profits at the same level as this year despite the financial crisis, even if revenue falls 10 to 15 percent, citing comments reportedly made by Chief Executive Jeffrey Immelt in Madrid. A spokesman for GE said the report quoting Immelt was "completely out of context and inaccurate." Dow Jones is owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. It competes with Reuters News, a unit of Thomson Reuters Corp, in providing news and financial data. (Reporting by  Robert MacMillan )
