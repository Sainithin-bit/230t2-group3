 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut interest rates by at least a half-percentage point on Wednesday in an effort to prevent a credit crisis from tipping the United States into a deep and prolonged recession. 

 The Federal Open Market Committee, the policy-setting arm of the U.S. central bank, is expected to announce its decision at around 2:15 p.m.  EDT. It began the second day of a two-day meeting at around 9 a.m., an official said. Ten out of 14 big bond firms polled by Reuters on Monday forecast that the Fed would lower the overnight fed funds rate target a half point to 1 percent. That would be the lowest since June 2004 when the Fed was fighting a perceived risk of deflation, which some fear is about to reemerge. Some analysts believe the gloomy outlook will push the Fed to slash borrowing costs by as much as three-quarters of a point, to the lowest level in 50 years. "With confidence flat on its back, the labor market weak, and credit markets still under intense strain, we expect the FOMC to announce a 50-75 basis point rate cut," said Michael Darda, chief economist at MKM Partners in Greenwich, Connecticut. A basis point is one one-hundredth of a percentage point. Just before Fed officials began meeting, a government report showed that orders for U.S.-made durable goods rose unexpectedly last month as demand for autos and airplanes surged. The report, however, suggested the underlying trend for business investment spending was weak. The U.S. stock market was down slightly in morning trade a day after Tuesday's big rally ignited by hopes for lower interest rates and signs credit markets were thawing. .N HOW LOW WILL THEY GO? The Fed has cut rates to 1.5 percent from 5.25 percent in eight steps over the past 13 months to counter a credit crisis that started with the collapse of the U.S. mortgage market and has spread around the world. The most recent move was a surprise half-point cut between regular meetings on October 8 coordinated with a number of other central banks. In a statement accompanying that rate cut, the Fed said inflationary pressures had started to moderate and risks to growth had increased as the financial storm intensified. Other central banks are also moving to shore up their economies. China cut interest rates on Wednesday for the third time in six weeks and Norway lowered rates as well. According to a source, the Bank of Japan will consider a rate cut on Friday, which would be the first in seven years.    Economists widely expect the European Central Bank to chop rates by a half-percentage point at its November 6 meeting, according to a Reuters poll. That would lower the benchmark ECB rate to 3.25 percent, the lowest in two years. Some market participants think the Fed may be on the way to cutting rates to zero, just as Japan was forced to do to counter deflation in the 1990s. A more-forceful three-quarter point cut would be insurance against the risk of deflation. Some analysts said that the lack of a clear deflationary threat at this point in time may lead the Fed to opt for the more-incremental half-point move. "Given that deflationary forces from the collapse of the credit cycle have still not been seen, the FOMC may be reluctant to deliver a larger rate cut," said Marc Chandler, chief global currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman.
