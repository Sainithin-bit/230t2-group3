 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oil jumped more than 7 percent  on Wednesday as the dollar fell after the Federal Reserve cut U.S. interest rates. 

 The Fed cut interest rates half a percentage point, taking its target for overnight bank lending to 1 percent, the lowest since 2004. European and Asian stock markets ended higher while U.S. stocks gyrated in highly volatile trade after the rate cut, amid signs the myriad central bank and government efforts to shore up credit markets were starting to work. U.S. crude rose $4.77, or 7.6 percent, at $67.50 a barrel, then rose further to hit $68.28 in post-settlement trade. London Brent crude settled up $5.18 a barrel at $65.47. "I don't think it has a direct impact on oil demand, I don't expect it to put more cars on the road or make the coming winter colder so I'm not really looking for a direct impact on petroleum use," said Tim Evans, energy analyst for Citi Futures. "What it may do is perhaps weaken the US dollar, perhaps support the stock market, and those would be supportive factors for oil prices." The global financial crisis has hit oil demand. Crude prices have tumbled from record highs over $147 a barrel struck in July after investors poured cash into oil and other commodities as a hedge against inflation and the slumping greenback. The dollar extended losses against the euro on Wednesday after U.S. stocks rallied following the Fed's rate cut. U.S. INVENTORIES U.S. crude inventories last week rose 500,000 barrels, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, less than the 1.4-million-barrel gain analysts had expected. Distillate stocks rose 2.3 million barrels -- above the 800,000-barrel increase forecast by analysts, while gasoline stocks fell by 1.5 million barrels compared with analysts expectations of a 1.2-million-barrel build. Gasoline demand continued to fall, down 3.4 percent over the past four weeks versus the year-ago period, while total product demand was down 7.8 percent for the same period. Some OPEC members have said the producer group could cut oil production again to help support prices, after agreeing to a 1.5-million-barrel-per-day (bpd) reduction last week. "If there is a surplus in the market, if nobody needs the production, then a decision might be taken," Kuwait Oil Minister Mohammad al-Olaim told reporters. Venezuela would back an additional OPEC production cut, possibly of 1 million barrels per day, if it were necessary to stabilize crude oil prices, President Hugo Chavez said on Tuesday.
