 EVERETT, Washington  (Reuters) - Boeing Co's ( BA.N ) 27,000 machinists are feeling added economic pressure as they weigh up management's latest contract offer of a 15 percent pay raise and a little more job security. 

 Should they stay out on the picket line, braving the uncertainty of the financial crisis and a looming recession to try to slow down the company's outsourcing plans, or should they take what the union is calling a "substantial improvement" over the company's last offer? "I think the majority of members will vote for it, judging from the economy," said Chip Thom, 38, a union steward and 787 flight line inspector, speaking from the picket line outside Boeing's widebody plant in Everett, north of Seattle. Thom, who said he spent the 53 days of the strike watching "a lot of football", had to defer a monthly car payment to get by, and with only $150 per week in union strike pay, saw worse ahead. "I went from delivering airplanes to almost delivering pizzas," he said. "But I think I'll hold off (on the new job)." Others on the line, huddling, revving up motorcycles, smoking cigarettes and waving signs, were not yet convinced by the latest contract offer, which is being recommended by union leaders and management. "I don't think it's going to go through," said Shanna Lathrop, 37, a tool room clerk, who plans to study the contract's fine print before deciding how to vote on Saturday. "Basically, it's the same contract. They're just pushing the numbers around," she said. A simple majority plus one vote is required to approve or reject the contract. If approved, workers would start heading back into the plants as early as Sunday night. The new contract would expire on September 8, 2012. In the latest offer, Boeing is giving members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers a pay raise of 15 percent over four years, at least $8,000 in lump sum payments, higher pension payments, no change in healthcare and greater scope for challenging Boeing's outsourcing. The union had been pushing for a 13 percent pay raise over three years and reversal of recent outsourcing powers Boeing put in the contract three years ago. The outsourcing issue -- which the union calls "job security" and the company calls "management rights" -- was the main sticking point in negotiations. Many workers are upset about the amount of work subcontracted on the new 787 Dreamliner, and the use of a non-union, third-party logistics firm to move parts around the 787 plant. That remains unchanged in the latest contract. "With the 787, the airplane of the future, you haven't gotten rid of the subcontracting," said machinist John Jorgensen, 62, a 43-year Boeing veteran. "I see literally thousands of jobs going away after four years. Our negotiators are in a tough position." Jorgensen said he was worried about his future and the gloomy economic outlook. "I've already worked eight years longer than I planned," he said. A sticking point for some strikers is an apparent lack of a 40 cents-per-hour cost of living adjustment -- known as COLA -- that would be worth about $845 for each machinist per year, according to Kim Dove, 46, a fuel cell mechanic on the 747 wing line. "That's a takeaway," he said. "The 40-cent COLA is a huge issue, and there's a lot of concern about the fourth year in the contract," said Dove, who is advising colleagues to vote against it. Dove, who spent the seven and a half weeks of the strike "doing stuff around the house and getting caught up on my honey-do list," is prepared to strike until January. "Then, I'd have to cash in some assets," he said. (Writing by  Bill Rigby ; Editing by  Gary Hill )
