 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's Toshiba Corp ( 6502.T ) posted a 99 percent plunge in quarterly profit on Wednesday on losses on its chip business, but it kept its annual earnings forecast above expectations. 

 Sluggish chip operations also dragged down Fujitsu Ltd ( 6702.T ), as well as weak PC sales and a slump in mobile phone handsets at home, and it slashed its annual outlook to below the market consensus. Both firms are fighting a chronic slump in the chip sector that caused quarterly profit to fall at top memory chip maker Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, ( 005930.KS ) while Hynix Semiconductor Inc ( 000660.KS ) reported a loss. The entire chip sector needs to cut costs and consolidate to survive, analysts say. "Electronics firms are at the bottom of both the economic cycle and the new products cycle -- it's a double whammy," Koichi Ogawa, chief portfolio manager at Daiwa Asset Management said. A slowdown in the global economy is muting demand for electronics, leaving Toshiba, the world's No.2 maker of NAND flash memory, and Fujitsu, Japan's No.1 IT services provider, bereft of a surefire earnings driver in the quarters ahead, he said. Toshiba, whose flash memory is used in digital cameras, Apple Inc's ( AAPL.O ) iPod and mobile phones, said it would wait to gauge holiday season demand before deciding whether or not to change its outlook. Analysts expect Toshiba to revise down its outlook for an operating profit of 150 billion yen ($1.5 billion) in the year to March. The outlook for a 37 percent annual profit fall is still above the consensus estimate of 117 billion yen by 12 analysts. Toshiba, whose shares have shed about 59 percent since the start of the year, expects to break even on its chip business in October-March, based on its assumption that NAND price falls will slow to a 10 percent fall in October-December, and another 5 percent fall in January-March. Prices fell 45 percent in the six months to September 30. CASH IS KING Chip makers may think twice before spending on new equipment, now that cash is all-important as the world economy worsens and credit rating downgrades raise concerns about financing. "With nothing to help them out of this hole the balance sheet is what will determine which electronics firms will be able to grow when the economic upswing comes," said Ogawa. "Firms like Mitsubishi Electric Corp ( 6503.T ) start looking attractive." Toshiba, which bet big on nuclear reactors by buying U.S. nuclear power firm Westinghouse in 2006, has said it would build two new factories in 2010 and to further buy $1 billion worth of equipment from troubled production partner SanDisk Corp ( SNDK.O ). That brought Toshiba's debt-to-equity ratio to 1.67, not including its pension liabilities, compared with Fujitsu's 0.99 at the end of September. Toshiba reported an operating profit of 707 million yen in July-September, down from 61.3 billion yen a year earlier on a 7.3 percent fall in sales to 1.88 trillion yen. It posted a net loss of 26.9 billion yen, down from a profit of 25 billion yen the previous year. HARDWARE BLUES Rival Fujitsu, which is trying to reinvent itself as an International Business Machines Corp-styled ( IBM.N ) IT services provider, slashed its annual outlook by more than 30 percent to 150 billion yen, down 27 percent from the previous year and below expectations. It also cut its shipment forecasts for PCs, mobile phones and hard disk drives. "We are looking at a very severe second half, and that situation will probably last through April-September for devices" which include chips, Corporate Financial Officer Kazuhiko Kato said at a briefing for analysts and reporters. "We need to trim the fat." Fujitsu posted a quarterly operating profit of 32.7 billion yen, down 20 percent from the same period a year earlier, as a stronger yen and slow sales of hard drives, system chips, IT services in the U.S. and of PCs at its joint venture with Siemens ( SIEGn.DE ) outweighed outsourcing business in Europe and Japan. Prior to the results announcement shares in Toshiba, which also competes with domestic peers Hitachi Ltd ( 6501.T ) and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd ( 7011.T ), closed up 11 percent, against a rise of 7.7 percent in the benchmark Nikkei average  .N225 . Fujitsu fell 7.7 percent to 370 yen. ($1=99.12 Yen) (Reporting by  Mayumi Negishi ; Editing by  Michael Watson )
