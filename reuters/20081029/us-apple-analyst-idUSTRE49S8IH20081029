 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Shares of Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ) rallied Wednesday after an analyst said the maker of iPhones and Mac computers is in excellent position to launch a "substantial" share buyback program. 

 Apples shares closed up $4.64, or 4.6 percent, at $104.55 after rising as high as $109.54 during the session. Sanford Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi wrote in a note to clients that Apple, with a huge cash balance of $24.5 billion, could significantly boost next fiscal year's results if it elects to buy back stock. "We believe a share repurchase represents the best use of (at least part of) Apple's $25B in cash; in our view, it would be more favorable to shareholders than the alternatives of either a major acquisition or a substantial dividend," he said. Sacconaghi estimated that Apple could increase fiscal 2009 earnings per share by around 4 percent if it spent $10 billion on buybacks, and by around 9 percent if it spent $20 billion. Apple has not bought back any stock in more than 5 years, and has repurchased only $217 million's worth over the past decade. Sacconaghi said Apple shares, which have fallen about 45 percent so far this year, have been overly discounted and that he expects the company's short-term financials to remain "relatively healthy" despite economic weakness.
