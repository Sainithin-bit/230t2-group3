 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Two of the largest U.S. auto parts makers and a European supplier said on Wednesday that the global credit crisis and economic slowdown hammered their business in the just-completed quarter and would lead to more job cuts and plant closings. 

 The weak conditions caused BorgWarner Inc ( BWA.N ) to post a quarterly loss and Tenneco Inc ( TEN.N ) to announce future job cuts and plant closings, sending shares of the companies lower. Brussels, Belgium-based supplier Wabco Holdings Inc ( WBC.N ) also posted quarterly earnings below Wall Street forecasts and said it would cut about 1,000 jobs, sending its shares to a lifetime low. Shares of BorgWarner tumbled as much as 14 percent after the supplier lowered its full-year financial outlook in the wake of the results that missed Wall Street estimates. Tenneco shares were up 7 percent after earlier falling as much as 11 percent. The suppliers all expected market conditions to deteriorate further in 2009, saying the credit crisis and a worsening global economy are dampening already-weak appetite for vehicles. "The crisis in the financial sector and deteriorating global economic conditions has caused significant turmoil and uncertainty," BorgWarner Chief Executive Tim Manganello said on a conference call with analysts. "Much has changed in the past three months. The crash of the U.S. financial sector has basically frozen liquidity and our U.S. economy. The economic issues of the US have spread to other regions around the world," Manganello said. In response to the abrupt downturn in global demand, BorgWarner said it will reduce 500 jobs in Europe, or 6 percent of its workforce in the region. The supplier has also increased the number of cuts in North America by 200 to 1,200 positions, or 16 percent of its workforce. Auto parts suppliers, already pressured by U.S. auto sales at decade lows, have been forced to launch more aggressive cost-cutting actions over the past weeks in the wake of the escalating credit crisis. "As difficult as this market is, this may be one of the best quarters from an industry production perspective that we'll see in a while," Manganello said. JPMorgan analyst Himanshu Patel said BorgWarner remained its only overweight-rated U.S.-based supplier due to its relatively strong balance sheet, but added "it is too early to buy aggressively." The company's results and guidance also bodes badly for most other suppliers due to report earnings in coming days, including American Axle & Manufacturing Holdings Inc ( AXL.N ), Tenneco Inc ( TEN.N ) and TRW ( TRW.N ), Patel said. DEEPER CUTS Tenneco is cutting 1,100 jobs globally and closing four North American manufacturing plants as part of a restructuring, which it estimates will save $64 million a year. "We must act quickly by better aligning our operations with the new realities of the market." Tenneco Chief Executive Gregg Sherrill said in a statement. Tenneco expects to record up to $60 million in charges -- about $44 million in cash -- related to the restructuring steps it aims to complete by the end of 2009. The latest job cuts represent more than 5 percent of Tenneco's global workforce. The company has already slashed 1,150 jobs so far this year, including 760 in North America. Tenneco said it will also close an engineering operation in Dunsborough, Australia. BorgWarner, which makes turbochargers and transmission components, posted a third-quarter loss of $130.4 million, or $1.12 per share, compared with earnings of $83.2 million, or 70 cents per share, a year earlier. The company had posted earnings growth in the first and second quarters as overseas sales offset the slump in the U.S. auto market.<ID:N29454330> Excluding charges for restructuring, a write-down on the value of a past acquisition and other one-time charges, BorgWarner had adjusted earnings of 44 cents per share. That was below the average forecast of analysts surveyed by Reuters Estimates at 54 cents per share. Given the slowdown in auto production, BorgWarner said it now expected to earn between $2.25 and $2.35 per share, excluding one-time items, down from its own previous forecast of $2.80 to $2.95. Wabco, which makes vehicle control systems, also reported quarterly results that fell below Street expectations. Net income was $63.7 million, or 97 cents a share. Shares of BorgWarner were down 7.8 percent at $22.02 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, off an earlier low at $20.44. Tenneco shares were up 7.1 percent at $3.31, off an earlier low at $2.75. Shares of Wabco were down 13.3 percent at $16.70, after earlier hitting a record low of $11.58.
