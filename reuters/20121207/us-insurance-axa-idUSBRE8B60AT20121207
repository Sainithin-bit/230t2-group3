 PARIS  (Reuters) - French insurer AXA ( AXAF.PA ) is seeking buyers for some U.S. life insurance assets that could be worth some $500 million, Bloomberg News reported, citing three unnamed sources. 
 AXA has hired investment bank Morgan Stanley to find a buyer for the assets, which include the remants of the Mony Group Inc, a business that AXA acquired in 2004, the news service said. An AXA spokesman declined comment. Following the $1.5 billion takeover, Mony's network of financial advisers was folded into AXA's own and the unit has mostly stopped selling life insurance. In November, AXA cut its profit outlook in a sign of how low interest rates have squeezed life insurers which are committed to minimum payouts to customers. (Reporting By Christian Plumb.
