 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending rose more than expected in October as incomes increased, data showed on Wednesday, offering some hope at the start of the fourth quarter for the nascent economic recovery. 

 The Commerce Department said spending increased 0.7 percent, after a revised 0.6 percent fall in September. Consumer spending in September was previously reported as slipping 0.5 percent. October's spending was above market expectations for a gain of 0.5 percent. (Reporting by  Lucia Mutikani ; Editing by  Padraic Cassidy )
