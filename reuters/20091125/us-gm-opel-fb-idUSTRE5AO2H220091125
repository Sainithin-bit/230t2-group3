 (Reuters) - General Motors is presenting a revamp plan to Opel labor leaders on Wednesday, after deciding earlier this month to keep the European unit instead of selling a majority stake to a Russian-backed group led by Canadian parts maker Magna. 

 Below is a summary of the main GM sites in Europe: * GERMANY RUESSELSHEIM: 15,600 employees assembled 120,000 vehicles last year at Opel's headquarters. The factory builds the Vectra and Signum models as well as the new Insignia. The site also houses a technical center that carries out research and development for the GM group. BOCHUM: 5,200 workers produced close to 200,000 Astra compacts and Astra-based Zafira vans last year. Under the original Magna plan, some 2,200 jobs were at risk, according to politicians. EISENACH: 1,800 workers assembled 157,000 three-door Corsa subcompacts at the plant inaugurated in 1992 as a landmark project to revive eastern Germany's industrial structure. KAISERSLAUTERN: 3,500 employees manufacture four-cylinder petrol and diesel engines and components. Close to 150,000 engines were built there last year. GM has around 25,100 employees in total in Germany. * BRITAIN: GM has 5,500 staff at Ellesmere Port and Luton. ELLESMERE PORT: Ellesmere Port assembled 111,600 Astras and Astravans in 2008 under the Vauxhall badge, the British version of the Opel brand. LUTON: Last year built more than 60,000 Vivaro delivery vans, a larger sister to the Combo used for commercial purposes. The site is also home to production of 27,000 Renault Trafic vans. * BELGIUM: ANTWERP: 133,000 Astras were built last year in a plant that was often said to be a leading candidate for closure under Magna's plans for Opel. * POLAND: GLIWICE: 3,500 people built 170,000 vehicles last year, mainly Zafiras as well as Astras, making it a rival to Bochum for production volume. * SPAIN: ZARAGOZA: Built 423,000 vehicles in 2008, consisting of Corsas, the Meriva minivan based on the Corsa architecture and the Combo delivery van. The plant employs 7,500 and Magna had proposed cutting 1,300 to 1,650 jobs.
