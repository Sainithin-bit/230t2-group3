 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - The European Central Bank will combat threats to price stability preemptively and vigorously, ECB Governing Council member Yves Mersch said on Thursday. 

 "If indirect and second-round effects were to materialize on a large scale, monetary policy would be reactive instead of being ahead of the curve," Mersch said, according to the text of a speech he was to deliver in Frankfurt. "Once the genie of inflation is out of the bottle it might be too late. In order to avoid these effects, we will exert strong vigilance," he said. Mersch, speaking after the ECB held rates at a record low of 1.0 percent, echoed ECB President in deploying the phrase "strong vigilance" that in the past signaled a rate rise was only a month away. Mersch outlined three scenarios, which he described as the good, the bad and the ugly. "The key question is whether we are facing a 'hump' -- in other words, is this acceleration in headline inflation temporary -- or is it the edge of a plateau, where the pressure on prices is more persistent than currently assumed," he said.
