 BERLIN, March 3  (Reuters) - Divisions over how to combat the global economic crisis have morphed in a matter of months into a new disconnect between central banks in the United States and Europe on the threat posed by commodity-fuelled inflation. 

 Rhetoric from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet this week underscored a deep transatlantic divide that has opened up at a time when surging oil, political pressures and mixed economic signals are adding to the challenge for monetary policymakers. The message from Trichet after the ECB's monthly policy meeting on Thursday was crystal clear -- the Frankfurt-based bank is worried about euro zone inflation, which at 2.4 percent has climbed to its highest level since October 2008, and is prepared to act, perhaps as early as next month. "Strong vigilance is warranted with a view to containing upside risks to price stability," Trichet said, using a phrase that in the past has signalled a rate rise is imminent. The Frenchman described a hike in April as "not certain" but "possible". The Bank of England, which has held fire despite an inflation rate that is double its 2.0 percent target, is expected to tighten soon too, most likely in the second or third quarter of this year. Before today, few would have predicted the ECB would move first. But in Washington, where Bernanke delivered his semi-annual report to Congress earlier this week, the chances of a rate hike in 2011 look slim, despite the surge in oil above $100 per barrel and clear signs the U.S. recovery is gathering speed. Bernanke told the Senate Banking Comittee on Tuesday that he expected oil prices to have only a modest, temporary impact on U.S. inflation "at most" and said the Fed remained preoccupied with weak job creation. The contrast is as stark as it was last year when the Fed embarked on a second round of "quantitative easing", dubbed QE2, despite denunciations of the money-printing policy in Europe and Asia. "We seem headed for a historically unusual event where the ECB and the BOE will raise rates ahead of the Fed," said Nick Matthews, an economist at RBS in London.
