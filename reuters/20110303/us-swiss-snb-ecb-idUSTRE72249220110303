 ZURICH  (Reuters) - The tough talk on inflation from European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet has also boosted expectations that the Swiss National Bank may move earlier on interest rates than anticipated. 

 Interest rate futures now price in a full first post-crisis rate hike in Switzerland for September with a certain chance of a move even in June after Trichet said an ECB interest rate hike as soon as April was possible. "Obviously this would give the SNB more leeway on the currency front and the franc has been its main focus recently," UBS analyst Reto Huenerwadel said. "So it means that a SNB rate move will come sooner rather than later." Markets had been pricing in a December move until last week, but a string of strong Swiss economic data pushed bets forward somewhat. The record-high Swiss franc is seen as the major obstacle to a SNB rate hike as higher rates may give the currency an additional boost. But the franc dropped nearly 1.5 percent against the euro on Trichet's comments. However, a hike at the SNB's quarterly meeting on March 17 was still unlikely given recent comments from Swiss policy makers, Huenerwadel said. "The debate will now be whether a June or September hike is on the cards," he said. Huenerwadel expects the SNB to move in June. The SNB's vice-chairman Thomas Jordan said on Thursday before the ECB's statement the Swiss central bank had no urgent need to raise rates but monetary policy is too loose for the longer term.
