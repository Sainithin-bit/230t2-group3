 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A prolonged disruption in Libyan oil exports could force the United States to compete more for supplies as Europe buys Algerian crude normally sent to the American market, the U.S. energy forecasting agency said on Wednesday. 

 Most of Libya's oil output goes to European countries so they would have to replace oil of a similar quality that can be processed by their refineries. "Unlike Libyan production, more than a third of Algeria's light, sweet crude (a possible substitute from fields relatively close to Libya's) is shipped to U.S. refiners, which sometimes use it as a blending stock to lighten heavier crude grades," the Energy Information Administration said in its weekly review of the oil market. "Should those volumes find a stronger market in Europe, U.S. end-users would have to look for alternate supplies," the agency said. Oil from Nigeria, which is now the fourth biggest foreign oil supplier to U.S. market, could also find new buyers in Europe that would compete with the American market, the EIA said. The agency said the one good thing about the current supply disruption is that it is occurring at a time of year when oil demand is relatively low and crude maintenance in the North Sea and elsewhere is low during the first quarter. "Should it be prolonged, it could conflict with a seasonal ramp up in refinery production ahead of the peak summer driving season," the EIA warned. U.S. oil prices settled at the highest level since August 2008 on Wednesday at more than $102 a barrel after an airstrike near Libya's oil infrastructure.
