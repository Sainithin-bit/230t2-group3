 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - European Central Bank staff forecast euro zone inflation to overshoot the central bank's target this year, but to fall back to below the 2 percent upper limit in 2012. 

 ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet said staff expected inflation to be 2.0-2.6 percent in 2011 -- giving a midpoint of 2.3 percent -- and between 1.0 and 2.4 percent in 2012. The December staff projections were for inflation of 1.3 to 2.3 percent in 2011 and a range of 0.7 to 2.3 percent in 2012. Euro zone inflation accelerated to 2.4 percent last month, moving further above the ECB's target of just below 2 percent. The ECB's latest quarterly forecasts saw growth in a range of 1.3 and 2.1 percent this year -- giving a midpoint of 1.7 percent -- from the 0.7 to 2.1 percent seen in December. Next year, growth is expected to be between 0.8 and 2.8 percent, for a midpoint of 1.8 percent, from 0.6 to 2.8 percent previously. The bank's in-house economists' projections are roughly in line with the latest set of European Commission forecasts published earlier this week which saw 2011 growth at 1.6 percent and inflation at 2.2 percent.
