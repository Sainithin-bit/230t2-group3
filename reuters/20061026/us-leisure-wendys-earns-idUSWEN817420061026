 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Wendy's International Inc. WEN.N on Thursday reported slightly lower quarterly earnings due to a smaller number of restaurants and higher costs. 

 Third-quarter net income was $72 million, or 61 cents per share, compared with $72.1 million, or 61 cents per share, a year ago. Earnings from continuing operations were 16 cents per share, Wendy's said.
