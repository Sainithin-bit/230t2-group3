 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Raytheon Co. ( RTN.N ) on Thursday said third-quarter profit rose, helped by higher sales of military equipment and business jets and a reduction in pension costs. 

 The top-tier defense contractor, which makes Tomahawk missiles, a range of defense electronics and Hawker business jets, also raised its full-year earnings forecast but said it expected 2007 profit just below Wall Street's average estimate. The Waltham, Massachusetts, company said net profit increased to $321 million, or 71 cents per share, from $228 million, or 50 cents per share, a year earlier. Profit from continuing operations was 72 cents per share, which beat Wall Street's average forecast of 64 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Results were helped by lower pension costs of $93 million in the quarter, down from $117 million a year ago. Revenue rose 7 percent to $5.69 billion, short of analysts' average forecast of $5.78 billion. Based on its better-than-expected performance, Raytheon raised its full-year earnings forecast 10 cents per share to a range of $2.70 to $2.80 per share. Wall Street is expecting $2.72 per share, on average. For 2007, Raytheon made its first earnings forecast of $2.95 to $3.05 per share. Analysts are expecting $3.09 per share, on average. The company forecast revenue of $24.6 billion to $25.1 billion for 2007. Analysts are expecting $24.68 billion, on average. Third-quarter results were boosted by higher sales at its integrated defense unit, which rose 12 percent to $1.03 billion, and its missile systems unit, which posted sales 8 percent higher at $1.08 billion. Its network centric systems unit, which makes air traffic control, navigation and surveillance gear, posted sales up 6 percent at $879 million. Its space and airborne systems unit posted sales 6 percent higher at $1.07 billion, while its technical services unit reported sales rose 6 percent to $509 million. Raytheon's aircraft unit, which in July it said it was looking to sell, posted sales 18 percent higher at $758 million, on the back of a global surge in business jet purchases. It delivered 113 jets to customers in the quarter, up from 80 in the year-ago quarter. The unit, which makes jets under the Hawker and Beechcraft names, took orders for 104 new planes in the quarter, up from 82 in the same quarter last year. Raytheon's intelligence and information systems unit was the only business to post lower sales, down 4 percent to $626 million.
