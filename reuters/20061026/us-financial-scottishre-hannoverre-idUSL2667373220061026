 NEW YORK/LONDON  (Reuters) - Scottish Re SCT.N shares surged more than 6 percent on Thursday after an analyst said the reinsurer's search for a buyer was at an "advanced phase," even as a source said one of six bidders had pulled out. Shares in Scottish Re, which buys blocks of life insurance from other insurers, rose 59 cents, or 5.5 percent, to close at $11.24, their highest level since July, when they plunged 75 percent after the company announced a liquidity crunch, a big second-quarter loss and its chief executive's resignation. One of the six bidders for the company, Frankfurt-based Hannover Re ( HNRGn.DE ), has dropped out of the bidding, a source familiar with the situation said. Bear Stearns analyst Saul Martinez said that based on past conversations with management, he expected the company to reveal a sale of the company simultaneous with its third-quarter earnings announcement. Scottish Re has not said when it will report third-quarter earnings but under normal circumstances they would be announced on or before November 10. Martinez said in a report that a broad range for the price of the company would be $10 to $19 a share, but the winning bid would likely come in below the high end. The mid-point of the that range is $14.50 a share, a 36 percent premium to Wednesday's close, he said. "We believe the most likely outcome is the sale of Scottish Re as an entire entity and at a premium to the existing share price," said Martinez. But he acknowledged that risks exist. Hannover Re was one of six firms that were in the second phase of bidding for the Bermuda-based life reinsurer, but has now withdrawn from the process, the source said. Some analysts had regarded the German firm as the likely front-runner to buy its rival. "It's difficult to interpret this. It could simply mean that somebody else is now in the lead. I would think if there were problems with the (Scottish Re) business they would have dropped out earlier," said Richard Sbaschnig, analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. French reinsurer Scor ( SCOR.PA ) may now be among the favorites to enter exclusive negotiations with Scottish Re over a possible sale, analysts said. Scottish Re put itself up for sale in August following a big second-quarter loss and the departure of its chief executive. Earlier this month, the company said it had obtained $120 million in new financing to ease its liquidity problems, having earlier reduced some of its credit facilities at its operating companies. Hannover Re declined to comment and Scor was not available for comment.
