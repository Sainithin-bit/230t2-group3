 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Universal Health Services Inc.( UHS.N ) said on Thursday quarterly earnings jumped as costs fell and strength in its behavioral health unit offset medical debt in its acute hospital division. 

 Net income rose to $113.9 million, or $2.00 per share, from $8.3 million, or 15 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, the company said it earned 54 cents a share during the quarter. Wall Street analysts polled by Reuters' Estimates had forecast an adjusted profit of 61 cents per share.
