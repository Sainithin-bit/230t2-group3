 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - New York Stock Exchange owner NYSE Group Inc. NYX.N on Thursday said third-quarter profit more than tripled, boosted by expanded operating margins and growth in trading volume. 

 Net income, including merger-related charges, rose to $68 million, or 43 cents per share, from $22 million, or 19 cents per share, a year earlier. The results beat the analysts' average forecast of 41 cents per share before special items, according to Reuters Estimates. NYSE Group said average daily volume across all categories of securities had increased during the quarter, including growth of 11 percent in NYSE-listed and 27 percent in Nasdaq-listed issues. NYSE had an active first half of the year, acquiring listed electronic trading platform Archipelago Holdings Inc. in March and striking a $10 billion deal in June to take over Paris-based exchange operator Euronext ENXT.PA. Euronext accepted NYSE's takeover bid over a rival offer by Frankfurt-based Deutsch Boerse, but the deal remains controversial in France and elsewhere in Europe and has not won final regulatory clearance. Included in NYSE's quarterly results are expenses of $5.1 million for the integration of the Archipelago businesses and $2.6 million for the Euronext merger. The company's shares are up 51 percent so far this year, far exceeding the 22 percent gain for the KBW Capital Markets Index .KSX.
