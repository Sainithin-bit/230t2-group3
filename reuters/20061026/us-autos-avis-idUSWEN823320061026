 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Avis Budget Group, Inc. CAR.N announced Thursday the restructuring of its Budget Truck Rental subsidiary, including the closing of its headquarters and elimination of 50 positions. 

 Budget Truck Rental's headquarters in Denver, Colorado will close in early 2007. Out of 290 jobs, about 50 will be eliminated and 90 employees have been offered relocation. People who have lost their position or are being displaced will receive severance payments and outplacement assistance. Gerald Riordan, president of Budget Truck Rental, will also leave the company after his position was eliminated. Joseph Ferraro, formerly regional manager of Avis Budget Group's New York/Washington car rental operations, was named vice president, operations, for Budget Truck Rental. The restructuring is expected to generate annualized savings of $5 million beginning in 2008 and the company will record a one-time pretax charge of about $10-12 million.
