 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Sony Corp. said on Thursday it swung to a quarterly loss due to the mounting cost of recalling millions of computer batteries, coming in sharp contrast to a surge in profit at rival Nintendo Co. on its hit DS handheld game machine. 

 The deep loss at Sony comes despite the boost of a softer yen and robust sales of flat TVs and digital cameras, factors that are expected to lifted earnings at Panasonic maker Matsushita Electric Industrial, which reports on Friday. Top personal computer makers including Dell Inc., Apple Computer Inc., Toshiba Corp. and Sony itself are recalling up to 9.6 million Sony-made computer batteries, which in rare cases can overheat and catch fire. Sony kept its forecast for a sharp fall in annual profit and warned that a price war in the flat TV market could heat up. "I know that companies like Sharp, Samsung and Panasonic will all stage a full-out offensive during the year-end shopping season. We will take necessary steps to respond," Sony Chief Financial Officer Nobuyuki Oneda told a news conference. Sony, which competes with Nintendo and Microsoft Corp. in video games and the likes of Sharp Corp. and Matsushita in flat TVs, posted a group operating loss of 20.83 billion yen ($175 million) in the July-September second quarter. That compares with a restated 74.56 billion yen profit in the same quarter a year earlier. Sales rose 8.3 percent to 1.85 trillion yen. Nintendo, meanwhile, said its operating profit more than trebled in the fiscal first half, buoyed by its hot-selling DS handheld game device, and it stood by its annual outlook for 60 percent profit growth. Kyoto-based Nintendo has scored a smash hit with the DS, which allows players to give commands using a stylus instead of a key pad and has attracted game novices by offering casual and easy-to-play games. April-September operating profit at Nintendo, known for game characters such as Mario, Donkey Kong and Pokemon, totaled 67.1 billion yen ($565 million), up from 19.6 billion yen a year earlier. Sales rose 69.4 percent to 298.82 billion yen. SONY SEES GAME LOSS Nintendo earlier this month revised up its earnings forecasts for both the April-September first half and full year to March 2007. It also raised its DS sales forecast for the year to March by 3 million units to 20 million. Sony's result was also well flagged because last week it had cut its full-year operating profit forecast by 62 percent due to an estimated 51 billion yen in recall costs and a wider loss at its game unit, and said its second quarter loss likely came to 21 billion yen. The battery recall has shaken consumer confidence in Sony's technological competitiveness and cast a shadow over its brand image as a top class manufacturer, which has in the past enabled it to charge a premium for its products. Compounding difficulties at Sony, the maker of Bravia brand liquid crystal display (LCD) TVs and Cyber-shot digital cameras, is a bloating loss at its video game division. Sony said last week that losses at its game unit will likely balloon to 200 billion yen in the year to next March 31 because of sluggish sales of PlayStation Portable handheld players and a price cut for a model of the PlayStation 3 game console in Japan. It plans to launch the PlayStation 3 in Japan and North America next month, fighting with Nintendo's Wii and Microsoft's Xbox 360 for holiday shoppers' attention in the nearly $30 billion video game industry. For the year to March, Sony reiterated its week-old operating profit estimate of 50 billion yen, down from a revised 226.42 billion yen a year earlier. That compares with the consensus of 75 billion yen in a poll of 14 analysts by Reuters Estimates. Nintendo kept its previous operating profit forecast of 145 billion yen, a touch below the 148 billion yen consensus. Shares in Nintendo closed down 0.5 percent at 24,200 yen prior to the announcement, underperforming the benchmark Nikkei average, which rose 0.67 percent. Shares in Sony closed flat at 4,820 yen. Sony's stock lost 5 percent in the July-September quarter, while the sub-index rose 3 percent.
