 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Kellogg Co. ( K.N ), the No. 1 maker of breakfast cereal, on Thursday reported a 2.5 percent rise in quarterly earnings that beat Wall Street estimates as strong sales helped offset higher prices on commodities like fuel and grains. 

 The producer of Frosted Flakes cereal and Keebler cookies also raised its 2006 earnings forecast, citing strength in the first nine months of the year, and its stock rose 1.7 percent. Kellogg has benefited in recent years from a steady stream of new, higher-priced cereals such as fruit varieties of Special K, and by expanding its presence in growing categories like breakfast bars and fruit snacks. But like many U.S. food makers, the Battle Creek, Michigan,-based company has been hit hard by soaring energy, grain and sugar costs. Last month, the company raised prices on some cereals by 2 percent to help offset the increased costs. Third-quarter net income rose to $281.1 million, or 70 cents per share, from $274.3 million, or 66 cents per share, a year ago. Analysts, on average, expected Kellogg to earn 65 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 7.6 percent to $2.82 billion, well above analysts' expectations of about $2.75 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Cereal sales in North America were up 3 percent, a sharp decrease from an 11 percent rise last year. Kellogg President David Mackay said the results were driven by demand for adult cereal brands like Smart Start and Mini-Wheats. "If you look at the demographics in markets like the U.S. where you have an aging population, as people age they typically come back to cereal," Mackay said. "We're just trying to reflect through our innovation and what we do the market dynamics." D.A. Davidson analyst Tim Ramey said he had been expecting cereal sales to be down from last year's robust level. "That's a good year-on-year rate of change given the performance last year," said Ramey, who has a "buy" rating on Kellogg shares and owns none. "It was a very solid sales performance across the board." Snack sales rose 11 percent in North America, helped by strong demand for new snack-sized versions of Pop-Tarts toaster pastries called Go-Tarts and Cheez-It crackers. Gross margins, a measure of profitability, fell slightly from last year but improved from earlier this year in part because of lower restructuring costs. Margins are also expected to be up in the fourth quarter due to higher prices and cost-savings initiatives, Kellogg Chief Financial Officer Jeff Boromisa said on a conference call with analysts. Margins in 2007 are expected to be comparable to 2006. Kellogg now expects earnings of $2.48 to $2.50 a share for the year, compared with its previous forecast of $2.45 to $2.49 per share. The view includes up to 30 cents of increased costs due to energy and commodities as well as 15 cents of what Kellogg called "up-front" costs, or restructuring expenses. For 2007, the company forecast earnings of $2.67 to $2.72 a share, with sales up in the low single digits on a percentage basis. Analysts looked for $2.51 a share for 2006 and $2.74 in 2007, according to Reuters Estimates. Earlier this week, Kellogg said that Mackay will become chief executive as of December 31, replacing Jim Jenness, who will continue as chairman. Kellogg shares were up 84 cents, or 1.7 percent, at $50.48 in mid-day trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has gained 16.8 percent so far this year, compared with a 10.5 percent rise in the Standard & Poor's Packaged Foods index  .15GSPFOOD. (Additional reporting by  Brad Dorfman  in Chicago)
