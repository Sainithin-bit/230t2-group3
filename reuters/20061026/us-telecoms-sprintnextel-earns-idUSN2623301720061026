 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Sprint Nextel Corp. ( S.N ) on Thursday reported a fall in third-quarter profit due to merger-related costs, and posted wireless subscriber growth that missed already low analyst estimates. 

 Sprint, the No. 3 U.S. wireless service, has been losing market share to rivals this year as it grappled with criticism of its network quality, its marketing message and its cell phone line-up as it weeds out bad debt customers and struggles to integrate its Nextel purchase. The company said it had added 233,000 net new subscribers in the quarter, just below average forecasts of nearly 239,000 from 12 analysts contacted by Reuters. It lost a net 188,000 postpaid customers -- seen as the most valuable and predictable as they pay monthly bills -- and blamed voluntary and involuntary departures. Sprint has had to force some customers who did not pay bills to leave. Investors, who have shaved about 30 percent off Sprint's share price since its problems started to emerge six months ago, would need to hear signs of a turnaround on its earnings conference call before changing their views, analysts said. "Wireless subscriber growth was a little weaker than we expected," said Stanford Group analyst Michael Nelson. "There's nothing in the numbers that gives me more or less confidence in the company's ability to turn around the wireless business." Sprint's net profit fell to $247 million, or 8 cents per share, from $516 million, or 23 cents a share, a year earlier. The year-earlier numbers reflected that Sprint did not own Nextel Communications until August 12, 2005. Excluding 22 cents of amortization costs plus other items, Sprint said it earned 32 cents per share. On that basis, analysts, on average, had expected 33 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose to $10.496 billion from $7.825 billion, compared with average analyst estimates of $10.48 billion. Analysts say Sprint is losing market share to its biggest rival, Cingular Wireless, and the No. 2 U.S. service, Verizon Wireless, owned by Verizon Communications Inc. ( VZ.N ) and Vodafone Group Plc ( VOD.L ). Cingular, the venture of AT&T Inc. ( T.N ) and BellSouth Corp. BLS.N, last week posted total net subscriber additions of 1.35 million for the quarter. Sprint said it was maintaining its forecast for full-year revenue of $41 billion to $41.5 billion and operating income of $12.9 billion before depreciation and amortization. The company said its postpaid customer cancellation rate, known in the industry as churn, rose to 2.4 percent from 2.1 percent in the second quarter. Sprint said its average monthly revenue per direct postpaid user was down 5.5 percent from a year ago at $61. Sprint shares closed at $17.72 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.
