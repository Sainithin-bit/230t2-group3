 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - New orders for U.S.-made durable goods boomed a much greater-than-expected 7.8 percent in September on a rush of civilian aircraft orders, but rose less than forecast when volatile transportation orders were stripped from the total, a government report showed on Thursday. 

 The biggest jump in durables orders since June 2000 was propelled by a 183.2 percent rise in nondefense aircraft and parts orders, according to the Commerce Department. That was the highest gain since a 210.4 percent rise in July 2002. Excluding transportation, orders for durable goods -- items meant to last three or more years -- rose a modest 0.1 percent. It was the first increase since June. Analysts polled by Reuters were expecting a 1.9 percent climb in durables orders and a 1.0 percent gain when transportation orders were excluded. When defense orders were stripped out, durables orders rose 6.3 percent. That was well above the 0.5 percent increase analysts were expecting. A proxy for business spending, non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, rose a larger-than-expected 1.1 percent. Analysts forecast a 0.8 percent gain in that category.
