 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The number of U.S. workers applying for jobless benefits rose by 8,000 last week to 308,000, in line with expectations and still pointing to a relatively healthy job market, a government report on Thursday showed. 

 The latest figures from the Labor Department cover the week ended October 21. The department revised the number of applicants for the prior week ended October 14 to 300,000 from a previously reported 299,000. The four-week moving average of new claims -- regarded as a more accurate indicator of long-term labor conditions -- dropped to its lowest level in nearly eight months. The average fell to 305,250 last week from 308,000 in the prior week, its lowest since 301,500 in the week ended February 25. The number of people who remained on the benefit rolls after drawing an initial week of aid rose by 3,000 to 2.449 million in the week ended October 14, the latest week for which the data were available.
