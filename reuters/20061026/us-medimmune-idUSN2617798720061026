 BOSTON  (Reuters) - MedImmune Inc. MEDI.O said on Thursday that its third-quarter loss narrowed as sales of its respiratory drug Synagis and flu vaccine FluMist rose. 

 The Gaithersburg, Maryland-based biotechnology company posted a net loss of $56 million, or 23 cents a share, including stock-based compensation expenses, compared to a loss of $64 million, or 26 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue rose 15 percent, to $177 million. Excluding stock option expenses the company reported a loss of 30 cents a share, in line with analysts' expectations, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales of Synagis rose 11 percent to $112 million, while sales of FluMist rose 52 percent to $16 million. The company also received about $7 million in royalty and milestone payments from the European approval and U.S. sales of Merck & Co.'s ( MRK.N ) human papillomavirus vaccine. The company said sales of Synagis were driven by an increased focus on commercialization, including completing the expansion and training of its pediatric infectious disease sales force, and working with physicians and nurses to better identify and track appropriate patients. The company said it has sold about 1.7 million doses of FluMist so far this year, compared with the 1.3 million doses it sold for the entire season last year. The company said it has increased its 2006 earnings estimate to a range of 17 cents to 22 cents a share, excluding share based compensation expenses, due to the gain on an investment. The company said it continues to believe that total revenue for 2006 will increase about 4 percent to about $1.3 billion.
