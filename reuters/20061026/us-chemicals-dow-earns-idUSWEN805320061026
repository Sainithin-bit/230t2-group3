 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Dow Chemical Co. ( DOW.N ) on Thursday said quarterly profit before a restructuring charge topped forecasts as price increases for its products offset higher raw materials and energy costs. 

 Excluding special items, the Midland, Michigan-based company posted earnings of 98 cents a share, beating the average analyst forecast of 91 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Including $579 million in charges related to the shutdown of several of its plants, net income fell to $512 million, or 53 cents a share, from $801 million, or 82 cents a share, a year earlier. The largest U.S. chemical maker also announced that its board of directors had approved a $2 billion share buyback program once its current buyback plan ends. Dow benefited from an average 11 percent increase in selling prices for its products, which boosted its margins despite an increase of nearly $750 million in raw materials and energy costs. "Looking ahead, we expect the solid demand seen by many of our businesses in the third quarter to continue into the fourth quarter, although the ongoing volatility in feedstock and energy costs creates some uncertainty in relation to the dynamics of customer buying patterns," Geoffery Merszei, chief financial officer, said in statement. Dow said its performance segments saw strong growth, particularly in Asia Pacific where volumes grew 17 percent versus a year ago. Sales for the quarter rose 10 percent to $12.36 billion from $11.26 a year ago, beating analysts' average forecast of $12.082 billion. Basic plastics posted sales of $3.1 billion, up 15 percent over last year, helped by a 20 percent increase in sales prices even as volumes sold declined by 5 percent. Basic chemicals sales climbed 13 percent to $1.5 billion in the quarter. The performance plastics segment posted sales of $3.5 billion, up 9 percent from a year ago, while performance chemicals sales rose 8 percent to $2.0 billion. Shares of the company, whose products are used in everything from antifreeze to plastic pipes, have risen about 17 percent over the last three months, outperforming a gain of about 11 percent for the Standard & Poor's Chemical index .GSPPM.
