 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Thursday, with the Dow hitting another record high, as strong earnings from Exxon Mobil Corp. ( XOM.N ) and health insurer Aetna Inc. ( AET.N ) outweighed concern that the market may be overpriced. 

 The Nasdaq Composite Index received one of its biggest lifts from Comcast Corp. ( CMCSA.O ), the largest U.S. cable operator, which reported a stronger-than-expected increase in quarterly profit. For details, see <ID:nN26443346>. Comcast shares rose 3.2 percent, or $1.24, to $40.00. The Dow Jones industrial average has hit a new record high in 12 of the past 17 sessions and been on a gradual ascending path since mid-July, prompting some investors to ask whether companies' performances will continue to justify prices. "Investors are beginning to buy stocks in sectors, such as energy, that were left behind somewhat during the recent rally," said Subodh Kumar, chief investment strategist at CIBC World Markets in Toronto. "Valuations in some groups may be stretched, but there are still gains to be made." The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  gained 28.98 points, or 0.24 percent, to close at a record 12,163.66. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  rose 6.86 points, or 0.50 percent, to end at 1,389.08. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  climbed 22.51 points, or 0.96 percent, to close at 2,379.10, a 5 1/2-year high. Earlier, the Dow rose as high as 12,167.02, an intraday record. Shares of Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT.O ), the world's largest software maker, rose to $28.54 in late composite electronic trading after the bell, after initially falling in extended-hours activity. Microsoft reported a higher quarterly net profit, boosted by a strong performance at its database software division.<ID:nN26233748> But the company also said deferred revenue of $1.5 billion related to its new Windows launch will hurt the current quarter. In regular trading on Nasdaq, Microsoft closed at $28.35. BETTING ON OIL AND INSURANCE Exxon Mobil shares rose 0.9 percent, or 61 cents, to $71.62 and Aetna's stock jumped 7.4 percent, or $2.86, to $41.39 on the New York Stock Exchange. Quarterly results for both companies beat Wall Street expectations. Property and casualty insurers rose, with shares of No. 1 U.S. insurer American International Group Inc. ( AIG.N ) up 1.4 percent, or 95 cents, at $67.78, after St. Paul Travelers STA.N was the latest in the group to beat estimates on solid quarterly numbers. AIG was one of the Dow's biggest gainers and among the S&P 500's top advancers. St. Paul shares rose 4.3 percent, or $2.07, to $50.66. Clear Channel Communications Inc. ( CCU.N ), the largest U.S. radio company, gained nearly 10 percent, or $3.13, to $35.48 on news that a group of private-equity firms were in advanced talks to buy the company.<ID:nN25413164> BOEING DROPS FOR SECOND DAY Pressuring the Dow was Boeing Co. ( BA.N ), which shed 2.1 percent, or $1.72, to $79.14, a day after the jet plane manufacturer issued a disappointing forecast for 2007. Stocks showed little reaction to a government report showing orders for U.S-made durable goods rose 7.8 percent in September -- sharply exceeding expectations. Excluding volatile transportation orders, though, September durable goods orders fell 0.1 percent -- much weaker than expected. Volume was heavy on the NYSE, where about 1.74 billion shares changed hands, above last year's daily average of 1.61 billion. On the Nasdaq, about 2.45 billion shares were traded, above last year's daily average of 1.80 billion. Gainers outnumbered decliners on both the Big Board and the Nasdaq by about 2 to 1.
