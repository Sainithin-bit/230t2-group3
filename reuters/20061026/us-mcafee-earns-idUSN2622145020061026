 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - McAfee Inc. MFE.N, the No. 2 security software maker, on Thursday posted higher quarterly profit and revenue that topped Wall Street forecasts, reflecting demand across all businesses and geographies. 

 The company's shares rose nearly 6 percent in extended trade. Third-quarter net income rose to $30.3 million or 19 cents per share from $22.5 million, or 13 cents per share a year ago. Excluding items the company said its per-share profit was 36 cents. This was above the Wall Street view of 30 cents on revenue of $275.9 million as compiled by Reuters Estimates. "They delivered solid results across the board," said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR. "It is evidence of a strong product cycle." The company said the results were preliminary because of a previously announced need to restate past financial statements to record additional noncash charges for stock-based compensation expense. Earlier in October, McAfee fired its president, Kevin Weiss, and said its chairman and chief executive, George Samenuk, would retire after an internal probe into the software maker's stock option practices. The company also said it expected to take a charge of $100 million to $150 million to restate earnings to reflect more stock-based compensation expense. At least 140 companies, many of them based in Silicon Valley, have launched internal investigations or are facing probes by federal regulators to determine if the dates of stock options were manipulated. The Justice Department and Internal Revenue Service are also examining possible wrongdoing. McAfee's results also come a day after its rival Symantec Corp. ( SYMC.O ), the world's biggest security software maker, posted quarterly earnings and an outlook at the low end of expectations as its sales struggled in Europe. McAfee's third-quarter revenue rose to $287.8 million from $252.9 million a year ago. Bookings during the quarter increased 16 percent to $349 million with growth in North America particularly strong, the company said. Corporate revenue rose 14 percent to $168 million while sales of the company's consumer products increased 14 percent to $120 million. Santa Clara, California,-based McAfee also said it planned to spend its surplus cash on research and development, small- to mid-sized acquisitions and share buybacks. It added, however, that it could not buy back shares due to the ongoing stock option review and pending restatement. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, McAfee expects revenue between $275 million to $295 million with earnings per share before items of 31 cents to 35 cents. Analysts on average were looking for revenue of $287 million with earnings per share before items of 33 cents for the fourth quarter, according to Reuters Estimates. McAfee shares rose nearly 6 percent to $28.30 in extended trade from a close of $26.82 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday.
