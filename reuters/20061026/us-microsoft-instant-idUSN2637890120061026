 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. posted a rise in quarterly net profit on Thursday, boosted by a strong performance at its database software division. 

 The following are comments from market sources. COMMENTARY: TOAN TRAN, ANALYST, MORNINGSTAR "It looks like Microsoft had a good quarter. They beat on the EPS and revenues were pretty much in line. People might be concerned that operating income may drop in the next quarter, but what's happening is that they're deferring revenues for an upgrade program to Windows Vista. "It really has no effect on cash flow Microsoft has. It just won't be recognized until the third quarter of 2007." KIM CAUGHEY, ANALYST FORT PITT CAPITAL, PITTSBURGH "My first take is it was impressive on the top line and the bottom line. We are looking forward because we as owners are glad to see they are raising their guidance. "All things look good at this point. Their server and tool numbers, we are very happy with that. That is the barometer for the other stocks we own. We weren't expecting anything special from operating systems because it's a soft market." MIKE BINGER, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, THRIVENT FINANCIAL "This quarter doesn't have much of a bearing on what's going on. They ... did a little bit better than what they guided to for the September quarter. I think the PC cycle is pretty good and then they went ahead and they lowered revenue for the December quarter and raised it for the first quarter, which I think people knew. "They left the year unchanged. I think not even Microsoft itself knows it (can't) give better guidance for the year until Vista unfolds. Everything stayed the same and that's reflected in the stock being up or down a dime." BRIAN BARISH, PRESIDENT OF CAMBIAR INVESTORS, DENVER: "On balance the numbers looking pretty good. I didn't see anything to be terribly upset about. The numbers seem fine. The reality with a company this large is that almost everything is a pretty slow burn. "The item that freaked everybody out earlier this year was very aggressive expense growth, and even though revenues should grow above trend with Vista, you weren't going to see much earnings growth. But that issue has been dealt with and numbers got rebased by Wall Street." KURT BRUNNER, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, SWARTHMORE GROUP,  PHILADELPHIA "My first blush, what they reported looks good, and it looks like they're guiding a little lower, below consensus next quarter."
