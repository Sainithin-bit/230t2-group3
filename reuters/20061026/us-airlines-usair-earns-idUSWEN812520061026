 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - US Airways Group Inc. ( LCC.N ), formed last year from the merger of US Airways and American West Airlines, on Thursday posted a net loss for the third quarter after fuel hedging and merger-related costs. 

 The airline said the loss amounted to $78 million, or 88 cents per share, compared with a loss of $99 million, or $5.74 per share, for American West a year earlier. For accounting purposes, America West was treated as the acquiring company. Excluding special items, US Air said it earned $101 million, or $1.09 per share. Items included an $88 million charge to reduce the book value of some outstanding fuel hedges and $27 million in merger-related costs. The merger was completed in September 2005. US Air posted revenue of $2.97 billion, compared with $929 million a year earlier. Chief Executive Doug Parker said in a statement that airport security regulations cost the carrier between $30 million and $40 million in revenue during August and September. The carrier ended the quarter with $3 billion in cash and investments, of which $2.3 billion was unrestricted.
