 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Three ratings agencies said on Wednesday they may cut their ratings on Clear Channel Communications Inc. ( CCU.N ) into junk territory, citing the company's statement that it is exploring alternatives to raise its share price, including a possible leveraged buyout. 

 Standard & Poors and Fitch Ratings both rate Clear Channel's senior unsecured debt "BBB-minus," and Moody's Investors Service rates the debt "Baa3," and all are their lowest investment grade rankings. Private equity groups Providence Equity Partners, Blackstone and KKR are in advanced talks to buy Clear Channel, the largest U.S. radio company, a source familiar with the situation said on Wednesday.  Clear Channel, which operates more than 1,200 radio stations, earlier on Wednesday responded to reports that it was considering offers to be taken private by saying it had hired Goldman Sachs & Co. ( GS.N ) to help it evaluate strategic alternatives. The company said a deal was not certain. "Because of the potential size of the buyout, Standard & Poor's expects the equity contribution to be small, resulting in significant levels of additional debt," S&P said in a statement. S&P noted that the company's statement comes after a number of shareholder-favoring initiatives, including a $1 billion stock repurchase authorization announced in early September. "While there are numerous possible outcomes from this announcement, Fitch believes that on balance there is a higher likelihood of a negative outcome for bondholders," Fitch said in a statement. Clear Channel's 6.25 percent bond due 2011 widened 48 basis points on Thursday to 2.18 percentage points over Treasuries, according to MarketAxess.
