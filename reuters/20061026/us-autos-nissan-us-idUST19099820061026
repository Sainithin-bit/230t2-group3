 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. ( 7201.T ) said on Thursday its U.S. auto sales for October were on track to post a double-digit rise. 

 "Knowing the performance for the first 25 days, I can tell you that we are on track for double-digit sales growth," Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn told a news conference. After straining to meet a 3.6 million vehicle global sales target for the 12 months through September 2005, Nissan has paid with a year-long sales slump, exacerbated by a paucity of new models. Its sole first-half launch was a commercial truck. Nissan's U.S. September sales fell 9 percent year-on-year.
