 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Health insurer Aetna Inc. ( AET.N ) on Thursday posted higher quarterly profit as it said medical cost trends moderated and enrollment grew. 

 Net income at the Hartford, Connecticut-based company rose to $476 million, or 85 cents per share, from $373 million, or 62 cents per share, a year earlier. Aetna shares have fallen about 18 percent this year, more than most health-insurance peers, as its quarterly results earlier this year disappointed investors. The stock changes hands at about 12.5 times next year's earnings estimates, less than for rivals UnitedHealth Group Inc. ( UNH.N ) and WellPoint Inc. ( WLP.N )
