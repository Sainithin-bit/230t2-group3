 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The White House said on Friday that while the government's report on a lower jobless rate in November showed the U.S. economy was healing, the world economy remained in a "fragile state." 
 "All economies are linked through trade and finance," top White House economic adviser Alan Krueger said in a statement issued after the Labor Department said U.S. unemployment had dropped to 8.6 percent last month. (Reporting by  Matt Spetalnick  and  Jeff Mason )
