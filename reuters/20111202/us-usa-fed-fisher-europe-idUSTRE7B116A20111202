 DALLAS  (Reuters) - The United States is headed the way of debt crisis-wracked Italy and Greece unless U.S. leaders make a more concerted effort to fix the national deficit, a top Federal Reserve official said Friday. 
 Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher told a meeting of business leaders they should take the Occupy Wall Street movement "seriously" because too many people are out of work. He urged them to lobby lawmakers to craft a fiscal solution to the nation's debt problem, which is creating uncertainty and holding back business investment. Otherwise, social unrest could result, Fisher said. (Reporting by  Ann Saphir ; editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)
