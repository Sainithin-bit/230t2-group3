 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Senate Agriculture Committee will meet next week to vote on whether to subpoena former MF Global CEO Jon Corzine, if he and other company officials do not agree to appear before the panel on December 13. 
 Agriculture Committee Chair Debbie Stabenow said in a statement on Friday that the committee has yet to hear from Corzine on whether he will voluntarily appear before her committee. (Reporting by  Alexandra Alper )
