 LONDON  (Reuters) - Miner Xstrata Plc XTA.L beat forecasts by more than doubling its 2006 adjusted profit and said strong demand from China and India, coupled with tight supplies, would keep metal prices high, boosting its shares. 


 The Swiss-based firm, 36-percent owned by commodities giant Glencore GLEN.UL, also said on Tuesday it was benefiting from three big acquisitions it made in 2006, and that it would continue to look for deals as it rapidly pays off its debt. But it declined to comment on press speculation it could get involved in a possible break-up of bigger rival Anglo-American ( AAL.L ) ( AGLJ.J ). "We are alive to M&A (merger and acquisition) opportunities all the time," Chief Executive Mick Davis told Reuters. London-listed Xstrata said it made net profit of $4.89 billion in 2006, accounting for three recent acquisitions as if they had been part of the group since the start of the year. Analysts had forecast adjusted profit of $4.6 billion, according to the average of a company poll. Xstrata made three big acquisitions in 2006 -- one third of Colombia's Cerrejon coal operation, Peru's Tintaya copper mine and, the biggest, Canadian miner Falconbridge. "Overall a solid result, highlighting the potential for strong earnings growth in 2007," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a research note, keeping a "buy" rating on the stock. At 1000 GMT, Xstrata shares were up 3.5 percent at 2,412 pence, one of the biggest rises on the UK's FTSE-100  .FTSE  index, valuing the firm at 22.8 billion pounds ($43.8 billion). Xstrata has been benefiting from a boom in demand for metals, with copper prices MCU3 surging around 40 percent in 2006 and nickel MNI3 soaring around 250 percent. But its shares have underperformed the DJ Stoxx basic resources index .SXPP by about 10 percent this year, as prices for some of its metals, such as copper, have slipped back. "While it is unlikely that average prices for base metals will continue to rise at a similar rate in 2007, the fundamental outlook for the industry remains positive," Xstrata said. "The rapidly industrializing economies of China and India and the satisfactorily performing economies of the older "Asian tigers" and Europe will continue to drive demand growth for metals and energy, despite an underperforming U.S. economy." RAPID EXPANSION From a small Swiss-domiciled producer of steel alloys known as Sudelektra Holding AG in the late 1990s, Xstrata has grown rapidly to challenge the world's big three miners -- BHP Billiton ( BHP.AX ) ( BLT.L ), Rio Tinto ( RIO.AX ) ( RIO.L ) and Anglo. Its acquisition spree has left it with net debt of $13.6 billion, but Chief Financial Officer Trevor Reid said high metal prices meant the group would reduce that quickly and cut gearing -- its ratio of debt to equity -- to within its target range of 30 to 35 percent this year, from 41 percent at the end of 2006. Some analysts think Xstrata should increase its presence in bulk commodities, which are based on negotiated prices, to cut its exposure to more volatile trading exchange metals. "Do we need more bulks? I don't know. But would we look for transactions if they make sense with bulk commodities? The answer is absolutely right," Davis said in an interview. Xstrata said it would make annual savings of $545 million from its acquisition of Canada's Falconbridge. Keeping down costs is a particular focus for mining companies amid skills shortages and high prices for fuel and building materials. The group said there were signs the rate of input price increases had slowed in the second half of 2006, but that it was too early to say if this would continue this year. It added that it expects capital spending of around $1.4 billion this year. Xstrata also announced resource upgrades for its Las Bambas and Tintaya copper deposits in Peru and an expansion in concentrator capacity at its McArthur River zinc-lead mine in Australia, and said it would make a decision on the future of the aluminum business it acquired with Falconbridge in the first half of this year. Many analysts expect this to be sold. Xstrata proposed a final dividend of 30 cents a share, up 34 percent on the year before.
