 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said on Tuesday that it is offering free shipping on thousands of items purchased on its Web site for pick-up in more than 750 of its U.S. stores. 


 The program, which Wal-Mart has been testing since 2004, will be rolled out nationwide to more than 3,300 stores by late summer, and it could help bring additional sales to the retailer's stores. Mike Smith, Walmart.com's director of store integration, said the retailer found that nearly half of the customers from the trial spent an additional $60 in its stores when they went to pick up their orders. While some of that additional spending was on planned purchases, like groceries, Smith said, about half of it was spent on unplanned items. Wal-Mart has been working to reinvigorate its sales after posting a string of paltry sales gains at its U.S. stores open at least a year. It has also been trying to integrate its Web site more closely with its store base. Raul Vazquez, Walmart.com's chief executive, said shoppers were typically using the service to buy products Wal-Mart sells on its site but not in its stores. With no space limitations online, retailers often offer a wider selection of merchandise on their Web sites than in their stores. Wal-Mart, for instance, sells a larger array of flat-panel televisions on its site than it does in its stores. While Vazquez and Smith said Wal-Mart sees the program as a way to sell more items to current Wal-Mart shoppers, they said they did not see it as a way of acquiring different kinds of shoppers. "When we develop new services, it is with the Wal-Mart customer in mind," Vazquez said. Wal-Mart said the items purchased online arrive in the Wal-Mart stores within seven to 10 business days after ane order is processed. Customers receive automated e-mails when their orders are ready for pickup.
