 GENEVA  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) Chief Executive Rick Wagoner declined on Tuesday to say whether the world's largest automaker would bid for struggling rival Chrysler Group, but said the escalating costs facing the industry favored more alliances and mergers. 


 "There's nothing we want to say about it," Wagoner told reporters on the sidelines of the Geneva auto show when asked about Chrysler. But Wagoner said the costs of developing the next generation of automobiles, especially the replacement for the traditional internal combustion engine, meant that the industry would be driven toward deeper collaboration. "You're going to have to see manufacturers work together in some fashion ... It could be eventually supply agreements. It could be, I suppose, in some cases mergers, if the case is big enough," he said. For its part, GM is open to tie-ups with other automakers to develop an all-electric car like the Chevrolet Volt concept that GM unveiled in January, Wagoner said. "I think it would be a good example where you could say, yes, you could do that," he said. GM has had some success in past collaborative tie-ups and outright acquisitions, Wagoner said, citing the automaker's decision to buy the assets of failed Korean automaker Daewoo in 2002. "That's worked out great for us," he said. SALES OUTLOOK Separately, Wagoner said he thought the global auto industry was on track for its sixth consecutive record year in unit sales, with about 70 million vehicle sales in 2007, driven by growth in developing markets such as China, Russia and Brazil. When asked, Wagoner said that "should" mean GM's sales would rise beyond the 9 million units it sold in 2006, but declined to say whether that growth in unit sales would translate into record revenue. Wagoner said he expected the U.S economy to post growth near 3 percent this year, with improvement in the second half as the battered housing market stabilizes. GM is being challenged by Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ) in terms of its global sales this year and could be overtaken in the view of many analysts as the industry's top player. Wagoner said a "dramatically" undervalued yen was conferring an unfair advantage on Japanese automakers who still export heavily from home. "Think in terms of 90 to 100 (yen to the dollar) as the market base of the currency," he said. The yen has strengthened against the dollar in recent trading sessions, a trend Wagoner said could accelerate if more investors opt to unwind "yen carry trades", in which investors borrow the Japanese currency to take advantage of low yen interest rates and invest the cash elsewhere for greater returns. "It will be interesting to see ... if the Japanese government sticks to their now stated position that they don't plan on intervening in the currency markets," he said. "I'm skeptical but would love to be proven wrong." Wagoner said he believed more European automakers and governments had come around to GM's view that the Japanese currency has been "artificially weak". The dollar was trading on Tuesday at near 116.54 yen, down from a recent high above 120 yen.
