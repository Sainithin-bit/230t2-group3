 SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - Gold fell to its lowest in six weeks on Tuesday before bargain hunters resurfaced, but trading was muted after a rally in the Japanese yen and a slide in global stock markets rattled the nerves of many investors. 


 Spot gold hit an intraday low of $632.30 an ounce before rebounding to $644.40/645.50 an ounce by 0605 GMT, higher than $637.60/638.35 late in New York on Monday. "The big question remains: Is this merely a healthy correction or part of a bigger move lower?" asked Investec Australia in a daily report. "Whilst the former is looking the more likely - at the moment, investors will understandably remain nervous and volatility will remain high over the coming weeks," it said. Gold, which may find support around $630, has been hit by a surging yen and falling global stocks that forced investors to sell the metal to cover their losses. It has lost around 7 percent in value since hitting a 9-month high of $689 last Monday and was trading well below a 26-year high of $730 hit in mid-May 2006. Some dealers said gold was regaining strength, with the help of purchases from bargain hunters, jewellers and investors. "We will find bargain hunters starting to come back again. We tried another downside this morning but then the market recovered a little bit," said a dealer in Singapore. "I would say fundamentals are OK. Dehedging by big miners is supposed to continue and they will take the opportunity to buy back," said the dealer, who pegged immediate support at $635. Mining companies have increasingly reduced hedges to take advantage of rising bullion prices. In Japan, benchmark gold futures for February delivery on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange rose 9 yen per gram to 2,441 yen, having hit a low of 2,378 yen. The dollar rebounded from a three-month low against the yen, with a recovery in Tokyo shares helping curb a week-long sell-off in risky assets exacerbated by the Japanese currency's rally. The Nikkei stock average closed 1.22 percent higher, snapping a five-day losing streak and providing some hope for investors that the worst of the pull-back from equities may be over. The dollar rose more than one yen from intraday lows and was at 116.45 yen up about 0.7 percent from late U.S. trade. Other precious metals rebounded, with platinum trading above a 1-month low hit on Monday. "The important thing to take home now is how attractive gold and platinum remain as assets and this is very much a time to accumulate rather than commiserate," said Nick Moore, commodities analyst at ABN AMRO. "We were at $686 a week ago. There is nothing to say that gold won't be back at those numbers in another week. People need to get accustomed to huge volatility," he said. Silver edged up to $12.86/12.91 an ounce from $12.64/12.69 late in New York. It had fallen to $12.38 an ounce on Monday, its lowest since mid-January. Platinum rose to $1,191/1,196 an ounce from $1,168/1,173 an ounce in New York on Monday, when it had dropped to a one-month low of $1,159. Palladium rose to $340/345 from $335/340 an ounce.
