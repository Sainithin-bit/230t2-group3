 LONDON  (Reuters) - Shares on Wall Street are expected to open higher on Tuesday, taking a cue from a strong performance in European and Asian markets, while bid talk takes the top slot in a thin day for company events. 


 TRW Automotive Holdings ( TRW.N ) will be eyed after the Financial Times reported the U.S. company is thinking about making a bid for the automotive engineering unit of Germany's Siemens. Among other M&A news, K&F Industries ( KFI.N ) is in focus after British aerospace firm Meggitt Plc ( MGGT.L ) announced an agreed takeover of the U.S. firm worth $1.8 billion including debt. K&F said the deal involved a cash offer at $27 per share, versus a Monday close of $24.50, valuing its equity at $1.1 billion. Markets will track U.S. revised productivity and labor costs, due at 1330 GMT, followed by factory orders at 1500 GMT. By 1050 GMT, Dow DJc1 and Nasdaq futures NDc1 were both up 0.9 percent, while S&P futures SPc1 rose 1 percent. European markets were higher, snapping a five-day losing run, while Asian markets ended with gains. Global equities are still licking their wounds after a sudden and sharp sell-off last week. U.S. stocks slid on Monday as a worldwide flight from riskier assets moved into a second week, fed in part by heightened concerns about the flagging health of the subprime mortgage market. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  lost 0.3 percent to end at 12,050.4, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  declined 0.9 percent to 1,374.1 and the Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  shed 1.15 percent to 2,340.7. The yen slipped against the dollar and euro on Tuesday while higher-yielding currencies rebounded as rising equities helped stem a week-long sell-off in risky carry trades. Over the past week investors have rushed to unwind these trades, funded in the low-yielding yen or Swiss franc, as a decline in global stocks and concerns about the U.S. economy fanned investor risk aversion. Among other corporate news, McAfee Inc. MFE.N named high-tech industry veteran Dave DeWalt to take over as chief executive as the security software maker faces a stock-options accounting scandal and pressure to find new growth. DeWalt, the former chief executive of Nasdaq-listed Documentum Inc., a maker of document storage software, joined EMC Corp. ( EMC.N ) in 2003, when the data storage supplier embarked on a major expansion into the software market. On the M&A front, Citigroup ( C.N ) launched a $10.75 billion takeover bid for scandal-hit Japanese brokerage Nikko Cordial Corp. 8603.T in a deal designed to transform its business in the world's second-biggest economy.
