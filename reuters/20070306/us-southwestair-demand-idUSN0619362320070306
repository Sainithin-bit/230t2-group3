 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Southwest Airlines Co. ( LUV.N ) on Tuesday said demand for air travel was soft last month and the trend would continue in March, suggesting first-quarter earnings may be weaker than expected. 


 "We interpret this as a warning as to the unachievability of first-quarter consensus," JP Morgan analyst Jamie Baker said in a note. He lowered his estimate for Southwest's first-quarter earnings to 6 cents a share from 8 cents a share. Analysts, on average, are forecasting earnings of 9 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Southwest, the leading U.S. discount carrier, said load factor -- the percentage of airplane seats filled with paying passengers -- fell 1.7 points to 66.8 percent in February, because of weaker demand related to harsh winter weather in the U.S. Northeast and Midwest. The softness has persisted. "Bookings for March are a little soft, suggesting our March 2007 load factor may fall below last year's record," Chief Executive Gary Kelly said in a statement. JP Morgan's Baker said the weakness was a reflection of poor forecasting by Southwest rather than a sign of a broader drop-off in demand. "We see little to suggest Southwest's warnings will spill over to other discount carrier(s)," he said. Southwest has one of the lowest load factors in the industry. American Airlines AMR.N, for instance, had a February load factor of 76.5 percent, up 1.5 points from the same month last year. But there are signs that demand is weakening. Delta Air Lines DALRQ.PK, Northwest Airlines NWACQ.PK, Alaska Airlines ( ALK.N ), and AirTran Airways AAI.N all posted declines in February load factors. High load factors help airlines by allowing them to spread flight costs over more passengers. Packed planes also give airlines leeway to raise fares.
