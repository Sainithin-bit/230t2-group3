 GENEVA  (Reuters) - Representatives from Cerberus Capital Management CBS.UL met executives from Chrysler Group on Monday to consider a possible bid for the struggling automaker, the Detroit News reported on Tuesday. 


 The newspaper, citing unnamed people close to the situation, said representatives of a second private equity fund, The Blackstone Group BG.UL, would meet with Chrysler management later this week. Dieter Zetsche, chief executive of DaimlerChrysler AG DCXGn.DE, declined to comment on Tuesday when asked by reporters at the Geneva auto show about the potential sale of its Chrysler unit, which represents the Jeep, Dodge and Chrysler brands. Representatives of Cerberus and Blackstone could not be immediately reached for comment. Zetsche said on February 14 that the German company was keeping all options open for Chrysler, which lost $1.48 billion last year as sales slumped and inventories rose. Chrysler has announced plans to cut a total of 13,000 jobs, or about 16 percent of its workforce, in a bid to return to profitability by 2008. In addition to private equity firms, Chrysler has attracted interest from General Motors Corp ( GM.N ), according to people familiar with the bidding process.
