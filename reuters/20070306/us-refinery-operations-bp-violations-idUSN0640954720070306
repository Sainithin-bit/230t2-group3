 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - BP Plc ( BP.L ) said on Tuesday it was working toward settling outstanding safety and health violations at two of its Midwestern refineries. 


 In Ohio, the company said it had reached an agreement in principle with federal regulators on violations at its 160,000 barrel per day refinery in Toledo. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration had inspected the refinery in the wake of the March 2005 blast at BP's Texas City, Texas, refinery which killed 15 people and injured 170 others As a result of its investigation of the Texas City refinery, OSHA conducted an inspection of BP Products North America Inc.'s Toledo refinery, beginning in October 2005. On April 24, 2006, OSHA issued citations with a total penalty of $2.4 million, alleging 39 separate violations of two different OSHA standards at the refinery. In its regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, BP said it had reached a settlement in principle with OSHA and was working toward finalizing the documentation. BP also faces violations issued by the Indiana Occupational Safety and Health Administration (IOSHA) for conditions at its 420,000 barrel per day Whiting refinery. The refinery, the fifth-largest in the continental United States, was served three notices in November 2006 about 14 separate violations of the OSHA regulations. The total proposed penalty was $0.4 million. On December 7, 2006, BP and IOSHA met to discuss resolution of the matter. Discussions to reach a settlement agreement are ongoing. A company spokesman was not immediately available to comment.
