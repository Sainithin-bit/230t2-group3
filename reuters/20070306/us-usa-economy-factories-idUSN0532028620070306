 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - New orders at U.S. factories tumbled by a greater-than-expected 5.6 percent in January, the biggest decline in more than six years, on a big drop in aircraft orders, a Commerce Department report showed on Tuesday. 


 It was the biggest monthly decline in orders since an 8.6 percent decrease in July 2000, the government said. Analysts polled by Reuters were expecting orders to decline 4.3 percent. Stripping out defense goods, orders fell by 5.5 percent, the largest monthly slide on record. Transportation orders fell 19 percent on a 60.2 percent drop in civilian aircraft orders and a 58.9 percent slide in military aircraft orders. When transportation was stripped out, orders fell 2.9 percent, their largest slide since September. Durable goods orders were revised down to an 8.7 percent drop in January, the biggest drop since July 2000. Orders were down for machinery, computers and electronic products, and cars. The government's first report last week of the drop in orders for durable goods -- big ticket items meant to last three years or more -- was a factor in the sharp sell-off in stock markets around the world as investors interpreted weak orders as a sign the U.S. economy is slowing. Commerce initially published the durables orders decline as 7.8 percent. Analysts said Wednesday's report underscores concerns about economic weakness. "It is a fundamental decline," said Christopher Low, chief economist at FTN Financial in New York. "The contribution to GDP here is very weak." U.S. Treasury debt prices pared losses after the weaker-than-expected report. Stocks opened higher. Nondefense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a proxy for business spending, were off 6.3 percent, the largest decrease since January 2004. All nondefense capital goods orders plummeted 20.2 percent, the biggest drop on record. In a sign businesses are managing their stockpiles, inventories fell 0.2 percent in January, the first decline since February of 2006. Still, the inventories-to-shipments ratio, a measure of how many months it would take to exhaust stores of goods, edged up to 1.23 months' time from 1.22 in December.
