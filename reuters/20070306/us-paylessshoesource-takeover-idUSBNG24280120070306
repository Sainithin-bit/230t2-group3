 (Reuters) - Payless ShoeSource PSS.N said it plans to buy privately held Collective International LP for about $91 million to enter the brand development, management and licensing business. 


 The footwear retailer said the deal, which is expected to close in the first half of Payless' fiscal 2007, will be neutral to its fiscal 2007 net earnings and add to its fiscal 2008 net earnings. (Reporting by Rajeshwari Sharma in Bangalore)
