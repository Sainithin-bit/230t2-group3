 GENEVA  (Reuters) - DaimlerChrysler's DCXGn.DE Chrysler division expects significant sales growth outside North America this year and is holding talks with potential partners to boost its global presence, a senior official said on Tuesday. 


 "For the next month and the rest of the year significant growth is very sustainable," Thomas Hausch, head of international sales for Chrysler Group, told Reuters at the Geneva car show. Chrysler sales outside North America rose 15 percent to 207,000 units in 2006 and were up 10 percent in the first two months of this year. Chrysler is counting on foreign sales growth -- in part with allies -- to help offset its weak U.S. showing. "We are talking to a lot of people around the world and the talks are very productive," Hausch said, but he would not give any more details. He said Chrysler was taking a close look at India and Russia, where it has no local production now. Chrysler's international operations accounted for 6 percent of its overall sales in 2000, but this rose to 8 percent by 2006 and this year should reach 9 percent, Hausch said. Chrysler's business plan calls for doubling overseas sales to 400,000 units by 2012 even excluding strategic partners which it seeks under a reorganisation plan that will cut 13,000 jobs and close a plant in North America to halt losses by next year. Hausch unveiled three new models in Geneva to go on sale in Europe this year: the Chrysler Sebring convertible, Jeep Patriot and Dodge Avenger. Chrysler will have eight international model launches this year, he said.
