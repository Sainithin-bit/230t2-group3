 GENEVA  (Reuters) - BMW ( BMWG.DE ), the world's largest premium carmaker, increased group vehicle sales by 2.8 percent in February to 97,000 units worldwide, its chief executive said on Tuesday at the Geneva auto show. 


 With total deliveries up 1.6 percent in the first two months of the year to over 190,000 vehicles, Norbert Reithofer forecast group sales to customers in 2007 would surpass the 1.4 million mark as demand rises for its BMW, Mini and Rolls-Royce brands. "We intend to achieve a new retail record for each of our three brands," the BMW CEO said. The Munich-based carmaker increased vehicle sales last year by 3.5 percent to 1.37 million units.
