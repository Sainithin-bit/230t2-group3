 SEOUL  (Reuters) - Shares in LG Electronics Inc. ( 066570.KS ) rose as much as 4.7 percent on Tuesday amid market speculation its operating profit margins in mobile phones are stronger than expected so far in the current quarter. 


 The world's no.5 mobile phone maker, which relies heavily on exports, also rose as a weaker South Korean won  KRW=  currency is expected to boost returns from abroad and as investors expect a recovery in earnings at its flat panel joint venture LG.Philips LCD Co. Ltd. ( 034220.KS ) Kwon Sung-ryul, an analyst at Hyundai Securities, said his channel checks indicated LG's operating margins for mobile phones in January and February could reach more than 3 percent, above market expectations for 1-2 percent margins. "The gains today are mainly due to strong handset performance. Handset operating margins are better than market consensus," said Kwon. "We think this will be able to boost LG Electronics' total operating profit this quarter," he added. Shares in LG Electronics rose 3.68 percent to 59,200 won as of 0504 GMT, compared with a 1.7 percent gain in the main KOSPI   .KS11 . LG Electronics is relying on sales of handset models such as the Chocolate and Shine to drive earnings after it posted an unexpected operating loss in the October-December quarter due to struggling flat-screen operations. The mobile phone maker has faced tough competition against bigger players such as Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ), Motorola Inc. MOT.N and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. ( 005930.KS ). "February mobile phone exports data shows exports to the United States and Western Europe were solid," said Kevin Lee, an analyst at Woori Investment and Securities. "LG appears to have enjoyed good sales of Chocolate and Shine phones, which will help its handset sales meet expectations." Lee forecasts LG's mobile phone sales in the first quarter would reach 16.2 million units, for an operating profit margin of 2 percent. Shares in LG Electronics surged 14.4 percent in February, their first monthly gain in six months, compared with a 4.2 percent rise in the KOSPI, as investors anticipated earnings could beat expectations in the first half of the year.
