 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - CBS Corp. ( CBS.N ) said on Tuesday it was buying back about $1.4 billion of its stock in an accelerated stock repurchase plan, driving the shares up more than 4 percent. 


 CBS, which owns the highest rated U.S. television network, said the repurchase was part of a program it announced on February 27 under which it will buyback about $1.5 billion of its stock, representing about 6 percent of its outstanding shares. At that time, it also raised its dividend by 10 percent. By repurchasing $1.4 billion of its stock on Tuesday, or about 47 million shares, CBS is taking advantage of the recent, sharp drop in its stock. The shares were down about 7.5 percent from their 2007 highs before the rally on Tuesday. The shares were up $1.39 at $31.01 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
