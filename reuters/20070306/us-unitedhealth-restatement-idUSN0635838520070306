 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - UnitedHealth Group Inc. ( UNH.N ) said on Tuesday it completed an earnings restatement of up to $1.5 billion tied to its stock options accounting, sending its shares up as much as 3 percent on hopes an end to the scandal was in sight. 


 UnitedHealth, the largest U.S. health insurer by market value, filed its 10-K annual report with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday that included an earnings restatement dating back to 1994, mostly to account for errors in recording stock options grants. The restatement followed several delays in filing quarterly reports that had postponed its share buyback program and raised questions over its ability to focus on operating performance. "Most investors will be relieved to see the company done with this," Bank of American analyst Joseph France said in a research note. UnitedHealth, one of the largest companies caught in a national scandal over options manipulation, has been under pressure since its grants came under scrutiny a year ago. William McGuire, the longtime chief executive, left the company in late 2006 after its independent counsel found evidence of stock options that were incorrectly dated to take advantage of share price rises. The company still faces a formal probe by the SEC. It has been subpoenaed by federal prosecutors, while U.S. lawmakers have also requested documents over its options grants. Ongoing investigations may cause volatility in UnitedHealth shares, but a "significant overhang" has been lifted with the company becoming current in its SEC reports, J.P. Morgan analyst William Georges said in a note. In its report on Tuesday, UnitedHealth said it determined that the "company used incorrect measurement dates and made other errors ... in accounting for stock option grants." UnitedHealth found in most cases it had incorrect dates for grants involving about 80 million shares given to company officers, about 260 million shares given to middle management and senior management, and about 50 million shares in connection with hiring or promoting employees. TAX CHARGE SEEN UnitedHealth said under a former accounting method, the pretax effect of the errors from 1994 through the end of 2005 was a $1.526 billion overstatement in profit, in line with its estimate of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion issued in December. Under the company's current accounting method, the pretax effect of the errors for the period was $502 million. It previously estimated $400 million to $600 million. The company estimated it would pay about $100 million for additional corporate income taxes and also expects a one-time cash charge of $55 million, or 4 cents per share, in the first quarter for other tax liabilities. UnitedHealth said its 2006 profit rose to $4.16 billion, or $2.97 per share, from $3.08 billion, or $2.31 per share, in 2005. Prior to its SEC filing, the company had not reported per-share results or year-ago comparisons. More than 170 companies have been investigated by U.S. authorities or have conducted internal inquiries into possible manipulation of stock option grant dates. UnitedHealth shares rose 86 cents, or 1.6 percent to $53.82 on the New York Stock Exchange after rising as high as $54.43, outpacing rivals Aetna Inc. ( AET.N ) and WellPoint Inc. ( WLP.N ) The stock is still down about 5 percent in the past 12 months. (Additional reporting by  Karey Wutkowski  in Washington)
