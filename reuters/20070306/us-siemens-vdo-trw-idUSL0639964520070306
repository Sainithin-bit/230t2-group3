 LONDON  (Reuters) - TRW Automotive Holdings ( TRW.N ) is thinking about making a bid for the automotive engineering unit of Germany's Siemens, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday, citing three people involved in the bidding process. 


 The FT cited some of its sources as saying other profitable U.S. suppliers were also eyeing Siemens' ( SIEGn.DE ) VDO arm. Sources familiar with the matter told Reuters last month, however, that Siemens had invited investment banks to compete to run a planned initial public offering of VDO. Siemens declined to comment on the report and said it continued to plan its IPO. The industrial conglomerate has said it wants to list between 25 and 50 percent of VDO, which is valued around 5 billion euros ($6.6 billion), by the end of September. Tire and car-parts maker Continental ( CONG.DE ) has said it is interested in the unit, but Siemens has played down chances of a sale to Continental. Siemens shares were up 0.5 percent to 77.87 euros by 0848 GMT, broadly in line with Germany's blue-chip DAX  .GDAXI . ($1=.7615 euro)
