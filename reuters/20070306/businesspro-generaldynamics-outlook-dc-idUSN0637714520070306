 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Defense contractor General Dynamics 
Corp. ( GD.N ) could beat its 2007 earnings forecast amid robust 
demand for tanks and business jets, its chief executive said on 
Tuesday. 


  "Upside potential certainly exists, but within reason," CEO 
Nicholas Chabraja said at a Citigroup investor conference.  He reiterated the company's forecast for 2007 earnings of 
$4.60 per share on revenue of more than $26 billion.  The forecast was viewed as conservative when it was first 
issued in January, and Wall Street continues to be more 
bullish. Analysts, on average, expect earnings of $4.74 per 
share on revenue of $26.6 billion, according to Reuters 
Estimates.  General Dynamics has been concerned about the timing of 
funding for projects related to ongoing hostilities in Iraq and 
Afghanistan.  The No. 4 U.S. defense contractor, like rivals Lockheed 
Martin Corp. ( LMT.N ) and Raytheon Co. ( RTN.N ), has been 
enjoying a boom in military and commercial aircraft spending. 
General Dynamics expects the strong demand to continue into 
2008.  Chabraja said he expects the company's armored vehicle 
unit, Combat Systems, to record double-digit percentage growth 
in revenue in 2008 following 12 percent to 13 percent growth 
forecast this year.  Combat Systems, which makes the Abrams battle tank and 
Stryker combat vehicles, accounted for about 28 percent of 
General Dynamics' fourth-quarter revenue.  Business jet unit Gulfstream faces pressure to ramp up 
production in 2008 amid demand for new aircraft, Chabraja said.  He predicted growth in Gulfstream sales of 17 percent to 18 
percent this year amid higher deliveries.
