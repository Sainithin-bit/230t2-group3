 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - ServiceMaster Co. ( SVM.N ), the U.S. lawncare company that put itself up for sale last year, is drawing interest from at least two buyout groups that may bid more than $4 billion, four people with knowledge of the discussions said, according to a report on Bloomberg News. 


 Clayton, Dubilier & Rice Inc. is preparing one offer and Bain Capital LLC has formed a group with private-equity firms to make another bid, said the people, who declined to be identified because an agreement had not been reached, Bloomberg said. Final offers for the owner of TruGreen ChemLawn and Terminix pest control are due this month, the people said, Bloomberg reported.
