 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Airbus is likely to announce an order for the longer-range A330 plane on Wednesday morning at the Farnborough Airshow, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. 
 Airbus announced a makeover for its most profitable long-distance jet on Monday and said it was working on getting a new customer for the plane by the end of the show. (Reporting by  Victoria Bryan ; Editing by  Mark Potter )
