 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Troubles in the $2.4 trillion 
bond insurance industry appeared to be easing on Tuesday after 
Moody's Investors Service ended its downgrade review on MBIA 
Inc's ( MBI.N ) insurance arm, following a similar move by 
Standard & Poor's on Monday. 

 The outlook for the top "AAA" ratings of MBIA, the largest 
bond insurer, is negative by both ratings agencies, indicating 
a ratings downgrade is still possible over the next one to two 
years. The "AAA ratings of Ambac Financial Group's ABK.N 
insurance arm, the second-largest bond insurer, remain on 
review for downgrade because of uncertainty about its risk 
profile and capital plans for a new corporate structure being 
contemplated," S&P said. Moody's also continues to have Ambac on review for 
downgrade. Downgrades would be a serious blow for bond insurers, which 
need top ratings to win business, as well as for banks and 
brokers that entered credit derivatives deals with the 
insurers. Financial institutions could face an additional $70 
billion of write-downs if the insurers' ratings are cut, 
Oppenheimer & Co. has estimated. Following is a chronology of recent ratings actions on bond 
insurers and ratings still under review for possible
