 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Target Corp ( TGT.N ) reported an 8.1 percent drop in quarterly profit on Tuesday as shoppers spurned purchases of clothes in favor of necessities like food, hurting the discount retailer's margins. 

 "A more difficult economic environment and a hesitant consumer constrained our sales growth, especially in discretionary categories, and adversely affected our overall profitability," said Chairman and CEO Bob Ulrich. "As we enter 2008 it seems likely that we will continue to face a challenging economic climate at least through the first half of the year," he said. Target, the No. 2 U.S. discount retailer behind Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ), said profit fell to $1.028 billion, or $1.23 per share, for its fiscal fourth quarter ended February 2 from $1.119 billion, or $1.29 per share, a year earlier. Analysts, on average, had been expecting it to earn $1.22 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Target shares were up $1.80 or 3.4 percent to $55.05 in early afternoon New York Stock Exchange trading. "There's perhaps a sigh of relief that while the numbers are clearly soft, management is not saying anything that's more negative than what's already out there," said Matthew Kaufler, a portfolio manager at Clover Capital Management. SLUMPING SALES Target's results came a week after Wal-Mart posted a better-than-expected rise in fourth-quarter earnings as shoppers headed to its stores for cheap groceries and the retailer aggressively advertised its low prices. Target's sales had been outpacing those at Wal-Mart, as it attracted shoppers with cheap but trendy designer clothes, handbags, accessories and home decor. But its sales and earnings faltered in recent months as shoppers, worried about the weakening U.S. economy, filled their shopping carts with lower-margin food, laundry detergent and toothpaste instead of higher-margin shoes, clothes and jewelry. Target's sales rose 0.4 percent to $19.34 billion in the quarter from $19.27 billion a year before. Sales at stores open at least a year, a key retail gauge known as same-store sales, inched up 0.2 percent. Its gross margin rate fell 53 basis points compared with a year earlier. Standard & Poor's Equity Research downgraded shares of Target to "sell" from "hold" on Monday. "Amid a weakening economy, we see Target at risk of losing market share to Wal-Mart Stores, which we perceive as communicating a stronger value proposition to consumers," wrote S&P analyst Jason Asaeda in a note. DEFENDING ITS STRATEGY Despite near-term bumps, Target said on a conference call that it does not intend to change its long-term strategy. "Target is fortunate to have a powerful brand, a seasoned leadership team, and a proven strategy that has successfully navigated economic downturns in the past," Ulrich said. "We are committed to improving our recent performance without sacrificing any aspect of our brand." This year, Target will add more natural and organic beauty items and said it will still partner with designers to develop exclusive merchandise to sell in its stores. UBS analyst Neil Currie said that Target is a "hostage of the economy right now," and sticking with its longer-term strategy is the "wise thing to do." "We've always liked Target long-term, but we acknowledge that there is a high element of discretionary nature within their shopper's spend, and on that basis we think there are risks," he said. FINANCIAL FORECAST Target's Chief Financial Officer Doug Scovanner said that first-quarter earnings of 73 cents per share and full-year earnings of $3.56 per share are within a "reasonable" range of potential outcomes. Analysts, on average, are expecting first-quarter earnings of 74 cents per share and full-year earnings of $3.66, according to Reuters Estimates. Target's quarterly credit card revenue jumped almost 21 percent to $532 million from $441 million, and the retailer said it is "actively engaged" in trying to put together a transaction for its credit card business. Since last year, Target has been trying to determine whether to sell its credit card receivables. It has said it will announce a decision on possible alternative ownership structures for the business, which includes the Target Visa Card and Target Credit Card, in the first calendar quarter of 2008.
