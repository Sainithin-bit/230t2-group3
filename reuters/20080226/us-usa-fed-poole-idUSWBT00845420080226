 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President William Poole said on Tuesday that financial markets were moving back to more-normal functioning but had "not healed" yet. 

 "The markets are not healed, but I believe a lot of progress has been made," Poole said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. "You see a lot of the spreads narrowing, for example, the term Libor is more or less back to normal." "A lot of banks and others are raising capital. We see the monoline insurance industry raising capital, getting things straightened out there. It's coming along," said Poole, who is retiring from the central bank and will not attend the Fed's next policy-setting meeting on March 18.
