 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Contract talks between American Axle & Manufacturing Holdings Inc. ( AXL.N ) and the United Auto Workers were stalled with hours remaining on the union's contract, and local bargaining units were preparing to strike, union officials briefed on the talks said on Monday. 

 Talks between the two sides have snagged on the union's proposal to create a "wage bridge" that would allow lower-paid new hires to earn more with eventual seniority, and on the Detroit-based company's proposals to shutter facilities, said the officials, who asked not to be named. Analysts have said a prolonged UAW strike against American Axle could disrupt production of trucks and sport utility vehicles by General Motors Corp ( GM.N ), which ranks as the supplier's largest customer. The UAW's current contract covering more than 3,000 union-represented workers in Michigan and New York expires at midnight Eastern Time (0500 GMT).
