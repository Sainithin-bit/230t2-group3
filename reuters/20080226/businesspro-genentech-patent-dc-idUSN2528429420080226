 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Genentech Inc DNA.N said on Monday 
the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has rejected the validity 
of a key patent that governs the biotechnology company's method 
of producing some of its drugs. 

  Genentech, which also receives revenue under licensing 
agreements covering other companies' medicines that utilize the 
technology, said it would file a response to the action and, if 
necessary, appeal the decision to the Board of Appeals within 
the Patent Office.  The company said the patent, known as the Cabilly patent, 
remains valid and enforceable through the appeals process, 
which it anticipates could take one to two years, or longer.  The patent involves the method of producing antibodies and 
antibody fragments, a crucial step in the manufacture of 
biotechnology drugs.  The patent had been challenged by MedImmune, which has 
since been acquired by AstraZeneca ( AZN.L ).  The patent was awarded in 2001 even though the discoveries 
on which it was based were made in the 1980s. If not revoked, 
the patent would run until 2018.  Companies that pay royalties to Genentech based on the 
patent include Abbott Laboratories Inc ( ABT.N ) and Johnson & 
Johnson ( JNJ.N ), for their widely used rheumatoid arthritis 
medicines, Humira and Remicade, and ImClone Systems Inc 
IMCL.O for its Erbitux cancer drug.  If the patent is ultimately found to be invalid, it could 
amount to substantial savings for companies now paying 
royalties.  (Reporting by  Bill Berkrot ; Editing by  Braden Reddall )
