 LONDON  (Reuters) - Standard Chartered ( STAN.L ) sees opportunities for further acquisitions to boost growth, but Chief Executive Peter Sands said on Tuesday it was too soon to tell what the impact of market turmoil would be on 2008 deals. 

 "The thrust of our strategy is organic growth, but we are constantly on the lookout for acquisitions that complement organic growth," Sands told reporters on a conference call after the Asia-focused bank's 2007 results. "It's difficult to tell what the impact of the market turmoil will be on the outlook for acquisitions in 2008, but we see a combination of both challenges and opportunities." Sands said the group's recent acquisitions had focused on adding products and capabilities, rather than new markets, and said that would continue.
