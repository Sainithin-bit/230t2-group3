 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Department store operator Macy's Inc ( M.N ) posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday as gross margin improved, sending its shares up 6 percent. 

 Investors took heart in Macy's profit, despite sales that languished in the quarter, as shoppers continued to hold on to their spare dollars and cut their trips to malls. The operator of its namesake and Bloomingdale's chains has struggled to boost sales in recent months at former May Department Stores, which it bought in 2005 and converted to the Macy's name. U.S. shoppers have added to its trouble in the period -- hard-pressed for cash in a shaky economic environment, they have become more bargain conscious and reserved their spare dollars for pricier everyday items such as food and fuel instead. The cutback has affected several U.S. department store operators. For instance, J.C. Penney Co Inc ( JCP.N ) posted a drop last week in quarterly profit and sales and said it did not see any indication the consumer environment would improve in 2008. Macy's Chief Financial Officer Karen Hoguet noted on a conference call that 2008 would be a challenging year for retailers. Still, Stephanie Hoff, a senior retail analyst at Edward Jones, said she was pretty bullish on Macy's overall. "While the consumer spending environment is weak right now, I think Macy's is taking prudent strategies and trying to grow the business," she said. EARNINGS Macy's profit rose 2.3 percent to $750 million, or $1.73 a share in its fiscal fourth quarter ended February 2, compared with $733 million, or $1.40 a share, a year earlier. Integration costs were 10 cents per share and a non-cash tax credit came to 18 cents a share in the quarter. Excluding those items, Macy's earned $1.65, topping analysts' average expectation of $1.60 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Gross margin was up at 41.6 percent from 40.8 percent. "While most department store operators have posted upside via tighter SG&A (selling, general and administrative) this earnings season (mostly due to lower compensation costs) (Macy's) beat on gross margin is a standout," Goldman Sachs analyst Adrianne Shapira said in a note. Sales fell 6.2 percent to $8.6 billion. Same-store sales, which track sales at stores open at least one full fiscal year, fell 2 percent in the quarter. Hoguet said inventory was down 5 percent compared with a year ago and "in good shape" for 2008. Earlier this month, Macy's said it would close several regional division headquarters and cut about 2,300 jobs and in December, said it would close nine underperforming stores in markets such as Indiana, Louisiana and Texas. The restructuring is expected to reduce its expenses while also reviving its sales. LOOKING FORWARD Macy's said it will no longer report sales on a monthly basis, effective with 2008. It will also not give quarterly sales or earnings outlook. "Due to calendar and promotional shifts, we have found monthly sales to cause undue confusion," Hoguet said, adding that Macy's believed its performance was better evaluated on a quarterly basis. As announced with its restructuring plans, Macy's expects to earn $1.85 to $2.15 a share, excluding one-time costs for fiscal 2008. It expects same-store sales in the range of down 1 percent to up 1.5 percent for the year. The company said it became more concerned about consumer spending in January and same-stores sales in the first half of the year, particularly the first quarter, could be below the low end of its guidance. Despite a challenging economic environment, Macy's could appeal to shoppers if it made sure its merchandise was "edited enough," Hoguet said. The company does not intend to repurchase more stock until current sales trends improve. Macy's shares were up 6.6 percent at $26.40 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
