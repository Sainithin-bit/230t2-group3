 DETROIT  (Reuters) - American Axle & Manufacturing ( AXL.N ) on Tuesday said that without sweeping concessions from its striking union work force its ability to maintain U.S. production would be in "immediate jeopardy". 

 Over 3,000 American Axle workers represented by the United Auto Workers union walked out on strike against the auto parts supplier on Tuesday. In a statement, the Detroit-based company said the union had "singled out" the supplier by refusing to allow it to cut hourly labor costs that are three times higher than its rivals at over $70 per hour. The company said it had invested over $3 billion in its U.S. facilities since its founding in 1994 as a spin-off from General Motors Corp.( GM.N ) "Without the necessary structural changes, (American Axle's) ability to compete for future business or retain existing business at these locations is in immediate jeopardy," the company said in a statement.
