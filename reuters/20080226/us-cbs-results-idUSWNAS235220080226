 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - CBS Corp ( CBS.N ) said on Tuesday quarterly profit fell about 15 percent, as sales of radio and TV stations undercut those businesses and its publishing division suffered from fewer hot book titles. 

 CBS results still surpassed expectations, however, when the shedding of those stations and other one-time events are taken into account, as the media company reported an adjusted share of 54 cents against analyst expectations of 52 cents for the fourth quarter. The media company's quarterly results follow the settlement of a three-month strike by Hollywood screenwriters against film and TV studios, and come as most major networks are suffering from a steady decline in viewership for prime-time. The Writers Guild of America (WGA) strike created further turmoil, interrupting scheduling and threatening to disrupt advertising sales for the 2008-09 season. "In television, I'm particularly pleased with the recent resolution of the WGA strike, which has restored stability to the network season," Chief Executive Leslie Moonves said in a statement. More than the strike, CBS results appeared to be hurt by television and radio station divestitures, the loss of some outdoor advertising contracts, and record political advertising sales in the prior year's quarter. Net profit fell to $286.2 million, or 42 cents a share, from $335 million, or 43 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. Revenue slipped more than 3 percent to $3.76 billion. Analysts, on average, had expected revenue of $3.73 billion for the quarter, according to Reuters Estimates. TV division revenue for the fourth quarter dropped 4 percent to $2.46 billion. Radio revenue fell 10 percent. Publishing revenue also dropped, slipping 4 percent from a quarter a year ago when the company had hit books like "Lisey's Story" by Stephen King. Overall, operating income before depreciation and amortization, or OIBDA, a key financial measure for media companies, rose 4 percent. CBS forecast OIBDA and operating income growth to be in the range of 3 percent to 5 percent for 2008, excluding stock-based compensation expense.
