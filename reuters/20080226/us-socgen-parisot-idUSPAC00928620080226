 PARIS  (Reuters) - France's top business lobby said on Tuesday it was up to the board of Societe Generale ( SOGN.PA ) to decide the fate of its managers, after President Nicolas Sarkozy appeared to call for executive chairman Daniel Bouton to resign over a trading scandal. 

 "In an extremely serious crisis like the one at Societe Generale, only board members have all the information needed to judge the situation and take the right decisions," Laurence Parisot, head of employers' lobby MEDEF, said. "Is the general of an army responsible for an extortion carried out by a soldier whose name he does not even know?" "The general is above all the one responsible for taking the best decision when faced with a major accident. Only the members of the SocGen board are in a position to say if they have the best general or not -- it is certainly not up to politicians to say," she told Europe 1 radio. Parisot's comments came after Sarkozy told Le Parisien newspaper in an interview published on Tuesday that it was wrong for SocGen Chairman Daniel Bouton to sidestep his responsibility over the bank's recent trading scandal. Parisot added that politicians should not place themselves above the members of a company's boardroom. Bouton offered to resign over the 4.9 billion euros ($7.25 billion) of trading losses disclosed last month but the board rejected this and Bouton said this week his offer was off the table.
