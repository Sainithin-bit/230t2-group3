 SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wall Street analysts 
raced to outdo one another on Friday in raising stock price 
targets on Google Inc. ( GOOG.O ), with the most aggressive 
saying $600 does not look extreme for the Internet market 
leader. 

  Brokers were responding to quarterly results on Thursday 
that showed Google revenue rising 70 percent -- two to three 
times faster growth than rivals like Yahoo Inc. ( YHOO.O ) -- as 
the company tightened its grip on the Web search market.  Shares of Google closed up 7.9 percent to $459.67 on Nasdaq 
Friday, with analysts saying the stock could hit $500 in short 
order.  Citigroup raised its price target to $600 from $550, or 40 
times the broker's 2008 earnings estimate on Google of $15.12 
per share. Others boosting targets included Goldman, 
Prudential, Merrill, UBS, WR Hambrecht, and Stifel Nicolaus.  "We are raising our (price target) to $500 and think the 
stock will get there soon," UBS analyst Ben Schachter said in a 
note to clients. "It may even trade above those levels by the 
end of the year," he said, while advising caution above $500.  The rush to justify higher price targets on Google marks a 
vindication for Google's most bullish analyst, Safa Rashtchy of 
Piper Jaffray, who had set a $600 target on January 2, only to 
see the stock plummet to levels as low as $330 in March.  "$600 certainly feels a lot closer and more real now," 
Rashtchy told Reuters. "I never thought it was totally out of 
the question. It was just a matter of time."  Rashtchy's aggressive target was held out for ridicule by 
Internet bears who saw a new era of dot-com excess in the 
making -- recalling the late 1990s when analysts predicted 
eye-popping prices of $400 and even $1,000 for hot stocks. Even 
a friend of his joked: "$600 was the kiss of death for you."
  NEW AD MARKETS  Internet stocks suffered a general exodus of funds earlier 
this year that pushed the sector down as much as 20 percent.  While concerns about slowing growth and greater competition 
in the sector remain, Google's standout results means money 
managers may bypass struggling Yahoo in favor of Google through 
the end of 2006 and into early 2007, Rashtchy argues.  "Now they will come back and when they come back they will 
put more of their dollars on Google," he said.  Google's cheerleaders say they are wowed by strong revenue 
and heady profit growth, which comes despite heavy investments 
in hiring and capital equipment. The company is making more 
money from text advertisements and appears poised to expand 
into a variety of new ad markets including video.  Goldman Sachs analyst Anthony Noto told clients that 
Google's view that "Business is very...good" should be 
considered a major understatement. He reiterated a $525 
end-2006 target and set a new 12-month-out target of $595.  Ahead of Thursday's results, the consensus target on Google 
shares was for $499.20 among 25 financial analysts surveyed by 
Reuters Estimates. Following the company's strong third-quarter 
financial report, the consensus target moved up to $520.24.  Some analysts said institutional investors, more careful 
now after the heady 1990s, tend to ignore the attention paid by 
the media and retail investors to such figures. In reality, an 
investor who buys 100 shares of a $45 stock is paying no more 
for 10 shares of Google at $450.  "The sophisticated investor is not paying attention to 
that. I'm sure a lot would like to see it go to $600 but some 
sellside analyst's price target does not embolden that," said 
Peter Boockvar, equity strategist with Miller Tabak & Co.  "$600 is just a price," agreed Rashtchy. "Think about it as 
$60. If Google was at $45 and we said $60 nobody would have 
blinked an eye," he said.  (Additional reporting by  Chris Sanders  in New York)
