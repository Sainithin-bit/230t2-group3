 DUBLIN  (Reuters) - The interest rate on bailout funds for Ireland negotiated with the IMF, EU and European Central Bank is likely to be between 6 and 7 percent, much higher than expected, state broadcaster RTE said on Friday. 

 Details of the bailout, expected to total about 85 billion euros ($112.7 billion), are expected to be announced before markets reopen on Monday. An RTE correspondent said, "6.7 percent seems to be the average rate they are setting on. It is much higher than people were expecting." The correspondent said some sources had said the rate would be 6.4 percent but several had said 6.7. The money would be repaid over nine years, with Ireland's total interest payments costing 8.5 billion euros a year, or 20 percent of government revenue, RTE said. The main opposition Fine Gael party said any rate over 6 percent would be unacceptable. "If that is the rate, that is too high," Fine Gael spokesman Leo Varadkar told RTE. "It is higher than the IMF rate, it is higher than Greeks are paying." Greece agreed a bailout earlier this year. Officials at the Irish Finance Ministry were not immediately available for comment.
