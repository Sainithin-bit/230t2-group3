 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - An 85 billion euro rescue package for Ireland from the European Union and International Monetary Fund is very likely to be announced on Sunday and backed in a teleconference by EU finance ministers, euro zone sources said. 

 "It is quite likely that the deal will be announced on Sunday," one euro zone source, with insight into the negotiations with Ireland, said on Friday. A second source also pointed to Sunday as most likely for the announcement. Out of the 85 billion euros that Ireland would get, some 35 billion would be to support the ailing Irish financial sector and 50 billion euros would support the government's fiscal needs, another euro zone source said. The exact division of the total amount of aid between the various lending agents -- the European Financial Stability Mechanism, the European Financial Stability Facility and the IMF, is likely to be left to the finance ministers to decide. "Something in the region of 20 billion would be the IMF's share," the first euro zone source said. (Reporting by  Jan Strupczewski , editing by Rex Merrifield)
