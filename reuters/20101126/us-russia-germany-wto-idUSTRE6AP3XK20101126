 BERLIN  (Reuters) - Russia may be able to join the World Trade Organization as soon as next year, completing over a decade and a half of membership negotiations, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said on Friday. 

 "Regarding our possible accession to the WTO in 2011, I think this is possible, and we would like this to happen," he said at a joint press conference with Chancellor Angela Merkel. "On the whole, there are no uncoordinated issues left." (Reporting by  Gleb Bryanski ; Writing by Toni Vorobyova; editing by  Guy Faulconbridge )
