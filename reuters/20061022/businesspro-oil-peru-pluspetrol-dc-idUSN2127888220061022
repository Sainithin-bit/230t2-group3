 LIMA, Peru  (Reuters) - Argentine oil company Pluspetrol 
said on Saturday it was losing about $2.4 million a day in 
revenue after suspending operations this week because hundreds 
of indigenous protesters occupied its oil wells. 

  Pluspetrol has said some of its workers were being held 
hostage at its oil fields in the Amazon region of northern Peru 
by the protesters, who say the company is damaging the 
environment.  The government is mediating between the company and the 
Achuar Indian community to try to bring an end to the protest, 
which began more than two weeks ago, but talks continued on 
Saturday without coming to a resolution.  "At this moment we have stopped producing some 40,000 
barrels per day, at $58 or $60 per barrel, that means lost 
sales of $2.4 million a day approximately," Roberto Ramallo, 
general manager of Pluspetrol Norte, told Reuters.  The government had said on Friday it expected the protest 
would end on Saturday but Ramallo said armed indigenous groups 
remained at the company's oil fields.  "Tomorrow (Sunday) at midday we should have an agreement, 
or failed talks," he said.  Ramallo said protesters had freed some small wells, which 
meant the company had recovered some production. Earlier in the 
week Pluspetrol said it was losing 50,000 barrels per day of 
production.  The energy and mines ministry says that half of Peru's 
national crude production has been affected by the protests.
