 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Obama administration is considering closing tax breaks for oil and gas companies to help pay for a $50 billion infrastructure revamp plan, an administration official said on Monday. 

 "One of the possible things we will explore is close tax breaks for oil and gas companies as an option," the official said, when asked how the  administration would pay the program, which President Barack Obama is to announce in Milwaukee on Monday.
