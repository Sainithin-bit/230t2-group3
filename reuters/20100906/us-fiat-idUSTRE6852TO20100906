 MILAN  (Reuters) - Italian car maker Fiat SpA ( FIA.MI ) will hire Toyota Motor Europe's ( 7203.T ) Andrea Formica to head sales at its four-brand automotive group, Automotive News Europe said, citing sources familiar with the matter. 

 Formica will succeed Lorenzo Sistino, who took charge of sales at the Alfa Romeo, Lancia, Fiat car and Fiat light commercial vehicle brands in January 2009, Automotive News said on Monday. Sistino will remain with Fiat but it is not clear if he will keep his CEO jobs at Fiat's car and light commercial vehicle brands, it added. A Fiat spokesman declined to comment on the report. Formica's hiring is part of a major management overhaul Fiat Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne is expected to announce later this month, Automotive News said, citing the sources.
