 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - The European Central Bank will not discuss its exit from unlimited liquidity provision before December, the central bank's Governing Council member Ewald Nowotny was quoted as saying on Monday. 

 "We certainly won't discuss the first quarter before December of this year," Nowotny told Bloomberg News in an interview. "It's certainly too early to take a clear position." Nowotny's comments are similar to those of Axel Weber, who said last month it would be wise to keep the unlimited liquidity operations in place into next year. The ECB decided on Thursday to extend its liquidity safety net for banks until at least January 18. Nowotny was also quoted as saying the ECB would continue to phase out its crisis measures as soon as market conditions permitted it do so. "The current rate levels are extraordinarily low over the longer term, which means that we'll certainly start a normalization process as soon as possible, starting on the liquidity-provision side," he said. Nowotny also told Bloomberg there is a chance that the euro zone would experience a long period of low growth and low inflation. (Reporting by  Sakari Suoninen ; Editing by Ron Askew)
