 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Housing market is likely to remain weak and may take a generation or more to rebound, Yale economics professor Robert Shiller told Reuters Insider on Tuesday. 
 Shiller, the co-creator of the Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller home price index, said a weak labor market, high gas prices and a general sense of unease among consumers was outweighing low mortgage rates and would likely keep a lid on prices for the foreseeable future. "I worry that we might not see a really major turnaround in our lifetimes," Shiller said. The S&P/Case-Shiller composite index of 20 metropolitan areas gained 0.2 percent in February on a seasonally adjusted basis, the first uptick in prices in 10 months. But Shiller called it "a very mixed bag." Nine of the 20 cities recorded falling or flat prices on the month. He said suburban areas in particular might endure further price declines as high gas prices increase demand for "walkable cities." (Reporting by  Steven C. Johnson ; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
