 (Reuters) - General Motors' deal to sell its Swedish Saab unit has fallen apart, after niche luxury carmaker Koenigsegg, which was due to buy the loss-making business, withdrew from talks, Koenigsegg confirmed on Tuesday. 

 GM's board will meet next Tuesday to consider Saab's fate, a person familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. Below are some key facts about Saab Automobile: * Headquarters: Trollhattan, southwest Sweden. * Financials: Saab has not made a profit since 2001. In its first court filing in February Saab estimated its 2008 loss at 3 billion Swedish crowns ($392 million) and said it expected a similar result for 2009. The company hopes to reach profitability around 2011. -- In 2007, Saab made an operating loss of 2.19 billion Swedish crowns, according to the Swedish Companies Registration Office. * Employees: around 3,400 on May 18, 2009. * Sales: 93,295 vehicles globally in 2008, or 1.1 percent of total GM sales volume, down 25 percent from 2007. * History: Saab has made cars in Trollhattan since 1949. GM bought 50 percent of the firm in 1989 when Saab Automobile was established as an independent company. GM bought the rest of Saab Automobile in January 2000. * Products: Saab's 9-5 and 9-3 models are built in Trollhattan. The 9-3 Cabriolet is made by Magna Steyr in Graz, Austria. There are also plans for new 9-5 and 9-3 models and a 9-4 sports utility vehicle. * Subsidiaries: GM Powertrain Sweden AB and SAAB Deutschland GmbH. The latter has a German sales and service subsidiary. (Sources: Saab Automobile, GM Sweden, GM Europe, Swedish Companies Registration Office)
