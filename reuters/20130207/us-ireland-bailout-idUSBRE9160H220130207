 DUBLIN  (Reuters) - Ireland's troika lenders said on Thursday that economic growth in the bailed-out country would firm to over 1 percent this year and over 2 percent in 2014. 
 "Ireland's strong track record of program implementation has been maintained, contributing to substantial improvements in market access and conditions for the sovereign and also - albeit more moderately - for the banks," the troika said. Conclusion of Ireland's troika review will make available disbursement of 2.6 billion euro from the EC/ECB/IMF, its lenders said in a statement after completing its bailout review.
