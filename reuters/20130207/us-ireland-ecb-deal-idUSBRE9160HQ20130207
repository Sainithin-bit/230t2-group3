 DUBLIN  (Reuters) - An agreement between the European Central Bank and Ireland on easing the country's debt burden is being sent to the Irish government for approval, a source close to the talks said on Thursday. 
 "It is in the process of being sent to the Irish government," the source said. The ECB and Ireland reached a compromise on a long-standing dispute over the cost of servicing money borrowed for a failed bank, a source involved in the discussions told Reuters on earlier Thursday.
