 MADRID  (Reuters) - Spain's decision to provide more transparency on its public debt and its banks confirms the government's commitment to austerity, Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez said on Saturday. 

 The consolidation process being undertaken by the country's savings banks to cut their numbers to below 20 from 45 will be completed by December 24, Zapatero told journalists following a meeting with the heads of Spain's top 37 companies to discuss ways of speeding up the economic recovery.
