 (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley widened its third-quarter loss outlook on Merrill Lynch & Co Inc MER.N, citing increased writedown expectations and lower revenue. 

 The brokerage widened its third-quarter loss estimate for the bank to $5.64 a share from $5.14, and said it expects $4.3 billion in incremental writedowns on top of the $5.7 billion writedown announced in July, bringing the total to $10 billion. "Excluding writedowns and one-time items, we are reducing third quarter underlying net revenue by $0.9 billion, to reflect broad-based market weakness," said analyst Patrick Pinschmidt, who has an "equal weight" rating on the stock. Morgan Stanley also said Merrill Lynch has also been hurt by a $350 million settlement and $125 million fine in connection with auction rate securities. However, all these losses are partially offset by a $4 billion pretax gain from the sale of Bloomberg stake and fair value gain on debt of $2.3 billion. Morgan Stanley raised its fourth-quarter earnings estimate to $1.59 a share from 59 cents to reflect an expected pretax gain of $3.5 billion from the sale of its controlling interest in Financial Data Services. The brokerage cut its fiscal 2009 estimate on the company to $2.00 a share from $2.66 and fiscal 2010 estimate to $2.65 a share from $3.14. Shares of the company were trading near flat at $18.05 Wednesday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by Santosh Nadgir in Bangalore; Editing by Amitha Rajan)
