 SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - Bank shares fell sharply across Asia on Wednesday, with South Korea's Shinhan Financial and India's ICICI slumping over 10 percent as the global credit crisis threatened to imperil Asian economies and bank earnings. 

 Panicky investors continued to dump financial shares despite fresh attempts by the U.S. central bank and other countries to try to contain the growing strains on the global banking system. Britain unveiled a multibillion pound rescue package for its banks on Wednesday that included plans to inject up to 50 billion pounds of government money into the country's biggest operators. Asian banks have largely escaped the debt destruction caused by the U.S. subprime mortgage meltdown, but investors are still shunning the region's financial sector, fearing the contagion and a possible recession in the West will not spare Asia. "We've been recommending selling financials for a very long time," said Daniel Tabbush, Asia bank analyst at CLSA in Bangkok. "If you don't have to be in financials, don't be in them because you have a worsening growth outlook." The MSCI index for Asian financial stocks outside Japan has slumped 49 percent so far this year to its lowest level in more than three years. The Dow Jones Stoxx European banking index fell nearly 3 percent on Wednesday, taking its losses in the year to date to around 42 percent, while the S&P financial subindex has retreated about 45 percent in 2008. HARDEST HIT Bank in South Korea were hardest hit on Wednesday after authorities said its lenders were having trouble raising foreign currency funds with foreign capital fleeing the country. By late afternoon, Shinhan Financial shares fell as much as 11 percent and Hana Financial slumped more than 8 percent. Shares of the country's biggest lender Kookmin have been suspended and will start trading again on Oct 10 as a holding company. In India, number 2 lender ICICI Bank fell 10 percent to almost a three-year low, dragging the benchmark Indian bank index down over 9 percent. "Definitely the global outlook for the sector is playing its role in crippling bank stocks, though their performance as of now is on expected lines." said Deven Choksey, Chief executive of brokerage K.R. Choksey. Banks in Japan also reeled amid heavy selling, led by losses in Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and Mizuho Financial Group. Mitsubishi UFJ ended 6 percent lower while Mizuho dropped 7.7 percent. In Indonesia, authorities had to suspend trade after the key stock market index fell over 10 percent, with PT Bank Mandiri Tbk, the country's biggest bank, slumping 8 percent. AUSTRALIAN RISK Australia' top banks, including Westpac Banking Corp and National Australia Bank Ltd, sank by over 6 percent, while Commonwealth Bank of Australia was on a trading halt for a share sale to help fund its A$2.1 billion takeover of BankWest, the Australian unit of British bank HBOS plc. "It was never going to be the best of days, and the de-leveraging continues," said David Spry, research manager at  Melbourne-based brokerage firm F.W. HOLST. "The Australian market has become a bit more of a risk." China's top lender, Industrial & Commercial Banking Corp, slumped 6 percent. This was despite Goldman Sachs calling its shares a buy given its low exposure to property developers and manufacturers, whose fortunes are tied to the downturn in global exports. But Goldman analysts warned in a note that Chinese banks could see the quality of assets underpinning their loans deteriorate as companies buckle under a global slowdown and poor earnings. Property prices in many parts of Asia have started to fall and home sales are slowing. Slumping financial markets are also slashing the value of banks' own investments and choking off once-lucrative revenue from the sales of market-linked products such as mutual funds. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Bank, a unit of global lender HSBC Holdings, fell 5 percent while Bank of East Asia tumbled 7.7 percent, as investors brushed aside a surprise policy easing by Hong Kong's monetary authority. Bank of East Asia was forced to deny rumors last month questioning its financial stability after thousands of customers lined up to withdraw cash from its branches. The losses in Singapore were led by the country's biggest lender, DBS Group Holdings, which was down 5.7 percent. UBS lowered its estimates for Singapore bank earnings by an average 8 percent for 2009 and 2010, expecting lower non-interest income and higher provisioning for bad debt even though it predicted the city-state's banks will not go into the red. "It's not an environment in which banks will see, I don't think, a re-rating or improved valuations. They should go lower," said CLSA's Tabbush.
