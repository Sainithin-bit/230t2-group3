 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. crude and gasoline inventories showed a higher-than-expected increase in the week to October 3, according to weekly data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration released on Wednesday. 

 Distillate stocks fell close to expectations. U.S. crude oil prices tumbled after the release of the data. HIGHLIGHTS FROM EIA REPORT (In million barrels): - Crude +8.1 (forecast +2.3) - Distillate -0.5 (forecast -0.4) - Gasoline +7.2 (forecast +1.1) ANALYST COMMENTS TIM EVANS, ENERGY ANALYST FOR CITI FUTURES PERSPECTIVE "The big builds in crude and gasoline were the big surprises in this week's data set, but the draw in distillate stocks was smaller than expected as well." PHIL FLYNN, ANALYST, ALARON TRADING, CHICAGO: "Obviously, that's a big crude build. A lot of people were hoping the refineries would be further along as far as the runs, so people are a little disappointed there. I knew the imports would be big, since this is all the back logged supplies we lost over the last few weeks due to Ike coming in  a big way." "Obviously this is bearish, and right now we're in a balancing act - should we focus on the tight supplies of product or should we focus on the macro economics slowing demand. I think we're going to continue to go back and forth with that." "Already the rate cut and the stock market seem to be overshadowing everything. We definitely sold off after these numbers came out, and now the inventories numbers are old news and we're going to focus again on what the stock market does for the rest of the day." "Big picture, are we concerned about the tight supply? We're nervous because we can't afford any other major disruptions either weather-wise or geopolitically, but on the other hand from the demand side of the equation it's still pretty pathetic across the board. Some of these demand numbers are storm-related and the rebounding taking longer than thought, but a lot of it is just good old fashioned demand destruction and people and businesses reacting to these high prices and the credit crisis." JIM RITTERBUSCH, PRESIDENT, RITTERBUSCH & ASSOCIATES, GALENA, ILLINOIS "The data looks bearish across the board, especially within the gasoline and crude segments. Gasoline supply finally showing the impact of strong import gains with crude imports also stronger than expected. The larger-than-expected increase in runs of 8.6 percent of capacity is also bearish and capable of maintaining pressure on the crack spreads. "The fact that crude supplies were able to build by more than 8 million barrels in the face of the huge jump in runs is also quite negative. Cushing crude supplies leveled, but the overall jump in crude cover should place some pressure on the WTI curve. The distillate number looks slightly supportive but heating oil will be pulled lower by the rest of the complex. Demand numbers still exceptionally weak across the energy spectrum. All in all, much lower prices are expected." TOM BENTZ, BNP Paribas Commodity Futures Inc., New York "Obviously, big build in the crude stocks, up 8 million, a lot more than expected. Imports are up sharply, that's what led to the crude stock build. It's kind of surprising because runs are up so much. "Gasoline stocks -- very big build there, I'm surprised at how big of a build there was there as well. You've got refinery margins for gasoline, in many cases, they are negative, so there is no incentive to make gasoline...but demand is down sharply as well, so I'm sure that's part of it." MARK KELLSTROM, ANALYST, STRATEGIC ENERGY RESEARCH, SUMMIT, NEW JERSEY "Obviously inventories are recovering off the back of the hurricane, and we're rebuilding lost barrels from the last three weeks. It looks negative for the crude market but inventory levels are still on the low side, and we would argue that it's more than discounted in the price of crude oil. The other thing to keep in mind, too, is that while some might point to demand for the build in gasoline, there have been pipeline related issues for getting the product to the Southeast." TOM KNIGHT, TRADER, TRUMAN ARNOLD, TEXARKANA, TEXAS: "Although the magnitude of the stock builds in crude and gasoline are sharply higher than expected, I find the latest EIA data showing no particularly big surprise here. People have been expecting a large increase in refinery runs as well. The big gasoline stock build has been telegraphed by the cash markets last week."
