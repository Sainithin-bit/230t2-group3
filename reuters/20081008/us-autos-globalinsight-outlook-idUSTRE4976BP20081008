 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Auto industry tracking firm Global Insight forecast on Wednesday that U.S. auto sales would fall further in 2009 from this year's depressed levels, as the escalating credit crisis has hurt consumer confidence. 

 U.S. industry-wide auto sales are expected to come in at 13.8 million units this year, their lowest level in 15 years, and could decline further to 13.4 million units next year, Global Insight said in a presentation to analysts and reporters. U.S. auto sales were 16.15 million units in 2007. "The credit crisis has really hurt the economy and consumer confidence," Global Insight said. "The economy will be particularly brutal on the auto market next year." (Reporting by  Soyoung Kim  and  David Bailey )
