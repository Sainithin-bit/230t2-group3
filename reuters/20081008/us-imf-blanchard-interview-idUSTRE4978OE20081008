 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - World finance leaders who improvised their way through the first year of the credit crisis may finally be ready to come up with a comprehensive plan to clean up the mess, the IMF's chief economist said on Wednesday. 

 In an interview with Reuters, Olivier Blanchard said policy-makers have had little choice but to react to each new emergency, but the rash of crises in recent weeks finally convinced them it was time for a broader response. A gathering of the Group of Seven finance leaders on Friday, followed by the IMF's weekend meetings, should provide an ideal setting for them to figure out what to do next. "Events focus the mind," Blanchard said. "What's absolutely essential to solve this financial crisis is the perception by the public and by the markets that there is a coherent plan." Six months ago, G7 leaders pledged to implement a series of recommendations to try to right the financial system, such as encouraging banks to disclose losses and raise new capital, but the crisis has worsened considerably since then and the response needs to change, too. European leaders balked at a proposal to set up a bank bailout fund similar to the $700 billion package recently passed in the United States, but the fact that they were discussing a coordinated response was a sign of progress. "We're now getting to the point where all governments understand that it has to be a coherent plan," he said. "From there to actually doing it, there are still a few steps, but that realization is now here," Blanchard said. It was probably "too much to ask" that G7 leaders emerge from Friday's meeting with an agreed, specific course of action, but he said he was confident that some progress would be made this weekend and in the coming weeks. Central banks took a giant step on Wednesday when they announced coordinated interest rate reductions. Blanchard said that provided a vital dose of investor confidence, but the markets' mixed reaction showed investors need more proof that world leaders were working together. Until that happens, there may be a few more "difficult days" in the markets, he said. He said in hindsight, it was clear that allowing Lehman Brothers to slide into bankruptcy triggered a far more dangerous bout of financial market turmoil that has now darkened the global economic outlook. He said the U.S. Treasury Department took a gamble that letting Lehman fall would send a clear signal to markets that the government would not always intervene. "It was a bet. It was lost. What happened as a result is all kinds of financial institutions realized that their claims were not as secure as they thought. As a result, this led to an enormous increase in perceived counterparty risk, and then the system froze." "Whether without it (the fall of Lehman) we would have avoided where we are today, I do not know. Some other event might have triggered the same thing a week later." (Editing by  Andrea Ricci )
