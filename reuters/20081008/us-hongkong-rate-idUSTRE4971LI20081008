 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Hong Kong slashed its main interest rate by 100 basis points, the biggest cut since the benchmark started a decade ago, as central banks around the world step up efforts to halt a growing global credit crunch hammering financial markets and depressing economic growth. 

 Economists say the move, which takes effect on Thursday, in addition to other measures recently, will not be enough to arrest mounting interest rates or bolster the fragile local economy. The economy may slip into recession in the fourth quarter as weakening global growth hits its exports and affects tourism. Officials warn that endemic reluctance to lend will stymie the financial system and batter the economy, at a time the world faces its greatest financial shock since the Great Depression. "This will not change the overall trend of rising interest rates because the credit crisis is global and most financial institutions are hoarding their money," said Daniel Chan, senior investment strategist at DBS Bank. Hong Kong, a global financial center and the main investment gateway into China, follows U.S. rate moves because its currency is pegged to the U.S. dollar. Futures markets see a 56 percent chance the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by 75 basis points on or before October 29. Local markets shrugged off the central bank's move. The benchmark Hang Seng Index dived 8.2 percent, as valuations plumbed depths not seen since the 1997/98 Asian financial crisis. "It could help banks with qualified collateral but since U.S. interbank rates are high, there is still pressure for the prime rate to rise," said Andrew Fung, General Manager and Head of Investment and Insurance at Hang Seng Bank. DECELERATION Australia's central bank on Wednesday said it was expanding the liquidity assistance it provides banks in money market operations, a day after slashing rates to protect its economy. Hong Kong, long a prominent beneficiary of China's rip-roaring rise to become the world's fourth-largest economy, will likely weather a downturn in the quarters ahead. Standard Chartered on Wednesday cut its forecast on Hong Kong's 2008 GDP to 3.7 percent from 4.6 percent previously. GDP may grow 2.3 percent in 2009 against an earlier estimate of 4 percent. "We lowered our growth forecasts due to tighter credits, falling stock markets and lower consumer confidence," Frances Cheung, economist at Standard Chartered, explained. "Today's rate cut will have a minimal impact on the economy." Hong Kong will cut the spread of its base rate, or discount window rate, to 50 basis points above the prevailing U.S. Federal Funds Target Rate from Thursday, from a current 150 basis points, under a "new formula," HKMA chief Joseph Yam said on Wednesday. That will be the single biggest reduction since 1998 when the formula for the base rate -- the reference on which the rates charged by the HKMA for borrowing by licensed banks through the discount window are calculated -- was in place. "As a result, there will be a cut in the base rate, effective tomorrow, from 3.5 percent to 2.5 percent," Yam said. For six months, the central bank will also stop referring to local interbank rates in its formula for determining the base rate, meaning the fed funds rate will take centrestage. "This may not have an immediate impact in the market, but we hope the new formula could help stabilize the interbank rates in the long run and lower the pressure on banks to lift lending rates," Yam added. Overnight HIBOR was fixed at 2.11 percent at 0315 GMT, versus 1.75 percent on Monday after a Tuesday holiday. The Hong Kong dollar was firmer at 7.7676/81 per U.S. dollar, close to the upper end of its usual 7.75-7.85 band. Wednesday's move followed a series of such measures announced last week, including the acceptance of U.S.-dollar assets as collateral in the interbank market. It was a strong message from the HKMA that they were going to support the market in whatever means they can, Standard Chartered's Cheung said. The central bank has said repeatedly it stood ready to provide liquidity if necessary. (Additional reporting by Judy Hua; Editing by  Edwin Chan  and Jacqueline Wong)
