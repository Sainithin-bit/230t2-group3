 BERLIN  (Reuters) - An interest rate cut by the European Central Bank on Wednesday is a sign for strengthening the economy and should help restore confidence, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said. 

 The ECB cut interest rates by 50 basis points to 3.75 percent as part of a coordinated operation by major central banks around the world. (Reporting by Andreas Moeser, writing by Paul Carrel)
