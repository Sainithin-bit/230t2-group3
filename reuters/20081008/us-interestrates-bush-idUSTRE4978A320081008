 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The White House on Wednesday said it hoped globally coordinated central bank interest rate cuts would start to stem the financial crisis that has hit markets worldwide. 

 "We are taking appropriate action as quickly as possible during rapidly developing market changes and will continue to do so," White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said. "We hope that this action will start to stem the crisis." In the first coordinated central bank move since the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States, the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of England and central banks of Switzerland, Canada and Sweden all lowered official rates by a half-percentage point. President George W. Bush will speak with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday about the crisis, Perino said. Some European leaders have called for an emergency meeting of the heads of the Group of Eight major industrialized countries. Perino said Bush was open to the idea of a meeting at the head of state level but that "right now we're all focused on the emergency issues and the actions that people can take." She echoed Bush's comments this week that the $700 billion financial bailout would take time to have an impact. "The government is going to do what it takes to make sure this financial system does not collapse," she said. (Reporting by  Tabassum Zakaria ; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
