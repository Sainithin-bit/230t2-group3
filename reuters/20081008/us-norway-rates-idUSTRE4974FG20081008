 OSLO  (Reuters) - Norway's central bank said it was not taking part in coordinated interest rate cuts with other central banks on Wednesday. 

 "We are not part of this," a Norges Bank spokeswoman said. She declined immediately to give any reason for the decision. Norway's main interest rate is at 5.75 percent after a series of increases aimed at controlling inflation as the oil-rich state's economy winds down after fast expansion. Norges Bank's policy-setting executive board next meets on October 29. (Reporting by Terje Solsvik)
