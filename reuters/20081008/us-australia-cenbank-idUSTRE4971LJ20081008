 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Australia's central bank on Wednesday said it was expanding the liquidity assistance it provides commercial banks in its money market operations, seeking to ease funding pressures from the global credit squeeze. 

 Just a day after slashing interest rates by an aggressive 1 percentage point, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) said it would accept more types of debt as collateral for loans and would lend to banks for longer periods. That should help meet banks' demand for longer-term funding which has been hard to get and more costly amid the credit crunch. "Conditions in global money markets have deteriorated significantly in recent weeks, with flow-on effects to domestic markets," the RBA said in a statement. The changes would give banks "greater flexibility to manage their liquidity in these circumstances," the RBA said. The central bank said it would ease restrictions on the types of residential mortgage back securities (RMBS) and asset-backed commercial paper it will accept as collateral for loans to banks. It will also offer six- and 12-month repurchase agreements each day in its operations, essentially lending for longer periods than currently. Furthermore, the central bank will remove restrictions on substituting collateral within an existing repurchase agreement, with the exception of general collateral. "This is another positive step to help ease pressures in the money markets and banking system," said Adam Donaldson, head of debt strategy at Commonwealth Bank. "The RBA is being very proactive." On Tuesday, the central bank cut its key cash rate by 100 basis points to 6.0 percent, the biggest cut in 16 years and twice as large as analysts had expected. "The longer term for repos will give banks more certainty in their funding, and that's very welcome," added Donaldson. While the RBA has provided plenty of funds to keep the overnight cash rate down, rates from one month onwards have been unusually elevated as banks around the world hoard cash and shy away from lending to each other.
