 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) shares tumbled nearly 7 percent on Wednesday, adding to this week's steep drop, as investors saw the bargain price for its share offering as a cue to sell. 

 The shares fell $1.56 to $22.21, just above the $22 price tag for its planned offering of 455 million shares. The stock drop decreased Bank of America's market value by about $6 billion. On Tuesday, it lost nearly $40 billion in its biggest-ever one-day drop. Meanwhile, the S&P Financial index .GSPF slipped 2.5 percent Wednesday. Bank of America, which agreed to buy investment bank Merrill Lynch & Co Inc MER.N last month, said on October 6 it planned to raise $9.76 billion in cash as it reported a 68 percent decline in quarterly profit and halved its dividend. It wants the cash for "general corporate purposes," it said late Tuesday, when it priced the offering. The bank's woes also dragged down Merrill, which fell 10.2 percent. Bank of America's shares have fallen 35.1 percent so far this week, while Merrill is down 38.2 percent. Matt McCormick, portfolio manager and banking analyst at Bahl & Gaynor Investment Counsel in Cincinnati, Ohio, said Bank of America's discount share offering is compounding investors' fears about what toxic assets may be on its balance sheet. He also said it will be difficult for the bank to realize synergies from its recent acquisition of Countrywide Financial Corp and the pending Merrill deal. "Add the fact that the banking industry is taking it on the chin, and people are taking this (share offering) as an opportunity to reduce exposure to this stock," McCormick said.
