 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The White House on Wednesday said the coordinated global interest rate cut by central banks was helpful to addressing the financial crisis. 

 "We respect the independence of the Federal Reserve in setting monetary policy," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said. "It is important and helpful that central banks are working in a coordinated way to deal with stress in the financial system." (Reporting by  Tabassum Zakaria ; Editing by Theodore d'Afflisio)
