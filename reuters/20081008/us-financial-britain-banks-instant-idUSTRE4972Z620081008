 LONDON  (Reuters) - The British government said on Wednesday it was "bringing forward specific and comprehensive measures to ensure the stability of the financial system and to protect ordinary savers, depositors, businesses and borrowers." 

 At least 200 billion pounds ($350 billion) will be made available to banks under a special liquidity scheme, and banks will increase their total Tier 1 capital by 25 billion pounds. Also, the government will provide an incremental minimum of 25 billion pounds of further support for all eligible institutions, in the form of preference shares, PIBS or as assistance to an ordinary equity fund-raising. ROBERT TALBUT, CIO, ROYAL LONDON ASSET MANAGEMENT "This is a useful step but I am disappointed that there isn't more detail in there about the precise amounts that are going to be injected into individual banks. "Also, the certainty as to what is going to be the targeted level for equity Tier 1 is lacking, and that is one of the key aspects that people are looking for. This is because it helps people make an assessment as to how strong a particular bank is - and we just don't know. "A fair amount of yesterday's (Tuesday) fall was related to the dilution to existing shareholders that comes about from this scheme. And also, the certainty that it's likely to mean dividends being passed at various banks." TONY DOLPHIN, DIRECTOR OF ECONOMICS AND ASSET ALLOCATION, HENDERSON GLOBAL INVESTORS "Clearly this is a bigger step than others have taken - it's very different from the TARP as there is the option for the government to take stakes in the eight banks that they've named. So in that sense it's a part nationalization. "I guess the assumption is that the banking system is sound and capable of functioning normally. The problem is the lack of confidence and liquidity, and the lack of capital at the banks. The idea with the special liquidity scheme and the capital injection is that the government provides the confidence that the system needs to function and when this has all blown over in two years' time, the government sells its share at a profit back to the private sector. "What the market needs at the moment is something that suggests the authorities are ahead of the game, because everything has felt reactive rather than proactive. Whether this does this or not, it is probably too early to tell." ALAN BROWN, GROUP CIO, SCHRODERS "Yes, I think it will help markets. In particular, there are features that are pleasant surprises. In particular. the guarantee of senior debt for three years. "So I think we got a little bit more than we were expecting as opposed to the straight 50 billion pounds and I suppose the market reaction so far in terms of the credit spreads tightening is quite healthy." HSBC "HSBC has no current plans to utilize the UK recapitalization program initiative announced today. "We do agree to observe the tier 1 capital requirements, but we will do this through our own resources." JEROEN VAN DEN BROEK, CREDIT STRATEGIST, ING "It seems to be a well thought-out plan. I like the Tier 1 component and it seems to be a relatively secure plan. "At least there is some action and it could be something that other countries could use as well. Shares and credit default swaps on UK banks have rallied, but they're not doing that in the rest of Europe. "The facility to provide capital will be in the form of preference shares. Tier 1 is subordinate to senior, it's the closest you can get to equity. "The Tier 1 market is essentially closed but if the UK government is offering Tier 1 capital to its banks, it really does improve balance sheets. That is very positive. "For shares, it's also better than if the government took a direct equity stake." CAZENOVE "The reaction of the debt markets is key -- 50 billion pounds is a substantial capital sum for UK banks and the commitment to provide liquidity is  also welcome. "Equity investors appear to be given the opportunity to provide the capital and so diminish the dilution, which is a positive development." RBS "We welcome this comprehensive package of measures in response to unprecedented conditions in the financial systems. "The government has increased support in a number of important areas. The proposals will enable us to strengthen our position and to support our customers across the economy." JEREMY GRIME, ARDEN PARTNERS "It ought to aid confidence although I'm not sure that the City is going to give it credit in terms of equity prices but it's all about confidence for the deposit holders at the moment. "We don't know what the dilution is and all that, what the terms of the lending are, so we don't know how dilutive this will be for equity holders. So there's still a lot of uncertainty for equity holders." CHRIS HOSSAIN, ODL SECURITIES "The provision of extra liquidity will hope to free up lending in the short to medium term. The hope is that this will kick-start the banking sector once again, and breathe a much needed air of confidence back into the system. "The risk is that if this doesn't work, where do we go next? A co-ordinated rate cut would logically seem to be the next step, but after that, there isn't much more we can do." CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER, ALISTAIR DARLING "It's very important that government right across the world do that. (At the meeting of European finance ministers) all of us agreed we need to do whatever's right and appropriate. Recapitalization is an important part of that." On report of RBS management changes: "RBS will make whatever announcements they need to make. It is not the government's business to deal with appointments." JOHN CRIDLAND, CBI DEPUTY DIRECTOR-GENERAL "The Chancellor's much anticipated announcement of capitalization will herald the first essential step on the road to financial recovery." HBOS "HBOS welcomes today's announcement by the government about banking capital and a significantly enhanced wholesale money funding initiative. "The government's announcement represents a very real and serious intention on the part of the authorities, following consultation with the banking industry, to bring stability and certainty to the UK banking system. "HBOS believes that this initiative is very much in the interests of its shareholders and customers." ONE CREDIT TRADER "The first thing I did was email my colleagues at Barclays and RBS to congratulate them on being civil servants now." (Writing by Dan Lalor)
