 LONDON  (Reuters) - European shares were down only slightly by midday on Wednesday after a dramatic coordinated rate cut by the world's top central banks lifted stocks from five-year lows hit early in the day. 

 The U.S. Federal Reserve led a round of cuts and eased by half a point, as did the European Central Bank, Bank of England and Swiss, Canadian and Swedish banks. At 8:07 a.m. EDT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 0.2 percent at 1,001.74 points, compared with losses of around 4 percent before the central bank move at 7:00 a.m. EDT and a slump of nearly 8 percent in early trade. "This is a very exciting move. The biggest move relative to market expectations was the ECB ... the fact of coordinated rate cutting is incrementally reassuring because it means people are working together, which gives extra comfort," said Bernard McAlinden, strategist at NCB Stockbrokers in Dublin. "But it certainly doesn't take away the problem. Rates are part of the solution as they always are in down cycles." Banks retraced much of their early losses after the rate cuts, but HSBC was still down 1.6 percent and Banco Santander down 1.7 percent. Belgian group KBC fell 8.2 percent. Banks have taken a battering over the past few days as investors shrugged off a $700 billion U.S. bailout package and focused instead on a drying up of money markets. Interbank borrowing rates remained high after the concerted cuts on Wednesday. The worst financial crisis since the Great Depression forced Britain to announce a multi-billion pound rescue package for banks that included plans to inject up to 50 billion pounds of government money into the country's biggest operators. British bank shares reacted positively overall, with HBOS jumping 58 percent -- also boosted by hopes that its deal to be taken over by Lloyds TSB would go through -- and Royal Bank of Scotland rising 20 percent. Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 was flat, Germany's DAX down 1.3 percent and France's CAC traded 1.2-1.8 percent higher, gaining ground after the rate moves. MORE BULLETS NEEDED? The day started dismally with European shares tracking Asian markets which featured Japan's Nikkei average tumbling 9.4 percent. U.S. stocks slid more than 5 percent overnight. Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero late on Tuesday said Spain will raise its guarantee for deposits in its banks to 100,000 euros and set up a 30 billion euro fund to buy assets from banks and keep credit flowing to the economy. Drug shares fell as investors reversed recent moves into defensives. Novartis slipped 3.3 percent and Roche lost 3 percent, while drugs-chemicals hybrid Bayer slid 6.4 percent. As in recent days, German carmaker Volkswagen was a standout gainer, up 6 percent. Morgan Stanley said its recent rise could be a result of sports car maker Porsche building a stake. But the focus was unequivocally on the bigger picture as central banks pulled out the stops. "The central banks are firing bigger and bigger bullets now. All bullets are fired when interest rates are much closer to zero; if deflation is what's in front of us, then that's not just theory," said McAlinden. (Editing by Quentin Bryar)
