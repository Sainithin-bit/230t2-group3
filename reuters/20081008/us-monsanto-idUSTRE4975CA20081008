 KANSAS CITY, Missouri  (Reuters) - Giant agricultural technology company Monsanto Co ( MON.N ) posted on Wednesday a smaller fourth-quarter loss on record revenues, as herbicide and seed sales climbed. 

 The herbicide and biotech seed producer said reported a loss from continuing operations for the quarter ended August 31 of $172 million, or 3 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of 18 cents a share on an ongoing basis. Analysts were expecting a loss of 4 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Quarterly sales totaled a record $2 billion, up 35 percent from a year before. The company said its fiscal 2008 adjusted earnings totaled $3.64 a share. Wall Street was looking for $3.65 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. St. Louis-based Monsanto offered an updated forecast to Wall Street just last week in a bid to restore investor confidence after its shares plummeted as part of a larger market slide. The company said it was increasing its gross profit target for 2012 to between $9.5 billion and $9.75 billion, up from $8 billion previously. (Reporting by  Carey Gillam , editing by Gerald E.
