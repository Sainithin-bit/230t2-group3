 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve should not be seen as an omnipotent crisis fixer, and any such expectations risk undermining the central bank's effectiveness, Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser said on Wednesday. 

 Plosser was speaking shortly after major central banks announced a global coordinated interest rate cut aimed at stemming a world financial crisis. He did not discuss the day's events but said monetary policy could go only so far. "Before we seek to dramatically expand the Fed's responsibilities, I believe it is important to recognize there are limits to what central banking can do," Plosser said in his remarks to the Council on Foreign Relations. Plosser argued that willy-nilly interventions in the market without clearly defined boundaries are not likely to work and could lead to much greater inflation down the line. He also said care would be needed in the debate over how much supervisory and regulatory responsibilities will ultimately lie with the Fed after the current crisis. "Some envision the Fed's becoming the supervisor and regulator of a broad array of financial firms in order to ensure financial stability," Plosser said. "Yet, before we seek to dramatically expand the Fed's responsibilities, I believe it is important to recognize that there are limits to what central banking can do, and this has implications for what central banking should do." The Fed needs to think about functional regulation rather than simply regulating institutions, Plosser added while answering questions from the audience. He said the Fed needs to mull which kind of failure in a market would put the payment system at risk and also about new financial products and the roles they play. "I think it's clearly true that this episode that we've experienced over the past year has been ... extraordinarily challenging," Plosser said. "Markets have a way of moving one step beyond of what you try to control to find ways around it," he added. However, the debate over supervision is likely to be overshadowed by the dramatic action by the Fed and other central banks on Wednesday. In an attempt to stem unprecedented global market turmoil, the Fed cut its key federal funds lending rate by half a percentage point to 1.5 percent and lowered its discount rate the same amount, to 1.75 percent three weeks before its next scheduled monetary policy meeting. The ECB also cut by a half point to 3.75 percent as did the Bank of England, taking its rate to 4.5 percent. China joined the effort, cutting its key rate 27 basis points. The Bank of Japan, with rates at just 0.5 percent, said it did not ease because it saw no need, but the Fed said the BOJ expressed strong support for the coordinated action.
