 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - IBM ( IBM.N ) ( IBM.N ) reported on Wednesday preliminary quarterly earnings that beat analysts' expectations and affirmed its full-year profit outlook, sending shares up nearly 6 percent. 

 COMMENTARY: CHUCK JONES, TECHNOLOGY ANALYST FOR ATLANTIC TRUST PRIVATE WEALTH MANAGEMENT, WHICH MANAGES $16 BILLION OF ASSETS FOR LARGELY HIGH NET-WORTH INDIVIDUALS. "It is very nice to see some positive news not just for IBM but for, to a degree, the tech space overall, given the downdraft we have seen in recent weeks. "At least it's a bit of a relief rally. It makes you feel more comfortable about IBM... "You can't see it as a wholesale 'all clear' for technology stocks. SAP just preannounced earlier this week. That's not surprising given that they are a software company. "The revenue was a little weak." Jones calculates that in constant currency terms revenue rose 2 percent compared with 6 percent growth on the same basis in the second quarter and 4 percent in the first quarter. "In a normalized tech spending environment, IBM wouldn't have reported 6 percent constant currency growth, but could have done 4 percent, all other things being equal" IBM made up the difference between top line and bottom line figures by tighter expense control to the tune of about $200 million by Jones' estimates. "It doesn't look like they became really draconian on their expenses. The bottom line is that they saved a couple of hundred million dollars." The outstanding question that investors will have to await to hear more detail on the conference call will be what IBM executives have to say on October 16 about how much of their business got pulled away due to concerns in the market, he said. "In this market you are gun-shy about everything. It is hard to have a lot of conviction about anything out there. This also can be a good time to buy stocks. When things look the bleakest, this is a good time to put some money to work." KIM CAUGHEY, SENIOR ANALYST, FORT PITT CAPITAL GROUP, WHICH OWNS IBM SHARES "Since the stock was at $120 three weeks ago and is now at $90, clearly investors were really worried about the technology market. For IBM to have done pretty well in the third quarter and affirm the full-year guidance is a good sign." "It's been my sense all along that this is not a tech problem. This is not 2001, and more importantly, the basic billing model of software has changed. The sudden crash out of Oracle Corp ORCL.O in 2001 is not going to happen." "The sudden crashes from overbuying married with a recession is not the problem. That's why in the past couple of days we've been buying names like IBM, because so much of its revenue is from recurring contracts. This validates our assumptions." MIKE HOLLAND, CHAIRMAN OF INVESTMENT COMPANY HOLLAND & CO, WHO OVERSEES ASSETS IN EXCESS OF $4 BILLION, INCLUDING IBM: "For companies to be reaffirming their outlook through the end of the year is h-u-g-e." "In this environment, the combination of meeting current expectations but also reaffirming their outlook is an incredible performance." "You made my evening," he told a reporter calling him with the news. (Reporting by Dai Wakabayashi in Seattle and  Eric Auchard  in San Francisco)
