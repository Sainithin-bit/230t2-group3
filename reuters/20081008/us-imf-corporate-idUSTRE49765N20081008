 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The intensifying credit crisis threatens to engulf healthier companies and emerging countries that until recently had shielded the global economy, the International Monetary Fund said on Wednesday. 

 In its twice-yearly World Economic Outlook, the IMF said the world economy was entering a major downturn "in the face of the most dangerous shock in mature financial markets since the 1930s," and warned that the recent turmoil had raised the economic risks considerably. Since the beginning of the credit crisis in mid-2007, emerging economies and companies outside of the hard-hit financial sector had proven resilient. However, the latest spike in risk aversion drove up borrowing costs across the board, and those two groups were starting to suffer. "A worrying aspect of this latest bout of turbulence is that there are now increasing signs that market strains are starting to fall more heavily on the nonfinancial corporate sector and on emerging markets," IMF researchers wrote. "If sustained, such strains could well foreshadow a more severe macroeconomic impact of the financial crisis than previously anticipated." Nonfinancial firms had strong balance sheets at the start of the crisis, something that U.S. officials often cited as a sign that the broader economy could withstand the Wall Street trauma. But in the past few weeks their access to short-term financing has tightened and equity prices have dropped. Emerging economies, which had little exposure to the bad assets weighing down banks' balance sheets in most of the rich nations, have also seen a spike in borrowing costs because the recent volatility has made investors risk-averse. The IMF said market conditions remained "exceptionally volatile" and it was hard to predict how long the disruptions would persist. The longer it lasts, the greater the risk of more widespread economic harm. "This, together with intensified and broadened deleveraging, would delay the recovery and increase the likelihood of a global recession," the IMF said. "Accordingly, recent developments suggest that the outlook for global growth has weakened considerably as a result of recent events and the downside risks to the baseline forecast have increased."
