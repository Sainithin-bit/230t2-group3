 CALGARY, Alberta  (Reuters) - Skidding oil-company stock prices and weak crude markets are setting the stage for another clawback in Canada's oil production outlook just as its biggest customer, the United States, seeks more secure supply. 

 Analysts say the worsening market meltdown and tumbling commodity prices spell conservative spending plans in corporate budgets, now being devised for 2009. That could mean more slowdowns in plans for oil sands projects and conventional drilling in Western Canada as companies seek to protect their cash. "Absolutely I think the expectations for oil sands growth out of Canada will likely have to come down over the next several years," Tristone Capital analyst Chris Feltin said. "Producers are going to make the prudent decision, and it may make sense to delay projects, to either wait for more favorable oil prices or cost estimates or staggered development among the various projects so they're not all happening at the same time." Despite the weak market, project costs remain high. Last month, Petro-Canada PCA.TO said the estimate its Fort Hills project in Alberta had climbed by 50 percent from its last guess to more than C$21 billion ($19 billion). The company and its partners are searching for ways to cut costs and get cash flowing faster, possibly by pumping raw tar-like bitumen before completing a processing plant, executives have said. Petro-Canada still aims to make its go-ahead decision by the end of 2008, spokeswoman Andrea Ranson said. She pointed out the bulk of the financing needs are about two years away. Such big projects as Nexen's NXY.TO Long Lake development and Canadian Natural Resources' ( CNQ.TO ) Horizon venture are now in startup mode after years of construction, so that means a solid boost to the short-term production outlook. But several companies have postponed their projects, blaming rising costs tied to a tight labor market and inflation in materials such as steel. That led the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers in this summer to temper its view of oil sands output, forecasting 2.8 million barrels a day by 2015, down from its previous outlook of 3.4 million. CAPP President David Collyer told Reuters last month that it is more likely that the forecast will be reduced again than increased given sputtering markets. INDUSTRY WOES DEEPEN Since then, those conditions have worsened for the industry. Oil settled below $89 a barrel on Wednesday, down 40 percent from its above $147 this summer. Meanwhile, stock prices have tumbled, in many cases to less than half of highs set just five months ago. At 232.97 points, the Toronto Stock Exchange's oil and gas subindex has lost a third of its value in the past month, dropping to a level not seen since May 2005. Tight global credit markets will also affect the ability of the country to boost production, analysts said, making it difficult for many companies, especially small ones, to get the debt they need to fund drilling projects. Overall oil production in Canada, the largest foreign supplier to the United States, is expected to average 2.77 million barrels a day this year, up only slightly from 2.73 million in 2007, according to the latest estimates from the National Energy Board. One bright spot for Canadian oil producers is heavy-grade crude, with U.S. refiners spending billions of dollars to add equipment to process it, said Steve Fekete, analyst for energy consultants Purvin & Gertz. "Crude oil's falling but Canadian heavy is actually been fairly strong over the past year, surprisingly strong," Fekete said. "It should stay strong into next year because there appears to be a tightness in the supply-demand balance." Canadian heavy crude is currently worth about 83 percent of light oil, compared with 73 percent at the start of the year. Production of heavy crude and unprocessed bitumen is expected to average 1.04 million barrels a day this year, up 4 percent from 2007, the NEB figures show. Pipeline capacity is growing quickly to get Canadian crude to the U.S. Gulf Coast, where there is capacity to process up to 7 million barrels of heavy oil a day, John Langille, vice-chairman of major heavy oil producer Canadian Natural, said at a London conference on Tuesday. "This gives us a great market for the oil that we are developing as part of our long-term plan and we will be able to ... receive a price for it there that is a much better price than what we get in the Midwest of the U.S. today," he said.
