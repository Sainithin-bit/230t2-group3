 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - There is little chance of a global depression provided that world finance leaders quickly adopt coherent policies to address market distress, the chief economist of the International Monetary Fund said on Wednesday. 

 "If the right policies are put in place, then the probability of a great depression is very small," Olivier Blanchard told a press conference. He said leaders in Europe were having "some difficulty" agreeing on the best approach, but financial markets were forcing them to move more quickly and if they succeed, "the risk of a great depression is nearly nil."
