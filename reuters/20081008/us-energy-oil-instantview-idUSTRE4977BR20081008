 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. crude and gasoline inventories showed a higher-than-expected increase in the week to October 3, according to weekly data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration released on Wednesday. 

 Distillate stocks fell close to expectations. U.S. crude oil prices tumbled after the release of the data. HIGHLIGHTS FROM EIA REPORT (In million barrels): - Crude +8.1 (forecast +2.3) - Distillate -0.5 (forecast -0.4) - Gasoline +7.2 (forecast +1.1) ANALYST COMMENTS TOM BENTZ, BNP Paribas Commodity Futures Inc., New York "Obviously, big build in the crude stocks, up 8 million, a lot more than expected. Imports are up sharply, that's what led to the crude stock build. It's kind of surprising because runs are up so much. "Gasoline stocks -- very big build there, I'm surprised at how big of a build there was there as well. You've got refinery margins for gasoline, in many cases, they are negative, so there is no incentive to make gasoline...but demand is down sharply as well, so I'm sure that's part of it." MARK KELLSTROM, ANALYST, STRATEGIC ENERGY RESEARCH, SUMMIT,  NEW JERSEY "Obviously inventories are recovering off the back of the hurricane, and we're rebuilding lost barrels from the last three weeks. It looks negative for the crude market but inventory levels are still on the low side, and we would argue that it's more than discounted in the price of crude oil. The other thing to keep in mind, too, is that while some might point to demand for the build in gasoline, there have been pipeline related issues for getting the product to the Southeast." TOM KNIGHT, TRADER, TRUMAN ARNOLD, TEXARKANA, TEXAS: "Although the magnitude of the stock builds in crude and gasoline are sharply higher than expected, I find the latest EIA data showing no particularly big surprise here. People have been expecting a large increase in refinery runs as well. The big gasoline stock build has been telegraphed by the cash markets last week."
