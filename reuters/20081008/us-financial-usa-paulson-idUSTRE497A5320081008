 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Wednesday urged intensified global cooperation to stabilize financial markets and said countries must be careful not to harm one another while they guard their own interests. 

 "Governments have and must continue to take individual and collective actions to provide much-needed liquidity, strengthen financial institutions through the provision of capital...and protect the savings of our citizens," he said in a statement. Paulson, along with Treasury Under Secretary David McCormick, spoke ahead of Friday's Group of Seven gathering of finance ministers and central bankers from rich nations that is to focus heavily on the effort to calm markets.
