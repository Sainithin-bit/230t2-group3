 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve led a coordinated round of global official rate cuts on Wednesday, easing by a half-point, as did the European Central Bank, Bank of England and Swiss, Canadian and Swedish banks. 

 In an attempt to stem unprecedented global market turmoil, the Fed cut its key federal funds lending rate by half a percentage point to 1.5 percent and also lowered its discount rate by the same amount to 1.75 percent. The ECB also cut by a half-point to 3.75 percent as did the Bank of England, taking its rate to 4.5 percent. KEY POINTS: * US Federal Reserve says cutting Fed funds rate 1/2 percentage point to 1.5 percent * Fed says acting in coordination with ECB and Central Banks in Canada, UK, Sweden, Switzerland * Fed says acting because of growing evidence of weaker economic activity, reduced inflation pressure * Fed says intensifying financial market turmoil likely to further restrain spending * Fed says also cutting discount rate by 1/2 point to 1.75 percent COMMENTS: CHARLES DIEBEL, HEAD OF INTEREST RATES STRATEGY AT NOMURA, LONDON: "The central banks of the world have finally woke up to the gravity of the current situation with coordinated rate cuts across the globe. The Fed, ECB, MPC, SNB, Riksbank, BoC. Even China joined the party with a 27bp rate cut. "The market reactions have been predictable with the long end of every major curve coming off. This is a major step to convincing the world that they are serious about stabilizing the current crisis. PAUL DALES, UK ECONOMIST, CAPITAL ECONOMICS "It's pretty much what has been expected, but just ahead of schedule. This is the start of a trend that's going to take interest rates to take interest rates down to a low level of perhaps 2.5 percent, and it's encouraging that the Bank, along with all the other central banks is staring to realize the need for lower rates across the board." TOM HOUGAARD, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST AT CITY INDEX, LONDON "The market likes it. We were looking for something like this to happen. It's good to see the FTSE 100 being up on the day. Let just see where we are going to close today. That's the most important. If we can get a good close today, I will be more optimistic." "It won't do the trick ... We are in a structural bear market. We will have some relief now. That's what important." PETER DIXON, ECONOMIST, COMMERZBANK, LONDON "The fact that we have got them coming across the board suggests that this is the end game. Everything that we have heard from central banks in the past two-three weeks has got out of the window. This is a coordinated monetary action to prevent a bigger meltdown. "Will it help? Only time will tell. Will it help the markets? Questionable in the short term. Will it help the economy? No because basically we have got to work through the next weeks, months and years to find out exactly what the implications of recent events are going to have." PHILIP SHAW, INVESTEC "I think it undoubtedly will help sentiment and a 50 basis point cut domestically is to be welcomed. If you put everything together: the rate cut, the recapitalization and the forthcoming details on the BoE's liquidity operations, there are some big glimmers of hope after a very torrid 3 1/2 weeks, where the outlook has been looking increasingly gloomy. "Where we go from now for rates is unclear, and we would suggest that rates should probably come down again. But we await further clues from central banks, and obviously we will have to monitor macroeconomic and financial trends." REN CHENGDE, SENIOR STOCK ANALYST AT GALAXY SECURITIES IN SHANGHAI: "The slew of market-rescuing steps will surely spark a decent stock market rebound in China tomorrow, say more than 2 or 3 percent. "But the essential problem that is now depressing the Chinese market comes from overseas, and if foreign markets cannot stabilize, the Chinese market will lose the momentum of a rebound again in the medium term." PETER BOOCKVAR, EQUITY STRATEGIST, MILLER TABAK & CO, NEW YORK "All global central banks are doing everything they can. This was another piece of that puzzle. "We knew that the fed funds was pricing in a rate cut. "I guess a shock and awe type move with respect to easing liquidity and improving the current climate was in order." "For now its going to work." "The deleveraging process is happening no matter what." OLLE HOLMGREN, SEB, STOCKHOLM "It is logical that they have reacted in this way." "This certainly isn't the last cut either. You can bring forward the cuts they have put in their prognoses. It will be a support to growth, but it's still the case that we face a period of low growth, and that won't change because of what they have done here." JIM AWAD, CHAIRMAN OF W.P. STEWART & CO. LTD. IN NEW YORK: "It's helpful. It's a happy constructive event. It's part of a process, but it's not sufficient." "I think any rally in the markets will be temporary. I think the earnings season is going to be very difficult, I think the damage for the economy is baked into the cake, so I'm happy they did it. You might get a short term rally, but will not solve our problems." SUBODH KUMAR, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, SUBODH KUMAR & ASSOCIATES, TORONTO "If it's just rate cuts, that's more of a psychological factor for the markets. So I would see this as a secondary factor, the primary one being the injection of liquidity. "This reduces the cost for the commercial banks, so the sequence of events ... (the Fed) has to first cut the cost and improve the availability of funds from the credit markets. "The stock markets are below levels that I would consider appropriate in terms of already having discounted a recession of the severity of 2000-2001." KNUT HALLBERG, SWEDBANK, STOCKHOLM "A coordinated global action is very positive. There are both domestic and international reasons for this. It is very helpful and is beginning of a solution to the crisis. I think we should expect more rate cuts." ANNIKA WINSTH, NORDEA, STOCKHOLM "It is an important signal that the central banks are making an effort, that they intend to do everything in order to rectify what is happening in the market, and that signal is very important." "As far as economic conditions are concerned, I think more will be needed in order for households and businesses to come back, but it is an important signal for the market." "But this is not enough to solve the problems, absolutely now. More measures will be needed."
