 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - PC maker Dell Inc. said on Wednesday that founder and Chairman Michael Dell would become chief executive, effective immediately, replacing Kevin Rollins. 


 For several quarters, Dell has suffered market share losses to a reinvigorated Hewlett-Packard Co.. Dell said in a statement that Rollins had resigned, effective immediately, and also is leaving the board. Below are comments on the change from market sources: COMMENTARY: BRENT BRACELIN, ANALYST AT PACIFIC CREST SECURITIES "It's tough for me to sit here and say that's a good thing," speaking of the departure of Rollins and the recent resignation of Dell's chief financial officer. "There certainly was pressure for a change in leadership. Frankly, I'm a little surprised that there was a change. "This type of disruption at a company that will likely do $60 billion in revenue over the next year and a half is certainly concerning." CHARLES WOLF, ANALYST AT NEEDHAM & CO. OWNS DELL SHARES "Obviously the company's financial performance deteriorated and has been in a state of deterioration after (Rollins) took over. "There's been no turnaround and the bottom line is Michael was the one who built the company. On balance I would say this is probably a necessary move," JAMES RAGAN, ANALYST AT CROWELL, WEEDON & CO, BASED IN LOS ANGELES AND OWNS LESS THAN 1,000 DELL SHARES. "It's not a complete surprise. Obviously, Rollins was under pressure. The fact they've missed the number is not a good sign." "Net, net it's probably something that needed to be done and will hopefully lead to some changes, such as regaining market share, improving product quality and product innovation." "I think HP is competing very well against them other than that there may be some margin pressure but I don't have a real feel for that." RICK CAMPAGNA, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, PROVIDENT INVESTMENT COUNCIL, PASADENA, CALIFORNIA "With Dell, the question in my mind is are they also going to guide down for '07. "Both Dell and Google are going to have a big effect tomorrow, probably on the whole market, certainly on techs." (Contributions from Sinead Carew, Caroline Valetkevitch and Duncan Martell)
