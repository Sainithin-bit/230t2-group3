 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Michael Dell replaced Kevin Rollins as CEO of Dell Inc. on Wednesday as the No. 2 PC maker struggles with missteps in the U.S. consumer market and lost market share to Hewlett-Packard Co.. 


 The company also warned that results in its current quarter would fall below analysts' estimates, the latest sign of the challenge it faces from its reinvigorated rival HP. Michael Dell started the company in 1984 out of his college dorm room with $1,000, and led it to the top of the PC industry. News of his return boosted Dell's shares by nearly 5 percent. Dell, 41, always has been chairman of the company but handed over the top management job to Rollins, 54, in 2004. Wall Street "has been calling for his head for a long time," said Endpoint Technologies Associates Roger Kay of Rollins, who also left Dell's board. "He has to bring in new blood," Kay said of Dell. "They need to bring in new people who are creative, energetic, who can bring spice to the company." Dell pioneered a "build to order" model in the personal computer industry and rode the success with years of rapid growth and rising profits, eventually becoming the top PC maker. But Dell lost that title last year to HP in what was a tough year for the Round Rock, Texas-based company. Dell last year recalled batteries made by Sony Corp. in the biggest-ever consumer electronics recall. It has also had complaints of poor after-sales service. In December, Dell named former American Airlines chief Donald Carty as chief financial officer, replacing James Schneider, who left as Dell faced probes into its finances. "It's tough for me to sit here and say that's a good thing," Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brent Bracelin said of the Rollins departure on top of the recent CFO resignation. Rollins became CEO in July 2004 after years as president and chief operating officer, and both Dell and Rollins have touted their close business relationship. Yet it is not immediately clear what Dell must do to get its results and growth back on track, analysts said. Eric Ross of ThinkEquity Partners said the profit warning was Dell's third financial miss in three quarters, noting that it faces continued market share loss and a tough pricing environment. Reuters Estimates and First Call both said Wall Street, on average, expected earnings of 32 cents per share on revenue of $15.3 billion. "Doubling down on their old strategy is probably not going to be the solution because they are so much bigger now," said Daniel Renouard, an analyst with Robert Baird & Co. Shares of Dell jumped to $25.35 in extended trade. In regular trade, the stock fell 7 cents to close at $24.22. The stock has fallen some 17 percent in the past year.
