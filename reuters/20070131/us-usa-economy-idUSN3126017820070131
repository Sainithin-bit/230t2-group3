 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. economy grew at a stronger pace than expected in the final quarter of 2006 without raising inflation pressures, government data showed on Wednesday, as robust consumer spending more than offset the biggest slump in housing in 15 years. 


 That report was followed by Federal Reserve policy-makers' decision later on Wednesday to keep the benchmark overnight federal funds rate steady at 5.25 percent. The Fed again warned about the risks of inflation but also pointed to some signs of a stabilizing housing market. Gross domestic product, the broadest measure of overall economic activity within U.S. borders, expanded at a 3.5 percent annual rate during the October-through-December quarter, according to the Commerce Department. U.S. government bond prices rose after the Fed decision, with investors taking the Fed's statement as a signal chances of any rate increase this year are slim. "The way I read it there is no sense of urgency from the Fed to change rates," said Bill Hornbarger, chief fixed-income strategist at A.G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis, after the central bank's decision. Bond prices were already higher after a soft January reading on business activity in the Midwest, the nerve center of the nation's manufacturing sector, suggesting at least one key area of the economy was flagging early this year. The National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago Index showed a reading of 48.8, which was well below expectations and pointed to a contraction for business in that region. U.S. stocks rallied and the dollar fell against the euro and the yen after the Fed decision. HEALTHY GDP MEANS NO RATE CUT SOON The rise in GDP was the best quarterly reading since the beginning of last year, when the slide in the U.S. housing market was not yet fully evident. It also was a healthier pace than the annual growth rate of 3 percent that economists were expecting. The GDP report was touted by Bush administration officials and Republican lawmakers, who have been saying the strong economy is a reason to keep the administration's tax cuts in place. "The only weak spot in the economy is housing and the very good news is that the economy is so robust that it's been able to grow at a very steep pace despite the fact that the housing sector has slowed," Council of Economic Advisors Chairman Ed Lazear told reporters on an Air Force One flight to New York. There were, though, some signs of weakness in the report. BUSINESS INVESTMENT SLIPS Business investment during the quarter fell 0.4 percent, breaking a streak of 14 consecutive quarterly increases. But aided by lower energy prices as well as strong growth in real wages, consumer spending advanced at a4.4 percent rate in the fourth quarter. "While I do not expect the pace to continue, the fact that real wages have accelerated recently is a good harbinger for the economy in 2007," said David Huether, chief economist of the National Association of Manufacturers. On the inflation front, the central bank's favorite measure of nonfood, nonenergy inflation -- the so-called core personal consumption expenditures price index - moved ahead at just a 2.1 percent rate, down from the 2.2 percent seen in the prior quarter. That was just slightly above the top of the range many Fed officials have identified as their "comfort zone." For the year, GDP grew 3.4 percent after a 3.2 percent gain in 2005. Still, motor vehicle output restrained GDP sharply during the last quarter. Excluding motor vehicle production, GDP would have been up at a rate of 4.8 percent for the quarter. Spending on new home building slid at a rate of 19.2 percent during the quarter, as the housing market continued to weaken and by 4.2 percent for all of 2006. These were both the largest declines, respectively, since 1991. A separate Labor Department report showed that employment costs -- another piece of the economy's pie that inflation-wary Fed officials are watching -- rose a less-than-expected 0.8 percent in the fourth quarter. The increase in the Employment Cost Index, a broad gauge of what employers pay in wages and benefits, eased from the third quarter's 1.0 percent gain and was below economists' forecast of a 1.0 percent increase, the data showed. Meanwhile, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported that applications for U.S. home mortgages increased last week, with both purchasing and refinancing activity picking up.
