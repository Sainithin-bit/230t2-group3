 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Eastman Kodak Co. EK.N posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday due to lower costs and its photo kiosk business, which offset a 25 percent drop in sales of digital cameras and accessories. 


 Shares of Kodak, the top maker of photographic film, rose 1 percent in morning trading after the company said it managed to boost sales from kiosks, which are self-service terminals where customers can edit and print digital photos. But sales of digital cameras fell as the company focused on products with higher profit margins, and fourth-quarter revenue missed average Wall Street estimates. "This quarter revenue was light (and) most of their profitability comes from intellectual property licensing, which is nonrecurring," said Cross Research analyst Shannon Cross. "We continue to believe that investors are most focused on what is going to happen on February 8." At the investor meeting next week, Kodak's first after twice postponing in 2006, executives are expected to shed light on the company's outlook once all the restructuring is done. Kodak is also expected to introduce new products, possibly including inkjet printers. Kodak, which says it is nearing the end of a lengthy and expensive effort to shrink itself into a provider of digital photography printing products and services, reported fourth-quarter net income of $16 million, or 6 cents a share, compared with a loss of $46 million, or 16 cents a share, a year before. Excluding one-time costs and other special items, the quarterly profit was 59 cents a share, beating the average analyst forecast of 56 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. But revenue fell 9 percent to $3.82 billion and was short of the Wall Street consensus of $3.95 billion. Analysts said that included $123 million of nonrecurring licensing revenue. The Street has found it difficult to measure Kodak's overall health due to the constant restructuring over the past three years, with some units growing and adding workers and others cutting operations and jobs. "Kodak's model has benefited from cost cutting and the restructuring, and they continue to monetize their intellectual property," said Cross. "However, the question remains what the long-term earnings power of the company is once they sell the health imaging business." Earlier this month, Kodak said it would sell its medical imaging business, its second-most-profitable unit in the fourth quarter, to a unit of Canada's Onex Corp. TOC.TO for up to $2.55 billion. Global consumer digital group earnings from operations were $150 million, compared with $40 million a year earlier, on sales of $1.154 billion, which were down 13 percent. Kodak last year warned that its digital revenue growth would slip as it focused on selling products that generate higher profits. Accordingly, global sales of consumer digital cameras, memory products, and related items decreased 25 percent in the fourth quarter. Gross profit margins were 26.4 percent in the current quarter, up from 23 percent in the prior year quarter. Since late 2003, Kodak has focused on digital devices, hoping to outpace the drop in demand for film, historically its main revenue source. At the same time, it is reducing costs by cutting up to 27,000 jobs and trimming manufacturing. Kodak shares were trading at $25.79, up 27 cents on the New York Stock Exchange.
