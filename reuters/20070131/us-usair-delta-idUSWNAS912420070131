 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - US Airways Group Inc. ( LCC.N ) on Wednesday withdrew a hostile offer for bankrupt Delta Air Lines Inc. DALRQ.PK after Delta creditors rejected the bid, taking immediate pressure off rivals to merge. 


 US Airways, the No. 7 U.S. airline, pulled its $9.8 billion offer after Delta's official creditor committee, which plays a decisive role in determining the carrier's future, said it will support Delta's plan to exit Chapter 11 as a stand-alone company. "The creditors' committee reached this determination after engaging in extensive discussions with representatives of Delta and US Airways over the last two months," it said in a statement, ending US Airways' 11-week effort to acquire its larger rival. The demise of US Airways' bid for Delta, the No. 3 U.S. airline, should put the brakes on consolidation in the fragmented and highly-competitive U.S. airline sector for now. "This probably puts an end to (merger talk)," said airline consultant Michael Boyd. "There never was any need for airline consolidation." Rivals such as UAL Corp.'s UAUA.O United Airlines and Continental Airlines CAL.N engaged in preliminary talks on a tie-up in the wake of the US Airways bid for Delta. Analysts have said the U.S. airline industry is overdue for consolidation because of high costs and aggressive competition, which puts pressure on air fares and has led to repeated bankruptcy for a number of carriers. But reluctant management and anti-trust concerns have stemmed deal making. Recent capacity cuts and few orders for new aircraft mean the industry is better positioned than in the past to withstand a downturn, said Boyd. US Airways' shares rose 4 percent on relief the deal had been called off. Delta shares, which will be canceled upon exiting bankruptcy, fell 6 percent. STAND ALONE US Airways, the smallest of the legacy carriers, is confident it can compete on its own against rivals, such as the world's No. 1 carrier, American Airlines, a unit of AMR Corp.  AMR.N. "We are extremely confident in our own stand-alone plan," US Airways Chief Executive Doug Parker said in a statement. US Airways posted a net profit of $12 million in the fourth quarter, recovering from a year-earlier loss of $261 million. "Looking forward, we expect even higher earnings," CEO Parker said. But US Airways, formed in 2005 from a merger with America West, still has work to do. "They've still got to get the last merger done. They've got a lot of debt issues, a lot of (information technology) issues," said Boyd. "They've got a lot on their plate. It's not like they're bored." And some observers expect to see US Airways looking to shake up the industry again at some point. "I personally think they are going to turn their attention very rapidly to other markets," said airline consultant Stuart Klaskin of KKC Aviation. "If I were the management team at Northwest Airlines, I would be awaiting the call from Parker." Delta shares fell 8 cents to $1.08 in over-the-counter trading, while US Airways rose $2.88 to close at $55.98 on the New York Stock Exchange.
