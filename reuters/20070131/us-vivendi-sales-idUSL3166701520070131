 PARIS  (Reuters) - French media and telecoms group Vivendi ( VIV.PA ) reported a slightly disappointing 1.2 percent rise in fourth-quarter sales on Wednesday, including a revenue decline at its mobile operator SFR that pushed down its shares. 


 Analysts said the 2.1 percent drop at SFR, France's number two mobile operator, proved steeper than expected but turnover from the group's popular online video game, World of Warcraft, and from Maroc Telecom helped offset it. The stock was down 1.95 percent at 31.63 euros by 1040 GMT, underperforming the media sector index .SXMP, which stood 0.78 percent lower. Vivendi, which was initially due to publish revenue figures after the market close on Wednesday, said total turnover rose to 5.545 billion euros ($7.2 billion) for the three months to December 31. "It's SFR which is disappointing. Their sales are 100 millions euros less than what I was expecting," one London-based analyst said, declining to be named. SFR, which is controlled by Vivendi and 44 percent owned by Vodafone ( VOD.L ), was hit by price cuts due to regulation and competition. The mobile company's sales fell to 2.181 billion euros in the quarter from 2.228 billion a year ago. Network revenues -- a closely watched figure -- fell 0.9 percent to 2.067 billion. The group's full-year sales reached 20.044 billion euros, up from 19.484 billion in 2005 but slightly below expectations of 20.1 billion from a Reuters poll of nine analysts. Two analysts, one in London and another in Paris, said the sales figures were slightly below expectations but could not give more details as they were still distilling them. "My first impression is that the numbers are somewhat below expectations, but I am still going through them," one analyst in London said. Vivendi, which owns Universal Music Group, the world's largest record company, did not give an update on its full-year profit targets nor forecasts for 2007. Maroc Telecom's ( IAM.PA )( IAM.CS ) fourth-quarter sales rose 4 percent to 499 million, and video game revenues were up 33.1 percent at 326 million euros. The Paris-based group blamed adverse currency movements for a 1.5 percent drop in music revenues to 1.657 billion euros. Revenues from its pay-TV business, Canal Plus, were up 4.9 percent to 918 million euros year-on-year on a comparable basis.
