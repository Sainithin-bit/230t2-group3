 LONDON  (Reuters) - Vodafone Group Plc vowed not to pay "over the top" in the multi-billion-pound battle for India's Hutchison Essar as the UK mobile giant beat forecasts for customer sign-ups and crossed the 200 million user mark. 


 Chief Executive Arun Sarin said on Wednesday final bids in the auction for a controlling stake in India's fourth-biggest mobile operator were still weeks away and that the probability of Vodafone's success remained "very hard to call". Europe's most valuable telecoms company is one of at least four bidders eyeing a 67 percent stake put up for sale by parent Hong Kong's Hutchison International Ltd, and Hutchison Essar's rising valuation has led to concerns Vodafone could overpay. "(This asset is) very strategically aligned with what we have been saying to shareholders ... We will participate fully, but we are not going to go over the top," Sarin told reporters. "We have twin financial criteria (for acquisitions), which we have highlighted. We will be using these criteria in determining what the ceiling price is," he added. Vodafone has been accused by some investors of overpaying for acquisitions in the past, most recently in its $4.55 billion purchase of Turkey's Telsim in December 2005. The group behind the most expensive acquisition in history -- the 180 billion euro purchase of Germany's Mannesmann in 2000 -- last year unveiled strict acquisition criteria after relations with some investors had reached a boiling point. "The reiteration of strict investment criteria for acquisitions should ... allay the fear that they will overpay in India, even though the competition for (Hutch) Essar appears fierce," said Wesley McCoy at shareholder Standard Life. The bidding for Hutchison Essar, ultimately controlled by Hong Kong-based ports-to-telecoms conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa , kicked off late last month with valuations of $13 billion to $15 billion but have reached as high as $20 billion. Vodafone, which is battling India's Reliance Communication and the Essar and Hinduja groups in the auction, has been keen to raise its exposure to India, the world's fastest growing mobile market, which is adding 6 million new users each month and has plenty of room to grow. CROSSES 200-MILLION MARK The world's biggest mobile operator outside of China said its customer base had crossed the 200 million customer mark as it beat forecasts for new sign-ups, with 8.7 million customers taking up its services in the fiscal third quarter to December 31. "It took us 15 years to get our first 100 million customers," Sarin told reporters. "It took us five years to get the next 100 million. There is good momentum in the business." Vodafone said mobile revenue rose 6.1 percent in the key Christmas quarter, with growth in emerging markets far outpacing core Western Europe markets. Vodafone was expected to add a net 7.5 million customers in the quarter and increase revenue by 6.2 percent, according to the average forecasts of 12 analysts polled by Reuters. "The third-quarter key performance indicators at Vodafone continue to show a more resilient picture in Western Europe than expected, with revenue growth in UK and Italy notable positives," noted Standard Life's McCoy. Vodafone shares were up 1.9 percent at 149-3/4 pence by 1142 GMT. The shares have gained about 28 percent in the past five months as they recover from a turbulent 2006, during which Sarin survived a rebellion from shareholders upset at his efforts to tackle slowing growth in core European markets. The stock trades at 13.6 times forecast earnings, compared with 14.1 times for the DJ Stoxx European telecoms index. Vodafone also reiterated its full year forecasts that mobile revenue growth would be within a range of 5 to 6.5 percent and the mobile EBITDA margin one percentage point lower. Earlier this week, rival Deutsche Telekom sent shivers through the sector with a profit warning -- its second in six months -- blaming fierce competition in the German market. "Vodafone outperformed (Deutsche Telekom's) T-Mobile in Germany and produced decent improvements in revenue growth in the UK and Italy," analysts at Goldman Sachs said.
