 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc. ( C.N ) plans to fill its open chief financial officer job within 45 days, and is seeking someone who might eventually rise to a higher job at the largest U.S. bank, Chief Executive Charles Prince said. 


 The position opened up on January 22, when Citigroup said current CFO Sallie Krawcheck will become global wealth management chief once her successor is named. She replaces Todd Thomson, who was ousted amid concern over his spending. Prince is trying to rebuild a depleted management team, cut costs, and boost revenue in U.S. consumer banking, corporate and investment banking and international operations to end what he called a "painful" lag in Citigroup's stock price. Speaking on Wednesday at a Citigroup-sponsored financial services conference, Prince said "there is an enormous amount of interest, both internally and (from) people interested in joining the organization," in the CFO job. Prince said a successful candidate should be "brilliant," have "very deep experience, obviously, in the field of being a CFO," and have broad financial services experience, including on international issues. "Any time you fill a very senior position, you're looking for someone who can step up to even broader things," he added. Prince is 57. Other top Citigroup officers are older, including executive committee chair Robert Rubin, Chief Operating Officer Robert Druskin and Chief Administrative Officer Lewis Kaden. "They need someone with a background in countries growing faster than the U.S., and in step with Prince on cost-cutting," said Scott Armiger, a portfolio manager at Christiana Bank & Trust Co. in Greenville, Delaware, which owns Citigroup stock. Prince directed Druskin to finish by the end of March a review of expenses, which totaled $52.02 billion last year. The review, which Prince called a "vacuuming out," focuses on "structural" changes, such as possibly eliminating multiple back offices that support a single business or country. Druskin is examining "150 or 200 different focal points," Prince said. Prince also plans more small acquisitions in 2007, with a majority involving "non-U.S. consumer-oriented businesses." On Monday, Citigroup agreed to buy Internet bank Egg from Prudential Plc ( PRU.L ) for $1.1 billion. Prince declined to discuss the departure of Thomson, once considered a possible future Citigroup chief executive. "There have been a lot of unfortunate facts that have gotten into the newspapers," Prince said. Citigroup shares rose 66 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $54.93 in afternoon trading. Through Tuesday, they were up 19 percent since Prince became CEO in October 2003, lagging respective gains of 34 percent and 46 percent at Bank of America Corp. ( BAC.N ) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. ( JPM.N ).
