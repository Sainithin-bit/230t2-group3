 (Reuters) - India's Tata Steel ( TISC.BO ) is set to become the world's fifth-biggest steelmaker after winning a battle for Anglo-Dutch steelmaker Corus Group CS.LCS.AS . 


 Here are some key facts about India's Tata Group: * The salt-to-software Tata Group comprises 96 operating companies in seven business sectors -- including steel, salt, software, energy, cars and trucks, and chemicals. * The group, founded by Jamsetji Tata in the mid-19th century, has grown into one of India's largest business conglomerates, with revenues in 2005-06 of $21.9 billion, the equivalent of about 2.8 percent of the country's GDP. * Tata companies together employ some 202,712 people. * The group has 28 listed enterprises and the top firms -- Tata Steel, Tata Consultancy Services, Tata Motors and Tata Tea -- have a combined market capitalization that is the highest among Indian groups with a shareholder base of over 2 million. * The group has operations in 54 countries and its companies export products and services to 120 nations. * Ratan Tata, since becoming chairman in 1991, has transformed the once-staid group by cutting the number of companies from over 300 and acquiring more than 15 new businesses abroad.
