 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp. ( SBUX.O ), the world's largest coffee shop chain, on Wednesday said quarterly earnings rose 18 percent as the number of stores grew and established outlets attracted more customers. 


 Net income for the fiscal first quarter was $205 million, or 26 cents per share, compared with $174 million, or 22 cents per share, a year ago. Wall Street analysts, on average, had been expecting earnings of 26 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales at coffee shops open at least 13 months, a key retail measure known as same-store sales, rose 6 percent during the quarter. The company said the number of transactions at established stores rose 4 percent, while the average value of each sale rose 2 percent. Total revenue rose 21.8 percent to $2.36 billion. Wall Street was expecting revenue of about $2.35 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Starbucks has stepped up the pace of its store growth and said it opened a record 728 locations during the quarter. It plans to open a total of 2,400 coffee shops this year. ADDING STAFF To support its aggressive expansion, the company has been adding more assistant managers and retail support staff in the United States. Store operating costs have risen because of an hourly wage increase for employees. That rise put pressure on Starbucks shares in recent weeks, according to Mike Koskuba, portfolio manager for Victory Newbridge, part of Victory Capital Management. Koskuba, added, however, that results in the first quarter looked good. "It does look as though they posted solid results," Koskuba said. "It looks like the stock's trading up a bit on that news." Starbucks shares were up 1.3 percent at $35.40 in after-hours trade after closing at $34.94 on Nasdaq. Store operating costs were 38.5 percent of company-operated retail revenue in the first quarter, compared with 38.2 percent in the same period last year. Dan Geiman, an analyst with McAdams Wright Ragen, said store operating costs were higher than he expected, though they were offset by lower-than-expected general and administrative expenses. "In the end, it looks like everything is right where it should have been," Geiman said. Starbucks said it still expects to earn between 87 cents and 89 cents per share for the year. Analysts are expecting earnings of about 89 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. The company expects same-store sales to rise between 3 percent and 7 percent this year and forecast overall revenue growth of about 20 percent. Starbucks' stock trades at about 39 times analysts' average 2007 earnings estimate, compared with an average multiple of 19.7 for companies in the Dow Jones U.S. restaurants and bars index .DJUSRU.
