 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co. ( 7267.T ) posted a smaller-than-expected rise in quarterly profit as fierce competition in China weighed on sales, and it left its operating profit forecast unchanged despite a big lift from a weaker yen. 


 The world's second-most valuable carmaker, with a market worth of $72 billion, had been riding demand for its small and fuel-efficient cars amid $3-a-gallon gasoline, but said it was feeling headwinds now with pump prices down at $2.2 to $2.3. The Tokyo-based automaker also said it had set its expectations too high for the booming Chinese market, and lowered its sales target there by about 20,000 units to around 360,000 vehicles for the business year to the end of March. "The Asian market didn't recover for us as much as we had thought," Executive Vice President Satoshi Aoki told a news conference. "Our sales target for China ended up being too ambitious." Sales of Honda's flagship Accord sedan have been badgered in China by the launch of Toyota Motor Corp.'s ( 7203.T ) popular Camry. Toyota, meanwhile, this month raised its sales growth outlook for China in 2007 to 40 percent from 33 percent. Honda's October-December net profit rose 8.8 percent to 144.83 billion yen ($1.19 billion), short of an average estimate for 153.6 billion yen in a survey of five brokers by Reuters Estimates. Operating profit rose 5.2 percent to 205.11 billion yen, below market estimates for 215 billion yen. Foreign exchange gains added 10.6 billion yen, but cost cuts could not keep up with a rise in raw materials prices, Honda said. Revenue grew 12 percent to 2.77 trillion yen on brisk car sales in North America, Europe and Asia. "The profit numbers do not look appealing considering that their auto business is supposed to be doing well," said Masayuki Furukawa, analyst at Fukoku Capital Management Inc. Honda nudged up its net profit forecast for the full year to the end of March to 560 billion yen from the previous 555 billion yen, attributing much of it to non-operating, derivates-related gains. At the operating level, it stuck to its forecast for an 820 billion yen profit despite additional currency windfalls of 51 billion yen on top of its reading three months ago. Honda altered its assumption for the dollar's average rate to 117 yen for the year from 115, and the euro to 149 yen from 145. Weaker-than-expected sales volumes in each business segment -- motorcycles, cars and power products -- as well as a big rise in recall-related costs and incentives spending would offset forex gains of 107 billion yen for the year, it said. "I think the market will be a bit spooked by this," said UBS Securities auto analyst Tatsuo Yoshida. "The positive impact from forex is huge." Honda estimated it would spend about $100 million more on sales incentives this business year in North America than it reckoned in October. LOSING ITS EDGE? Honda is one of the healthiest and fast-growing carmakers in the world backed by solid products such as the CR-V crossover and Fit subcompact. Big U.S. rivals, meanwhile, are losing customers and burning through cash as they restructure their North American operations. Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) last week booked a net quarterly loss of almost $5.8 billion -- more than Honda expects to make in all of 2006/07. But Honda's results underscore the unquestionable lead that rival Toyota enjoys in most markets as it looks set to overtake General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) as the world's biggest carmaker as early as this year. Japan's top carmaker is expected to post a double-digit rise in third-quarter operating profit when it reports next Tuesday. Nissan Motor Co. ( 7201.T ), which lost its No.2 sales ranking among Japanese automakers to Honda last year, is expected to report weaker profits this Thursday. Earlier, Toyota's minivehicle unit, Daihatsu Motor Co. ( 7262.T ), reported a 20 percent jump in nine-month operating profit to 30.41 billion yen and a 16 percent rise in net profit to 16.80 billion yen on robust sales. It left its full-year forecasts unchanged. Honda shares gained 18 percent in October-December, just beating the Tokyo transport sector subindex .ITEQP.T. The stock trades at around 15.3 times forecast earnings, against Toyota's 16.4 times. Honda shares ended down 1.25 percent at 4,750 yen on Wednesday ahead of the results.
