 TOKYO  (Reuters) - NTT DoCoMo Inc., Japan's top mobile phone operator, posted an 18.4 percent gain in quarterly profit on Wednesday, helped by cost cuts, but kept its forecast as it expects tougher competition toward the end of the business year. 


 DoCoMo posted its first net loss in subscribers in November after KDDI Corp. and Softbank Corp. launched new price plans and advertising campaigns that challenged its 55 percent market share. "The subscribers who left to (KDDI's wireless service) 'au' from us cited cheaper prices as their main reason for switching, although I don't really think their plan is cheaper," DoCoMo Chief Executive Masao Nakamura told a press conference. Competition is expected to build up toward March -- a peak month of subscriber migration and the end of the financial year in Japan -- especially as customers are now able to keep their existing phone numbers even after switching operators. Operating profit was 160 billion yen ($1.32 billion) in the fiscal third quarter ended December 31, up from 135.1 billion yen a year earlier, according to Reuters' calculations. That compares with an estimate of 172.9 billion yen at Lehman Brothers. Quarterly sales rose slightly by 0.4 percent to 1.214 trillion yen. DoCoMo, the world's second-biggest wireless operator by sales, also maintained its operating profit forecast of 810 billion yen for the year ending March 31. Last year's profit was 832.6 billion yen. "With regards to (the forecast for) this year, it depends on the spring sale season starting February," Nakamura said. "Commissions paid to retailers are on the rise and the number (of handsets we can sell) is still unclear." "It looks fairly tough at the moment," he said. The market forecasts operating profit of 809 billion yen at DoCoMo this year, based on a set of 16 brokerage estimates. Nakamura also said the company's capital investment for the current business year may exceed the planned 916 billion yen by as much as 20 billion yen. For next year, he said the figure may come down by about 150 billion yen. "Network investment has reached its peak this year," he said. DoCoMo had boosted its spending to match the connectivity of KDDI's third-generation (3G) services, and has successfully been migrating more subscribers to its high-speed infrastructure. KDDI, with 29 percent of Japan's mobile subscriber market, last week raised its full-year profit forecast by 7.5 percent to 342 billion yen, citing a lower customer cancellation rate and increased returns from services such as music downloads. Softbank, which last year bought Vodafone Group Plc's wireless unit for almost 2 trillion yen, is also winning subscribers after it slashed prices and renewed its handset line-up. Softbank will announce earnings results on February 8. In the three months to December, during which the new number system was introduced, DoCoMo's share in the industry's net subscriber signups stood at 9.8 percent, far behind KDDI's 73.3 percent and 16.9 percent at Softbank. DoCoMo said its subscriber cancellation rate rose to 0.93 percent in the recent quarter from 0.72 percent a year ago. The company also said its average monthly revenue per user (ARPU) fell 3.6 percent in the third quarter to 6,670 yen from a year earlier, although sales from data usage rose. Nakamura said the key to next year's earnings would be how to lift revenues from music downloads, Web-surfing and other data-related services. DoCoMo on Wednesday announced a new flat-rate price plan for data communication, which also lets subscribers browse Web sites designed for PCs. Shares in DoCoMo, which are 59 percent owned by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. rose 5.3 percent in the three months to December 31, underperforming KDDI's 9.6 percent jump, and the 6.8 percent rise on the Nikkei benchmark DoCoMo fell 0.54 percent on Wednesday in Tokyo before the company announced its results, outperforming the overall market.
