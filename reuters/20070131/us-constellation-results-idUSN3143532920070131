 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Power company Constellation Energy Group Inc. CEG.N said on Wednesday fourth-quarter earnings more than doubled, helped by stronger-than-expected results from its merchant unit. 


 Net income rose to $405 million, or $2.22 per share, from $195.2 million, or $1.09 per share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, discontinued operations, certain hedges and earnings related to synthetic fuel production, the company said it earned $1.08 a share. The average forecast of analysts polled by Reuters Estimates was 89 cents a share. Revenue fell to $4.59 billion from $5.12 billion a year earlier. Results from Constellation's merchant unit increased 42 percent from last year's quarter, driven by higher new business, higher margins and lower costs. Those were partially offset by the end of competitive transition charge collections in Maryland. The company's regulated Baltimore Gas and Electric Company posted a 28 percent decline in earnings, attributed to less favorable weather conditions and inflationary and other cost increases. The company also raised its quarterly dividend by 15 percent. The company reaffirmed its earnings target for 2007 of $4.30 to $4.65 per share. For 2008, the company still expects to earn $5.25 to $5.75 per share. The company said it expects 2009 earnings growth of 10 percent over 2008 earnings. (Additional reporting by Christopher Kaufman)
