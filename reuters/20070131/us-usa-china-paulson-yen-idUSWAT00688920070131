 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said on Wednesday he was watching the value of the Japanese yen "very, very carefully," but that its current low value reflected economic fundamentals. 


 Paulson acknowledged U.S. auto manufacturers were concerned about the recent drop in the value of the yen, but told the Senate Banking Committee he did not believe the Japanese government was managing the decline. "What I said to the auto manufacturers is that there has been no intervention in the yen since March of 2004," Paulson said. "I don't think there has been verbal intervention for almost a year. I don't like verbal intervention, I don't think it determines where markets trade." President George W. Bush and Paulson heard directly from U.S. automakers in November, when they met with the chief executives of General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler AG's Chrysler unit. U.S. auto manufacturers complain that Japanese government statements, often referred to as "verbal intervention" in financial markets, can prevent the yen from rising, even when the central bank is not intervening in the market through the sale and purchase of currencies. The yen hit a four-year low against the dollar on Monday. The last time the Bank of Japan intervened in the foreign exchange market -- at that time, to stem appreciation in the yen -- was in March of 2004. Speculation on the direction of the yen intensified after Germany's finance minister said on Tuesday that Europe's concerns about yen weakness will be discussed next week at the Group of Seven rich countries meeting. Paulson referred to that upcoming meeting, when asked about automakers' concerns about the value of the yen. "I'm watching the Japanese currency very, very carefully. I talked with the finance minister several weeks ago. I'll see him when I'm in Germany in Essen at the end of next week," Paulson said. The yen rose sharply after Paulson's comments, which currency traders interpreted as a sign the United States could move closer to Europe's position in the G7 talks. The dollar slid against the yen, to 120.64 yen from around 121.28 yen, where it was prior to the headlines from Paulson. The greenback later recovered to trade at 121.00 yen. The euro plunged to 156.84 yen from around 157.67 yen before crawling back to 157.30 yen. However, Paulson said he believed the yen's value was being driven by economic fundamentals. "This is an economy where there has been weak growth or there has been deflation, and so interest rates are very low. And I think it's those economic fundamentals that are driving (the yen)," Paulson said. "I'm watching it carefully but the things that concern me are exchange rates, excuse me, currencies where the value isn't determined in a competitive marketplace, and the yen is a broad, deep, competitive marketplace," he said.
