 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Time Warner Inc. ( TWX.N ) reported on Wednesday that quarterly profit rose 34 percent, boosted by AOL Internet asset sales in Europe and more digital cable and phone customers, but shares slipped as analysts said its 2007 outlook was overly conservative. 


 Net income rose to $1.75 billion, or 44 cents per share, in the fourth quarter, from $1.3 billion, or 28 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items such as the $769 million gain on the sale of AOL businesses in the United Kingdom and France, the company earned 22 cents per share, matching the average analyst expectation from Reuters Estimates. The media conglomerate, which until now has not provided annual earnings-per-share forecasts, said 2007 profit could rise to about $1 per share, including an expected gain of 10 cents from the sale of some AOL properties, from 81 cents in 2006. Analysts, on average, expected 2007 profit of $1.01 per share, according to Reuters Estimates, though it was not immediately clear if their calculations included gains from AOL sales. Several analysts, including ones from Bear Stearns, Bernstein Research and Merrill Lynch, said they assumed the consensus estimate did not include the 10-cent gain. The 2007 outlook was "a little muted," said analyst Christopher Marangi of Gabelli & Co., which owns Time Warner stock. "It appears guidance is below what Wall Street was expecting." He said he expected continued strong performance from Time Warner Cable, and improvement at the Warner Bros. film unit, this year. Shares of Time Warner fell 1 percent in afternoon trading. In the fourth quarter, their cable systems and cable networks, such as CNN and TNT, drove revenue and profit growth, offsetting declines at the Warner Bros. movie studio and AOL, which is going through a major overhaul. Time Warner also owns the HBO pay-cable network. Revenue increased 8 percent to $12.47 billion, narrowly beating Wall Street expectations of $12.35 billion. Time Warner also said it established a $600 million legal reserve to deal with pending securities lawsuits related to  AOL CABLE, AOL GROWTH SEEN Time Warner Cable, which purchased the assets of bankrupt Adelphia Communications Corp. ADELQ.PK, is in the process of improving the systems. Cash flow margins at the new properties were historically in the low 30 percent range, compared with the high 30s at the ones they already owned, said Oppenheimer & Co. analyst Thomas Eagan. "The big question for cash flow guidance is on their ability to bring up the margins on cable," said Eagan. Time Warner executives said on a conference call they were upgrading the acquired cable systems and aimed to begin selling new phone services to boost margins. Time Warner Cable lost 23,000 basic video subscribers in the fourth quarter, dragged by a loss of 52,000 subscribers from the Adelphia systems. It expects to stem the basic video subscriber losses in the second half of the year, or sooner, by offering packages combining video, phone and broadband services. Quarterly results benefited from an increase in broadband and digital phone subscribers, sending cable division revenue up 58 percent to $3.7 billion, and operating profit up 46 percent, excluding items. At AOL, advertising sales growth outpaced the industry average, as it made most of its services available for free. Fourth-quarter online ad sales rose 49 percent, topping 46 percent in the third quarter. But AOL's overall revenue fell 8 percent to $1.86 billion, dragged by restructuring charges and the loss of dial-up Internet subscribers. Operating income fell 10 percent. At the film division, revenue dropped 15 percent and cash flow declined 39 percent as it failed to top the theatrical hits of the previous year, such as the blockbuster "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire" and DVD sales of "Batman Begins". The company sees 2007 total adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization rising at a mid-to-high-teen percentage rate from $11.1 billion in 2006. Time Warner also said it expected to complete a $20 billion stock buyback program by the first half of 2007. Shares of Time Warner fell 27 cents to $21.77 on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has risen about 25 percent in the past 12 months.
