 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve held benchmark interest rates steady on Wednesday and maintained a warning on inflation risks as it noted signs of stability emerging in downtrodden housing markets. 


 The widely expected decision by the central bank's Federal Open Market Committee to hold the overnight federal funds rate at 5.25 percent -- the level it hit in June after 17 straight quarter-percentage point increases -- was unanimous. In a statement outlining its decision, the Fed said it continues to focus on inflation risks and once again held out the option of raising rates to tamp down price pressures. "The extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth," the Fed said, expressing concern tight economic conditions may make it hard to bring inflation down. Prices for U.S. stocks and government bonds rose and the dollar weakened after the rate announcement. "The Fed recognizes that the economy has improved modestly and inflation has abated somewhat," said Tom Sowanick, chief investment officer at Clearbrook Financial in Princeton, New Jersey. The Fed's decision after a two-day meeting comes with the U.S. economy showing some vigor despite a housing slump that the central bank referred to as "substantial" after its prior meeting in December. At the same time, however, there are signs inflation is easing. "Recent indicators have suggested somewhat firmer economic growth, and some tentative signs of stabilization have appeared in the housing market," the central bank said on Wednesday. "Overall the economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters," it said. The nation's output expanded at a surprisingly robust 3.5 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, the government said earlier on Wednesday. Despite the solid pace of activity, the central bank's favorite measure of nonfood, nonenergy inflation moved ahead at just a 2.1 percent rate, a touch slower than in the third quarter and just a hair above the top of the range many Fed officials have identified as their "comfort zone." Steady growth -- also apparent in strong hiring, upbeat consumer moods and gains in demand for pricey manufactured goods -- appears to have confirmed the Fed's view that the housing slowdown would not spill over into the broad economy. At its last meeting on December 12, Fed policy-makers had taken note of "mixed" economic data and a "substantial cooling" of the housing market. At the time, one Fed official was sufficiently concerned about economic weakness to propose the central bank adopt a statement saying it was equally worried about growth falling short of the mark as too-high inflation. But as signs of economic resilience have emerged, analysts have begun scaling back bets on Fed interest-rate cuts and the statement by policy-makers on Wednesday reflected an upgrading of their assessment of the health of the housing market. Recent economic data, including stronger-than-expected readings on housing activity in December, has led some analysts to the view that rate increases, and not decreases, are the most likely next step for the Fed. "If the economy can pull off a 3.5 percent growth rate without housing and autos, imagine how much hotter economic activity will be once those sectors come back on line. And they will," Bernard Baumohl, managing director of the Economic Outlook Group in Princeton Junction, New Jersey, said before the Fed announced its decision.
