 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. pharmaceutical company Bristol-Myers Squibb ( BMY.N ) has hired three Wall Street banks ahead of a possible offer from France's Sanofi-Aventis ( SASY.PA ), the Financial Times reported on Tuesday. 


 Bristol-Myers hired Lehman Brothers LEH.N to work with Citigroup ( C.N ) and Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) to examine its options in anticipation of a bid, the Financial Times reported on its Web site, citing people familiar with the companies. The move could trigger a bidding war for Bristol-Myers by attracting rival pharmaceutical companies such as Pfizer ( PFE.N ), Schering-Plough SGP.N and Merck KGaA ( MRCG.DE ), the newspaper reported. Lehman declined to comment. Citigroup and Morgan Stanley were not immediately available for comment. A Bristol spokesman was also not immediately available for comment.
