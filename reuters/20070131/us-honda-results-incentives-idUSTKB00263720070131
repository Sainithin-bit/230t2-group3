 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co. ( 7267.T ) said on Wednesday it expects to spend $100 million more this business year ending in March on sales incentives in the North American markets than it had planned three months ago. 


 A Honda official said fierce competition was forcing the firm to offer bigger sales incentives on light trucks, while a drop in gasoline prices was also forcing it to boost incentives on its aging Accord model.
