 LONDON  (Reuters) - Standard Life Investments said on Wednesday it sold its entire 7.5 percent stake in Corus CS.L after India's Tata Steel ( TISC.BO ) won a bid battle for the Anglo-Dutch steelmaker with a 6.2 billion pounds offer or 608 pence per share in cash. 


 "Tatas have now paid a fair price. We are happy with the outcome," David Cummings, head of UK equities at Standard Life Investments said in a note. Standard Life was previously the biggest institutional shareholder in Corus. Corus shares were up 7 percent at 601.5 pence. The offer by Tata Steel topped a final bid of 603 pence from Brazil's CSN ( SID.N ). Both offers were right at the top end of what analysts had thought possible.
