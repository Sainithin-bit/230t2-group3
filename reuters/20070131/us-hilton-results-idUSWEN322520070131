 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Hilton Hotels Corp. HLT.N on Wednesday reported a rise in fourth-quarter net income, helped by higher room rates, unit growth and acquisition of the hotel assets of Hilton Group last February. 


 Hilton said net income rose to $207 million, or 50 cents a share, from $105 million, or 26 cents a share, a year earlier.
