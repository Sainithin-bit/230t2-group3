 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rallied on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve held rates steady and did not signal a shift in policy for now. 


 In the statement with its decision, the Fed raised no additional concerns about inflation, easing fears of a rate increase in the near future, analysts said.  "If they are less edgy about inflation, then any fears of a rate increase are pretty much off the table," said Sam Rahman, portfolio manager of Baring Asset Management in Boston. Before the decision, the Dow average and S&P 500 index were up slightly, while the Nasdaq was in negative territory. Stronger-than-expected earnings from aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. ( BA.N ) bolstered the Dow and the S&P 500 early in the session as well as a report showing robust economic growth in the fourth quarter. Boeing was up 4.7 percent at $90.01. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was up 111.28 points, or 0.89 percent, at 12,634.59. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was up 10.46 points, or 0.73 percent, at 1,439.28. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was up 14.96 points, or 0.61 percent, at 2,463.60. (Additional reporting by  Chris Sanders )
