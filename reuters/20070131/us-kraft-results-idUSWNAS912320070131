 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Kraft Foods Inc. KFT.N posted a sharply lower quarterly profit on Wednesday as the company continued to work on plans to revive its business. 


 The earnings report came the same day that Altria Group Inc. ( MO.N ) said it plans to spin off its 89 percent stake in Kraft on March 30. The largest North American food maker earned $624 million, or 38 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, compared with $773 million, or 46 cents a share, a year earlier. The maker of foods ranging from Oreo cookies to Maxwell House coffee said sales fell 3 percent, to $9.4 billion, in part from the effect of divestitures and having one less shipping week in 2006 compared to 2005.
