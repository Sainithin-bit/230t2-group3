 LONDON/PARIS  (Reuters) - U.S. pharmaceutical company Bristol-Myers Squibb has hired additional Wall Street banks ahead of a possible offer from French peer Sanofi-Aventis, people familiar with the situation said on Wednesday. 


 Lehman Brothers and Citigroup were recently brought on board -- joining Morgan Stanley which was retained a year ago -- to examine options in anticipation of a bid from Sanofi, the sources said. French newsletter La Lettre de L'Expansion sparked fevered speculation of a takeover approach by the Paris-based drugs giant on Monday, when it reported that the two companies had signed a "pre-merger" agreement. Healthcare bankers said they did not believe any deal had yet been signed but Sanofi was looking at options for taking over Bristol-Myers, with which it has a long-time marketing alliance. Sanofi and Bristol-Myers have both declined to comment, and a French trade union source said Sanofi had also not briefed staff representatives on the situation. Sanofi's bankers were BNP Paribas and Merrill Lynch when it bought Aventis in 2004. All the banks involved have declined to comment. Buying its U.S partner would make Sanofi the world's number one drugmaker -- a coup for Sanofi Chairman Jean-Francois Dehecq, a veteran dealmaker, who is to retire at the end of 2009. The companies jointly market blood pressure drug Avapro as well as bloodthinner Plavix, a blockbuster drug which is currently subject to patent challenges in a U.S. court. Many analysts believe Sanofi and Bristol-Myers could well agree on a takeover, given their existing partnership. But a number remain confounded about the recent deal between Bristol-Myers and AstraZeneca on two diabetes drugs. "Sanofi has every interest in doing a friendly deal because its main risk lies in the execution of the merger, in a shock of cultures," Aurel Leven analyst Jerome Berton said. "If you brush the target up the wrong way it will complicate the integration." But Sanofi is not shy in hostile situations. The agreed bid for Aventis in 2004 followed a takeover fight that lasted several months and featured Swiss drugmaker Novartis as a possible white knight for Aventis. Other analysts said a similar bidding war could ensue if Sanofi made its move for Bristol-Myers. Oddo Securities analyst Jean-Jacques Le Fur expects rivals would want to block Sanofi in becoming a dominant player in several therapeutic fields, such as cancer. Among possible European suitors, he ranked Novartis and GlaxoSmithKline. "There's no smoke without fire and the smoke is getting thicker," Oddo's Le Fur said. "The fire must be smouldering." He also referred to the Bristol-AstraZeneca deal as possibly triggering a fight. "One can't sell such an interesting asset while merger talks are supposed to be going on," Le Fur said. "It doesn't make any sense." A final deal for Sanofi to buy its smaller U.S. partner could hinge on the outcome of U.S. patent litigation on Plavix. A key court case over the drug began last week, with the two allies fighting a challenge from Canadian generic drugmaker Apotex. A verdict could come in the third quarter of the year. Most analysts bet Sanofi and Bristol-Myers will win the U.S. case. Sanofi shares fell 1.5 percent to 67.55 euros by 1410 GMT, taking losses to 3.4 percent this week, reflecting investor concerns that buying Bristol-Myers might dilute Sanofi's future earnings.
