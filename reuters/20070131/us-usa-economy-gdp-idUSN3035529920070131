 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. economy grew at a stronger pace than expected in the final quarter of 2006 without raising inflation pressures, government data showed on Wednesday, as robust consumer spending more than offset the biggest slump in housing in 15 years. 


 But that report, released on Wednesday by the Commerce Department, was followed by a soft January reading on business activity in the Midwest, the nerve center of the nation's manufacturing sector, suggesting at least one key area of the economy was flagging in the new year. Gross domestic product, the broadest measure of overall economic activity within U.S. borders, expanded at a 3.5 percent annual rate during the October-through-December quarter, according to the Commerce Department. U.S. Treasury debt prices rose on Wednesday after the soft reading on the National Association of Purchasing Management's Chicago Index showed a reading of 48.8, which was well below expectations and pointed to a contraction for business in that region. In midday trading, the dollar sank against the yen after U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson told lawmakers he is watching the yen closely. But U.S. blue-chip stocks gained on Wednesday as aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co.'s ( BA.N ) earnings beat forecasts and the robust GDP report increased investors' optimism about the outlook for corporate profits. HEALTHY GDP MEANS NO RATE CUT SOON It was the best quarterly reading in the GDP report since the beginning of last year, when the slide in the U.S. housing market was not yet fully evident. It also was a healthier pace than the annual growth rate of 3.0 percent that economists were expecting. Consequently, it strengthened their sentiment that the Federal Reserve will not cut interest rates soon. "Overall, we're seeing some very good growth data, combined with some friendly inflation data, which overall supports the view of a steady Federal Reserve," said Alex Beuzelin, senior market analyst at Ruesch International, in Washington, D.C. This strong reading on the final quarter of last year is the last piece of key data that the Federal Reserve's policy-makers will weigh when they wrap up their interest rate-setting meeting on Wednesday afternoon. The report was touted by Bush administration officials and Republican lawmakers, who have been saying the strong economy is a reason to keep the administration's tax cuts in place. "The only weak spot in the economy is housing and the very good news is that the economy is so robust that it's been able to grow at a very steep pace despite the fact that the housing sector has slowed," Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Ed Lazear told reporters on an Air Force One flight en route to New York. There were, though, some signs of weakness in the report. BUSINESS INVESTMENT SLIPS Business investment during the quarter fell 0.4 percent, breaking a streak of 14 consecutive quarterly increases. But aided by lower energy prices as well as strong growth in real wages, consumer spending advanced 4.4 percent in the fourth quarter. "While I do not expect the pace to continue, the fact that real wages have accelerated recently is a good harbinger for the economy in 2007," said David Huether, chief economist of the National Association of Manufacturers. On the inflation front, the closely watched personal consumption expenditures price index fell 0.8 percent in the quarter, mostly because of falling energy prices. It was the biggest decline since the third quarter of 1954 when it dropped 1.2 percent and surprised economists, who were expecting gain of 1.9 percent. But excluding volatile food and energy prices, the core PCE index was up 2.1 percent, still slightly above the Fed's assumed comfort range of 1 percent to 2 percent, but below the 2.2 percent gain in the third quarter of 2006. Economists were expecting the core PCE index to rise 2.2 percent. "The numbers were good. They might be a little too good from the standpoint of the central bank, but the composition of growth is quite good," said Cary Leahey, senior managing director at Decision Economics in New York. For the year, GDP grew 3.4 percent after a 3.2 percent gain in 2005. Still, motor vehicle output restrained GDP sharply during the last quarter. Excluding motor vehicle production, GDP would have been up at a rate of 4.8 percent for the quarter. Spending on new home building slid at a rate of 19.2 percent during the quarter, as the housing market continued to weaken and by 4.2 percent for all of 2006. These were both the largest declines, respectively, since 1991. EMPLOYMENT COSTS UP SLIGHTLY A separate Labor Department report showed that employment costs -- another piece of the economy's pie that inflation-wary Fed officials are watching -- rose a less-than-expected 0.8 percent in the fourth quarter. The increase in the Employment Cost Index, a broad gauge of what employers pay in wages and benefits, eased from the third quarter's 1.0 percent gain and was below economists' forecast of a 1.0 percent increase, the data showed. Meanwhile, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported that applications for U.S. home mortgages increased last week, with both purchasing and refinancing activity picking up.
