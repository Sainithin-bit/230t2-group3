 MONTREAL  (Reuters) - Alcan Inc. AL.TO ( AL.N ) returned to profit it its fourth quarter on higher aluminum prices and by avoiding charges of the sort that caused a loss in the year earlier period, the company said on Wednesday. 


 Alcan, the world's second-largest maker of primary aluminum, said it earned $422 million, or $1.13 a share in the quarter. That compared with a loss of $361 million, or 98 cents a share, a year earlier, when the company took charges stemming from plant closures and write-downs. Analysts were looking for Alcan to earn $1.30 a share in the latest fourth quarter, before exceptional items, according to Reuters Estimates. Alcan said revenue rose to $6.22 billion from $5.05 billion, mainly because of higher aluminum prices and favorable pricing, products mix and volume in downstream businesses. Cash flow from continuing operations was a record $1.1 billion, compared with $788 million a year earlier.
