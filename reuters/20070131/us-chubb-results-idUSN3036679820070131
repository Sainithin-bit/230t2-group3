 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Chubb Corp. ( CB.N ), one of the largest U.S. business insurers, said on Tuesday earnings rose in the fourth quarter, helped by declining catastrophe payouts. 


 Chubb said net earnings were $654 million, or $1.56 a share, compared with $615 million, or $1.46 a share, in the same quarter the prior year. Chubb barely moved in aftermarket trading, edging down 9 cents to $52.63 from its close of $52.72 on the New York Stock Exchange. "Results were so good that they will be challenged to maintain even flat levels in 2007," said Jim Auden, an analyst with FitchRatings. Excluding realized gains and losses in the company's investment portfolio, Chubb's operating income was $614 million, or $1.46 a share during the quarter, up from $493 million, or $1.17 a share, a year earlier. Analysts had on average expected operating earnings of $1.35 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. In the past year Chubb's shares have risen 10.4 percent, compared with a 8.9 percent gain in the Standard & Poor's insurance index .GSPINSC. Chubb's market performance has attracted the attention of analysts, but not always favorably. Analysts have downgraded it, saying it has gotten too high. Net written premiums for the fourth quarter declined 4 percent to $3 billion. Losses on property and casualty insurance declined to $1.59 billion from $1.9 billion a year earlier as no major storm hit the United States in the latest year. Chubb's combined ratio, a measure of losses and expenses compared to premiums, fell to 83.1 percent from 89.3 percent in the year ago quarter. A lower combined ratio means that more premium income is flowing to the bottom line.
