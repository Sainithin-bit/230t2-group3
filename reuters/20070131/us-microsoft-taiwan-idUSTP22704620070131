 TAIPEI  (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. said on Wednesday it expects to sell twice as many copies of its new Vista PC operating system in its first year on sale compared with the launch of its last major upgrade, Windows XP, in 2001. 


 The growth would be roughly in line with the global PC market, which is also expected to nearly double in unit sales between 2001 and this year. "We are targeting a unit sales growth (for Vista) of two times Windows XP," Alex Huang, Microsoft's greater China regional director, told Reuters at its Vista launching ceremony for Taiwan. He added that Microsoft was also aiming to sell about five times as many copies of Vista as it did for Windows 95. Unit PC sales are expected to rise to 255 million units this year, nearly double the 136 million units shipped in 2001, according to IDC. Shipments in 1995, the year Windows 95 came out, totaled 59.7 million units. Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft called Vista the most important release of its dominant Windows operating system since Windows 95. It rolled out the new operating system in 70 countries on Tuesday, after several delays. Analysts still say that it will take time for the effect of Vista to be seen on the market. "The effect for PC sales won't be seen until the second half of this year, and we really don't need to make a big deal out of Vista, since consumers now are very rational," said Credit Suisse analyst Kevin Chang. Windows runs on more than 95 percent of the world's computers.
