 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. ( 4502.T ), 
Japan's largest drug maker, posted a strong 13.6 percent rise 
in nine-month profit on robust sales of its Actos diabetes drug 
and kept its full-year forecasts. 


  Despite early predictions of a tough year for Japanese drug 
makers on lower prescription prices and increased R&D spending, 
Takeda and others with drugs doing well in the United States 
have managed to push ahead with earnings growth.  Actos sales have been strong in the United States on 
reforms to the Medicare system, which extended care for the 
elderly, and on supply troubles with a competing product.  Japan's eighth-biggest company with a market value of 
nearly $58 billion stood by its full-year outlook for recurring 
profit of 540 billion yen ($4.44 billion), which analysts 
expect it to beat. A Reuters Estimates consensus estimate of 17 
brokers forecast 552 billion yen, up 17 percent from a year 
earlier.  April-December recurring profit -- before tax and 
extraordinary items -- rose to 475.69 billion yen ($3.91 
billion).  Nine-month sales rose 7.3 percent to 1.00 trillion yen.  With four patents on key products set to expire from 
2010/11, Takeda urgently needs to expand its pipeline, and the 
cash-rich company is expected to aggressively pursue licensing 
agreements and acquisitions.  The company has set aside 1 trillion yen ($8.2 billion) in 
cash for major investments, including acquisitions.  But analysts worry that the world's No. 15 drug maker is 
too cautious to pull the trigger on a major deal and isn't 
looking in the right places.  Takeda shares rose almost 22 percent in April-December, 
just beating a 20 percent gain on Tokyo's pharmaceutical sector 
sub-index .IPHAM.T.  ($1=121.51 Yen)
