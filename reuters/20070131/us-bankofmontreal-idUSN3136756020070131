 TORONTO  (Reuters) - Bank of Montreal ( BMO.TO ) said on Wednesday it will cut about 1,000 jobs and take a C$135 million ($115 million) charge in the first quarter as it tries to rein in costs to help meet its 2007 financial targets, a move that took analysts by surprise. 


 Canada's fourth-largest bank, whose large domestic retail banking operation reported an 11 percent drop in earnings in the fourth quarter, said most of the job cuts would take place this year and across all business sectors. The cost-cutting move was hailed by analysts but took some by surprise as revenue growth is seen as a bigger headache for the bank. "Costs are one element of the bottom line, but we believe the top line and market share challenges may be harder to deal with and could take several quarters, or more," said UBS analyst Jason Bilodeau in a note to clients. Frank Techar, the head of BMO's Canadian retail banking, said in November that the business continued to struggle to win deposits. BMO said in November it was targeting 5 percent to 10 percent growth in earnings per share in fiscal 2007 as well as a return on equity of 18 percent to 20 percent. The charge includes about C$117 million related to severance costs and C$18 million for non-employee linked costs. After taxes, the bank will take a charge of C$88 million. That is equal to about 12.5 percent of its fourth-quarter net income of C$696 million. BMO reports first-quarter earnings on March 1. Its chief executive, Tony Comper, will retire on that day, handing the reins to Chief Operating Officer Bill Downe. Bank of Montreal shares closed down 7 Canadian cents at C$70.01 on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Wednesday before the news was released. ($1=$1.18 Canadian)
