 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Google Inc. ( GOOG.O ) said on Wednesday it expects consumer use of Web search on mobile phones to grow substantially in 2007, but it does not see a financial impact from mobile search advertising until 2008. 


 "It's clear that 2007 will be the year that mobile search query traffic grows substantially," Google Chief Executive Eric Schmidt told investors on a conference call after the company reported fourth-quarter earnings. "You won't really see its financial impact until '08."
