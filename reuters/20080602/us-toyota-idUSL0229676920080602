 PARIS  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor ( 7203.T ) is considering downgrading its U.S. sales forecast to account for a worsening outlook for pick-up trucks and other big vehicles, the Financial Times newspaper said on Monday. 

 It quoted Toyota president Katsuaki Watanabe as saying he was not sure that increased sales of smaller cars and the Prius hybrid would make up for the decline in sales of sports utility vehicles and pick-up trucks. Senior Managing Director Takeshi Suzuki told reporters in May that Toyota's U.S. operations were working on revising the automaker's sales forecast for this calendar year, from 2.64 million vehicles, to reflect weaker industry demand. Watanabe said last month it would be difficult to expect a recovery in the U.S. economy this year. (Reporting by  Marcel Michelson  and  Chang-Ran Kim ; Editing by  Louise Ireland )
