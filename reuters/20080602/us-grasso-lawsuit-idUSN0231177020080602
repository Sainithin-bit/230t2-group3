 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The future of the long-running legal battle over former New York Stock Exchange chairman Richard Grasso's $187.5 million compensation package will be weighed by the state's highest court on Tuesday. 

 In arguments before the New York Court of Appeals in Albany, lawyers for the ex-exchange boss will argue that his pay was fair and he should be allowed to keep it. A representative for State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo will contend that the payout was too large and a big chunk of it should be returned. Grasso was forced out of the exchange in 2003 after a public outcry over his pay. He was sued in 2004 by then Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, who later become governor but resigned in March after a prostitution scandal. Cuomo's office has continued to pursue the civil lawsuit against Grasso. The seven-member appeals court is not expected to rule immediately. But whatever the court ultimately decides, it could help determine the scope of an eventual trial on Grasso's pay package in state court in Manhattan. A trial could be a showstopper for Wall Street, reliving an embarrassing drama for the NYSE. Potential witnesses could include U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and ex-Bear Stearns chairman James Cayne, who both had been members of the NYSE's compensation committee -- as well as possibly Spitzer. The appeals court will consider whether to reinstate four key legal claims against Grasso that were thrown out by a lower court in May 2007. In that ruling -- a big victory for Grasso -- a panel of judges ruled 3-2 that the attorney general lacked the authority to bring portions of the lawsuit, although it let two other parts of the case stand. Grasso, who ran the world's biggest stock exchange for eight years, headed the NYSE when it was a member-owned institution. It now is a publicly traded, for-profit company called NYSE Euronext Inc NYX.N. The Attorney General wants Grasso to return more than $100 million. Cuomo argues that recouping the money is in the public's best interest -- even though a state law governing not-for-profit companies does not specifically give him the power to seek such a payback -- and that the compensation package was not properly approved by the NYSE board. The Court of Appeals will consider on Tuesday whether Cuomo's office "may bring causes of action against Mr. Grasso that have not been expressly granted to the Attorney General by New York's not-for-profit corporation law," said Richard Marooney, a partner at law firm King & Spalding who is not involved in the case. While the attorney general's office can proceed on two of the six remaining claims regardless of what the court decides, "it just makes their case easier if these other four causes of action are in the case," Marooney said. The two remaining claims include contentions that Grasso knowingly received unreasonable compensation and that he neglected his fiduciary duties. Marooney said it is not surprising that the case has dragged on for four years. "That's just very typical litigation process," he said. "I think it just takes a really long time for lawsuits like this to wind their way through the courts." Cuomo's office had no comment on the case on Monday. A lawyer for Grasso, Gerson Zweifach, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. (Reporting by Martha Graybow, editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
