 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Futures contracts on leading U.S. stock market indexes were down around 0.5 percent before the start of Wall Street trading on Monday, ahead of the release of the ISM survey of manufacturing activity for May. 

 The Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) manufacturing index is due for release at 1400 GMT. "We will start in the red, and we could stay in the red if there is no sharp push from the ISM," said Heinz-Gerd Sonnenschein, equity strategist at Postbank in Germany. "The ISM has to go above 50 to give such a push," he said. Economists polled by Reuters expect a reading of 48.5, down from 48.6 in April. "A small decline in the manufacturing ISM ... is unlikely to shift the market view that the next move from the Fed will be up," Dutch bank ING said in a note, referring to the Federal Reserve, or central bank, which sets benchmark U.S. interest rates. "The corporate sector investment follows ISM new orders with a lag of 6 months, and this suggests that corporate investment is set to slow further," Credit Suisse said. "Corporations in the United States are intending to increase prices at close to a record rate in spite of slowing growth ... This may be supportive for (profit) margins, but has worrying implications for inflation and monetary policy," the Swiss bank said in a global equity strategy note. TIPPING POINT But Lehman Brothers said equity investors need not worry about higher interest rates as long as U.S. 10-year Treasury yields remain below a "tipping point" of 4.9 percent. "Unless and until yields rise to the tipping point, we would rather buy stocks in the knowledge that they will gain from 'reflationary' increases in bond yields than they are likely to lose from investor concerns about tighter policy to come or the negative implications of more expensive debt financing costs," Lehman Brothers said in a global equity strategy note. With inflation pressures, primarily from oil and food, and central banks' response in the spotlight, investors are likely to pay attention to Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart's speech on the economic and financial situation at 1620 GMT. One sign of the U.S. financial sector's health will be the outcome of the Fed's auction of $75 billion worth of 28-day credit via its Term Auction Facility (TAF) at 1400 GMT. Bank stocks were among the leading losers in Europe .SX7P on Monday, and Sonnenschein said he expected U.S. financials to weigh on Wall Street in the run-up to U.S. banks' earnings reports for the quarter to end-May later this month. Among top U.S. investment banks, Lehman Brothers LEH.N reports on June 12, Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) on June 16 and Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) on June 20. At 0935 GMT, Dow Jones futures were down 0.6 percent, S&P 500 futures had also lost 0.6 percent, while Nasdaq futures were down 0.4 percent. The indicative Dow Jones index .DJII, which tracks how the Dow stocks trade in Frankfurt, was 0.9 percent lower. No S&P 500 companies are scheduled to report results. On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  fell 0.1 percent, while the S&P 500  .SPX  gained 0.2 percent, and the Nasdaq  .IXIC  rose 0.6 percent. In May, the Dow fell 1.4 percent, while the S&P 500 rose 1.1 percent and the Nasdaq climbed 4.6 percent. (Editing by Will Waterman)
