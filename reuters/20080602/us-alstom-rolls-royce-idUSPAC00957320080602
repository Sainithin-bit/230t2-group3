 PARIS  (Reuters) - French engineering group Alstom on Monday denied a newspaper report it was mulling a tie-up with British aero engine and turbines group Rolls-Royce Plc ( RR.L ). 

 "There are no discussions, no talks, nothing," a spokesman said. "The story is groundless," he added. The Les Echos business daily said building closer ties with Rolls-Royce was one of the options being considered by Alstom in case it fails to tie up with French nuclear energy group Areva CEPFi.PA.
