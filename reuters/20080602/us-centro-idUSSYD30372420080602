 MELBOURNE  (Reuters) - Centro Properties Group CNP.AX, one of Australia's biggest casualties of the global credit crunch, won more time to repay about A$2.8 billion ($2.7 billion) in debt, as the group pursues asset sales to raise cash. 

 Centro, which owns about 700 U.S. shopping malls, predominantly in the east of the country, said it won a seven-month extension on its debt to December 15. The extension, the fourth granted to the firm, gives Centro time to find buyers for two of its funds. If the conditions had not been met it could have pushed the company into insolvency. Banks agreed this month to a loan extension in principle, but it was dependent on a number of conditions being met, including the banks agreeing to the process for refinancing or asset sales. BT Funds Management portfolio manager Peter Davidson said he expected buyers for the two funds to emerge in coming months, although the group's gearing levels remained a concern. "The trade-off that bankers are making is between waiting for credit markets to improve and hoping the economic downturn doesn't bite too hard," Davidson said. Shares in Centro briefly climbed 10 percent to A$0.42 on the news, but later retreated to trade lower. A year ago, the stock was trading at more than A$9. Centro, which has more than A$8.5 billion of syndicated funds under management in Australia, borrowed heavily last year to fund a rapid expansion in the United States, but ran into trouble when credit markets dried up and it was unable to refinance maturing debt. Centro is looking to sell its stake in two wholesale funds, Centro Australia Wholesale Fund (CAWF) and Centro America Fund (CAF), and says it has had expressions of interest in both. The Australian Financial Review reported last week that Centro was close to selling its interest in CAF, which has 32 U.S. mall assets worth A$1.2 billion, to a single party. Centro holds a 45.1 percent direct stake in the fund, and its managed funds own another 49.9 percent stake. Since Centro opened its books to suitors in February, media reports have cited U.S. private equity firm Blackstone Group ( BX.N ) and a unit of General Electric Co ( GE.N ) as potential buyers. EXTRA CREDIT LINE The extension to the A$2.8 billion in debt includes A$2.3 billion owed to the Australian banks and $450 million owed to U.S. private noteholders. Centro managed to finalize another A$155 million credit line to pay for capital spending, fees to advisers and cover higher borrowing costs, which had been one of the conditions for a fresh extension. The deal also triggers an extension to September 30 of A$2.5 billion of U.S. bank debt associated with Centro affiliate Centro Retail Trust ( CER.AX ), which had been subject to the Australian portion of debt winning an extension. Centro said on Monday the December 15 extension was subject to conditions, including its bankers agreeing on the terms of asset sales by September 30. Centro's main local bankers include Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd ( ANZ.AX ), Commonwealth Bank of Australia Ltd CBA.aX, National Australia Bank ( NAB.AX ) and St George Bank Ltd SGB.AX. The company's shares have fallen about 90 percent since it revealed the debt problems in December. They rose as high as A$0.42 in early trade but last traded down 4.0 percent at $0.365.
