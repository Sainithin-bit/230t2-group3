 (Reuters) - Hilton Hotels Corp has hired two senior executives from Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc ( HOT.N ), as part of a plan to nearly double its luxury properties over the next year, the Wall Street Journal said on Monday. 

 Ross Klein was hired as global head of luxury and lifestyle brands and Amar Lalvani as global head of luxury and lifestyle brand development, the newspaper said. At Starwood, Klein was president of the hotel chain's luxury brand group. Lalvani was senior vice president of development for luxury brands and global head of development for W, Starwood's boutique hotel chain. Hilton has a strong presence in budget and upscale sectors. Rivals Starwood and Marriott International Inc MAR.N have expanded in the more lucrative luxury space in recent years. Hilton went private last year after a $20 billion buyout by private equity firm Blackstone Group LP ( BX.N ). Hilton and Starwood did not immediately return calls seeking comment.
