 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Washington Mutual Inc ( WM.N ), a national bank and home lender struggling to rebound after heavy mortgage losses, said on Monday that it would strip Chief Executive Kerry Killinger of his title of chairman next month. 

 The Seattle bank said independent director Stephen Frank would succeed Killinger as chairman on July 1. For several months, shareholder activists took aim at Killinger and board members for not protecting the bank from crippling losses triggered by the housing slump and the collapse of mortgage markets. "This is a clear acknowledgment of the important failings by Killinger and the board in managing risk to shareholders," said Steve Abrecht, executive director of SEIU Master Trust, a union-affiliated fund that lobbied for the CEO-chairman split. Frank, 66, has been a director since 1997 and is the retired CEO of utility company Southern California Edison, a subsidiary of Edison International ( EIX.N ). The largest U.S. savings & loan reported a $1.1 billion first-quarter loss, triggered by its exposure to subprime mortgages, and was forced to sell a $7 billion stake to investors led by TPG Capital. WaMu's stock price has plunged 79 percent during the past year. WaMu said in April that it would consider splitting the CEO and chairman roles at a future board meeting. Stockholders and activists such as CtW Investment Group agitated for governance reforms changes at the bank. "We heard the feedback and the input from our shareholders. The board took that all into account," WaMu spokeswoman Libby Hutchinson said. The board meets later this month for a two-day session at which key issues such as strategy, dividends and cost-cutting will be under consideration. Merrill Lynch analyst Ken Bruce said while greater board independence could help to enhance performance, it will take years before WaMu can turn things around. "We estimate that (WaMu) will not profitable until the second half of 2009, as credit costs will likely weigh on its earnings power through 2012," Bruce wrote in a client note. He rates the shares "neutral." WaMu's board shake-up comes the same day Wachovia Corp WB.N said it had ousted Ken Thompson as CEO after a host of troubles and an ill-timed takeover of a big mortgage lender dragged down its earnings and its stock. Last month Wachovia, the fourth-largest U.S. bank, split its CEO and chairman roles. On Monday Lanty Smith, who replaced Thompson as chairman, was named interim CEO. Charlotte, North Carolina-based Wachovia said Thompson, who had run the company since April 2000, was retiring at the request of its board. Killinger and Thompson join a growing list of banking chiefs whose careers were derailed by the global credit crisis that began last summer. Citigroup Inc's ( C.N ) Charles Prince and Merrill Lynch & Co's MER.N Stanley O'Neal also were forced out by their boards. Further on Monday, Washington Mutual revised its rules so that director nominees must receive a majority of votes cast in uncontested elections. In addition, it changed the leadership of key board committees and announced a search for new independent directors. Mary Pugh, a director who chaired its finance committee, left the board in April. Spokeswoman Hutchinson said WaMu wanted to add up to two new independent directors, in particular seeking people with financial services backgrounds. Shares of Washington Mutual fell 10 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $8.92 in afternoon New York Stock Exchange trade. (Reporting by Joseph A. Giannone; Editing by Gerald E. McCormick and Lisa Von Ahn)
