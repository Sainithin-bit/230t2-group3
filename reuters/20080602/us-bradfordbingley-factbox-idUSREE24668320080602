 (Reuters) - Mortgage lender Bradford & Bingley BB.L warned on the prospects for the UK market on Monday and said it had slashed the price of its emergency cash call to attract a lifeline from a U.S. private equity firm, TPG Capital. 

 Following are five key facts about Bradford & Bingley (B&B): * A former building society formed in 1964 from the merger of the Bradford Equitable Building Society and the Bingley Building Society, B&B demutualized in July 2000 and listed on the stock exchange in December that year. Some 40 percent of the bank's shares are still held by retail investors. * In recent years, B&B has transformed itself into a specialist mortgage bank and is now Britain's largest buy-to-let lender, providing loans to landlords and property investors. It also provides "self-cert" mortgages, or loans for the self-employed and those with more than one job. * At its peak in March 2006, B&B was worth 3.3 billion pounds ($6.5 billion). The shares have since tumbled, losing 76 percent of their value since the start of this year alone. At current prices, the lender is worth around 400 million pounds. * The bank has been under pressure since May, when it announced plans for a bumper 300 million pound emergency rights issue, a month after denying it had any plans to do so. B&B said at the time that it had waited for markets to stabilize before going ahead with the deeply discounted issue. * Chairman Rod Kent, who resigned as chairman of Close Brothers ( CBRO.L ) on Monday, has taken on an executive role at the bank after its chief executive, Steven Crawshaw, stepped down on Sunday due to ill-health. Crawshaw joined the bank from Lloyds TSB ( LLOY.L ) just under a decade ago to lead its flotation and was behind the bank's shift to a focus on specialist loans. Crawshaw has also resigned as chair of the Council of Mortgage Lenders. Source: Reuters; www.bbg.co.uk; (Writing by Jijo Jacob, editing by David Cutler)
