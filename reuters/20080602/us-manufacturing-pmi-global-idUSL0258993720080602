 LONDON  (Reuters) - Global manufacturing activity recovered slightly in May but input prices hit a 10-year high as soaring energy costs continued to bite, a report showed on Monday. 

 The JP Morgan Global Manufacturing PMI, compiled with research and supply management organizations, rose to 50.4 in May from April's 50.2. This is just above the 50.0 mark that divides growth from contraction. "Growth in the manufacturing sector remained soft overall. Further declines in new business and employment also suggest that conditions are becoming increasingly tight," said David Hensley, director of global economics coordination at JP Morgan. The index comes after data showed U.S. factory activity contracted in May for the fourth consecutive month, but rose slightly from April, while the euro zone saw activity cool further as factory output remained at a near three-year low. Global input prices hit 76.3, the highest since the survey began in 1998, as soaring oil, energy, fuel and food prices all took their toll. The employment index fell to 49.3 from April's 49.6 as companies trimmed non-essential staff in subdued market conditions and to offset part of the rise in costs. The index combines survey data from countries including the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, China and Russia. (Reporting by  Jonathan Cable ; Editing by Gerrard Raven)
