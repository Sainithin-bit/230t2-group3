 LONDON  (Reuters) - World stocks began June on a negative note and sterling hit a one-week low versus the dollar on Monday after a slump in profits at UK bank Bradford & Bingley BB.L added to concerns about the financial sector. 

 Government bonds remained under pressure in major economies, with a sell-off sending some Japanese government borrowing rates to 10-month highs. A fall in oil prices -- now down nearly $10 a barrel from May record peaks -- gave support to Asian stocks. In an unscheduled trading update, the largest UK buy-to-let mortgage lender reported a near 50 percent year-on-year slump in profits for the first four months of 2008, scaled back a planned rights issue and announced a cash injection from a U.S. private equity firm. Bradford & Bingley's chief executive had quit on Sunday, less than a month after surprising investors with an emergency cash call. Its shares sank 25 percent on Monday. "It rekindles concerns over the banking sector, and we're probably going to see more asset writedowns in the market," said Chicuong Dang, equity analyst at Richelieu Finance. The FTSEurofirst 300 index  .FTEU3  fell 1.2 percent while MSCI main world equity index .MIWD00000PUS slipped 0.15 percent on the day. U.S. stock futures were down around half a percent, indicating a weaker open on Wall Street later. European banks .SX7P fell 1.9 percent to a fresh two-month low with UK banks such as HBOS HBOS.L and Alliance & Leicester ALLL.L falling between 7 and 10 percent at one point. European banks and cash strapped firms are expected to ask investors for a record $100 billion this year in the form of big rights issues. Banks have the biggest deals in the pipeline as they attempt to rebuild capital positions that have been hit by credit-related writedowns. POUND UNDER PRESSURE Sterling fell 1.2 percent to $1.9597, also coming under pressure after data showed the UK manufacturing sector stagnating and mortgage approvals tumbling to a record low. "It's hard to get much of an attraction to sterling at the moment," said Mitul Kotecha, head of FX research at Calyon. "We are going to get pieces of bad news like this (B&B), we know that not just UK banks but generally the financial sector troubles are not entirely over." Concerns over the banking sector pushed up the cost of borrowing three-month sterling funds LIBOR, with the premium of interbank rates over anticipated official rates widening. The cost of insuring European bank debt against default also rose after B&B news. The Markit iTraxx Senior Financials Index widened 5 basis points to 69.5 bps. The June Bund future turned positive after B&B news depressed stocks, trading up 24 ticks on the day. JGB SELL-OFF Growing inflation concerns and nervousness about investor demand for an upcoming auction pushed Japanese government bonds lower, increasing yields across the board. The two-year yield rose 2.5 basis points to a 10-month high of 0.930 percent, fully reflecting expectations for a quarter-point rate hike from 0.5 percent in the months ahead as well as the possibility of another. Government bond yields in the euro zone, Japan and the U.S. hit 2008 highs last week as investors unwound safe-haven trades they had put on during the worst phase of the credit crisis after strong U.S. data and higher euro zone inflation figures. U.S. light crude fell 1.3 percent to $125.73 a barrel. Gold rose on the day to $888.70 an ounce. Emerging sovereign spreads tightened 4 basis points while emerging stocks .MSCIEF were up 0.15 percent. (Additional reporting by  Blaise Robinson  and  Veronica Brown ; editing by  Keith Weir )
