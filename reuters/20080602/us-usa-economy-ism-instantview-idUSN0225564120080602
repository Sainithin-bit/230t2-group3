 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. factory activity contracted in May for the fourth consecutive month while inflation pressures surged to their highest since April 2004, according to a report released on Monday. 

 CONSTRUCTION SPENDING: U.S. construction spending fell 0.4 percent in April on continued deterioration in the residential sector, but outside of home building private spending rose for the third straight month, government data on Monday showed, pointing to some healthy spots in the building sector.  KEY POINTS:  ISM: * The Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity rose in May to 49.6 from April's 48.6. * Economists' median forecast was for a result of 48.5, according to a Reuters poll. The 90 forecasts in the survey ranged from 46.5 to 50.5. * A reading below 50 represents contraction in the factory sector. May was the fifth month of retrenchment in six months. * This year's manufacturing slump is the worst since 2003, when the ISM index spent five consecutive months below 50 from February to June that year.  CONSTRUCTION SPENDING: * Economists polled by Reuters ahead of the report were expecting a 0.6 percent decrease in construction spending after a 0.6 percent decrease in March that was first reported by the Commerce Department as a much bigger 1.1 percent decline. * Spending in the private sector on a range of structures from factories, lodging, offices, and power plants, rose 1.6 percent to a record annual rate. That was offset by private residential construction spending, which fell 2.3 percent for the 26th consecutive monthly decrease to an annual rate not seen since 2002.  COMMENTS: MICHAEL DARDA, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MKM PARTNERS LLC,  GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT: "It's more evidence that the economy is not falling off a cliff. This is consistent with an economy that's still expanding not one that's in recession. So things are soft but are not collapsing." "You have an inflation threat that's been there for a while. I think it has been enhanced by the Fed's easy monetary policy. So what we're looking at is growth plus inflation -- growflation. So right now things are a bit stagnant but I think by the end of the year we'll see an economy that's growing at a more normal pace but inflation is going to continue to be a thorn on the side." GARY THAYER, SENIOR ECONOMIST, WACHOVIA SECURITIES, ST.  LOUIS, MISSOURI: "The ISM manufacturing index was a little better than expected, but still showed that manufacturing contracted last month. Manufacturing has contracted in five of the past six months. It's not a dramatic decline, but it shows that domestic demand is weak while exports are lending some support." TONY CRESCENZI, CHIEF BOND MARKET STRATEGIST, MILLER, TABAK  & CO. IN NEW YORK: On ISM: "This figure shows that the depth and duration of the downturn is shallow thus far. This will be good for credit markets and for riskier assets like equities. This figure will reinforce the upward trend in Treasury yields because it shows the chance of further worsening of the negative feedback loop between the economy and credit markets is smaller now." BRIAN DOLAN, HEAD OF RESEARCH, FOREX.COM, BEDMINSTER, NEW  JERSEY: "It's encouraging for the dollar to an extent, though you have to keep manufacturing in perspective. But it's dollar positive news and gives the glass-half-full crowd something to hang on to. But I would note that the employment level in the ISM index remains steady at relatively depressed levels. The best we can say is that the weak dollar is still supporting manufacturing, but it's one bright spot in an otherwise gloomy picture."  MARKET REACTION: * BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices pared gains * CURRENCIES: U.S. dollar extended gains against the euro * STOCKS: U.S. equity indexes extended losses * RATE FUTURES: U.S. short-term interest rate futures dipped, pricing in a zero percent probability of a 25 basis point rate cut at the Fed's June meeting, compared with a 2 percent probability late Friday
