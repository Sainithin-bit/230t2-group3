 LONDON  (Reuters) - Police in London said they have arrested a 31 year old man on the suspicion of fraud in the early hours of Thursday, after Swiss bank UBS said one of its dealers had made a massive trading loss. 

 "A 31 year old man was arrested in Central London at 3.30am on suspicion of fraud by abuse of position," a City of London Police spokesman said. "He remains in police custody." A spokesman for UBS later confirmed a person who had made unauthorized trades resulting in a $2 billion loss had worked in London and had been arrested by police. (Reporting by  Douwe Miedema )
