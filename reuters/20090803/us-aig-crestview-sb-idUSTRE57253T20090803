 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - American International Group Inc is close to selling its asset management business to a consortium that includes private equity firm Crestview Partners for $300 million to $400 million, a source familiar with the matter said on Monday. 

 A deal for the business would come months after it was put on the market. AIG's unaffiliated client assets under management, including retail mutual funds and institutional accounts, were $63.5 billion as of March 31, down from $94.6 billion the previous year. AIG and Crestview declined to comment. The source was granted anonymity because talks are private. (Reporting by  Paritosh Bansal , Editing by Maureen Bavdek)
