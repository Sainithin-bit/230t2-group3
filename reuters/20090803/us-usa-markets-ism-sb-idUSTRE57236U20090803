 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. manufacturing sector continued to shrink in July but at a slower pace than the previous month, according to an industry report released on Monday. 

 U.S. construction spending beat expectations and rose 0.3 percent in June, with the spending rate for public buildings reaching a record high, the Commerce Department said on Monday. KEY POINTS: ISM * The Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity rose to 48.9 in July from 44.8 in June. The median forecast of 72 economists surveyed by Reuters was for a reading of 46.2. * A reading below 50 indicates contraction in the manufacturing sector. CONSTRUCTION SPENDING * Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending to fall 0.5 percent, after dropping 0.8 percent in May, which was originally reported as a decline of 0.9 percent. * Public construction gained by 1.0 percent to $321.75 billion, the highest on record. State and local construction also rose 1.0 percent to a record $295.79 billion, and federal building was up 1.9 percent. COMMENTS: JOHN SPINELLO, TREASURY BOND STRATEGIST, JEFFERIES & CO, NEW YORK: "ISM numbers were very impressive, up twice as much as expected, really pushing toward the 50 percent number. The components looked like they were fairly reasonable as well, production number up to 57.9, that's the highest in quite some time. The employment number increased 5 index points. Exports orders jumped over 50 as well, and imports hit 50 on the button. Everything was quite strong on the ISM numbers and surprisingly the construction spending was a positive, so that's reinforcing expectations that the recession is coming to an end and we will some see positive growth as we move into the second half of 2009. "It's the beginning of a trend. It's not surprising, the stock market as a discounting mechanism gave the sense that business was better. The recession had been very very deep so usually when you get a very deep recession you get a significant snap-back, and we're in the process of doing that right now. The bond market is down a bit, trading at the lows of the day, about 11 basis points higher than we saw on Friday after the very positive underwriting on Thursday which caused a lot of people to scramble to buy longer assets." GARY THAYER, SENIOR ECONOMIST, WELLS FARGO ADVISORS, ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI: "It was a good number. Production was above 50 for two months in a row. Inventory numbers remain relatively low so there could be some further improvement in production down the road as manufacturers try to prevent further declines in inventories. Businesses are now at the point where they have to avoid letting inventories get too low or they might not have any goods to sell."
