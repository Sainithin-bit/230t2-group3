 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Investment bank Goldman Sachs' ( GS.N ) reputation among both the general public and financially sophisticated Americans has been damaged by the events of the past year, the Financial Times reported on Sunday, citing research conducted for the paper. 

 The paper said a survey of 17,000 Americans by Brand Asset Consulting found that Goldman's stature had suffered in 2008 and 2009. While long-time rival Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) also suffered a decline in stature in the survey, respondents liked and respected Morgan Stanley more than Goldman, the paper said. The biggest U.S. investment bank has faced a torrent of unwanted publicity including an unflattering spread in Rolling Stone magazine, which accused the bank of having a key role in various market bubbles stretching back to the 1920s. Goldman was not immediately available for comment. (Reporting by  Megan Davies ; Editing by  Richard Chang )
