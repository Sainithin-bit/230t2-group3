 LONDON  (Reuters) - Barclays Plc ( BARC.L ) fell short of expectations with an 8 percent rise in half-year profit, as bad debts at Britain's second biggest bank almost doubled to offset record earnings for its enlarged investment bank. 

 IAN GORDON, ANALYST AT EXANE BNP PARIBAS "At the underlying level it looks quite strong. The big positive is capital, which is half a percent above market expectations. That's a key issue given the apparent market consensus that Barclays is still weak on capital. "I think that fairly powerfully disposes of that argument." MIKE TRIPPITT, ANALYST AT ORIEL SECURITIES. "The tangible book value is 313p after the BGI disposal and that gives the stock some valuation support. You have momentum in Barclays Capital and I think there is a strong earnings recovery story to come in Global Retail and Commercial Banking (GRCB), but not this year. "If you wanted to pick a little bit of a hole, Barclaycard's performance is driven largely by acquisitions and dollar strength. So the bears might (ask) what underlying income is doing." KEITH BOWMAN, ANALYST AT HARGREAVES LANSDOWN "Barclays' figures came in below estimates but have to be put in perspective. They're still up on last year... I think all the banking results will be complicated this week and will require delving into the finer points." SAM WRIGHT, TRADER AT SPREADEX "Despite Barclays' results missing headline expectations the market has focused on the strong balance sheet and good performance from the BarCap division, so shares are trading up."
