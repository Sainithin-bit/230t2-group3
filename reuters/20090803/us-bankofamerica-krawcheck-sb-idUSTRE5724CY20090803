 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp hired former Citigroup Inc executive Sallie Krawcheck to head its wealth management operations, making her a potential candidate to succeed Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis. 

 The question of a successor to Lewis loomed especially large on a day that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said Bank of America paid $33 million to settle charges it made false and misleading statements to investors about bonuses at Merrill Lynch, which it acquired January 1. Even before Monday, Lewis' stewardship of the No. 1 U.S. bank -- which has taken $45 billion in federal bailout money -- has been widely criticized. He lost his position as chairman of the board earlier this year, and the latest management shakeup raised new speculation that his days as CEO could be numbered. "These changes ... position a number of senior executives to succeed me at the appropriate time," Lewis, 62, said in a statement on Monday. The addition of Krawcheck, 44, to the executive management team as head of global wealth and investment management is an apparent coup for the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank and allowed the bank to change the subject from the SEC settlement. A former Citi chief financial officer and wealth management head, Krawcheck is one new candidate to replace Lewis along with four others internally, said a person familiar with the reshuffle, declining to comment publicly because he was not authorized to discuss the changes. "She figured out that this is a good ship to get on right now," said Robert Lutts, chief investment officer of Cabot Money Management in Salem, Massachusetts, which became a Bank of America investor again two weeks ago. Lutts said Krawcheck's hire and the broader management shuffle is a sign the bank is turning itself around. At Citigroup, Krawcheck had served as chief financial officer from 2004 until 2007, when she was made head of wealth management, a move some analysts considered a demotion. Once seen as a candidate to run all of Citigroup, she left last September after reported tension with CEO Vikram Pandit. But Krawcheck, who took home more than $12 million in cash and equity awards last year, remained one of the financial industry's highest profile women and the Wall Street Journal has recently reported UBS was in discussions to hire her. LEWIS' REPLACEMENT Although Bank of America's shares are now up 8.8 percent for this year, outperforming the wider banking sector, the shares fell to a low of $2.53 earlier this year and are still well below their $30 price before the bank first announced the controversial Merrill Lynch acquisition in September. The wider management changes also offer a handful of other candidates to succeed Lewis, the person said, mentioning former Merrill banking head Tom Montag, now responsible for global corporate and investment banking in addition to his role as head of global markets. Montag, an alumnus of Goldman Sachs Group Inc, has managed to hang on at Merrill despite the firing of former CEO John Thain, who lured him to the investment bank early during his tenure there. Brian Moynihan, previously head of the corporate and investment bank and now in charge of consumer banking, is also a candidate for the CEO job, along with Chief Financial Officer Joe Price and mortgage banking chief Barbara Desoer, the person said. The timeframe for finding a replacement for Lewis, is about two years, the person added. Separately, as part of the reshuffle, Liam McGee is leaving as head of consumer banking after almost 20 years at the bank and David Darnell, head of global commercial banking, will now report directly to Lewis and join the executive management team. Bank of America shares climbed 3.6 percent to close at $15.32 on the New York Stock Exchange, its highest close since December. (Reporting by Elinor Comlay; Editing by John Wallace,  Gary Hill )
