 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley intends to unveil on Monday a suite of proposed legislation to take on economic crime. 

 The proposals will include a new "enterprise crime" statute intended to make it easier to prosecute the heads of criminal organizations, as well as updates to the state's money- laundering and wire-tapping statues, said spokeswoman Emily LaGrassa. The laws would primarily target organized crime, rather than legitimate businesses that break laws, LaGrassa said. Coakley has scheduled a 1 p.m. briefing to discuss the proposals.
