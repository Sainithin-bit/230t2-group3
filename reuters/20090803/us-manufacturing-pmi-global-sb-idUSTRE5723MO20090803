 LONDON  (Reuters) - Global factory business activity stabilized in July as new orders and output recovered to levels not seen in well over a year, a survey showed on Monday. 

 The global index, produced by JP Morgan with research and supply management organizations, climbed to a 14-month high of 50.0 in July from 47.0 in June. The index had spent 13 months below the 50.0 mark that divides growth from contraction. "The rebound is likely to gain traction in the coming months, as the forward-looking orders-to-inventory ratio surged to a record high," said David Hensley, a director at JP Morgan. Meanwhile, the manufacturing output index climbed to an 18-month high as the new orders index reached a 20-month high. JP Morgan said the upturn was evenly balanced between developed and emerging markets in July. Earlier data showed the euro zone manufacturing sector edged closer to recovery while in the UK activity grew for the first time since March 2008. The U.S. manufacturing sector contracted at a far slower pace than expected last month, with the Institute for Supply Management's index for national factory activity jumping to 48.9 from 44.8 in June and smashing the median forecast for 46.2 by 72 economists polled by Reuters. The index combines survey data from countries including the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, China and Russia. (Reporting by  Jonathan Cable )
