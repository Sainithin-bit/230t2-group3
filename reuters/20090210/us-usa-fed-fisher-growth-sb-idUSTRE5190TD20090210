 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - Dallas Federal Reserve President Bank Richard Fisher said on Monday that he does not expect the U.S. economy to grow in 2009, and that "a lot hangs" on the impact of an economic stimulus package being debated by the U.S. Congress. 

 In remarks to reporters after a speech to an energy industry conference, Fisher declined to say if he expects China to buy more U.S. debt. (Reporting by  Chris Baltimore ; Editing by Leslie Adler)
