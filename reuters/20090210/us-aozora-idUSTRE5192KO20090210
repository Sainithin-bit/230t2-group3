 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Aozora Bank ( 8304.T ) warned on Tuesday that its annual net loss would widen to $2.1 billion, and it replaced its chief executive as it aims to forge a less risky strategy focused on commercial lending in Japan. 

 A mid-sized Japanese bank majority-owned by U.S. firm Cerberus Capital Management CBS.UL, Aozora has been hit by exposure to the subprime loan market and a string of soured investments including a $500 million bet on finance firm GMAC. Aozora, whose shares have fallen about 80 percent since it went public in 2006, said Federico Sacasa had stepped down as president and chief executive to take responsibility for the loss. He was replaced by Deputy President Brian Prince, who previously worked in Japan at Lehman Brothers and Shinsei Bank ( 8303.T ). "There are more needs for capital and lending in Japan than in the past," Prince told a news conference, adding that the bank would "pursue a profitable, Japan-focused business model." That could include an alliance with a local financial institution, the bank said, although it gave few specifics. Analysts have been skeptical whether Aozora can manage a real turnaround, given that it faces fierce competition from bigger rivals such as Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group ( 8306.T ) and Mizuho Financial Group ( 8411.T ). "Aozora has never had a convincing domestic strategy, and in the current environment it is difficult to envisage what niche they will occupy in the Japanese financial services industry," said Jason Rogers, a credit analyst at Barclays Capital. BIG LOSSES, BIG CHANGES Aozora said it now expects a group net loss of 196 billion yen ($2.14 billion) for the year to March 31, more than seven times bigger than the 27 billion net loss estimated in November. It will also not pay a dividend. The bank said it would boost domestic lending and aim to draw more than 50 percent of its funding from retail deposits, in order to reduce its dependence on the wholesale debt market. The credit crisis has made it too costly for many Japanese corporations to issue commercial paper, pushing them toward banks for funding. Aozora, which previously relied on debentures -- a type of bond -- for much of its funding, was forced to abandon its monthly issuance in October. While the bank has a relatively high Tier-1 capital ratio of 14.8 percent, Deputy President Kunimi Tokuoka said liquidity was a "weak point." Therefore, any alliance would likely be with a bank that had strong funding but needed to improve its capital base, he said. In returning its focus to the Japanese market, Aozora is following the strategy of its rival Shinsei. Shinsei, which expects a $535 million annual loss, has been looking to bulk up its domestic presence after several years of placing risky bets on overseas assets. Shinsei replaced its American CEO, Thierry Porte, in November with Japanese veteran Masamoto Yashiro, making Aozora the only major Japanese bank led by a Westerner. Both banks were previously nationalized and later sold to foreign funds. Both have yet to repay all the money they received in bailouts, making their poor performance a sour topic in Japan. Aozora wrote down its investment in GMAC buy an additional 36.4 billion yen. Only 3.2 percent, or 1.4 billion yen, of the original value remains on the bank's books. The bank also estimates 46 billion yen of losses on hedge funds, including exposure to Madoff Securities, as well as nearly 10 billion yen of exposure to Lehman Brothers. For April-December, the first nine months of Japan's business year, Aozora reported a net loss of 109.4 billion yen, compared with a net profit of 24.9 billion in the same period a year earlier. Aozora's shares lost about half their value during the October-December quarter, underperforming a 28 percent decline in Tokyo's index of bank stocks .IBNKS.T. The shares ended flat on Tuesday at 107 yen before the announcement, compared with a 1.3 percent rise in the bank index. (Editing by  Michael Watson )
