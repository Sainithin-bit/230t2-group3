 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - An $838 billion economic stimulus package cleared a key procedural hurdle in the U.S. Senate on Tuesday, paving the way for a quick vote on passage. 

 The Democratic-controlled Senate got the 60 votes needed to overcome procedural objections so that a final vote can now be held. Assuming the bill passes on the next vote, which is expected, the House and Senate will begin negotiating a final compromise bill.
