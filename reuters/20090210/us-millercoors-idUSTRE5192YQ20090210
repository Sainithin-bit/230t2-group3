 LONDON  (Reuters) - MillerCoors, the combined U.S. operations of Molson Coors Brewing Co ( TAP.N ) and SABMiller Plc ( SAB.L ), said on Tuesday fourth-quarter underlying net income rose 16.5 percent, as it accelerated its cost-savings targets. 

 MillerCoors, the second largest beer company in the U.S. with brands such as Miller Lite and Coors Light, reported net sales rose 3.1 percent to $1.74 billion with underlying net income rising to $135 million in the final quarter of 2008. The company, which was formed in July 2008, said profit growth was due to price increases, cost-cutting, and an acceleration of its cost-saving synergy targets. "While the U.S. beer category softened in the fourth quarter, we increased pricing and net revenue to deliver strong profit growth," said MillerCoors Chief Executive Officer Leo Kiely in a results statement. MillerCoors said it is well on its way to deliver its stated goal of $500 million of annual cost savings by the third year of combined operation, but the timing to achieve its original goal of $50 million in savings in the first 12 months has accelerated and it now expects to realize $128 million by end-June 2009. Molson Coors is due to report later on Tuesday. (Reporting by  David Jones )
