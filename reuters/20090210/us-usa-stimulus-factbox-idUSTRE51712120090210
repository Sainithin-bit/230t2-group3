 (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives has passed its economic stimulus plan and the Senate agreed to end debate on Monday and vote on Tuesday on its version. 

 In the end, a joint bill will likely pass both Democratic-controlled chambers for President Barack Obama to sign despite minimal Republican support. Here's what's involved for now: THE SENATE * The Senate voted 61-36 to wrap up debate on a bill now totaling $838 billion after whittling it down from $937 billion. The cost does not include government interest payments on the borrowed money. *Tax provisions total $284.6 billion with the remaining approximately $553.6 billion in spending and other provisions, according to estimates from the Congressional Budget Office (figures approximate because of rounding). * Some 78 percent of the package would go out the door within the first two years, just above the 75 percent President Barack Obama had demanded. * Here are some of the bigger reductions favored by Senate Democrats and a handful of fellow Republicans. - $40 billion from the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund which was meant to help states plug growing budget gaps. - $16 billion for school construction. - $5.8 billion for the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund, which pays for items such as grants for disease prevention as well as immunization programs. - $2 billion for health information technology efforts such as computerizing health records. * Here are a few of the bigger provisions that senators agreed to keep in the package. The Congressional Budget Office has not released updated cost estimates. - $139.8 billion in income tax credits, up to $500 for individuals and up to $1,000 for families. - A one-year fix to the Alternative Minimum Tax to shield middle-class taxpayers from paying a tax originally intended only for the wealthiest taxpayers. This provision alone costs almost $70 billion, but is not included in the House bill. - About $43 billion to extend and expand unemployment benefits and to make them tax free for 2009. - Up to $35.5 billion for expanding for one year a tax credit for first-time homebuyers to all purchasers of principal residences. It would boost the credit as high as $15,000, or 10 percent of the home price, whichever is less. The cost could be less depending on how it is officially calculated. - Approximately $17.2 billion that permits companies to write off current losses against previous tax years for up to five years, but does not apply to those who received aid from the $700 billion financial bailout. Current law only allows a two-year carryback. - $11 billion in tax incentives aimed at boosting U.S. car sales, which have been plunging. Interest payments on loans would be tax deductible for new cars bought from November 12, 2008, through 2009, as well as state and local sales taxes. THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES * The House passed the Democratic version of the legislation without any support from Republicans. The $819 billion includes, in figures that are rounded up: - $358 billion in emergency spending on construction projects and other investments aimed at creating jobs. It also includes a boost in federal investment in education and an expansion of food aid programs. - $275 billion in temporary tax cuts for workers, tax incentives to produce renewable energy and breaks for builders and other companies that would be allowed to write off current losses against five previous tax years. - $48 billion to help unemployed people keep their health insurance and to invest in health information technology. - $46 billion for expanded unemployment benefits and aid to needy families and child support. - $100 billion that includes money to improve broadband Internet access, invest more in clean energy and energy efficiency. It also has about $87 billion to help states pay increasing Medicaid health insurance costs for the poor. STILL TO COME * The Senate will vote around 12:00 p.m. EST on Tuesday to pass the legislation. * If and when the Senate passes the bill, House and Senate negotiators would meet to work out differences this week. * Democrats hope final votes on a completed bill would be held quickly, with Obama signing it into law shortly thereafter.
