 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The United States will not soon get out of the financial crisis, the worst in decades, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said Tuesday. 

 "We are going to keep at it until we fix it," Geithner said on CNBC. The new Treasury chief called the current crisis "enormously complicated." "It's going to take a lot of time to resolve," he said, adding that the government cannot solve it alone and will need to bring both private and public funds to the effort. Geithner earlier unveiled a revamped financial rescue plan to cleanse $500 billion in spoiled assets from banks' books and support $1 trillion in new lending through an expanded Federal Reserve program.
