 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner on Tuesday said the Treasury was exploring a range of structures for a public/private investment fund that could eventually soak up $1 trillion of distressed assets from American financial institutions. 

 In prepared testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, Geithner said he would seek input from the panel in designing both the asset fund and a housing plan that aims to prevent affordable foreclosures and reduce mortgage interest rates. Geithner said the investment fund, announced earlier on Tuesday, "will provide government capital and government financing to help leverage private capital and get private markets working again. This fund will be targeted to the legacy loans and assets that are now burdening many financial institutions." (Reporting by  David Lawder )
