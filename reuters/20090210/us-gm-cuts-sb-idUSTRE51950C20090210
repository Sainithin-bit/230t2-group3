 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp said on Tuesday it was slashing jobs and cutting pay in another round of cost cutting ahead of a February 17 deadline to submit a new restructuring plan mandated under a $13.4 billion U.S. government bailout. Chrysler LLC, which took $4 billion in federal funding, faces the same deadline. 

 Here are key facts about recent job cuts by GM, Ford Motor Co and Chrysler as the three Detroit automakers contend with plunging sales in their home market. * GM says it will cut 14 percent of its global salaried employment from 73,000 to about 63,000. About 3,400 of GM's 29,500 salaried employees in the United States will be cut as part of the move. Executives will have their pay reduced 10 percent, and other employees will see pay cuts of 3 percent to 7 percent. * GM is currently offering buyout packages -- $20,000 in cash and $25,000 voucher to buy a vehicle -- to all 62,000 U.S. factory workers as an incentive to retire or leave the company. * In 2008, GM cut its total North American work force 11.5 percent to 123,000, the smallest percentage decrease of the Detroit-based automakers. * Ford has cut more than 60,000 jobs in North America since 2005, including 13,200 salaried positions.
