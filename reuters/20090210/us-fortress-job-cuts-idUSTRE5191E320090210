 (Reuters) - Fortress Investment Group LLC ( FIG.N ), one of the few publicly traded managers of private equity and hedge funds, cut 11 percent of its workforce in the fourth quarter, the Wall Street Journal said, citing a person close to the matter. 

 The New York private-equity and hedge-fund company had reduced its workforce from 900 at the end of September to about 800, mainly in the last two months of 2008, the person told the paper. Other people told the paper that some teams based in Fortress offices outside the United States have been cut by up to 25 percent. Fortress could not be immediately reached for comment by Reuters.
