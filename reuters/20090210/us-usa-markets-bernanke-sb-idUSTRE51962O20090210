 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve believes an array of extraordinary programs aimed at stabilizing credit and banking have improved market conditions and eased strains despite a drumbeat of negative economic news, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Tuesday. 

 KEY POINTS: * "We have been encouraged by the responses to these programs," Bernanke said in testimony prepared for delivery to the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee. * Aggressive efforts by the Fed and other central banks in response to the deep financial crisis of the last 18 months have helped reduced interbank lending rates internationally and took some of the steam out of liquidity pressures at the end of 2008, he said. COMMENTS: T.J. MARTA, MARKET STRATEGIST, MARTA ON THE MARKETS, SCOTCH PLAINS, NEW JERSEY: "What I am extracting from Bernanke's comments is that the government is willing to take a variety of steps because this situation has spread so far beyond one actor or group of actors. Resolving this situation will take a variety of policy steps. It is no small feat that policymakers have avoided a complete catastrophe." MATT ESTEVE, FOREIGN-EXCHANGE TRADER, TEMPUS CONSULTING, WASHINGTON: "The actual main factor for the dollar gaining on the euro is the fact that stocks are down almost 300 points. It's a resurgence in risk aversion. I really do think that theme continues to dominate trade here. You see the dollar gain after both Treasury Secretary (Tim) Geithner and (Ben) Bernanke spoke. The market is clearly afraid of what they said. All the major officials in the U.S. basically said that our economy is suffering through a deep contraction. That's obviously weighed on stocks today and that has bolstered the dollar as a safe-haven asset. "From Bernanke perspective, his comment that the ample liquidity from the Fed is no panacea shows that obviously despite the Fed dumping billions of dollars of liquidity into the system, it's not going to be a quick fix. That's really what has turned sentiment south a little bit here in the last 10 minutes or so." HUGH JOHNSON, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, JOHNSON ILLINGTON ADVISORS: "What he says is it's fairly straightforward. Probably the most important thing that he says is the Federal Reserves' liquidity expansion in not a panacea. It has to some extent been successful but it has not been 'the answer.' He's quite right. Until the economy starts to expand, banks are going to be reluctant to make loans. Banks don't like having performing loans become non-performing loans. He's absolutely right that the Fed has done it's part to add liquidity to the financial system or strengthen the system or increase lending, but that's not all that is needed. The demand for loans needs to improve. I don't know if there is anything remarkable about what he says. The Federal Reserve can only take us so far." KURT KARL, HEAD OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH AND CONSULTING, SWISS RE, NEW YORK: "The comments are pretty straight forward. Of course it doesn't reassure the market. It is not terribly revealing. It does not look like there is any new information here." MEG BROWNE, CURRENCY STRATEGIST, BROWN BROTHERS HARRIMAN, NEW YORK: "(Ben) Bernanke hasn't said anything yet that is new. The options to buy Treasuries remain open, but he didn't mention it. The forex market is jumping a bit on this because not only did investors seem determined to bring the euro down, with his comments out of the way, investors can focus on the medium and long term. This is going to be it for the day." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. equity indexes hold losses. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices hold gains. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar extends gains versus euro.
