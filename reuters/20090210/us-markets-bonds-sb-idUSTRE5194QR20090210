 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. Treasuries extended gains on Tuesday in safe-haven bidding as stocks fell to fresh lows after Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner unveiled a financial plan meant to clean up spoiled assets from banks' books and support new lending. 

 Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes were trading 30/32 higher in price for a yield of 2.88 percent compared with 2.98 percent late on Monday, while the two-year note was 1/32 higher for a yield of 1.00 percent. (Reporting by  Chris Reese ; Editing by  Chizu Nomiyama )
