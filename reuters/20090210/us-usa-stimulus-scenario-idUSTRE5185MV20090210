 (Reuters) - Here's a rundown of what's next for President Barack Obama's economic stimulus package making its way through Congress this week: 

 * The Senate is expected to vote around 5:30 p.m. EST on Monday to force the end of debate on its version of the stimulus package. Obama's fellow Democrats, who control the Senate with 58 seats, need 60 votes to end debate and have the support of at least three Republican senators. * The Senate on Tuesday is expected to vote on an amendment to slim down its version to roughly $827 billion from $937 billion. It is expected to pass with support from Republican Senators Susan Collins, Arlen Specter and Olympia Snowe. * If the Senate approves the overall legislation, most likely on Tuesday, it needs to be reconciled with a version that passed the House of Representatives with an $819 billion price tag. Party leaders appoint a few lawmakers from each chamber to resolve the differences. * Lawmakers have to sort through scores of differences -- from spending priorities to tax cuts and incentives -- and the process could take several days or longer. Congress is under pressure to meet a February 16 target Obama set. * Amid the votes and negotiations, Obama was traveling to two cities hit hard by the ailing economy -- Elkhart, Indiana, on Monday and Fort Myers, Florida, on Tuesday -- to seek support for the measure. * If and when lawmakers reach a compromise, the House and Senate vote again on the final version before it is sent to the president for his signature or veto.
