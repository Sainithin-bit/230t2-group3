 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc ( BRKa.N ) ( BRKb.N ) has further slashed its stake in Constellation Energy Group Inc CEG.N after backing away from a possible bidding war for the company. 

 In a Monday filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Berkshire's MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co unit said it has reduced its stake in Constellation to about 14.83 million shares, or 7.45 percent, from 17.22 million shares, or 8.65 percent, as of January 22. Berkshire had earlier in January sold an additional 2.67 million Constellation shares, a separate SEC filing shows. Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire got about 20 million Constellation shares plus $593 million in cash as a termination fee when Constellation on December 17 rebuffed a $4.7 billion takeover offer. Constellation instead agreed to sell nearly half of its nuclear power business to Electricite de France SA ( EDF.PA ) for $4.5 billion. Shares of Constellation shares closed Monday down 50 cents at $26.40 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel)
