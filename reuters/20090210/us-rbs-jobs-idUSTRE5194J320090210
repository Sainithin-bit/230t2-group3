 LONDON  (Reuters) - The Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc ( RBS.L ) could cut up to 2,300 jobs in Britain or around 2 percent of its local workforce of 106,000, the bank said in a statement on Tuesday. 

 The lay-offs will not affect customer-facing staff, RBS added. "We will be consulting with our recognized trade union, Unite, and our employees throughout. We fully agree with Unite that we must keep compulsory redundancies to a minimum and we will," said UK Chief Executive Alan Dickinson. Earlier on Tuesday, Unite members stood outside the entrance to a meeting of parliamentarians and former senior banking executives, including two from RBS, and held placards saying: "Remember us? You've put our jobs at risk." Prior to these latest lay-offs, RBS slashed around 3,950 jobs across the group since August 2007. (Reporting by  Steve Slater  and  Olesya Dmitracova )
