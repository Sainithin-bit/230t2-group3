 NEW DELHI  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) sees production improving in the second quarter but a market recovery will take time, a senior company official said on Tuesday. 

 "Specifically talking about the U.S. production which has been at a very low level in the first quarter, will come back up to some degree," Jonathan Browning, head of global sales, told reporters in the Indian capital. "Don't interpret that as a recovery underlying demand. Just a question of balancing inventory and going through a period of very lean production ... it's not a market recovery," he said.
