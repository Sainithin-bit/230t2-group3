 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - U.S. antitrust authorities confirmed on Tuesday they reached an accord with Microsoft Corp. requiring the company to modify its Vista operating system in response to complaints its desktop search function puts Google Inc. ( GOOG.O ) and other potential competitors at a disadvantage. 

 The Justice Department said Microsoft ( MSFT.O ) would create a "mechanism" for computer users and manufacturers to select a default program to handle desktop search.
