 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Xcel Energy ( XEL.N ) said on Wednesday it reached a tentative settlement with the U.S. government related to a tax dispute over its life insurance policies. 

 Xcel said it would pay the Internal Revenue Service $64.4 million, or about $56 million after taxes, to settle all the government claims between 1993 to 2007 over corporate-owned life insurance policies purchased on the lives of Xcel's Public Service Company of Colorado employees. As a result of the proposed settlement, the company expects to record a loss ranging from about $35 million to $45 million in 2007. Xcel now sees 2007 earnings of $1.20 to $1.32 per share. Analysts had, on average, expected the company to earn $1.42 per share in 2007.
