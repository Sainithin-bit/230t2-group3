 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Chrysler Group said on Wednesday it plans to add about 100 new dealerships in established markets such as Western Europe over the next two years, as it focuses on expanding sales outside North America. 

 The automaker, which has been losing market share in the United States, said it plans to double last year's sales outside North America to about 400,000 units in the next five years. Sales outside North America currently account for about 8 percent of the company's total sales. The automaker is looking to grow overseas as it struggles with U.S. sales amid high gasoline prices, a weak housing market and tough competition from Asian rivals. Its U.S. sales fell 2.2 percent through May this year. Chrysler said about 70 international investors and dealers were visiting the company's headquarters in Auburn Hills, Michigan, this week to learn about the potential for franchises in their respective markets. "It is important that we expand in other markets so that we are not as dependent on the ups and downs of a single region," Chrysler Group Chief Executive Tom LaSorda said. In 2006, Chrysler expanded the availability of its Dodge line in key markets all over the world with the launch of the Caliber. The next two Dodge vehicles, being introduced globally this summer, are the Dodge Nitro and Avenger. By 2009, Dodge could account for about 30 percent of the company's international sales, Chrysler said. Chrysler, which lost almost $1.5 billion last year, has said it was aiming to return to profitability by 2008 as part of a turnaround plan that includes cutting about 13,000 jobs. The company, which was part of German automaker DaimlerChrysler AG DCXGn.DE, is being taken private by Cerberus Capital Management in a $7.4 billion deal.
