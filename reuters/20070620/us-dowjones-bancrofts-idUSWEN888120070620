 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Dow Jones & Co. Inc. DJ.N said on Wednesday that its board will take over discussions over News Corp.'s NWSa.N $5 billion bid to buy the company. 

 The board and the Bancroft family concluded that this would be the "best way" to evaluate the proposal as well as other alternatives, including staying independent. Bancroft family representatives said that any transaction must include appropriate provisions to maintain the editorial independence of Dow Jones's news operations.
