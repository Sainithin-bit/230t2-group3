 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Private equity firm Blackstone Group BG.UL is in talks to buy a 30 percent stake in China National BlueStar (Group) Corp.'s chemicals business for about US$500 million, a Hong Kong newspaper reported on Wednesday. 

 BlueStar, which is a subsidiary of the country's largest chemical maker China National Chemical Corp., holds stakes in domestically listed BlueStar Cleaning, BlueStar New Chemical Material ( 600299.SS ) and Shenyang Chemical Industry 000698.SZ, the South China Morning Post said. The talks were still at an early stage, the newspaper quoted market sources as saying. New York-based Blackstone is making a big push into China to catch up with rivals. The report comes after the Chinese government agreed to take a US$3 billion stake in Blackstone, sealing a key alliance with the company at a time when foreign investors are struggling to gain support from Beijing to buy domestic assets.
