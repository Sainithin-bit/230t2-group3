 ZURICH  (Reuters) - Shares in Swiss chemical groups Clariant ( CLN.VX ) and Ciba CIBN.VX rose strongly in morning trade after the head of U.S. peer Huntsman Corp ( HUN.N ) expressed interest in buying the groups. 

 Clariant stock rose 2.2 percent by 0914 GMT while Ciba shares were 2.8 percent stronger, the strongest gainers among Swiss blue chips and outperforming a 1.1 percent higher DJ Stoxx European chemicals index .SX4P. On Tuesday, Huntsman Chief Executive Officer Peter Huntsman was quoted as saying by Swiss weekly newspaper Handelszeitung he was keen on buying the groups, or part of the groups, provided they were for sale. "Clariant and Ciba clearly are higher because of the Handelszeitung interview," one trader said. "But definitely, Akzo's ( AKZO.AS ) bid for ICI ICI.L is also playing a large role. Analysts have adjusted their spread-sheets for the sector because of the offer," he said. Britain's ICI earlier this week rejected Akzo's 7.2 billion pound ($14.32 billion) bid from Dutch chemicals group Akzo Nobel NV, saying it undervalued its business. Merger speculation has been swirling around Clariant and Ciba as specialty chemicals companies have been hard hit by higher raw material costs and increasing competition from low-cost producers in Asia. A Clariant spokesman said the company had not received a takeover offer and that its strategy was based on independence. Ciba declined to comment on the offer, saying its chances of staying independent were good. A deal between Huntsman and the two companies seemed unlikely, analysts said, as the industry increasingly moves toward Asia, while splitting companies up was often hard because work-flows of separate units are often heavily interdependent. German chemicals group Lanxess ( LXSG.DE ) was mentioned last month as a possible suitor for Clariant, boosting its shares. Lanxess at the time declined to comment. Ciba last year sold its Textile Effects unit to Huntsman for some 330 million Swiss francs ($266.1 million).
