 PHILADELPHIA  (Reuters) - Home improvement retailer Home Depot Inc. ( HD.N ) said on Wednesday it decided to repurchase $22.5 billion in stock and risk a lower credit rating instead of maintaining its current capital structure. 

 Home Depot said it weighed several options as it auctioned its HD Supply business and examined its balance sheet. The buyback would be funded from proceeds of the $10.3 billion sale of HD Supply, as well existing cash and new debt, the company said. "We discovered that our business model could support more financial leverage," Carol Tome, Home Depot's chief financial officer, told investors and analysts on a conference call. "While we believe it is important to maintain a strong investment-grade rating, holding onto our current rating would mean a lower capital distribution for our shareholders and we don't think we need to leave that money on the table," Tome said. Fitch Ratings on Wednesday cut Home Depot's debt rating by two notches. On Tuesday, debt-rating agencies Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service said they may cut Home Depot's credit rating by several notches due to the stock repurchase plan. Share repurchases typically boost share prices but weaken credit quality because less cash is available for debt repayment. The buyback plan would result in a more highly leveraged company at a time when operating trends have been weak, Fitch said. Still, Home Depot has a strong market position as the largest home improvement retailer and generates strong cash flow, Fitch said. Shares of Home Depot gained $2.53, up 6.6 percent, to $40.80 in Wednesday afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was the second most-actively traded stock. Spreads on Home Depot's 5.875 percent bonds due 2036 widened by 4 basis points to 146 basis points over Treasuries on Wednesday, according to MarketAxess. Spreads on those bonds had widened by 18 basis points on Tuesday.
