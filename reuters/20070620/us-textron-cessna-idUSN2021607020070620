 LE BOURGET, France  (Reuters) - Business jet maker Cessna Aircraft Co., a unit of Textron Inc. ( TXT.N ), said on Wednesday it booked an order for 96 Citation business jets from plane-sharing firm NetJets worth more than $1 billion. 

 The deal is a boost for Cessna, which is on track to hit record orders and deliveries of its business jets this year. The boom in business jet sales is not yet over, Cessna's chief executive said on Wednesday at the Paris Air Show, where the company unveiled the NetJets order. "They called it too early," said Cessna CEO Jack Pelton, describing industry comments last year that the business jet boom would peak in 2006. Cessna was still seeing "very strong order intake," he added. Cessna took in a record 496 business jet orders last year and with 127 already booked in the first quarter plus the new NetJets order, the firm is likely to beat that tally in 2007. It is also on track to beat its record in terms of deliveries this year, with 375 expected. That will hit 400 deliveries next year, Pelton said. NetJets, a unit of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. ( BRKa.N ) which sells part shares in jets, is Cessna's biggest customer.
