 PHILADELPHIA  (Reuters) - Home improvement retailer Home Depot Inc. ( HD.N ) on Wednesday said it would give stock grants to its 10,000 assistant store managers as it tries to improve employee performance and customers' shopping experience. 

 The grants for restricted shares, which will vest four years after the award date, will be distributed based on the job performance of the assistant managers, the company said. The value of the stock grants will total about $50 million, the company said in a conference call with analysts and investors. Home Depot on Tuesday set plans to repurchase $22.5 billion in stock and sell its HD Supply business to three private equity firms. Shedding the supply business will allow Home Depot to focus on its core retail operations. Home Depot operates 2,184 stores worldwide and employs about 364,000 workers.
