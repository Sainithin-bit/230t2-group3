 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc. ( VZ.N ) said on Wednesday it has nearly 500,000 subscribers to FiOS television, a video service that the U.S. phone company delivers over a high-speed, all-fiber network. 

 The subscriber total was up from 348,000 at the end of the first quarter, showing that FiOS is steadily making progress in competing against cable providers' all-in-one packages of television, Internet and phone services. Verizon, at the NXTcomm communications conference in Chicago, also said it has signed up 1 million subscribers to the FiOS Internet service since launching it in August 2004. Not all FiOS Internet users have the video service, partly because the company has not yet gained video licenses in some areas. FiOS TV offers multiple high-definition programs, digital video and music channels, and video on demand. Verizon plans to invest $23 billion from 2004 through 2010 to build the FiOS network and make the service available to 18 million homes by the end of 2010. Verizon's "fiber to the premise" plan is more expensive than rival AT&T Inc.'s ( T.N ) strategy, which makes use of existing copper lines between homes and neighborhood nodes, but the company has said it was crucial to handling high Internet traffic. Chief Executive Ivan Seidenberg said in a speech that bandwidth requirements were on the rise amid growing demand for Web-based video. "A single video requires 1,000 times the bandwidth of an audio file," he said. "High definition video requires over 10 times the bandwidth of regular video."
