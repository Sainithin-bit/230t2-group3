 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc. ( YHOO.O ) said it signed agreements with six mobile operators across Asia, as part of a broad global expansion that will see its mobile services in tens of millions of phones by the end of the year. 

 The six deals in Asia represents a combined subscriber base of nearly 100 million. Yahoo's oneSearch service lets users download e-mails, search the Internet, view Web pictures and check weather conditions. Internet companies Yahoo, Google and Microsoft see offering its products on cell phones as one of the most important sources of future growth as subscribers climb globally. The operators that will offer Yahoo's mobile search service are Globe Telecom in the Philippines, Idea Cellular Limited in India, LG Telecom in Korea, Maxis Communications Berhad in Malaysia, PT Telekomunikasi Selular in Indonesia and Taiwan Mobile. Yahoo, whose co-founder Jerry Yang replaced former Hollywood chieftain Terry Semel as Yahoo chief executive on Monday, said it will begin offering local language mobile services in 13 countries. Other countries earmarked for expansion include France, Germany, and Spain. A version of Yahoo's mobile software has been available free to download in the United States since January.
