 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A federal appeals court let stand a ruling on Wednesday that reinstated a lawsuit challenging a Novartis AG ( NOVN.VX )( NVS.N ) patent on the genital herpes drug Famvir. 

 The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit denied a Novartis request to review the reinstatement of the patent challenge by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. TEVA.O  ( TEVA.TA ). The appeals court, in a brief notice on its Web site, said it turned down a Novartis request to have a panel of judges rehear a March ruling in Teva's favor. Teva spokeswoman Denise Bradley said the company had no comment. A Novartis spokeswoman could not immediately be reached. In March, the appeals court reversed a lower court ruling and reinstated a patent suit filed by Teva against Novartis over Famvir, known generically as famciclovir. Teva filed an application with the Food and Drug Administration in 2004 to sell a generic version of Famvir. Novartis later filed suit alleging Teva had infringed one of its five patents on the drug. Teva sought to challenge all five patents, but a lower court threw out its suit related to the four patents for which Novartis did not sue. (Reporting by  Lisa Richwine )
