 LONDON  (Reuters) - U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. LEH.N said on Wednesday it plans to raise $500 million for its fund that invests in private equity firms in an Amsterdam flotation planned for late July. 

 Such alternative investment vehicles have gained in popularity on public markets this year, with IPOs of hedge fund Fortress Investment Group ( FIG.N ) and private equity firm Blackstone Group, among others. Lehman Brothers Private Equity Partners Ltd. plans to issue a single class of U.S.-dollar-denominated shares at $10 each on Euronext Amsterdam. Conditional dealing is expected to start July 18 and unconditional dealings July 25. The parent company will be the largest single investor by subscribing to $100 million of shares, which will be subject to a three-year lock-up. The bank's private fund investments group manages $6.5 billion and has generated an internal rate of return of 18.1 percent net of fees and expenses since 1987.
