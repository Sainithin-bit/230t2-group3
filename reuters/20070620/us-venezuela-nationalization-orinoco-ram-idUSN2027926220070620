 ARRECIFE, Venezuela  (Reuters) - A sizable group out of the six foreign oil majors negotiating with Venezuela the nationalization of multibillion dollar projects are about to sign deals, the OPEC member's energy minister said on Wednesday. 

 Energy Minister Rafael Ramirez also said he expected negotiations to end this week, bringing forward by a few days a deadline the government set for the takeover of their four heavy-crude upgrading investments in the Orinoco oil belt. "We are going to make the announcements this week," Ramirez said in an interview during an event near the Venezuelan coast celebrating a nationalization in the electricity sector. "The process has not finished. We are negotiating. There is an important group of companies that is on the point (of signing)," he said. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has ordered a group of six global energy oil giants to give the government a majority stake in the Orinoco Belt projects as part of a nationalization drive toward his self-described socialist revolution. The targeted companies in projects valued above $30 billion and capable of producing around 600,000 barrels per day are Exxon Mobil ( XOM.N ), ConocoPhillips ( COP.N ), Chevron Corp. ( CVX.N ), Norway's Statoil ( STL.OL ), Britain's BP Plc ( BP.L ) and France's Total ( TOTF.PA ). ConocoPhillips and Exxon are having the toughest talks over whether they stay in the projects, where the government wants to increase its stake to at least 60 percent, said industry officials, who asked not to be named because talks were continuing. The government has singled out ConocoPhillips as the most resistant to the takeover. Authorities have given the companies a Saturday deadline to end negotiations, rather than the original official final date of Tuesday, industry officials said DECISION-MAKING POWER Talks between Venezuela and private oil companies over the takeover of the projects are increasingly focused on how decisions will be made in the future joint ventures, according to industry officials. Two industry officials, who asked not to be named because negotiations are ongoing, said a crucial point in talks is private companies' ability to oppose controversial decisions made by state oil giant PDVSA. Discussions center on whether PDVSA, with a simple majority on the board of directors, could force private partners to accept decisions that would benefit the government at their expense. "The issue of corporate governance is enormous," said one official. "A minimum requirement would be a clear right of veto for major investment decisions." PDVSA and the private partners have "fundamentally misaligned" interests, the official said, because private companies need a profitable business, while PDVSA wants to maximize tax and royalty payments to the government. Companies ordered to convert subcontracting deals to state-majority "mixed companies" in 2005 also insisted on similar rights on their respective boards, requiring a qualified majority and in some cases unanimous votes on issues such as investments.
