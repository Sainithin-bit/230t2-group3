 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks slumped on Wednesday, as a drop in oil prices dragged down energy shares, and a possible collapse of two big hedge funds hit investment banks, overshadowing Morgan Stanley's ( MS.N ) strong profit. 

 An abrupt end to a three-day rally in the bond market drove interest rates sharply higher, prompting concerns that higher borrowing costs will hurt company profits, crimp consumer spending and slow the pace of corporate deal making that has spurred a rally in equities. "The higher interest rate environment will hurt corporate borrowing and make some of these deals a little less palatable," said Paul Nolte, director of investments at Hinsdale Associates, in Hinsdale, Illinois. It also "could have impact on the still-hurting housing market." The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was down 146.00 points, or 1.07 percent, at 13,489.42. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was down 20.86 points, or 1.36 percent, at 1,512.84. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was down 26.80 points, or 1.02 percent, at 2,599.96. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note slipped 12/32 in price for a yield of 5.14 percent, compared with 5.09 percent late on Tuesday. Bond yields and prices move inversely. Investment banks fell across the board, led by a 2.5 percent drop in Bear Stearns Cos. BSC.N to $143.20 as it struggled to keep afloat two hedge funds that suffered big losses on securities tied to the subprime mortgage market. Merrill Lynch & Co. Inc. MER.N, a main lender to the funds, was seeking bids on $800 million of assets it seized as collateral.  Merrill fell 2.62 percent to end the day at $87.68. Concerns over that situation overshadowed a stronger-than-expected earnings scorecard from Morgan Stanley. After being up for most of the session, Morgan Stanley was dragged lower by the drop in its peers, ending the day down 0.55 percent at $87.32. U.S. Treasuries fell when a three-day flight to safety bid spawned by worries over the Bear hedge funds episode gave way to concerns about rising global interest rates. That hurt interest-rate sensitive shares, including major mortgage lenders. Wells Fargo ( WFC.N ) shares fell 1.9 percent to $35.75 and Fannie Mae FNM.N stock fell 3.2 percent to $66.79. Countrywide Financial Corp. CFC.N lost 3 percent to $37.23. Exxon Mobil Corp. ( XOM.N ) and Chevron Corp. ( CVX.N ) were the biggest downside contributors to the S&P 500 after weekly government data showed a build in crude supplies to their highest level in nine years, sending crude futures CLc1 lower. Exxon stock was down 3.5 percent to $82.82 while Chevron fell 2.8 percent to $80.97. Other energy stocks trading lower included Marathon Oil ( MRO.N ), down 4.5 percent to $61.78, and Occidental Petroleum ( OXY.N ), down 3.5 percent to $57.02. Front-month July crude futures settled 91 cents lower at $68.19 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Home Depot Inc. ( HD.N ) was one of the few big gainers after the leading U.S. home improvement chain unveiled plans for a $22.5 billion share repurchase.  Home Depot shares were up 4.6 percent to $40.03 on the NYSE.
