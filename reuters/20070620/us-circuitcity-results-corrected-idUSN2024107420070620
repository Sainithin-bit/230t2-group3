 (Corrects fourth paragraph to show that sales exceeded 
expectations) 

 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Consumer electronics retailer Circuit City Stores Inc. CC.N on Wednesday posted a quarterly loss that it called disappointing and withdrew its earnings forecast, citing a drop in television sales and an uncertain economic environment. The company reported a loss of $54.6 million, or 33 cents a share, from net income of $6.4 million, or 4 cents per share, for the fiscal first quarter. Analysts, on average, had been expecting a loss of 32 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Net sales declined 4.3 percent to $2.49 billion from $2.60 billion, but exceeded analysts' expectation of $2.44 billion. The company said its profit margins fell due to a drop in domestic sales of extended warranties and on increased sales of lower-margin personal computers. Circuit City said total television comparable store sales decreased sharply, as a significant drop in projection and traditional tube televisions more than offset growth in flat-panel televisions. The results come one day after Best Buy Co. Inc. ( BBY.N ) reported quarterly earnings that missed analysts' estimates by a wide margin and gave a disappointing full-year forecast as TV sales cooled. The results and a weak earnings forecast cast new doubts on U.S. consumer spending trends, weighing on its rivals' shares and the U.S. stock market as a whole. Circuit City, which has about 46,000 employees, is in the midst of a multiyear effort to overhaul its business amid losses of market share to rival Best Buy and competition from discounters such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc.
