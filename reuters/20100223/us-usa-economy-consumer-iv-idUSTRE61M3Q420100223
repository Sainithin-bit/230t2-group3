 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence fell in February to the lowest in 10 months, as consumers' short-term outlook for the jobs market worsened. Separately, regulators said the number of problem U.S. banks rose by 27 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009. 

 KEY POINTS: * The Conference Board, an industry group, said its index of consumer attitudes fell to 46.0 in February from a revised 56.5 in the prior month. February's reading is the lowest since April, 2009. * The median of forecasts from analysts polled by Reuters was for a February reading of 55.0. The expectations index fell to 63.8 from 77.3. The present situation index dropped to 19.4 from 25.2 in January, the worst since February 1983. * Consumers' labor market assessment worsened. The "jobs hard to get" index rose to 47.7 percent from 46.5 percent, while the "jobs plentiful" index fell to 3.6 percent in February from 4.4 percent in January. KEY POINTS: * The number of "problem" U.S. banks jumped 27 percent during the fourth quarter of 2009 to 702, the highest level since 1993 and a sign the industry's recovery is still shaky, regulators reported on Tuesday. * The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp said the industry overall eked out a profit of $914 million for the quarter, benefiting from a healing economy, but said the improvement was concentrated in the largest banks. * FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair said the profit was a huge improvement over the $37.8 billion loss the industry reported in the fourth quarter of 2008. "It's not that this was a strong quarter. It's simply that everything was so bad a year ago," Bair said in a statement. COMMENTS: STEPHEN MASSOCCA, MANAGING DIRECTOR, WEDBUSH MORGAN, SAN FRANCISCO: "Obviously the consumer confidence number wasn't that good. Against that you had the Case-Shiller which probably was pretty good although that is very dated at this point - we are talking about December here at the end of February. "The one thing that is really working, the one part of the economy that seems to be humming is corporate profitability. Companies are making money. The one thing that has done very well is corporate performance. But you look elsewhere in the economy and you don't see much that is robust so it kind of puts the stock market in a quandary because, quite frankly, you are paying but when you look around the economy isn't doing so well. Case in point, today's consumer confidence number, when you see this kind of thing you have to wonder how sustainable this corporate performance is. At some point, cost cutting comes to an end." SERGEY BONDARCHUK, US INTEREST RATE STRATEGIST, BNP PARIBAS, NEW YORK: "We see a bond rally and a bit of a flattening. "If consumer confidence drops and consumers crimp their wallets a bit then this is bullish for fixed income and bearish for the economy. "If consumers think there is more trouble ahead then they will tend to save a bit more. So you see a bid in the Treasury market because of that. "Obviously the FDIC report is also helping here." DAVID RESLER, CHIEF ECONOMIST, NOMURA SECURITIES INTERNATIONAL, NEW YORK: "While the drop is disappointing, I would note that there seems to be some regularity of this index having a weak reading in February. I don't know if there is a seasonal distortion in this report or not, but it raises a question mark in my mind about whether or not we are getting a really accurate reading." STEVEN BUTLER, HEAD OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRADING, SCOTIA CAPITAL, TORONTO: "It was quite a disappointing number. A bit shocking really. Where has all the confidence gone so quickly? Equity markets are leading foreign exchange and the euro seems to be forgotten at the moment. There's more movement on dollar-yen, as this data is being seen as a reason to take risk trades off. We broke support at 90.50-60, so we might have a chance to tail down to the 90 figure in dollar-yen, but we may find a bit of support around 90.10." MATTHEW STRAUSS, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, TORONTO: "The Consumer Confidence headline is quite disappointing and I'm not surprised to see the forex markets reacting to it by shifting positions into safer assets. The headline may be overstating the softness in consumer behavior but it highlights risks to the economic recovery going forward. "The shift from government-induced growth to consumer-led growth will not be without disappointment. We can't see fed funds going up before the fourth-quarter of this year. In the short-term, safer assets, such as the yen, will get a bit of a boost." GIRI CHERUKURI, HEAD TRADER, OAKBROOK INVESTMENTS LLC,, LISLE, ILLINOIS: Regarding consumer confidence data, "that's a negative development. It looked like the economy was strengthening and consumer confidence was strengthening; hopefully this is not the start of a trend." The increased number of banks on the problem list "is not surprising. That would sort of be expected in the sense the real estate market is not completely out of the woods, and I think bank loan portfolios will get worse before they get better. It does confirm issues in the real estate market. I think we'll still see smaller banks failing." MICHAEL SHELDON, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, RDM FINANCIAL, WESTPORT, CONNECTICUT "The data was much weaker than expected, with both current market conditions as well as future expectations taking a hit last month. Based on the other data points we've seen over the past several months, the 9-point drop is surprising. "If you look at the forward-looking expectations part, business conditions, employment and income all look worse this month. Overall, there's not a lot of positive stuff to see. The response to the question about whether jobs are plentiful doesn't bode well for next month's employment report. "With equity markets having retraced about two-thirds of their recent decline, today's report could be the catalyst that leads to profit taking, though we have other data coming out this week and Bernanke's testimony, so there will be other things to focus on to see if today's report is an outlier or reflects weakening conditions in the economy." TOM PORCELLI, SENIOR ECONOMIST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, NEW YORK "This is just a flat-out bad report. We like the present situation index -- it has a better correlation with consumer spending. The present situation actually fell to its lowest point this cycle. "The labor differential deteriorated... I think if you're looking for signals for consumer spending or jobs, there are no positive signals here. "In fairness we're going through a pretty tough recovery and we know that, but I think this is a reminder that the recovery's going to be very uneven." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stock indexes added to losses. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices rose. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar added to losses.
