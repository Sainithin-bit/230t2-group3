 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Greece's private creditors on Saturday said they were close to finalizing a debt swap deal with Athens and expected to conclude talks next week. 
 The chief negotiators for the creditors, Charles Dallara and Jean Lemierre, will leave Athens on Sunday but stay in touch with Greek authorities, the Institute of International Finance, which negotiates on behalf of creditors, said in a statement.
