 (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates has told members of Congress he believes the Pentagon will need another $69.7 billion to finance the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan for the remainder of the federal fiscal year. 

 The estimate is expected to be overwritten quickly by the incoming administration of President-elect Barack Obama. It also does not include a planned major buildup of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, which could grow from 32,000 troops to more than 60,000 in coming months. But Gates, who will remain at the Pentagon's helm under Obama, told Congress in a letter dated December 31 the projection was his best current estimate of U.S. defense funding needs in the global war on terrorism through September 30, 2009. Following are the six largest funding areas contained in the Gates assessment: * $31.7 billion to fund military operations in theater; incremental pay and benefits for about 320,000 U.S. military personnel; pre-deployment training; aircraft, ship and ground vehicle transportation; subsistence and logistics support; * $10.8 billion for body armor; armored vehicles; lighter Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles; and labor costs for mechanics supporting Operation Enduring Freedom; * $7.5 billion for equipment to cover combat losses and replenish supplies and ammunition. The category includes modifications to AH-64 Apache and CH-47 Chinook helicopters built by Boeing Co; mine protection vehicles; chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear protection for soldiers; trailers, tractors and explosive ordnance disposal equipment; * $6.8 billion to finance the expansion of the U.S. Army and Marines; support clinics, treatment programs and other services for wounded troops and their families; and fund classified non-defense programs; * $3.6 billion for U.S. military intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance initiatives; * $2.3 billion to build up the Afghan National Army and staff, train and equip the Afghan National Police.
