 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. house prices posted the first quarterly drop in 13 years in the third quarter, dragging down the annual appreciation from the third quarter of 2006 to the slowest pace since 1995, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight said on Thursday. 

 Compared with the second quarter of 2007, house prices fell by 0.4 percent, the housing finance company regulator said in a statement on its Web site. That decline pressed the annual price change to 1.8 percent, the lowest four-quarter rise since 1995. "While select markets still maintain robust rates of appreciation, our newest data show price weakening in a very significant portion of the country," OFHEO director James Lockhart said in the statement. "Indeed, in the third quarter, more than 20 states experienced price declines and in some cases those declines are substantial," he said. Prices dropped in 10 states over the last four quarters, the largest number of states posting declines since the 1996-1997 period. (Reporting by  Lynn Adler , Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
