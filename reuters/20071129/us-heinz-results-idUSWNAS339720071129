 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - H.J. Heinz Co HNZ.N posted an 18 percent jump in quarterly profit on Thursday as the weak U.S. dollar improved results in Europe and emerging markets, and price increases helped offset rising ingredient costs. 

 The maker of Heinz ketchup, Ore-Ida potatoes and Smart Ones frozen meals also raised the top end of its fiscal 2008 earnings forecast as new products and a 23 percent increase in marketing lifted sales. Profit rose to $227 million, or 71 cents a share, in the company's fiscal second quarter, ended October 31, from $191.6 million, or 57 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had forecast 67 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 13 percent to $2.52 billion. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, acquisitions and divestitures, sales increased 8.1 percent . Like most U.S. food companies, Heinz has been facing higher costs for corn-based sweetener, dairy products and other ingredients. The company has raised prices and improved productivity to offset these higher expenses. Heinz said it now expects commodity costs to be up more than 7 percent this year, higher than the  5.5 percent the company forecast three months ago. With about 60 percent of Heinz's sales coming from outside the United States, sales made in euros and other strong currencies have in part offset rising commodity costs, Chief Financial Officer Art Winkleblack said during a conference call with analysts. "Our plan is to continue pricing up and aggressively drive productivity initiatives to offset the escalating commodity cost in the industry," Winkleblack said. Sales in the North American consumer products business rose 9.7 percent and profit in that business was up about 7 percent. Heinz Europe sales climbed 18 percent and profit rose 14.8 percent. Asia/Pacific sales rose 16.8 percent and profit increased 21.8 percent. But profit in the U.S. food service fell 13.5 percent, hurt by rising dairy costs and a 1.7 percent decrease in volume, a measure of products shipped that factors out price and currency fluctuations. Heinz said it now expects to earn $2.54 to $2.62 per share for the full fiscal year. It previously forecast $2.54 to $2.60. Analysts' average estimate is $2.61, according to Reuters Estimates. Heinz shares rose 26 cents to $47.45 on Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock is up about 5 percent this year, compared with a 3 percent increase for the Standard & Poor's U.S. packaged foods index .15GSPFOOD. (Reporting by Brad Dorfman; editing by Steve Orlofsky)
