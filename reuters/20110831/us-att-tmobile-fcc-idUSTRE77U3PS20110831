 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Federal Communications Commission said it will not undermine the Justice Department in its review of AT&T Inc's $39 billion bid for Deutsche Telekom AG's T-Mobile USA. 

 The Justice Department filed a lawsuit to block the deal on Wednesday because of anti-competition concerns. The FCC has never approved a significant takeover that the Justice Department has challenged in court, a commission official said. (Reporting by Jasmin Melvin. Editing by Robert MacMillan)
