 PHILADELPHIA  (Reuters) - A Credit Suisse banker has been arrested in the United States in connection with a federal investigation into the Swiss bank's work with offshore accounts, The New York Times reported on Monday. 

 The banker, Christos Bagios, was arrested in New York and transferred to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., where he was charged with conspiracy and fraud, the report said, citing unnamed sources. It was unclear whether Bagios, a Greek citizen, was cooperating with the investigation, the report said. Bagios is the head of Credit Suisse's Relationship Management West Coast group, a private banking unit that is part of Credit Suisse Private Advisors, the report said. Credit Suisse could not be immediately reached for comment. (Reporting by  Jessica Hall ; Editing by  Lincoln Feast )
