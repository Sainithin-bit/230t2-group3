 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Single-family home prices fell for the sixth month in a row in December, in line with expectations, a closely watched survey said on Tuesday. 

 The S&P/Case Shiller composite index of 20 metropolitan areas declined 0.4 percent in December from November on a seasonally adjusted basis. The figure was in line with analysts' expectations. During the fourth quarter, home prices declined 3.9 percent from the previous quarter and were down 4.1 percent compared to the fourth quarter 2009.
