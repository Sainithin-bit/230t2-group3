 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A Credit Suisse ( CSGN.VX ) banker was arrested in New York and was being moved to Florida for a court appearance, according to a law enforcement source familiar with the case. 

 The banker, Christos Bagios, is being transferred to Fort Lauderdale in Florida, where several high-profile tax evasion cases have been tried, including those involving the government's tax fraud cases against UBS AG. The New York Times reported on Monday that Bagios, a Greek citizen, has been charged with conspiracy and fraud in connection with Credit Suisse's work in offshore accounts. The law enforcement source had no details about charges against Bagios. Credit Suisse declined to comment. Bagios previously worked for UBS AG ( UBS.N ), according to that bank's website. The United States has been looking for other banks that may be aiding Americans evade taxes abroad after UBS paid $780 million and agreed to hand over nearly 5,000 account names to the U.S. government to settle tax evasion charges. A UBS representative said the bank was unaware of any new probe of the bank. "For UBS, the U.S. cross border matter has been definitively resolved," the UBS representative said. The Swiss finance ministry also declined to comment. Bagios is the head of Credit Suisse's Relationship Management West Coast group, a private banking unit that is part of Credit Suisse Private Advisors, according to the bank's website. He is listed as a 45-year-old white male on the website of the Bureau of Prisons, a unit of the U.S. Justice Department. U.S. tax authorities has been culling through data from nearly thousands of U.S. clients that came forward as part of a tax amnesty program that ended in 2009. The Internal Revenue Service earlier this month started a new amnesty program to entice tax cheats to come forward.
