 MOSCOW  (Reuters) - Russia's top energy official Igor Sechin would like Rosneft ( ROSN.MM ) to get a seat on BP's ( BP.L ) board in exchange for giving BP a slot on Rosneft's, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday. 

 The issue, which would "cement" the Arctic exploration partnership deal between Russia's largest oil company and BP, has not been decided, Russia's Deputy Prime Minister told WSJ in an interview. Sechin was also quoted as saying Surgutneftegaz ( SNGS.MM ), Russia's fourth-largest oil producer, had no plans to sell its stake in Hungarian oil and gas group MOL MOLB.BU.
