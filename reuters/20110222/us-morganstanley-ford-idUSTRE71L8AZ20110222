 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley has hired former U.S. Representative Harold Ford Jr. from Bank of America Corp to help oversee the investment bank's relationships with its clients. 

 Ford, a Democrat from Tennessee, was the youngest member of Congress when he was elected at age 26. He served in the House of Representatives for five terms, from 1996 to 2007, and was a member of the House Budget Committee and the Financial Services Committee. After leaving Congress, Ford joined Merrill Lynch as a vice chairman and senior policy adviser. Bank of America bought Merrill at the height of the financial crisis for $19 billion in January 2009. Ford will be a managing director and senior client relationship manager at Morgan Stanley, where he will report to Gregory Fleming, president of Morgan Stanley Smith Barney and president of Morgan Stanley Investment Management, and to Paul J. Taubman, co-president of institutional securities. (Reporting by  Maria Aspan ; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)
