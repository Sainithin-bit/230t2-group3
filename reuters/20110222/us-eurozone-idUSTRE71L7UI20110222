 MADRID/BERLIN  (Reuters) - Spain is confident euro zone leaders will agree to strengthen their multi-billion euro rescue fund at a summit next month, but European Central Bank member Axel Weber said enough has been done already. 

 In an interview with Reuters, Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero said Madrid was convincing markets Spain was getting its economy in order and he was confident Germany would support a stronger euro zone fund despite Chancellor Angela Merkel's domestic problems. "We are winning the battle, but I still have my guard up because we have to implement all the reforms that have generated more confidence," Zapatero told Reuters Insider television. The euro zone's 17 leaders will meet in Brussels on March 11 to discuss strengthening the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), the 440 billion euro fund set up last May and used to bail out Ireland. Germany remains reluctant to back an increase in the EFSF's effective capacity from around 250 billion euros to the full 440 billion because of domestic opposition to the move but Zapatero said he was hopeful of Merkel's support. "I am confident, confident in the capacity and commitment of Chancellor Merkel," he said. EU policymakers expect Germany to support a strengthened EFSF if the rest of the euro zone agrees measures Berlin is pressing to make their economies more competitive. Those proposals and others on broader economic governance are expected to be included in a comprehensive package that EU leaders will discuss and hope to agree at a summit on March 24/25, possibly drawing a line under the year-long debt crisis. Merkel did signal after meeting Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou that rescheduling the repayment period of Greece's EU/IMF aid could be considered within the comprehensive package. "We have a situation where the Greek aid measures are fixed at three years. In Ireland's case the period is longer at seven years. So it is up for discussion whether we can consider -- and this can only be decided together with all the other measures -- -- extending the time period of the Greek programme," she said. Papandreou used his visit to Berlin to urge longer repayment periods and lower interest rates on the 110 billion euro bailout from the European Union and International Monetary Fund granted last May in return for austerity measures to control public debt. He also urged euro zone leaders to consider allowing the euro zone rescue facility to buy back sovereign bonds in order to alleviate his country's debt burden. But this idea faces stiff opposition in Germany where any perceived relaxation of debt terms for euro zone stragglers is a sensitive subject in a year of seven German state elections. In Hamburg on Sunday, Merkel's Christian Democrats suffered their worst result since World War Two at the hands of the Social Democrats. The three coalition partners in her center-right government recommended to the German parliament on Tuesday that buybacks of government debt by the ESM be ruled out. CRISIS FUNDS "ADEQUATE" Weber, outgoing head of the Bundesbank, wrote in a column in the Financial Times that current euro crisis measures had gone far enough and no major adjustments to funds were required. "Against this backdrop, the existing instruments for short-term crisis resolution are adequate and, despite repeated demands to the contrary, should not undergo significant adjustment," he wrote. Yields on Spanish and other peripheral euro zone bonds rose on Tuesday, but it reflected risk aversion due to North African concerns and demand was decent, traders said. While Spain's overhaul of the economy seems to have convinced markets the worst may be over -- the spread of Spanish 10-year government bonds over German bunds has fallen around 30 basis points in the past month -- Portugal remains a concern. A euro zone source told Reuters last week that there was now a consensus among EU member states that Portugal would have to seek a bailout by April, and that view remains common among officials in Brussels. However, Portuguese Finance Minister Fernando Teixeira dos Santos told Japan's Nikkei newspaper during a visit to Tokyo he believed the country would continue to be able to fund itself in the markets without seeking euro zone aid. Portugal has around 4.3 billion euros of bonds falling due in April and another 4.9 billion in June. A portion of that debt may be sold in private placements in Asia, with both China and Japan having indicated that they could buy euro zone bonds. Since Portugal's immediate funding needs do not fall until April, it can afford to wait until EU leaders meet to see if a deal then calms financial markets and provides a reprieve. If the package does not include a strengthening of the EFSF, that could pile further pressure on Lisbon.
