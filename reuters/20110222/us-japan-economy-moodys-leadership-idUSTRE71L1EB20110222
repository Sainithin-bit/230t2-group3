 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Moody's Investors Service said on Tuesday that effective fiscal reform in Japan would require stability at the top levels of government. 

 Tom Byrne, senior vice president and regional credit officer at Moody's Investors Service, told a news conference he did not see any immediate change in the behavior of investors in Japanese government bonds, although a fall in household savings could create a risk premium on JGBs in the longer term. Earlier on Tuesday Moody's changed its outlook on Japan's Aa2 rating to negative from stable and warned it could lower the sovereign rating if government policies fall short of the comprehensive tax reform needed to keep public debt under control. Prime Minister Naoto Kan has staked his career on overhauling the social security system and raising the sales tax to bolster Japan's finances, but he faces a divided parliament where opposition parties are threatening to block budget-related bills and force the unpopular premier to resign or call a snap election.
