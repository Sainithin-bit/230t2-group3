 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The National Association of Realtors said on Monday any overcounting of existing home sales in its data was "relatively minor". 

 The Realtors group said it was consulting with a range of experts to determine whether there was a drift in its monthly existing home sales data. "At this point, we believe any drift in our data to be relatively minor," the NAR said. The NAR issued the comment following a Wall Street Journal report that the NAR data underestimated the collapse of the housing industry.
