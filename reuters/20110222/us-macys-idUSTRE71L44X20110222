 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Macy's Inc ( M.N ) expects its sales gains to continue this year, helped by a broader array of exclusive and private brands, and said it should be able to manage the higher cost of cotton used in the clothes it sells. 

 The department store operator reported a higher-than-expected profit, helped by strong sales gains during the holiday quarter. For the new fiscal year just under way, Macy's expects sales at stores open at least a year to rise 3 percent. It forecast earnings of between $2.25 and $2.30 a share, which would be an increase from the just-ended year. Macy's, whose shoppers are considered by analysts to be less price-conscious than those of rivals J.C. Penney Co Inc ( JCP.N ) and Kohl's Corp ( KSS.N ), said its purchasing power with vendors and its product assortment would help mitigate the impact of higher cotton and cashmere costs on profits. "We are less reliant on opening price point basics and have the ability to add quality features and fashion details that command a higher price," Chief Financial Officer Karen Hoguet told investors on a call. She said that about 43 percent of sales now come from its more profitable private and exclusive products, such as Kenneth Cole Reaction and Madonna's Material Girl line. Kohl's, which reports results on Thursday, is nearing the 50 percent mark on exclusive lines. Penney reports on Friday. Among major retailers, Macy's has reported some of the largest sales gains in the past year as shoppers more confident about their finances and jobs have traded back up to mid-tier department stores. Chief Executive Officer Terry Lundgren in a statement credited the company's efforts to decentralize sourcing, allowing regional managers to choose merchandise according to local tastes. He said those efforts still were at an early stage and would continue to lift results. Despite the positive numbers, Wall Street's reaction was muted and shares fell 2.6 percent, while the broader S&P 500 Index was down 1.8 percent. "The question is, is there any juice left (in those initiatives)?" said Morningstar analyst Paul Swinand, adding there might be concerns that the company's "localization" efforts might increase costs as it needs to hire more people. Macy's operates about 800 namesake department stores and 45 Bloomingdale's stores, as well as four Bloomingdale's outlets. Hoguet said the company plans to open another three Bloomingdale's outlets, but no new department stores. The company reported net income of $667 million, or $1.55 a share, for the fourth quarter ended on January 29, up nearly 50 percent from $445 million, or $1.05 a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, earnings were $1.57 per share, compared with analysts' expectations of $1.52, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Same-store sales rose 4.3 percent, as Macy's previously reported. Overall sales rose 5.4 percent to $8.27 billion. Shares of Macy's were down 62 cents at $23.13 in afternoon trading.
