 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Prices of U.S. single-family homes plunged a record 15.4 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, surpassing the steep drop in the first quarter, according to the Standard & Poor's/Case Shiller national home price index reported on Tuesday.

S&P said its composite index of 10 metropolitan areas slipped 0.6 percent in June versus May, for a 17.0 percent year-over-year drop. (Reporting by  Richard Leong , Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
