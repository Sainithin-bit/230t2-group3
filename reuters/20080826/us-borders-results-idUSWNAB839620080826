 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Borders Group Inc BGP.N on Tuesday posted a narrower quarterly loss, as the second-largest U.S. bookseller was helped by lower inventory levels. 

 The company, which put itself up for sale in March, had a second-quarter loss from continuing operations of $11.3 million, or 19 cents per share, compared with its year-ago loss of $18.1 million, or 31 cents per share. Total sales from continuing operations fell 7 percent to $749.2 million. (Reporting by  Lisa Baertlein )
