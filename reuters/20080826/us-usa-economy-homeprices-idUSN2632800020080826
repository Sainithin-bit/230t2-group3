 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Prices of U.S. single-family homes plunged a record 15.4 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, surpassing the steep drop in the first quarter, according to the Standard & Poor's/Case Shiller national home price index reported on Tuesday.
    

  KEY POINTS:  * The S&P/Case Shiller composite index of 20 metropolitan areas slipped 0.5 percent in June from May, bringing the measure down 15.9 percent from June 2007.  * S&P said its composite index of 10 metropolitan areas slipped 0.6 percent in June versus May, for a 17.0 percent year-over-year drop.  COMMENTS: GARY SHILLING, PRESIDENT, A. GARY SHILLING & CO, SPRINGFIELD, NEW JERSEY: "It's more of the same. We are looking for the Case-Shiller measure to eventually show a 40 percent total decline, peak to trough. The key point is we are a long way from bottoming out. The bulls keep hoping otherwise, but the basic problem is excess inventories. They are the mortal enemy of prices. That's true of any goods-producing sector and certainty is true of housing. We estimate that 2 million houses were built during the boom, and we've only worked that excess down to 1.8 million as of the beginning of 2008. We think we will see prices falling until the fourth quarter of 2010. There will be a lot more write-downs at financial institutions and a lot more problems for consumers. They have run out of borrowing power, principally because they can no longer rely on home equity."  MARKET REACTION:  STOCKS: U.S. equity index futures dipped  BONDS: U.S. Treasury prices hold steady at lower levels  DOLLAR: U.S. dollar holds steady at higher levels  RATE FUTURES: Fed fund futures are little moved, suggesting little chance of an FOMC rate hike this year
