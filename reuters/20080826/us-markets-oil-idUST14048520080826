 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oil rose on Tuesday as Hurricane Gustav churned through the Caribbean and took aim at U.S. oil and natural gas installations in the Gulf of Mexico. 

 Most weather models showed Gustav entering the Gulf -- home to a quarter of U.S. oil production and 15 percent of natural gas output -- by early Sunday. "All of the oil platforms off Texas and Louisiana will probably be at risk, but that's real long-range," Eric Wilhelm, a senior meteorologist at AccuWeather Inc, told Reuters, adding that Gustav could hit the Gulf of Mexico as a Category 3 hurricane. U.S. crude settled up $1.16 at $116.27 a barrel, while London Brent crude traded up 60 cents to settle at $114.63 a barrel. Gustav, a Category 1 hurricane, hit southern Haiti on Tuesday, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc ( RDSa.L ), one of the top producers in the region, said it would begin evacuating nonessential workers from offshore rigs on Wednesday.  Other companies were also monitoring the storm, which pushed up U.S. natural gas futures. Hurricanes Katrina and Rita devastated oil and natural gas production and refining facilities in the region in 2005, sending prices to then-record highs. The storm helped stem oil's slide from a record above $147 a barrel hit in July, as mounting economic problems in consumer nations threaten demand. U.S. oil demand for June was 5.6 percent below a year ago, the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported on Tuesday, as high fuel prices and the wider economic crisis battered motorists in the world's top consumer. Germany's gross domestic product contracted by 0.5 percentage points in the April-June period, the first contraction since 2004 and raising concerns Europe's biggest economy could be headed for a recession. Further support for prices on Tuesday came from escalating tensions between the West and Russia over Georgia. Russia recognized two rebel regions of Georgia -- South Ossetia and Abkhazia -- as independent states on Tuesday, escalating tension in the volatile Caucasus and putting Moscow on a collision course with the West. While the conflict has disrupted Azeri oil shipments through Georgia, analysts said this latest development was having little influence on oil prices so far. Analysts polled by Reuters forecast weekly U.S. inventory data due to be released on Wednesday will show a 1 million barrel build in crude stocks, a 500,000 barrel build in distillate stocks, and a 2.9 million barrel draw in gasoline inventories.
