 TAIPEI  (Reuters) - Merrill Lynch executives arrived in Taipei to clarify the company's role involving in the possible money laundering by family members of ex-president Chen Shui-bian, a local newspaper said on Tuesday. 

 Family members of Chen, who was in office from 2000 to May 2008, were suspected of graft, prompting prosecutors to investigate them over the past few years, tarnishing the image of the Democratic Progressive Party. Merrill Lynch sent two Asia-based executives to Taipei on Monday to clarify the company's role in the case, the Chinese-language China Times paper said. Vicki Kwong, a Merrill Lynch spokesperson, declined to comment on any aspects of the case or whether any company executives had arrived in Taiwan. Taiwan's Justice Ministry said earlier this month its Swiss counterparts have requested assistance in an investigation into the money laundering involving accounts held by Chen's son Chen Chih-chung and daughter-in-law Huang Jui-ching.
