 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve policy makers on August 5 saw a weakening economic outlook, exacerbated by stress in financial markets, as outweighing persistent concerns about inflation expectations becoming unmoored, minutes of their meeting showed. 

  KEY POINTS:  * At the meeting, which resulted in an unchanged 2 percent federal funds rate, members of the Federal Open Market Committee agreed that softening labor markets, high energy prices and a continuing housing contraction would weigh on growth in coming quarters.  * "In addition, members saw continuing downside risks to this outlook, particularly reflecting possible further deterioration in financial conditions," the Fed said.  COMMENTS:  DANIEL NORTH, CHIEF ECONOMIST, EULER HERMES, OWINGS MILL, MARYLAND: "I think the statement is pretty dovish on inflation. There is a lot more text discussing the weakness on the economy like consumer spending. There seems more emphasis on the downside risk to growth." "When it talks about inflation, it's focus more on core inflation rather than headline inflation. They have a good story with slowing growth reining in prices, especially in the labor market. Unit labor costs have been very modest. Commodity prices have also come down sharply."  CARL KAUFMAN, FIXED-INCOME PORTFOLIO MANAGER, OSTERWEIS CAPITAL  MANAGEMENT, SAN FRANCISCO: "Inflation is probably not that big of a problem this go-around because you're don't have the wage-price spiral. You're not seeing growth in wages. That's the bottom line. "Until you see growth in wages, there's very little risk of a wage-price spiral. That in effect is a dampening affect. So the Fed is worried, but I don't think they need to get crazy here, And also because you're not creating another bubble, because even though you have low interest rates, you might have a carry trade here or there, there's no money to borrow."  MARY ANN HURLEY, VICE PRESIDENT OF FIXED-INCOME TRADING, D.A.  DAVIDSON & CO., SEATTLE: "Do they not see the problems that the economy is facing? I just don't know if the Fed gets it or not. They certainly seem to be focused on inflation, which is fine. Most policymakers see the next move as being an increase. But, when you have unemployment going up, jobless claims ratcheting higher, nonfarm payrolls falling, retail sales only supported by the tax cuts, the housing recession still in full bloom, I just don't know how they can even utter the word 'increase'."  STEPHEN STANLEY, CHIEF ECONOMIST, RBS GREENWICH CAPITAL  MARKETS, GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT: "The main thing is that it does not look like policy is going to be changing any time soon, but we continue to get hawkish rhetoric out of the minutes. There was a point in time early in the year and even late last year where it felt like the rhetoric in the minutes was, if anything, more dovish than what you were getting from the FOMC statements and from some of the running commentary, and now it is the opposite. It generally feels as if, with the markets struggling a little bit more, people in the markets have kind of gotten the impression that the Fed has backed off from their hawkish language, but you definitely do not get that sense from reading the minutes."  ANNA PIRETTI, SENIOR ECONOMIST, BNP PARIBAS, NEW YORK: "It's in line as expected. They appear more hawkish than dovish. A rate-cut is not an option. They are happy to leave rates on hold until financial market conditions settle. "We have some dissent. Not everyone is on the same page. Those on the board who are in touch in the market every day have focused on credit conditions, which remain very tight. On the other hand, some of the regional officials are more vocal about inflation risks and core inflation won't go down if they don't raise rates." "On balance, the FOMC is still very mindful of the problems in the financial markets. Conditions in the labor market are also very weak. These worries overweigh those on inflation."  KURT KARL, CHIEF US ECONOMIST, SWISS RE, NEW YORK: "The Fed is on hold and the minutes verify that. That's ultimately good news for equities and bad for bonds. We may not see it today, but that's been the message they've been sending in the past month or so. The Fed has been consistent in saying that the economy is slowing and that inflation is expected to moderate."  JOE MANIMBO, CURRENCY TRADER, RUESCH INTERNATIONAL, WASHINGTON: "I don't see any real surprises. The Fed continued to voice concern on the outlook for inflation and so that suggests that the Fed could eventually lift U.S. interest rates in coming months which would be dollar supportive. But equal concerns on downside risks to growth and upside risks to inflation are keeping dollar activity restrained in the aftermath of the minutes."  MARKET REACTION:  STOCKS: U.S. equity indexes shed gains, turn negative  BONDS: U.S. Treasury prices hold small losses  DOLLAR: U.S. dollar holds steady at higher levels  RATE FUTURES: Fed fund futures slightly boost prospects for 2009 rate hike  EARLIER DATA FROM AUG 26 June U.S. home prices plunge from year earlier
