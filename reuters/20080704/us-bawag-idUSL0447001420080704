 VIENNA  (Reuters) - A Vienna court on Friday sentenced nine men to prison sentences for their roles in causing losses at Austrian bank BAWAG P.S.K. of as much as 1.7 billion euros ($2.7 billion) through risky investments. 

 Following are five facts about the court ruling. - The court convicted former BAWAG Chief Executive Helmut Elsner of breach of trust, fraud and false accounting and sentenced him to nine and a half years in prison. - Fund manager Wolfgang Floettl, who had made the investments, was sentenced to two and a half years in prison, with 20 months of the sentence suspended. The other defendants were sentenced to between two and five years in prison. Some of the sentences were partly suspended. - Judge Claudia Bandion-Ortner, an assessory judge and two lay judges heard 104 witnesses in 116 court sessions and pored over around 250 ring folders of documents since the trial started on July 16, 2007. Witnesses included ECB executive board member Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell, former Austrian Finance Minister Karl-Heinz Grasser, and Floettl's wife Anne Eisenhower, a granddaughter of the former U.S. President. - BAWAG's losses became public more than five years after they were incurred and only after U.S. authorities investigated BAWAG's role in the collapse of U.S. futures trader Refco Inc. BAWAG settled with Refco creditors in 2006 and agreed to pay $683 million in damages. - BAWAG was founded in 1922 as "Workers' Bank" to manage the Austrian trade union federation's funds. The trade union sold the bank to buyout fund Cerberus Capital for 3.2 billion euros after the offshore losses became public. (Reporting by  Boris Groendahl ; editing by Sue Thomas)
