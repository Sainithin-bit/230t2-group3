 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department wants to find a "responsible" way to provide government aid to troubled lender CIT Group Inc, Representative Barney Frank said on Wednesday. 

 "I've spoken with (Treasury) Secretary Geithner, and I understand they're working hard to try to come up with something responsible to try to prevent the failure," Frank told Reuters in an interview. Frank said if CIT is allowed to fail, "I think there would be a great deal of harm to the overall economy." (Reporting by  Karey Wutkowski ; Editing by  Derek Caney )
