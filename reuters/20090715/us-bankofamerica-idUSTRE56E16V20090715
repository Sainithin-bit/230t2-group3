 (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) is mounting a campaign to rehire several of the more than three dozen senior Merrill Lynch & Co investment bankers who quit after the firms merged, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the efforts. 

 Those approached in recent weeks include Samuel Chapin, a Merrill vice chairman who left in April and who was part of a group of senior bankers who focused on maintaining relationships with large corporate clients, the news agency said. Bank of America could not be immediately reached for comment by Reuters. (Reporting by Hezron Selvi in Bangalore; editing by John Stonestreet)
