 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - A petition floated by top U.S. economists is urging Congress to reaffirm support for the independence of the Federal Reserve system, saying that the trajectory of the economy and inflation is at risk. 

 The petition, framed as an "Open Letter to Congress and the Executive Branch," was conceived by eight economists including former Fed Governor Frederic Mishkin. It has over 180 signatories from U.S. academic institutions and businesses. To view petition click on:  here "The independence of U.S. monetary policy is at risk. We urge Congress and the Executive Branch to reaffirm their support for and defend the independence of the (Fed) as a foundation of U.S. economic stability," the statement said. "Central bank independence has been shown to be essential for controlling inflation," the statement added. Moreover, if the Fed -- the U.S. central bank -- is given new responsibilities for overseeing risk within the U.S. financial system, "every effort must be made to avoid compromising its ability to manage monetary policy as it sees fit." The petition comes at a time when the Fed's independence is under attack by Congress, and President Barack Obama is mulling whether to reappoint Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, whose term expires in January. A proposal from a long-time congressional foe of the Fed to give lawmakers more sway over the Fed's decisions has won considerable bipartisan support. "Calls to alter the structure or personnel selection of the Federal Reserve System easily could backfire by raising inflation expectations and borrowing costs and dimming prospects for recovery," the petition said.
