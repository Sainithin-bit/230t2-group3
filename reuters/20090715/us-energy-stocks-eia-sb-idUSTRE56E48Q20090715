 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. crude stocks fell more than expected last week as demand from refiners rose, while distillates edged up to a new 25-year high, the Energy Information Administration said in weekly data Wednesday. 

 Gasoline stocks increased more than forecast in the week, which included the Fourth of July Independence Day holiday weekend, when summer travel traditionally peaks, boosting demand for motor fuel. EIA said commercial crude oil stocks in the United States fell by 2.8 million barrels in the week to 344.5 million barrels, while analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a drop of 1.6 million barrels. Crude runs, or demand by domestic refiners, were up by 139,000 barrels per day, the report added. Supplies of distillates, including diesel and heating oil, were up by 600,000 barrels in the week to July 10, hitting a total of 159.3 million barrels, the EIA reported. The latest rise missed analysts projections of a 1.9 million barrel build but put the supplies at just below the 159.5 million reached the week of December 28, 1994. Gasoline stocks increased to 214.6 million barrels, up 1.5 million, against analysts' expectations of a 1-million-barrel rise. Refinery utilization rose by 1.1 percentage points to 87.9 percent against a forecast by analysts for a decline of 0.1 percentage point. On Tuesday afternoon, the American Petroleum Institute reported that U.S. crude oil stocks fell 1.2 million barrels last week, while gasoline inventories dipped 69,000 barrels and distillates unexpectedly rose 656,000 barrels.
