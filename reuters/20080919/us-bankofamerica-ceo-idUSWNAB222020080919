 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis on Friday called on federal regulators to tighten oversight of investment banks, just four days after he agreed to pay $50 billion for the third-largest, Merrill Lynch & Co MER.N. 

 In a speech to the National Black MBA Association in Washington, D.C., Lewis said the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision in March to open its discount window to investment banks should subject them to "more of the oversight, capital requirements and business restrictions" that commercial banks face. "The logic seems pretty clear," he said. "If you're going to have a public backstop, you need to subject yourself to public oversight." The discount window is the Fed's traditional way of providing liquidity. On Friday, the central bank said it will also open the window to financial institutions seeking to buy troubled assets in money market mutual funds, to help those funds avoid losing investor principal.
