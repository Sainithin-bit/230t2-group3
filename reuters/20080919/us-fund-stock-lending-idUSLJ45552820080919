 LONDON  (Reuters) - A global crackdown on the short-selling of financial stocks gathered pace on Friday, kick-started by a move from the UK's Financial Services Authority. 

 Regulators in the United States and Ireland are among those following suit, while several large European and U.S. pension funds have banned stock lending in the financial sector. Markets have staged a widespread recovery this morning on hopes the move will help restore investor confidence. Here are some comments from the fund management industry: MARTIN GILBERT, CHIEF EXECUTIVE, ABERDEEN ASSET MANAGEMENT: "The ban is a good idea and it will help. Well, it has already helped. But I think they had to do it. It just becomes self-perpetuating. I think the financial stability of the banking sector is the more important than anything else." KEITH SKEOCH, CHIEF EXECUTIVE, STANDARD LIFE INVESTMENTS: "I think it's absolutely the right thing to do, these are extraordinary times, extraordinary markets and they require exceptional measures and I am particularly pleased it has been put in place because it shows action by part of the UK authorities and I think the FSA should be applauded. "That said I'm also particularly pleased that it's temporary and I think that the market should be allowed to settle down and short selling is part of the market and quite pleased that at some point the ban will be lifted." ROBERT JENKINS, CHAIRMAN, INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION: "At such times confidence is key. We believe this may be helpful." PAUL LEE, DIRECTOR AT HERMES EOS, WHICH HAS IMPOSED ITS OWN  LENDING BAN: "This week when it looked to us like what was going had shifted from a healthy cleanout of the excesses of the market to an unhealthy chasing down of the weakest members of the pack, we decided to put a whole slate of UK and international stocks on our stop lending stock list."
