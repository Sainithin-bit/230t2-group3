 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said on Thursday he and congressional leaders are working on a plan to "address systemic risks" in U.S. capital markets and deal with problem assets. 

 "We talked about a comprehensive approach that will require legislation to deal with illiquid assets on financial institutions' balance sheets," Paulson told reporters. Senate Majority leader Harry Reid, a Democrat from Nevada, said he expected to see a proposal "in a matter of hours, not days." "We look forward to working closely with Congress to resolve this financial crisis and get our economy moving again," Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said.
