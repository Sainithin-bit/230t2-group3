 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Bush administration is planning to send the U.S. Congress a proposal to create an institution to deal with illiquid assets plaguing world capital markets, the chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee said on Thursday. 

 After a meeting with senior administration officials, Rep. Barney Frank said, "It will be the power -- it may not be an entity -- it will be the power to buy up the illiquid assets." The Massachusetts Democrat told reporters there is concern that setting up a formal entity "could take too long." He also there was "virtually unanimous agreement" that there would be legislation to create such a power. Frank was among top lawmakers who met with Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Christopher Cox at an extraordinary evening session in the offices of House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi in the U.S. Capitol. Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby, who also attended, said the meeting focused on "how to deal with a lot of illiquid assets ... We're waiting to see the proposal that Treasury and the Fed will be sending up to us." Shelby is the senior Republican on the Senate Banking Committee.
