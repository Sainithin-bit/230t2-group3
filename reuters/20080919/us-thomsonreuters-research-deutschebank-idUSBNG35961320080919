 (Reuters) - Thomson Reuters Plc's TRIL.L Markets division revenue will likely take a hit from the current turmoil in the financial markets, at least two analysts said Friday. 

 "Given that more financial institutions may still be at risk it seems likely... that Markets revenues will turn negative next year," Collins Stewart analyst Gareth Thomas wrote in a note to clients. Separately, Deutsche Bank's Mark Braley noted that fifty percent of Thomson Reuters Markets' revenue are headcount driven and said this will now decline faster than previously expected. He downgraded the stock to "sell" from "buy," and cut his price target to 1,000 pence from 2,400 pence. "The direct hit to TR Market's headcount-driven business will be severe," Braley said. Thomson Reuters' Markets division includes the Reuters and Thomson news operations as well as financial data and tools for investment banks and other financial firms. On Thursday, the news and information publisher's Chief Executive Tom Glocer said business had a "good shot" of having positive revenue growth next year despite the market turmoil. However, Deutsche's Braley said bank failures and mergers will cut demand for the company's systems and software, while a sustained period of market paralysis will see a drop in usage volumes. Pricing power will also be inevitably weaker, he added. Braley now expects the investment banking industry to lose 25 percent of jobs in 2008-10, up from his prior forecast of 15 percent. Job losses will be as severe as that seen in the 1969-75 downturn, and far worse than 1987-91 or 2001-03, he added. In August, Thomson Reuters reported slower revenue growth as the U.S. credit crisis forced investment banks to cut budgets and lay off thousands of workers. Shares of Thomson Reuters were trading up 8.2 percent at 1,374 pence by 5:35 a.m. EDT on the London Stock Exchange.
