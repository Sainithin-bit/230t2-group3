 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. securities regulators are considering a temporary ban on short selling of some or all stocks, a source briefed on the matter said on Thursday. 

 The short sale ban is one of a number of options being considered by the President's Working Group on Financial Markets, which includes the heads of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Reserve Board and the U.S. Treasury Secretary. Any SEC action would require the approval of its commissioners. (Reporting by  Rachelle Younglai ; Editing by  Tim Dobbyn )
