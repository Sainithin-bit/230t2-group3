 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd on Thursday said Congress will respond to a Treasury Department proposal for containing the Wall Street crisis after they receive details, which could occur sometime this weekend. 

 Speaking to reporters after congressional leaders met with Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, Dodd said he expected Treasury details "sometime over the weekend" and that "based on a bicameral bipartisan basis we will react to it." But Dodd added that it also could take the Fed and Treasury slightly longer to provide Congress with details and noted his committee is holding a hearing on Tuesday, with the new proposal likely being the main topic. Dodd added: "I have no idea what it will look like at this point. I can't tell you numbers, volume. This is a very serious moment." Asked whether he approved of the direction Paulson and Bernanke appeared to be headed with their plan, Dodd offered no specifics. But he said: "You've got to deal with the housing foreclosure issue. I've said that for two straight years on an hourly basis. I think there's finally some recognition of that." Dodd repeatedly stressed that what currently is being developed is a Treasury and Fed proposal, not one from Congress. Lawmakers will look at the plan and then "add anything, subtract anything," Dodd said. Describing Thursday's meeting in the Capitol as "a very sober gathering," Dodd said: "I've been in the Senate 28 years and Congress 34. There's never been a moment as serious as this one."
