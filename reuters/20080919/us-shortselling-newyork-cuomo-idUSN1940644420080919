 ALBANY  (Reuters) - New York state Attorney General Andrew Cuomo on Friday said he should know have some results from his short-selling probe in "a matter of weeks," adding the complaints he is investigating have specific allegations. 

 "We are doing this relatively quickly so we will know in a matter of weeks," the Democrat said when asked on an Albany radio show how long it would take for him to determine if there was something there.
