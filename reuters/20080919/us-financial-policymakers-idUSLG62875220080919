 TOKYO/SEOUL  (Reuters) - Asia-Pacific nations kept up efforts on Friday to shield the region from the fallout of Wall Street upheaval even as stock and currencies rallied in response to emergency action from the world's top financial authorities. 

 Japan, Australia, India and Indonesia pumped over $42 billion into their money markets as cash remained hard to come by despite Thursday's unprecedented move by the U.S. Federal Reserve to make $180 billion available by to the global banking system. The Chinese government bought shares in three of the biggest state-owned banks and ditched a tax on purchases of stocks to support its stock market. Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa told lawmakers that the central bank kept all of its options open, when asked about the possibility of cutting its ultra-low 0.5 percent benchmark rate. His South Korean counterpart promised to act aggressively and supply enough cash to the financial system to calm markets while New Zealand relaxed rules on collateral to ease funding conditions.  Asian stocks and currencies rallied on Friday taking cue from Wall Street gains overnight following news of a U.S. Treasury plan to create a fund that would mop up toxic debt, similar to one that helped resolve the savings and loan crisis of the late 1980s. Britain imposed a temporary ban on short selling of financial stocks on Thursday. The Wall Street Journal reported U.S. regulators were considering a similar step and the Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Christopher Cox told reporters he could make a statement on the issue as early as Friday. Short selling allows investors to profit from falling prices and has helped bring Wall Street icons to their knees. The plans offered investors a glimmer of hope for resolution to the 13-month old credit crisis that sank Lehman Brothers, stripped Merrill Lynch and Bear Stearns of their independence and triggered a $85 billion bailout of insurer  AIG. TIGHT CASH The news helped bring down overnight dollar interbank rates in London to 2 percent, around the Fed's target. But during the Asian day funding remained tight with banks lending dollars to each other at between 3 and 6 percent, still off a peak of 10 percent hit on Tuesday. "They are dealing well with an extremely difficult situation ... they may need to do more to boost liquidity and confidence," said David Mann, currency strategist at Standard Chartered Bank in Hong Kong. Mindful of sharp market swings in the past week and anxiety still gripping investors, officials sought to play it safe, expecting tight funding conditions would persist for some time. Asked in parliament whether an interest rate cut by the Bank of Japan was a possibility, the central bank chief said: "We have no pre-determined conclusion. You just talked about an urgent rate cut. Central banks, including the BOJ, always consider all options. That's our principle." While the world's top central banks dished out billions of dollars to grease money markets, both the Bank of Japan and the Fed kept their benchmark rates on hold this week and the European Central Bank is expected to keep its rates steady too. South Korean authorities said they would meet next week to work out ways of protecting Asia's fourth-largest economy from the impact of global markets turbulence. "There are worries that the instability in the financial markets could hurt the real economy," Finance Minister Kang Man-soo told a meeting of senior financial officials. "The government needs to look more closely into the situation and study possible ways to minimize any impact," he said. The Bank of Japan pumped 3 trillion yen ($28.72 billion) into the money market for the fourth day in a row as foreign borrowers struggled to get cash and were charged much more than the central bank's 0.5 percent policy target for overnight funds. India injected 591 billion Indian rupees ($12.75 billion) into its money market at a repo auction, in part to offset the effect of interventions in support of its currency. In Australia, the central bank added A$2.03 billion ($1.6 billion) in its regular market operation repurchase agreements, while draining A$1.0 billion through a same-day forex swap. Indonesia's central bank also stepped to help in with help with little less than $500 million in six-day funds.
