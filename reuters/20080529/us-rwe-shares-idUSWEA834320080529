 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Private equity fund Permira PERM.UL is not interested in German utility RWE AG ( RWEG.DE ), a financial source close to the matter said on Thursday, denying market rumors. 

 Traders earlier said market talk that Permira, Blackstone ( BX.N ) and Warren Buffett were jointly bidding for RWE was boosting RWE shares, which were up 2.4 percent at 83.52 euros at 18:01 a.m. EDT (1201 GMT). Permira declined to comment, as did RWE. Five-year credit default swaps on RWE were little changed at 49.5 basis points, a trader in London said. "I would be very surprised if it's true," he said. "The company's got a market cap of over 40 billion (euros) ($62.4 billion). It would be a big step for even people like Blackstone or Buffett to take it private."
