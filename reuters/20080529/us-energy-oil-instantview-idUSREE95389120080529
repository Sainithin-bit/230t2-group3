 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil and gasoline stockpiles fell sharply last week, according to a weekly report from the Energy Information Administration released on Thursday. 

 Distillate stocks showed a larger-than-expected build. Oil prices initially rose $2 after the report was released before giving up gains.

HIGHLIGHTS FROM EIA REPORT (In million barrels): - Crude -8.8 (forecast unchanged) - Distillate +1.6 (forecast +0.8) - Gasoline -3.2 (forecast -0.2) ANALYST COMMENTS: TIM EVANS, ENERGY ANALYST, CITI FUTURES PERSPECTIVE, NEW  YORK: "Crude stocks fell sharply. But the U.S. inventory situation is not necessarily an indication of the global market. Imports were certainly low last week on the crude oil and gasoline supply. That doesn't mean world supplies are low. If U.S. refiners aren't importing, it just means supplies are building up elsewhere. Refiners may be afraid to load up on crude oil at $130 a barrel. And they still have enough enough to run with." KYLE COOPER, IAF ADVISORS, ENERGY FUTURES RESEARCH,  HOUSTON "I don't think there is a physical shortage (of crude oil)... I just don't think it's coming here, I think it's going to other places. But nonetheless, it was a bullish headline, we did not expect that obviously. "As the crude imports fell, inventories fell. I think (the drop in inventories) is solely associated with those imports." JIM RITTERBUSCH, PRESIDENT, RITTERBUSCH & ASSOCIATES,  GALENA, ILLINOIS "The numbers looked bullish as the unexpectedly large crude stock draw of 8.8 million barrels combined with a surprisingly big drop in gasoline stocks of 3.2 million barrels will revive a decidedly bullish tone to the complex. "The distillate stock increase of 1.6 million barrels was larger than we expected and, while the heating oil futures will relinquish further bullish leadership in the complex, look for the heat futures to be pulled up by crude and gasoline. "Cushing crude stocks built more than expected by 700,000 barrels, a development that could place some pressure on the crude curve. Meanwhile, the unchanged level of runs could help to keep the crack spreads well supported despite the huge crude supply draw." MARK WAGGONER, PRESIDENT, EXCEL FUTURES, HUNTINGTON BEACH,  CALIFORNIA: "The biggest thing in the EIA data is the large crude draw, which was unexpected. Prices are vacillating right now, but the target is towards $135." ERIC WITTENAUER, ANALYST AT WACHOVIA SECURITIES IN ST.  LOUIS "Crude imports were not down enough to account for an 8.8 million barrel draw on crude so I'm not exactly sure how you get to that big of a draw. Crude futures have shown some reluctance to hold on to the gains that came immediately after the numbers came out. That may prove to be bearish as demand continues to slacken, particularly in the U.S. and the industrialized nations. Refinery use continues to be relatively weak which is indicative of poor demand, especially for gasoline." ROB KURZATKOWSKI, FUTURES ANALYST WITH OPTIONSXPRESS IN  CHICAGO "Today's report is nothing but bullish once again, especially after last week's report. Whenever the market seems to be pulling off, the inventory reports spark a rally. The dollar is holding up but it is not holding crude back. Next week's report is going to be a much bigger report for demand because it is going to include the Memorial Day holiday. One thing that could drag on the report is the 700,000 build at Cushing, so at least the NYMEX delivery point is amply supplied."
