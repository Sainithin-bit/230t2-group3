 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - H.J. Heinz Co HNZ.N on Thursday raised its forecast for annual earnings growth, with foods its touts as healthier and emerging markets helping fuel the increase. 

 The company also posted a 7 percent increase in fiscal fourth-quarter profit, in line with analysts' estimates, helped by price increases and the weak U.S. dollar. The maker of Heinz ketchup, Ore-Ida frozen potatoes and a host of other packaged foods said it expects earnings per share to grow 8 percent to 11 percent annually over the next two years, up from a previous target of 7 percent to 9 percent. For those same years, it forecast an annual increase of 6 percent or more in organic sales -- which factor out currency fluctuations and acquisitions and divestitures -- lifted by increased marketing spending and new product development. Heinz shares rose 2.7 percent on the forecast. "I think it was a great shot of adrenaline that they took their long-term outlook up the way they did," said Matthew Kaufler, portfolio manager of the Touchstone Value Opportunities Fund, which owns Heinz shares. Kaufler said Heinz's strong portfolio of brands is helping the company cope with soaring commodity cost. Heinz said it plans to launch 400 new products over the next two years and spend an additional $60 million to $100 million to market them. The company, less than two years removed from a proxy fight in which activist investor Nelson Peltz and a colleague won seats on the Heinz board, said profit was $194.1 million, or 61 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, ended April 30, up from $181.0 million, or 55 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 11 percent to $2.69 billion, with 4.5 percentage points of the rise coming from higher pricing and 1.2 percentage points from higher volume. The company's sales are also helped by the weak dollar, which boosts the dollar value of overseas sales. Like many food companies, Heinz has been hit by soaring commodity costs and has been investing in increased marketing and new products to boost sales. "This is very reminiscent of the late '70s and early 1980s and we're dealing with the pressures of significant cost inflation, which has risen twice as fast in half the time, along with weak economies and related uncertain consumer behavior," William Johnson, Heinz chairman and chief executive, said during a meeting with analysts. But the current environment is different because of rapid growth in emerging markets and more interest by consumers in buying products with health and wellness benefits, he said. Johnson said emerging markets could represent 20 percent of Heinz sales by fiscal year 2013, while the company also touts its portfolio of tomato sauces, baked beans, soup, low-calorie meals and baby food as being one of the most health and wellness-oriented portfolios in the food industry. The company also expects to use acquisitions to increase its emerging markets and health and wellness businesses, Johnson said. Also on Thursday, Heinz raised its quarterly dividend by 9.2 percent to 41.5 cents a share. Heinz shares were up $1.32 at $48.87 on Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange. Through Wednesday, Heinz shares were are up 11 percent in the past year, in line with the increase in the Standard & Poor's U.S. packaged foods increase.
