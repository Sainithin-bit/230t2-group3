 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bear Stearns Cos Inc Chairman James Cayne on Thursday told the bank's employees and investors that he was "personally sorry" for the events that had unfolded, according to a shareholder who was at the meeting. 

 In a roughly five-minute meeting where shareholders of the 85-year-old investment bank voted to sell the company to JPMorgan Chase & Co, Cayne apologized and said a "hurricane" in the markets brought down the bank, the shareholder said. A spokesman for JPMorgan Chase said the deal was likely to close on Friday. (Reporting by  Joseph A. Giannone ; Writing by  Dan Wilchins ; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
