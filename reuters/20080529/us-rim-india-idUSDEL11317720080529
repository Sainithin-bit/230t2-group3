 NEW DELHI  (Reuters) - BlackBerry-maker Research In Motion met Indian officials on Thursday over the government's security concerns, two sources in the know of the matter said, but there was no official statement. 

 India's security agencies have said the BlackBerry e-mail device posed a risk as the mails could not be traced or intercepted.  Two officials from the Canadian High Commission in New Delhi were also seen at the headquarters of the telecoms ministry on Thursday. "There was a meeting, that is for sure," one source said. Another source also confirmed, but both were not present at the meeting and could not comment on any development. Media reports have said Canadian High Commission officials have been attending RIM's meetings with the Indian government to resolve this issue. Indian Telecoms Minister Andimuthu Raja said last week the Canadian firm had assured the government to provide a solution in two months. But last Friday, Research In Motion said in a customer update that the company does not have a copy of the customer's encryption key and would "simply be unable to accommodate" any such request.
