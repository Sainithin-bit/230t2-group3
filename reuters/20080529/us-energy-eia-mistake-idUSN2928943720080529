 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Thursday it accidentally released its weekly petroleum inventory data early on its website due to a "system malfunction." 

 "We're still trying to determine what exactly caused the data to go out early," said Jonathan Cogan, EIA spokesman, adding that changes to the system aimed at preventing future incidents will be announced by Monday. The weekly data is closely watched by oil traders for details of the health of inventories in the world's top consumer and can trigger significant changes in the price of oil on international markets. Thursday's EIA report, which showed the biggest weekly decline in U.S. crude stockpiles since September 2004, was briefly placed on the website and then taken down before 10:30 a.m. EDT (1430 GMT) when the data was officially released. The EIA has had problems with early data releases before. "We had a problem last year in August," said Cogan. (Reporting by  Richard Valdmanis , editing by Matthew Lewis)
