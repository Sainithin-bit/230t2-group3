 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil futures jumped more than $2 on Thursday, after the government's weekly inventory report showed crude supplies fell 8.8 million barrels last week, when forecasts had expected supplies to be little changed. 

 On the New York Mercantile Exchange at 10:38 a.m. EDT (1438 GMT), July crude CLN8 was up 90 cents at $131.93 per barrel, in volatile trading after jumping as high as $133.12 when the data was released, having bounced from an early low of  $128.50.
