 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. gasoline futures soared to a new intraday record on Thursday after the U.S. government said gasoline stocks fell last week by a much larger-than-expected amount. 

 On the New York Mercantile Exchange at 10:37 a.m. EDT (1437 GMT), RBOB gasoline for June delivery RBM8 was up 4.70 cents or 1.36 percent at $3.4946 a gallon, trading from $3.4040 to a record $3.52. The U.S. Energy Information Administration said that for the week to May 23, domestic gasoline stocks fell 3.2 million barrels to 206.2 million barrels last week, against forecasts for just a 200,000 barrel drawdown in a Reuters poll of analysts.
