 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Big Lots Inc ( BIG.N ) reported a higher-than-expected 20 percent rise in quarterly profit on Thursday after strong sales at older stores, and the retailer raised its full-year earnings forecast, sending its shares higher. 

 Net income rose to $34.5 million, or 42 cents per share, in the first quarter ended May 3 from $28.8 million, or 26 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had been expecting a profit of 37 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Earlier this month, the closeout retailer said sales at stores open at least two years, or same-store sales, rose 3.4 percent, helped by strong demand for furniture and consumable items like food and household cleaners. That was above an initial forecast for a gain of 1 percent to 2 percent. Net sales for the quarter rose more than 2 percent to $1.15 billion. Big Lots specializes in sales of excess inventory. As U.S. retailers face weak consumer demand, some have canceled orders for new products, leaving vendors with excess merchandise that is then sold to closeout retailers like Big Lots. Chief Executive Steve Fishman said the environment for finding products to sell in its stores is "overall very good," and a deal from a "major" furniture manufacturer and a national drugstore chain boosted its latest quarter's sales. "The amount of phone calls we are getting has picked up a little bit, but what we are seeing is deeper or bigger deals than we normally might have seen in the past," he said. The retailer forecast second-quarter same-store sales to rise 1 percent to 2 percent with fiscal full-year same-store sales growth of 2 percent. It expects second-quarter earnings per share of 21 cents to 25 cents from continuing operations, compared with analysts' current targets of 23 cents. The company now expects full-year earnings per share of $1.80 to $1.90 from continuing operations, up from an earlier view of $1.70 to $1.80. Big Lots said it has completed a $150 million share repurchase program and at this time prefers to use cash to pay down debt rather than buy back shares. Shares were up 7.3 percent, or $2.08, to $30.61 in morning New York Stock Exchange trading. (Reporting by Nicole Maestri; Editing by  Mark Porter  and Lisa Von Ahn)
