 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) is preparing to announce further restructuring to cut costs and conserve cash amid a downturn in U.S. truck sales, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter. 

 Chief Executive Rick Wagoner and top lieutenants are finalizing the moves, which have been discussed with the automaker's board, the Journal reported. Wagoner will announce the new restructuring measures at GM's annual shareholder meeting on June 3, the report said. "Obviously these times dictate more actions and Rick and the team are about doing that," GM's lead independent director, George Fisher, told the Journal in an interview. "Rick and the team are looking at what things can be done and will be done." New restructuring actions could include the elimination of some slow-selling models, the Journal reported. A GM spokeswoman was not immediately available for comment. (Reporting by  Lewis Krauskopf ; Editing by  Derek Caney )
