 LONDON  (Reuters) - Investors dumped safe-haven bonds in major economies on Thursday, pushing euro zone government borrowing costs to a nine-month high following upbeat U.S. economic data and inflation concerns from costly oil. 

 World stocks hit this week's high and the dollar rose broadly after Wednesday's data showed a jump in new orders for long-lasting U.S manufacturing goods outside the transportation sector. A gauge of business investment also posted a surprise rise. The data, which followed easing concerns about the credit crisis nine months after its initial outbreak, triggered a sell-off in U.S. Treasuries and Japanese government bonds. Euro zone government bonds followed suit, also pressured by data showing record Spanish inflation and Belgian annual inflation at a 23-year peak. "It is a globalize sell-off. This comes from quite big movements over the past days. It is a combination of the fact that growth is not as poor as feared in the U.S., combined with a renewed focus on inflation," said Neils From, chief analyst at Nordea in Copenhagen. "There has been a significant turnaround in the rhetoric from central banks for the past month and this changed the focus of the market. This is definitely pointing to major central banks being on hold or maybe raising rates." Two-year euro zone government bond yields rose as high as 4.303 percent, their highest since August. The June Bund future hit a fresh contract low. Euro zone 10-year bond break-even rates -- a gauge of inflation expectations -- blew out by around 10 basis points to their highest level in about three years. Ten-year U.S. Treasury yield rose to 4.073 percent for the first time since early January. In Japan, JGB futures tumbled to a 10-month low, pushing benchmark 10-year yields to a 10-month peak of 1.795 percent as investors dumped safe-haven bonds they had built up during the worst stretch of the credit crisis. Poorly received auctions on both sides of the Atlantic also soured sentiment for bonds. PASSING THE COST In a sign that companies are starting to pass on the cost of raw materials to customers, Dow Chemical ( DOW.N ), the biggest U.S. chemical manufacturer, said on Wednesday it would raise prices for all products by up to 20 percent, due to rising energy prices. Rising inflation concerns are prompting investors to price in a possibility that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates from the current 2 percent by December. The FTSEurofirst 300 index  .FTEU3  rose a quarter percent, while the MSCI main world equity index .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.3 percent, inching towards last week's four-month high. U.S. stock futures were down slightly, pointing to a weaker open on Wall Street later. The dollar rose 0.4 percent against a basket of major currencies .DXY to a 1-1/2 week high. "There have been some cumulative, albeit marginal, upside surprises in the data that have been encouraging dollar sentiment," said Phyllis Papadavid, FX strategist at Societe Generale. "In terms of the Fed, it is clear that the U.S. growth-inflation mix is not particularly positive. The Fed is aware of it and I think they are quite concerned about inflation prospects." Emerging sovereign spreads tightened 4 basis points while emerging stocks .MSCIEF rose 0.9 percent. U.S. light crude slipped below $130 a barrel, off last week's record high above $135. Gold, widely seen as an inflation hedge, followed oil lower to $892.50 an ounce. (Additional reporting by  Veronica Brown ; Editing by Gerrard Raven)
