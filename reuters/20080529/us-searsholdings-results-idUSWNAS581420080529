 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Retailer Sears Holdings Corp ( SHLD.O ) reported a quarterly loss on Thursday as sales fell at its Kmart and Sears, Roebuck divisions and markdowns hurt margins. 

 The company controlled by hedge fund manager Edward Lampert said its net loss came to $56 million, or 43 cents a share, in the first quarter ended on May 3, compared with a year-earlier profit of $223 million, or $1.45 a share. (Reporting by  Karen Jacobs ; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
