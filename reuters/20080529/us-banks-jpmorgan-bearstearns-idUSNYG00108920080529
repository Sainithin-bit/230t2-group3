 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said on Thursday it plans to conclude arrangements for the financing of JPMorgan Chase & Co's acquisition of Bear Stearns Companies Inc on or about June 26. 

 "The New York Fed, in coordination with JPMorgan Chase, is working carefully and expeditiously to put in place the operational arrangements necessary for the transfer of the portfolio to take place," the New York Fed's website said. "The New York Fed will provide an estimate of the current valuation of the portfolio at the time of the closing, on or about June 26," it added.
