 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - It's time to update the way you give to charity. 

 Americans are as charitable as they've ever been, according to the Chronicle of Philanthropy. Last year they donated some $62.7 billion to the largest U.S. charities -- matching the highest year-over-year percentage gain in gifts since the publication started tracking those numbers 16 years ago. But donors are different than they used to be. The idea of just writing one check to United Way is far less popular than it once was. So is the idea of sending dozens of small checks of $15 for every group's appeal that arrives in your mailbox. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation -- created by the Microsoft chairman and his family to help reduce inequities around the world -- has inspired many to start planning their donations the way they plan their retirements. At the same time, Congress used this year's pension legislation to tighten up the tax rules governing charitable gifts. Starting in 2007, the Internal Revenue Service will not allow write-offs for cash donations unless they are documented. Instead of tossing cash into that Salvation Army bucket, you'll have to write a check. And remember to save your checking account statement, since your bank probably isn't sending back your canceled checks anymore. Here's what you can do now to make sure your donations (and your tax deductions) work the way you want them to. -- Give now, choose later with a charitable gift fund run by a mutual fund company or broker. It's significant that the Fidelity Charitable Gift Fund (www.charitablegift.org/) was the sixth-biggest donation-getter in 2005, according to the Chronicle's figures. This fund and others like it run like this: The mutual fund itself is organized as a charitable organization. You can open an account and give it a name like "The Smith Family Fund" for instance. When you contribute to your account, you get a tax deduction for the amount of your contributions. You can leave the money there as long as you want and add to it whenever you want. It gets invested and grows. When you are ready to donate some or all of it, you simply let Fidelity know and the company cuts a check on your behalf. The charity knows it's you (or not, as you wish), but you don't get any additional tax break for the check that goes to the charity. Funds like this are also run by Charles Schwab (www.schwabcharitable.org/), T. Rowe Price (www.programforgiving.org/), and Vanguard Investments (www.vanguardcharitable.org/). These vehicles are good, and getting better. Fidelity recently lowered its minimum opening balance requirements to $5,000, and T. Rowe Price recently dropped the management fees on its Program for Charitable Giving to 0.5 percent a year; the lowest of all the major programs. To get an idea of how a program like this could work for you, think about this: Donate $5,000 a year to the fund, but don't take anything out for 10 years. If your account earns 8 percent a year, in the 11th year you'll have close to $90,000 to give away. That may be more than you'd ever give away all at once, but it would enable you to make a very big change at any charity of your choice. And it allows you to hurry up your deduction this year but take as much time as you want in choosing your charity. -- Give securities. If you've got earnings on a taxable investment, give the investment to charity before you sell it. You can even use shares of a mutual fund to start one of those charitable gift accounts. It works like this: Say you paid $6,000 for some shares of stock, and now it's worth $10,000. You can transfer the shares to a charity, which gets to sell them tax-free. You get the full $10,000 charitable deduction. If you sold the shares first, you'd have to pay capital gains taxes on the $4,000 profit, reducing your deductible gift to $9,400, not counting any commission you'd have to pay. -- Give fewer, more generous gifts. You might have a number of favorite charities, but try to limit that. Figure out which causes mean the most to you before you decide whom to fund, and then focus on those causes. Giving small amounts to many charities mutes the impact of your gift and encourages myriad charities to spend more and more money trying to get more out of you. -- Consider giving some money to a local community foundation or charity. Smaller bucks can go further in hometown charities like hunger and children's programs. They often have lower overhead than big national organizations. You can watch your money at work. -- Do your due diligence. Check out your chosen charities at  www.guidestar.org  to make sure they are legit before you write those checks. -- Learn the difference between spending and giving. Before the recent mid-term elections, you might have sent money to the party and candidates of your choice, but that's not tax deductible charitable spending; it's just politics. Giving to your church does count as a charitable gift; buying Girl Scout Cookies, not so much. -- Do write the checks. You'll want a record of how much you gave and when. Not just for your tax return, either. It's a safe bet that whatever charity you favor will be calling or writing within weeks to ask for more, so it would be nice to be able to say, "I just did that."
