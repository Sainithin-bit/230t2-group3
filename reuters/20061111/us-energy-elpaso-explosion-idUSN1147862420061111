 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - A natural gas pipeline owned by El Paso Corp. exploded on Saturday outside Cheyenne, Wyoming, after it was cut by a bulldozer, killing the driver, a sheriff's department spokesman said. 

 Gerry Luce, spokesman for the Laramie County Sheriff's Department, said the accident occurred in a remote area 9 miles southwest of the state capital, Cheyenne. Luce added the explosion sparked a huge fireball and set off a nearby grass fire but officials quickly extinguished both blazes. No one else was injured, although 13 workers were initially unaccounted for, Luce added. El Paso spokesman Richard Wheatley said he did not know when the pipeline serving Wyoming, Colorado and parts of the Midwest would be back on line but said any impact would likely be minimal because the company could use alternate pipelines.
