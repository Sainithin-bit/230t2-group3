 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - After a busy first year spent buying Pixar Animation Studios and slashing costs, Walt Disney Co. ( DIS.N ) Chief Executive Bob Iger is under pressure to produce a strong second act to keep profit growth in double-digits. 

 Quarterly results on Thursday pleased the Wall Street crowd, and Disney reiterated a double-digit earnings growth forecast for the fiscal year that opened in October. But investors sold off the stock on Friday on worries about whether Disney's performance will continue to justify a stock price that hit a five-year high the previous day. "Disney is selling off because people are afraid it's going to be hard to do an encore," said Jim Awad, chairman of Awad Asset Management in New York. A number of analysts said on Friday, however, that they expect Disney to maintain the strong growth, given its holiday DVD releases, the next "Pirates of the Caribbean" film in the summer and strength at the parks and television units. Iger took over last October from Michael Eisner, who after early success left with a mixed legacy from 21 years as CEO. Prudential Equity analyst Katherine Styponias wrote that she still saw Disney as the "best strategically and financially managed company in our entertainment coverage universe." She wrote in a note that she saw a greater chance of Disney exceeding Wall Street's fiscal 2007 targets than missing them. Analysts also forecast increases in advertising revenue in 2007 at Disney's top-rated ABC TV network and its ESPN sports cable network, which lately has enjoyed record ratings for its Monday Night Football franchise. Lower pension costs coupled with higher ticket prices and per-capita spending at Disney's theme parks could offset difficult comparisons with last year's record attendance from Disneyland's 50th Anniversary celebration promotions. "Performance of Disney's U.S. theme parks is the biggest concern," Merrill Lynch analyst Jessica Reif Cohen wrote in a note to clients on Friday. "Given strong booking trends in (the first quarter of 2007) and continued high occupancy rates, we do not expect a deterioration in the coming year." The company on Thursday reported flat advance bookings at domestic parks for the current quarter versus last year's record-setting holiday attendance. Sanders Morris Harris analyst David Miller had warned clients in a note that the market might "penalize" Disney on Friday since investors were used to seeing annual growth in advance bookings in the "high-single digits". Analysts were counting on Disney's summer movies, including Disney-Pixar's "Ratatouille" and a third "Pirates of the Caribbean," as well as DVD sales for "Cars" and the second "Pirates". Lower overhead and marketing costs from staff and film output cuts would further strengthen the studio division. Miller reiterated a "hold" rating on Disney shares and raised his fiscal 2007 earnings forecast, but said the stock was not as "blatantly attractive" as it was earlier this year. Disney stock is now up 35 percent this year, and trades at nearly 20 times estimated fiscal 2007 earnings, roughly in line with rivals News Corp. NWSa.N, and Time Warner Inc. ( TWX.N ). Reif Cohen, who has a "buy" rating on Disney, said in her note that she anticipated "continued operating momentum and an attractive long-term growth profile will drive the stock." Disney shares fell 3.5 percent to $32.40 on Friday. (Additional reporting by  Ellis Mnyandu  in New York)
