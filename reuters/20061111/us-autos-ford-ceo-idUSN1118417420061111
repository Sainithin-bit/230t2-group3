 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) is "a little bit ahead" of schedule in settling buyout offers with its 75,000 unionized factory workers, the automaker's chief executive told the Detroit Free Press in an interview published on Saturday. 

 Alan Mulally, who took over as Ford's top executive about six weeks ago, was also quoted by the Detroit News as saying that the embattled No. 2 U.S. carmaker needs to make its North American operations profitable by 2009. "We have got to turn around North America and be profitable by 2009," Mulally was quoted as saying. "Because if not, you just keep losing cash and pretty soon you run out." Both interviews were given on Friday, according to the newspapers. All of Ford's blue-collar workers represented by the United Auto Workers union have been offered buyout packages to leave the company's payroll. Those offers, which are central to Ford's plan to cut costs in response to its sliding market share, are open to consideration until November 27. "I would say we are a little bit ahead (of schedule)," Mulally told the Detroit Free Press. "We're getting a really good response about the way we're doing it and that they have choices and they can do it in a timely manner and move on or stay." Ford's larger rival, General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ), surprised Wall Street analysts earlier this year when it convinced some 28,000 of its unionized workers to take a similar buyout package. Some industry observers had questioned whether Ford would have equivalent success with the program given that its workforce is younger on average than GM's. 'LEVERAGE AND SIMPLIFY' Separately, Mulally said in his interviews with the Detroit newspapers that he had not decided whether to shed some of Ford's car brands. But he indicated that there was potential to cut costs by streamlining Ford's management and planning process. "There is no plan to do that tomorrow," he told the Detroit News. "But we have got to leverage and simplify and use the resources we have around the world." The Detroit Free Press quoted Mulally as saying he saw unlimited potential to save money by simplifying and unifying Ford's operating structure, which is now broken up by geography and product line. "We have a lot of opportunity to improve. We have a global stage," he told the newspaper. "We have all these separate companies. Just think if we were lean." Mulally, a former Boeing Co. ( BA.N ) executive who was named Ford CEO in early September and went to work full-time in October, said he admired Toyota Motor Corp.'s ( 7203.T ) efficiency. "They make products that people want and they do it with less resources and less time than anybody else in the world," he told the Detroit News. "They're a magical machine."
