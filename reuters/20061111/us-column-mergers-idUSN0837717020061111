 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Big buyout deals can come with their own problems aside from getting financing, industry experts say, which can derail plans before they even hit the negotiating table. 

 Antitrust and regulation issues can be harder to overcome with mega-sized deals -- as seen recently when a $50 billion bid approach to French conglomerate Vivendi ( VIV.PA ) fell apart partly over tax issues, according to sources last week. In addition, breaking up a conglomerate or spinning it off whole at a higher price is a tougher job with a bigger deal. That's on top of concerns about the increased risk taken on as financial sponsors pay higher prices as targets become more scarce. Multi-billion dollar leveraged buyouts (LBOs) have become the norm as high liquidity in the global financial system has sent cash rushing into the private equity sector. Deal size has rocketed as financial sponsors club together on bids, with a buyout group recently clinching a $21 billion deal to buy No. 1. U.S. hospital operator HCA Inc. ( HCA.N ). "The sheer enormity of those numbers are frankly scary," said Anthony Sabino, Professor of Law & Business at St. John's University. "When you're talking deals of that size, you're talking debt of that size. It's larger than that of many sovereign nations. It's dangerous." BIG DEAL, HIGH RISK Sabino argues that the bigger the deal, the higher the risk, and that even buying a large, well-established company doesn't eliminate concern about debt taken on. But the sheer scale of deals being drawn up raises wider issues than simply getting the cash lined up. Vivendi said on Saturday that private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. KKR.UL had been interested in buying its business but talks had ended. Talks were abandoned partly because of French tax laws and other complications, according to a source at the time, as the deal would require approvals of several governments including France. Pushing a big deal through different regulatory jurisdictions creates complexity that an LBO of a smaller company with less established overseas operations may not encounter. Issues can also arise as private equity shops build up their own portfolios and consolidate new acquisitions with existing companies. "Evidently the larger companies are going to be facing larger anti-trust issues," said Howard Morgan, managing director of private equity firm Castle Harlan Inc., which invests in medium-sized deals. Exiting a mega-deal can be more problematic than smaller LBOs, as sponsors look to either break the company up or sell it whole to a new consortium, said Peter Spratt, managing director of PricewaterhouseCoopers Corporate Advisory and Restructuring. DEBT WORRIES Global acquisitions by private equity firms totaled $554 billion so far this year, up from $354 billion for the full year 2005 and only $72 billion in 2001, according to research firm Dealogic. The price buyout firms are paying for companies has also risen -- making it harder to achieve high returns. This year, financial sponsors have paid an average 19.2 times companies' earnings, versus 15.3 times earnings in 2005 and 11.4 in 2001. Levering a company up with debt diminishes its ability to deal with bumps in performance, said Steven Siesser, Chairman of law firm Lowenstein Sandler's specialty finance group. "With the super-mega deals you've got larger bank groups who are probably less forgiving on covenant default -- that makes it more difficult and harder for these companies to weather any hiccups in their natural cycle," Siesser said. Spratt expects to see restructurings ahead, with over-leveraged companies missing targets and falling into distressed situations. He said PwC has the critical mass in terms of staffing to deal with at least "the first wave". Sabino also foresees rough water. "There's still too much good money that's going to be chasing bad deals. The low-hanging fruit has already been picked and I don't know what's on the top of the tree." The pitfalls won't stop the flow of deal ideas, but might cut the amount that are completed. "From the time the deal is sufficiently public to completion I think the failure rate is probably relatively small," said PwC's Spratt. "The things we don't see is the failure rate of the initial concepts as they're bandied around over the dinner table between various hedge funds -- and I suspect that failure rate is pretty high."
