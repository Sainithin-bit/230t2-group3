 DUBAI  (Reuters) - State-owned investment agency Dubai International Capital (DIC) said on Saturday it was considering selling some of its shares in DaimlerChrysler AG DCXGn.DE DCX.N now that they were trading above 45 euros ($57.92) each. 

 "At these levels, between 45 and 50, we believe there is an opportunity to do a partial exit," DIC Chief Executive Sameer al-Ansari told reporters in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Shares of the Stuttgart, Germany-based auto maker DaimlerChrysler, of which DIC is the third-largest shareholder, closed at 45.97 euros on Friday. DIC bought about 20 million shares of DaimlerChrysler in January 2005 at 32 euros each, Ansari said. He declined to say how many shares DIC may sell or when.
