 PARIS  (Reuters) - Alstom ( ALSO.PA ) has withdrawn its legal challenge to a major Paris suburban train contract after Canadian rival Bombardier doubled the French engineering group's share of the $3.4 billion deal, Alstom said in a statement. 

 Alstom will now take around a third of the work, up from the 15 percent it was initially to have been awarded by Bombardier ( BBDb.TO ), according to the statement released late on Friday. Last month, Bombardier won a contract to supply the French state-owned railways SNCF with an initial 172 trains valued at $1.7 billion, and another 200 trains to be delivered later for a total value of $3.4 billion. Alstom sought an injunction against the deal in the Paris Administrative Court on October 30, questioning whether the tender had been conducted according to the rules. The court had been due to rule on the case on November 20. "Negotiations took place between Bombardier and Alstom to determine the modalities of the cooperation for this project," Alstom's statement said. "Alstom has decided to withdraw its injunction request after Bombardier gave undertakings on the terms of this cooperation. "The share to be carried out by Alstom is estimated at one third of the overall contract, and will be carried out with a reasonable margin," it added. Alstom said it had taken the decision to avoid delaying renewal of Paris region rolling stock. The new trains are due to begin running in 2009, and before 2015 they will have replaced more than 20 percent of the current regional network trains. Alstom has regained financial health after a controversial state-backed bail-out in 2004, and in April construction to telecoms group Bouygues ( BOUY.PA ) agreed to buy the state's stake and now holds 24 percent of Alstom.
