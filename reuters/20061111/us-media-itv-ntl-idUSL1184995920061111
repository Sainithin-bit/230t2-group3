 LONDON  (Reuters) - British cable operator NTL Inc NTLI.O is expected to bid mostly in cash for rival broadcaster ITV ( ITV.L ), a source familiar with the matter said on Saturday. 

 The companies are due to meet in coming days, with NTL outlining more details of its 5 billion pound ($9.6 billion) plus offer , the source said. It is likely to discuss tabling a bid that would value ITV at between 110 and 130 pence per share, at a premium to ITV's share price, as well as an equity alternative to limit the increase in NTL's debt burden, the source said. However, it was too early for a definitive detailed proposal and the terms were still being decided and might change. ITV's share price stood at 105-1/2 pence before news of the approach leaked out and ended at 111p on Friday, valuing ITV at around 4.3 billion pounds, excluding almost 1 billion of debt. The Financial Times said that while NTL's valuation of NTL was unclear, analysts said it would be aware of a 130p a share private equity approach in March and of a 20 percent slide in analysts' 2007 earnings forecasts since then. A spokeswoman for ITV said the group could not add anything further to Thursday's statement when it confirmed that it had received a "highly tentative expression of interest in holding discussions about a possible combination of NTL with ITV". NTL declined to comment. The Daily Telegraph said on Saturday that NTL's approach was understood to have put a 115p to 120p a share price tag on ITV, adding that senior management from both companies were expected to have their first meeting this weekend. The Times reported at least one private equity firm, CVC, was evaluating whether it would make a move on ITV.
