 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Most investors choose their stocks and mutual funds carefully -- and then forget about them. 

 They add to the mix without subtracting. Years go by, and they may look at their statements and say: "When did I buy that?" or "I still own that?" Folks, it's time to prune. The end of the year is the perfect time to organize what you own and get rid of what you no longer want. Here's how: -- Put it on your calendar. Start by setting aside a block of time, say a couple of hours, to collect the information you need and set guidelines for analyzing your investments. You can review everything you own in one marathon session, or devote 30 minutes every day to review one or two investments. -- Start by examining your investment philosophy and goals. Do you believe you can choose stocks and actively managed funds that beat the indexes? Or do you believe that less managing means lower fees and eventually a better performance? Are you saving for the long term or stashing away money you'll need within five years for college or a down payment? Once you answer these questions, you'll have a clearer idea of how individual securities fit - or don't fit - your plans. -- Do a tax analysis, or ask your broker to do one for you. Sell securities that will produce a loss that you can use on your tax return. This may mean selling your entire holding of a stock, or selling only certain identified shares of a mutual fund. -- Look for duplication. Do you have five stock funds that all seem to be dominated by shares of Pfizer, General Electric, Home Depot and Citigroup? Unless you can find a good reason why you own so many different funds that act similarly, sell the four that are less worthy (perhaps they have weaker performances or higher fees) and consolidate that money into the best fund. What about multiple stocks that achieve the same portfolio goal? Maybe you like bank stocks, and so you own several different ones. That's OK. On the other hand, if you find yourself buying various versions of what's essentially the same stock over and over again, pick the best and prune the rest. -- Would you buy it now? That's the toughest question investors have to ask themselves because they get emotionally involved in the stocks that they own. But evaluate your holdings by the same criteria that caused you to buy them. Are they still attractively priced? Is the company's story still persuasive? Is it a good value, relative to its cash on hand, its earnings and other companies in its same niche? If the answer to all of your questions is "no," then maybe the next thing you say should be "sell." -- Find a balance. Theoretically, your portfolio is structured to fit a certain asset allocation. You may have initially decided, for example, to have 40 percent in large U.S. stocks, 20 percent in small U.S. stocks, 20 percent in foreign stocks and 20 percent in bonds. But every year, that gets skewed when some asset classes do well and others don't. This year, your foreign funds and your large-cap stock funds have probably far outstripped your small companies and your bonds. You may find you want to get rid of some of the winning shares and invest more in securities where the price is right. -- Give away stock. Want to get rid of some shares that will produce a taxable gain? Here are a couple of alternatives. Give the stock to your college-student children instead of tuition. If they're over 18, they can sell it, pay a tax based on their (presumably lower) income tax rate, and then use the proceeds to make that tuition payment. Or give the shares to the charity of your choice instead of writing a check. You'll get the full deduction, and your charity won't have to pay taxes on the proceeds. -- Start looking for your next purchase. Discover any holes in your portfolio? Now you know what to shop for in the new year.
