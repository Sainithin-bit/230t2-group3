 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) hopes to capture up to 40 percent of the customers for its new Buick Enclave from rival brands as it pushes to reestablish Buick in the luxury car market, a spokesman said on Friday. 

 "We are very encouraged we will draw customers from competitors," Buick spokesman Dave Darovitz said. "It could be as high as 40 percent, although it's always hard to put a number on that." The 2008 Enclave, a five-door luxury crossover sport utility vehicle, will compete with Honda Motor Co. Ltd's ( 7267.T ) Acura MDX, Toyota Motor Corp.'s ( 7203.T ) Lexus RX 350 and DaimlerChrysler AG's DCXGn.DE Mercedes R Class 350. While Buick has not announced the pricing of the model yet, Darovitz said the new Enclave would be "several thousand dollars cheaper" than the 2007 Acura MDX, which has a base price of $39,995. The world's largest automaker will use cutting-edge soundproofing technology to make the vehicle one of the quietest on the road, Darovitz said. Global Insight analyst George Magliano said he had "very high" expectations for the Enclave because of its fuel efficiency and smooth ride. "GM is basically is moving into a segment all on its own," he said, referring to the large crossover SUV segment. Sales of car-based "crossover" utility vehicles -- which offer the high ride and roomy cabins of an SUV with the handling and fuel mileage of a passenger car -- are on track to reach 2.4 million units this year, according to analysts. The segment has been one of the few bright spots in a slowing U.S. auto market. Overall sales have dropped 3 percent so far this year and many analysts expect the slump to deepen in 2007. GM, which lost $10.6 billion last year, is trying to reverse a slide in market share in part by more sharply differentiating its eight brands to reduce the overlap of models. GM is working to group the GMC and Buick brands under one dealership, making Buick the luxury brand. Buick's U.S. sales fell 15 percent in the first 10 months of 2006. "The Enclave will bring Buick back," Darovitz said. GM will build the Enclave at a plant near Lansing, Michigan. The new vehicle goes on sale in mid-2007, but GM will unveil the production version this month at the Los Angeles Auto Show. Golf star Tiger Woods, who signed a five year promotional deal with GM, is expected to be central to the marketing effort for the Enclave, which GM hopes will take Buick to a younger and more affluent set of buyers. IRN Inc. analyst Erich Merkle said the Enclave showed the strength of GM's pipeline of launches under the automaker's product chief Bob Lutz. "The Enclave is really the first true Lutz product for Buick," Merkle said. Merkle expected the three GM crossovers that share the same platform -- the Outlook, Acadia and Enclave -- could sell over 200,000 units in their first year on a combined basis. "What's important is that they finally have some crossovers that are going to be profitable," he said of GM. Merkle said a full revival for the Buick brand would depend on the launch of new sedans for the brand that are not expected to arrive until 2009. "The Enclave is definitely a huge leap in the right direction," he said. (Additional reporting by  Poornima Gupta  and  Kevin Krolicki )
