 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Shares of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEH.N fell more than 7 percent to their lowest level in more than five years on Tuesday, a day after the investment bank raised dilutive capital and warned of a $2.8 billion quarterly loss. 

 Lehman shares slipped as much as 9.2 percent, before closing down $1.98, or 6.7 percent, at $27.50 on the New York Stock Exchange. On Monday, the stock fell 8.7 percent after Lehman estimated a much steeper-than-expected loss of $2.8 billion for its fiscal second quarter, due to losses from trading and hedging. The Wall Street firm also raised $6 billion through an offering of common and convertible preferred stock to shore up capital. Several brokers, including Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, UBS and Wachovia, slashed their 2008 earnings estimates for the firm on Tuesday. Oppenheimer & Co analyst Meredith Whitney said in a research note the capital raised is 30 percent dilutive to existing shareholders. "The sheer size of such a dilutive capital raise will put serious pressure on the bank's ability to deliver on meaningful earnings-per-share growth over the near to medium term," Whitney wrote.
