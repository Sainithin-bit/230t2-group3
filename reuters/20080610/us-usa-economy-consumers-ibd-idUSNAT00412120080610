 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence sank to a record low in June as a surge in gasoline prices to more than $4 a gallon and a jump in the unemployment rate helped torpedo a modest rebound in Americans' outlook seen the previous month, according to a survey released on Tuesday. 

 Investor's Business Daily and TechnoMetrica Market Intelligence said their IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index fell to 37.4 in June from 40.3 in May. A reading below 50 indicates pessimism among survey respondents. "Without a doubt, the relentless increase in gasoline prices has Americans spooked about the health of the economy," said Raghavan Mayur, president of TIPP. The survey organizers also cited as negative factors the biggest jump in the U.S. unemployment rate in 22 years in May, to 5.5 percent from 5 percent, and the ongoing housing slump. None of the 21 demographic groups polled had an optimistic outlook for the economy, the report said. It was just the second reading ever below 40 in the 89 months since the survey's inception. June's reading puts the index 28 percent below its lifetime average of 52.1, IBD/TIPP said in a statement. The IBD/TIPP surveyed more than 900 adults in early June. (Editing by  James Dalgleish )
