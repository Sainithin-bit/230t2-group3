 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - One of the biggest U.S. money managers said on Tuesday the Federal Reserve was unlikely to raise interest rates despite surging oil prices until the U.S. economy shows more signs of stabilization. 

 "We don't think the Fed will be raising interest rates anytime soon," said Bob Doll, chief investment officer for equities and also vice chairman of BlackRock ( BLK.N ), which managed $1.36 trillion in assets at the end of March. "The Fed is on hold for the indefinite future," Doll said during a Hong Kong news conference. He added that recent comments from Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke were meant to signal to investors the U.S. central bank is well aware of the inflationary effects of the weak dollar, not to flag an imminent increase in its benchmark interest rate. Candid comments about the risk of higher inflation from the weak dollar and high oil prices last week and on Tuesday from Bernanke have roiled financial markets, particularly since they came amid data showing the biggest jump in U.S. unemployment in 22 years. The Fed has cut its fed funds rate seven times since mid-September 2007 for a cumulative 325 basis points. Doll said the U.S. economy will likely skirt a recession but will remain in a "profits recession" in which both the financial and consumer goods sectors will post losses for the year. The European Central Bank could lower interest rates because of lingering credit-related problems and difficulty in spurring growth, Doll said. "If we are right about growth remaining slow in Europe and some credit problems remaining, it's not out of the question that the ECB could lower rates," he said. ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet said last week that it was "possible" that interest rates could rise as early as July, causing many economists to rejig their forecasts. Doll said it was concerning that some emerging economies are tightening monetary policy at a time when global growth is below its long-term trend. However, he said that equity valuations in China had returned to more reasonable levels and deserved more attention. (Reporting by  Kevin Plumberg ; editing by Anne Marie Roantree)
