 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - The chief executive officer of XTO Energy Inc XTO.N said on Tuesday he expects the company to spend at least $1 billion to $1.5 billion on additional acquisitions in 2008. 

 "That is sort of a minimum I see us doing for the rest of the year," Bob Simpson, the Fort Worth, Texas, company's CEO, told analysts on a conference call. "It's just midyear, and lots of deals are coming." Earlier on Tuesday, XTO said it would buy privately held Hunt Petroleum Corp for $4.2 billion in cash and stock.
