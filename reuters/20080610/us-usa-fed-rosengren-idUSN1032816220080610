 HARWICH, Massachusetts  (Reuters) - Rising food and energy costs are still trickling through the economy, complicating the outlook for inflation, Boston Federal Reserve President Eric Rosengren said on Tuesday. 

 The central bank still expects prices to trend down as the economy softens, but it is less confident in this outlook because of simmering commodity costs, Rosengren said in a speech in Cape Cod. "The effects of significant increases in food and energy prices are still feeding through the economy, as are the impacts of appropriately aggressive monetary and fiscal policy responses to the recent financial turmoil," he said. The United States has been struggling with twin crises in the housing and financial sectors, developments that have forced the Fed to cut interest rates sharply since September. Investors now believe the central bank will leave benchmark rates on hold at their current 2 percent level. Tough talk on inflation from a string of Fed officials have also prompted the markets to begin pricing in an eventual rate hike, as early as October. The economy has barely sputtered forward in the last two quarters. Last week, the government reported a jump in the unemployment rate from 5.1 percent to 5.5 percent, the biggest one-month rise in 22 years. At the same time, oil prices have reached a record high near $139 a barrel and the average cost of gasoline nationally has surpassed $4 a gallon for the first time. These trends should slow growth, but also put upward pressure on prices. DON'T BLAME THE BUCK Many analysts have linked soaring oil prices to the fall in the dollar. Since oil is priced in the U.S. currency, the theory goes, it automatically adjusts higher as the greenback plummets. Rosengren downplayed this view, saying the relationship was not so crystal clear. "The strength of the statistical correlation between the exchange rate and oil prices is modest at best," he said. Rosengren argued that total inflation, not the so-called core rate, is really what monetary policy should target over the long-run. He noted core is often employed as a decent approximation, but conceded that it has had its problems as an adequate indicator of the future. Still, Rosengren appeared confident that inflation would eventually respond to a weaker economy, reiterating the Fed's forecast for both headline and core personal expenditure costs to come down to or below 2 percent over the next two years. "That said, it seems to be taking quite a long time to date for long-run supply and demand influences to rein in oil price increases," he said.
