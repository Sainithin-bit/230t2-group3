 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A plan to sell Chicago's Wrigley Field baseball stadium to an Illinois state authority stalled on Monday after Tribune, the ballpark's owner, clashed with the state over how to finance the deal. 

 The Illinois Sports Facilities Authority (ISFA) said Tribune believes the acquisition would require the transfer of sales and amusement tax revenue from Wrigley Field for the next 30 years. The authority also said that Tribune thinks the deal would require new taxes or transferring funds the authority has already pledged to projects at another baseball stadium on Chicago's South Side. "ISFA cannot agree to this," said the group's chairman, former Illinois Gov. James Thompson. Tribune said in a statement the authority's plan to buy and restore the field would violate the rules of Major League Baseball, and would not be in the interests of its employees. Wrigley is home to the Chicago Cubs baseball team, which Tribune is trying to sell. U.S. Cellular Field, owned by the state authority, is home to the Chicago White Sox. Thompson said the authority was ready to resume negotiations with Tribune or whomever buys the Cubs. Tribune is planning to release financial data to potential bidders for the Cubs, at least some of whom also want to buy Wrigley Field. The state authority proposed buying Wrigley by issuing taxable bonds that would be paid for by lease revenue from the Cubs and the naming rights to the field. It also said it could restore the ballpark by selling equity rights to seats at the stadium. "This would be done within the policies and rules of Major League Baseball," Thompson said in the statement. "This would cost Illinois taxpayers nothing." Tribune aims to sell the field, team, as well as a stake in Comcast SportsNet, and bring in as much as $1 billion. The newspaper publisher and broadcaster would use this to pay back some of the billions of dollars in debt it took on when it went private in a deal led by Chicago real estate tycoon Sam Zell. Without selling the team, the ballpark and more properties, the Chicago-based company risks defaulting on its debt. Tribune already agreed to sell some of its property, including Long Island, New York's Newsday daily newspaper, to Cablevision Systems Corp for $650 million. The company, which publishes the Chicago Tribune and Los Angeles Times, last week unveiled a plan to producer thinner papers and reallocate the ratio of advertising and editorial content in each of its papers. It is changing the papers to make them less expensive to produce, and also altering their physical look in a bid to make them more attractive to readers. Job cuts among news and business staff are likely. (Editing by  Braden Reddall )
