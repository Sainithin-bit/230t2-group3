 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit widened more than expected in April as the average price for imported oil jumped to a record $96.81 per barrel and U.S. exports and imports also set records, a Commerce Department report showed on Tuesday. 

 The monthly trade gap grew nearly 7.8 percent to $60.9 billion from a downwardly revised $56.5 billion in March. The gain was the biggest since September 2005. Wall Street analysts had forecast a smaller rise in the trade gap to $59.9 billion, from the previous March figure of $58.2 billion. Average prices for imported oil rose $6.96 per barrel in April, the second highest increase on record. Imports from Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries totaled a record $20.9 billion. Overall U.S. imports of goods and services were a record $216.4 billion, and showed their biggest one-month gain since November 2002. Although oil accounted for much of the increase, imports of autos and capital goods bounced back from a drop in March. U.S. exports also rebounded to a record $155.5 billion in April after retreating slightly in March. The month-to-month rise was the biggest in more than four years. The weak dollar has helped push U.S. exports higher over the last several years, keeping the U.S. economy afloat during a severe housing market downturn and liquidity crisis. This week, China's ambassador to the World Trade Organization said the weak U.S. dollar was hurting developing countries by fueling increases in oil and food prices and he called on Washington to take quick action to stabilize its currency. That criticism follows years of U.S. complaints that China maintains an artificially low currency exchange rate, giving Chinese companies a big price advantage in international trade. Top level U.S. and Chinese economic officials will discuss currency, trade and other bilateral economic issues in talks outside Washington next week. The U.S. trade gap with China increased nearly 26 percent in April to $20.2 billion, as imports from that country surged and U.S. exports to China slumped.
