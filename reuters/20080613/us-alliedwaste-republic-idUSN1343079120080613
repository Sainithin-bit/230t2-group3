 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Trash company Republic Services Inc ( RSG.N ) is in talks to buy competitor Allied Waste Industries Inc AW.N in an all-stock deal worth about $6.77 billion, the companies said on Friday. 

 The acquisition would unite the No. 2 and No. 3 U.S. waste haulers to compete with industry leader Waste Management Inc WMI.N. Under the terms of the deal, Allied Waste shareholders would receive 0.45 shares of Republic Services common stock, the companies said in a statement without any additional detail. At Friday's closing price, the offer is worth $15.23 per share to Allied. That is only a 1 percent premium to Allied's closing price on Friday but a 9.4 percent premium to the price at Thursday's close. As of March 31, the weighted average common and common equivalent shares of Allied Waste outstanding were 444.2 million. Shares in Republic Services closed up 19 cents to $33.85. Allied Waste shares finished up $1.08, or 7.8 percent, at $15. Both stocks trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
