 BANGALORE  (Reuters) - KeyCorp ( KEY.N ), a large U.S. Midwest regional bank, said on Friday it raised $1.65 billion, 10 percent more than planned, from offerings of common stock and preferred shares to bolster its capital base. 

 A day earlier KeyCorp said it planned to raise capital, cut its dividend in half, and said an adverse federal court ruling on the taxation of leveraged-lease transactions would lead to a $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion charge. Shares of the bank tumbled 23.7 percent on Thursday. The lowered dividend ended 43 straight years of increases. KeyCorp said it offered $1 billion of common stock, consisting of 85.1 million shares priced at $11.75 each. In addition, $650 million of preferred shares were priced with a 7.75 percent dividend yield and convertible into stock at $14.10 per share, 20 percent above the price of the common stock offering. The bank said net proceeds totaled about $1.6 billion. It also said both offerings might increase 15 percent to meet demand, boosting the gross amount raised to $1.9 billion. The offerings dilute existing shareholdings. KeyCorp is the latest of many U.S. banking companies this year to raise capital and lower their dividends, including Citigroup Inc ( C.N ), Wachovia Corp WB.N, Washington Mutual Inc ( WM.N ) and Cleveland-based National City Corp NCC.N. Chief Executive Henry Meyer said the offerings were significantly oversubscribed, and that the capital-raising "restores our capital ratios and better positions the company for current economic conditions and future growth opportunities." But several analysts lowered their price targets for KeyCorp, which has been hurt by its exposure to lending in commercial real estate and to homebuilders. Some said the bank might need to raise even more capital. "Given our expectation for further credit deterioration throughout 2008, we would not rule out further action by management to maintain capital adequacy," wrote Gerard Cassidy, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. He cut his price target per share to $10 from $15. Shares of KeyCorp fell 13 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $11.85 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. KeyCorp has about 985 branches in 13 U.S. states. Despite the demand, KeyCorp's preferred shares priced at the expensive end of the expected ranges. KeyCorp had forecast a 7.25 percent to 7.75 percent dividend yield, and a 20 percent to 25 percent conversion premium. Through Thursday, KeyCorp shares had fallen 67.7 percent from their 52-week high set last July 18. (Editing by Gerald E. McCormick and Steve Orlofsky)
