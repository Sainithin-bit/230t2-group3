 BANGALORE  (Reuters) - Wachovia Corp WB.N shares fell as much as 10.2 percent to their lowest level since 1992 on concern the fourth-largest U.S. bank might cut its dividend a second time, and after another mortgage lender with heavy exposure to California reported a jump in nonperforming assets. 

 Friday's decline came after Lehman Brothers Inc analyst Jason Goldberg wrote that Wachovia was among large banks "relatively poorly positioned" to maintain its dividend, based on dividend yields and payouts, as well as capital levels. Wachovia in April raised $8.05 billion of capital and cut its dividend 41 percent after a surge in losses tied to its portfolio of option adjustable-rate mortgages. The Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank took on many of these when it paid $24.2 billion in 2006 for the Oakland, California, lender Golden West Financial Corp. Meanwhile, another option ARM specialist, Newport Beach, California-based Downey Financial Corp ( DSL.N ), said on Friday nonperforming assets represented 14.33 percent of all assets at the end of May, up elevenfold from 1.3 percent a year earlier, and up from 13.24 percent in April. Nonperforming assets may be defined as those no longer collecting interest or principal payments. They often include loans more than 90 days overdue. Wachovia spokeswoman Christy Phillips-Brown declined to comment. In late afternoon trading, shares of Wachovia were down $1.13, or 5.85 percent, to $18.18 on the New York Stock Exchange, after earlier falling to $17.34. The bank's $1.50 per share annual dividend equated on Thursday to a dividend yield of about 7.77 percent. Mounting credit losses, as well as unrelated legal and regulatory problems, led earlier this month to the ouster of Ken Thompson as Wachovia's chief executive after eight years at the helm. Wachovia has yet to name a replacement. Through Thursday, Wachovia shares had fallen 64.5 percent from their 52-week high of $54.43 set last June 19, Reuters data shows. The KBW Bank Index .BKX, which includes Wachovia, had fallen 43.3 percent over that time. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel; Editing by  Brian Moss )
