 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Asahi Breweries Ltd aims to almost quadruple its overseas revenue to 200 billion yen ($1.86 billion) within five years from 55.4 billion yen in 2007 as it tries to offset declining alcohol consumption at home. 

 "We would like to raise our overseas sales to 200 billion yen, and we should not take five or 10 years to achieve that," said Asahi president Hitoshi Ogita in an interview with Reuters. The maker of "Super Dry" beer is the leader in Japan's beer market with a 37.9 percent share in 2007, but its group revenue and profits trail those of rival Kirin Holdings Co Ltd, which has been better at adapting to a changing market. In 2007, domestic beer sales accounted for 60 percent of Asahi's overall sales and overseas revenue stood at 4 percent. The figures for Kirin were 43.6 percent and 15.8 percent, respectively. Asahi and its Japanese rivals are trying to compete with global mega-brewers for customers as well as increasingly costly raw materials amid drastic consolidation in the beer market. InBev has launched a $46.3 billion bid to buy Anheuser-Busch as it seeks to create the world's largest brewer with the biggest-ever takeover of an alcoholic drinks company. "The situation will be tougher if super-big companies become even bigger," Ogita said. While Asahi wants to expand, it is unlikely to consider large-scale acquisitions. "Our active stance has not changed, but there is a limit to it," he said. "We cannot afford to pay something like 1 trillion yen or 2 trillion. We would go bankrupt." He said his firm would consider taking a stake in Vietnam's top brewer Saigon Beer Alcohol Beverage Corp (Sabeco), but added that it has not been officially approached on that matter. Asahi is expanding its overseas beer business by giving production and marketing licenses to local breweries such as Russia's Baltika Breweries. Rising prices of barley, malt and other materials are putting pressure on Asahi, which expects such costs to increase by some 20 billion yen this year, on top of a 10 billion yen increase last year. Ogita does not expect Japanese beer makers to team up and jointly procure raw materials because of different needs. Ogita, who headed the group's non-alcohol beverage unit before becoming president in 2006, said the firm would aim to expand its soft drink business as a second earnings driver. Asahi has been overshadowed by Coca-cola and Suntory Ltd, who dominate the Japanese market also due to the sheer number of vending machines, a key retail channel in Japan. Ogita said the firm is looking for acquisitions or alliances with strong brands in areas where it does not have much presence, such as the popular green tea sector.
