 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Lehman Brothers' LEH.N shares surged 10.5 percent on Friday, snapping back after five days of declines, as investors looking for cheap stocks bought shares and some short-sellers closed out their positions. 

 The investment bank's shares fell by nearly a third between last Friday and Thursday's close, after it said on Monday that it expected to post a roughly $2.8 billion quarterly loss and about $3.7 billion of writedowns. On Thursday, the company demoted its chief financial officer and chief operating officer amid a crisis of confidence in the bank's management. At Thursday's close, Lehman's shares traded at less than 70 percent of their book value, or the company's net accounting value. That valuation often brings value investors into the market, analysts said. "People do not expect Lehman to go the way of Bear Stearns," said Helena Ocampo, an analyst at Sentinel Investments in Montpelier, Vermont, which does not own Lehman shares. Bear Stearns collapsed in March after a run on the bank, and was forced to sell itself to JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ) for a pittance, a deal that closed in May. But Lehman Brothers has about $100 billion of cash, assets it can easily sell, or assets it can easily finance. It raised $6 billion on Monday in a deal that closed on Thursday. Additionally, the Federal Reserve is providing short-term funding to investment banks that need it. Some investors have been shorting Lehman recently, or selling borrowed shares with the hope of buying them back in the future at a lower price. After the recent drop in Lehman's shares, at least some of those investors are likely closing out their short positions, analysts said. Lehman's shares rose $2.41 to $25.11 on Friday morning.
