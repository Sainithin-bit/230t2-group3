 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The New York Stock Exchange plans to modify the role of specialist traders on the exchange floor, giving them fewer privileges, but more freedom in the way they trade, The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday. 

 The changes by the NYSE Euronext NYX.N unit, to be unveiled on Friday, would further overhaul the role that 'specialist' traders play, the Journal said. Specialists are floor traders that match buyers and sellers on the New York Stock Exchange floor to manage volatility. Late last year, the NYSE began to rethink the role of specialists, who have been so named since 1871. The move reflects the changing face of the NYSE, which has become increasingly electronic as rivals such as Nasdaq Stock Market Inc ( NDAQ.O ) eat away at its market share. Specialists would become 'designated market makers' under the new rules, and would no longer be able to have their own computer algorithms receive electronic orders before the orders are displayed publicly, the paper said. "The current system doesn't work very well," the Journal quoted Lawrence Leibowitz, head of U.S. markets at NYSE, as saying. "This positions the specialist to actually add value in the market again." The proposed changes require Securities and Exchange Commission approval, but Mr. Leibowitz hopes they can be completed by the end of September, the paper said. In return for giving up some of their privileges, specialist firms will gain more freedom to trade derivatives such as stock options and to bring in technology and trading experts from different parts of their firms, it said.
