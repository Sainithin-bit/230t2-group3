 OSAKA, Japan  (Reuters) - High commodity prices are threatening growth and increasing inflationary pressures, the Group of Eight nations will say after their meeting on Saturday, a source from the rich nations club said on Friday. 

 "For a long time the world economy enjoyed a combination of robust growth and low inflation, but it now faces headwinds," the G8 draft says, according to the source. "Elevated commodity prices, especially of oil and food, pose a serious challenge to stable growth worldwide...(and) may increase global inflationary pressures." The G8 will also express concerns about the sharp rise in the price of oil, the source said.
