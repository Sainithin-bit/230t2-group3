 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Investors suing Yahoo Inc's ( YHOO.O ) board renewed calls on Friday for a swift trial in the case, saying a new advertising deal with Google ( GOOG.O ) is the company's latest effort to coerce shareholders not to side with billionaire Carl Icahn in his proxy battle. 

 Yahoo "has found another way to coerce the stockholder vote, creating another reason why it is imperative that a trial be held in advance of the annual meeting scheduled for August 1," wrote lawyers for two Michigan pension funds that are leading the litigation. "We respectfully request that our motion to set a trial date be heard as promptly as the court's schedule permits," the lawyers wrote in a letter to Delaware Chancery Court Judge William Chandler III.
