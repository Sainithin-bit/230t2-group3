 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan faces pressure from inside and outside his Democratic Party to resign or call a snap election to try to break a parliamentary deadlock blocking the enactment of a workable 2011/12 budget. 

 Below are key facts about possible candidates to replace Kan, who took office last June and is Japan's fifth premier since 2006. SEIJI MAEHARA Currently foreign minister, Maehara, 48, is a defense policy expert who favors tight ties with Japan's close ally, the United States. He has expressed concern about China's military buildup but also sees the need for good relations with Beijing. "I want to make this year a year to push further for forward-looking Japan-China ties," he told Reuters in a January interview. "At the same time, it is important to say things firmly on issues of our concern." Although known more for his views on diplomacy and defense than the economy, Maehara has advocated streamlining public works projects. He studied at the Matsushita Institute of Government and Management, a school to train political leaders that emphasizes policy expertise. Many of its graduates embrace free markets and conservative security policies. In a stint as transport minister, he took a hands-on approach to the government's push to sell infrastructure projects abroad. Maehara ended a brief term as the Democrats' leader in 2006 after backing what turned out to be unproved allegations against an executive in the then ruling party. His hobbies include taking pictures of steam trains. KAZUHIRO HARAGUCHI A former internal affairs minister, Haraguchi, 51, is close to party powerbroker Ichiro Ozawa, who has been charged over suspected misreporting by his political funds body. Haraguchi has criticized Kan's call for tax reforms, including a sales tax rise to fund bulging social security costs and curb public debt. In a recent magazine article, he threatened to create a "DPJ-A" group that would put priority on an economic growth strategy and take the DPJ back to its roots, including sticking to costly campaign promises to put more money in consumers' hands to help engineer growth. He has set up a new political group calling for more regional autonomy and hinted at tie-ups with charismatic local mayors and governors. Haraguchi got his start in politics as a local assembly member from the then-ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and left the LDP after Ozawa bolted the party in 1993. First elected to parliament's lower house in 1996, Haraguchi also studied at the same political leadership school as Maehara. A familiar figure on TV talk shows who tweets and blogs, he lacks clout within the DPJ. BANRI KAIEDA Currently trade minister, Kaieda, 62, has stressed the need to open Japan through free trade accords such as the Transpacific Partnership (TPP), a U.S.-led Asia-Pacific free trade initiative. He has cautioned against a hasty rise in the sales tax due to possible adverse effects on the economy and called on the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to start discussing lifting a self-imposed ceiling on its government bond holdings, suggesting he wants more action from the central bank. Kaieda backed powerbroker Ozawa's failed bid in the party's leadership race last September but has kept mum on the split in the party over Ozawa's suspected funding scandal. Kaieda previously served as economics minister but was replaced by Kaoru Yosano, whom Kan handpicked to pursue social security and tax reforms, in a January cabinet reshuffle. He famously commented that the switch was "irrational" because Kaieda and Yosano had fought for the same constituency in Tokyo. Kaieda worked as a lawmaker's secretary and a commentator on economics and tax issues before entering politics. His first name comes from the Japanese translation for the Great Wall of China and his hobbies include reading Chinese poetry. YOSHIHIKO NODA Noda, 53, currently serves as finance minister and has strongly backed Kan's push for fiscal and tax reforms, including a future sales tax hike. As finance minister, Noda last September stepped into the foreign exchange market for the first time in six and half years to stem rapid yen gains and keep them from hurting exports. Noda has stuck to the finance ministry's lines on fiscal, tax and currency policies and proved to be popular among bureaucrats -- something that might not go down so well with voters after years of hearing the DPJ and other critics blame bureaucrats for Japan's policy problems. Like many other mainstream ruling party lawmakers and cabinet ministers, Noda has shrugged off calls for a rigid inflation target to combat deflation while welcoming the BOJ's comprehensive easing aimed at beating persistent price declines. Noda also attended the Matsushita Institute of Government and Management. Unlike many politicians, Noda does not come from a privileged background and is the son of a member of Japan's Self-Defense Forces, the country's military. He started in regional politics in 1987 and joined the Democratic Party about a decade ago, earning a reputation as an orator. A fan of combat sports, he is a keen judo practitioner. KATSUYA OKADA Okada, 57, the secretary-general of the ruling party and the son of a supermarket magnate, is another former leader of the ruling Democratic Party and has served as foreign minister. Known for his clean, serious image as well as a stubborn streak, Okada has been leading efforts to review the DPJ's 2009 campaign platform and hinted key pledges such as toll-free highways and child allowances should be changed. Okada has said in the past that he wanted to discuss fiscal reform, including an increase in the 5 percent sales tax. A former trade ministry official, he has pushed the DPJ to punish Ozawa over the funding scandal and advocates a ban on corporate political donations. He also has a strong interest in environmental policies and crafted the Democrats' pledge for a 25 percent cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 from 1990 levels. His hobbies include collecting frog knicknacks -- the Japanese word for 'frog' is a homonym of the word for 'change'. SHINJI TARUTOKO Tarukoto, 51, ran against Kan in a party leadership race last June but lost by a wide margin despite being backed by allies of party powerbroker Ichiro Ozawa. Tarutoko later backed Ozawa in a party leadership vote in September, which Kan won again. Tarutoko, who has served as the party's chief of parliamentary affairs, has not taken a clear stance on economic policies, including whether to raise the 5 percent sales tax. He heads a group of 30 lawmakers in the party. KOICHIRO GEMBA Gemba, 46, who currently doubles as the party's policy chief and National Strategy Minister, has spearheaded efforts to review pledges in the party's 2009 campaign platform, which critics say were too ambitious considering Japan's huge public debt. An advocate of deregulation, Gemba has also supported debate to raise the 5 percent sales tax, saying he wants to pass a law to enable a tax hike by the end of the next fiscal year in March 2012.
