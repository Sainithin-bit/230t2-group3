 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Monday in volatile trading as expectations that increased production from Saudi Arabia can offset supply disruptions in the region allowed investors to pause after Libya's turmoil sent prices to 2-1/2-year peaks last week. 

 Some of the lightest trading volume of the year indicated investor weariness, but also helped make for choppy trading and wide trading ranges. Foreign powers accelerated efforts to help oust Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi as rebels fought government forces trying to take back strategic coastal cities. Protests spread to oil producer Oman but had not yet affected oil output from Gulf Arab sultanate. "The Saudis are supposedly producing more but on the supportive side there is still the uncertainty about how much the unrest in Africa and Middle East will spread and how long Libya's oil will be shut off," said Chris Dillman, analyst at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut Brent crude futures for April fell 34 cents to settle at $111.80 a barrel, well off its $114.50 intraday peak. But Brent still finished 10.68 percent higher for the month, its biggest percentage rise since May 2009 when prices jumped 29 percent. Brent's premium to its U.S. counterpart remained nearly $15 a barrel, but has narrowed from last week's record spread of $16.91. Brent's price rise has been stronger because Europe is more vulnerable to supply disruptions from Libya and the region. U.S. crude fell 91 cents to settle at $96.97 a barrel, slipping after reaching a high of $99.96 intraday. U.S. crude posted a 5 percent monthly gain, biggest since December 2010. "A failed rally at the $100 area appeared to reduce buying interest as the market enters a wait-and-see mode as far as fresh Libyan developments are concerned," said Jim Ritterbusch, president at Ritterbusch & Associates in Galena, Illinois. Total U.S. crude trading volume was above 512,400 lots, 45 percent below the 30-day average of 929,140 lots, according to Reuters data. Brent's volume just topped 396,300 lots, 22 percent below the 30-day average. Saudi Aramco CEO Khalid al-Falih told reporters the demand caused by violent unrest in Libya had been met. Saudi Arabia is pumping around 9 million barrels per day and has spare capacity of around 3.5 million bpd, a senior Saudi source told Reuters, confirming a figure given by an industry source last week. Crude oil shipments from Libya were at a virtual standstill because of reduced output and bad weather, according to shipping sources. Also tempering the view that the Libya supply disruption would be short-lived was a Bank of America Merrill Lynch warning output could be reduced for months. Thorbjrn Bak Jensen of Global Risk Management said the situation in the Middle East and North Africa remained volatile and the outlook for prices unclear. "If Saudi Arabia starts to rumble, $120 per barrel is cheap. If not, and (Muammar) Gaddafi leaves and peace and quiet spread in the involved countries, $120 is expensive," he said. Democracy activists in Saudi Arabia say the government is monitoring social media to limit any protests. Activists have set up Facebook pages calling for protests on March 11 and 20. Nearby Yemen's opposition rejected an offer of a unity government, saying it would stand with protesters demanding an end to the 32-year rule of President Ali Abdullah Saleh. The region's uncertainty limited any price pressure from concerns about reports showing pending home sales fell in January and a consumer spending rise that was the smallest in seven months. Geopolitics also trumped any effect from the weaker dollar, usually supportive to dollar-denominated commodities by reducing the cost to consumers using other currencies and lower the value of greenbacks paid to producers.
