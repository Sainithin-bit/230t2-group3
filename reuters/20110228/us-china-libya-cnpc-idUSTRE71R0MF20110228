 BEIJING  (Reuters) - State-owned China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) said it has halted production operations and sealed equipment in Libya and evacuated all of its 391 Chinese employees out of the country. 

 The top Chinese oil and gas firm said in a company newspaper its last group of employees had arrived safely in Tunisia on Sunday and would fly back to China. The China Petroleum Daily report did not disclose CNPC's businesses in Libya, other than saying many projects were in the Libyan desert. Some of its project camps and operating sites had been attacked, CNPC said last week. CNPC is parent of PetroChina. China's Ministry of Commerce has said 75 Chinese companies have operations in Libya and China had evacuated almost 16,000 of its citizens by Saturday.
