 CHARLOTTE, North Carolina  (Reuters) - Former Wells Fargo & Co ( WFC.N ) Chief Financial Officer Howard Atkins received zero shares under the bank's long-term stock bonus program for 2011, the company disclosed on Monday. 

 The fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets disclosed in a securities filing that Atkins, who stepped down from his post on February 6, did not receive any shares, despite delaying his official retirement until August 6. In all, five senior executives, including Chief Executive John Stumpf, received share awards. The shares will vest three years after being awarded, in the first quarter of 2014, and the ultimate award will be adjusted depending on Wells Fargo's performance over the next three years. Stumpf received 382,410 shares under the program. David Hoyt, head of wholesale banking, received 207,139 shares. Mark Omen, head of consumer banking, and David Carroll, head of wealth management, both received 159,338 shares and community banking chief Carrie Tolstedt received 175,271 shares.
