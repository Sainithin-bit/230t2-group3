 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Fannie Mae FNM.P, the largest provider of money for U.S. home mortgages, on Tuesday said its federal regulator suspended a mandate to set aside money for a housing trust fund. 

 The Federal Housing Finance Agency on November 13 said it was suspending the requirement to allocate funds equal to 4.2 basis points for each dollar of new mortgage purchases for a "Housing Trust Fund" and "Capital Magnet Fund," Fannie Mae said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. The FHFA forced Fannie Mae into conservatorship in September amid concern mortgage losses would erode the capital the company needs to support the U.S. housing market. Fannie Mae last week said it was losing money so quickly that it may have to tap the Treasury for cash to avoid shutting down. Fannie Mae should not allocate money to the funds "until further notice," it said, citing the FHFA notice. (Reporting by  Al Yoon ; Editing by Dan Grebler)
