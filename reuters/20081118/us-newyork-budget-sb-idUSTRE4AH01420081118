 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wall Street's bonus outlook has worsened in light of the fact Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) top executives are foregoing bonuses this year and Citigroup ( C.N ) is laying off 52,000 workers, New York Gov. David Paterson said on Monday. 

 New York gets about one-fifth of its tax revenues from the financial industry, but such collections are plunging since Wall Street firms have been forced to write down hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of faulty investments. "This means that our assumption is probably correct, that the projection for bonuses will be down even from where they are now," Paterson told reporters on a conference call, adding that capital gains tax collections will also be hit. Fiscal monitors have projected bonuses could be slashed by half, to a total of $16 billion. The latest chapter in Wall Street history further imperils the Democratic governor's effort to persuade state legislators to slice $2 billion from the current fiscal year's $121 billion budget at an emergency session on Tuesday. Paterson said a refusal so far by the lawmakers to negotiate means they might delay action until December, forcing the state to grapple all at once with a $15 billion deficit spread over 16 months. "This does not bode well," Paterson said. New York starts its new fiscal years on April 1, and its multiyear deficit now totals $47 billion. The lame duck Republican-led senate on Monday stuck with its demand that the governor submit detailed bills they say they need to assess whether to approve his cuts. Schools and Medicaid, the state-federal health plan for the poor and disabled, would bear 65 percent of the reductions; the state work force would have to forego its 3 percent pay increase next year and pay more for health care. Senate Majority Leader Dean Skelos, said in a statement: "I again ask the governor to give us bills that we can discuss in conference later today with an eye toward putting the bills up for a vote by the Senate at the special session tomorrow." But Paterson said his staff had already met fifty times with their legislative counterparts to explain the bills, adding he put them out in draft form in the hopes of persuading legislators to put forward their own recommendations. Unless the state legislature approves the reductions, Paterson said he could only slice a couple of hundred million dollars from the budget on his own. The governor, who only took office in mid-March, has already ordered trimmed spending several times.
