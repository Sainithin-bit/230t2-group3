 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The White House on Tuesday said it opposed providing automakers more funds than the $25 billion in government loans already appropriated to help the ailing industry. 

 White House spokeswoman Dana Perino reiterated opposition to using the $700 billion financial rescue package for automakers, calling it "unnecessary and unreasonable." She said the $25 billion already appropriated through a Department of Energy loan program should be what is used to help the automakers. "We are not in favor of even an additional $25 billion in taxpayer money on top of that," Perino said. She said the administration hoped a bipartisan agreement could be reached with Congress on allowing automakers to use the Energy Department loans, intended for fuel efficiency, to address the current financial problems facing the car makers.
