 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) could announce plans to sell a 20 percent stake in Mazda Motor Corp ( 7261.T ) as early as Tuesday, the Nikkei business daily reported. 

 Ford, which has a controlling 33.4 percent stake in the Japanese automaker, is scrambling to raise cash to turn around its business, battered by slumping sales in the United States and other markets. (Reporting by  Chang-Ran Kim )
