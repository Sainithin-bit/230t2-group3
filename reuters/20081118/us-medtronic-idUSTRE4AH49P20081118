 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Medtronic Inc ( MDT.N ) said on Tuesday quarterly net profit fell 14 percent, hurt by charges for a legal settlement and inventory writeoffs. 

 Medtronic said fiscal second-quarter net earnings were $571 million, or 51 cents a share, compared with $666 million, or 58 cents a share, a year ago. Excluding charges, the Minneapolis-based medical device maker earned 67 cents per share. The charges included $229 million in litigation fees paid to Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ.N ) to settle stent patent litigation and $40 million for a writedown of inventory in the stent product line, the company said. Second-quarter revenue rose 14 percent to $3.57 billion. Analysts on average were expecting Medtronic to earn 71 cents a share before special items, on revenue of $3.69 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.
