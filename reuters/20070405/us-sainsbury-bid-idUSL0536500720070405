 LONDON  (Reuters) - Kohlberg Kravis Roberts has dropped out of the group bidding for J. Sainsbury ( SBRY.L ), it confirmed on Thursday, as the British retailer declined to comment on reports it had received a buyout offer. 

 The Times newspaper's Web site reported Sainsbury, Britain's third largest supermarket group, was reviewing a takeover bid by the remaining trio of private equity firms led by CVC Capital CVC.UL of around 9.5 billion pounds ($19 billion). Sainsbury had no plans to issue a statement on Thursday, a person familiar with the matter said. Sainsbury's spokeswoman and the private equity consortium declined to comment. KKR KKR.UL, which has launched a 10 billion pounds bid for Britain's largest pharmacy group Alliance Boots AB.L, said in an emailed statement it had quit the bidding group after "careful consideration". Earlier in the day, sources familiar with the situation said KKR had cooled on a deal because of price concerns and possible competition complications related to its bid for Alliance Boots, but an offer from the consortium remained high. The board, which includes a member of the Sainsbury family, was divided on whether to recommend any offer, another person familiar with the matter said. The group, now comprising CVC Capital CVC.UL, Blackstone Group BG.UL and Texas Pacific Group TPG.UL, has until April 13 to say whether it plans to bid for Sainsbury under a deadline set by the UK takeover watchdog. Market expectations are of a bid of 550 pence to 600 pence per share and an offer of around 9.5 billion pounds would be at the lower end of forecasts. Sainsbury shares closed at 561.5 pence on Thursday having gained nearly 30 percent in value since the consortium was forced by Britain's Takeover Panel nine weeks ago to reveal it was considering a bid. "If it comes in at 550 pence, I wouldn't expect it to be a knockout offer. Given the share price rise, it's a bit lower than people were looking for, Seymour Pierce's Andrew Wade said. The reported offer also comes without the approval of the company's pension trustees, who are seeking assurances the consortium will fund a contribution deficit of as much as 1 billion pounds. The bidders' failure to gain the trustees' approval before tabling a bid was exceptional so that any deal was now moving into "unchartered territory", a spokesman said. Merrill Lynch analyst Andrew Fowler said on Wednesday a 550 pence a share offer could even be a stretch for private equity given the pension contributions. With Sainsbury's having posted last week exceptionally strong 5.9 percent like-for-like sales in the first three months of this year even that offer may not be high enough to convince shareholders, analysts have said.
