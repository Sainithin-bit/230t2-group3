 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Constellation Brands Inc. ( STZ.N ) posted a quarterly profit that topped estimates on Thursday, as a lower-than-expected tax rate offset a decline in operating margin due to higher material costs and pricing pressure in Britain's wine market. 

 The owner of Robert Mondavi, Vendage and Ravenswood wines, whose shares rose 3 percent in morning trading, said its comparable tax rate for the fourth quarter was 32.9 percent versus 24.8 percent a year ago. Analysts said that rate was lower than expected and added 2 to 3 cents to earnings. Fairport, New York-based Constellation has been struggling with its business in Britain, as an oversupply of grapes from Australia has flooded the market with inexpensive wine, hurting prices. To lessen the blow, the company has said it is focusing on other so-called "New World" wine markets, including the United States and New Zealand. Strong sales in those regions helped Constellation post net income of $70.2 million, or 29 cents per share, in the fiscal fourth quarter that ended February 28, up 20.5 percent from $58.2 million, or 24 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Excluding costs related to realigning its business and stepping up inventory, the company -- which also imports Corona Extra, St. Pauli Girl and Tsingtao beers -- earned 35 cents per share. That beat the Wall Street average estimate, according to Reuters Estimates, by a penny. Constellation said its operating margin was 14.1 percent in the latest quarter, compared with 15.5 percent a year ago. Net sales rose to $1.14 billion from $1.05 billion a year before. For fiscal 2008, which will end next February, Constellation affirmed its outlook for earnings per share in the range of $1.30 to $1.40 excluding items, which would be down from the $1.68 per share it earned in fiscal 2007. Constellation shares were up 58 cents at $21.40 on the New York Stock Exchange. A year ago, the shares closed at $25.88.
