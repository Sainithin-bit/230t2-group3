 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - New Century Financial Corp. ( NEWC.PK ), the largest U.S. subprime lender now under bankruptcy protection, was authorized on Thursday to obtain up to $150 million of financing to keep operating under Chapter 11. 

 The order by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Kevin Carey allows New Century to draw on funds it lined up from CIT Group Inc. ( CIT.N ) and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc's ( RBS.L ) Greenwich Capital Financial Products Inc. unit prior to its April 2 bankruptcy filing. "Terms of the (financing) are fair, just, and reasonable under the circumstances (and) reflect the debtors' exercise of their prudent business judgment consistent with their fiduciary duties," the Wilmington, Delaware-based judge wrote. Carey set an April 19 deadline for parties to object to the so-called debtor-in-possession financing. A final hearing to authorize the financing is set for April 24. New Century had been the largest independent U.S. provider of home loans to people with poor credit histories before seeking court protection from its own creditors. The Irvine, California-based company collapsed amid rising delinquencies and defaults, a federal criminal investigation into its accounting and trading in its securities, and orders by or agreements with at least 17 U.S. states to stop lending. New Century has said it agreed to sell its loan servicing unit to hedge fund Carrington Capital Management LLC for $139 million, and some loans to Greenwich Capital for $50 million. Other bidders are eligible to offer higher amounts. Both sales require court approval. New Century stopped making loans last month, and also wants to sell its loan origination platform. It has said a quick sale is necessary so the business's value isn't wiped out. Earlier this week, Carey authorized New Century to pay its employees and some amounts it owes creditors. The company on Monday fired 3,200 employees, or 54 percent of its work force. New Century shares rose 17 cents to $1.17 in afternoon trading on the Pink Sheets.
