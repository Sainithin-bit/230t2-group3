 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Southeastern Asset Management on Thursday became the third major shareholder of Japanese brokerage Nikko Cordial Corp. 8603.T to say it placed a sell order for a large block of Nikko stock at 1,900 yen per share, above Citigroup's ( C.N ) 1,700 per share takeover price. 

 "Southeastern has decided that it will accept 1,900 yen per share for the 6.6 percent of Nikko Cordial owned by its clients, and accordingly has placed a limit order to sell 64,424,500 shares at 1,900 yen per share on the Tokyo Stock Exchange," said Southeastern in a statement. The move puts pressure on Citigroup to raise its roughly $14 billion bid for the Japanese brokerage. Chicago-based Harris Associates and Bermuda-based Orbis Investment Management have already offered their roughly 5 percent stakes in Nikko at 1,900 yen each, 200 yen above Citigroup's tender offer for Japan's third-biggest securities firm.
