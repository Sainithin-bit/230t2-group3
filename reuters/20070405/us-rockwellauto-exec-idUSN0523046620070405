 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Diversified manufacturer Rockwell Automation Inc. ( ROK.N ) said on Thursday James Gelly resigned as chief financial officer, sending the company's shares down more than 5 percent. 

 J.P. Morgan analyst Stephen Tusa downgraded Rockwell to "neutral" from "overweight." "A lack of detail is troubling," Tusa wrote in a note to clients. "There is little information about the specific reasons for the change, and raises questions about the strategic direction of the company." The maker of factory-automation systems said Gelly, 47, planned to "pursue new challenges and opportunities." A spokesman declined to provide further details and said Gelly would not be available for interviews. Rockwell shares were down $3.43 at $58.10 on the New York Stock Exchange. They've been as high as $79.40 and as low as $53.49 over the past 12 months. The slide left them down 4.9 percent for the year, compared with a 1.4 percent rise in the Standard & Poor's capital goods index. .GSPIC LESS TEMPTING TAKEOVER? In recent years, Rockwell has sold off a few segments of its operations, as part of an effort to focus on higher-tech, higher-profit-margin products. Most recently, in January, Rockwell sold its Dodge mechanical and Reliance Electric units, which accounted for about one-fifth of its revenue, to Baldor Electric Co. BEZ.N in a $1.8 billion deal. "Investors thought this thing was being primed for a sale to a larger, multi-industrial company," said Chris Kotowicz, a stock analyst at A.G. Edwards, who rates Rockwell a "buy." "There was a perception that he was taking steps to make the company a better company, but also more attractive to an acquirer," Kotowicz said. "Him leaving is an indication that perhaps the rest of the management team and perhaps the board didn't see that as their first choice of where they wanted to take the company." A Rockwell spokesman declined to comment on that idea. Rockwell said Theodore Crandall, 52, currently senior vice president and head of the Control Products & Solutions segment, will take on the CFO duties on an interim basis. Rockwell said it will conduct an internal and external search for a permanent successor to Gelly, who the company said will continue to advise Rockwell for the next few months. Gelly joined Rockwell in 2004, after stints at Honeywell International Inc. ( HON.N ) and General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) Crandall is a 28-year veteran of Rockwell.
