 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Some of the payments at the center of Conrad Black's criminal fraud trial were reported to U.S. government regulators in a timely fashion and not hidden as prosecutors have suggested, jurors were told on Thursday. 

 Under cross examination, Fred Creasey, a former comptroller at Black's Canadian holding company Hollinger Inc., was shown a document bearing his name by defense lawyer Patrick Tuite. Creasey had testified on Wednesday that some of the money paid to Black and his associates from newspaper property sales in 2000 did not show up in regulatory filings that Hollinger's U.S. subsidiary, Chicago-based Hollinger International, had made until May 2001. But the document Creasey was given on Thursday had been filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in December 2000, two weeks after a major deal involving the sale of some of Black's newspapers. Creasey said he could not remember the document. Tuite suggested that Creasey was trying to "mislead the jury", but he was cut off after objections from prosecutors. U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald's office is running the prosecution. The courtroom exchange on Thursday, in the early stages of a trial that may go on for months, was an attempt to discredit the prosecution's claims that money flowed to Black and his three co-defendants in a shadowy fashion that skirted routine and legitimate business practices. While focusing on business practices and who knew about what, prosecutors have yet to start trying to prove their allegations that the payments Black and the others received were illegal. The defendants claim they were not. Prosecutors contend that Black and the three co-defendants diverted about $60 million from Hollinger International by sending payments from non-compete agreements to entities more closely controlled by Black such as Hollinger Inc. Black could then siphon those funds for a lavish lifestyle, prosecutors said. These so-called non-compete payments were part of the proceeds from the sale of dozens of newspapers Black and his associates sold as they disassembled what had been one of the world's largest media empires. The payments were made by those purchasing the papers to guarantee that Hollinger International would not reenter a market where it had sold an asset. The company, now called Sun-Times Media Group Inc., once owned hundreds of Canadian and U.S. newspapers, as well as the Daily Telegraph of London and the Jerusalem Post. The case grew out of institutional shareholders' objections to the way the non-compete payments were handled. Black, Jack Boultbee, who was chief financial officer at Hollinger Inc., Peter Atkinson, once an attorney at Hollinger Inc., and Mark Kipnis, once an attorney at Hollinger International, are charged with defrauding shareholders of Hollinger International. The 62-year-old Canadian-born Black is charged with fraud, racketeering, money laundering and obstruction of justice that could result in a maximum prison sentence of 101 years, plus millions in fines and $92 million in possible forfeitures. A member of Britain's House of Lords since 2001, Black is also accused of misusing his company's money to finance a lavish lifestyle that included extravagant parties attended by celebrities at his homes in London, New York and Florida.
