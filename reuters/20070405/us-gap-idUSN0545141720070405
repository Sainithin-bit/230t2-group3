 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Gap Inc. ( GPS.N ) said on Thursday that it would introduce a limited-edition collection of women's clothing made exclusively for its stores by design labels Doo.Ri, Rodarte and Thakoon. 

 The Gap Design Editions collection, which features clothing inspired by a classic Gap white shirt, will be available starting April 17. Gap is trying to pull itself out of a sales slump, hurt by what it has acknowledged were fashions lacking creativity and marketing that has confused, rather than inspired, shoppers. Other retailers, like J.C. Penney Co. Inc. ( JCP.N ), Kohl's Corp. ( KSS.N ) and Target ( TGT.N ), have boosted sales by partnering with designers to sell exclusive lines of merchandise in their stores. Gap said the new collection included a belted shirtdress by Doo.Ri for $88, a sleeveless blouse adorned with bows around the neckline by Rodarte for $78, and a belted shirtdress with puffed sleeves for $88 by Thakoon. Gap shares were down 8 cents at $17.66 in morning New York Stock Exchange trading.
