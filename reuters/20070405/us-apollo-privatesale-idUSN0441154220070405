 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Private equity firm Apollo Management LP is exploring raising money by selling a stake in the company through a private placement or by making a public offering, a source familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. 

 A private placement would allow the firm to avoid the public scrutiny of an initial public offering and still generate a cash infusion. New York-based Apollo was working with investment banks Goldman Sachs Group ( GS.N ) and JP Morgan ( JPM.N ) and was very early in the process, the source said. Apollo could also decide to do nothing. An Apollo spokesman did not return a message seeking comment. Private equity firms recently have sought to access public capital through public offerings. The cash infusion generated by a public offering allows buyout firms to attract and retain talent, use equity for acquisitions, raise money more quickly, and ensure the firm remains viable after its founders leave. Blackstone Group last month filed for a $4 billion IPO of around 10 percent of the firm. Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. and Apollo both launched public funds in Europe last year. Apollo's private placement plans would entail selling a 10 percent stake for $1.5 billion, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday, citing people close to the situation. Apollo was founded by former Drexel Burnham Lambert banker Leon Black. Its most recent fund raised $10 billion to invest. Apollo deals include the purchase of retailer Linens N' Things and real estate firm Realogy Corp. ( H.N ) (Additional reporting by Ed Leefeldt)
