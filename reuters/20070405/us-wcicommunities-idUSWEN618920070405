 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - WCI Communities Inc. WCI.N said on Thursday its board determined a $22-per-share buyout offer from billionaire Carl Icahn is not best for the company or its shareholders and recommended stockholders not tender shares. 

 "We reached this conclusion after carefully considering the tender offer price and terms, as well as the advice of our financial and legal advisors," Don Ackerman, chairman of WCI, which builds upscale houses and condominiums chiefly in Florida.
