 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Drugstore chains CVS/Caremark Corp. ( CVS.N ) and Rite Aid Corp. ( RAD.N ) said on Thursday that sales at stores open at least a year rose in March, but their results trailed growth by rival Walgreen Co. ( WAG.N ), posted earlier this week. 

 Shares of all three companies advanced in afternoon trading, with Rite Aid showing the largest gain, up 1 percent. CVS posted a 7 percent rise in March sales at stores open at least a year. Total revenue for the five weeks ended March 31 jumped 23.3 percent to $4.8 billion, excluding results from pharmacy benefits manager Caremark Rx Inc., which CVS bought in late March. At Rite Aid, same-store sales rose 3.3 percent, and total drugstore sales for the four weeks ended March 31 were up 3.8 percent to $1.36 billion. Credit Suisse analyst Edward Kelly said Rite Aid's same-store sales were in line with his expectations and the average Wall Street estimate. Kelly, who has an "outperform" rating on Rite Aid, said the company's "core business is slowly recovering," and the pending acquisition of the Brooks and Eckerd stores "adds a large intermediate-term catalyst." Goldman Sachs analyst John Heinbockel kept his "sell" rating on Rite Aid, but said he expects the company to post strong fourth-quarter results on April 12, driven by the rising use of generic drugs and better expense control. Heinbockel said sales at CVS, which he rated as "buy," were solid and in line with his expectations. On Tuesday, Walgreen said March same-store sales rose 8 percent, and total March sales increased 12.8 percent to $4.61 billion. NO BIG EASTER IMPACT Walgreen and CVS said March sales were not significantly affected by an earlier Easter. The holiday falls on April 8 this year, compared with April 16 last year. Drugstores sell Easter-related items such as candy, baskets and gift cards. CVS said it usually gets the majority of Easter-related revenue in the last few days leading up to the holiday, so investors will have to wait for April data to see those results. CVS reported sales for the 13 weeks ended March 31 jumped 23.3 percent to $12.3 billion, while same-store sales for the 13-week period rose 7.5 percent. Pharmacy sales represented the largest percentage of sales at CVS, with 69.8 percent of total March revenue coming from its pharmacies. At Walgreen, pharmacy sales accounted for 66.6 percent of total March sales, and at Rite Aid prescription revenue accounted for 65.4 percent of sales. CVS has about 6,200 drugstores, making it the largest chain in terms of number of stores. Walgreen operated 5,675 drugstores as of March 31, while Rite Aid had 3,334 stores. All three companies are opening new stores or remodeling old ones, and adding services such as in-store clinics to attract shoppers. CVS has been the most acquisitive, buying the Osco and Sav-on chains from Albertsons last year, and Caremark last month. Walgreen has bought smaller businesses. Rite Aid, based in Camp Hill, Pennsylvania, plans to buy the U.S. Eckerd and Brooks chains from Canada's Jean Coutu Group (PJC) Inc. ( PJCa.TO ). Shares of CVS were up 15 cents at $34.74 in afternoon New York Stock Exchange trading, while Rite Aid rose 7 cents to $6.00, and Walgreen shares gained 25 cents to $46.25.
