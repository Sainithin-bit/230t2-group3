 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) Chief Executive Alan Mulally said on Wednesday the automaker must do "whatever it takes" to make its cost structure competitive and called discussions with the United Auto Workers this summer an important part of the equation. 

 The former Boeing Co.( BA.N ) executive, who joined the automaker last September, also said that problems in the subprime lending market are "a concern" and Ford was keeping a close watch on the U.S. economy. "We have to do whatever it takes to get a cost structure that is competitive and that includes all the elements of it -- 17 to 18 percent of it is wages and benefits," Mulally told a Morgan Stanley conference in New York in the afternoon. "We have to look at that. It is going to be a very important conversation we have with the UAW this year." Ford, which posted a $12.7 billion loss last year, is in the midst of a restructuring that calls for the closing over a dozen facilities and cutting about 45,000 jobs in North America. In a breakfast speech earlier, kicking off the New York International Auto Show, Mulally said the restructuring of the automaker's North American operations is "generally going pretty well," but the significant job cuts have caused "tremendous upheaval." Mulally told reporters at the auto show that the slowing housing market was a concern for the automaker. The automaker's restructuring plan hinges on the economy holding up. "The biggest thing we've got to keep watching is the economy, because the housing starts, the construction industry, all these things influence purchasing decisions," Mulally said. "It's a little bit softer now, and we see that in our sales a little bit; but the economy kind of looks pretty good through the rest of this year," he added. Ford's North American president, Mark Fields, said Ford could take the biggest hit among automakers from weakness in the housing and credit markets because of its dominance in pickup trucks, the staple vehicle of the construction industry. On Tuesday, Ford reported a 15 percent drop in monthly sales of its market-leading F-Series pickup trucks, in a generally poor month for U.S. automakers. Problems in the subprime lending segment have not directly affected Ford so far, Fields said, but could if they spread to the broader market. UAW TALKS Ford has seen its U.S. market share steadily decline over the years but costs remain high. Since Mulally took over from Ford family scion Bill Ford Jr., he has moved to streamline management, appointed a global product chief and raised $23.5 billion in cash through liens, bond offerings and credit lines. The upcoming UAW talks are another opportunity for Ford to cut fixed costs. Ford's current labor agreement with the UAW expires in September. "We're cautiously optimistic." Mulally said, referring to the contract talks. Fields said the automaker will address the controversial "Jobs Bank" program -- which ensures nearly full pay and benefits to laid off workers -- with the UAW during the upcoming negotiation with the union for a new labor contract. Fields' comments follow UAW President Ron Gettelfinger's assertion last week that he does not consider Jobs Bank a major issue during the negotiations.
