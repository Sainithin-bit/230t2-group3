 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ), which is pushing its suppliers to embrace environmental practices, is now expanding a program that it said will get its employees to improve their health and wellness, and the health of the environment. 

 The world's largest retailer said on Thursday that it is expanding "Personal Sustainability Projects," or PSPs, to its 1.3 million U.S. workers after piloting the program last year. It said the projects are used by employees to develop individual goals like making healthier food choices, volunteering or using environmentally friendly products at home. Wal-Mart, which is under attack by critics for its pay and health care policies, has been touting its environmental initiatives. It has vowed to cut energy usage and reduce waste at its stores, and it has challenged employees, suppliers and customers to remove nonrenewable energy from their lives. The retailer has asked its electronics suppliers to start evaluating the environmental impact of their products, and it said it will use the assessment to determine which merchandise to sell in Wal-Mart stores. While the initiatives may help the environment, they also allow Wal-Mart to cut its costs. For instance, it has asked its suppliers to cut the amount of packaging used in products sold through Wal-Mart by 5 percent by 2013. The move is expected to save the retailer $3.4 billion over five years. Wal-Mart shares rose 26 cents to $48.31 in afternoon trading.
