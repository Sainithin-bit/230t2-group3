 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Medical testing equipment company Beckman Coulter Inc. BEC.N on Thursday affirmed its commitment to complete its acquisition of Biosite Inc. BSTE.O for $1.55 billion. 

 In response to a competing offer from Inverness Medical Innovations Inc. IMA.A for Biosite, Beckman Coulter President and Chief Executive Officer Scott Garrett said his company could complete the deal in 30 days. He also called Beckman's offer "superior to the unsolicited, highly speculative and conditional letter that Biosite has received from Inverness Medical."
