 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc. ( QCOM.O ) said it filed an arbitration demand against Nokia ( NOK.N ) ( NOK1V.HE ) to resolve a dispute over their license agreement. 

 Qualcomm sought Nokia's continued use of its patents in CDMA cellular handsets after April 9 to be treated as an election by Nokia to extend its license under their existing agreement, the company said in a statement. Nokia's claim that it has been paying cumulative royalties of no more than 3 percent on WCDMA products sold through 2007 is "intentionally deceptive and misleading", the company said, adding Nokia has been paying a royalty on WCDMA handsets in excess of 3 percent to Qualcomm alone.
