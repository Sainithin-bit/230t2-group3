 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Nine years ago, when Daimler-Benz AG bought Chrysler Corp. for nearly $40 billion, billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian cleaned up, on paper tripling his investment in the U.S. carmaker. 

 As the German automaker now tries to undo that ill-starred purchase by selling the money-losing U.S. unit, the reclusive billionaire looks like he'll do quite nicely again. That's no surprise to long-time Kerkorian watchers. Deal-making has been a recurring theme in the 89-year-old's life. On Thursday, Kerkorian's Tracinda Corp. investment arm said it offered to buy all of DaimlerChrysler AG for $4.5 billion, just $500 million less than he netted in 1998, when the Daimler-Chysler deal was inked. "It adds more intrigue to the whole process," Dave Cole, chairman of the Center for Automotive Research, said of Kerkorian's offer. "The numbers are very difficult to evaluate because you have to look at the asset values, the liabilities. So the actual amount of cash paid is going to depend on a lot of things." Kerkorian's 1998 windfall in Chrysler proved short-lived as the combined company stumbled in integrating two vastly different corporate cultures. The shares plummeted as did the value of Kerkorian's remaining stake in the company. In 2000, he filed a $1 billion lawsuit against Daimler contesting the acquisition. Two years ago, a federal judge in Delaware ruled against Kerkorian, saying Daimler-Benz had not fraudulently misrepresented the takeover as a merger of equals. To no one's surprise, Kerkorian appealed the ruling. "He's a guy who just won't let go," said Peter DeLorenzo, the publisher of Autoextremist.com, an industry blog. UP FROM FRESNO The son of an Armenian immigrant, Kerkorian grew up the youngest of four children in Fresno, California. After dropping out of school in the eighth grade, he boxed for a while under the moniker "Rifle Right," before joining the Royal Air Force to fly supply planes from Canada to Britain during World War II. After the war, his love of flying and risks took him to Las Vegas, where the gambling industry was in its infancy. Kerkorian bought surplus war planes to fly gamblers from Los Angeles to Las Vegas. He pocketed his first fortune when the business, called Trans International Airlines, went public in 1965. In 1968, he sold it to Transamerica Corp. for more than $100 million in cash and stock. The first investments to earn him broad recognition came in 1970, when he built the 2,000-room International Hotel in Las Vegas, the largest in the city, and also became the largest investor in Hollywood movie studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Kerkorian expanded his entertainment empire in 1981, when he bought another faded Hollywood studio, United Artists, and merged it with MGM. He sold MGM to Ted Turner in 1986, but months later bought it back, except for 3,300 titles from its classic film library. He sold MGM again in 1990, but bought it for a third time in 1996, when French bank Credit Lyonnais put the studio on the auction block. Kerkorian's latest offer for Chrysler isn't his first. In the 1990s, shortly after the company was bailed out by the U.S. government, Kerkorian began amassing shares in the struggling automaker, ultimately controlling 100 million shares. In 1996, he launched a hostile $22.8 billion bid for control. In the end, Kerkorian failed to win control but got a seat on the board and forced the company to increase share buybacks and sell off nonauto assets. In 2005, Kerkorian appeared to make a similar run at General Motors Corp., with Tracinda amassing nearly 10 percent of GM shares. In the end, Kerkorian sold the stake after failing to get the company to agree to partner with either Renault or Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. "The guy is relentless," said DeLorenzo. "His age is just a number. He just loves being in the game and when he isn't in it, he gets itchy."
