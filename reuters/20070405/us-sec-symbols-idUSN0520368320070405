 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Competing proposals on allocating stock symbols have been received by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, with the New York Stock Exchange wanting to guard shorter stock identifiers from being used by Nasdaq-listed companies. 

 The SEC said on Thursday it will work to resolve conflicts between the proposals over the issue of symbols with three or fewer characters. The NYSE and other exchanges are pushing to limit the use of one-, two- and three-character symbols to those listing markets that have traditionally used those symbols. Nasdaq and other self-regulatory organizations are trying to permit any listing market to use one-, two-, three-, four- or five-character symbols, allowing companies to move their securities onto the Nasdaq while retaining their ticker symbols. The SEC said it plans to publish the proposals for comment and "will resolve the conflicts over the allocation of stock symbols as fairly and expeditiously as possible." An SEC spokesman did not have an estimate of how quickly the issue would be decided. The investor protection agency asked the exchanges in February 2005 to work together to develop a national market system plan for reserving, selecting and allocating securities symbols. "Securities symbols are an important part of a listed company's identity and developing a formal process to reserve, select and allocate symbols among listing markets and their companies will help promote a fair and orderly national market system and prevent investor confusion," SEC Market Regulation Director Eric Sirri said in a statement. A new plan would replace the informal understanding among the listing markets under which the NYSE and the other exchanges, including the American Stock Exchange and regional exchanges, use symbols with three or less characters, and Nasdaq uses four- and five-character symbols. A few months after the SEC made the request to formalize the symbol allocation system in 2005, Nasdaq announced its intention to begin listing companies with three or less symbols. Late last month Delta Financial Corp. (DFC) DFC.O became the first company with a three-character symbol to trade on the Nasdaq, which was allowed after a proposal to list that specific company was approved. On March 29 Nasdaq moved a step further with a proposal to the SEC that would explicitly permit the display of three-character symbols on its exchange. The SEC will consider the proposal after the public comment period ends on April 25.
