 PHILADELPHIA  (Reuters) - Harrah's Entertainment Inc. HET.N, the world's largest casino operator, said on Thursday that a majority of its shareholders approved the planned $17.1 billion takeover by two private equity firms. 

 Based upon a preliminary tally of shares voted, 66 percent of total shares outstanding supported the deal. Harrah's expects the deal to be completed by the end of the year, pending regulatory approvals. In December, Texas Pacific Group TPG.UL and Apollo Management L.P. agreed to buy Harrah's for $90 per share.
