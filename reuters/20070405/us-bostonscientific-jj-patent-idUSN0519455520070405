 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A U.S. federal court has ruled that a drug-coated stent sold by Johnson and Johnson( JNJ.N ) does not infringe a patent held by Boston Scientific Corp. ( BSX.N ). 

 In a ruling handed down on Wednesday, U.S. District Court Judge Sue Robinson granted a motion by J&J unit Cordis for summary judgment, saying, "based on the evidence of record, no reasonable juror could find for Boston Scientific on the issue of infringement." The patent relates to a method for treating or preventing heart disease through a particular kind of medicinal therapy -- in this case the drugs used on the stents. J&J's Cypher and Boston Scientific's Taxus are currently the only drug coated heart stents available on the U.S. market. Stents are tiny mesh tubes used to prop open arteries that have been cleared of plaque that had been clogging the vessel. The drug coating helps prevent the formation of scar tissue that can reclog the arteries. Boston Scientific had previously prevailed in lower courts in patent disputes that involved the stent itself and the polymer used to bind the medicine to the stent. "We are considering our options," Boston Scientific spokesman Paul Donovan said of the ruling by the Delaware court. "We remain focused on the two cases we won in the lower courts and we expect those rulings to stand," Donovan said. He added that this ruling has no bearing on either of the other two cases. Johnson & Johnson said it was pleased with Judge Robinson's decision. "It affirms our view that we are not utilizing a competitor's intellectual property, but our own," said Cordis spokesman Christopher Allman. Boston Scientific shares were up 12 cents to $14.97 on the New York Stock Exchange, down slightly from a high of $15.00 earlier in the day. J&J shares were up 29 cents to $61.58, also on the NYSE.
