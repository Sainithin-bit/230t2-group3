 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Darden Restaurants Inc. ( DRI.N ) said on Thursday that same-store sales at its Olive Garden restaurants rose 3 percent to 4 percent in March, while same-store sales at Red Lobster fell about 3 percent. 

 Olive Garden restaurants open at least 16 months -- a key industry sales-tracking measure -- benefited from pricing and higher guest traffic during the five-week March fiscal month, the Orlando, Florida-based company said. Sales at Darden's Red Lobster chain fell as higher menu prices failed to offset a 5 percent drop in guest traffic. The start of Lent in fiscal March this year, compared to fiscal February last year, and the resulting shift in the start of Lobsterfest, also contributed to lower sales at Red Lobster, the company said. In March, the restaurant operator said it expects same-store sales to rise between 2 percent and 3 percent for Red Lobster and Oliver Garden in 2007. Darden also operates the Bahama Breeze, Smokey Bones and Seasons 52 restaurant brands.
