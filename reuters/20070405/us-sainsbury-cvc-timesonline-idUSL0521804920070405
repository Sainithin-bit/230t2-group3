 LONDON  (Reuters) - A group of private equity firms led by CVC Capital has tabled an indicative offer of about 9.5 billion pounds ($18.75 billion) for UK supermarket chain J. Sainsbury ( SBRY.L ), the online edition of the Times newspaper reported on Thursday. 

 The Web site headline "CVC tables preliminary offer for J. Sainsbury" initially linked to a story saying that the bid was expected to be filed today with the headline "J. Sainsbury bid closer as KKR pulls out". It later updated the story to say the private equity group had approached Sainsbury with an indicative offer, but did not say how much it had offered for each Sainsbury share. A spokesman for the consortium declined to comment. Earlier in the day, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. KKR.UL had withdrawn from the group, leaving CVC, Blackstone Group and Texas Pacific Group. Sainsbury shares swung to a gain in the afternoon after falling as much as 1.8 percent earlier. They stood 0.3 percent higher at 562 1/2 pence at 1431 GMT.
