 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo's office, which is probing the $85 billion student loan industry, said on Wednesday it is investigating grants of stock from a student lender to financial aid officers at three major U.S. universities. 

 A Cuomo spokesman said the office sent a subpoena to New York's Columbia University and sent document-retention letters to the University of Southern California and the University of Texas. The office wants information on school officials who own stock in companies included on colleges' preferred lender lists. Officials from the three universities each owned at least 1,500 shares of Education Lending Group, as disclosed in a stock offering prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in September 2003. Student Loan Xpress, a unit of the company, is a "preferred lender" at these schools. David Charlow, the associate dean of student affairs at Columbia, owned 7,500 shares of Education Lending stock and 2,500 stock warrants ahead of the offering, according to the filing. He sold his shares for a gain of more than $100,000. Charlow also was quoted endorsing Student Loan Xpress on its Web site. Columbia, which is cooperating with the probe, was not immediately available for comment. Education Lending's prospectus also identified student aid officials Catherine Thomas, of USC, and Lawrence Burt, of the University of Texas, as each owning 1,500 shares. The Associated Press first reported the stock ownership news earlier on Wednesday. Officials at CIT Group Inc., a commercial finance company that acquired Education Loan Group in 2005, were not immediately available. USC and University of Texas officials also could not be reached for comment. The three school officials also could not be reached for comment. Cuomo for the past two months has drawn attention to potential for abuses in student lending, where loan providers offer payments and perks to college officials and then appear on the school's preferred lender list. Getting on the list is crucial, since nine out of 10 students choose their provider from the list, Cuomo said. The Education Lending prospectus provides fuel for Cuomo's investigation by naming college officials as shareholders. The company even tells investors that Student Loan Xpress markets itself "to the financial aid offices of schools in order to be included on that school's preferred lender list." Previously, Cuomo's investigators found many colleges entered into kickback arrangements with lenders, while some colleges have "exclusive" agreements with loan companies.
