 PHILADELPHIA  (Reuters) - Biosite Inc. BSTE.O, which has agreed to be acquired by Beckman Coulter Inc. BEC.N, said on Thursday that Inverness Medical Innovations Inc. IMA.A was planning an unsolicited offer to buy Biosite for $90 per share. 

 Inverness already owns 4.9 percent of Biosite, which makes tests that help in the diagnosis of heart conditions and other diseases. At $90 per share, Inverness's potential offer to buy the remaining shares of Biosite it does not already own would be valued at about $1.56 billion. Beckman said last month it would acquire Biosite for $85 per share, or about $1.55 billion, to expand its presence in the market for the diagnosis and assessment of heart failure. Biosite stock surged 9 percent, or $7.61, to $91.91 in noon trading on Nasdaq. Beckman's shares lost $1.44, or 2.2 percent, on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares of Inverness hit a low of $38, but recovered to trade at $41.70, down $3.11, or 6.9 percent, on the American Stock Exchange. Inverness said it must review Biosite's proprietary financial records before a formal offer could be submitted. Biosite said its board is evaluating Inverness' letter, but declined to comment further. "This is a surprising and extremely aggressive move by (Inverness), especially give the size of the deal," Stifel Nicolaus analyst Gregory Simpson said in a research report. Inverness has a market capitalization of about $2 billion, or about half the size of Beckman's $4.2 billion market capitalization. "We find the move interesting but are uncertain of the strategy, to say the least," said Simpson. Stifel Nicolaus cut its investment rating on Inverness to "hold" from "buy." Beckman reiterated its commitment to acquire Biosite and said it could complete the deal in 30 days. Beckman said its proposal was "superior to the unsolicited, highly speculative and conditional letter that Biosite has received from Inverness Medical." The unsolicited offer by Inverness "raises questions as to the success of (Inverness's) ongoing cardiology R&D (research and development)," Simpson said. "Does the proposed Biosite acquisition strengthen this strategy significantly or does it suggest that Inverness's internal efforts have been disappointing and unsuccessful?" The Beckman-Biosite deal grew out of a relationship the two companies had over the past four years in the area of B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP), a test that aids in the diagnosis and severity-assessment of heart problems. The threat of a competing bid may force Beckman to sweeten its deal, but it may be restrained it how much it could offer, said one arbitrageur who declined to be named. Beckman's stock has dropped about 5 percent since March 23, the last trading day before it announced its deal with Biosite. Shares of Biosite have surged 66 percent over that same time period.
