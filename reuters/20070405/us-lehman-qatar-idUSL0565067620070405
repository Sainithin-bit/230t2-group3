 LONDON  (Reuters) - U.S. bank Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. LEH.N has been granted a license to operate in Qatar, where it plans to expand its Middle East business after it moved into Dubai last year. 

 The bank said on Thursday it had established a strategic relationship with the Qatar Investment Authority to seek ways to invest globally. Lehman also said it continues to seek other opportunities in the region, which is attracting rapid banking interest to handle more than $2 trillion of investable assets. It plans to offer a full range of investment banking and capital markets services in Qatar after being granted the license by the Qatar Financial Centre Regulatory Authority to operate as an authorized firm in the Qatar Financial Centre.
