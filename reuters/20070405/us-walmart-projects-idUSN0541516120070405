 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) on Thursday said it was expanding its employee-established effort on "Personal Sustainability Projects." 

 PSPs are worker-driven efforts through which employees develop individual goals to improve their health and the environment. The projects include workers making healthier food choices, volunteering in their communities and using environmentally friendly products in their homes. Staff will also work together at a store level on sustainability measures designed to improve the local community.
