 MILAN  (Reuters) - AT&T says it is open to Italian partners in Telecom Italia as it and America Movil aim to buy a controlling interest in Italy's biggest telecoms operator, where investors are at loggerheads over the sacking of its chairman. 

 The head of corporate development for AT&T ( T.N ) -- which is in talks along with Mexico's America Movil ( AMXL.MX ) about buying Telecom Italia's ( TLIT.MI ) holding company -- told a newspaper he could only comment further when proposals arrived. "We are absolutely ready to take into consideration the interests of Italian industrial and financial partners," Rick Moore said in an interview published in Thursday's edition of leading newspaper Corriere della Sera. The U.S. and Mexican companies are in exclusive talks with Pirelli ( PECI.MI ) about buying 66 percent of Olimpia -- a holding company that owns 18 percent of Telecom Italia. Shares in Telecom Italia were up 0.5 percent at 2.42 euros by 1448 GMT, while Pirelli gained 1 percent in a flat market. The discussions, which could give control of the 45 billion euro group for about 4.5 billion euros ($6.01 billion), have turned up the volume in a debate over protectionism and fired speculation that European or domestic alternatives could emerge. ALTERNATIVES? Italian bank Mediobanca ( MDBI.MI ), insurer Generali ( GASI.MI ) and bank giant Intesa Sanpaolo ( ISP.MI ) are working on alternatives for Olimpia, sources have told Reuters, pressured by the centre-left government of Prime Minister Romano Prodi. "We think it's possible to work with other financial institutions to seek solutions that respect all the interests involved," Intesa Sanpaolo Chief Executive Officer Corrado Passera said in a statement on Thursday. His bank, the second-largest in Italy, and Mediobanca had offered to buy Telecom Italia shares held by Olimpia for 2.7 euros a share but their offer was refused by Pirelli, Italian daily La Repubblica reported earlier this week. The offer from AT&T and America Movil values Olimpia's stake in the telecoms group at about 2.96 euros a share when accounting for the dividend Telecom Italia will pay this month. Prodi's row with Telecom Italia over asset sales last year led to the resignation of Marco Tronchetti Provera as chairman, a post that carries more weight than chief executive. Tronchetti, who still heads Pirelli and is ultimate owner of Telecom, has held talks with a number of possible investors as he seeks to sell the Telecom holding, which he counts at a loss. This week, newspapers reported Spain's Telefonica ( TEF.MC ) and France Telecom FTE.PA were preparing bids, but both declined to comment. SocGen analysts said in a note that if Telefonica were approached by Italian banks, government or Telecom Italia management and got necessary guarantees, "we believe the company would probably reconsider its position". For the Americans and Mexicans, there is no wish to pursue a deal if the government is hostile, a source close to the operation said. Opposition to the U.S.-Mexican talks has come from coalition politicians and other investors in Telecom Italia -- including Mediobanca and Generali -- who slammed on Wednesday the sacking of Chairman Guido Rossi and called for an emergency meeting of Pirelli's key investors.
