 PARIS  (Reuters) - France appeared to have removed a threat to one of Europe's largest energy deals on Sunday after the boards of Suez and Gaz de France voted on a politically charged merger delayed by disputes over strategy and control. 

 Gaz de France's board backed a new deal, a source close to the board said. There was no word on the outcome of an earlier board meeting at Suez, but sources agreed it was highly unlikely that GDF GAZ.PA would have voted on a deal if Suez had walked away. A press release was scheduled for 0600 GMT (2 a.m. EDT) on Monday. The merger of companies with a combined value of 90 billion euros ($123 billion) was pushed forward 18 months ago by a previous conservative government to prevent a foreign takeover of Suez LYOE.PA, the company that built the Suez Canal. But a host of problems caused by public doubts over the privatization of GDF, regulatory conditions, paralysis during recent French elections and, finally, a messy jigsaw puzzle over financial valuations almost scuppered the huge deal. Salvaging the union would forge an energy giant in Europe's top three behind French state power firm EDF and Germany's E.ON. A source close to the talks said Suez had backed down over control of its historic water and waste assets following the intervention of French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who laid down terms for the merger in a speech last week. The government wants Suez to sell these assets, valued at 18 billion to 20 billion euros, to slim down the company and ensure a politically acceptable "merger of equals" with the smaller GDF. After putting up a robust defense against selling, Chairman Gerard Mestrallet agreed to spin off some 65 to 66 percent of the business to let the main deal go ahead, the source said. In turn, that would help negotiators meet government conditions that the state, which owns 80 percent of GDF, should maintain a blocking minority of 34 percent in the merged entity. A union source said Credit Agricole bank and state-owned companies Areva and CDC, which between them own 8.4 percent of Suez, would buy further into the environment business, allowing Suez to claim that it and its partners retained 48 percent of it. "As long as the boards give their approval, all the elements of an agreement are on the table now," Finance Minister Christine Lagarde said on Europe 1 radio earlier on Sunday. Carrying out the deal could take months or a year, however. "The board voted in favor of a text which goes in this direction. But we have a complex process ahead of us. It could take a year," the source close to the GDF board said. SARKOZY STEPS IN The deal follows a tense week that saw the French president step directly into the negotiations amid a war of words between the heads of Suez and GDF and signs of brinkmanship on all sides. Unions and opposition Socialists oppose the privatization of GDF and suspect it will lead to gas tariff rises. On the other hand, some investors fear state interference in the new group. "The state will truly have a power to give direction to the new company," said Claude Gueant, Sarkozy's chief of staff. The new group will be called Gaz de France-Suez, he said. A CGT union official said after meeting Sarkozy the state would have a stake of about 40 percent in the new GDF-Suez. French Socialist leader Francois Hollande accused Sarkozy of "giving orders like a prince" to complete the deal, reversing a pledge he had made as finance minister to keep GDF public. Suez's market capitalization has increased faster than that of GDF since former conservative Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin first announced their intention to merge on an equal basis to prevent Suez falling into the hands of Italy's Enel. The mechanics of the final deal were not immediately clear, but analysts say spinning off 66 percent of environment assets could solve the valuation problem, assuming Suez shareholders are compensated with shares in the new vehicle. Under that scenario, Suez shareholders could receive 0.8-0.85 of a Gaz de France share instead of the original 1 share in addition to the spin-off proceeds, but any significant changes to the terms may need fresh regulatory approval. However, a source close to the talks said the parity would not change. "It is a very balanced deal organized around GDF's core business. We are sticking with what was planned, the same parity and the same organization. It is a merger of equals. "The idea is that the new entity would keep 34 to 35 percent of the environment activity and would keep control of it. The rest would be listed on the stock exchange." Both companies declined to comment. Suez shares closed at 41.74 euros on Friday, valuing the company at 54.1 billion euros. GDF, worth 36.2 billion, closed at 36.8 euros a share.
