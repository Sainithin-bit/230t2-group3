 HARARE  (Reuters) - Zimbabwe's government has taken over U.S food giant H.J Heinz's HNZ.N 49 percent stake in the African nation's leading cooking oil maker for $6.8 million and handed its management to a firm with ties to the state. 

 Agro-processing company Cotton Company of Zimbabwe (Cottco), which was a state enterprise until its privatization in 1997, announced it had bought H.J Heinz's stake in Olivine Industries in a deal facilitated by a government-owned investment company. This is the first major deal involving the takeover of a firm following President Robert Mugabe's vow to give Zimbabweans greater control over foreign-owned assets. Mugabe's government has accused some businesses of halting production in a plot to undermine the inflation-ravaged economy. Zimbabwe's parliament is considering enacting a law that seeks to transfer majority ownership of businesses --including foreign-owned banks and mines -- to locals.
