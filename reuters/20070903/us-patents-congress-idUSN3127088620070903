 (Reuters) - The Congress is likely to take up changes to patent law this month. The patent system's last broad overhaul was in 1952. 

 The bills headed to floor debate in the Senate and U.S. House of Representatives are nearly identical. The high-tech industry generally supports the legislation while drug companies oppose it. Following are key features of the legislation: DAMAGES The biggest battle will likely be over calculating damages in patent suits. The proposals raise the level of proof required to prove that a patent was willfully infringed, which can mean damages are tripled. The bills would also drop the practice of using the value of the entire product in calculating damages. The damages would instead be based on the value of the item whose patent was infringed. PATENT CHALLENGES The measures would strengthen the post-grant review process by allowing the public to bring proof to the federal patent board that a patent should not have been granted. FORUM SHOPPING The changes aim to crack down on "forum shopping," essentially filing patent suits in courts believed to be sympathetic to people who claim infringement. Suits would have to be filed in a jurisdiction where one of the parties resides or where the corporation is incorporated or has its principal place of business. FIRST APPLICATION In a fundamental philosophical change, patents would be granted to the first person to file a patent application, not to the person who proved that he or she first invented the item. This would bring the United States in line with patent practices in Europe. PRIOR ART Currently, an inventor does not have to research "prior art," essentially any public information on whether a patent would be valid. But inventors are obliged to share anything they already know about prior art in applying for a patent. Failure to do so can mean losing the patent. It is often invoked in lawsuits. Under the House bill, patent applicants would be vulnerable to attack for failure to disclose prior art only in the case of misrepresentation or if they knew the invention should not be patented. The Senate proposal is weaker.
