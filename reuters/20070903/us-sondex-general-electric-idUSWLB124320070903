 LONDON  (Reuters) - U.S. conglomerate General Electric ( GE.N ) has agreed to buy British oilfield services firm Sondex SDX.L for 288.7 million pounds ($583.1 million) in cash, the two firms said on Monday. 

 General Electric, whose interests span technology, media and financial services, will pay 460 pence a share for Sondex, which designs, makes and markets electro-mechanical based equipment for oilfield service companies. That is 35.5 percent above Sondex's closing share price on August 30, the day before it announced takeover talks.
