 LONDON  (Reuters) - British oilfield services firm Sondex Plc SDX.L will urge U.S. conglomerate General Electric ( GE.N ) to buy more firms in the sector after its own takeover is completed, Finance Director Chris Wilks said. 

 GE said on Monday it had agreed to buy Sondex in a 288.7 million pounds ($583.1 million) cash deal, and Wilks told Reuters he and Chief Executive Martin Perry would be staying with the company and encouraging future growth. "GE buys 100 companies a year -- its pretty acquisitive -- and we want to convince them to spend more money in our space," he said in a telephone interview. GE is buying the firm through its Optimization and Control business -- an oil technology specialist -- which is based in the US and generates turnover of about $1.1 billion. A spokesman for GE in Europe said this was the division's first venture outside the United States, but would not comment on whether it would be the first of many. Optimization and Control is part of the GE Energy arm, which contributed around $12 billion of the $163.4 billion sales generated by the overall group last year.
