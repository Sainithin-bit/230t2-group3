 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - The following is a summary of recent comments by Fed policy-makers: 

 * Denotes 2007 voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets U.S. monetary policy. FEDERAL OPEN MARKET COMMITTEE, AUG 7: "Economic growth was moderate during the first half of the year. Financial markets have been volatile in recent weeks, credit conditions have become tighter for some households and businesses, and the housing correction is ongoing. Nevertheless, the economy seems likely to continue to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters, supported by solid growth in employment and incomes and a robust global economy. "Readings on core inflation have improved modestly in recent months. However, a sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated. Moreover, the high level of resource utilization has the potential to sustain those pressures. "Although the downside risks to growth have increased somewhat, the Committee's predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected. Future policy adjustments will depend on the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information." * FED GOVERNOR RANDALL KROSZNER, AUG. 2: On impact of subprime mortgage distress: "I think at this stage the economic fundamentals are really unchanged from where Chairman Bernanke talked about them here in this committee about two weeks ago and so we have not seen an effect on the broader real economy. But we are looking very, very carefully at that." FED GOVERNOR NOMINEE ELIZABETH DUKE, AUG. 2: "Unfortunately, I do have some experience with troubled debt, and that specific issue will probably get a lot worse before it gets better. "I don't think that the subprime issues have impacted the overall economy, the day-to-day functioning of the economy." * ST. LOUIS FED PRESIDENT WILLIAM POOLE, JULY 31: "The Fed doesn't know, and market participants do not know either, the full implications of last week's stock market declines and increases in the risk spreads." "Most of these upsets stabilize on their own, but some do not. I'm not saying that the Fed should ignore what happened last week -- we need to understand what is happening." "The market understands, I believe, that the Fed will act in due time if and when evidence accumulates that action would be appropriate." * NEW YORK FED PRESIDENT TIMOTHY GEITHNER, JULY 25: "Overall, the U.S. economy continues to display remarkable resilience and flexibility, despite a range of adverse shocks." * ST. LOUIS FED PRESIDENT WILLIAM POOLE, JULY 24: U.S. economic data and anecdotal information shows inflation moderating "a bit" but has yet to be convincing, he said. "All of that is hopeful, but not yet decisive." PHILADELPHIA FED PRESIDENT CHARLES PLOSSER, JULY 24: "If I started to see some of the spillovers occur in some of the prime mortgages, I'd get more nervous. "Things like serious, substantial falls in consumer spending or employment begin to tail off. And we don't see that much." * CHICAGO FED PRESIDENT MICHAEL MOSKOW, JULY 19: "My assessment is that the risk of inflation remaining too high is greater than the risk of growth falling too low. "If we have some concern that the current reduction in core PCE (personal consumption expenditures) may be transitory, we have to look at this for an extended period of time to see where we are and where we thing we're going." * FED CHAIRMAN BEN BERNANKE, JULY 19: "The credit losses associated with subprime have come to light and they are fairly significant." "Some estimates are in order of between $50 and $100 billion of losses associated with subprime credit problems." * FED CHAIRMAN BEN BERNANKE, JULY 18: "Although the most recent readings on core inflation have been favorable, month-to-month movements in inflation are subject to considerable noise, and some of the recent improvement could also be the result of transitory influences." "With the level of resource utilization relatively high and with a sustained moderation in inflation pressures yet to be convincingly demonstrated, the FOMC has consistently stated that upside risks to inflation are its predominant policy concern." "Declines in residential construction will likely continue to weigh on economic growth over coming quarters, although the magnitude of the drag on growth should diminish over time." "Overall, the U.S. economy appears likely to expand at a moderate pace over the second half of 2007, with growth then strengthening a bit in 2008 to a rate close to the economy's underlying trend." * KANSAS CITY FED PRESIDENT THOMAS HOENIG, JULY 17: "As you look at the economy and you weigh these risks right now, I can make a case for ... both an easing or tightening as you move forward." "We've seen some favorable numbers on core CPI (consumer price index), back towards 2 percent. It's not there yet but it's getting very close." (To access stories on Fed policy click on)
