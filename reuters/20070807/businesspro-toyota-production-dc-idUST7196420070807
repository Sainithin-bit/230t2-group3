 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ) has told its 
parts makers that it is planning global output of over 10 
million vehicles in 2008, up more than 6 percent from its plans 
this year, the Nikkei business daily reported on Tuesday. 

  In addition to the United States, the automaker expects 
sales growth in emerging markets including China, as demand is 
likely to increase for its fuel-efficient and environmentally 
friendly cars, the daily said.  Toyota's sales drive has helped its group, which includes 
Daihatsu Motor Co. ( 7262.T ) and truck maker Hino Motors Ltd. 
( 7205.T ), end General Motors Corp.'s ( GM.N ) 75-year reign as 
the world's biggest automaker in 2006.  It outsold the struggling Detroit behemoth by 128,000 units 
last year, according to Automotive News Data Center.  Japan's top automaker aims to make 10.4 million vehicles in 
2008 on a group basis, up from a planned 9.74 million units 
this year, the paper said.  These figures, given to parts suppliers last week, differ 
from what Toyota has disclosed as its official global 
production targets, which do not include cars made for sale 
under other companies' brands, the Nikkei said.  A Toyota spokesman declined to comment on the report.  Shares of Toyota rose 1 percent to 7,250 yen, outperforming 
a 0.4 percent gain in Tokyo's transport sector subindex
