 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Bayer BAYG.DE reported a 30 percent jump in quarterly operating profit on Tuesday as strong sales of cancer drugs and contraceptives helped offset weakness at its plastics unit which was crimped by high oil prices. 

 The German drugs and chemicals group reported earnings before interest, taxes and special items rose to 1.19 billion euros ($1.7 billion) in the second quarter, compared with a 1.13 billion euro average forecast in a Reuters poll of 14 analysts. "I'm pleased with the results because they were largely in line. There was no major surprise," said Stephan Thomas, a fund manager at Frankfurt-Trust who is neutral on Bayer stock. Shares in Bayer rose 0.4 percent to 52.40 euros by 6:10 a.m. EDT, compared to the pan-European healthcare index's .SXDP 0.3 percent rise. Bayer, which invented Aspirin more than a century ago, boosted its healthcare business with its 17 billion euro acquisition of Schering last year. This is the fourth full quarter that Schering has contributed to Bayer's results. Bayer also confirmed it expected its core operating margin before special items to exceed 20 percent for the full year for the first time because of a strong healthcare unit. Second-quarter net profit rose 46 percent to 660 million euros on a 22 percent rise in sales to 8.22 billion euros. Sales of Bayer's top-selling multiple sclerosis drug, Betaseron, rose 2.8 percent pro forma in the second quarter because of currency effects, while sales of contraceptive drug Yasmin increased a pro forma 38 percent, Bayer said. Betaseron competes with rival drugs such as Merck KGaA's ( MRCG.DE ) Rebif and Biogen's ( BIIB.O ) Avonex. Sales of cancer drug Nexavar rose 161 percent to 60 million euros, while sales of Kogenate for bleeding rose 17.3 percent. In the first half, Bayer's healthcare division accounted for about 44 percent of group sales and nearly half of underlying operating profit. Analysts expect healthcare to be an important earnings driver, as new drugs such as Nexavar fuel growth. The stock has risen about 28 percent this year, outshining a 15 percent gain in the pan-European DJ chemicals sector .SX4P and a 5 percent dip in the healthcare index .SXDP. PLASTICS, CROPSCIENCE Citigroup analysts, who rate Bayer a buy, said they were confident of sustained progress in earnings per share growth and cash generation at Bayer. "We view (this) as the basis for continued outperformance," Andrew Benson said in a note to clients. At its material science unit, which focuses on chemicals and plastics and competes with BASF BASF.DE and Dow ( DOW.N ), operating profit before special items fell 14 percent as rising prices for feedstock hit its profit, despite more sales. Bayer was more positive about its agribusiness, which competes with Syngenta ( SYNN.VX ) and Monsanto ( MON.N ). The division posted a 14 percent rise in operating profit before special items thanks to higher sales of fungicides and seed treatment products and cost cuts. Like its rivals, Bayer's crop-protection business had a tough 2006, but investors are hoping a recovery in agricultural markets this year will boost revenues and profit. Bayer said it now expected sales at the unit to grow in the second half of the year. It had previously said full-year sales would grow slightly faster than the market. The full-year underlying EBITDA margin target for the division is now more than 22 percent, compared to the previous forecast of an improvement approaching 22 percent, it added. Swiss Syngenta also raised its full-year forecast as a strong U.S. corn planting season boosted first-half net profit. Compared with European chemicals and pharmaceuticals peers, Bayer is the fourth-best performing stock so far this year. Bayer's trades at about 12 times estimated 2008 earnings, compared with its chemicals peers at 14.3 times and drugmakers at 13.6 times, according to JP Morgan.
