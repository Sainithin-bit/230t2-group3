 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - German cement maker HeidelbergCement AG ( HEIG.DE ) won European Commission permission on Tuesday to buy Britain's Hanson Plc HNS.L to create the world's second-largest construction materials company. 

 "The Commission's examination of the proposed transaction showed that the horizontal overlaps between the activities of HeidelbergCement and Hanson are limited," the Commission said in a statement. The Commission's investigation showed that in all markets where the companies operated, "the combined firm would continue to face strong competitors with significant market shares". The cash offer of 8 billion pounds ($16.32 billion), or 1,100 pence per share, would be the biggest takeover in the sector -- creating a building materials company with a market value of $34 billion, leapfrogging Lafarge ( LAFP.PA ) and challenging top-ranked Saint Gobain ( SGOB.PA ). The deal highlights the growing attractiveness of Hanson, which produces aggregates such as crushed rock and gravel, as the sector consolidates and companies look to boost margins and market share in what is a highly fragmented industry. Heidelberg, majority controlled by German billionaire Adolf Merckle, founded its first cement plant in 1873 and focused on southern Germany until the end of the 1960s. A flurry of deals has given it a presence in more than 50 countries worldwide. Hanson started in 1964 and grew under the leadership of James Hanson and Gordon White into a multinational conglomerate ranging from cigarettes to batteries, toys and Jacuzzis. In 1996, the company demerged its businesses into four separate firms, including Imperial Tobacco and the building materials business which remained Hanson Plc.
