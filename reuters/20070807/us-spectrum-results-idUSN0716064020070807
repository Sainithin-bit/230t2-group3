 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Spectrum Brands Inc. SPC.N said on Tuesday it aims to sell "an attractive strategic asset" by the end of 2007 and has enough liquidity to operate normally for the foreseeable future even without such a sale, sending its shares up more than 19 percent. 

 The company, which grew through acquisitions, has been trying to shed some of its assets for some time and its debt and equity have been trading near lows. Spectrum also posted a wider-than-expected quarterly loss as drought conditions across parts of the United States pressured the home and garden business it has been trying to sell and sales of batteries were weak. Spectrum said it is still treating its home and garden unit as a business held for sale but it has not yet determined when that sale may occur. For now, it is focused on selling another asset it declined to name by the end of calendar year 2007 and will then look at selling the home and garden business. There has been a lot of interest in the company's assets including the one Spectrum decided to sell, Chief Executive Kent Hussey said on a conference call. He said that asset would go on the market after Labor Day, which is Sept 3. "The reality is that we have an unacceptable level of leverage and we have to take some dramatic action to deal with that," Hussey said. In July 2006, Spectrum said it hired Goldman Sachs to help it evaluate asset sales designed to sharpen its focus on growth businesses and reduce debt. The company, whose products range from Rayovac batteries to Tetra pet products, has yet to announce a major sale since it hired Goldman. Spectrum posted a loss of $7.4 million, or 15 cents per share, for its fiscal third quarter, ended July 1, compared with a profit of $2.5 million, or 5 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the loss was 16 cents per share. Analysts, on average, expected a loss of 12 cents per share. Sales rose 3.4 percent to $442 million, falling short of analysts' average forecast of $450.9 million. Battery and personal care sales rose 4 percent to $307 million as the positive impact of foreign currency translation and growth in Latin America partially offset weaker sales in North America. Sales in the home and garden division, which the company counts as a discontinued operation, fell 4.6 percent. Atlanta-based Spectrum expects further year over year improvement in EBITDA in the fourth quarter and beyond, driven by cost cuts, Hussey said. Hussey, who became CEO in late May, also said that the company should post "healthy profit growth" next year with a stable world economy. He said commodity costs appeared to be stabilizing, but at historically high levels. He said Spectrum continued to hedge its most important commodity materials, such as zinc and urea, to lock in costs for fiscal 2008. Shares of Spectrum were up 80 at $4.95 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. (See  here  for "Shop Talk" -- Reuters' retail and consumer blog) (Reporting by  Jessica Wohl )
