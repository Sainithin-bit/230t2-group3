 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) has cut its 2007 U.S. industrywide vehicle sales outlook to a range of 16.5 million to 16.8 million, from a prior 16.8 million, citing weak July sales and a U.S. housing sector correction. 

 Ford had said it would reassess its forecast in light of July sales results, and disclosed the updated forecast in its quarterly report filed on Tuesday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. U.S. auto sales have been slowing since spring and July sales were particularly weak across the board for automakers.
