 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Tenet Healthcare Corp. ( THC.N ),one of the biggest U.S. investor-owned hospital chains, on Tuesday missed Wall Street expectations and cut its 2007 forecast, blaming worse-than-expected declines in patient volume. 

 Admissions fell 2.2 percent, but the number of patients without insurance still rose 7.3 percent in the quarter, highlighting the rising burden of the 45 million uninsured Americans on some hospital systems. "It looks like volume trends are pretty consistent with the rest of the industry this quarter -- disappointing," Balaji Gandhi, a hospital analyst at Oppenheimer, said. Adding to hospital woes may be larger economic issues, such as the mortgage crunch and high gas prices, Gandhi said. That echoes comments from some hospital executives last week. Citing charges related to litigation and investigations, Tenet posted a second-quarter net loss of $30 million, or 6 cents per share, compared with a net loss of $398 million, or 85 cents per share, a year earlier. It reported a loss from continuing operations of 6 cents per share, falling short of analysts, who on average forecast a loss of 1 cent per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Tenet continues to be dogged by the aftermath of a series of scandals, capped by a $900 million settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice last year. Its troubles tattered its ties with doctors, leading many to flee its networks, taking their insured patients with them. The company, which owns about 55 hospitals, also cut its 2007 forecast for adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to a range of $675 million to $725 million, compared with a May forecast of $700 million to $800 million. Net operating revenue rose slightly to $2.23 billion, from $2.20 billion a year earlier. About 45 million people, or 15 percent of the U.S. population, lack health insurance, 5 million more than in 2000. (Reporting by Kim Dixon)
