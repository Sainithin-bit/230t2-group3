 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - MGIC Investment Corp ( MTG.N ), the largest independent mortgage insurer, said on Tuesday its management has made a preliminary assessment that it is not obligated to complete its acquisition of rival Radian Group Inc 

  ( RDN.N ). The all-stock deal was worth roughly $5.5 billion when announced in February, but is now worth about $2.7 billion because MGIC's shares have since lost almost half their value. If the Radian acquisition failed to close, it would be the latest casualty of a mortgage crisis and resulting credit squeeze that has rattled financial markets and put merger deals on hold. MGIC Investment said its board will not be asked to make a final decision on whether it is obligated to close the Radian deal until management has completed its analysis. MGIC Investment said its assessment was made in light of recent problems at C-BASS, a mortgage credit joint venture co-owned with Radian. MGIC Investment and Radian have said they could be forced to write down the entire value of investments valued at $516 million and $518 million, respectively, in C-BASS, whose full name is Credit-Based Asset Servicing and Securitization LLC. Radian said later Tuesday it does not believe the problems at C-BASS affect MGIC Investment's obligation to buy the company. Radian said it remains committed to the transaction, and looks forward to its completion as promptly as possible. MGIC Investment said it is requesting additional information from Radian and is reviewing other developments that may affect its obligation to close. BLACKSTONE C-BASS, which issues home loans and invests in those loans to less credit-worthy borrowers, said on August 3 it retained private equity firm Blackstone Group LP ( BX.N ) to help it obtain more capital. MGIC Investment said it does not expect its analysis of the Radian deal to be completed until the week of August 13, and it has advised the New York Insurance Department of its preliminary assessment. MGIC Investment has already seen housing market losses cut into its earnings. In the first quarter, net income for the Milwaukee-based insurer fell by 43 percent as it incurred losses of $181.8 million. At that time, it warned that more homeowners might default, increasing its losses. Radian shares ended Tuesday down 5.3 percent at $22, while MGIC rose 4.2 percent to $34.68, both on the New York Stock Exchange.
