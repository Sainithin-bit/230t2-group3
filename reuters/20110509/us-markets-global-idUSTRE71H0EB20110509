 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - New-found worries that Greece may be forced to restructure its debt brought the euro to around a three-week low on Monday, while U.S. stocks rose as resource shares gained alongside commodities after last week's rout. 

 Oil prices extended gains to settle more than 5 percent higher in New York on a bargain-hunting-fueled advance as the dollar pared gains against the euro in afternoon trading. The European Union said it was talking about lowering interest rates on the bailout loans extended to Greece and Ireland in order to prevent a restructuring, but comments by ratings agency Standard & Poor's on Monday that more radical measures would be needed fueled investors' risk aversion. S&P cut Greece's credit rating to B from BB-minus on Monday, citing an increased risk of a debt restructuring. It said that a principle reduction of 50 percent or more on Greek debt may be needed. Yields on Greek and Portuguese debt rose, with five-year Greek paper offering around 22 percent. The euro fell as low as $1.4254 on trading platform EBS, the lowest since April 19, breaking through technical support at its 50-day moving average of $1.4279. It later recovered slightly to trade at $1.4333, up 0.2 percent on the day. The euro volatility "confirms the whole market skittishness about the viability of the peripheral economies," said Boris Schlossberg, head of research at GFT Forex. "More draconian measures will be necessary to stabilize the situation with a broader solution as Ireland and Portugal will want more favorable terms if Greece gets them." "SLOW MOTION CAR CRASH" On Wall Street, the bounce back in commodities lifted energy and materials shares. The energy and materials sectors were the best performers on the S&P 500 as the Reuters/Jefferies commodities index .CRB jumped 2 percent. The iShares Silver Trust exchange-traded fund ( SLV.P ) surged 7.3 percent, and the S&P energy index .GSPE advanced 1.6 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  gained 45.94 points, or 0.36 percent, to 12,684.68. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  rose 6.09 points, or 0.45 percent, to 1,346.29. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  climbed 15.69 points, or 0.55 percent, to 2,843.25. European debt worries, however, lingered. "Europe continues to be a regular cloud on the market," dimming the market's bullish mood, said Christian Magoon, chief executive of Magoon Capital in Lisle, Illinois Citigroup Inc ( C.N ) ,which in recent months accounted for about 6 percent of total composite volume, fell 2.3 percent to $44.16 after the company's 1-for-10 reverse stock split and pressured the market. The S&P financial sector index .GSPF was off 0.2 percent. In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 stock index  .FTEU3  ended down 0.4 percent. Shares of banks, which are seen as exposed through Greek bond holdings, suffered. "Generally the (economic) growth is insufficient to finance the cost of the burden of the debt for Greece, Ireland and Portugal. If Greece restructures its debt, people will start to ask where next," said Andrea Williams, who manages 1.3 billion pounds in assets for Royal London Asset Management. Banks were among the heaviest losers on the back of concerns about potential losses for private bondholders in the event of debt restructuring, with the STOXX Europe 600 banking index .SX7P down 1.3 percent. The MSCI all-country world stock index .MIWD00000PUS was off 0.1 percent. While few market players think Greece is likely to drop out of the euro, the European Union is under pressure to renegotiate its financial bailouts of Ireland and Greece, with an Irish minister saying any concessions given to Athens should mean better terms for Dublin as well. "The Greek situation is like a slow motion car crash. The politicians know they have to dip into the pockets to find a solution to the problems facing Greece," said Jeremy Stretch head of currency strategy at CIBC World Markets in London. Brent crude futures spiked up $6.77 at $115.90 a barrel, following last week's 12.8 percent slump. U.S. crude oil futures settled up $5.37 at $102.55 a barrel. The rebound reclaimed about a third of last week's losses, with many traders having anticipated a bounce after a series of automated stop-loss sales hammered prices on Thursday. A jump in gasoline prices on concerns flooding could disrupt U.S. refiners also added support. "We went through a pretty hefty sell-off for all markets," said Tony Machacek, an oil trader at Bache Commodities. "It smacked of funds getting sell-stops triggered. Now that long liquidation has been done, everything seems to be stabilizing." Commodity currencies were supported by a rebound in oil prices, after a plunge in oil, silver and other commodities last week. The dollar index .DXY fell 0.3 percent, which also added appeal for commodities priced in U.S. dollars. The Australian dollar rose 0.7 percent to $1.077, extending gains on Friday after the Australian central bank said rate hikes would be needed in future to contain inflation.
