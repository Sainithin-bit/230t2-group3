 PARIS  (Reuters) - The growth outlook in major industrialized nations is diverging with activity improving in North America, China and Russia and moderating in most European countries, the OECD's leading indicator for March showed on Monday. 

 The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said its composite leading indicator for member countries rose to 103.2 points in March from 103.0 in February, well above a long-term average of 100. The indicator showed "regained momentum in economic activity" in China and Canada while the United States, Germany and Russia were also in the midst of above-trend expansion, the OECD said. The indicator for countries belonging to the Group of Seven wealthy countries -- excluding Japan -- rose to 103.6 in March from 103.4 in February. For the euro zone, the indicator eased to 103.1 from 103.2. The pace of expansion will be "stable, albeit slow" in France and Britain while Italy, Brazil and India were headed toward "slowdowns in economic activity relative to trend," the OECD said. No estimates were provided for Japan because of the exceptional circumstances facing the country after the country was hit by a devastating earthquake and tsunami in March.
