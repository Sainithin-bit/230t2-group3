 MELBOURNE  (Reuters) - BHP Billiton, the world's biggest miner, warned on Monday that an over-reaction to Japan's nuclear crisis would be bad for clean energy solutions globally. 

 "I don't think an over-reaction at this point is valuable for the world and for energy solutions," BHP Chairman Jacques Nasser said when asked if Japan's nuclear problems would hurt demand for uranium. Asked about partnerships with Chinese companies, Nasser also told reporters BHP remained open to joint ventures but only if they added value for the mining company.
