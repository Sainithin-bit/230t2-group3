 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Greece wants a reduction in the interest rate on the financial aid it receives from the International Monetary Fund and the EU, German daily Die Welt reported on Monday, citing sources involved in negotiations. 

 Greece is also seeking an easing of the savings measures it is required to make under its rescue plan, as these are proving too much of a burden to its economy, the paper added. Athens wants to reduce its new borrowing level to 3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) two years later than 2014, as is now planned, Die Welt reported. Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou on Saturday denied there was even unofficial discussion over Greece quitting the euro zone and asked that his troubled country be "left alone to finish its task".
