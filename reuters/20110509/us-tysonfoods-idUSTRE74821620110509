 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Tyson Foods Inc ( TSN.N ) posted quarterly profit slightly below expectations and shares of the largest U.S. meat processor fell more than 5 percent on concern that it would not do much better in the face of rising costs the rest of the year. 

 The company has raised prices on the beef, chicken and pork it sells and said it might need to raise chicken prices again as higher prices for feed grains, particularly corn, and fuel are being passed on. Corn prices are more than double a year ago at about $7 per bushel, pushed higher by rain delaying planting of this year's crop and by strong demand by exporters and ethanol producers. Sharply higher cattle prices this year, because of higher feed costs, reduced beef margins. Tyson raises its chickens and buys the cattle and hogs for its beef and pork plants. "We are going to probably creep higher," Michael Swanson, agricultural economist at Wells Fargo, said of beef and pork prices. The cattle Tyson slaughtered in the second quarter did not have the most expensive corn in it. Higher-priced beef is still to come, said Swanson. For the quarter ended April 2, Springdale, Arkansas-based Tyson earned $159 million, or 42 cents per share, on a par with last year's results. Analysts on average forecast 43 cents a share. In that quarter, Tyson raised wholesale beef prices nearly 20 percent, chicken nearly 4 percent, and pork 18 percent. EARNINGS FLAT WITH YEAR AGO The higher meat prices held Tyson's second-quarter results at last year's level, and offset higher feed costs. For the year, the company maintained its estimate that it will spend $500 million more for feed than a year earlier. Shares of Tyson company dropped about 5 percent Monday, pressured by a reluctance to slow chicken production in the face of lower prices and concerns that profit in the second half of the fiscal year will be unchanged to worse than the first half. "I think the problem is they are implying no cuts are coming on the chicken and that makes it difficult to envision how long they can maintain these results," said Heather Jones, analyst with BB&T Global Markets. However, Jones said Tyson chicken may stabilize or improve going into the summer when sales seasonally should improve. COMPANY RAISES REVENUE VIEW TO $32 BILLION ON PRICING The company raised its full-year sales outlook to $32 billion, compared to the previous forecast of $31 billion that was expected by Wall Street. Operating margin fell to 2.8 percent in the quarter from 4.5 percent a year earlier. Revenue was up 15.7 percent to $8 billion, beating the $7.54 billion expected by Wall Street. Chicken sales rose 10 percent to $2.74 billion as chicken volume rose 6 percent and prices rose 3.7 percent. But operating margins in that unit fell to 1.4 percent from 4.6 percent. In the beef unit, sales rose 18.9 percent to $3.33 billion. Volume dipped 0.6 percent, but prices rose 19.6 percent. Tyson shares were down 5 percent at $17.93 on the New York Stock Exchange.
