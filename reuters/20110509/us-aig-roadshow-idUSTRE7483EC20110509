 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A secondary offering of part of the U.S. government's stake in American International Group( AIG.N ) will likely carry a discount in the mid-single digit percentage range, a person familiar with the process said on Monday. 

 The person, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the roadshow to market the shares had begun and would last about eight days. The U.S. Treasury owns 92.1 percent of AIG. (Reporting by  Clare Baldwin , writing by Ben Berkowitz; editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
