 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Volkswagen ( VOWG_p.DE ) is making an offer for MAN ( MANG.DE ) after it raised its stake in the German truckmaker above 30 percent, prompting a mandatory bid. Analysts see the move by Volkswagen as a way to start the takeover process but still have maximum flexibility. 

 MM WARBURG ANALYST MARC-RENE TONN "This low-ball offer serves to start the takeover process but still have maximum flexibility. The timing of the offer is unexpected, but it was clear it would come eventually." BHF-BANK ANALYST ALEKSEJ WUNRAU "The offer has sparked expectations that Volkswagen will have to raise its offer. "At Scania there is relief that the Swedes will not have to bear the main burden of the integration costs (of a truck merger)." NORDLB ANALYST FRANK SCHWOPE "Volkswagen has a net liquidity of 20 billion euros ($28.8 billion), which it is likely to use. "With the low-ball offer they have a foot in the door and have fulfilled the legal requirements. "It is the same way that Porsche ( PSHG_p.DE ) at the time tried to take over Volkswagen." ETX CAPITAL SENIOR TRADER MARKUS HUBER "This doesn't come as a huge surprise and actually makes perfect sense. In terms of the make-up and strategy of the companies, it is certainly a sensible step for all parties involved. There is some uncertainty surrounding what the cartel authorities will respond to this, but generally I think it is a logical step."
