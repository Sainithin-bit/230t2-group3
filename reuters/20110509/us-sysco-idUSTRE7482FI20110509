 BANGALORE  (Reuters) - Top U.S. food distributor Sysco Corp's ( SYY.N ) market-topping quarterly results boosted investors' confidence in its ability to pass on rising costs to its customers without hurting demand. 

 Shares of the company, which distributes meat and dairy products to restaurants and healthcare facilities, rose 15 percent to $32.76 -- their highest since Oct 2008. Like other food companies, Houston-based Sysco has been struggling with rising costs of meat, poultry and fuel. However, in its latest quarter, the company -- which has a market value of over $18 billion -- was able to grow its volumes even as it raised its prices to offset the higher costs. Hapoalim Securities analyst Ajay Jain said it was encouraging that Sysco's sales beat was not disproportionately driven by price increases. "The improvement in volume trends should be viewed favorably following the unexpected setback last quarter," Jain said. According to his estimates, the company's sales volume grew 2.8 percent in the third quarter, up from 0.3 percent in the second quarter. Food cost inflation -- the estimated change in Sysco's product costs -- was 5.1 percent, mainly due to higher costs of meat and seafood. The company posted a third-quarter net income of $258.5 million, or 44 cents a share, compared with $247.6 million, or 42 cents a share, a year ago. Excluding items, it earned 46 cents a share, beating analysts' average estimate of 41 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales rose 9 percent to $9.76 billion. Analysts were expecting revenue of $9.48 billion. The company's stock was trading up 12 percent at $31.93 on Monday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange. About 32 million shares were traded, more than 7 times their daily average. (Reporting by Mihir Dalal in Bangalore; Editing by Don Sebastian and Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)
