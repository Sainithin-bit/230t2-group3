 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors in New York on Tuesday charged three hedge fund portfolio managers and a hedge fund analyst with insider trading, the latest arrests in the U.S. government's big insider trading probe. This brings to 13 the number of people arrested or charged in the investigation. 

 Here is a list of some of the people involved: SAMIR BARAI Barai, 38, who ran the near $100 million hedge fund, Barai Capital Management, surrendered to police in New York on Tuesday. He is accused of trading on inside information about technology companies after receiving tips from a consultant working for expert network firm Primary Global Research. Barai Capital was one of the hedge funds raided by U.S. investigators in November and has since shut down. Prior to starting his own fund, Barai was a portfolio manager at Citigroup's $2 billion Tribeca Global Management, which was shuttered in 2008. He had also previously worked at Ziff Brothers Investments. DONALD LONGUEUIL Longueuil, 34, hedge fund manager and specialist in the technology and semiconductor sectors, had primary investment discretion over some $300 million at hedge fund SAC Capital, prosecutors said. He is accused of obtaining inside information from expert network consultants and trading on it. He is also accused of destroying a flash drive and external hard drives after reading an article about a federal grand jury investigation into insider trading. Longueuil was arrested on Tuesday. NOAH FREEMAN Freeman, 34, of Boston, Massachusetts, was a former managing director at Boston-based Sonar Capital and a former portfolio manager at SAC Capital Advisors. He has agreed to plead guilty to charges relating to insider trading. Freeman worked at SAC from June 2008 until early 2010. JASON PFLAUM Pflaum, 37, is a former technology industry research analyst for Barai Capital, who worked at the fund in New York from about mid-2008 through October 2010. On Tuesday, he agreed to plead guilty to trading off of inside information. BOB NGUYEN Nguyen, 32, a former technology analyst with Primary Global Research, worked for the company from January 2008 to February 2010. He pleaded guilty in January to leaking confidential corporate information to hedge funds. "One of the goals of PGR was to recruit experts at companies to provide certain material nonpublic information," Nguyen said in his allocution hearing. WINIFRED JIAU Jiau, 43, was arrested in December. Prosecutors accused her of selling inside information about publicly traded companies, including computer chipmakers Marvell Technology Group Ltd and Nvidia Corp, to hedge funds. Jiau worked as a consultant for expert network firm Primary Global Research, according to the complaint. She is in custody and was named as the consultant who tipped Barai and Freeman about Marvell's earnings results. WALTER SHIMOON Shimoon, arrested in December, was a senior director of business development at Flextronics International. He has been accused of providing confidential information to a hedge fund about Flextronics and Apple Inc, according to a criminal complaint. He is free on bail. MARK ANTHONY "TONY" LONGORIA Longoria, 44, a Round Rock, Texas-based supply chain manager for Advanced Micro Devices Inc, was arrested in December and accused of providing confidential details about revenue and sales to a hedge fund. He was a consultant for Primary Global and is free on bail. JAMES FLEISHMAN Fleishman, 41, of Santa Clara, California, was an account executive responsible for attracting new clients to Primary Global Research. He was arrested in December on charges that he arranged for hedge funds to speak to consultants, knowing the consultants would provide inside information to the funds. He has been placed on leave by Primary Global and is free on bail. MANOSHA KARUNATILAKA Karunatilaka was a manager at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company North America in Massachusetts. He has been accused of having a conversation with a technology analyst at a financial firm in which he provided material nonpublic information about his company and its customers. Karunatilaka was a consultant for Primary Global from 2007 to 2010. His role at Taiwan Semiconductor included forecasting, planning, sales and marketing, according to a Primary Global document. He was arrested in January. KARL MOTEY Motey, an independent technology consultant at Coda Group Inc in Los Altos, California, pleaded guilty to conspiracy and securities fraud last year and is cooperating with prosecutors. He made phone calls to gather evidence for prosecutors, including confidential information from sources at Marvell Technology and had obtained insider information from a source at United Microelectronics Corp, according to court documents. DANIEL DEVORE DeVore, a global supply manager at Dell Computer, is cooperating with the probe. He has pleaded guilty to securities fraud in connection with his work as an "expert network" consultant for Primary Global Research, Guidepoint Global and Vista, according to court papers. DON CHING TRANG CHU Chu, an executive at California research firm Primary Global Research, was arrested in November on charges that he introduced hedge funds to executives who gave them insider trading information. Primary Global said it has cut ties with Chu, who worked as a Taiwan Liaison at Primary Global. RICHARD CHOO-BENG LEE Lee pleaded guilty in 2009 in the insider-trading prosecution of Galleon Group hedge fund founder Raj Rajaratnam and 22 other traders. Lee, who once worked for hedge fund SAC Capital, was identified as a cooperating witness in some of the recent complaints. JOHN KINNUCAN Kinnucan is the owner of a Portland, Oregon-based technology research firm who was contacted by two FBI agents last year and asked to wear a wire for the U.S. government. He refused to cooperate and sent an e-mail to clients the next day warning them that an investigation was under way. He has been subpoenaed as part of the probe, but has not been charged with a crime or arrested. DR. YVES BENHAMOU Benhamou, a French infectious disease specialist, was arrested in November on charges of passing illegal tips about negative results in an experimental Human Genome Sciences Inc drug trial to FrontPoint, a hedge fund owned by Morgan Stanley. Benhamou's bail was set at $3 million. FrontPoint, after facing big redemptions, elected to shut down the healthcare funds linked to the scandal. Benhamou does not appear to be linked to the recent arrests, but was affiliated with an expert network as well. (Compiled by Emily Chasan)
