 ZURICH  (Reuters) - UBS expects to win more client money for its wealth management business in 2011 and sees a rebound in the investment banking division whose losses almost felled it in the financial crisis. 

 Switzerland's biggest bank said it had seen improvement across private banking in the fourth quarter -- with total net new money of 7.1 billion Swiss francs -- although inflows were flat at its core wealth management unit after 1 billion in the third quarter and big withdrawals in the first half. While the bank won client cash in the Asia Pacific and Americas regions and among the ultra wealthy and Swiss customers, it continued to bleed a small amount of assets both onshore and offshore in Europe, where neighboring countries have chased tax evaders hiding behind Swiss bank secrecy. "It's really the confidence that we have around the situation in Europe changing and improving that gives us confidence that we will see net inflows in coming quarters," said Chief Financial Officer John Cryan. Clients rattled by huge writedowns on toxic assets and a U.S. probe into wealthy Americans using secret Swiss accounts to dodge tax had pulled nearly 400 billion francs from the world's second-largest wealth manager in recent years. "The results are a relief after the poor results of U.S. brokers and those from Deutsche Bank and even Julius Baer," said Helvea analyst Peter Thorne. "It is a relief to hear their optimism for 2011." Solid wealth management performances from smaller Swiss wealth manager Julius Baer and Morgan Stanley in the fourth quarter, along with improved UBS investment banking, bode well for the Q4 results of cross-town rival Credit Suisse, due Thursday. UBS shares were up 2.8 percent at 1333 GMT, against a 1.6 percent gain for Credit Suisse and a 0.1 percent weaker European STOXX banks index. CEO Oswald Gruebel's investment bank revamp started to bear fruit in the fourth quarter as equities and fixed income, commodities and currencies (FICC) revenues improved. "Mr Gruebel has done a good job in rebuilding UBS so far. He announced a mid-term target of 15 billion Swiss francs profit before taxes and there is currently no reason for questioning his role," said Oliver Flade, research director for European financials at Allianz Global Investors, a small UBS shareholder. CHARGES HIT PROFIT Analysts said litigation charges of 230 million francs and an own credit charge of 509 million in the investment bank mainly explained why quarterly profit missed forecasts. The own credit charge, as well as losses on student loans, kept net profit at the investment bank to just 75 million Swiss francs ($78.35 million). "Highlights were an increase in FICC and equity trading revenues in Q4/Q3 against the trend of peers, net new money just positive in wealth management and a 1 percent jump in the Tier 1 to 17.7 percent," said Nomura analyst Jon Pearce. "Net we see slightly more for the bulls than the bears." U.S. banks reported weak investment banking activity in the fourth quarter, with Goldman Sachs suffering a year-end slump in trading revenue, while Deutsche Bank's fourth quarter profit missed expectations. "Our investment bank performance, while considerably improved, is clearly not yet satisfactory for us. Here we have to work hard in 2011, which will include lowering the cost/income ratio," Gruebel told a news conference, adding that improving client activity could give the unit a boost. "The investments that we have made in many areas of the investment bank, particularly in our FICC businesses should start to pay off and generate more value for our shareholders this year," the former trader said. UBS was forced to cut risky but potentially very profitable proprietary trading in favor of client flow business after it took huge losses in the financial crisis, pushing it to take a bailout from the Swiss government in 2008. Wealth management revenues rose 2 percent in the fourth quarter, though the unprecedented strength of the Swiss franc partly offset increased client activity, UBS said. The Americas business attracted 3.4 billion francs of new money, demonstrating it was rebuilding client trust after a tax dispute that forced UBS to hand account data to U.S. authorities. However the unit remained unprofitable due to the litigation charges. UBS said its BIS tier 1 capital ratio rose to 17.7 percent from 16.7 percent the previous quarter -- among the strongest in the industry -- as it reiterated it did not plan to pay a dividend for 2010 or some time to come as it retains earnings to build capital to meet tough new regulatory requirements. The bank, which is still the focus of Swiss public hostility after booking the biggest loss in the country's history in 2008, said it would pay out 10 percent less in bonuses for 2010, cutting the bonus pool to 4.3 billion francs. It also said 1.550 billion francs of the bonus pool would be deferred to future years, with employees who earn over 250,000 francs receiving at least 60 percent of their bonus in shares deferred over three years.
