 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Global trading volumes should ramp up this year after a sluggish latter half of 2010, and the global economy should "officially" recover, the head of exchange operator NYSE Euronext NYX.NNYX.PA said on Tuesday. 

 "We see the health of corporate balance sheets. We see the return of corporate profitability. We see the global economy growing, and therefore believe it's likely that volumes will increase when compared to the second half of 2010," Chief Executive Duncan Niederauer said on a conference call with analysts and media.
