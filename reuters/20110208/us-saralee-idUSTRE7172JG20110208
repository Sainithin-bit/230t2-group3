 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Don't tear Sara Lee Corp SLE.N down from atop that auction block just yet. 

 The company has attracted takeover interest from enough parties that tax restrictions following its planned spin-off may not hinder a possible sale of the parts, according to its chief executive. That news cheered investors who thought the spin-off -- announced last month after Sara Lee failed to receive a satisfactory bid for the company as a whole -- meant that the parts would not be bought for as long as two years due to restrictions meant to preserve the tax-free nature of the spin-off. "From a shareholder perspective, if it gives you comfort, there are enough people out there that would be totally unrestricted," Smits said. He added that the restrictions, which could range from six months to two years, would only apply to buyers who have engaged in "substantial negotiations" with the company prior to the split. Sara Lee shares were up 1.8 percent in afternoon trading, after rising as much 2.7 percent. Before the comments, its shares were down slightly. Morningstar analyst Erin Lash said Smits' comments made it sound as if those timing impediments could be less of a hurdle than anticipated. Sara Lee said last month that it planned to spin off its North American meats business into a new publicly traded company that will keep the "Sara Lee" name. The remaining company will be an international coffee and tea business whose name has yet to be determined. Sara Lee also said on Tuesday that it would be raising prices again on its products as it struggles with rising costs for commodities such as wheat, coffee and meat. Given the delicate state of consumer spending, price increases could lead some consumers to switch to cheaper brands, the company said. The maker of Jimmy Dean sausages, Ball Park hot dogs and Senseo coffee also reported a weaker-than-expected profit for the latest quarter. PRICES UP, VOLUMES DOWN The company said net income was $880 million, or $1.37 per share, for the quarter that ended on January 1, up from $371 million, or 53 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding a gain on the sale of discontinued operations, a tax benefit and other items, earnings from continuing operations were 24 cents per share, a penny short of the analysts' average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net sales slipped 0.4 percent to $2.35 billion, as lower volumes and a weaker euro offset price increases and a larger proportion of higher-priced goods. Analysts on average were expecting $2.52 billion. In the company's North American meats business, which also includes Hillshire Farm lunch meat, sales rose 1 percent despite a 4.9 percent decline in volume, as the company raised prices to offset the rising commodity costs. In the international beverage business, which includes Douwe Egberts and L'Or, net sales rose 2 percent, despite a 2 percent decline in volume. Sara Lee's shares were up 1.8 percent, or 32 cents, at $17.24 on the New York Stock Exchange, after falling as low as $16.76. (Reporting by Martinne Geller; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn and Maureen Bavdek)
