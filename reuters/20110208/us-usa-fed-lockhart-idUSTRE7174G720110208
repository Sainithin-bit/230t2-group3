 ANNISTON, Alabama  (Reuters) - Inflation is still below the central bank's comfort level and increases in prices for specific goods and services do not signal broader inflation is around the corner, a top Federal Reserve policymaker said on Tuesday. 

 Dennis Lockhart, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, noted "inflation anxiety is rising" in the general public. He used his speech to lay out the difference between broad inflation and the cost of living -- which can rise with prices for specific items like food and gas. Lockhart said monetary policy is too blunt a tool to tackle individual price rises. "For the moment, inflation, properly defined, is tame, in my view. And the rise of individual prices does not signal incipient inflation," Lockhart told the Calhoun County Chamber of Commerce. "Underlying inflation is currently below the level that I would define as price stability," he said, a view in line with his previous comments. Lockhart said he expects core inflation to rise gradually, to within the Fed's informal 2 percent target range by 2013. While headline inflation has picked up in the United States, core inflation has held near a five-decade low. "The Fed, like every other central bank, is powerless to prevent fluctuations in the cost of living and increases of individual prices. We do not produce oil. Nor do we grow food or provide health care," he said. Some analysts have blamed the Fed's easy money policy for flooding the global economy with money and helping to drive prices for food and other commodities higher. Lockhart said blaming the Fed for inflation overseas was "unfair". "Emerging market central banks have the capacity to deal with inflation in their own economies," he said in response to an audience question. Inflation below its comfort level was a reason the Fed embarked on a second round of bond buying in November. Lockhart said the $600 billion program is already working. "Over the last months of the year, in anticipation of the policy move, the probability of deflation, as measured by Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) began to decline, fears of a double-dip recession started to fade, and equity prices resumed their climb," he said. Lockhart said it is unlikely jobs growth will be strong enough in 2011 to generate "quick improvement". At its January 27 meeting, the Fed said high unemployment still justified its bond-buying plan. Regional Fed presidents rotate voting on monetary policy and Lockhart will next vote in 2012. He said he expects moderate growth in 2011, but reiterated that the recovery has been "fitful".
