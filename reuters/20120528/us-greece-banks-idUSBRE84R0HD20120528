 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Greece's bank support fund on Monday disbursed 18 billion euros to the country's four biggest banks as a part of a long-planned recapitalization effort, a fund official said. 
 "The funds have been disbursed," the official at the Hellenic Financial Stability Facility, who declined to be named, told Reuters. The injection - via bonds from the European Financial Stability Facility rescue fund - will boost the capital base of National Bank ( NBGr.AT ), Alpha ( ACBr.AT ), Eurobank EFGr.AT and Piraeus Bank ( BOPr.AT ), allowing them to regain access to European Central Bank funding.
