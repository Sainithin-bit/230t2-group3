 MADRID  (Reuters) - Spain will not resort to external rescue funds to clean-up the country's troubled financial system, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy reiterated on Monday, adding that nationalized lender Bankia ( BKIA.MC ) will be sold once it is cleaned up. 
 Bankia has asked Spain's government for rescue funding of 19 billion euros ($24 billion), beyond 4.5 billion euros it has also received from the government, raising concerns over the potential bill for a rescue of the system as a whole. (Reporting By Sarah White, writing by Tracy Rucinski)
