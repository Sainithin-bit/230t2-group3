 MADRID  (Reuters) - Shares in troubled Spanish lender Bankia ( BKIA.MC ) fell 26.75 percent when trading resumed after stock market regulator CNMV suspended it on Friday, before the bank asked for a 23.5 billion euros bailout. 
 The bank revealed a 2.979 billion euro ($3.73 billion) loss for 2011 after restating its accounts and its parent company BFA (Banco Financiero y de Ahorros) is also set to report heavy losses on Monday. (Reporting by Sarah White and  Julien Toyer )
