 DUBLIN  (Reuters) - Ireland's government will target savings of 4 billion euros in the 2011 budget as it seeks to get its fiscal crisis under control, two Sunday newspapers reported. 

 Finance Minister Brian Lenihan said this week he would need to go above an initial target of 3 billion euros ($4.14 billion) in savings from next year's budget and would unveil a four-year fiscal plan in November after estimating the cost of saving the banking system could top 50 billion euros. Citing unnamed sources, The Sunday Business Post reported Lenihan would need a 4 billion euros package for the 2011 plan, which will be unveiled on Dec 7. The Sunday Tribune, also citing unnamed sources, said savings of up to 4.5 billion euros would be needed in Ireland's fourth austerity budget in two years. The Sunday Tribune also reported that adjustments of at least 6-7 billion euros would be needed in the following three budgets. A spokesman for the Department of Finance declined to comment on the reports. ($1=.7250 Euro) (Reporting by Carmel Crimmins; Editing by  Jonathan Thatcher  and Jon Loades-Carter)
