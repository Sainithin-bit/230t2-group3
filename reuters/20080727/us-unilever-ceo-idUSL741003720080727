 LONDON  (Reuters) - Anglo-Dutch consumer goods company Unilever ( ULVR.L ) is searching for a successor to Chief Executive Patrick Cescau to take the helm of the group next year, newspaper reports said on Sunday. 

 The Sunday Times and The Sunday Telegraph both reported that the company, the maker of Marmite, Pot Noodle and Magnum ice ream, had appointed headhunters at Egon Zehnder to find a suitable replacement for the 59-year-old. A spokesman for Unilever declined to comment. Cescau has been credited with turning the company around since his appointment following a shock profit warning in 2004. He has had to battle with soaring commodity prices, which have pushed up the cost of key products such as vegetable oil and packaging. He has also led a plan to dispose of non-core businesses, and last week sold the group's Bertolli olive oil business to Spanish group SOS Cuetara SOS.MC for 630 million euros ($989.2 million). The reports said he planned to step down of his own accord at the company's annual general meeting in May 2009. Potential replacements include Finance Director Jim Lawrence and head of the foods, home and personal care arm Vindi Banga. (Reporting by  John Bowker , editing by Will Waterman)
