 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Italian shoe maker Geox SpA ( GEO.MI ) could see its revenues and stock price rise in the coming years as it executes its expansion plan, according to a report in the latest issue of Barron's financial newspaper. 

 After a recent sell-off in the shares, fueled by disappointing sales and profit growth and a reduced earnings forecast, the stock has fallen to levels that underestimate Geox's growth potential, earnings power, and "pristine balance sheet," the paper said in its July 28 edition. Geox shares trade for about 7 euros, and its lightly traded American shares ( GXSBF.PK ) have fallen to $10.70 on the Pink Sheets from $24.15 last October. However, if sales and earnings climb by an expected 15 percent to 20 percent a year, Geox could rally to 9-11 euros in the next two to three years, a gain of 30 percent to 50 percent, the paper said. Geox is "a great company with a temporary problem," Sebastien Mallet, an analyst with T. Rowe Price, which owns about 5.27 million shares, told Barron's. The United States, home to just 16 Geox stores, accounts for a mere 3 percent of total sales, but U.S.-based sales rose 28 percent -- or 40 percent in dollars -- in 2007, even without the benefit of heavy advertising, the paper said. Europe currently accounts for 83 percent of Geox sales. Geox hopes to have 30 stores in the U.S. by year end, the paper said, citing comments from the company's chief financial officer. That number could double by 2010, and reach 100 or more afterward. Geox will open about 400 new stores in Europe in the next three years and ramp up expansion in Southeast Asia, China and Japan, where it has a small presence. Geox sales could double to 1.6 billion euros in five years, according to Scilla Huang Sun, a portfolio manager at Bank Julius Baer, the paper said.
