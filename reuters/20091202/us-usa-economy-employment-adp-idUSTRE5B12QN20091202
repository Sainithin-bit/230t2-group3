 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. private employers shed 169.000 jobs in November, fewer than the 195,000 jobs lost in October, a report by a private employment service said on Wednesday. 

 The October fall was originally reported at 203,000. The median of estimates from 30 economists surveyed by Reuters for the ADP Employer Services report, jointly developed with Macroeconomic Advisers LLC, was for decline of 155,000 private-sector jobs last month. (Reporting by  Nick Olivari )
