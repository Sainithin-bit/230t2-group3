 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. private employers shed 169,000 jobs in November, fewer than the 195,000 jobs lost in October, a report by a private employment service said on Wednesday. 

 KEY POINTS: * The October fall was originally reported at 203,000. * The median of estimates from 30 economists surveyed by Reuters for the ADP Employer Services report, jointly developed with Macroeconomic Advisers LLC, was for decline of 155,000 private-sector jobs last month. COMMENTS: STEVEN WOOD, CHIEF ECONOMIST, INSIGHT ECONOMICS, DANVILLE, CALIFORNIA: "Civilian jobs declined substantially in November although at their slowest rate in a year-and-a-half. Moreover, the decline was substantially less of the job losses that were experienced in March 2009, which were horrific. The magnitude of the job losses has progressively diminished over the past 8 months; if this trend were to continue, the job losses would end sometime early next year. Nevertheless, these data portend another large decline in jobs in Friday's employment situation report even as the pace of job loss has decelerated." SEAN SIMKO, FIXED-INCOME PORTFOLIO MANAGER, SEI, OAKS, PENNSYLVANIA: "It was positive that the ADP reading was one of the smallest losses since the summer of last year. "In the labor market in general there is still a lot of healing that needs to be done, while Friday (nonfarm payrolls report) is a wild card." PETER BOOCKVAR, EQUITY STRATEGIST, MILLER TABAK + CO, NEW YORK: "There remains no question that the pace of job losses has slowed but the path to healthy job gains I believe will still be unfortunately long and in order to begin to see a sustainable fall in the unemployment rate, we need to see 125,000-150,000 job gains per month." FRANK LESH, FUTURES ANALYST, FUTUREPATH TRADING LLC, CHICAGO: "You always take the ADP with a grain of salt, it's not always right on. It's still an improvement, maybe not as much as we were looking for -- 155,000 was the guesstimate and we came in at 169,000. Wasn't that far off and it's still an improvement from 190." BRIAN DOLAN, CHIEF CURRENCY STRATEGIST, FOREX.COM, BEDMINISTER, NEW JERSEY: "So far the reaction has been minimal, but overall ADP is worse than expected, so it could be a negative for risk appetite. We're seeing a modestly lower dollar-yen and lower euro. But I have to think that with the ECB tomorrow and U.S. payrolls on Friday we're not going to be going very far today. The fears about Dubai have evaporated, though there may be another hiccup down the road with an individual bank or corporation having problems." ALAN LANCZ, PRESIDENT OF ALAN B. LANCZ & ASSOCIATES INC, TOLEDO, OHIO: "The number is pretty much in line and I don't see it as a major factor either way. From a market standpoint, we're still seeing improvement. This is our eighth straight month of fewer job losses. It may not have been exactly what the market was looking for, but at least the trend is correct. It won't be a major factor today."
