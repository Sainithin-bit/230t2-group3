 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Gold prices rose to record highs on Thursday as worries about the economic recovery encouraged buying of the metal as a safe haven investment. 

 Spot gold rose to a record of $1,218.90 per ounce at 2316 GMT, while U.S. February gold futures touched an all-time high of $1,221.00. (Reporting by  Miho Yoshikawa )
