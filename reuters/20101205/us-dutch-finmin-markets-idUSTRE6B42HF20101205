 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - The Dutch Finance Minister warned on Sunday that investors would turn their attention to other heavily indebted countries, including the United States and Japan, once the euro zone's debt woes have been solved. 

 European financial markets have been jittery in the past week with attention now on the euro zone peripheral countries Portugal and Spain following a rescue package for Ireland from the European Union and International Monetary Fund which was agreed a week ago. "If we have fought the battle of the market against the euro, the euro will prevail. Then the market will again look at other countries outside the euro zone which have much bigger problems with government finances," Dutch Finance Minister Jan Kees de Jager told Dutch television program Brandpunt. "The biggest misunderstanding is perhaps that a country such as Japan, which has twice its economic size as debt, and a country such as the United States have much bigger problems. The market seems to pay little attention to this. Everybody seems to be looking at the euro zone now and that is a bit strange," De Jager said in an interview aired on Brandpunt's Web site.
