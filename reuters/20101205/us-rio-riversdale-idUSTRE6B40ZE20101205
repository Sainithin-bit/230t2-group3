 LONDON  (Reuters) - Global mining group Rio Tinto ( RIO.L ) is in talks over a 2 billion pound ($3.2 billion) bid for Australian rival Riversdale Mining RIV.AX, British newspaper The Sunday Telegraph reported. 

 The British newspaper, citing unnamed sources, said Rio was bidding around A$15 per share for Riversdale, whose shares closed at A$14.10 on December 3. The Sunday Telegraph said it was not certain a deal between the two companies would be completed. A Rio Tinto spokesman in London said the company did not comment on market speculation. Riversdale's major shareholders include Tata Steel ( TISC.BO ), Brazilian steelmaker CSN ( CSNA3.SA ) ( SID.N ) and China's Wuhan Iron & Steel Corp ( 600005.SS ). Riversdale has potentially lucrative assets in Africa and the company announced a coal discovery in Mozambique in October. ($1=.6338 Pound) (Reporting by  Sudip Kar-Gupta ; Editing by Karen Foster)
