 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund's chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn said on Saturday the global economic outlook was "not that bad" but uncertainties remained in the United States and Europe. 

 Following are comments he made in a speech during a conference on development in the Belgian parliament. ON POVERTY "This crisis, and even before, the increases in food and fuel prices, has as a result that ... millions, tens of millions are back in poverty." ON GLOBAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND THE UNITED STATES "It doesn't look that bad. "India expects to have 9 percent growth, China everybody knows, other countries in Asia, even Japan is doing better than previously. "In the U.S. it still uncertain but it depends a lot on the figures we will get for the last quarter of the year, to have a better view on what 2011 will be." ON EUROPE RECOVERY "In Europe, the recovery is obviously sluggish ... Probably it is better than expected but still not the level which is necessary to fight against unemployment." ON CHINA "Chinese growth is impressive. The role played by China in the world economy is on the increase." ON U.S. DOLLAR "I don't think the role of U.S. dollar will disappear or shrink in the near future." ON DEVELOPING COUNTRIES "The need to rebuild fiscal and monetary buffers is a priority." ON IVORY COAST "I am not here to take a stand on the international situation of Ivory Coast. But it is quite sure, in practice, the IMF works with recognized governments, recognized by the United Nations. Hence the stand of IMF will be the stand of the United Nations."
