 DUBLIN  (Reuters) - An opposition Irish MP has offered to throw the government a lifeline by abstaining from the first of three budget votes on Tuesday if government supporters oppose the proposals, a newspaper quoted her as saying on Sunday. 

 Prime Minister Brian Cowen, whose popularity has plunged into the single digits, depends for his majority on two independent lawmakers who have not yet said how they plan to vote. If those two withhold support for the budget, Cowen could need at least one member of the main opposition party Fine Gael to abstain in order to pass it, a prerequisite for ensuring quick access to EU/IMF rescue funds. Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny has repeatedly said he thinks the government will pass the budget on its own, avoiding the issue of members of his party abstaining. His party colleague Lucinda Creighton said she would abstain if necessary. "I would prefer if Fine Gael had an input into this budget, but I don't believe it would be good for the country for this budget to fail," Creighton told the Sunday Business Post. Creighton could not immediately be reached to confirm her intention to abstain. The main details of the budget are already known. It foresees 6 billion euros in savings next year, including roughly 4 billion euros in spending cuts and tax adjustments designed to boost revenues by some 2 billion euros. Deputy Prime Minister Mary Coughlan confirmed on Sunday that members of parliaments were in for a second successive year of pay and pension cuts as part of the package. "All these pensions and salaries will be reduced accordingly on the basis that others have to do with less," Coughlan told national broadcaster RTE, adding that she was confident the budget would pass. Finance Minister Brian Lenihan cut ministerial salaries by 15 percent this time last year and a number of Sunday newspapers put fresh cuts at between 10 and 15 percent. They also reported that Lenihan would cap the pay of semi-state company bosses. However the reported planned capping of public sector pay at between 200,000 and 250,000 euros may only apply to future salaries due to contractual obligations, some of the newspapers said. The Sunday Times said rebel Fianna Fail backbench MP Mattie McGrath would only vote for the budget if some of his key proposals, including the public sector salary cap, were included in Tuesday's announcement.
