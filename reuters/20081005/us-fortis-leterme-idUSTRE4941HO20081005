 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Belgium and Luxembourg are talking to several private groups about the future of troubled financial group Fortis FOR.BR and will send a signal before markets open on Monday, Belgian Prime Minister Yves Leterme said on Sunday. 

 Leterme told Belgian television and radio stations he hoped to keep the Belgian and Luxembourg operations of the banking and insurance group together after the Netherlands nationalized most of Fortis' Dutch units on Friday. "There are contacts with private groups, several private groups. We are not going to decide in this situation with our backs to the wall," he said. "The only thing certain is that we are going to send a clear and strong signal to the markets before they open tomorrow." (Reporting by Paul Taylor, Editing by Philip Blenkinsop and Erica Billingham)
