 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - French bank BNP Paribas was in talks with the Belgian and Luxembourg governments on Sunday to take up to 80 percent of troubled financial group Fortis, Belgian radio RTBF reported. 

 The radio, which stressed nothing had been agreed so far, said the two governments would keep a 20 percent share in Fortis's banks in their countries. In Paris, BNP Paribas spokesman Jonathan Mullen declined to comment. RTBF said the two governments were negotiating at the same time on the future of Franco-Belgian bank Dexia after deepening problems at German mortgage lender Hypo Real Estate raised fresh questions about last week's public bailout of the bank.
