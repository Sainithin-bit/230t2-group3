 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - No. 1 toy company Mattel Inc ( MAT.O ) surprised Wall Street with a quarterly profit on strong demand for its classic brands and newer product lines as parents spent generously on kids despite tight budgets. 

 The news pushed Mattel's shares to their highest level since July 2007 and bode well for rival Hasbro HAS.N, which will report results next week. Mattel, the maker of Barbie dolls and Hot Wheels cars, said customers reacted well to its recent line of action figures based on popular World Wrestling Entertainment ( WWE.N ) characters such as "Triple H" and "The Undertaker." It is also seeing strong demand for its new toys under the "Thomas & Friends" and the "Toy Story 3" licenses. "This seems like a great quarter any way you cut it," Wells Fargo analyst Timothy Conder said in a note to clients. Conder backed his "outperform" rating on Mattel and said the results coupled with strong free cash generation and a solid balance sheet bode well for the toy maker. Mattel is or was a client of Wells Fargo during the past 12 months, according to Conder's note. Mattel's report pointed to improving demand for toys and other children's merchandise, but according to one analyst, the results could not be extrapolated to broader consumer spending. "When they have a budget, they don't scrimp on the kids. They cut out elsewhere," BMO Capital Markets analyst Gerrick Johnson said. Johnson said the toy industry was doing better than other consumer segments. He preferred Mattel to Hasbro as the larger toy maker's core brands and stock have more room to grow. He rates Mattel an "outperform," while giving Hasbro a "market perform" rating. "They are at the  earlier stages of a cyclical upturn for their brands," Johnson said of Mattel. "Also, there is a lot of risk with Hasbro and their strategy to create this new cable network." BMO Capital Markets makes a market in Mattel. Hasbro is in a joint venture with Discovery Communications Inc ( DISCA.O ) to form a new children's television network -- The Hub -- and the creation of Hasbro Studios. Mattel said its retailers were more bullish about the 2010 holiday season than the 2009 one, but added it was unsure if the positive sentiment would lead retailers to increase inventory. The toy maker also warned investors about gross margin pressures in the second half of the year on rising input and other costs. Mattel said its first-quarter net profit was $24.8 million, or 7 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier net loss of $51 million, or 14 cents a share. Analysts on average were expecting a loss of 3 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net sales rose 12 percent to $880.1 million, boosted by both U.S. and international markets. The analysts' average estimate was $860 million. While sales increased 5 percent for both Barbie and Fisher-Price brands, they rose 9 percent at Hot Wheels and 6 percent at American Girl. In early afternoon trade on the Nasdaq, Mattel shares were up 1 percent to $23.92; while Hasbro shares on the New York Stock Exchange were down 0.3 percent to $40.01.
