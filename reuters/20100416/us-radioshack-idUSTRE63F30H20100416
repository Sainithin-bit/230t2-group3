 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - RadioShack Corp ( RSH.N ) Chief Executive Officer Julian Day received total compensation of nearly $8.1 million last year, up 47.6 percent from 2008 due to sharp increases in his incentive bonus and stock option awards, according to a regulatory filing on  Friday. 

 Day, who became CEO of the electronics retailer in 2006, earned a base salary of slightly more than $1 million last year, in line with his salary in 2008 and 2007, according to a proxy statement filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. But Day's option awards jumped to about $5 million from $3.2 million, while his incentive bonus rose to $2 million from $1.2 million, according to the filing. The Fort Worth, Texas-based retailer's revenues rose 1.2 percent to $4.28 billion in 2009, and its net income increased 8.2 percent to $205 million. The company has scheduled its annual meeting to take place May 24 in Santa Monica, California. (Reporting by  Phil Wahba ; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
