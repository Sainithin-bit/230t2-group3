 (Reuters) - Health insurer WellPoint Inc ( WLP.N ) plans to buy contact-lens and eyewear retailer 1-800 Contacts Inc for a transaction value close to $900 million, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing a person familiar with the matter. 
 The deal will close in the third quarter and will start adding to the company's per-share earnings in 2014, the Journal said in its report. The deal will be financed with cash on hand, the report said. "We see a unique way of tying 1-800 Contacts into our product design," WellPoint Chief Financial Officer Wayne DeVeydt is quoted as saying in the report. WellPoint would also get "a diversified revenue stream into a higher-margin business," the report said, quoting the CFO. 1-800 Contacts has after-tax margins in the "double digit range," compared with around 4 percent to 5 percent across WellPoint's health-insurance business lines, the report quoted DeVeydt as saying. WellPoint and 1-800 Contacts Inc could not reached for comments by Reuters. (Reporting by  Bijoy Koyitty  in Bangalore; Editing by Jon Loades-Carter)
