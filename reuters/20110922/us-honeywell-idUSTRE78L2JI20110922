 (Reuters) - Diversified manufacturer Honeywell International Inc ( HON.N ) said on Thursday its third-quarter earnings will likely be at the high end of its forecasted range of 96 cents per share to $1.01 per share. 

 The maker of cockpit electronics, auto products and control systems for buildings, also repeated its July forecast that calls for 2011 proforma earnings of $3.85 a share to $4 a share on sales of $36.1 billion to $36.7 billion. Analysts, on average, expect Honeywell to earn $1.00 per share in the third quarter and $3.97 a share for the year, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Honeywell's reaffirmation of earnings targets comes as a peer United Technologies Corp ( UTX.N ), set a $16.5 cash deal to buy Goodrich Corp GR.N to build critical mass in the aerospace market.
