 (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard Co announced on Thursday that former eBay Inc Chief Executive Meg Whitman will replace Leo Apotheker as CEO, effective immediately. 

 The largest U.S. technology company said in a statement it will also appoint a lead independent director "promptly." Ray Lane becomes executive chairman of the board, moving from non-executive chairman previously. "We are at a critical moment and we need renewed leadership to successfully implement our strategy and take advantage of the market opportunities ahead," Lane said in the statement.
