 PARIS  (Reuters) - French financial services group Oddo & Cie said on Tuesday it is suing Swiss bank UBS as Oddo seeks to recover 30 million euros ($39.9 million) invested with accused U.S. swindler Bernard Madoff. 

 An Oddo spokesman in Paris said his company had launched legal proceedings against UBS in Luxembourg. UBS was a custodian for the Luxembourg-based LuxAlpha fund in which Oddo held clients' shares. Some clients of UBS invested in Madoff-related products via the LuxAlpha fund. Oddo sold the shares it held for its clients in LuxAlpha on November 4 -- a month before the Madoff scandal broke -- but has not received the money, the Oddo spokesman said. UBS declined to comment on Oddo's lawsuit. ($1=.7520 Euro) (Reporting by Pascale Denis, additional reporting by Elisabetta Jucca; Editing by Erica Billingham)
