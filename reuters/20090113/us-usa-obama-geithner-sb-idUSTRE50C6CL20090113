 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The top Republican on the U.S. Senate Finance Committee is 'raising questions' about the immigration status of a housekeeper that worked for U.S. Treasury Secretary nominee Timothy Geithner and years in which Geithner allegedly did not pay some taxes for himself, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday. 

 Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa "is raising questions about a housekeeper that worked briefly for Treasury Secretary-nominee Timothy Geithner without proper immigration papers, and multiple years when Mr. Geithner didn't pay Social Security and Medicare taxes for himself." A spokeswoman for Grassley said she could not comment on the report, but said members of the Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over Geithner's nomination, were meeting to discuss the matter.
