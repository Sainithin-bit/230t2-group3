 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said on Tuesday he believes he will get the needed votes to provide the remaining $350 billion of the financial industry bailout to President-elect Barack Obama. 

 "I think we will get the necessary votes, I feel very confident about that," the Nevada Democrat told reporters after Senate Democrats met with Obama for an hour to discuss the bailout program. There have been bipartisan calls for tougher restrictions on the money. Republican Sen. David Vitter introduced a resolution of disapproval that would block the release of remaining $350 billion from the $700 billion bailout program.
