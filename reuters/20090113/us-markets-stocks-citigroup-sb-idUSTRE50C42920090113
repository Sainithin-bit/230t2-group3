 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of Citigroup Inc dropped more than 9 percent to $5.00 after the opening of trade on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday as investors fretted about the bank's outlook and fears of more credit losses ahead mounted. 

 The Financial Select Sector SPDR, an exchange-traded fund which tracks the performance of stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500 financials group, declined nearly 2 percent. (Reporting by  Ellis Mnyandu ; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
