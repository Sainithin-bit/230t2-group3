 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The second half of $700 billion in financial rescue funds is needed to stem the pace of home foreclosures and provide relief to those at risk, the chairman of the House Financial Services said on Tuesday. 

 "If we do not get the second $350 billion I do not see anywhere that we can get substantial foreclosure relief," said Rep. Barney Frank, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee at a hearing on the use of financial rescue funds. (Reporting by  Nancy Waitz )
