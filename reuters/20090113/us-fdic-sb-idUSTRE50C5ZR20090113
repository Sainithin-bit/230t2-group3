 WASHINGTON  Jan 13 (Reuters) - A top bank regulator said on  Tuesday the U.S. government should return to its original plan  to buy toxic assets from financial institutions. 

 John Bovenzi, chief operating officer for the Federal  Deposit Insurance Corp, told lawmakers that "a key component" of  the second half of the government's $700 billion financial  bailout fund should be removing problem assets from the balance  sheets of banks and related entities. "Such a program is necessary to expand banks' balance sheet  capacity to undertake new lending as well as to attract private  equity investment," Bovenzi said in prepared remarks to the  House Financial Services Committee. The FDIC's comments echo ones made earlier on Tuesday by  Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke. He said the government  could consider buying troubled assets, providing asset  guarantees, or setting up a so-called bad bank to take over  assets in exchange for cash and equity.
