 MOSCOW  (Reuters) - The chief executive of Glencore declined to comment on Thursday on reports that the commodities trading house is in talks to merge with miner Xstrata. 
 Ivan Glasenberg, in Moscow for a financial conference, rebuffed reporters' questions and referred them to a statement by Xstrata that the two companies were in talks on an all-share merger of equals. "You should see the announcement made by Xstrata, and that's it," Glasenberg said. (Reporting by Katya Golubkova, Writing by Douglas Busvine)
