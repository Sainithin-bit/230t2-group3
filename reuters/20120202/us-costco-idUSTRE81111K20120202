 (Reuters) - U.S. warehouse club operator Costco Wholesale Corp ( COST.O ) posted a better-than-expected 8 percent rise in January sales at stores open at least a year, helped by higher gasoline prices. 
 Net sales at Issaquah, Washington-based Costco rose 11 percent to $7 billion in the four weeks ended January 29. Analysts were expecting same-store sales to rise 6.1 percent, including the impact of fuel prices, according to Thomson Reuters data. Excluding the impact of gasoline prices and foreign exchange, comparable January same-store sales were up 8 percent, Costco said.
