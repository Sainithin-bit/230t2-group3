 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Ketchup maker H.J. Heinz Co. HNZ.N posted lower quarterly profit on Thursday, hurt by a higher tax rate, but raised its full-year earnings forecast based on sales of new products and cost cuts. 

 The maker of Heinz condiments, Ore-Ida frozen potatoes and a host of other packaged foods also said profit in Europe rose 9.7 percent before one-time items as the company has cut costs and sold off businesses to try to improve results in that region. The company, which in June announced a new plan to cut jobs and increase spending on new products and marketing, said profit fell to $191.6 million, or 57 cents a share, in the fiscal second quarter ended November 1, from $203.8 million, or 60 cents a share, a year earlier. Its effective tax rate was 34.8 percent in the quarter, compared with 23.8 percent a year earlier, when the company reversed a tax provision related to a foreign affiliate. Heinz expects its tax rate from continuing operations to be 30 percent for the full year. Earnings from continuing operations were 59 cents a share. Analysts on average had forecast 60 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. The results follow a contentious battle in which activist investor Nelson Peltz and his Trian Group won two seats on Heinz's board of directors. Investors were looking to see whether better-than-expected results posted for the first quarter would continue. "While the second quarter was not quite as impressive as the first, sales and profits advanced in every division absent the effect of the divestitures and currency," Christopher Growe, analyst at A.G. Edwards, said in a research note. Sales rose 3.5 percent to $2.23 billion, helped by higher prices and the impact of the weaker dollar, which raises the value of sales outside the United States when they are reported in dollars on the company's income statement. Divestitures, net of acquisitions, cut sales by 2.6 percent, the company said. Volume, a measure of sales that eliminates price and currency fluctuations, rose 3.5 percent, helped by sales of frozen entrees and new products in Australia and New Zealand. Heinz said it has introduced more than 100 new products this year, including Classico organic pasta sauce in the United States and variations of Plasmon baby food in Italy for infants with digestion problems, difficulty sleeping, food allergies or who are underweight. Sales rose 7.5 percent in the North American consumer products segment, with volume up 4.7 percent. Sales in Europe fell 0.8 percent but were up 4.4 percent excluding divestitures and acquisitions. In the past year, Heinz has sold off some businesses in Europe, including its seafood business. It also cut some prices as it tries to improve results that have been hit by higher costs and the growth of deep discount retailers. Heinz said it now expects earnings per share for the year of $2.35 to $2.39, up a bit from its previous forecast of $2.35 a share. Analysts on average have expected $2.34 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Heinz shares were up 33 cents at $44.30 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock is up 31 percent this year, boosted by both Peltz's interest in the company and improving results. Heading into Thursday, the stock traded at about 18.7 times estimated 2007 earnings, compared with a multiple of 21.3 for ConAgra Foods Inc. ( CAG.N ) and 21.1 for Sara Lee Corp. SLE.N, two other packaged food companies that have been undergoing restructurings.
