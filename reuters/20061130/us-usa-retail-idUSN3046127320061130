 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Steep discounts, combined with warm and wet weather, led to a less-than-stellar November sales for many chains, despite heavy shopper turnout for the kick-off of the holiday season, retailers said on Thursday. 

 "For a second straight month, a majority of U.S. retailers missed expectations," said Ken Perkins, president of research firm Retail Metrics. "Fifty-six percent of retailers fell short of forecasts, well above the long-term four-year average of just 42 percent." Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world's largest retailer, said sales at its U.S. stores open at least a year fell 0.1 percent, the first such decline since April 1996. Now that "Black Friday," the day after Thanksgiving and the traditional start to the holiday season, is in the rear-view mirror, all eyes are on December, the busiest shopping month. Wal-Mart said same-store sales should be flat to up 1 percent in December, a forecast JP Morgan analyst Charles Grom called "sobering." Several other retailers also missed Wall Street's expectations, which could indicate consumers are shying away from purchases because of high heating costs and a slowing housing market, or waiting for last-minute deals. Wal-Mart shares closed down 1.7 percent on the New York Stock Exchange, a steeper drop than the S&P retailing index .GSPMS, which excludes Wal-Mart. One of the bright spots in the 28-member index was Macy's and Bloomingdale's owner Federated Department Stores Inc., which posted stronger-than-expected sales and closed up 3 percent. Shoppers fed up with last year's crowds at big box stores such as Wal-Mart may have been enticed by the early mall promotions this year, said Mark Rein, director of strategic consulting in the retail group at Maritz Research. "I think that shoppers have, to some extent, voted with their feet and their feet are saying: 'You know, I want to go to the mall,'" said Rein. Overall, same-store sales for the companies that have reported so far rose 2.1 percent compared with analysts' expectations for a 2.2 percent increase, Retail Metrics said. The Goldman Sachs department store index was up 5.3 percent, above its expectations for 3.8 percent growth. LOOKING AHEAD This year, December results could be even more critical than usual since Christmas falls on a Monday, giving shoppers that one final full weekend to load up on last-minute presents. Also, Thanksgiving fell on November 23 this year, a day earlier than in 2005, providing an additional shopping day between Thanksgiving and Christmas. Much of the sales during the weekend after Thanksgiving were driven by so-called "door-buster" specials on popular items such as high-definition televisions, digital cameras and cashmere sweaters, but many consumers steered clear of full-priced items. Maritz Research's Rein -- who on Black Friday studied shopper traffic at Minnesota's Mall of America, the largest U.S. shopping mall -- said Macy's was 10 times busier than a year earlier. But Federated used significant discounts to drive sales, "so we may see margins suffer in the long run," he said. Other chains posted mixed results, with retailers such as AnnTaylor Stores Corp. blaming balmy temperatures for keeping consumers from buying sweaters and coats. Heavy rainfall in the Pacific Northwest and East Coast may also have kept some away. Chains such as J.C. Penney Co. Inc. and Gap Inc. also disappointed Wall Street. Major discount chains all missed Wall Street's forecasts -- except for Target Corp. -- and specialty stores were weak, with struggling Pier 1 Imports Inc. and Sharper Image Corp. posting double-digit declines. Upscale department store Nordstrom Inc.'s sales growth fell just short of Wall Street's average expectation, but said most of its holiday sales volume comes in the two weeks before Christmas. "The company does not view Black Friday or the Thanksgiving weekend as particularly critical to overall holiday business," Nordstrom said in a recorded message. Limited Brands Inc., whose Victoria's Secret intimate apparel chain had its best holiday kick-off ever, said December sales should rise in the high-single-digit percentage range, while Target said its same-store sales should rise 3.5 percent to 5.5 percent. Much of the buzz coming from the post-Thanksgiving weekend was generated by shoppers filling stores such as Best Buy Co. Inc. looking for deals on items such as flat-panel televisions. But electronics retailers did not divulge their sales on Thursday, leaving investors to wait and see if the long lines translated into strong profits.
