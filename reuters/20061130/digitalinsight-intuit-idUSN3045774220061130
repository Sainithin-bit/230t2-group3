 NEW YORK  Nov 30 (Reuters) - Intuit Inc. ( INTU.O ) said on
Thursday it will buy Digital Insight Corp. DGIN.O for $1.35
billion, a move that expands the maker of TurboTax and Quicken
financial software into online banking software and services.  No. 7 ranked software company Intuit said it would pay $39
per share, a premium of 18 percent to Digital Insight's close
of $33 on Nasdaq on Wednesday. Digital Insight shares rose 16
percent to $38.22 in trading, while Intuit fell 24 cents to
$31.65 in midday trading.  The acquisition is Intuit's largest since it bought
TurboTax in 1994 and expands its business into providing
regional and community banks that have up to $30 billion in
assets with out sourced online banking.  Bringing Digital Insight into the fold could move Intuit up
a notch in the software rankings, according to Albert Pang,
research director for enterprise applications at research firm
IDC.  Intuit likely will be able to find new customers for its
other software products in the customers of the banks and
financial institutions that use Digital Insight's online
banking products, Pang said.  "Competitors such as H&R Block ( HRB.N ), Microsoft ( MSFT.O )
and Sage Group ( SGE.L ) can't do that because they don't have
that direct access to financial institutions," he said.  The transaction is expected to reduce Intuit's adjusted
earnings by 2 cents to 3 cents per share in its current fiscal
year and add to earnings starting in fiscal 2008, Intuit said.  In an interview, Intuit Chief Executive Steve Bennett said
Digital Insight, which will be run as a unit, would work to
integrate some aspects of Intuit's software into its online
banking products.  Digital Insights has a steadier income stream from
recurring and subscriber revenue than Intuit's tax season-
related products, but because it will account for only about 10
percent of Intuit's annual sales of $2.5 billion, it will ease
but not negate the company's seasonality related to tax
returns, Bennett said.  Intuit reported a net loss in the most recent quarter of
$58.9 million, or 17 cents per share, while revenue rose 19
percent to $362.1 million.  Mountain View, California-based Intuit plans to finance the
transaction with a combination of cash and up to $1 billion of
debt. It expects the deal to close in the first calendar
quarter of 2007.  The $39 per share bid by Intuit is 32 times fiscal 2007
earnings-per-share estimates.  In the most recent software sector deal of similar size,
drug wholesaler McKesson Corp. ( MCK.N ) offered $28 per share
for software and services company Per-Se Technologies Inc.
( PSTI.O ). That price tag had a multiple of 29 times Per-Se's
anticipated 2007 earnings per share.  Other deals this year have included a private equity buyout
of financial software provider Open Solutions Inc. ( OPEN.O )
announced in October for $38 per share. That offer is worth
nearly 36 times the estimated earnings per share for the
software maker in 2007.
