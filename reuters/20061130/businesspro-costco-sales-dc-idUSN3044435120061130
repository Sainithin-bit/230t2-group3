 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Costco Wholesale Corp. ( COST.O ) on 
Thursday said November sales rose 5 percent at stores open at 
least a year, shy of Wall Street expectations, held back by 
falling prices for gasoline sold at its filling stations. 

  Analysts on average had expected the largest U.S. warehouse 
club operator to post a same-store sales increase of 6 percent, 
according to estimates gathered by Reuters.  Total sales for the four weeks ended on November 26 rose 9 
percent to $4.45 billion.  Investors are watching November sales reports particularly 
closely for clues on holiday spending trends after Wal-Mart 
Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) gave a surprisingly weak preliminary sales 
figure on Saturday.  Wal-Mart and other major retailers will release final sales 
reports later on Thursday.  On a recording detailing its November sales performance, 
Costco said the average price per gallon of gasoline it sold 
was $2.20 in November, down from $2.28 a year earlier.  The retailer also noted weak demand in its media and 
housewares departments. Food, candy, deli and big-ticket items 
such as televisions sold well.  International same-store sales were up 10 percent, well 
ahead of the 4 percent gain at the U.S. stores. Costco said 
Korea and Japan were its strongest markets, and foreign 
exchange rates helped lift its reported sales.
