 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Top U.S. pork producer Smithfield Foods Inc. SFD.N reported a steeper-than-expected drop in quarterly earnings on Thursday, due to high feed prices and swine disease, and warned of rising costs, sending its shares lower. 

 The company, which is also a major beef producer and a partner in a large turkey operation, warned of higher meat prices ahead if prices for corn, an important feed, kept increasing. Smithfield, which has been rapidly buying other meat companies, said profit fell 13 percent to $44.7 million, or 40 cents per share, in the fiscal second quarter ended October 29, from $51.6 million, or 46 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts' average earnings forecast was 46 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Smithfield's quarterly revenue fell to $2.81 billion from $2.87 billion a year earlier. Shares of the Smithfield, Virginia-based company were down 56 cents, or 2.08 percent, at $26.40 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Meat companies this year have been hurt by an excess of meat and low prices, due in part to increased production and to lingering export disruptions from mad cow disease in late 2003 and bird flu overseas earlier this year. Two weeks ago, Tyson Foods Inc. ( TSN.N ), the nation's largest meat company, said an oversupply of meat was partly to blame for its quarterly loss. "Bottom line, Smithfield Foods is a stock we would like to recommend, but we continue to resist," John McMillin, food analyst with Prudential Equity Group, said in a research note. McMillin retains a "neutral" rating on Smithfield and expressed concern about high feed costs and a competitive meat environment, particularly with Smithfield's plan to build a beef plant in Oklahoma. JP Morgan analyst Pablo Zuanic called the quarterly results disappointing in a research report issued before a Smithfield conference call and had concerns about profitability on hogs. Smithfield raises about 14 million hogs a year, some of which are sold at market prices to its competitors. It is also part-owner of the nation's largest cattle-feeding operation. Higher corn prices plus hog losses due to the circovirus swine disease increased hog production costs to more than $41 per 100 pounds during the quarter from less than $40 a year earlier, the company said. "We are not going to keep these ... costs at $41; they are going up," Chief Executive Larry Pope said during the conference call with analysts. "They will be creeping up from here, but it's not going to be a runaway." Corn prices reached a 10-year high this fall due to increased demand from the growing ethanol industry. "Any significant cost increases will have to be passed through in selling prices relatively quickly to maintain margins," Pope said. A larger vaccine supply has helped the company control the circovirus in its East Coast hog operations, he said. Operating profit in the hog unit fell 26 percent to $76.3 million in the quarter and was the largest drag on earnings. Pork processing had an operating profit of $25.2 million, down from $26.6 million a year earlier. Smithfield's beef unit, which includes a joint venture cattle-feeding business, had an operating profit of $6 million, compared with a year-earlier loss of $4.3 million. Smithfield's results included some earnings from the former European meat operations of Sara Lee Corp. SLE.N, which a joint venture of Smithfield and OakTree Capital Management LLC acquired in August, and from the packaged meat unit acquired from ConAgra Foods Inc. ( CAG.N ) in October. The ConAgra deal included the Butterball turkey and Armor brands. Smithfield has grown its annual revenue to $11 billion, largely through acquisitions in the United States and abroad, either outright or with partners. Smithfield is in the process of buying smaller U.S. hog and pork producer Premium Standard Farms Inc. PORK.O. (Additional reporting by Christopher Kaufman in New York)
