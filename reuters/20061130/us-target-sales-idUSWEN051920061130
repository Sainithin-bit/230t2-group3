 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Target Corp. ( TGT.N ) said on Thursday that November sales rose 5.9 percent at stores open at least a year, helped by strong demand for electronics, health-care products and baby clothes. 

 Analysts, on average, expected the discount retailer to report a 5.8 percent increase, according to estimates gathered by Reuters. The company had forecast 4 percent to 7 percent growth. Total sales for the four-week period that ended on November 25 rose 11.7 percent to $5.12 billion. On a recorded message detailing its sales performance, Target reported an increase in both the number of shoppers and the average amount spent. Rival Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ), which posted its first monthly same-store sales decline in more than a decade, said its store traffic declined in November. Target said its inventory was in "very good" condition at the end of the period, and for December, it expects same-store sales growth in the range of 3.5 percent to 5.5 percent.
