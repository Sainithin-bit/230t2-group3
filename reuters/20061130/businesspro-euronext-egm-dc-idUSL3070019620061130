 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - European stock exchange operator 
Euronext ENXT.PA expects that shareholders will vote in 
support of its merger plan with NYSE Group NYX.N, board 
member Olivier Lefebvre said on Thursday. 

  He said invitations would be sent out today inviting 
shareholders to an extraordinary general meeting to vote on the 
deal on December 19.  "We do not expect the shareholders to walk away," said 
Lefebvre, speaking at the sidelines of a clearing and 
settlement industry conference in Brussels.  "We are very confident all the conditions are there to make 
this deal successful. Things should go as scheduled."  Lefebvre added that investor concerns that draconian U.S. 
regulation in the shape of Sarbanes-Oxley may eventually spill 
over into Europe had been covered. He said the deal was 
"fine-tuned" enough to meet any concerns.  "I think the regulatory concerns should be entirely 
covered," he said.  On Monday French Finance Minister Thierry Breton said 
Euronext and NYSE, the operator of the New York Stock Exchange, 
must continue to talk to the users of its trading platforms to 
ensure the proposed alliance meets their needs.
