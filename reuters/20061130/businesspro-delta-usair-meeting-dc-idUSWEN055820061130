 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - US Airways Group Inc. ( LCC.N ) said on 
Thursday it made a presentation to the management of bankrupt 
Delta Air Lines Inc. DALRQ.PK and its creditor committee on 
its $8.5 billion offer to buy Delta. 

  "We reviewed our offer and had a chance to engage in 
discussions on the many facets of this proposal," said US 
Airways Chief Executive Doug Parker, in statement. "We are 
confident that our proposal for a 'New' Delta will create more 
value than a stand-alone plan."  Delta, which received the takeover offer on November 15, 
has said that it intends to emerge from bankruptcy as a 
stand-alone carrier some time in the first half of next year.
