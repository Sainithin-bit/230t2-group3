 LONDON  (Reuters) - Sterling punched to a 14-year high against a broadly weaker dollar on Thursday, while expectations that world growth will stay strong despite a slower U.S. economy lifted global stock indexes to fresh record highs. 

 Euro zone government bonds stalled as markets absorbed a deluge of economic data, and oil traded near its highest level in two months above $62 a barrel after data showed shrinking U.S. fuel inventories. Sterling rose to $1.9563, its highest against the dollar since September 1992, when the UK was forced to abandon the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, the precursor to the euro. The euro rose above $1.32, testing a 20-month high against the dollar, which was also down against the yen at 116.26 at 1105 GMT. The dollar has fallen nearly 3 percent against a basket of major currencies in the past two weeks as softer U.S. data led markets to increase the odds of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates early next year to revive the economy. "We have had a range break, and investors weren't fully positioned for it," said Michael Metcalfe, senior strategist at State Street. "Investors are following the dollar decline, and the U.S. data seems to be supporting them." PASSING THE BATON Although some data from the world's largest economy has surprised on the downside, some analysts have taken a sanguine view based on expectations that other regions will pick up the baton of growth from the United States. Data on Thursday largely supported that view. German unemployment fell below 4 million for the first time in four years, Japanese manufacturers' confidence remained firm, India's economy grew by a faster-than-expected 9.2 percent in the third quarter and euro zone consumers grew more upbeat. The picture was not universally rosy, with German retail sales surprising on the downside and French consumer confidence unexpectedly falling, but analysts said the data backed the argument that Europe and Asia could decouple from a slowing United States. "This is a message of strong growth again in the fourth quarter, and that the economic recovery is becoming more sustainable," Kenneth Broux, an economist at Lloyds TSB, said of the European data. STOCKS RISE Equity investors agreed, pushing the MSCI All-Country World Index to a fresh record high of 360 points. Asian markets led the gains, with Tokyo's Nikkei average rising 1.2 percent to close back in positive territory for 2006 at 16,274 points. European stocks underperformed on concerns about strong currencies hurting exports. The FTSEurofirst 300 edged up 0.2 percent to 1,445.7 points, with miners among the biggest gainers after a rise in commodity prices. The index is up 13 percent this year and up 40 percent in the past two years, but markets are still seen as reasonable value given huge improvements in profits in recent years. "Our central view is a global soft landing, with the Fed easing next year," said Keith Wade, chief economist and member of the asset allocation team at fund manager Schroders. "In the past that has been a pretty good backdrop for markets. We do require a bit of a re-rating in equities to get returns into double-digits because we do think earning will slow. But looking at current valuations, I don't think that's too unreasonable." Heavyweight energy stocks such as Italy's Eni rose as U.S. light crude gained to $62.65, helped by data on Wednesday showing U.S. stockpiles of fuel shrank last week. Government bonds were mixed as markets absorbed the flood of data and comments from a number of central bankers. The December Bund future was unchanged at 118.21, while the U.S. 10 year Treasury notes was yielding 4.505 percent.
