 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - J.C. Penney Co Inc. ( JCP.N ) said on Thursday its November sales at department stores open at least a year rose a less-than-expected 1.4 percent, but it stood by its earnings forecast for the fourth quarter. 

 Analysts, on average, had been expecting a same-store sales increase of 4 percent, according to a Reuters survey. The company itself had forecast a low-single-digit increase. The Plano, Texas-based company said total department store sales rose 3.3 percent to $1.6 billion in the four weeks ended November 25, while catalog and Internet sales were down 0.3 percent to $290 million. On a recorded call, J.C. Penney said traffic trends in its stores were positive on "Black Friday," the day after Thanksgiving, but slowed on Saturday. It also said that Christmas is on a Monday this year, which "may pressure sales leading up to the last weekend." For December, it forecast same department store sales to increase in the low single digits. In last year's December period, its same department store sales rose 2.2 percent. Penney also said it still expects fourth-quarter earnings per share of $1.94. Analysts, on average, are expecting $1.97 per share for that quarter, according to Reuters Estimates.
