 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The number of U.S. workers applying 
for jobless benefits rose a higher-than-expected 34,000 to a 
seasonally adjusted 357,000, according to a government report 
on Thursday. 

  The latest figures from the Labor Department cover the week 
ending November 25. Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted 
claims would edge down to 314,000.  Claims in the prior week were revised slightly to 323,000 
from the prior estimate of 321,000.  The Thanksgiving holiday contributed to the relatively big 
rise in seasonally adjusted claims because actual claims fell 
less than anticipated by statistical factors, a Labor 
Department official said.  The four-week moving average, considered a more reliable 
measure of underlying employment trends because it irons out 
such weekly fluctuations, edged up to 325,000 from 317,750.  The number of people drawing continuing jobless benefits 
gained 45,000 to 2.48 million in the week ended November 18, 
higher than the 2.45 million continuing claims analysts were 
expecting.
