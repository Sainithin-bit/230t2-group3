 NEW YORK/LONDON  (Reuters) - Gold jumped above $640 to a 16-week high in New York trading on Thursday, as the dollar fell further against major currencies, prompting funds to buy precious metals. 

 Silver hit a new six-month high as metals also got a boost from a rise in oil prices to above $63 a barrel, the strongest in two months. Spot gold XAU= was last quoted at $647.40/648.40 an ounce by 3:46 p.m. in New York (2046 GMT), up sharply from $635.70/636.70 an ounce late Wednesday. During the session it hit a high of $648.40, its highest since mid-August. Gold had struggled to crack through the $640 level several times since early September, but the ailing dollar finally gave the market fresh impetus. "It's the weaker dollar, firmer oil and the market has been looking for an excuse to move through $640," said Peter Hillyard, head of metals sales at ANZ Investment Bank. "The view of the market was that anywhere between $640 and $649 would be like plowing through treacle, but it seems to have got through it much quicker than people thought." He said that many in the market were looking for gold to target $660 before Christmas. "Some think it may even go to $700. Why? Because they think the dollar is going to hell." The dollar slid to 14-year troughs against sterling and a 20-month low versus the euro, extending a broad slide amid worries about a slowdown in the U.S. economy and the possibility that the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates. Lower U.S. interest rates lessen the opportunity cost to investors of holding zero-yielding gold. In New York, benchmark February gold at the COMEX division of the New York Mercantile Exchange GCG7 rose $11.10 to settle at $652.90 an ounce, near its intraday high of $654.50. "You are getting some investment-fund interest back in the market today again. It's positive pretty much across the board," said James Quinn, commodities commentator at AG Edwards. Quinn said sentiment in the precious metals market remained optimistic. "It doesn't look like the dollar is ready to move higher at this point." UPBEAT SILVER Silver XAG= set a six-month high of $13.96, and was last quoted at $13.95/13.98 an ounce from $13.53/13.60. Some traders said it could be aiming for $14.50, but the metal was prone to sharp fluctuations because the silver market was much smaller than that of gold. Analysts and traders found it difficult to identify any particular reason for silver's recent strength -- the metal has gained some 30 percent since early October, versus a 14 percent rise in gold. "I guess it was predominantly investor demand that pushed silver higher recently. There was also some industrial buying, but the investor buying was much stronger," one trader said. Lease rates charged for lending out the metal were also unmoved, indicating there is no short-term supply squeeze. Silver, used in jewelry, electronics and photography, hit a 25-year high of $15.17 in May as funds poured money into commodities amid worries about rising energy costs, tensions in the Middle East and uncertainties in the dollar's outlook. Platinum XPT= firmed to $1,175/1,180 an ounce from $1,150/1,160 late in New York. Palladium XPD= rose to $327/331 an ounce from $317/322.
