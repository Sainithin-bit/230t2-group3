 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The number of help-wanted ads in U.S. newspapers rose slightly in October, indicating labor demand remains cool as the year draws to an end, a private research group said on Thursday. 

 The Conference Board said its gauge measuring help-wanted ad volume in the United States was 30 in October, up one point from the downwardly revised September reading of 29. It was 37 a year ago. "The job market is responding to a cooling in the overall economic environment," said Ken Goldstein, labor economist at the Conference Board in a statement. "Business plans have become cautious -- on spending, on building inventory, and on hiring going forward," said Goldstein. Help-wanted ads declined in eight of the nine regions in the last three months, with the steepest decline in the East North Central region, the Conference Board said. The ads in that region fell 15.4 percent. Online want-ad volume increased 6 percent to 3.831 million in October, the Conference Board said. This was the first time the research group reported the total number of online ads posted during the month, said Gad Levanon, economist at the Conference Board. Previously, it reported only new online ads and the September figure was 2.46 million. The research firm surveys help-wanted ad volume at 51 newspapers across the country each month.
