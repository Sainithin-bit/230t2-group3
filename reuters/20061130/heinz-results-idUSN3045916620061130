  By  Brad Dorfman CHICAGO  Nov 30 (Reuters) - Ketchup maker H.J. Heinz Co.
HNZ.N on Thursday posted lower quarterly profit, hurt by a
higher tax rate, but raised its full-year earnings forecast
helped by sales of new products and cost cuts.  The maker of Heinz condiments, Ore-Ida frozen potatoes and
a host of other packaged foods also said profit in Europe rose
9.7 percent before one-time items as the company has cut costs
and sold off businesses to try to improve results in that
region.  The company, which in June announced a new plan to cut jobs
and increase spending on new products and marketing, said
profit fell to $191.6 million, or 57 cents a share, in the
fiscal second quarter ended Nov. 1, from $203.8 million, or 60
cents a share, a year earlier.  Its effective tax rate was 34.8 percent in the quarter,
compared with 23.8 percent a year earlier when the company
reversed a tax provision related to a foreign affiliate. Heinz
expects its tax rate from continuing operations to be 30
percent for the year.  Earnings from continuing operations were 59 cents a share.
Analysts on average forecast 60 cents a share, according to
Reuters Estimates.  The results follow a contentious battle in which activist
investor Nelson Peltz and his Trian Group won two seats on
Heinz's board of directors. Investors were looking to see
whether better-than-expected results posted for the first
quarter would continue.  "While the second quarter was not quite as impressive in
the first, sales and profits advanced in every division absent
the effect of the divestitures and currency," Christopher
Growe, analyst at A.G. Edwards, said in a research note.  Sales rose 3.5 percent to $2.23 billion, helped by higher
prices and the impact of the weaker dollar, which raises the
value of sales outside the United States when they are reported
in dollars on the company's income statement. Divestitures, net
of acquisitions, cut sales by 2.6 percent, the company said.  Volume, a measure of sales that eliminates price and
currency fluctuations, rose 3.5 percent, helped by sales of
frozen entrees and new products in Australia and New Zealand.  Sales rose 7.5 percent in the North American consumer
products segment, with volume up 4.7 percent.  Sales in Europe fell 0.8 percent, but were up 4.4 percent
excluding divestitures and acquisitions.  In the past year, Heinz has sold off some businesses in
Europe, including its seafood business. It also cut some prices
as it tries to improve results that have been hit by higher
costs and the growth of deep discount retailers.  Heinz said it now expects earnings of $2.35 to $2.39 a
share, from its previous forecast of $2.35 a share. Analysts on
average expected $2.34 a share, according to Reuters
Estimates.  Heinz shares were up 27 cents at $44.24 on Thursday on the
New York stock Exchange. The stock is up 31 percent this year,
boosted by both Peltz's interest in the company and improving
results.  Heading into Thursday, the stock traded at about 18.7 times
estimated 2007 earnings, compared with a multiple of 21.3 for
ConAgra Foods Inc. ( CAG.N ) and 21.1 for Sara Lee Corp. SLE.N,
two other packaged food companies that have been undergoing a
restructuring.
