 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Limited Brands Inc. ( LTD.N ) said on Thursday that November sales at stores open at least a year rose 12 percent, beating expectations, as its Victoria's Secret intimate apparel chain posted its best holiday kick-off ever. 

 "Victoria's Secret exceeded our expectations," said Amie Preston, Limited Brands vice president of investor relations, in a recorded statement. She added that a Black Friday promotion of giving a tote bag with purchase helped drive its best-ever post-Thanksgiving sales. Black Friday refers to the first Friday after the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday, which retailers use to jump-start holiday shopping with gifts, promotions and bargains. The use of 'black' connotes profit, as opposed to 'red' for loss. The company's Bath & Body Works stores also posted sharply higher sales as customers snapped up shower soaps and lotions as gift items. Analysts had expected a same-store sales gain of 8.2 percent for the four weeks that ended November 25, according to a Reuters survey. Net sales for the company, whose store chains also include Express, were up 15 percent at $937.7 million. All four major company business units reported higher sales. Victoria's Secret same-store sales rose 14 percent, while Limited sales edged up 1 percent. Bath & Body Works sales jumped 16 percent, and Express sales gained 7 percent. Looking ahead, the company expects December sales to rise in the high-single-digit percentage range. Shares of Limited Brands closed at $31.27 on Wednesday. The stock is up 40 percent so far this year as the company has posted steadily rising sales and earnings. In contrast, the Dow Jones U.S. retail index .DJUSRA is up 17 percent.
