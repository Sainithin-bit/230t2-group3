 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wine and spirits company Brown-Forman Corp. ( BFa.N ) ( BFb.N ) said on Thursday quarterly net profit rose, helped by an asset sale and strong sales of premium brands such as Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey. 

 But the company, whose class A shares fell 3.58 percent in late-afternoon trading, said its $876 million purchase of Mexico's premium tequila-maker Casa Herradura will lower its 2007 earnings by a range of 8 cents to 12 cents a share and will hurt profits through fiscal 2009. The Casa Herradura deal should close by the end of 2006, Chief Executive Paul Varga said on a conference call. The Louisville, Kentucky-based company, which owns Finlandia Vodka and Bolla Italian Wines, said net income increased to $123.8 million, or $1.00 per diluted share, in the fiscal second quarter from $108.8 million, or 88 cents per share, a year ago. Analysts, on average, were expecting 96 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Quarterly sales rose 10 percent to $735.3 million from $665.8 million a year earlier. "We continue to believe that Brown-Forman is a stand-out among our beverage universe and expect its favorable positioning will yield low-double digit earnings growth longer term," Goldman Sachs analyst Andrew Sawyer said in a research note. Brown-Forman is among the wine and spirits companies that have benefited as U.S. consumer tastes have shifted away from beer toward cocktails and wine. The company has been buying more spirits brands and is exploring the sale of its Hartmann Inc. unit, one of the oldest U.S. luggage makers. The liquor producer has owned Hartmann since 1983. Brown-Forman said its sale of an Italian winery boosted its quarterly profit by 8 cents a share. Excluding the impact from the Casa Herradura acquisition, Brown-Forman said it now expects full-year earnings of $3.14 and $3.30 per share. Brown-Forman stock trades at 19.85 times estimated 2007 earnings, compared with a multiple of 14.29 times for rival spirits company Fortune Brands Inc. FO.N. Brown-Forman class A shares fell $2.60 to $70.10 on the New York Stock Exchange. The class B shares slid $1.96, or 2.75 percent, to $69.39. The class A shares have fallen 13.2 percent from their 52-week high of $82.55 reached March 17, through Wednesday's close.
