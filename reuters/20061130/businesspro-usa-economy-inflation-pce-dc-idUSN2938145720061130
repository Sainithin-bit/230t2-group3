 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. incomes and spending rose in 
October, providing the means for consumers to keep spending as 
the holiday shopping season approached, while core consumer 
prices rose modestly, the government reported on Thursday. 

  Incomes rose 0.4 percent in October after a 0.5 percent 
rise in September while spending grew at a 0.2 percent rate 
after declining 0.2 percent in September. That was roughly in 
line with Wall Street economists' forecasts for a 0.5 percent 
rise in incomes and a 0.1 percent spending increase.  Core consumer prices, which exclude food and energy, rose 
0.2 percent in October, matching September's rise. On a 
year-over-year basis, core prices were up 2.4 percent, the same 
increase as in September.  Overall consumer prices rose 1.5 percent on a 
year-over-year basis, the smallest rise since a 1.4 percent 
gain in August 2002.
