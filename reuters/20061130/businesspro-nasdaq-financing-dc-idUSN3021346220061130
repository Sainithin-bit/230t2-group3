 LONDON  (Reuters) - Nasdaq Stock Market Inc. ( NDAQ.O ) has 
left the door open in its financing terms to just buy a 
controlling stake in the London Stock Exchange ( LSE.L ), instead 
of buying all outstanding shares, a source close to the matter 
said. 

  Nasdaq on November 20 offered to buy all outstanding shares 
of the LSE, in a deal valuing the latter at 2.7 billion pounds 
($5.3 billion). The LSE rejected the offer as inadequate.  If holders of about 61.25 percent of the London exchange's 
shares sell, Nasdaq will own a total of 90 percent of the LSE, 
and can take complete ownership and delist the exchange.  But the U.S. exchange's financing terms allow the company 
to borrow money as long as about another 21.35 percent of LSE 
shareholders sell their shares to Nasdaq and give the U.S. 
exchange a total stake of 50.1 percent, enough to control the 
exchange, the source said.  Nasdaq, which already owns about 28.75 percent of LSE, 
declined to comment.  Nasdaq said on Monday it has secured up to $5.1 billion of 
debt financing and $775 million of equity financing to fund its 
bid for the remaining shares of the London Stock Exchange.  The new borrowings would also refinance existing Nasdaq 
debt and cover various other costs linked to Nasdaq's offer to 
buy the remaining outstanding LSE shares from investors.  Nasdaq's bid for LSE shares comes as stock exchanges 
globally are consolidating and customers are pushing for lower 
fees and broader offerings.
