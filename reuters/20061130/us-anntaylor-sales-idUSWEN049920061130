 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - AnnTaylor Stores Corp. ( ANN.N ) said on Thursday its sales at stores open at least a year fell 4.3 percent in November as unusually warm weather hurt sales of winter clothing. 

 Analysts, on average, had been expecting the New York-based women's clothing retailer to post a same-stores sales decrease of 1.7 percent, according to a Reuters survey. The operator of the Ann Taylor and Ann Taylor Loft apparel chains said net sales for the four-week period ended November 25 increased 2.1 percent to $186.4 million.
