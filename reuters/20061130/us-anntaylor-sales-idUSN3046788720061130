 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - AnnTaylor Stores Corp. ( ANN.N ) said on Thursday its sales at stores open at least a year fell a worse-than-expected 4.3 percent in November as unusually warm weather hurt demand for winter clothing. 

 "November got off to a slow start, particularly in the context of the very strong November we reported last year," Kay Krill, president and chief executive, said in a statement. "As expected, the unusually warm weather in much of the country negatively impacted results in weather-sensitive categories such as sweaters, outerwear and cold weather accessories at both Ann Taylor and Loft." Analysts, on average, expected the New York-based women's clothing retailer to post a same-stores sales decrease of 1.7 percent, according to a Reuters survey. Broken down by division, November sales for the Ann Taylor division dropped to $73.3 million from $76.2 million in the year-ago period, while Loft sales rose to $86.2 million from $86.1 million. Net sales increased 2.1 percent to $186.4 million for the four-week period ended November 25. The company said sales picked up in the latter half of the month, and both divisions posted strong sales due to holiday promotions following the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday. Shares of AnnTaylor closed at $34.44 Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange.
