 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Pier 1 Imports Inc. ( PIR.N ) on Thursday 
said November sales had fallen 15.3 percent at its stores open 
at least a year, more sharply than expected, as aggressive 
advertising and discounts failed to attract more shoppers. 

  The struggling home decor retailer, which has posted 10 
consecutive months of declining same-store sales, also said 
holiday merchandise was selling well.  Analysts on average expected a November same-store sales 
decline of 12.2 percent, according to estimates gathered by 
Reuters.  Total sales for the four weeks ended on November 25 fell 
14.7 percent to $144.3 million.  Pier 1 has suffered as discount stores and specialty 
retailers stepped up the competition.  The company has revamped its merchandise and increased 
advertising, but sales have remained sluggish. Pier 1 said 
earlier this month that it was mailing catalogs to 15 million 
customers in November.  "Despite aggressive marketing and promotional efforts in 
November, our sales results in the home furnishings categories 
remain weak," Chief Executive Marvin Girouard said in a 
statement.  "Holiday merchandise is selling well," he added, "and we 
expect to successfully manage overall inventories to insure 
that levels stay on plan."  Pier 1 shares are up 12 percent over the past three months 
amid takeover speculation, but they remain down nearly 25 
percent for the year to date. They closed at $6.80 on the New 
York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.
