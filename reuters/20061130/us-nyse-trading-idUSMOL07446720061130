 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The New York Stock Exchange said on Thursday that an electronic system for handling orders on its trading floor is now fully operational after going down this morning. 

 The four-hour downtime had forced some brokers to handle trades on paper, while some orders that were in the system when it went down were delayed, said a floor trader, but he added that they could be reclaimed and fully executed. "At approximately 2:15 p.m. (1915 GMT) today, the NYSE fully resolved technical issues related to the NYSE Broker Booth Support System that began at approximately 10:06 a.m. Currently, all NYSE proprietary BBSS systems are now fully operational," the exchange said in a release. NYSE spokesman Rich Adamonis said the any impacted orders were processed manually or electronically. All orders routed electronically through the NYSE's CMS and SuperDot trading systems as well as the Hybrid Market order routing systems are unaffected. Brokers were filling orders with paper forms since the BBS system is used to transmit orders between brokers' handheld devices and trading booths.
