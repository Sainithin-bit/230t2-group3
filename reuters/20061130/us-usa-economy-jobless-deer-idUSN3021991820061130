 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The number of U.S. workers seeking an initial week of jobless aid was the highest in more than a year last week, but the data was likely skewed by the Thanksgiving holiday -- and Wisconsin deer hunters. 

 The 34,000 jump in new applications for state unemployment aid was the largest since September of last year, shortly after Hurricane Katrina hit the U.S Gulf Coast, the U.S. Labor Department said on Thursday. Analysts were quick to say difficulties adjusting the data for seasonal changes around the one-day Thanksgiving holiday were at play. But another factor -- deer -- could have fueled some of the gain as well. Included in the count were 23,000 newly idled workers from Wisconsin, where many employers closed their doors for the entire week of Thanksgiving, setting workers free to take part in the state's nine-day deer hunting season. "We traditionally -- and we have for years and years and years -- have a spike in (claims) that week," said Rose Lynch, communications director for the state's Department of Workforce Development. "Many factories and plants throughout Wisconsin close down for the week." The state's traditional week-long shutdown period dates back to much older times, when it was difficult to heat facilities and employers were loath to close for just a day, she said. Since Thanksgiving coincided with deer hunting season, many employers were happy to shut for the entire week. Lynch said the state's traditional spike in claims is far from a signal of economic weakness. "Our claims our going down, our economy is improving, but still that is a week that will show a spike no matter what the economy is doing," she said. Analysts always caution against reading too much into one week's figures, and they say that caveat is particularly important from Thanksgiving to the end of January, when holiday-shortened weeks and bad weather can distort the data.
