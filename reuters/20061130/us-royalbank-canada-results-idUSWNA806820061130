 TORONTO  (Reuters) - Royal Bank of Canada ( RY.TO ) said on Thursday its fourth-quarter profit rose 142 percent, driven by stronger revenue growth in its wealth management and banking businesses. 

 Royal, the country's largest bank, said net income was C$1.26 billion ($1.11 billion), or 96 Canadian cents a share, in the three months ended October 31. That compares with C$522 million, or 39 Canadian cents, in the same period a year earlier, when it set aside large reserves for Enron litigation and for losses resulting from U.S. hurricanes. Excluding the prior year Enron provision, net income increased C$414 million, or 49 percent. Earnings from operations were C$1.26 billion, or 96 Canadian cents a share, up 133 percent from the year earlier period. Analysts had forecast quarterly earnings of 90 Canadian cents a share before exceptional items, according to data compiled by Reuters Estimates. A year ago, Royal's bottom line was hurt by a C$591 million pretax reserve for Enron litigation, and C$203 million in reserves for estimated claims from hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma. In the latest quarter, return on equity, a key measure of profitability, was 23.9 percent. Within its main business lines, fourth-quarter net income at the Canadian personal and business banking segment rose 54 percent. Profit at the international personal and business banking unit dropped 5 percent. RBC Capital Markets profit gained 17 percent, excluding the Enron provision. For the full year, Royal said net income rose 40 percent, to C$4.73 billion. ($1=$1.14 Canadian)
