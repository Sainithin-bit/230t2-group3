 LONDON  (Reuters) - British retail sales volumes fell for a second month running in November and to the weakest level since March, a survey showed on Thursday. 

 The Confederation of British Industry's distributive trades survey's reported sales balance fell to -9 in November from -4 in October. Analysts had forecast a pick-up to +5. "The survey shows a negative balance for retail sales growth ... which is clearly disappointing," said John Longworth, executive director of Asda and chairman of the survey panel. "But retailers are still looking forward to healthy sales growth during the busy Christmas period," he said. The quarterly business situation balance fell to -1 from +10 in August, while the quarterly reported selling prices edged up to +13, the highest reading in more than two years. The CBI survey was conducted between October 31 and November 15. Sterling was little moved versus the dollar  GBP= , having ticked down from 14-year peaks prior to data release. A breakdown by sector showed durable household goods sales bucked the trend and grew strongly last month, probably reflecting buoyancy in the housing market. Sales of clothing and footwear fell sharply, however, as unusually mild weather hit winter lines. A separate survey on Thursday showed British consumer confidence unexpectedly fell in November after the Bank of England raised interest rates to 5 percent. Research company GFK NOP's monthly consumer confidence index fell to -7 from -5 in October, as the rate rise soured the public's mood about their personal finances and the wider economy. Speaking to a parliamentary committee, Bank of England Deputy Governor John Gieve saw little evidence of a serious consumer slowdown. "I don't see much evidence yet that the consumer is reining back," he said. Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at Global Insight, said the survey was "deeply disappointing" and said consumers remained highly sensitive to prices. "There is clear evidence that consumers are price conscious and prone to curb their spending if they suspect they are not getting a good deal," he said." "We suspect that many shoppers will look around for the best prices between now and Christmas, and will be prepared to at least delay purchases if they are not satisfied with what is on offer."
