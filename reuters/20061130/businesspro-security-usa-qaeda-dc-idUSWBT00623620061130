 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. government has warned U.S. 
private financial services of an al Qaeda call for a cyber 
attack against U.S. online stock trading and banking Web sites 
beginning Friday, officials said on Thursday. 

  The officials -- a person familiar with the warning and a 
spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security -- said the 
Islamic militant group aimed to penetrate and destroy the 
databases of the U.S. stock market and banking Web sites.  Homeland Security said it had no evidence to corroborate 
the threat but had issued the warning out of an "abundance of 
caution." The department said in a statement that the threat 
was for all of December.  "There is no information to corroborate this aspirational 
threat. As a routine matter and out of an abundance of caution, 
US-CERT issued the situational awareness report to industry 
stakeholders," said Homeland Security spokesman Russ Knocke.  US-CERT is the U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team. The 
U.S. government said the threat was to avenge the holding of 
suspected terrorists at the U.S. prison in Guantanamo.
