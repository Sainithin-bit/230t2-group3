 CHICAGO  Nov 30 (Reuters) - Del Monte Foods Co. DLM.N
reported a 47 percent decline in quarterly profit on Thursday
as it was hit by higher costs for fish, peaches and tomatoes as
well as expenses for integrating acquisitions.  But earnings excluding one-time items exceeded
expectations, helped by price increases and cost cuts, and the
stock rose about 1 percent.  The maker of canned fruit, StarKist tuna and Meow Mix cat
food posted a profit of $23.2 million, or 11 cents a share for
the fiscal second quarter, ended Oct. 29, down from $43.9
million, or 22 cents a share a year earlier.  Excluding one-time items such as acquisition integration
costs, earnings were 18 cents a share, unchanged from a year
earlier and 4 cents better than the average forecast of
analysts polled by Reuters Estimates.  Sales rose 12.6 percent to $893.5 million.  The company said it now expects sales to increase 12
percent to 15 percent for the year, compared with a previous
forecast of 14 percent to 16 percent.  Del Monte said it still expects earnings from continuing
operations of 48 cents to 53 cents a share for the year.  The company's pet food business, which includes recently
acquired Meow Mix and Milk Bone dog snacks, had a 56.6 percent
increase in sales and a 65.2 percent increase in operating
income, helped by the acquisitions.  Consumer product sales fell 3.1 percent, as higher prices
across the tuna category reduced the amount of tuna sold by
more than expected.  Operating profit in that segment fell 17.4 percent.  Del Monte shares rose 4 cents to $11.22 at midday on
Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange.
