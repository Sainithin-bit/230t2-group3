 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. incomes grew steadily in October and spending rebounded, the government said on Thursday, but a Midwest business barometer showing a November slump raised doubts about the economy's direction. 

 The Commerce Department said personal income rose 0.4 percent after a 0.5 percent September rise while spending was up 0.2 percent after contracting 0.2 percent a month earlier. The income and spending report was one in a series including higher new claims for jobless benefits last week and a drop in the National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago business barometer index to 49.9 from 53.5 in October. It was the first time in 3-1/2 years the index dipped below 50, a level that marks the break-even point between expansion and contraction in business activity. Orders and hiring both weakened last month. Stock prices seesawed but ended little changed. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 4.80 points, or 0.04 percent, to end at 12,221.93 while the Nasdaq composite index fell less than 1 point to 2,431.77. In contrast, prices for debt securities posted solid gains on hope that slowing economic activity raised chances the Federal Reserve might cut interest rates next year. Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR rose 14/32 in price for a yield of 4.47 percent, the lowest since late January, from 4.52 percent late on Wednesday. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond US30YT=RR rose 26/32 in price to yield 4.57 percent. The Fed raised interest rates steadily for two years before pausing in August and has left them unchanged at two more meetings since then. But there were signs inflation pressures remain. The Commerce Department report showed so-called core consumer prices -- which exclude food and energy items -- rose 0.2 percent in each of September and October and on a year-over-year basis were 2.4 percent higher in each month. NOT COMFORTABLE That means core inflation is above a presumed Fed "comfort zone" around 2 percent and underlines Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke's remark in New York on Tuesday that the core rate is "uncomfortably high" in the view of policy-makers. Fed policy-makers closely monitor core prices. The broader personal consumption expenditures index including food and energy was up 1.5 percent on a year-over-year basis in October, its smallest rise since a 1.4 percent gain in August 2002. Analysts said the Fed likely will again keep rates steady at its next policy-setting session on December 12 while it gauges how much strain the economy faces and decides whether its next rate move will be up or down. "The economy is moving ahead, but inflation still really is higher than the Fed's stated target," said Andrew Richman, managing director of SunTrust's personal asset management division in West Palm Beach, Florida. "I think the Fed will not take any action for a while." Separately, the Labor Department said new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly jumped 34,000 to a seasonally adjusted 357,000 last week -- a surprise since Wall Street analysts had forecast they would ease to 314,000. BENEFIT CLAIMS RISING Analysts said the claims data might have been distorted by last week's Thanksgiving Day holiday, though they noted it would not be surprising if claims went up as new home building and sales soften. "You shouldn't be surprised to see some deterioration in claims, picking up perhaps due to layoffs in the housing and mortgage industries," said Mark Vitner, senior economist with Wachovia Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. There was fresh evidence on Thursday that U.S. housing prices were no longer accelerating as fast as they have in recent years when they were providing a boost to spending. The U.S. Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight said home prices edged up 0.86 percent from the second to the third quarter, or at an annual rate of 3.45 percent. That was the lowest quarterly rise since the second quarter of 1998. In the 12 months to September 30, average house prices were up 7.73 percent but that was only slightly more than half the peak 13.9 percent appreciation posted in the spring of 2004. Despite rising incomes, early reports were that holiday sales got off to a less-than-stellar start in November. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ), the world's largest retailer, said sales at its U.S. stores open at least a year fell 0.1 percent from November 2005, the first decline since April 1996. Wal-Mart also said same-store sales should be flat to up 1 percent in December, which analysts said was disappointing. The holiday period from Thanksgiving to Christmas is vital for retailers, some of whom count on the seasonal shopping spree to generate as much as half of their annual business.
