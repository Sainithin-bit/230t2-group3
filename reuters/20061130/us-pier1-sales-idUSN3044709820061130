 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Pier 1 Imports Inc. ( PIR.N ) on Thursday said November sales fell 15.3 percent at its stores open at least a year, more sharply than expected, as aggressive advertising and discounts failed to attract more shoppers. 

 The struggling home decor retailer, which has posted 10 consecutive months of declining same-store sales, said, however, that holiday merchandise was selling well. Analysts on average had expected a November same-store sales decline of 12.2 percent, according to estimates gathered by Reuters. Total sales for the four weeks ended on November 25 fell 14.7 percent to $144.3 million. "If sales continue to deteriorate, the company could face liquidity issues down the road," Sanford C. Bernstein, analyst Colin McGranahan, said in a research note. But since the continued decline was largely expected, the stock should change little on the news, McGranahan said. Pier 1, which has posted losses in six consecutive quarters, has suffered from a cooling U.S. housing market and increased competition from specialty retailers and discounters like Target Corp. ( TGT.N ). The company has revamped its merchandise and increased advertising, but sales have remained sluggish. Pier 1 said earlier this month that it was mailing catalogs to 15 million customers in November. The catalog initiative has been ineffective, with any sales being largely promotional, said Lehman Brothers analyst Alan Rifkin, who has an "underweight" rating on Pier 1 stock. "We continue to believe numerous merchandise (and) marketing initiatives are not gaining traction, alienating the once loyal Pier 1 customer," Rifkin said in a research note. In order to boost sales for the crucial holiday shopping season, Pier 1 said it would increase inventories of decorative accessories, gifts and tabletop collections. Yet store traffic in November remained down an estimated 10 to 11 percent, Rifkin said. "Despite aggressive marketing and promotional efforts in November, our sales results in the home furnishings categories remain weak," Chief Executive Marvin Girouard said in a statement. "Holiday merchandise is selling well," he added, "and we expect to successfully manage overall inventories to insure that levels stay on plan." Pier 1 shares are up 12 percent over the past three months amid takeover speculation, but they remain down nearly 25 percent for the year to date. They closed at $6.80 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.
