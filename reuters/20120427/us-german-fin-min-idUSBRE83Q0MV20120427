 BERLIN  (Reuters) - German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said in an interview to be broadcast later on Friday that Standard & Poor's downgrade of Spain's sovereign debt makes an already critical situation for that country "even more critical". 
 Schaeuble was also quoted as telling Germany's WDR radio, in a brief preview of an interview to be aired in full at 1730 GMT, that Spain's situation had not deteriorated in objective terms. (Reporting by  Stephen Brown )
