 MADRID  (Reuters) - Spanish bailed out lender Bankia will sell its business in Miami, Chairman Jose Ignacio Goirigolzarri said on Wednesday. 
 The lender plans to shrink some activities as part of a restructuring plan, slash its workforce and bank branches and shed 50 billion euros ($65 billion) of assets. Bankia is one of several Spanish banks due to receive European aid. (Reporting by Jesus Aguado, writing by Sarah White, editing by Tracy Rucinski)
