 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Greece's debt buy back will be voluntary and must succeed, the country's Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras said on Wednesday but declined to give details. 
 Euro zone finance ministers and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) agreed earlier this week to conduct the buy back by mid-December, as part of measures to make Greece's debt sustainable. (Reporting by Lefteris Papadimas)
