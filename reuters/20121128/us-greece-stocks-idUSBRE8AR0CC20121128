 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Greece's bank stocks dropped on Wednesday for a second consecutive day on concerns that a Greek debt buyback plan as part of the country's international bailout might hit their capital. 
 The banking stock index was down 5.1 percent at 0404 EDT, extending a 9.8 percent loss in the session on Tuesday. "There is uncertainty about the terms of the debt buyback program. If banks participate to a high degree, their future bond income might suffer," said Natasha Roumantzi, an analyst at Piraeus Securities. (Reporting by Maria Paravantes, writing by Harry Papachristou)
