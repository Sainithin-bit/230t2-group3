 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - The U.S. economy will not slide into a double dip and inflation risks linger in the medium term, St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard said on Tuesday. 

 Bullard was speaking during a panel discussion after an earlier speech in which he said a strong global recovery was underway and being led by Asia. Bullard is a voting member in 2010 of the Federal Open Market Committee, the policy-setting panel of the central bank. (Reporting by Saikat Chatterjee; Editing by Chris Lewis)
