 LAS VEGAS  (Reuters) - Retailers strive for the perfect mix of products that will boost sales and keep costs down -- but the experience of some, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ), in pruning merchandise shows that getting the recipe just right, can be tricky business. 

 More than 40 percent of retailers reduced the number of different items, or SKUs, on their shelves in 2009 and nearly the same number expect to make additional cuts, according to a survey released by the Nielsen Co on Tuesday. Limiting the product assortment can help retailers cut costs, but the risk is that shoppers will take their money elsewhere if they don't find what they are looking for. "The message to retailers is to choose carefully when it comes to deciding which products to trim," Stuart Taylor, Nielsen's vice president of custom analytics, said at the market research firm's Consumer 360 conference in Las Vegas. According to Nielsen, 7 percent of shoppers who did not find the personal-care item they were looking for said they would leave a store without buying an item in the category. More importantly, some shoppers said they would leave without buying at all. If just 0.5 percent of grocery shoppers were to leave a store without making a purchase, the lost sales would equal as much as $1.5 billion, according to Nielsen, which sells products and services to help retailers finesse assortment. Grocers ranging from Walmart to Kroger Co ( KR.N ) are locked in a fierce battle to offer the lowest prices and choosing the right assortment carries high stakes. Walmart is the highest-profile retailer to have felt the pinch after taking the wrong items off its shelves. When it reported fourth-quarter results in February, Walmart said its program to overhaul stores hurt sales as shoppers adjusted to new store layouts and product selections. The world's biggest retailer, which last year got almost half of its U.S. sales from the grocery category, removed slower-selling items and replaced them with faster-selling or more popular products as part of a store remodeling program. In March, Walmart said it put roughly 300 items back on U.S. store shelves after executives said the retailer "disappointed" customers by not stocking certain products. The company found that not stocking particular sizes or flavors of food sent some shoppers -- with their cash -- elsewhere, even if the missing item was a one-pound bag of brown rice.
