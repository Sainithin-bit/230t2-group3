 (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke told Congress on Wednesday the U.S. central bank was prepared to take further steps to bolster economic growth if needed. 

 In answer to a question from a member of the Senate Banking Committee, Bernanke briefly outlined steps the Fed could take. He said the central bank could bolster its language committing to hold interest rates low for an extended period, lower the rate it pays on the reserves banks hold at the Fed and either stop letting securities run off of its balance sheet or make additional asset purchases. Bernanke said all the options had drawbacks and would need to be evaluated carefully, adding that the central bank was not at a point where it could say what the leading options were. "We still have options, but they are not going to be conventional options, so we need to look at them carefully and make sure we are comfortable with any step that we take," he said. Below is a look at ways the Fed could try to stimulate the economy further with interest rates already near zero. HOLD MORTGAGE-RELATED ASSET LEVELS STEADY ON BALANCE SHEET To ease the 2007-2009 financial crisis, the Fed bought about $1.3 trillion in mortgage-backed securities and debt issued by government-sponsored mortgage finance enterprises to lower mortgage rates, stimulate home buying and push additional credit into the economy for banks to lend. It has stopped purchases and is letting the portfolio diminish as securities mature or are prepaid. It could instead resume buying these securities to maintain a steady level of ownership. This approach would likely yield its greatest impact upon being announced, signaling Fed angst about the recovery. But it may not produce much of an effect on housing markets with mortgage interest rates already at rock-bottom. BUY MORE ASSETS The Fed could buy more mortgage-backed securities, or since its holdings of MBS are already so large, it could buy more long-term Treasury securities. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said recently that further purchases of long-term Treasuries would be the most likely path if the economy took a decisive turn for the worse. Moving to buy more assets only months after declaring its buying spree over would be a risky flip-flop for the Fed, which tries to be as steady and predictable as possible. Dallas Fed chief Richard Fisher has voiced concerns such a move could dent the central bank's credibility. Buying Treasuries could raise questions about whether the Fed is simply printing money to finance the massive U.S. budget deficit and debt, which could undermine confidence in the dollar and drive interest rates higher. DEEPEN ITS COMMITMENT TO HOLD RATES LOW FOR LONG TIME Since March 2009, the Fed has said it anticipates that economic conditions are likely to warrant "exceptionally low" borrowing costs for "an extended period." It has specified that those conditions include high unemployment, subdued inflation trends and stable inflation expectations. The Fed could rephrase that promise to provide additional guarantees to markets of rock-bottom rates even when the recovery begins to take off. However, Bernanke might find it hard to garner support for such a move. A number of Fed officials have expressed concerns that the low-rate pledge could hinder the central bank from acting quickly if needed. STOP PAYING INTEREST ON EXCESS RESERVES The Fed could try to spark more lending by cutting the interest rate it pays banks on reserves they hold at the central bank from the current 0.25 percent. This would only be effective if there was unsated loan demand, which some doubt. OPEN A NEW LENDING FACILITY The Fed could open or keep open a lending facility to increase credit availability for any sector of the economy it wants to help, such as commercial real estate. The Fed would have to argue that crisis conditions exist in order to lend to non-banks, and may be shy about doing so after similar actions were criticized during the 2007-2009 financial crisis.
