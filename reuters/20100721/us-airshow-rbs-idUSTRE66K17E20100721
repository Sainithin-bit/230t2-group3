 LONDON  (Reuters) - British lender Royal Bank of Scotland confirmed it had placed an order worth over $7.6 billion at list prices for 52 Airbus A320 family aircraft and 43 Boeing 737 family aircraft. 

 The order was placed by RBS's aircraft-leasing unit RBS Aviation Capital. "The 95 aircraft will be delivered between now and 2015 and will be leased to RBS Aviation Capital's airline customers across the world, with all of the 2010 deliveries having already been placed," RBS said on Wednesday. Plane buyers often ask not to be identified when placing orders with Airbus and Boeing, preferring to wait for a big air show to make their deals public. Orders from lessors have been a key feature of the Farnborough Airshow. RBS shares were up 2.1 percent in early trading in a firm market. (Reporting by  Steve Slater ; Editing by Dan Lalor)
