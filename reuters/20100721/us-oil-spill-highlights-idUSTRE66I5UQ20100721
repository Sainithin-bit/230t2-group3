 (Reuters) - Here are some developments in BP Plc's Gulf of Mexico oil spill, the largest in U.S. history. 

 TOP DEVELOPMENTS * Energy giant BP Plc can extend a test on its capped Macondo oil well in the Gulf of Mexico after determining that nearby seepage is not related to the test, a U.S. official said on Monday. * David Cameron hopes his first trip to Washington as British prime minister will showcase a flourishing friendship with President Barack Obama, but it may be overshadowed by U.S. concerns over BP. POLITICS/POLICY * The British government said it had no plans to re-examine a prisoner transfer agreement with Libya after oil company BP confirmed it had lobbied its predecessor on the issue. * The U.S. Interior Department issued its first shallow-water drilling permit since offshore exploration companies were required to meet two sets of new safety regulations in response to the oil spill, a department official said on Monday. * Republicans "are happy" to consider legislation tied to the BP oil spill, but will not support a U.S. energy bill that includes climate regulations, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Sunday. * Fishermen in Mississippi say they are angry that under the terms of BP's $20 billion oil spill fund, money they earn doing clean-up will be subtracted from their claim against the company. MARKET IMPACT/COMPANIES * Marathon Oil Corp's start of oil production from a deepwater well in the Gulf of Mexico is the first since the U.S. government halted drilling after the massive BP spill, officials said Monday. * Shareholders angry about BP Plc's battered stock price are heading to the courthouse in hopes of reclaiming some of their losses but they face an uphill battle. * BP said it had spent $3.95 billion so far on efforts to tackle its leaking oil well and that it aims to permanently kill the well in the first half of August. * BP shares closed down 4.74 percent in London and shares in New York closed down 3.64 percent on Monday. CAPTURE/CONTAINMENT/CLEANUP * A Taiwanese-owned "super skimmer" sent to help clean up the Gulf of Mexico oil spill has been a bust, the U.S. Coast Guard said after tests on the ship. * Dozens of endangered sea turtle eggs have been moved to Florida's Atlantic coast to protect them from the oil spill, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said on Friday.
