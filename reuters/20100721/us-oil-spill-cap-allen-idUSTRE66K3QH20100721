 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - BP Plc could delay work to plug its Gulf of Mexico oil leak by up to 10 to 14 days if a northern Caribbean weather system strengthens and forces vessels at the spill site to move out of the way, the top official overseeing the spill response said on Wednesday. 

 "Any operations out there would have to be suspended whether it's containment or the relief well," retired U.S. Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen told reporters during a briefing. Without weather delays, work could continue on the relief well and BP could start a "static kill" of the leak by this weekend, he said.
