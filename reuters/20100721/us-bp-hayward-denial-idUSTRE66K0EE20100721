 LONDON  (Reuters) - BP Plc rejected a newspaper report on Wednesday that Chief Executive Tony Hayward was to step down within the next 10 weeks. 

 "He has full support from the board and will remain in place," a BP spokesman said. Britain's Times newspaper said there is a growing expectation that Hayward would announce his departure in late August or September. The report cited sources close to the company. Hayward had been under pressure to resign as the British-based company battles to contain an oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. (Reporting by Karolina Tagaris; Editing by Dhara Ranasinghe)
