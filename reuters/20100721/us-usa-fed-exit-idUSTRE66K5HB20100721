 (Reuters) - U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Wednesday said that the U.S. economy currently faces "unusually uncertain" prospects, but noted the central bank will eventually have to withdraw its extraordinary support for the economy. 

 The U.S. central bank's policy setting committee still expects economic conditions to warrant ultra-low interest rates for an "extended period", Bernanke said. "At some point, however, the Committee will need to begin to remove monetary policy accommodation to prevent the buildup of inflationary pressures," Bernanke said in the central bank's semiannual report to Congress on monetary policy. Below are some of the tools the Fed has at its disposal for eventually tightening monetary policy. PAYING INTEREST ON EXCESS RESERVES The interest rate the Fed pays on excess reserves will be the one to watch once the Fed -- the U.S. central bank -- begins to raise borrowing costs. By raising the rate it pays on bank reserves, the Fed creates a magnet for banks to keep those reserves with the Fed rather than lend them out. "By increasing the interest rate on reserves, the Federal Reserve will be able to put significant upward pressure on all short-term interest rates, as banks will not supply short-term funds to the money markets at rates significantly below what they can earn by holding reserves at the Federal Reserve Banks," Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke told lawmakers on March 25. A number of central banks around the world have effectively used similar tools. LARGE-SCALE REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS The Fed could arrange large-scale reverse repurchase agreements (reverse repos), with various financial market participants. This would temporarily drain reserves from the banking system and reduce excess liquidity at other institutions. This would be one way the Fed could "tighten the linkage" between interest on reserves and other short-term market interest rates, Bernanke said on July 21. Reverse repos involve the sale by the Fed of securities from its portfolio with an agreement to buy them back at a slightly higher price at a later date. TERM DEPOSIT FACILITY The Fed has authorized the creation of a new "term deposit facility" for banks, similar to certificates of deposit that banks offer retail customers. Like the reverse repos, this would reduce the supply of funds banks have available to lend to each other. While the Fed already pays interest on reserves held overnight, a term deposit facility would lock up funds for longer. ADJUST ITS REINVESTMENT POLICY The Fed could shift its approach to repayments of principal on the Treasury securities it holds to gradually normalize its balance sheet. The Fed could reinvest the proceeds from maturing longer-term Treasury securities to shorter-term issues. This would reduce the average maturity of the Treasury holdings toward pre-crisis levels, while leaving the overall value of the holdings unchanged, Bernanke said in his July 21 testimony. The Fed is currently not reinvesting its mortgage-related holdings. ASSET SALES The Fed could sell a portion of its securities holdings into the open market. Bernanke said on July 21 that members of the Fed's policy-setting committee agree that sales of agency-related securities should eventually be used to normalize the Fed's holdings. Bernanke said sales would be communicated well in advance and be conducted gradually. DISCOUNT RATE INCREASE The Fed in February raised the discount rate -- the rate it charges banks for emergency loans -- to 0.75 percent from 0.5 percent. It stressed the move reflected healing financial markets and was not a step to tighten lending conditions. The Fed has said it is studying whether further increases in the spread between the discount rate and the federal funds rate would be appropriate.
