 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The following are highlights from a Senate Banking Committee hearing on Wednesday with Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke testifying on the U.S. economy and Fed policy. 

 BERNANKE ON FURTHER STIMULUS POLICY OPTIONS: "Monetary policy is currently very stimulative. If the recovery seems to be faltering, then we at least need to review our options. We have not fully done that review and we need to think about possibilities. But broadly speaking, there are a number of things we can consider and look at. One would be further changes or modifications to our language or framework, describing how we intend to change interest rates over time, giving more information about that. We could lower the interest rate we pay on reserves, which is currently one fourth of one percent. The third will have to do with changes in our balance sheet and that would involve not either letting securities run off as they are currently or even making additional purchases. We have not come to the point where we can tell you precisely what the leading options are. Clearly each of these options has got drawbacks, potential costs. So we are going to continue to monitor the economy closely and continue to evaluate the alternatives that we have, recognizing that the policy is already stimulative. We still have options, but they are not going to be conventional options, so we need to look at them carefully and make sure we are comfortable with any step that we take." BERNANKE ON IMPLEMENTING FINANCIAL REGULATION LEGISLATION: "We think the framework in this bill is very constructive. ... For our part we intend to write rules that will implement the intent of Congress and will ... ensure that the risk of another crisis will be very low." "We are taking this very seriously. ... We are restructuring our entire supervisory framework." "We are also working with other international colleagues on capital and liquidity standards." BERNANKE ON NEED FOR LONG-TERM FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY: "If there is a loss of confidence in the financial markets that the United States is committed to and will achieve long-term fiscal sustainability, then the implications could be bad not only for our long-term growth prospects but they could actually hurt the current recovery (through) higher interest rates, for example, or higher inflation expectations." "So it is very important to demonstrate as best that we can, given of course the difficulties of committing future Congresses and so on, but to demonstrate as best as we can that we are serious about addressing long-term issues." BERNANKE ON MORE STIMULUS: Bernanke said some people want more government support for the economy, while others are concerned about the federal deficit and the possible negative impact of increasing it. "There's some truth to both of those arguments." "The best approach, in my view, is to maintain some fiscal support in the economy, but to combine that" with steps to address the fiscal issue. BERNANKE ON EU DEBT CRISIS: "The Europeans have been quite aggressive in addressing these problems. ... In the last few weeks we've seen some of the troubled governments being able to go back to the markets, which I think is encouraging." "My sense is that the financial markets' concern about the European problem has diminished somewhat recently." SENATE BANKING COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN Christopher Dodd ON BANKING BILL: "As you are aware, I have been critical of the Fed's past performance, and in fact advocated shrinking the Fed's supervisory roles. ... However, as the financial reform bill worked its way through the legislative process, the Congress in its wisdom decided not only to preserve the Fed's existing supervisory powers, but to bolster them." "Indeed, Mr. Chairman (Bernanke), you sought these additional powers. And, as a result, the Fed is central to maintaining our financial stability." "I think it is fair to say that the success of the financial reform law depends in large measure on how the Fed meets its new responsibilities. It is my fervent hope that, under your stewardship, the Fed will exercise these authorities wisely."
