 BOSTON  (Reuters) - General Electric Co ( GE.N ) said on Wednesday that it and its joint venture partners have signed some $16 billion worth of orders for aviation equipment at this week's Farnborough Air Show in the United Kingdom. 

 Among the largest orders, Dubai's Emirates Airline EMIRA.UL's order for 30 Boeing ( BA.N ) 777 aircraft included engines valued at $2 billion at list price; Air China ( 601111.SS ) chose $600 million of engines made by GE and a joint venture partner for its Airbus 830 aircraft; and China Eastern Airlines ( 600115.SS ) picked $600 million of GE venture-made engines for its Airbus 320 aircraft. In total, GE and its partners signed $11 billion in equipment sales and $5 billion in service deals. GE has engine joint ventures with France's Snecma, a unit of Safran SA ( SAF.PA ), and with United Technologies Corp ( UTX.N ). It also competes with United Tech in some businesses, as it does with Britain's Rolls-Royce Group PLC ( RR.L ) . GE's service business proved to be an important source of stable revenue during the recent economic downturn. (Reporting by  Scott Malone ; Editing by  Gary Hill )
