 London  (Reuters) - Oil fell slightly on Monday as a tropical storm looked set to spare major oil and gas infrastructure in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. 

 U.S. crude fell 15 cents to $113.62 a barrel by 12:10 p.m. EDT. London Brent crude dropped by 22 cents to $112.33 a barrel. World crude prices are more than 22 percent below the all-time peaks hit in mid-July, pulled lower by concerns that oil's six-year rally has significantly undercut world energy demand growth. Monday's mild losses came as Tropical Storm Fay appeared on a track that would narrowly avoid oil and gas production platforms in the Gulf of Mexico. "Fay's expected to miss the Gulf operations for the most part," said a NYMEX broker in New York. Shell ( RDSa.L ) said on Monday it had evacuated 425 nonessential workers from the Gulf but added that it did not expect any impact from the storm on offshore assets and production.  The storm was expected to strike Florida and move inland on Tuesday or Wednesday, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said in its latest forecast. Oil's losses were tempered by concerns over military tensions between Russia and Georgia that was hindering energy shipments through the region. BP Plc ( BP.L ) said exports of Azeri oil by rail to Georgia had stopped because of damage to a railway line in Georgia. Also tempering oil's weakness Monday was a decline in the value of the U.S. dollar, a factor that has boosted commodities markets in recent years by increasing the purchasing power of buyers using other currencies. But a worsening economic outlook suggested oil prices could fall further, the Centre for Global Energy Studies said in its Monthly report on Monday. "But OPEC, whose members are due to meet in early September, may act to prevent them from falling too far," it added.
