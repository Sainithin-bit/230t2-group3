 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Top miner BHP Billiton ( BLT.L ) ( BHP.AX ), bidding for rival Rio Tinto ( RIO.L ) ( RIO.AX ) in what would be the world's second-biggest takeover, posted a 12.4 percent rise in full-year net profit to a record $15.4 billion, as Chinese demand stoked a commodities boom. 

 Year-to-end-June net profit was up from $13.4 billion the previous year and in line with analysts' forecast. Shares in BHP, the world's biggest mining company, have fallen 5.4 percent this year to Friday's close, outperforming Australia's S&P/ASX 200 resources sector subindex .AXJR, which is off 9 percent. BHP declared a final dividend of 41 U.S. cents per share. ($1=A$1.15) (Reporting by  James Regan , editing by James Thornhill)
