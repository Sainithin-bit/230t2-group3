 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. airlines Delta Air Lines ( DAL.N ) and JetBlue Airways ( JBLU.O ) said on Sunday they would waive change fees for customers traveling on certain flights impacted by Tropical Storm Fay. 

 Delta said customers booked on flights through select Florida and Georgia cities could change their travel schedule without penalty or fees due to the flooding and high winds expected from the storm. Separately, JetBlue said it would waive change fees and fare differences for customers through select Florida airports. (Reporting by  Megan Davies ; Editing by Louise Heavens)
