 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Fannie Mae FNM.N and Freddie Mac FRE.N, the largest providers of financing for U.S. home loans, signaled on Friday the fastest growth in their investments since at least 2004. 

 The government-chartered companies bulked up their purchases of securities backed by home loans even after reporting billions of dollars in losses since June as real estate prices have tumbled and delinquencies have soared. However, regulators and lawmakers have urged the companies to expand their mortgage investments in a bid to stabilize the U.S. housing market. "It is good news for the mortgage markets, as two strong buyers have finally emerged," Howard Shapiro, an analyst at Fox-Pitt Kelton Cochran Caronia Waller said in a research note. The new assets also offer high margins relative to cost of debt used to fund the portfolio, he said. Mortgage purchase activity pushed McLean, Virginia-based Freddie Mac's investments to a record $737.54 billion in April, surging past the $728.41 billion portfolio at Fannie Mae. Both companies should also add to their portfolios boost this month, analysts said. Freddie Mac's retained purchases increased in April to $36.89 billion from $18.6 billion in March. Total purchase and sales agreements inched higher to $43.49 billion, the highest since mid-2003, from $43.48 billion in March. Washington-based Fannie Mae said it contracted to purchase and retain $30.66 billion in mortgages last month, up from $8.1 billion in March and the most since September 2004. Total purchase commitments rose to $45.85 billion from $31 billion. The companies, also known as government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), have boosted purchases of mortgages and securities after their regulator in March eased requirements on capital they must hold. Both have raised billions in new capital since November to prepare for growth while protecting against losses on bad mortgages. The companies encourage lending by buoying the market for home loans. More demand for mortgage bonds also reduces yields that drive mortgage rates. The GSEs have increased issuance of the debt that funds their portfolios. Yield premiums on their "agency" debt have largely held in this week despite $13 billion in sales from Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Bank system, which raises money for commercial banks to use in mortgage lending. "Traders will remain focused on GSE debt growth and worry about spreads," said Jim Vogel, a strategist at FTN Financial Capital Markets in Memphis, Tennessee, in an e-mail. Strong demand for the current supply suggests the companies should be able to manage their debt funding needs without sharply affecting spreads, he added. The financial health of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is also important to a plan approved by the Senate Banking Committee this week, which would have the companies help foot the bill for expansion of a government-backed mortgage refinancings. The companies hold charters to support U.S. housing by raising money from investors. Shares of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac fell 0.5 percent and 1.8 percent at midday in New York. (Editing by Tom Hals)
