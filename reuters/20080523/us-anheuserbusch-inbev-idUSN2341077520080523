 PHILADELPHIA  (Reuters) - Belgian brewer InBev NV is weighing a takeover offer for U.S. brewing company Anheuser-Busch Cos Inc, but it is uncertain whether it will proceed with a formal bid, a source familiar with the situation said on Friday. 

 The Financial Times reported on its Alphaville blog that the bid could be in the range of $46 billion, and financing had been provisionally arranged through JPMorgan and Santander. The source cautioned that InBev is mulling an offer and talking to potential lenders, but no final decision had been reached. InBev declined to comment, and Anheuser-Busch was not immediately available to comment. (Reporting by  Jessica Hall ) (For more M&A news and our DealZone blog, go to  here )
