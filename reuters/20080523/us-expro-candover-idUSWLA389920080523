 LONDON  (Reuters) - Funds managed by private equity firm Candover ( CDI.L ) and investment bank Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) said they had raised their offer for British oil field services company Expro International EXR.L to 1,550 pence a share. 

 The independent directors of Expro said they recommended the cash offer. Earlier on Friday, Expro said that it had received a higher approach at 1,525p per share, worth 1.7 billion pounds ($3.37 billion), from U.S. rival Halliburton ( HAL.N ). (Reporting by Mike Elliott)
