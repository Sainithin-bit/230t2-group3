 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - FGIC Corp, a bond insurance company that is trying to recapitalize itself, posted a $33.4 million loss for the first quarter on Friday amid rising potential losses from insuring bonds linked to subprime mortgages. 

 The company recorded a $1.56 billion gain from a reduction in the value of derivative liabilities during the quarter. FGIC Corp, parent of Financial Guaranty Insurance Co, said it lost $33.4 million in the first quarter, compared with profit of $68.5 million in the same quarter last year.
