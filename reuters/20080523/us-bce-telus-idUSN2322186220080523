 TORONTO  (Reuters) - Telus Corp ( T.TO ) will likely wait for the dust to settle in the courtroom drama surrounding BCE Inc ( BCE.TO )( BCE.N ) and its C$34.8-billion ($35.2 billion) privatization before it seriously considers returning with a renewed bid for the company. 

 Telus, Canada's No. 2 telephone company, will also want to wait until it sees the outcome of an upcoming auction of Canadian wireless spectrum, which will help it gauge how much more competition is coming to the country's wireless market. Analysts say the auction should be wrapped up by mid-July, as should an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada that was launched by BCE after this week's surprise court ruling that sided with the company's bondholders and threatened to scuttle the BCE buyout. The bondholders alleged that the buyout by the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan and its U.S. private-equity partners is unfair to them. There would be no point in Telus bidding before the Supreme Court's opinion is known. If the court sides with BCE and overturns this week's ruling, the Teachers' buyout will triumph. Teachers' current C$42.75 a share offer price is too rich to match for Vancouver-based Telus, which was in talks last year to acquire BCE before walking away, citing "inadequacies" in the bidding process. Credit markets are also tight and Telus shares are down 28 percent from a year ago, making them a less attractive takeover currency. However, if the Supreme Court sides with the bondholders, the Teachers' buyout could collapse, taking BCE's already battered share price with it to C$30 or so. "If that's the case, then ... (Telus) probably have time on their side," MacDougall, MacDougall & MacTier analyst Troy Crandall said. "I don't think there'll be many other private-equity offers coming to the table just given the state of the market." BCE's stock was at C$32.97 on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Friday, reflecting investor concerns the Teachers' deal won't get done at the current offer price. Part of what would prop up BCE shares if the Teachers' buyout collapsed is the possibility of a Telus bid, even though the offer would almost certainly be lower than C$42.75. But an offer from Telus isn't without problems independent of the credit and equity markets. Most notably, it raises regulatory concerns because it would combine the country's top two telephone companies and two of the country's biggest wireless providers. That's a move clearly at odds with the federal government's stated intention of stimulating telecom competition. At the same time, the two companies' wireless businesses are extremely lucrative and Telus wouldn't want to divest any of those assets as part of a merger. That's why the wireless spectrum auction could provide ammunition for Telus if it needs to deal with regulatory scrutiny as part of a renewed bid for BCE. If the wireless spectrum auction that kicks off next week yields at least one more national player -- taking the total to four -- Telus could argue a takeover of BCE wouldn't dent competition sufficiently to merit forced asset sales. Another problem is that Telus could make a bid conditional on regulatory approval of a combination of the two companies' wireless businesses, "and such approval may not be forthcoming," Genuity Capital Markets analyst Dvai Ghose wrote in a recent note to clients. "Consequently, we believe that a potential Telus bid has challenges," he wrote. "However, we would not ignore the potential of this transaction and the fact that it could lead to very meaningful synergies for both sets of shareholders." Telus shares were up 12 Canadian cents at C$47.80 on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon. ($1=$0.99 Canadian) (Reporting by Wojtek Dabrowski; editing by Peter Galloway)
