 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - InBev, the world's second-largest beer producer by volume, said on Friday it would not comment on a report on the Financial Times website that it was working on a $46 billion bid for Anheuser Busch. 

 "We will not make a comment," the spokeswoman said. Earlier, the same spokeswoman said she had no immediate comment to make before reading the report.
