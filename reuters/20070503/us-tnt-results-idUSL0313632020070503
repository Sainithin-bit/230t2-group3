 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - Dutch mail company TNT NV TNT.ASTNT.N said on Thursday its first-quarter operating profit rose 7 percent, helped by a one-off gain on the sale of real estate, and reiterated its full-year outlook. 

 Earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) rose to 351 million euros ($479 million) from 327 million euros in the previous year and compared with the average forecast of 340 million euros in a Reuters survey of nine analysts. Results of TNT's Dutch mail business benefited from a 14 million euro real estate gain as well as close cost controls, while mail volume remained under pressure due to competition and the popularity of email and online services such as banking. "Excluding this gain, results are below expectation mainly as the organic growth of Express Europe ... dropped to 7.6 percent from 10.9 percent in Q4," Petercam analysts said in a note. TNT reiterated its full-year revenue and operating margin forecasts for its mail and express divisions. TNT shares traded down 0.2 percent at 32.96 euros in early trade in Amsterdam, while the DJ Stoxx European industrials index .SXNP rose 0.4 percent. Revenue increased 9 percent to 2.68 billion euros, in line with average analyst expectations. A 195 million euro profit on the sale of its freight management unit boosted net profit, which more than doubled to 427 million euros from 205 million. The increase in earnings per share was even stronger at 134 percent as TNT bought back shares. VOLUME DECLINE Mail volumes in the Netherlands declined by 4.3 percent, while TNT's non-Dutch mail operations posted revenue growth, excluding acquisitions, of 25.2 percent. The company is seeking to compensate for falling mail volumes at home by growth abroad. TNT still has a monopoly on letters of up to 50 grams, about half the 2 billion-euro Dutch mail market, which the government plans to scrap from January 2008. Parliament again delayed a vote on the new postal law last month, with uncertainty over the timing and conditions for liberalization weighing on TNT shares. At TNT's express delivery business, which competes with UPS ( UPS.N ), FedEx ( FDX.N ) and Deutsche Post's ( DPWGn.DE ) DHL, EBIT margin slipped to 8.0 percent from 8.3 percent due to lower-margin acquisitions, but average revenues per kilo and per consignment rose for the 13th consecutive quarter.
