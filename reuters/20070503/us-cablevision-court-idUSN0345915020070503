 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Cablevision Systems Corp. ( CVC.N ) shareholder Gamco Investors Inc. ( GBL.N ) is weighing whether to ask a court to determine a fair value for the cable company, as it believes Cablevision is worth significantly more than a $10.6 billion offer on the table. 

 The New York-area cable operator and entertainment group, which is incorporated in Delaware, agreed on Wednesday to be taken private in a $36.26-a-share bid from the Dolan family. The Dolans own 20 percent of the company's common stock and have 70 percent of the voting power. Asset manager Mario Gabelli, whose Gamco Investors holds 20 million Cablevision shares on behalf of its clients, said the offer undervalues Cablevision's assets by $15 a share. That would mean he values the assets at more than $51 a share, or about $15 billion. To read this story click nN03259608. Gabelli told Reuters he was considering electing "dissenter rights" under which a court would be asked to determine what it considers to be a fair price for the company. He added he was "not sure we want to go that route" but had "lawyers lined up already." Under terms of the Cablevision takeover pact, the deal can be called off by the purchasers, the Dolans, if the total number of dissenting shares exceeds 10 percent of its outstanding Class A shares. In certain transactions under Delaware law, shareholders can dissent from accepting an offer, and request a judge to determine the value of the shares, a securities lawyer who declined to be named told Reuters. That value, determined by the judge, would then be paid to the shareholder, rather than the offer price. As this process can take a long time, a buyer of a company may not want to close a deal without knowing how much they will be liable to pay to such shareholders, the lawyer said. Sometimes in deals where such rights exist, a buyer will not want to close on a deal if a significant number of the shareholders go this route, as they have no way of knowing how much they will be liable to pay. Gabelli cited another case where his fund had pursued this route -- the 2001 takeover of health care and consumer products maker Carter-Wallace Inc. Gamco said in a 2004 press release its clients got $29 per share of settlement proceeds after going to court to request another valuation of the deal. That was 40 percent more than the $20.44 Carter-Wallace was sold for. Gabelli told Reuters he was examining all alternatives and had not yet decided how to vote on the takeover deal. Cablevision and a representative for the Dolans declined comment.
