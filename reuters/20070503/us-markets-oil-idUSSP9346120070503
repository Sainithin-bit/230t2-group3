 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Thursday after Nigerian militants freed several foreign workers seized from an offshore oil field, easing fears the conflict would further interrupt the nation's production. 

 London Brent crude, currently seen as the most representative of global oil prices, settled 20 cents lower at $66.05 a barrel after falling as low as $65.57 earlier. U.S. crude, supported recently by concerns over slim gasoline supplies ahead of the summer driving season, fell 49 cents to $63.19. Prices had climbed earlier in the session after gunmen seized 18 foreign workers in three attacks in Nigeria's oil-producing Niger Delta. The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta said later it had freed eight of the workers. Militant attacks in the world's eighth-largest oil exporter, which have increased sharply in the past year, have shut output of about 600,000 barrels per day, or a fifth of production capacity. But analysts believe the region's volatility has already been priced into the market. "This news has not registered as it might have at some other time, showing participants' willingness to shed length at these price levels," said John Kilduff of Man Financial. MEND said the recent kidnappings should serve as a warning to foreign companies not to return to oil fields previously attacked by the group. News that Royal Dutch Shell was preparing to restart operations at its 380,000 barrel per day Forcados oil fields in Nigeria, shut for more than a year due to security concerns, also pressured prices. The company declined to provide a specific date and many analysts have raised doubts about its resumption. "We remain skeptical that a sustainable increase in Nigerian production can actually be achieved," said Kevin Norrish of Barclays Capital. In Asia, Exxon Mobil said it had shut a 115,000 bpd crude unit at its giant Singapore refinery indefinitely as a result of a fire in a related unit, threatening to tighten Pacific Basin gasoline supplies.
