 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Sears Holdings Corp. ( SHLD.O ) on Thursday said sales at its Kmart and U.S. Sears stores both fell in the first quarter, but said it expected profit to rise due to several one-time items. 

 The company said same-store sales fell 4.7 percent at Kmart and 2.4 percent at U.S. Sears stores.
