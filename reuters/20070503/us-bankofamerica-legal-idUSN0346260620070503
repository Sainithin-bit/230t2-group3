 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp. ( BAC.N ) said on Thursday that it saw its agreement to buy ABN AMRO's AAH.AS U.S. unit LaSalle as a binding contract and that it would take "all necessary steps" to protect its legal rights. 

 Bank of America spokesman Scott Silvestri made the comment hinting at possible legal action in a one-sentence statement emailed to reporters. He declined to elaborate. Earlier on Thursday, a Dutch court told ABN to freeze the $21 billion deal to sell its U.S. unit, making it easier for a rival group of suitors to bid for all of ABN.
