 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) said on 
Thursday it contributed $1.1 billion to U.S. hourly associates 
through profit sharing and 401(k) accounts, stock purchase 
plans and merchandise discounts in its last fiscal year. 

  It was the first time that Wal-Mart, which faces criticism 
from labor groups and politicians for its pay and health-care 
practices, disclosed the contributions. Spokeswoman Sarah Clark 
said the retailer was not providing previous figures.  Earlier this year, Wal-Mart said it was paying almost $530 
million in bonuses to hourly U.S. store employees, marking the 
first time the retailer had released the bonuses.  Wal-Mart said that historically it has contributed 2 
percent of an employee's pay to a profit-sharing plan and 2 
percent to a 401(k) retirement plan.  The retailer said employees do not have to contribute their 
own money to the plans to get the company contribution.  For its fiscal year ending January 31, Wal-Mart said it 
contributed $667 million to 815,629 hourly associates in 
profit-sharing and 401(k) contributions; $51.4 million to 
706,389 hourly associates toward its associate stock purchase 
plan; and $397 million in discounted merchandise.  Wal-Mart shares rose 14 cents to $48.42 in afternoon New 
York Stock Exchange trading.
