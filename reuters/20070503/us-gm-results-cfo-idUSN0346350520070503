 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) Chief Financial Officer Fritz Henderson said on Thursday the "maelstrom" in the subprime market caused the automaker's quarterly results to fall short of forecasts and limited its ability to predict longer-term earnings from its formerly wholly owned finance unit GMAC. 

 Weaker GMAC results were the major reason GM's own quarterly earnings fell short of Wall Street expectations. Charges related to the mortgage lending unit more than offset an improvement in GM's core auto operations, Henderson said. "I think investors understood that issues in nonprime would not be limited to the fourth quarter, that you would see some effect in 2007, but frankly I don't think that was fully factored in," Henderson told reporters after GM reported its first-quarter results. GM, which still owns a 49 percent stake in GMAC, realized a loss of $115 million in the first quarter from its investment in the finance company. GMAC has said it expects improved results at its housing finance unit, ResCap, this quarter. Henderson declined to go beyond that forecast. "I think it's important when you're in the midst of the kind of maelstrom we're in with nonprime, I think it's important to take it quarter by quarter," he said. "That is why we decided to limit our forecast to just the second quarter instead of trying to take a look through the year." Separately, Henderson said labor-related negotiations between bankrupt former parts subsidiary Delphi Corp. DPHIQ.PK, GM and union representatives were continuing "virtually every day." He said that while he had not seen a new proposal from the United Auto Workers union on Delphi, it was "reasonable to expect one." Henderson declined to offer a detailed second-quarter forecast for GM when asked if improved auto operations would be able to offset any continued drag from GMAC. "We expect to improve automotive operations this year ... but I'm not going to get into quarter by quarter," he said. GM concluded a deal to sell a 51 percent stake in GMAC to an investor group led by Cerberus Capital Management at end-November last year. Because of losses at GMAC's ResCap, GM agreed to inject $1 billion back into GMAC in the first quarter.
