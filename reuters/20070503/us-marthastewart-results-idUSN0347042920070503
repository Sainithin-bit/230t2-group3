 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc. ( MSO.N ) reported a wider quarterly loss on Thursday after taking a charge related to the production of its syndicated television program, while revenue rose on higher advertising sales at its magazines. 

 The publisher of magazines such as Martha Stewart Living, Blueprint and Everyday Food also said it will launch a food line with warehouse club operator Costco Wholesale Corp.  ( COST.O ) "Kirkland Signature by Martha Stewart" will be a combination of fresh and frozen food that the companies plan to roll out in 2008. Chief Executive Susan Lyne declined to provide financial terms or say whether the deal is exclusive, but she said the Costco venture will be the company's primary focus in its food business. "They're the fifth largest retailer in the country," Lyne told Reuters. "They have a real dominant presence in that space." The publishing business, meanwhile, helped the company post a 7.4 percent rise in total revenue to $66.7 million in the first quarter. The first-quarter net loss increased to $11.9 million, or 23 cents a share, from $6.8 million, or 13 cents a share, in the same period last year. Excluding the TV show charge, the loss per share from continuing operations was 12 cents, better than two analysts' estimates of a loss of 17 cents per share. Publishing revenue rose 20 percent because of a higher number of ad pages in its magazines as well as higher rates. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) was $2.4 million, up from $800,000 in the first quarter a year ago. The company also forecast second-quarter revenue of $69 million to $72 million and an adjusted EBITDA loss of $1 million to $3 million. That includes a $3 million investment in Blueprint magazine, the company said. It forecast full-year revenue of $330 million to $340 million and adjusted EBITDA of $34 million to $37 million, which included an $8 million investment in Blueprint. The company said it recorded a noncash compensation expense of $5.7 million, or 11 cents a share, in the latest quarter related to the production of its syndicated TV show. Martha Stewart shares fell 12 cents to $18.63 on the New York Stock Exchange.
