 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Playtex Products Inc. PYX.N posted a higher quarterly net profit on Thursday, as growth in the Banana Boat and Wet Ones brands offset a decline in sales of feminine care products, but earnings and sales fell short of Wall Street targets. 

 The company also lowered its 2007 outlook. Net profit was $12.8 million, or 20 cents per share, in the first quarter, compared with $12.1 million, or 19 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts, on average, had been expecting Westport, Connecticut-based Playtex to post earnings of 22 cents on net revenue of $190.5 million, according to Reuters Estimates. Net sales rose 3 percent in the quarter to $180.9 million, the company said. Sales of Playtex' skin care group, the largest category, rose 8 percent, while sales of feminine care products fell 6 percent in the quarter. Infant care net sales rose 3 percent. In April, Playtex became the No. 1 U.S. seller of sun protection products when it bought the owner of Hawaiian Tropic. Playtex already made Banana Boat sunscreen. Playtex said it was not changing an original 2007 outlook related to its historical businesses. But the company said that due to the acquisition, net sales for 2007 were expected to rise by $95 million to $100 million, including $50 million for Hawaiian Tropic. Excluding special items, earnings per share for 2007 should range between 51 cents to 55 cents, assuming operating margins slightly below 2006 levels and interest expense approximately even with a year earlier. That was below a range the company gave in February of 60 cents to 63 cents, excluding items. Playtex also said in February that 2007 sales would rise in the high single digits, with quarterly variability. Wall Street, on average, has been expecting full-year earnings of 55 cents, according to Reuters Knowledge. The company said in April that the deal should reduce 2007 earnings by 7 cents to 10 cents per share due to the seasonality of the business and the timing of the closing, but add moderately to earnings over the first 12 months of ownership. Shares of Playtex closed up 37 cents at $15.81 on the New York Stock Exchange.
