 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - North American steel companies are in a consolidation that is sweeping the continent and is catching nearly every independent player in an updraft as they become potential targets. 

 Large international steel companies are not just interested in megadeals, such as Mittal Steel's MTBL.BR more than $30 billion hostile purchase of Arcelor last year that started the global buying frenzy, or Tata Steel's TSTH.BK $12 billion purchase of Corus Group CSB.L CS.AS earlier this year. That means more deals are ahead for the smaller, independent steel companies here, bankers said. "Everybody wants to be a global player," said Michael Canmann, a managing director in the industrials banking group for Citigroup based in Chicago "The big players want a place in all the markets -- Western Europe, the United States, and Asia." Companies such as Russia's Evraz Group SA HK1q.L and Severstal ( CHMF.MM ), Mittal, India's Essar Steel ESRG.BO and Brazil's CSN ( CSNA3.SA ) ( SID.N ) all have bought assets here already, he pointed out. "Everyone is trying to make an effort," he said, explaining why the U.S. steel market is attractive. "Domestic steel consumption grows consistently year over year and the United States does not have capacity to meet domestic demand. These facts, combined with the domestic customers desire for high quality steels, makes the U.S. a very attractive market for global players." Just today, specialty steel producer SSAB ( SSABb.ST ) said it would buy Canadian-U.S. steel pipe maker Ipsco IPS.TO IPS.N for $7.7 billion. Earlier this week, Ternium SA ( TX.N ), Latin America's largest steel company, agreed to take control of Mexico's Grupo IMSA SAB de CV IMSA.MX for $1.7 billion. MORE DEALS In April, India's Essar bought two North American steel companies -- Algoma Steel AGA.TO, which had previously been in bankruptcy, and privately held Minnesota Steel, which has a large steel mill in development and said it planned to expand further. That came just a few weeks after U.S. Steel ( X.N ) bought Lone Star Technologies LSS.N for $2.1 billion. In February, Tenaris SA ( TENA.BA ) said it would buy Hydril HYDL.O for more than $2 billion and in January Nucor agreed to buy Canada's Harris Steel Group HSG.TO for more than $1 billion. And last fall, Evraz made a deal to buy Oregon Steel, which closed this year. In addition, Chaparral Steel CHAP.OQ, which has a market cap of more than $3 billion, has said it is in sales discussions, while steel services company Ryerson ( RYI.N ) is also considering a sale after coming under pressure from activist investor Harbinger Capital Partners. And each time a deal is announced, or a company says it is in talks and considering selling, shares of its competitors have jumped on speculation that they will be next. Since the beginning of the year, the Standard & Poor's Steel Index .GSPSTEEL has risen 25 percent. AK Steel Holding ( AKS.N ), Stelco ( STE.TO ), Steel Dynamics ( STLD.O ) and Commercial Metals ( CMC.N ), the remaining midsized players, along with the larger US Steel and Nucorp, are among those whose stocks have benefited. US Steel is up 41 percent this year, for instance, and Steel Dynamics is up nearly 28 percent. Ipsco has gained 50 percent. JUST A HANDFUL "There's basically a handful of companies left and there are more than a handful of players from an international perspective which have been interested in North America," said Dieter Hoeppli, managing director of the metal and mining group at UBS. Many steel companies from emerging markets have significant cost advantages in their steel production because they have access to low-cost raw materials such as iron ore, coal and electricity, he said. "They are looking for ways of extending the value chain and the North America marketplace in steel is the highest value-added, most attractive steel pricing steel market," Hoeppli said. "These players are now looking to get a foothold here in North America." That increase in stocks could mean valuation will be an issue for future deals. Buyers look at earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization as one factor in determining the price they will pay and the multiples of that they have paid in recent deals has been rising. One subsector where multiples are high and consolidation is active is tubular steel, which is used by the energy industry. Because it is related to the energy sector, the margins and the sale prices are higher. But that has not stopped the deals. Lonestar, Maverick, the NS Group and now Ipsco have been sold or agreed to be sold. "Once those guys are gone and consolidated, that's it. So you've got to pick your spot," Canmann said.
