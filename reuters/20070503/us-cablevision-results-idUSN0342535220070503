 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Cablevision Systems Corp. ( CVC.N ), which has agreed to be taken private by its controlling shareholders, reported slower first-quarter subscriber growth on Thursday as competition increased from Verizon Communications Inc. ( VZ.N ) 

 While the New York-based cable television operator narrowed its quarterly loss, it added subscribers to its triple play offering of digital television, phone and Internet services at a much slower rate than in the year ago quarter. Analysts said Cablevision's market is reaching a saturation point as rival telephone company Verizon has begun offering digital TV. Cablevision said up to 900,000 of the 4 million homes in its area can now be served by Verizon's advanced fiber optic (FiOS) services, though Verizon has not activated all of them. "I think our churn is impacted by FiOS competition, it has an impact on our numbers," said Chief Operating Officer Tom Rutledge on a conference call. Churn is the industry term for customer losses. Cablevision's shares dipped 1 percent, or 36 cents, to $35.55 on the New York Stock Exchange. Cablevision said on Wednesday its board accepted the Dolan family's offer to take the company private for $36.26 per share, valuing the company at about $10.6 billion. Executives on the conference call on Thursday could not give a date for a shareholder vote on the proposal. "There are a few investors who want more, but we don't see there being a better offer from the Dolans," said Thomas Eagan, analyst at Oppenheimer who downgraded Cablevision to neutral. "We do not expect a higher third-party bid." The company, which is highly leveraged after investing in network upgrades through the 1990s, said its first-quarter net loss narrowed to $26.3 million, or 9 cents a share, from a loss of $58 million, or 20 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts polled by Reuters Estimates expected the company to report a net loss of $19.9 million, or 7 cents a share. Revenue rose 12.5 percent to $1.59 billion, in line with market expectations. Cablevision added 12,000 basic video subscribers during the quarter, far short of the 38,722 users it added a year ago and missing Eagan's forecast for 25,000 additions. It added another 65,000 digital video subscribers versus 164,659 additions a year ago. Cablevision also added 78,000 high-speed Internet subscribers, compared with 112,289 additions in 2006. Eagan had forecast Cablevision to add 118,000 digital video subscribers and 83,000 high-speed Internet subscribers. Cablevision said it added 109,000 phone subscribers versus 133,967 additions a year earlier. Eagan had forecast 93,000 phone additions. (Additional reporting by Robert Macmillan)
