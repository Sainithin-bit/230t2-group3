 (Reuters) - A Dutch court is due to decide on Thursday whether to uphold ABN AMRO's AAH.AS sale of U.S. unit LaSalle to Bank of America ( BAC.N ), potentially throwing into question ABN's $88 billion agreed takeover by Britain's Barclays Plc 

  ( BARC.L ). A ruling against the U.S. deal could make it easier for a rival group of suitors led by Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ) -- for whom LaSalle is a key asset -- to table a bid for the ABN group. But it could also trigger legal action from BoA, delaying any takeover outcome. The following are key dates in the battle for ABN. ** UPCOMING DATES: May 3 - The commercial court in Amsterdam is due to rule around 1400 GMT on the sale of LaSalle Bank after shareholder group VEB said a sale without shareholder approval was unlawful and hindered a takeover by the RBS-led group. May 4 - Seven days after notifying the ABN board the RBS consortium can make an unsolicited bid for ABN and publish its offer price. May 6 - Under the terms of the LaSalle sale the deal closes at midnight, New York time, on May 6. Any suitors have until then to trump Bank of America's $21 billion offer. BoA then has another 5 working days to match any counterbid. ------------------------------------------------------- ** CHRONOLOGY OF KEY EVENTS TO DATE: February 21 - Hedge fund TCI, with a stake of more than one percent in ABN, writes to ABN management saying it is undervalued and should be broken up or merged. ABN shares rise almost 6 percent to a 6-year high. February 24 - Dutch Central Bank President Nout Wellink expresses concern about the TCI push for a break-up of ABN in a newspaper interview, saying it is "a bridge too far". He is later criticized by the European Commission for the comments. March 7 - British fund Toscafund joins in calls for a shake-up at ABN, saying the bank's management "has failed to deliver acceptable returns". Dutch bank SNS SR.AS, whose asset management arm owns 0.23 percent of ABN, also says it is concerned about strategy. March 19 - Barclays and ABN confirm exclusive talks. Both sides say negotiations are at an "exploratory stage". March 20 - Barclays and ABN outline the plan for a potential merger. The merged entity would have a chairman nominated by ABN and a chief executive named by Barclays, it have its head office in Amsterdam and use the Dutch Central Bank as lead regulator. March 26 - TCI says it may take legal action against ABN if the bank does not consider offers from suitors besides Barclays. March 27 - Barclays President Bob Diamond says the bank is in "a strong position" in its talks with ABN. Separately, in a letter to staff, Chief Executive John Varley says the bank will walk away from talks if it is not able to negotiate a deal on the right terms. March 28 - ABN says it will let shareholders vote on TCI's shake-up proposals, but recommends against the measures. Later that day, sources familiar with the matter say Barclays hires rival Citigroup ( C.N ) to join its roster of advisors, indicating the U.S. giant will not make a counterbid. April 9 - Dutch Central Bank President Wellink says the regulator would not object in principle to an offer by a rival bidder for ABN, even if that means a break-up. April 13 - RBS, Spain's Santander ( SAN.MC ) and Fortis FOR.BR say they have approached ABN inviting it to talks and asking for access to its board and books. ABN says it will "consider the letter carefully". April 16 - ABN reports double-digit earnings gains on Monday, ahead of schedule, strengthening its hand in talks. April 17 - Barclays and ABN extend merger talks beyond an initial 30 days, giving them until April 20, the final day for institutional shareholders to register their vote ahead of an April 26 AGM. ABN says separately it will talk to the rival suitors. April 18 - The Dutch central bank says an offer from the trio of banks would entail "strong risks and complications". Separately, TCI says talks next week with the trio of suitors would be too late, calling the timing "disingenuous". April 23 - Barclays agrees to buy ABN in a recommended all-share deal, offering 3.225 shares for each ABN share -- $88 billion at current prices. ABN says separately it will sell U.S. bank LaSalle to Bank of America for $21 billion. April 25 - RBS, Santander and Fortis propose a cash-and-share offer for ABN worth some $98 billion, if ABN scraps its planned sale of LaSalle. After talks, ABN agrees to open its books to the consortium, but subject to a confidentiality clause that blocks an unsolicited bid for 12 months. April 26 - ABN investors, in a heated meeting in Amsterdam, vote in favor of a motion, tabled by TCI, to break-up or sell the bank to maximize shareholder value. April 27 - The RBS-led consortium says it notified ABN's board the previous evening that it intends to make an offer, paving the way for a unsolicited bid. In response, hours later, ABN lifts the contentious "standstill" provision blocking a hostile bid. May 1 - ABN writes to the consortium asking for more detail on the financing and structure of the bid. Separately, TCI writes to ABN's supervisory board, asking them to take control of the bank's sale and to sack the chairman of ABN's managing board, Rijkman Groenink over his failure to support overtures from the RBS-led consortium.
