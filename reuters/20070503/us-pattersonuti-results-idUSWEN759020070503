 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Land-based contract driller Patterson-UTI Energy Inc. ( PTEN.O ) said on Thursday that first-quarter profit fell 27 percent, hurt by soft demand from gas-producing customers. 

 The Snyder, Texas-based company said its first-quarter profit was $116 million, or 73 cents per share, compared with $159 million, or 91 cents per share, a year earlier.
