 ZURICH  (Reuters) - Swiss bank UBS shocked investors by reporting lower first quarter net profits on Thursday and the closure of its Dillon Read hedge fund arm which was hit by losses in the U.S. subprime mortgage market, sparking a selloff in its shares. 

 Dillon Read Capital Management ran up losses of 150 million Swiss francs ($124 million) in the first quarter, becoming the latest casualty of the crisis earlier in this year in the U.S. subprime sector. "This was related to the U.S. mortgage securities market, which was obviously weakened by the U.S. subprime sector," Chief Financial Officer Clive Standish said in a conference call with financial journalists. UBS net profit slipped to 3.275 billion francs in the first quarter, below the 3.40 billion franc average forecast in a Reuters poll and the 3.50 billion francs in the year-ago period. "We think there will be some restructuring costs of up to $300 million," said Chief Financial Officer Clive Standish. He added that the costs would be offset by savings of about $200 million at some point. UBS shares were trading 2.65 percent lower at 0805 GMT, while the Dow Jones Stoxx banking index was 0.23 percent down. The fiasco at Dillon Read was the main blemish in the quarterly report at UBS, which is the world's largest wealth manager. Net new money flowing into wealth management was 44.8 billion francs, well ahead of forecasts, sending group client assets to 3.112 trillion francs. Analysts had expected to see 31.8 billion francs in net new money. UBS said pretax profit at its investment bank division reached a quarterly record of 1.801 billion francs, a rise of 3 percent from a year earlier. But some analysts said they were disappointed. "At first glance both the net profit and the operating profit in the investment bank aren't convincing," wrote analysts at Swiss bank Wegelin. "When you look at yesterday's good results at Credit Suisse you can expect some profit taking." The decision to reintegrate Dillon Read Capital Management and to redeem third-party funds means the business is being wound up. Others said that the results at UBS's wealth management arm were impressive while the investment banking business was holding up well. "The net new money is very strong, better than Credit Suisse, and the non-compensation costs in investment banking, which is the thing that sparked the selloff last year, have significantly improved," said Jon Peace at Fox-Pitt Kelton. "Although opening indications are down you will see buyers coming in after the initial knee-jerk reaction," said Peace. COSTLY CLOSURE It was the latest blow for UBS, which has worried investors after ramping up costs in an acquisition drive. UBS launched its alternative investments business, Dillon Read Capital Management, last year to great fanfare, putting the former head of its investment bank division, John Costas, at the helm and transferring traders and assets from its investment banking division. The move to reincorporate the unit comes just as other investment banks ramp up hedge fund activities to meet demand for alternative investments among institutions and wealthy individuals. Investors, eager to boost returns or diversify their holdings in traditional securities, have fuelled a boom in hedge funds and other vehicles offering alternative strategies. Strong results at rival U.S. banks had raised expectations that UBS would deliver an impressive performance in its investment banking division. A string of acquisitions last year by UBS, including U.S. wealth manager McDonald Investments and Pactual, raised concerns among investors that the Swiss bank was driving up its costs too fast and risked being caught out if markets turned sour. Those worries have weighed on UBS's share price, which is up 6.89 percent since the start of the year but has been outshone by rival Credit Suisse, whose shares have jumped nearly 12 percent over the same period.
