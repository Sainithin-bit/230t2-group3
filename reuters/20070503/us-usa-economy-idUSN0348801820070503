 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The vast services sector expanded at a faster pace than expected in April and productivity improved more than forecast in the first quarter, reports showed on Thursday, easing concerns about economic weakness and inflation. 

 Economists said the data, especially if followed by a strong April jobs report on Friday, would keep Federal Reserve interest rate policy on hold. The Institute for Supply Management said its non-manufacturing index, a measure of the largest sector of the economy, rose to 56.0 in April from 52.4 in March. That beat expectations for a reading of 53.0. Another report, from the Labor Department, showed U.S. business productivity rose at an unexpectedly strong annualized rate of 1.7 percent in the first three months of 2007 and labor costs increased far less than forecast. The data dampened concerns the tight labor market would prove inflationary. Stocks rose on Wall Street and the dollar also gained. Government bonds fell, since they usually benefit more from signs of economic weakness and heightened expectations that the Federal Reserve will lower benchmark interest rates. "The ISM index was another good number for the economy," said Gary Thayer, chief economist at A.G. Edwards and Sons in St. Louis. "Bond prices are down on this number. It means the Fed is probably going to stay on hold for a while." The service sector represents about 80 percent of U.S. economic activity -- everything from restaurants and hotels to banks and airlines. A separate report showed the number of U.S. workers filing new claims for jobless benefits fell unexpectedly, by 21,000 in the latest week, to the lowest level since January. Initial filings for state unemployment insurance claims slid to 305,000 in the week ending April 28 from an upwardly revised 326,000 the previous week. JOBS REPORT AHEAD The data came a day before the government publishes its monthly labor market report, which is usually one of the biggest economic releases on financial markets' calendar. In a Reuters poll conducted last week, economists predicted Friday's figures would show job growth slowed in April to 100,000 from 180,000 in the previous month. Analysts expect the unemployment rate to be up to 4.5 percent in April from 4.4 percent in March. In a more recent gauge, traders were betting on Thursday that U.S. employers added 88,800 jobs in April, according to the implied median market forecast of a derivatives auction. With the unemployment rate near its lowest in six years, investors have worried that this could keep inflation above the Federal Reserve's comfort zone of 1 to 2 percent for longer than anticipated. Even so, Thursday's data suggested that price pressures emanating from the labor market are not accelerating. Unit labor costs grew by an annualized 0.6 percent in the first three months of the year, well below the 4 percent rise analysts were expecting. It was the smallest advance in labor costs since a decline of 2.5 percent in the second quarter of 2006. The rise in unit labor costs in the first quarter was much slower than the 6.2 percent increase in the fourth quarter of 2006, which was originally reported as a 6.6 percent gain.
