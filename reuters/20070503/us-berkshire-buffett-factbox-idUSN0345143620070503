 OMAHA, Nebraska  (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Warren 
Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway Inc. will hold its annual 
shareholder meeting on Saturday in Omaha, Nebraska, is perhaps 
America's most-revered capitalist. 

 * Buffett, 76, bought Berkshire, a textile maker, in 1965. 
As of Wednesday, Berkshire's market value was about $167 
billion. Berkshire owns more than 50 companies, including auto 
insurer Geico, reinsurer General Re, ice cream maker Dairy 
Queen, and utility MidAmerican Energy. It also owns more than 
$60 billion of stock in many large companies, such as American 
Express Co., Coca-Cola Co. and Procter & Gamble Co.. * Berkshire's share price is high, trading most of this 
year around $110,000 for a Class "A" share, because there are 
few shares outstanding. Buffett does not believe in stock 
splits, and wants to encourage long-term investing. Berkshire 
in 1996 introduced Class "B" shares valued at 1/30th of Class 
"A" shares. It has not declared a cash dividend since 1967. * Buffett tells his shareholders that he thinks of them as 
"owner-partners" and that he hopes they keep their part 
ownership in Berkshire "indefinitely." * Buffett has nearly all his net worth, estimated at $52 
billion by Forbes magazine, invested in Berkshire. He has said 
every Berkshire share he owns will go to philanthropies after 
his death. Last June, he pledged 85 percent of his net worth to 
the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and four family charities. * Despite being the world's second-richest person, Buffett 
draws an annual salary of just $100,000 to run Berkshire. * Buffett drinks five cans of Cherry Coke a day. The 
outdoor shareholder "barbecue" on May 5, Cinco de Mayo, will 
feature beef and chicken tacos, but Buffett said he'll go for 
the hamburgers. * Last August, Buffett remarried on his 76th birthday, 
wedding longtime companion Astrid Menks. * Buffett plays ukulele, and is a bridge partner of Bill 
Gates, the Microsoft Corp. chairman. Gates is also a Berkshire 
director.
