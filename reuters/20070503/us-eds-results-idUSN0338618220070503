 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Electronic Data Systems Corp. EDS.N reported on Thursday a quarterly profit that rose nearly seven-fold but issued an outlook below analyst estimates and its shares fell more than 2 percent in extended trade. 

 EDS, the No. 2 in computer services behind International Business Machines Corp. ( IBM.N ), has been boosting profits by cutting expenses, including 5,000 jobs last year, and generating revenue from contracts. Last year it signed a $3.9 billion deal to operate the U.S. Navy's computer network. Its net income advanced to $164 million, or 31 cents per share, from $24 million, or 5 cents per share, a year earlier, while revenue rose to $5.22 billion from $5.08 billion. Analysts, on average, had forecast earnings before items of 21 cents per share and revenue of $5.26 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. EDS attributed its wider operating profit margin in the first quarter and improved earnings to reaching contract milestones that had been expected to be achieved in the second quarter. It also recognized a portion of a previously disclosed contract termination payment. Chief Executive Mike Jordan said on a conference call that EDS saw "good, steady execution" in the quarter. The company drafted Jordan out of retirement in March 2003 to lead EDS when it was struggling with weak technology demand and losing market share to IBM. But EDS said it expects second-quarter earnings per share before items of 22 cents to 27 cents and revenue of $5.3 billion to $5.5 billion, and full-year earnings per share of $1.55 to $1.60 and revenue of $22.0 billion to $22.5 billion. Analysts have been forecasting second-quarter earnings of 33 cents per share before items and revenue of $5.45 billion. They expect full-year earnings per share of $1.57 before items and revenue of $22.2 billion. EDS signed $3.4 billion in contracts in the first quarter, down from $10 billion a year ago, which included $3.6 billion with General Motors Corp. and the Navy contract. The Plano, Texas-based company's debt and stock options have been active since mid-April, suggesting investors expect the company may be bought out. EDS itself has been an acquirer, agreeing in March to buy India's RelQ Software Private Ltd. and hire its 700 employees. Last June, the company bought a controlling interest in India's Mphasis BFL Ltd. ( MBFL.BO ), a software applications and business process outsourcing company, for about $352 million. In extended trade, the stock fell 2.4 percent, after rising 6 cents to close at $29.45. The stock is up 7 percent this year, partly on speculation it may be a buyout candidate. EDS shares trade at about 19 times estimated 2007 earnings per share, compared with IBM's multiple of about 15.
