 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - An internal report into a deadly explosion at BP Plc's ( BP.L ) Texas refinery sharply criticized the company's global management culture and recommended the firing of four executives, according to a copy of the report released to the media. 

 The February 2007 report, written by a team of high-level executives for BP's senior management, was released by attorneys representing some of the victims of the March 2005 explosion at BP's refinery in Texas City, Texas, WHICH killed 15 people and injured 170 more. Since the Texas City explosion and a major oil spill in Alaska in 2006, BP's operations in the United States have come under close scrutiny, including at least two criminal probes. BP executives have sought to portray the incidents as isolated, rather than symptoms of wider problems within the company. However, a congressional committee investigating the problems in Alaska said this week internal BP documents and e-mails suggested BP managers may have deliberately underspent on maintenance in an effort to meet corporate cost cutting goals. And a separate government investigation into the Texas City blast concluded that deep cost cutting ordered by BP headquarters after it acquired the refinery in a merger was partly responsible for the unsafe environment there. FIRINGS RECOMMENDED The authors of the new internal report recommended the firing of four senior refining executives, but stopped short of calling for group refining chief John Manzoni to be removed. Mike Hoffman, formerly the second highest ranking executive in BP's refining business, left the company in December. The other three managers have been reassigned and are no longer working in the refining sector, the company has said. A BP spokesman, asked about the report, said he would not discuss personnel matters. "We have read and reviewed the report and have taken the appropriate actions but, beyond that, I have no comment on the report," said BP spokesman Ronnie Chappell. The report was heavily critical of the lack of clear lines of responsibility within BP's refining business, where "there still seemed to be disputes about reporting lines even in June 2006." On a company-wide basis, BP managers routinely ignored standard procedures and often failed to act in the best interests of the company, the report said. Guidance from corporate headquarters was too often interpreted as orders and managers had "a lack of respect for audit findings" that were too often not sent to the appropriate people. Within the refining group, the corporate culture suffered from a "lack of corporate memory" and "broken" performance management systems at the highest levels, the report said. "Incompetent" workers were allowed to remain in their posts and "mavericks" who ignored standard procedures were tolerated, it added.
