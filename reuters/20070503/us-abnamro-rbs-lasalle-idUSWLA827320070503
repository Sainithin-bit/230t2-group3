 LONDON  (Reuters) - A Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ) led group is likely to proceed with a conditional bid for ABN AMRO's U.S. bank LaSalle by Sunday despite a Dutch court blocking the sale process of the unit, sources familiar with the matter said. 

 A Dutch court ruled on Thursday that ABN AAH.AS must freeze its $21 billion sale of LaSalle to Bank of America ( BAC.N ) as it should be voted on by shareholders. RBS and its partners Santander ( SAN.MC ) and Fortis FOR.BR plan to counterbid for LaSalle under a "go shop" sale period that runs until Sunday, the sources said. The offer will be conditional on them also buying the rest of ABN. The consortium plans to proceed with its offer for LaSalle as there is the threat of legal action and other complexities still surrounding the sale process following the court ruling.
