 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp. ( SBUX.O ) reported an 18.5 percent rise in quarterly earnings on Thursday, helped by hundreds of new stores and demand for new products including hot breakfast sandwiches and a sugar-free version of its popular Cinnamon Dolce latte. 

 The company also reported improved operating margins and backed its 2007 earnings forecast, sending shares up 1.4 percent in extended trading. Second-quarter net income was $150.8 million, or 19 cents per share, in-line with Wall Street analysts' average estimate, according to Reuters Estimates. In the same period last year, Starbucks earned $127.3 million, or 16 cents per share. "Starbucks reported a solid, in-line quarter and reaffirmed guidance which should be reassuring to investors," said Mike Koskuba, analyst with Victory Capital Management. "In the recent past, operating margins were lower than some investors had anticipated due to higher labor costs, commodity costs and costs associated with store openings. Now, it appears that there should be improvement in margins as we move through the year," he said. Revenue rose 19.6 percent to $2.26 billion. Analysts were expecting about $2.3 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Same-store sales, a key retail measure that tracks sales at coffee shops open at least 13 months, rose 4 percent, in-line with the company's long-term goal. Chief Executive Jim Donald said in an interview that a sale of brewing equipment, the expansion of hot breakfast sandwiches to several new markets, and strong demand for the sugar-free Cinnamon Dolce latte had helped boost sales at older stores. Operating margin was 10.7 percent of total revenue, matching the margin the company recorded in the same period last year. In the first quarter, Starbucks' operating margins had decreased from year-earlier levels. Donald said that lower store operating and general and administrative expenses had helped offset higher occupancy costs and added that he expected margins to continue to improve later this year. "We said we were going to continue to see some improvement and we did," he said. The Seattle company opened 560 stores during the quarter and plans to open a total of 2,400 this year. It currently has about 13,700 coffee shops worldwide. The company also announced a new share buyback authorization of 25 million shares. Starbucks still expects to earn between 87 cents and 89 cents per share for the year. Analysts are expecting earnings of 89 cents a share, on average. Starbucks shares were up 2.7 percent at $32.48 in after-hours trading after closing at $31.62 on Nasdaq. As of Thursday's close, the stock had dropped 10.7 percent so far this year, compared with a 5.9 percent rise in the Dow Jones U.S. restaurants and bars index .DJUSRU. Starbucks' stock has fallen this year in part due to investor concerns about profit margins that have lagged expectations, competition in the coffee market from fast-food companies such as McDonald's Corp. ( MCD.N ) and a high-profile memo in which Chairman Howard Schultz warned of the "commoditization" of Starbucks' iconic brand. The memo, leaked to the media in February, sparked worries the coffee shop chain might slow down growth and sent its share price tumbling. Management squashed that fear in March by backing its aggressive growth targets at the company's annual meeting. Still, Starbucks shares have gained less than 1 percent since the March 21 meeting.
