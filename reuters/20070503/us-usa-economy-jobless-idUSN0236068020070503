 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The number of U.S. workers filing new claims for jobless benefits fell unexpectedly by 21,000 to the lowest level of claims since January, a Labor Department report showed on Thursday. 

 Initial filings for state unemployment insurance claims slid to 305,000 in the week ending April 28 from an upwardly revised 326,000 the previous week. There were no special factors behind the drop in new claims, a Labor Department analyst told reporters. The last time initial claims were this low was for the week ending January 13, the government said. Analysts polled by Reuters were expecting a 4,000 rise in claims from the previously reported level of 321,000 in the week ending April 21. A four-week moving average of claims, which smooths weekly volatility to provide a better sense of underlying job-market trends, slipped to 328,750 from a revised 333,250 a week earlier. The total number of people still on the benefit rolls after drawing an initial week of aid declined more than expected to 2.5 million from 2.59 million in the previous week. Analysts were expecting claims to ease to 2.55 million.
