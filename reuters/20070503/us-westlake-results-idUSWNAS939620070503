 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Westlake Chemicals Corp. ( WLK.N ) said on Thursday that first-quarter profit fell, primarily due to lower selling prices for both olefin and vinyl products and to higher feedstock costs. 

 Net income dropped to $19.7 million, or 30 cents a share, from $51.3 million or 79 cents a share, a year earlier.
