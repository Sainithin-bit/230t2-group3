 DETROIT  (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers may soon deliver a contract offer to bankrupt Delphi Corp DPHIQ.PK, the chief financial officer of General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) said on Thursday, suggesting progress in years-long negotiations that GM is pressing to conclude before summer. 

 "It's still pretty complicated, but this is one where negotiations happen virtually every day," GM CFO Fritz Henderson said, adding that it would be reasonable to expect a UAW proposal soon and was confident of an eventual resolution. Delphi, which has been in bankruptcy since October 2005, needs deals with GM and its unions to complete a $3.4 billion equity financing plan to support its exit from bankruptcy. Delphi expects Cerberus Capital Management LP to withdraw as a lead investor in the plan, but other proposed investors led by Appaloosa Management LP have pledged continued support, and Henderson said others are interested. "I would say that there are a number of other parties that are interested in making an investment and helping Delphi exit bankruptcy," GM's Henderson said. Henderson told reporters that GM's goal was to conclude a deal with the UAW and Delphi before starting its own contract talks. Negotiations between U.S.-based automakers and the UAW are expected to heat up in the summer. "I think there are important parts of this matter that can be resolved in May and June," Henderson said. "We can make, expect to make and are committed to making significant progress in the next couple of months." REORGANIZATION PLAN Delphi spokesman Lindsey Williams declined to comment on Henderson's remarks. Delphi continues to work toward filing a plan of reorganization by the end of July, he said. A UAW representative could not be reached for comment. Delphi has been negotiating with former parent GM and its unions on potential relief from high labor costs it inherited from the automaker since before it filed for bankruptcy. CRT Capital Group senior analyst Kirk Ludtke said Thursday in a note that a formal response from the UAW would be encouraging and would suggest a near-term deal is still possible. UAW officials rejected as "pathetic" a contract offer from Delphi in March and began holding informational meetings with its Delphi members in April, leading to widespread speculation that the union might be preparing for a strike. A labor disruption at Delphi, GM's largest parts supplier, has been viewed as a lingering risk for GM since it has the potential to shut down the automaker's assembly lines. The Detroit New reported on Tuesday that the UAW was readying a counterproposal as soon as this week intended to break the deadlock with Delphi. GM spun Delphi off in 1999, but agreements on union benefits and other issues leave the automaker's fortunes entwined with its former parts unit. The comprehensive details that must be ironed out range from wages and benefits, to potential plant sales and closings, GM's current and future business with Delphi and possible GM financial support for long-time union employees at Delphi.
