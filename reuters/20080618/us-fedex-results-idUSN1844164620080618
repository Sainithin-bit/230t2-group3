 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Package delivery company FedEx Corp reported a quarterly loss on Wednesday citing a previously announced writedown due to its decision to change the name of FedEx Kinko's, plus record high fuel prices and the weak U.S. economy. 

 The following are comments from market participants on the results:   COMMENTS: AL MEYERS, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, AMBS INVESTMENTS "I'm disappointed, but not surprised. My first reaction is this is a very weak economy. "They're pretty conservative, but I mean this is a lot. We haven't purchased more and for the most part it's traded in a range. "We probably would not be (adding on weakness). We'll listen to the call, see what the fundamental story is and go from there." (Reporting by Nick Zieminski)
