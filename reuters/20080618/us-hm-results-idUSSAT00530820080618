 STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - Hennes & Mauritz ( HMb.ST ), the world's third-biggest clothing retailer by sales, posted second-quarter pretax profits and May sales above market expectations on Wednesday, helped by a weak U.S. dollar and good weather. 

 The company, founded in Sweden in 1947, made a pretax profit of 5.43 billion Swedish crowns ($901 million) against a mean forecast of 5.25 billion in a Reuters poll of analysts and 5.13 billion in the same period the previous year. The firm's gross margin was 62.9 percent, above analysts' forecast of 61.6 percent. "The continued weak U.S. dollar led to lower buying costs which had a positive impact on the gross margin," H&M said in a statement. "This was partly offset by a slightly higher price reduction level and increased transportation costs." Sales in May, the final month of its second quarter, were up 25 percent against an expected 20.2 percent rise, with turnover in stores open a year or more up 14 percent. The strong May sales figure came after a weak April and March, which H&M blamed on cold weather. H&M said the May sales rise "directly coincided with improved weather conditions". Analysts had expected May like-for-like sales to rise 9.2 percent, according to the mean forecast. H&M only gives whole numbers for sales development and does not provide a currency figure. H&M said that calendar effects added 3-4 percentage points to May sales with fewer sales days in June likely to have a negative effect on sales of around the same magnitude. In May last year, sales were up 10 percent with like-for-like sales down 2 percent. (Reporting by  Simon Johnson ; editing by Sue Thomas)
