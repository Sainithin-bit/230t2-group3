 (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley raised its price target on Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ) shares to $210 from $185, saying it expects the company's iPhone unit sales to double in 2009 at the new $199 price point. 

 "We believe the market generally expects a doubling of iPhone units with the lower price point ($199) and we believe this is realistic, if not conservative," the investment bank said in a note. Morgan Stanley expects 27 million iPhones to be sold in calendar year 2009 with an average revenue of $550 per unit. The investment bank said Apple's operating leverage remains understated and the mass market price and distribution of the new 3G iPhone will be a key driver of higher margin software and service revenues over time. Shares of Apple closed at $181.43 Tuesday on Nasdaq. (Reporting by Ratul Ray Chaudhuri in Bangalore; Editing by Vinu Pilakkott)
