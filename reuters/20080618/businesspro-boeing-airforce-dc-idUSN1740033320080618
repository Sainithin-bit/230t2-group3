 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Boeing Co ( BA.N ) may be forced to 
abandon its plans to sell its own tanker internationally if it 
loses its protest of the U.S. Air Force's decision to buy at 
least $40 billion worth of aerial refueling tankers from a 
competitor, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday. 

  The paper quoted Boeing's executive in charge of its tanker 
program Mark McGraw, saying that Boeing had counted on the 
Pentagon to provide enough production volume to make an 
international tanker business viable.  The Government Accountability Office is expected to decide 
on Boeing's protest as soon as Wednesday, the Journal said.  A Boeing spokesperson was not immediately available.  (Reporting by  Yinka Adegoke , Editing by Jacqueline Wong)
