 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The White House on Wednesday said it was not expecting announcements on increased oil production from a conference in Saudi Arabia between consumers and producers this weekend. 

 "No one is expecting to see announcements of increased production," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said. "We want to explain our view of how the markets are operating in terms of supply and demand, and also in terms of some things that we think would help, like transparency and greater investment in oil exploration and development around the world," he said. Those were issues that U.S. Energy Secretary Sam Bodman planned to discuss at the June 22 meeting in Jeddah, Fratto said. (Reporting by  Tabassum Zakaria ; editing by  Matthew Lewis )
