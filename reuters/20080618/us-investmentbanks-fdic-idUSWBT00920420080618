 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which oversees the resolution of failed banks, said on Wednesday it would be willing to accept similar authority over investment banks, ahead of Congressional hearings on changing how financial institutions are regulated. 

 "We wouldn't turn it down," Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Chairman Sheila Bair told reporters after renewing her call, in a speech, to set up a framework to wind down a failing investment bank, especially in light of the near-closures of U.S.-based Bear Stearns and Northern Rock in the UK. Bair said those institutions raise new questions about how to strike a balance between stability and containing risk in the financial markets while addressing concerns about moral hazard and protecting taxpayers. "The government cannot be put in the position of having to simply write a blank check when these institutions get into trouble," Bair told a group of financial professionals. Bair was referring to the move taken earlier this year by the U.S. Federal Reserve to provide discount window liquidity and a credit guarantee of $29 billion to Bear Stearns, which is being acquired by JPMorgan Chase ( JPM.N ). Bair said the Fed was forced to intervene without having a "playbook" to deal with an investment bank failure. "The Fed had to invent one on the fly," she said. The FDIC, which can tap into a $53 billion insurance fund to help depositors in case their bank fails, does not regulate investment banks, but Bair's views could help shape the debate in Congress on how to regulate them in the future. Chairman of the U.S. House Financial Services Committee Barney Frank plans to hold hearings to explore how to restructure regulation of financial institutions, including investment banks. The committee plans to hold three hearings on the matter starting in July with the heads of the Fed, Treasury Department, Securities and Exchange Commission and other federal agencies as well as market participants. The first of those hearings will focus on the events surrounding the collapse of Bear Stearns, a committee aide told Reuters. "What did the regulators know and when did they know it? What did they not know and when did they not know it?" the aide said. Bair, who has held discussions with committee staff about investment bank regulation, said it makes sense to grant that authority to a single federal regulatory agency and noted that the FDIC with its expertise would be the appropriate agency. The FDIC expects more smaller banks to fail this year as the U.S. housing industry remains in a slump with rising delinquencies and foreclosures. Although Bair has repeatedly said she does not expect any big commercial banks to fail, the FDIC on Tuesday approved rules to require about 160 of the largest banks to update their systems and procedures so that examiners can quickly save depositors. "The failure of a large bank remains highly unlikely -- and I am certainly not predicting one -- but for many it is no longer unthinkable," Bair said. The SEC is the primary regulator of the top investment banks, including Lehman Brothers LEH.N, which are an integral part of the U.S. financial system. "It seems to me the SEC or the Fed would be the logical places for prudential regulation," Bair said. Bair urged Congress to consider which agency should be the primary regulator of investment banks, as well as the process to close down a failed investment bank and any potential bridge bank structures in an orderly manner. "Housing all receivership and resolution responsibility in a single federal regulator may make sense," she said. Meanwhile, the FDIC board will soon consider proposals on how to treat a bank's derivatives and other financial contracts in case it fails, Bair said. The proposals would likely require banks to maintain specific information on so-called qualified financial contracts, she said. "We must decide whether to accept or repudiate all positions held with an individual counterparty," Bair said. (Reporting by John Poirier, editing by Mark Porter,  Leslie Gevirtz ,  Richard Chang )
