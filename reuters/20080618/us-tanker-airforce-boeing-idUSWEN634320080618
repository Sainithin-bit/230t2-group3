 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Boeing Co said on Wednesday it welcomes the U.S. Government Accountability Office ruling in favor of its protest over a $35 billion refueling tanker program, which was originally awarded to Northrop Grumman Corp and Europe's EADS. 

 "We welcome and support today's ruling by the GAO fully sustaining the grounds of our protest," said Mark McGraw, vice president of Boeing's tanker programs, in a statement. "We look forward to working with the Air Force on next steps in this critical procurement for our warfighters."
