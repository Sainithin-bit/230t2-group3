 PRAGUE  (Reuters) - Czech financial group PPF said on Wednesday it had no comment on Sanofi-Aventis's ( SASY.PA ) competing bid for Czech drugmaker Zentiva ZNTVsp.PR and that it would proceed in line with the terms of its own offer. 

 "There is a certain legal framework (of the bid) and we will proceed within that framework," PPF's spokesman Alexej Bechtin said. PPF has offered 950 crowns per share, below the 1,050 crown bid from Sanofi. (Reporting by Jana Mlochova; Editing by Quentin Bryar)
