 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - General Mills Inc ( GIS.N ) said on Wednesday it expects earnings for the recently ended fiscal year to beat expectations after a 13 percent sales gain in the fourth quarter, and its shares rose 3 percent. 

 The maker of Cheerios cereal, Progresso soup and Yoplait yogurt said it now expects earnings of about $3.52 a share before one-time items, up 11 percent from the previous year. It previously forecast $3.45 to $3.47 per share for fiscal 2008, ended May 25. Analysts' average forecast is $3.48, according to Reuters Estimates. The company's forecast excludes the impact of changes in the market value of General Mills' commodity holdings and the benefit of a favorable tax ruling. Like other food companies, General Mills has had to cope with soaring costs for commodities like wheat and energy. The company has raised prices and found a variety of ways to cut costs while still investing in marketing and product development. For 2009, it forecast earnings of $3.78 to $3.83 a share, assuming no impact from changes in the value of its commodity holdings. Analysts' average forecast is $3.79. General Mills shares stood at $62.50 in premarket trading, up from a Tuesday close at $60.73 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by  Brad Dorfman , editing by Gerald E.
