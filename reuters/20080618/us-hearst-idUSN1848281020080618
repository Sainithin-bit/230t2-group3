 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Hearst Corp Chief Executive Victor Ganzi is leaving the privately held publishing empire after working there for nearly 30 years, The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday, citing a source familiar with the matter. 

 Former CEO Frank Bennack Jr, who stepped down in 2002, is expected to succeed him, the Journal reported. Hearst officials did not return telephone calls seeking comment and the Journal did not cite a reason for Ganzi's departure. Hearst publishes magazines such as O, the Oprah Magazine and Cosmopolitan, and newspapers such as the Houston Chronicle, the Times Union in Albany, New York, and the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. Like other U.S. publishers, it is dealing with an uncertain future for print advertising as more people use the Internet to get news and information. Hearst is the majority owner of Hearst-Argyle Television. It also has interests in Walt Disney Co's ESPN and Dow Jones & Co, the Journal's owner and a unit of News Corp.
