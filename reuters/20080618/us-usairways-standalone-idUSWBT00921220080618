 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The president of US Airways Group Inc ( LCC.N ) is confident about the carrier's stand-alone prospects and does not foresee a merger in the near term. 

 Scott Kirby also told CNBC in an interview that major carriers are all but done with big cost cutting initiatives as they struggle to offset skyrocketing fuel prices. US Airways failed in May to strike a merger deal with UAL Corp UAUA.O unit United Airlines, raising concern among some experts about US Airways' future. The company has shed nearly 80 percent of its share value this year and traded down 7.6 percent on Wednesday at $3.01. Its market capitalization has slumped to roughly $275 million. Despite its deteriorating situation on Wall Street, Kirby said: "I feel great about US Airways' stand-alone prospects." (Reporting by  Richard Cowan  and  John Crawley ; editing by Carol Bishopric)
