 PRAGUE  (Reuters) - Czech generics drug maker Zentiva ZNTVsp.PR will not yet comment on a 1.7 billion euro ($2.63 billion) offer by French drug maker Sanofi ( SASY.PA ), the company said on Wednesday. 

 "We will not comment on the Sanofi bid so far but we will issue a statement later in the day, but it will probably not be by midday," Zentiva spokeswoman Vera Kudynova said. Sanofi plans to offer 1,050 crowns for each Zentiva share. Zentiva is already a subject of an existing offer from Czech financial group PPF, which has offered 950 crowns per share.
