 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc ( C.N ) has offered early retirement to the 1,350 employees of its Japanese consumer finance unit, as the subprime-hit U.S. bank retreats from consumer lending in the world's second-largest economy. 

 Citigroup made the offer on Monday in a memo distributed to employees of the unit, CFJ KK, according to Akihito Kawamura, chairman of the CFJ KK labor union. Citigroup said earlier this month it would shut its remaining 32 consumer lending outlets and 540 unmanned loan machines in Japan, following several years of scaling back the business. Employees will have until July 15 to apply for the early retirement valued at two months worth of wages, Kawamura said, adding the union did not agree with the offer. "This is beyond comprehension," Kawamura told Reuters in a telephone interview. "Employees who worked at the company for two years and those who worked for twenty years are both offered the same package." He said the union would likely press the company to increase the offer to two years worth of wages. Citigroup spokeswoman Atsuko Yoshitsugu said: "CFJ ensures employees are treated fairly and made aware of the options open to them." She declined to comment further. Japan's once-mighty consumer finance industry has been crippled by tighter regulations that have lowered maximum interest rates, and legal rulings that have forced firms to repay previous charges now deemed illegally high. Many consumer lenders fell into the red, forcing some to tie up with Japanese banks for funding. Citigroup, which has suffered more than $45 billion in write-downs and credit losses since last summer, previously said it plans to focus its resources in areas with better opportunities for growth. In 2002, the U.S. bank had 903 consumer outlets in Japan, but that had shrunk to 320 by January 2007. The remaining 32 outlets will be closed over the next 12 months, Citigroup said in a statement earlier this month. (Reporting by  Nathan Layne  and  David Dolan ; Editing by Brent Kininmont)
