 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A group of small brokerages wants to block a merger between private regulators, saying it is a backstairs way for larger firms to strip smaller companies of their power in shaping regulations. 

 Earlier this week, NYSE Group Inc. NYX.N said its regulation unit would fold its brokerage firm oversight operations into the NASD, the nation's largest private brokerage watchdog. The move is meant to reduce the cost of complying with regulatory laws for the firms that are overseen by both the NYSE and the NASD, which tend to be larger brokerages. But Richard Goble and members of his group, the Financial Industry Association, see this proposal as part of a wider problem: larger firms are supporting regulations that can be excessively burdensome for smaller brokers, to make it harder for them to survive. "The big firms are trying to grow by taking market share from the smaller guys," Goble said. Members of the NASD, which regulates all securities brokers in the United States, are entitled to vote for or against this merger, but those members may be unaware of some of the fine print in the combination, said Goble, co-founder of the Financial Industry Association. For example, smaller firms will only be able to vote for three of the 23 board positions of the merged entity, while now, members can vote for 15 of the 17 NASD board spots, Goble said. Under the current rules, large and small firms alike each have one vote, so smaller firms can theoretically elect as many as 100 percent of the available NASD board spots. Howard Schloss, a spokesman for the NASD in Washington, D.C., said the board composition was the result of negotiations with the NYSE. The NASD sought "substantial and diverse representation from the industry," and believes it achieved it, Schloss said. Goble and members of his group, the Financial Industry Association, disagree and see this proposal as part of a wider problem: larger firms are supporting regulations that can be excessively burdensome for smaller brokers. The NASD has some 5,100 members, of which about 4,600 are relatively small, with 150 brokers or less. The large firms, which have more than 500 brokers, account for 75 percent of the brokers and 80 percent of the revenue in the industry, NASD's Schloss said. A majority of members voting has to approve the merger for it to go through. Goble says, typically, about 2,000 members vote and he is hopeful his group, the Financial Industry Association, can marshal at least 1,050 votes against the merger. Goble sent out a letter asking members to vote against the rule. The NASD also plans to pay $35,000 to all of its registered firms upon closing of the deal to recognize the cost savings of the combination. But it does not make sense for smaller firms to give up so much, said Jed Bandes, president of Mutual Trust Co. Of America Securities, whose firm is a member of the Financial Industry Association. "It's just not worth it," Bandes added.
