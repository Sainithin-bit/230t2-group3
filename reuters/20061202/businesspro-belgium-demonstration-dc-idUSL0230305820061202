 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - At least 15,000 demonstrators marched 
through Brussels on Saturday in protest at planned job cuts at 
the Belgian factory of German car maker Volkswagen 

  ( VOWG.DE ).  Brussels residents and trade union members from across 
Europe, including Germany, joined almost the entire 5,000 
workforce of the affected plant, shouting "We want jobs," 
whistling, throwing firecrackers and carrying coffins.  Volkswagen announced two weeks ago it would end manufacture 
of its top-selling Golf at its plant in Brussels, reducing the 
workforce to 1,500 from some 5,000. The news prompted a strike.  A deal brokered on Friday by Belgian Prime Minister Guy 
Verhofstadt to bring production of a small new Audi to Brussels 
and save some 3,000 jobs has softened Belgian anger.  Francis Wurtz, French European parliament member and head 
of the parliament's left bloc, complained multinationals were 
making European workers fight each other and accept ever worse 
conditions.  "If we allow that to happen there will be no social Europe 
left," he said. Volkswagen will shift production of the Golf to 
Germany and is demanding Belgian workers boost productivity to 
ensure they get to make the Audi.  Hubert Gerards, a 50-year-old VW Brussels worker, came 
dressed as St Nicholas, the white-bearded figure who spawned 
Santa Claus and who gives presents to Dutch and Belgian 
children early in December.  "The bag is empty," said Gerards, who has worked 16 years 
for VW. "We have nothing on paper, only promises."  Foreign workers said they had come to show their solidarity 
with their Belgian counterparts as well as to take a stance 
against offshoring.  "I think of us as one big factory and so we should fight 
together," said Wiebke Koepsell, a 27-year-old VW worker from 
Hanover who had come with nine colleagues to Brussels.  Police estimated the crowd at the concluding speeches at 
around 15,000. Organizers said the figure was nearer 25,000.
