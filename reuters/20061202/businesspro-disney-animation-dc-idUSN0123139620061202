 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Entertainment conglomerate Walt 
Disney Co. ( DIS.N ) said on Friday it would cut jobs in its 
animation unit as it increased flexibility in the timing of 
production of its films. 

  A company source said that about 20 percent of a work force 
of about 800 animators and other workers -- roughly 160 people 
in the Southern California unit -- would be affected.  Pixar, the computer animation unit acquired by Disney, was 
seen avoiding cuts as it had an "appropriate number of 
employees," the source said.  A union representative said Disney animators expected cuts 
to be focused on production, as opposed to designers, and that 
the move reflected an industry-wide move toward hiring 
animators on a project-by-project basis rather than as 
full-time staff.  "Most of the cuts will come in the production end," said 
Animation Guild Business Representative Steve Hulett, who added 
that Disney was stretching out the period of time it took to 
make an animated film to 18 months from 12 months, requiring 
fewer staff.  Studio Chairman Dick Cook was not available for comment.  Disney in a statement said film production schedules would 
be more flexible.  "After a careful review process, the management team at 
Walt Disney Animation has determined that each film will 
dictate its own appropriate production schedule. The result of 
this necessitated a reduction in staff," it said.
