 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) dropped from 
second to fourth in the U.S. auto market in November as its 
sales slid by 10 percent, while Toyota Motor Corp.'s ( 7203.T ) 
sales surged 16 percent to put it in the No. 2 spot. 

  Overall, U.S. auto sales were weaker than expected, 
slipping to their lowest level since October 2005 and raising 
concern about whether the industry would face a slump next year 
rather than the flat market most automakers are projecting.  General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) reported 6 percent sales growth 
in November, while DaimlerChrysler AG's DCXGn.DE Chrysler 
Group posted a 3 percent rise, breaking a nine-month losing 
streak, according to the sales data released on Friday.  "Ford was a major disappointment," said Global Insight 
analyst George Magliano. "I think the economy is really 
starting to push hard against the market."  Having sold fewer cars and light trucks in November than 
DaimlerChrysler overall, Ford slashed its planned production.  Nissan Motor Co.'s ( 7201.T ) sales fell almost 2 percent and 
Hyundai Motor Co. Ltd.'s ( 005380.KS ) sales dropped almost 15 
percent. Honda Motor Co. Ltd.'s ( 7267.T ) sales rose about 1 
percent.  Industry-wide sales ran at an annualized rate of 16.04 
million units for November, short of most analysts' forecasts 
and relatively weak October sales, according to Autodata Corp.  Light-vehicle sales this year are expected to be near 17 
million units and many auto executives have said they expect 
new model launches to offset the pressure from a weakening 
housing market on consumer demand.  Toyota, the world's No. 2 automaker by output, outsold Ford 
by more than 14,000 units in November to take the No. 2 U.S. 
spot based on monthly sales for the second time this year.  Many analysts expect Toyota to keep that ranking on a more 
permanent basis in 2007 as Ford's market share slips further.  Ford's market share dropped from 16 percent a year earlier 
to 14 percent -- the bottom of the sales projection behind a 
cost-cutting program that prompted buyouts for 38,000 union 
workers, half of its factory workforce.  Toyota's market share jumped nearly 2 percentage points to 
just over 16 percent, according to Autodata.  "We're focused on returning our business to profitability 
in North America, full stop," Ford Chief Internal Sales analyst 
George Pipas said. "I wouldn't want to comment on sales 
rankings ... It's just not that important right now."  November marked the first time since 2002 that Ford slipped 
to No. 4 in U.S. sales, which happened largely because it 
decided to pull back on sales incentives, said Alex Rosten, 
industry analyst with Edmunds.com.  "They didn't launch their incentive program until 
mid-month," Rosten added. "GM and Dodge were definitely more 
aggressive in incentive spending on trucks and SUVs."  Ford said its car sales were down 3 percent, mostly due to 
lower demand from fleet customers, while truck sales were off 
13 percent. Showroom sales fell 7 percent, which Pipas called 
"disappointing." "We had our sights set higher," he said.  Ford cut planned fourth-quarter production further by 
15,000 units to 620,000 vehicles, down 22 percent from a year 
ago. It said it expects first-quarter production to be down 14 
percent to 750,000 units. Ford had said earlier production in 
the first half of 2007 would be 8 percent to 12 percent lower.
  GM SAYS LARGE SUVS, TRUCKS STABLE  GM set its first-quarter production target 9 percent lower 
than a year ago at 1.4 million vehicles.  Despite weaker industry-wide auto sales in recent months, 
GM's chief sales analyst, Paul Ballew, said the automaker still 
expected 2007 sales to hold flat from this year's total with 
sales of trucks and large SUVs holding steady.  GM reduced sales to corporate fleet customers, including 
car rental companies, by 7 percent as part of a strategy to 
move away from those low-margin deals. But November retail 
sales were up 11 percent, and Ballew said the automaker was on 
track to hit its 2006 showroom sales goal of 3 million units.  GM and Ford both offer year-end incentives to boost demand, 
but both cut incentive spending in November, analysts said.  Chrysler raised its discount offerings slightly in November 
to an industry-leading average of $4,224 per vehicle, according 
to an analysis by Edmunds.com, while Ford spent $3,326 in 
incentives per vehicle and GM spent $2,539 per vehicle.
