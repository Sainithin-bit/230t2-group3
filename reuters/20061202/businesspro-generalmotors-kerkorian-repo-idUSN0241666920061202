 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian 
sold his stake in General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) after deciding 
that he did not want to participate in a lengthy fight with 
management for control of the world's biggest car maker, 
according to a report in the Wall Street Journal. 

  "I like to gamble," the newspaper said Kerkorian told his 
adviser, Terry Christensen. "But I stop gambling when there's 
no chance to win."  Kerkorian had built up a 9.9 percent stake in GM and 
agitated for an accelerated turnaround at the company. Some 
analysts had expected him to mount a proxy fight for control of 
GM rather than cash out of his stake.  Kerkorian had been involved with GM for 19 months.  "I'm happy with it," the Journal said he told advisers 
about his investment. "Let's move on."
