 BOSTON  (Reuters) - IBM ( IBM.N ) shares fell more than 4 percent on Friday after the company's quarterly profit failed to beat some investors' forecasts and computer hardware sales lagged some targets. 

 International Business Machines Corp. reported after the market close on Thursday a fourth-quarter profit before special items of $2.26 per share. ThinkEquity analyst Eric Ross said the results were only in line with estimates after adjusting for a tax rate that was below what analysts had expected. "Investors were obviously dismayed by IBM's in-line EPS. We believe investors were expecting IBM to handily beat consensus estimates and, as a result, were disappointed," he said in a note to clients. IBM shares fell 4.7 percent to $94.77 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Before the results, the stock had gained 37 percent from a year low in July as investors raised their expectations for the company's earnings. Several brokerages broke with the consensus of investors and increased their price targets for the company's shares. Bear Stearns raised its target to $100 from $98. Citigroup increased its target to $115 from $105 in a report with the headline "Keep the faith." Merrill Lynch analyst Richard Farmer said in a research report that IBM had posted "a solid December quarter." Still he maintained his "neutral" rating on the company's shares, advising clients to hold off on buying the stock. "We prefer to wait for an entry point that reflects more investor scepticism," Farmer said.
