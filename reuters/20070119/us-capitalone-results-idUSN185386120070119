 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Capital One Financial Corp. ( COF.N ), a credit card issuer and retail bank, said on Thursday that fourth-quarter profit rose nearly 40 percent, but forecast 2007 earnings well below analyst estimates, citing a difficult banking environment. 

 The company, which entered the banking business when it bought Hibernia Corp. in 2005 and North Fork Bancorp Inc. last year, said it expected rising defaults on loans after abnormally low numbers of personal bankruptcy filings in 2006. The company's mortgage lending business could also experience pressure as the housing market slows down, Gary Perlin, the company's chief financial officer, said on a conference call. But even with these difficulties, the company's shares edged 1 percent higher in after-hours trading. "There was some fear it could have been worse," said Chris Brendler, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus in Baltimore. Capital One said net income rose to $390.7 million, or $1.14 a share, from $280.3 million, or 97 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts had on average forecast earnings of $1.24 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. The timing of Capital One's entry into the banking market may seem inopportune, analysts said: In addition to rising credit losses, long- and short-term rates are almost identical, which crimps banks' lending margins. But longer term, Capital One hopes that being in the banking business will allow it to secure cheaper funding and sell more products, analysts said. Capital One expects to earn $7.40 to $7.80 a share in 2007, which implies little growth or perhaps even a decline from 2006's full year level of $7.62 a share despite the closing in December of the company's $13.2 billion acquisition of North Fork. With the company's shares trading at a little more than 10 times their expected 2007 earnings, which is relatively low for a credit card company or regional bank, their valuation may be reasonable, Stifel's Brendler said. TROUBLE IN THE UK Capital One's credit card and consumer lending operations in the United Kingdom continued to perform poorly during the quarter, pulling net income in the global financial services segment down to $2.1 million in the fourth quarter, down from $7.1 million in the same quarter last year. Total revenue in the fourth quarter was $3.068 billion, up from $2.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2005. Capital One's shares rose 79 cents in after hours trading to $76.61. Capital One's shares fell 11 percent in 2006, while the Philadelphia KBW Bank Index .BKX rose 14 percent.
