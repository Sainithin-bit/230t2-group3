 BOSTON/CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Continuing a torrid pace of deal-making, diversified conglomerate General Electric Co. ( GE.N ) said on Thursday it will buy two of Abbott Laboratories Inc.'s ( ABT.N ) diagnostics business units for $8.13 billion in cash. 

 GE said it would buy Abbott's primary in-vitro diagnostics, which involve routine laboratory tests, and its Point-of-Care diagnostics business -- tests done typically at a patient's bedside such as blood chemistry work. Abbott's more-profitable molecular diagnostics business, including sophisticated tests for bladder cancer and susceptibility to breast cancer, and its lucrative diabetes-care businesses are not part of the transaction. "It's a really good deal for Abbott," said JP Morgan analyst Michael Weinstein, bringing the suburban Chicago company about $2 billion more from GE than he had expected. Abbott's retention of its diabetes and molecular diagnostics businesses -- the two highest growth areas in its diagnostics portfolio -- will aid the company's strategy of steadily boosting its overall profit margins, Weinstein said. Healthcare is one of GE's faster-growing businesses and an area of focus at a time there are concerns that the broader U.S. economy is slowing. The company's healthcare unit accounted for 14.2 percent of GE profits and 9.9 percent of revenue through the first nine months of 2006. GE, the world's second-largest company by market capitalization, has been quite active on the deal front through the first weeks of 2007. Including the Abbott deal, the Fairfield, Connecticut-based company has disclosed plans for $14.83 billion worth of takeovers. Its other targets this year are the aerospace business of Britain's Smiths Group Plc ( SMIN.L ) and oil and gas fields equipment maker Vetco Gray. A source had said previously that GE is in talks to sell its GE Plastics unit, which has been a drag on its results over the past year. GE has declined to comment on the possible Plastics talks. Abbott will likely use most proceeds from the deal to pay down company debt, with some of the money likely to supplement its ongoing stock-repurchase program, Abbott Chief Executive Officer Miles White told analysts in a conference call. "It's a question of maintaining flexibility and balance," White said. Lower debt will position Abbott to acquire new products -- such as new molecular diagnostics, new spinal products or even new businesses -- although Abbott currently has no acquisitions in its sights, White said. Abbott's recent purchase of businesses with high profit margins, such as Kos Pharmaceuticals, and its sale of low-margin businesses such as hospital products should fuel double-digit earnings growth in future years -- even as some products face generic competition, White said. "Abbott is focusing more and more on the pharmaceuticals business, so they may look at potential acquisitions there," as its debt is pared down, said Morningstar analyst Heather Brilliant. The Abbott deal is expected to close in the first half of 2007. The businesses GE is buying are expected to generate about $2.7 billion in revenue in 2006. GE is due to report 2006 financial results tomorrow. Analysts expect full-year revenue to come in at $162.87 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Abbott said the deal would be neutral to 2007 earnings per share before items and accretive after that. GE said the deal would be accretive to earnings. FIVE YEAR CHASE Joe Hogan, president and chief executive of GE Healthcare told Reuters GE had been pursuing the deal for five years. "We've always wanted a broader diagnostics platform," he said. "The global side of this business is growing very well." He added that while GE Healthcare is "always acquisitive," it would likely pause before seeking other deals. News of the GE/Abbott deal was disclosed after the close of normal trading. Abbott shares closed up $1.24, or 2.4 percent, to $52.79 and GE shares gained 2 cents to $38, both on the New York Stock Exchange. The GE-Abbott deal follows a similar deal last year by German conglomerate Siemens AG ( SIEGn.DE ), which bought the diagnostics division of drugs and chemicals group Bayer AG BAYG.DE for $1.86 billion.
