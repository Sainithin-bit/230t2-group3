 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oil prices jumped 3 percent on Friday, holding above the key $50 a barrel level, as temperatures fell in the U.S. Northeast, boosting fuel demand in the world's top heating fuel market. 

 U.S. crude CLc1 settled up $1.51 at $51.99 a barrel, after falling $1.76, or 3.4 percent, to $50.48 on Thursday. London Brent LCOc1 gained $1.69 to $53.44. "It could be that the market was oversold, but it looks more likely that the rise in oil, heating oil and natural gas is due to the forecast for cold weather in the coming week," said Jason Schenker, an economist for Wachovia Bank. U.S. oil prices have fallen 15 percent since the end of 2006 and about 34 percent since record highs of $78.40 struck in July. After a government report showed a rise of 6.8 million barrels in U.S. crude stocks on Thursday, U.S. crude fell below $50 for the first time since May 2005, hitting $49.90, before recovering slightly in late trade. Friday's recovery was helped by colder weather in the United States after exceptionally mild weather in the Northeast in early January sapped demand for heating fuel. Natural gas NGc1 and heating oil HOc1 futures also gained. But many analysts predicted the $50 mark would not hold for long. "The bears should now be firmly back in charge. We would not, therefore, be surprised to see rallies sold into more aggressively here, and the series of lower lows will gradually take us below the $50 level," Edward Meir of Man Energy said in his daily report. "It has been a wild ride lower thus far and the bottom still seems elusive." Technical analysts, who predict future price direction from studying charts, said that, if there were a convincing break below $50, the next key level would be around $44.50 -- a 50 percent retracement of the rally from the December 1998 low of $10.35 to last July's record. PIVOTAL POINT Some commentators have said a concentration of "put," or sell, options around the $50 and $45 level could trigger deep selling. Countering that, producers, who have been relying on a rising market to protect their revenues, have started to buy oil futures to hedge their output and investment projects against further price declines. Other analysts say the $50 barrier may be more formidable than it appears at first sight. The U.S. front-month February contract CLG7, which expires on Tuesday, was relatively close to $50 Friday. But March CLH7 crude, which will become the front month, was trading at $53. "The bulls might get a temporary relief when February WTI goes off the board on Monday, because March is trading a $1.50 higher," Nauman Barakat, senior vice president at Macquarie Futures USA, said in a morning note. In addition, long-term investors, who view commodities as an important diversifier against falls in other asset classes, increasingly see an opportunity to buy. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has agreed on two production cuts totaling 1.7 million barrels per day, but has failed to implement them fully. In its monthly report, the producer group said the 10 OPEC members involved in supply curbs had pumped 26.8 million bpd in December, 111,000 bpd less than in November, but still above a 26.3 million bpd target. nL19562731 (Additional reporting by Colin Wooster and  Barbara Lewis  in London and  Fayen Wong  in Sydney)
