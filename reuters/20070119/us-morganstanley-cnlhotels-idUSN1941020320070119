 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) unit is to buy real estate investment trust CNL Hotels & Resorts Inc. for about $4.2 billion, including debt, to take control of eight luxury hotels, the companies said on Friday. 

 CNL Hotels, whose shares are not publicly traded, also said it would sell its remaining 51 properties to Ashford Hospitality Trust ( AHT.N ), another real estate investment trust, for about $2.4 billion in cash immediately before its transaction with Morgan Stanley. The deals, coming after a series of acquisitions in the sector, signal that some investors are willing to bet that the hotel industry -- which has boomed over the past few years -- will continue to grow and deliver steady profits. "There is a ton of capital out there that needs to find a home in real estate," Deutsche Bank analyst Chris Woronka said. "These hotels are growing revenue and cash flow at significantly higher levels relative to the other asset classes." Morgan Stanley Real Estate, part of the investment bank's fixed-income division, will pay $20.50 per share in cash for CNL Hotels, the REIT said in a statement. CNL Hotels, which in the past had considered going public, was widely expected to sell its assets, Woronka said. "I don't think it was a surprise to the market." The purchase includes three properties run under Hilton Hotels Corp.'s HLT.N luxury Waldorf-Astoria collection, including the Arizona Biltmore Resort & Spa in Phoenix, Arizona. It will also get resorts branded as high-end Marriott International Inc. MAR.N chains, including properties in Orlando, Miami and Phoenix. "We believe that these types of luxury hotels are extremely hard to replicate and will exhibit excellent future growth," Morgan Stanley Real Estate Managing Director Michael Franco said in a statement. Morgan spokeswoman Alyson D'Ambrisi declined to give further details on the transaction, including how much debt the company would assume, because the deal has not yet been completed. Ashford said it would buy 24 full-service and 27 select-service hotels from CNL Hotels under the deal, more than doubling the number of rooms in its portfolio. "It makes them a whole lot bigger, and it diversifies the portfolio in a number of different directions," Robert W. Baird & Co. analyst David Loeb said. "Ashford does have a history of squeezing value out of portfolio transactions, and I expect they will from this one as well." The deal is expected to add 35 cents per share on an annualized basis in the first year to Ashford's funds from operations (FFO), a key measure of REITs' profitability. But Ashford also plans to lower its debt, partly through asset sales, that would likely decrease the boost to FFO, Loeb added. Ashford said it plans to invest about $55 million in capital improvements at the properties in the first year of its ownership. Wachovia Securities is providing Ashford with debt and equity financing for the deal. Ashford bought 30 select-service hotels from CNL Hotels for $465 million in June 2005. The boards of the respective companies have approved the deals, which are expected to close in the second quarter. CNL Hotels also said it would close a previously announced deal to sell 32 assets to an affiliate of Whitehall Street Global Real Estate Limited Partnership 2005 for $405 million in the first quarter. Whitehall Street is a unit of Goldman Sachs  ( GS.N ). Morgan Stanley Real Estate has been snapping up commercial and residential properties worldwide, making $24.6 billion in purchases in the first nine months of 2006 on top of $22 billion in 2005. It has also turned its attention to hotels in recent years. In July it acquired seven European hotels from Intercontinental Hotels Group ( IHG.L ) for $812.4 million, and late last year formed a platform to acquire and manage hotel properties across Europe. In the United States, it purchased a Burbank, California, hotel from Hilton for $125 million in November. As of September 30, it managed funds with $60.5 billion in assets worldwide on behalf of the company and outside investors. Ashford's shares were up 24 cents, or 2 percent, at $12.28, while Morgan Stanley was up 42 cents, or 0.5 percent, at $81.63, both during midday trading at the NYSE.
