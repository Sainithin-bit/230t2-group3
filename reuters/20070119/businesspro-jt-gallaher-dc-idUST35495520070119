 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan Tobacco ( 2914.T ) has bought about 
1.46 percent of takeover target Gallaher Group Plc's GLH.L 
shares this week as the British cigarette maker's share price 
fell below its bid price, the Nikkei newspaper reported on 
Friday. 

  The Nikkei said Japan Tobacco had bought more than 3 
million shares per day between Monday and Wednesday from the 
market in a bid to reduce its acquisition costs and lessen the 
chances of another firm making a play for Gallaher.  In the biggest-ever foreign acquisition by a Japanese 
company, Japan Tobacco agreed in December to pay 11.4 pounds in 
cash per share for Gallaher, valuing it at 7.5 billion pounds 
($14.81 billion) or 9.75 billion pounds including debt.  Japan Tobacco intends to buy about 5 percent of Gallaher's 
outstanding stock on the market, the paper said.
