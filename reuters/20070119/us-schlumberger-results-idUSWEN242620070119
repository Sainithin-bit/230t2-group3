 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - Schlumberger Ltd. ( SLB.N ) said on Friday that quarterly earnings rose 71 percent on a strong performance in its unit that finds and measures oil and gas reserves, and the world's largest oilfield services company forecast significant growth for 2007. 

 Investors sent Schlumberger shares up more than 4 percent. Recent declines in crude oil and natural gas prices had raised concerns that the 2-1/2 year surge in spending by oil and companies could begin winding down. Schlumberger said the era of cheap energy prices had ended, and higher levels of investment were needed to secure supplies. Fourth-quarter income from continuing operations rose to $1.13 billion, or 92 cents per share, from $660 million, or 54 cents per share, a year earlier. The earnings easily topped analysts' average forecast of 85 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Schlumberger Chief Executive Andrew Gould also offered investors reassurance on the near-term health of the natural gas drilling market in the United States, telling analysts on a conference call that the company had not seen any weakness in its business. "I think the weakness, if it comes, coincides with the end of winter." Gould said. "That's when people are going to make decisions." As a result, he told analysts that Schlumberger would not make a call on the likelihood of stabilization or decline in U.S. gas drilling until the end of February. "Everyone has been quite concerned about North American drilling weakness as a result of softening natural gas prices, and he pretty much said they had not seen any weakness," Simmons & Co. analyst Bill Herbert said. Gould also said the company expected significant growth in 2007, especially in the Eastern Hemisphere. Revenue for the quarter rose 33 percent to $5.35 billion from $4.02 billion. "It was another very solid quarter," said Calyon Securities analyst Mark Urness. "The big upside again was at Western Geco, which shows future exploration activity is going to be up a lot." At Western Geco, Schlumberger's fast-growing seismic unit that clients hire to measure oil and gas reserves, pretax operating profits jumped to $273 million from $110 million a year earlier as revenues increased to $721 million from $464 million. Pretax profit at the oilfield services unit rose to $1.32 billion from $852 million, while revenue was up to $4.63 billion from $3.57 billion. Schlumberger shares were up $2.57, or 4.4 percent, at $60.47 in morning New York Stock Exchange trade. So far this year, the stock is down 4.5 percent, compared with a 6 percent decline in the Philadelphia Oil Services index .OSX. (Additional reporting by  Matt Daily )
