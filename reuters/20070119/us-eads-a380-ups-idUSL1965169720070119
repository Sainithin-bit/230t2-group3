 PARIS  (Reuters) - Airbus could soon be without a single order for the freighter version of its troubled A380 superjumbo, a market the planemaker only recently said held demand for 400 planes. 

 French newspaper Les Echos reported on Friday that United Parcel Service Inc. ( UPS.N ), the world's largest package delivery firm, is expected to cancel the only remaining order -- for 10 of the planes -- next week. It did not identify its sources for the story. Asked on Wednesday whether UPS was poised to dump the plane, top Airbus salesman John Leahy said: "They are deciding that as we speak." On Friday, a spokeswoman for Airbus asked about the newspaper report said: "I have no information along that line." Airbus is owned by European aerospace group EADS  ( EAD.PA ) A spokesman for UPS said on Friday there was "no change to the situation," and that the company was still reviewing its order. In October UPS set up a team to evaluate its $2.5 billion freighter purchase after Airbus announced a third delay in A380 production due to wiring problems. Talk of cancellations is a further blow for Airbus, which this week revealed its 2006 overall orders total fell behind archrival Boeing Co. ( BA.N ) for the first time since 2000. The numbers revealed Airbus' weakness in freighters, as Boeing took orders for 81 while Airbus won none. This July, Airbus plans to deliver the last of its only freighter model, the 35-year-old A300/A310, while the company has announced plans build a freight version of the A330-200. Tom Williams, executive vice-president for Airbus programs, said on Thursday that whatever happened the planemaker would not entirely end its development work on a freighter version of the A380. STEPPING STONE Analysts say the project is a stepping stone to offering a stretched version of the A380 airliner which could seat 1,000 passengers. Airbus could announce it will await better times for it to produce a cargo version, Les Echos said. UPS rival FedEx Corp. ( FDX.N ) canceled an order for 10 A380 freighters citing delays which have put the project two years behind schedule. It bought Boeing's 777 freighter instead. Two other firms -- airline Emirates EMAIR.UL and aircraft lessor International Lease Finance Corp. ( AIG.N ) -- have converted A380 freighter orders to passenger versions. Wiring installation problems have delayed deliveries of the double-decker, with the first now due for delivery in late 2007 to Singapore Airlines ( SIAL.SI ). The project on Wednesday prompted the third profit warning in less than a year from Airbus parent firm EADS. Airbus' long-term market forecast issued just two months ago called for demand for more than 400 very large freighters by 2025. If the A380 freighter is shelved, its hopes will be pinned in the interim on the smaller A330-200F twin-engined freighter due in the second half of 2009. Shares in EADS rose 1.25 percent to 24.37 euros. Malaysia on Thursday lifted the threat of canceling an order for six A380 airliners for national carrier Malaysian Airline System Bhd ( MASM.KL ).
