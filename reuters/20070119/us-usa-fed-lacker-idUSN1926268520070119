 RICHMOND, Virginia  (Reuters) - The main risk to the U.S. economy is for inflation to surge again or not subside, and more data is needed to confirm tentative signs of moderating price pressures, Richmond Federal Reserve Bank President Jeffrey Lacker said on Friday. 

 "The risk that core inflation surges again, or does not subside as desired, clearly remains the predominant macroeconomic policy risk," Lacker said in a speech on the economic outlook. "The November inflation reports ... have provided some tentative evidence suggesting a moderating trend," he said, but added it would take several months of data for it to be convincing evidence. Lacker, a non-voting member of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee this year, has dissented in the last four meetings against keeping interest rates steady, arguing for a quarter percentage-point increase in benchmark rates to keep inflation concerns contained. The FOMC next meets on January 30-31 and policymakers are widely expected to keep the fed funds rate at 5.25 percent. Lacker later said there have been some good numbers on core inflation recently but it was not clear if it was a temporary dip from falling energy prices in the summer. He also said such data had not convinced him yet to change his expectations on prices. "I am not quite sure if I've changed my mind of where inflation is going to be the first half of this year," he told reporters after the speech. He also said he was not entirely happy where inflation expectations have been. In his speech, Lacker noted the Fed's generally preferred measure of inflation -- the core personal consumption expenditures price index -- had fallen to 1.8 percent in November on a three-month average rate of change. That would be in the Fed's supposed comfort range of around 1 to 2 percent, but Lacker said the data had often oscillated in the past. He also said he did not share the view that robust wage growth would be a cause of inflationary pressures, as long as productivity growth was strong. OIL PRICES A RISK In answering a question from the audience after the speech, Lacker said surges in oil prices materialized later in core inflation and that fluctuations in oil prices were a very present risk for the economy. U.S. crude soared to a record $78.40 last year, but have tumbled 17 percent since the end of last year. It was holding above $50 on Friday. Data on Thursday showed core consumer prices rose 2.6 percent in 2006. Lacker reiterated he expected economic growth, as measured by gross domestic product, to head higher. "Growth will start the year on the low side, but should be back to about 3 percent by the end of the year," and average between 2.5 and 2.75 percent in 2007, he said. A tight labor market and solid wage growth would keep consumer spending strong, which along with business investment would continue to offset the drag from the housing market. A risk to the outlook, in addition to oil prices, would be a further deterioration in the housing market. But he said there were signs that demand for housing has stabilized, and that weakness in housing was unlikely to be enough of a drag to tip the economy into recession. Excess inventory of homes for sale suggests home building will be below demand for several more months, but he expected housing starts to realign with sales around the middle of 2007. The Commerce Department reported on Thursday a 4.5 percent jump in December housing starts, a second straight monthly increase that ran contrary to analysts' expectations. Lacker warned against using the inverted yield curve on U.S. treasury bonds as a signal of an economic downturn. "I would caution against taking it as a crude measure of recession," he said, adding long-term rates were low from stable price expectations and a global savings glut.
