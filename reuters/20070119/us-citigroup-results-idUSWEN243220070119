 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc. ( C.N ) said on Friday fourth-quarter profit rose a greater-than-expected 3 percent as revenue increased in all major business lines, but growth lagged major rivals as expenses soared. 

 Earnings from continuing operations rose to $5.13 billion, or $1.03 per share, from $4.97 billion, or 98 cents, despite a 14 percent decline from investment banking and 8 cents per share of charges for its Japanese consumer finance unit. Profit topped the average analyst forecast by 2 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 15 percent to $23.83 billion, topping the average $22.7 billion estimate. Costs, a major investor concern, surged 23 percent to $13.96 billion. Chief Executive Charles Prince said that excluding items, expenses rose roughly as fast as revenue. "Expenses remain front and center," said Jim Russell, director of core equity strategy at Fifth Third Asset Management in Cincinnati, which invests $22 billion and owns Citigroup shares. "I'm impressed with the top-line revenue growth." Citigroup shares closed up 11 cents at $54.50 on the New York Stock Exchange. Profit rose less than the 48 percent and 68 percent that JPMorgan Chase & Co. ( JPM.N ) and Merrill Lynch & Co. MER.N reported this week, respectively, and growth that major Wall Street investment banks posted last month. Return on equity was 17.2 percent, the lowest in 10 quarters. New Chief Operating Officer Robert Druskin is looking for ways to cut costs. Prince said Druskin's review will end by March and focuses on "structural" matters such as consolidating offices and operations, or moving employees. "We as a company have some easy decisions to make, but not a lot," Chief Financial Officer Sallie Krawcheck said in an interview. Meanwhile, Prince is spending more to boost the largest U.S. bank's international presence. He said it's tough to do this and simultaneously satisfy investor demands to cut costs and post consistently good quarterly results. "It's not easy; it's not fast; it's certainly not glamorous," Prince said on a conference call. Spending now to add profit later "is a continuation of a pattern that investors have not particularly embraced," wrote Merrill Lynch analyst Guy Moszkowski. "We dare to believe 2007 will be different." Results included $415 million of charges to boost reserves and close most consumer finance branches in Japan after a new law limited interest rates it could charge. Net income fell 26 percent from $6.93 billion a year earlier, when the bank sold its asset management unit for a $2.1 billion gain. Citigroup also raised its quarterly dividend 10 percent to 54 cents per share from 49 cents. INTERNATIONAL CONSUMER STRUGGLES The consumer unit boosted profit 7 percent to $2.61 billion and revenue 9 percent to $12.88 billion as growth and credit quality improvements in the United States offset a downturn in international results. U.S. consumer profit rose 48 percent and revenue rose 14 percent from weak year-earlier levels. Prince said he remained "cautiously optimistic" about the long-struggling U.S. unit, despite a credit "headwind" that will persist throughout 2007. "We cannot have 40 percent of the company with no real revenue dynamic to it," he said. In contrast, international consumer profit sank 43 percent, hurt by Japan, credit losses in Mexico, and spending. Expenses rose 24 percent, and revenue just 2 percent. "I expect a much better relationship between revenues and expenses" in 2007, Prince said. Corporate and investment banking profit fell to $1.75 billion from $2.05 billion a year earlier, when results benefited from a one-time gain and a release of reserves. Revenue rose 14 percent to $7.08 billion, helped by a 32 percent increase in fixed-income trading revenue and record fees from advising on mergers and underwriting stocks and bonds. Compensation jumped 37 percent. Prince has begun making acquisitions. Last quarter, Citigroup agreed to buy Central America's Grupo Cuscatlan for $1.51 billion and pay $3.1 billion for a 20 percent stake in Turkey's Akbank, and led a consortium that won control of China's Guangdong Development Bank for $3.1 billion. "Over a few years, you should see huge growth from that investment," said Amit Kumar, an analyst at Minneapolis' FAF Advisors Inc., which invests $98 billion and owns Citigroup shares. Wealth management profit, including the Smith Barney brokerage and private bank, rose 38 percent to $411 million. Profit from alternative investments rose 56 percent to $549 million. Assets rose 26 percent to $1.88 trillion. (Additional reporting by  Joseph A. Giannone  and  Dan Wilchins )
