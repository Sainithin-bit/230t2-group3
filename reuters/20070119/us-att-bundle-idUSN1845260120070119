 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - AT&T Inc. said on Friday it will let subscribers who pay at least $110 a month make unlimited calls between their mobile and home phones, as it moves to stop customers from defecting to cable rivals. 

 The service, dubbed AT&T Unity, is offered as a perk to subscribers who pay for both the $50 a month unlimited local and long-distance calling plan for their home or business and the $59.99 a month unlimited wireless plan. AT&T, which brought Cingular Wireless under one roof through its purchase of BellSouth Corp., plans to bundle wireless and fixed-line services to compete against cable TV providers, which now also offer telephone and Internet services. Ralph de la Vega, president of AT&T's regional wireline business, which operates 68 million telephone lines in 22 states, expects the offer to reduce customer cancellations, known as churn, and help attract new customers. "You can take it to the bank that churn is lower, that customers are happier," de la Vega said in a phone interview. AT&T said roughly half of Cingular's 58.7 million wireless customers already use AT&T's land-line services. The company plans to market the new option in Cingular stores throughout the wireline operating region. But Forrester Research analyst Charles Golvin said the offer may have just a limited appeal, say to subscribers of wireless family plans, who tend to use up a lot of minutes calling home from multiple phones. "Because they have such a large footprint, the value proposition to a customer is greater, but I think it's only a certain segment to whom this will be really compelling," said Golvin. He said AT&T is the biggest U.S. service to offer such a service bundle, but noted smaller regional provider Qwest Communications International Inc. also gives customers unlimited calls between their home phone and cell phone. Golvin said the service may help AT&T compete with cable companies, which do not have their own wireless services. Several top U.S. cable companies have formed a joint venture with Sprint Nextel Corp., the No. 3 U.S. wireless provider, to add wireless to their service packages, but they are still testing combined offerings in a few markets. "It's going to blow them away. Cable can't touch this," said de la Vega, who until recently was the chief operating officer for Cingular Wireless, the No. 1 U.S. mobile service, which is now being rebranded as AT&T. De la Vega said other services such as high-speed Internet and AT&T's emerging television service would also become part of service bundles in the future.
