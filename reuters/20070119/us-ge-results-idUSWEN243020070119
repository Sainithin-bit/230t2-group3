 BOSTON  (Reuters) - General Electric Co. ( GE.N ) said on Friday that fourth-quarter profit rose at all units, but GE Industrial, which was hurt by poor plastics performance. 

 The conglomerate, whose operations range from jet engines to commercial lending, said it may put the plastics unit up for sale and that it had overstated past earnings dating back to 2001 by a total of $343 million as a result of flawed accounting for interest rate swaps. For months, investors have been wondering when GE would move to divest its plastics business. Fourth-quarter net income totaled $6.58 billion, or 64 cents per share, compared with $3.16 billion, or 30 cents per share, a year earlier. Earnings were in line with the forecasts of analysts polled by Reuters Estimates. GE, the world's second-largest company by market capitalization after Exxon Mobil Corp. ( XOM.N ), said revenue rose 11 percent to $44.62 billion. Profit at the industrial unit, which in addition to plastics makes products including light bulbs and appliances, fell 12 percent to $673 million. "We're seeing exactly why the company made a decision to divest the plastic unit, because the industrial performance is just not good," said Peter Smith, an analyst at Morningstar. "That just serves as evidence for why the company has been so active in the (mergers and acquisitions) market." In the past two weeks, Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE has disclosed plans for $14.83 billion worth of acquisitions, including some units of Abbott Laboratories Inc. ( ABT.N ), the aerospace business of Britain's Smiths Group Plc ( SMIN.L ) and Houston-based oil and gas fields equipment maker Vetco Gray. "When you see me do $15 billion in two weeks, some of you may say, 'Is he crazy?'" Jeff Immelt, GE chairman and chief executive, said on a conference call with analysts. "But this is all part of a five-year, disciplined, diligent, long-term focus on the company." GE shares fell 76 cents, or 2 percent, to $37.24 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares have risen 5.8 percent since the start of the fourth quarter, compared with a 7.4 percent rise in the Dow Jones Industrial average  .DJI , of which GE is a component. REVIEWING PLASTICS The plastics business has been a weak spot for GE for the past year, hurt by the high price of key raw material benzene. "We are currently reviewing the potential disposition of our plastics business," Immelt said. Analysts have said the unit could fetch up to $10 billion, with potential buyers, including private equity players or chemicals companies such as BASF AG BASF.DE, Dow Chemical Co. ( DOW.N ) and Saudi Arabia's Saudi Basic Industries Corp.  2010.SE. Immelt said GE would stick to its plan to buy back $5 billion to $7 billion of stock this year, but the repurchases will begin in earnest only after the plastics sale closes, which the company expects in the second half of the year. GE said profit rose 5 percent at NBC Universal media after a year of declines, although analyst Nigel Coe of Deutsche Bank described the growth as "a touch weaker" than expected. GE said it would restate its results for 2001 through 2005 and for the first nine months of 2006, adjusting for its past accounting for interest-rate swaps, which the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission determined did not meet certain requirements. GE expects first-quarter earnings of 43 cents to 45 cents per share, which it said would reflect growth of 8 percent to 13 percent over year-earlier results. "That's double-digit growth and when you look at the S&P it's only growing at about 6 percent," said Thomas Leritz, portfolio manager at Argent Capital Management in Clayton, Missouri. Leritz follows GE, but does not own GE shares. (Additional reporting by  Ben Klayman  in Chicago and  Emily Chasan  in New York)
