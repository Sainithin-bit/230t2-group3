 PARIS  (Reuters) - French electrical engineering group 
Schneider Electric ( SCHN.PA ) on Friday reported its 2006 
fourth-quarter sales rose 12.3 percent to 3.664 billion euros, 
beating an average forecast in a Reuters Estimates poll of 
3.481 billion euros. 

  In a financial notice in the La Tribune newspaper, the 
group said it was confident that in 2007 it could beat the 
sales growth target of its 'New2' business plan, without giving 
details.  In the advertisement, Scheider said full-year sales rose 
17.6 percent with a like-for-like gain of 10.7 percent. This 
would take the full-year figure to 13.73 billion euros against 
expectations of 13.547 billion euros ($17.54 billion)  Chief Executive Jean-Pascal Tricoire was quoted as saying 
that the strong like-for-like sales growth of the past three 
years showed the success of its growth model based on 
geographical expansion and innovative technologies and the 
integration of new activities.  "Under the current economic circumstances, the group is 
confident in its capacity to generate in 2007 a like-for-like 
sales growth superior to the target in the New2 business plan," 
he said.  The Schneider Electric website was down for maintenance.  In October, Schneider increased its 2006 like-for-like 
sales growth target to 10 percent from 9 percent, and added 
operating income was expected to rise by 25 percent. But it 
said at the time 2007 sales growth would be below that of 2006.  Schneider said demand was solid in all regions.  The range of forecasts for full-year sales was from 12.419 
billion euros to 13.698 billion euros.  The group is planning a 1.2 billion euro capital increase 
by March.  Schneider announced the capital increase last October after 
it said it planned to acquire American Power Conversion Corp 
APCC.O.  APC shareholders on January 16 voted to accept the 
acquisition for roughly $6.1 billion.  Tricoire at the time said the APC buy would extend its hold 
in the uninterrupted power supply market and would be a 
platform for further growth, while his finance director said 
the group was still considering making smaller acquisitions of 
500 million to 800 million euros per year in the next two to 
three years.  Schneider operates via a number of brands such as Merlin 
Gerlin, Square D and Telemecanique.
