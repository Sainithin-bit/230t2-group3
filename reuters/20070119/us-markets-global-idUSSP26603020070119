 LONDON  (Reuters) - Stock markets in Asia and Europe dipped on Friday as worries about technology sector earnings offset optimism about the health of the world economy, while oil prices hovered near 20-month lows around $50 a barrel. 

 The yen was stuck near a four-year low against the dollar as the Bank of Japan's decision on Thursday to leave interest rates unchanged at 0.25 percent condemned it to a further period as an ultra-low yielding currency. "The credibility of the BOJ has been somewhat tarnished as the market came round to the idea of a hike and then we started to get leaks through the Japanese media and political pressure from the government," Rabobank markets strategist Jeremy Stretch said. "Although the BOJ may well argue that they are being prudent and cautious, that has underpinned the view that the yen is in a slightly different range ... there is every reason to suggest you want to be short yen and utilize that for carry trades." The dollar was little moved against the yen at 121.27  JPY= , having hit a four-year high at 121.59 on Thursday, while the euro was up 0.1 percent at 157.35 yen EURJPY=. The euro was little changed at $1.2966. Liquidity, fueled in part by the carry trade of borrowing low cost yen to invest in other higher returning currencies, has propped up asset markets around the world, keeping stocks near multi-year, if not record, highs. STOCKS EASE European stocks dipped from this week's six-year peaks, with the FTSEurofirst 300 .FTEU3  down 0.4 percent to 1,503.8 points. Declines were led by technology shares such as SAP ( SAPG.DE ) and Infineon ( IFXGn.DE ), which eased on the back of a poor performance by U.S. peers overnight. Shares in IBM ( IBM.N ) fell 2 percent in after-hours trade after the world's largest technology services company posted earnings which failed to impress investors. That followed disappointing outlooks from Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ) and semiconductor equipment maker Lam Research ( LRCX.O ). In Tokyo, the Nikkei average  .N225  closed down 0.35 percent at 17,310.44 points as the tech weakness weighed. Shares elsewhere in Asia also struggled with MSCI's index of stocks outside Japan .MSCIAPJ shedding 0.3 percent. "The tech earnings are not good. Investors prefer to take profits instead of sitting around worrying," said Cho Seong-joon, analyst at Meritz Securities in Seoul, where Hynix Semiconductor ( 000660.KS ) fell nearly 5 percent. Energy stocks were also pressured by ongoing weakness in the price of oil. U.S. light crude CLc1 steadied after tumbling to $49.90 a barrel, its lowest since May 2005, after data on Wednesday showed a big build in U.S. fuel supplies. "Traders are unlikely to be satisfied with the brief dip below the $50 level last night. We suspect a bigger drop will be required," said Tobin Gorey at Australia's Commonwealth Bank. DATA STRONG A lower oil price could provide another boost for the global economy, which recent data suggest has been running better than previously expected of late. U.S. manufacturing, housing and employment data on Thursday were all on the firm side and European data have been solid. As evidence mounts that the feared U.S. slowdown is likely to prove shallow and short-lived, it has raised the prospect that global monetary policy will remain tighter for longer than previously expected. The Bank of England surprised markets by raising interest rates to 5.25 percent last week, a move most economists said was justified by subsequent data showing UK inflation reached 3 percent last month. Bank of England policymaker Timothy Besley said on Friday the central bank's Monetary Policy Committee would do whatever it takes to get inflation back to its 2 percent target. "One of the concerns of the MPC at all points is with second round effects going from inflation through to wage settlements, Besley said in a newspaper interview. Friday Figures showing British retail sales jumped by 1.1 percent in December, the fastest monthly climb in 18 months, will have added to the bank's concerns. Euro zone government bonds rose as buyers finally saw some value after a six-week sell-off dragged prices to six-month lows. The March Bund future <FGBLH7 >was up 30 ticks at 115.46.
