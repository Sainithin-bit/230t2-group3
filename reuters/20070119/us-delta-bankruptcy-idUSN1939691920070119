 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bankrupt Delta Air Lines Inc. DALRQ.PK is studying a $10.2 billion takeover bid by rival US Airways Group Inc. ( LCC.N ) and will take it to its board of directors soon, according to a court filing on Friday. 

 The Atlanta-based airline rejected a November 15 takeover offer from US Airways, prompting the rival to increase its bid by about 20 percent earlier this month. In the filing, the airline reiterated that it will consider the increased bid as it is obligated to do, but still intended to exit bankruptcy as an independent airline. "Delta's management and advisors are currently evaluating the revised US Airways proposal, in anticipation of making a further presentation to Delta's Board of Directors in the near future," the airline said in a revised disclosure statement, which details its plan of reorganization. The No. 3 U.S. carrier, which has been operating under bankruptcy protection since September 2005, continued to pursue its own plan to exit Chapter 11 as an independent carrier and recommended that creditors vote for it. Under its own plan, the airline projected 62 percent to 78 percent recovery for certain unsecured holders of impaired claims, or debt that would not be repaid in full. For its Comair subsidiary, it projected 76 percent to 100 percent recoveries for such creditors. Delta assumes that unsecured creditors hold about $14.2 billion in claims, and about $800 million against Comair. "Any alternative to confirmation of the plan, such as liquidation, partial sale of assets or any attempt by another party in interest to file a plan, would result in lower recoveries for stakeholders, as well as significant delays, litigation and costs," it said in the filing. Holders of at least two-thirds in dollar amount and more than one-half in number of impaired claims must approve the plan. The court also needs to approve any plan.
