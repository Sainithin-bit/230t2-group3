 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Asian stocks fell on Friday with technology shares pressured by weakness in their U.S. peers following disappointing outlooks from sector heavyweights including Apple Inc. ( AAPL.O ) 

 IBM ( IBM.N ) added to the disappointment for the sector with quarterly results that did not top estimates by as much as investors had hoped for. Shares in the world's largest technology services company fell in extended trading. Following a 3.86 percent drop in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index .SOXX, Asian chip shares including South Korea's Samsung Electronics ( 005930.KS ), Hynix Semiconductor ( 000660.KS ), Japan's Advantest Corp. ( 6857.T ) and Tokyo Electron ( 8035.T ) all lost ground. "When U.S. chip makes drop nearly 4 percent, that is quite negative for global tech shares," said Choo Hee-yeop, deputy general manager of asset management strategy at Korea Investment and Securities. By 0011 GMT, Toyko's Nikkei average  .N225  had lost 0.36 percent as chip-tester maker Advantest shed 2.45 percent and Tokyo Electron, the world's second-largest supplier of tools to make microchips, fell 3.16 percent. Energy firm INPEX Holdings ( 1605.T ) dipped 1.38 percent after oil slid below $50 a barrel on Thursday for the first time since May 2005 after sharp increases in U.S. crude supply. Oil CLc1 was at $50.33 in early Asian trade. Also pressured, South Korea's key KOSPI  .KS11  shed 1.19 percent as Samsung Electronics fell 2.18 percent and Hynix Semiconductor dropped 3.10 percent. In Australia, falls of 1.64 percent for oil producer Woodside Petroleum ( WPL.AX ), 2.42 percent for oil explorer Oil Search ( OSH.AX ) and 0.20 percent for diversified miner BHP Billiton ( BHP.AX ) dragged the key S&P/ASX 200 index .AXJO down 0.33 percent. But takeover target Mayne Pharma MYP.AX climbed 0.25 percent after U.S. hospital products firm Hospira Inc. ( HSP.N ) won conditional approval from U.S. antitrust authorities for its $2 billion merger deal. MSCI's measure of Asian stocks excluding Japan .MSCIAPJ eased 0.27 percent, falling from a two-week closing high. On Wall Street, U.S. blue chips  .DJI  edged 0.07 percent lower while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  dropped 1.46 percent on Thursday.
