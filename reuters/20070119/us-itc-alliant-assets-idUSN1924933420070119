 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - ITC Holdings Corp. ( ITC.N ) said on Friday it would buy the transmission assets of Alliant Energy Corp.'s ( LNT.N ) Interstate Power and Light Co. unit for about $750 million. 

 ITC said the purchase by its newly created subsidiary, ITC Midwest LLC, would add to earnings immediately and increase its earnings-per-share growth over the next five to seven years. Interstate Power and Light's assets consist of about 6,800 miles of transmission lines in Iowa, Minnesota and Illinois. ITC Holdings expects the transaction to close in the fourth quarter. Net proceeds to Alliant from the sale are estimated at $475 million to $525 million. (Additional reporting by Christopher Kaufman)
