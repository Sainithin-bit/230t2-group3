 KANSAS CITY  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve officials warned on Friday that inflation was still too high, reinforcing views the U.S. central bank will keep interest rates steady unless the economic outlook takes an unexpected turn. 

 "Monetary policy from my perspective right now is modestly restrictive. And in that context it, I think, has the ability over time to continue to bring the inflation rate down," said Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank President Thomas Hoenig after a speech here to business leaders. The Fed next meets on January 30-31 and investors think it will hold rates at 5.25 percent for the fifth straight meeting since it halted a long rate hike campaign last summer. Hoenig's remark dovetailed with the comfort expressed with the central bank's current policy stance by St. Louis Fed Bank President William Poole and San Francisco Fed chief Janet Yellen, who spoke at separate events on Wednesday. Judging from interest rate futures, investors now see little prospect of a cut in Fed rates before the middle of 2007 and the odds of a move down before year end also have slimmed. This contrasts sharply with the high expectations of a cut visible in futures' pricing last month. But investors have been swayed by relatively robust economic data, and the steady drumbeat of hawkish remarks from the central bank. Hoenig, a voting member of the Fed's policy committee this year, continued this pattern. He forecast growth to pick up in 2007 while inflation receded. But he made plain he was not happy with current core inflation, a measure policy-makers prefer that strips out volatile food and energy prices. "Right now, at 2.6 percent year-over-year, I think that is higher than where it needs to be. My own view is the core CPI needs to be much closer to 2 percent," he said. The Consumer Price Index rose 0.5 percent in December and 2.6 percent in 2006, while core CPI rose 0.2 percent in the month and 2.6 percent for the year. "For me at least you want to see assurances that that is coming down, that that is what we're going to see, and that is unsustainable going forward," he said. This sentiment was echoed by Richmond Fed Bank President Jeffrey Lacker, the most publicly hawkish member of the Fed's interest rate committee, who voted at four consecutive meetings for higher interest rates. "The risk that core inflation surges again, or does not subside as desired, clearly remains the predominant macroeconomic policy risk," Lacker, who is not a voter this year, told the Richmond chapter of the Risk Management Association on Friday. "The November inflation reports ... have provided some tentative evidence suggesting a moderating trend," he said, but it would take several months of data for it to be convincing evidence. U.S. growth slowed in the third quarter to 2 percent on an annual basis from a 2.6 percent pace in the previous three months, due to a steep decline in the contribution from residential construction as the housing sector cooled. However, recent data on home building has been upbeat. The Commerce Department reported on Thursday a 4.5 percent jump in December housing starts, a second straight monthly increase. "We are beginning to see the housing market settle out," said Hoenig, who called the November and December numbers as a "good sign" and predicted the overhang of unsold houses should take about six months to get worked off. Some fear the housing sector could suffer a steeper setback, with damaging consequences for consumer spending and growth. Hoenig said this remained a risk, but was not the most likely outcome.
