 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Standard & Poor's 500 Index and the Nasdaq ended higher, while the Dow industrials finished lower. A rebound in oil prices and news of a share buyback by Alcoa Inc. outweighed a string of disappointing earnings reports. 

 Based on the latest available data, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 2.40 points, or 0.02 percent, to end unofficially at 12,565.53. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was up 4.13 points, or 0.29 percent, to finish unofficially at 1,430.50. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 8.10 points, or 0.33 percent, to close unofficially at 2,451.31. For the week, the Dow edged up 0.075 percent, but the S&P 500 dipped 0.02 percent and the Nasdaq fell 2.06 percent.
