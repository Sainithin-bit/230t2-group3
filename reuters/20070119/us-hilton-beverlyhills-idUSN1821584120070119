 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Hilton Hotels Corp. HLT.N and Beverly Hilton-owner Oasis West Realty LLC announced on Thursday plans to redevelop the hotel and build a 120-room Waldorf-Astoria hotel as well as condominiums on the nine-acre Beverly Hills, California property. 

 The companies said the $500 million project, which is still subject to approval by the city, will include "new world-class architecture," 4.5 acres of gardens, open space and an outdoor public art collection. Beny Alagem, chairman of Oasis West and owner of The Beverly Hilton, said the urban property, which hosts Hollywood events such as the Golden Globe Awards, would be turned into a garden environment. "This is a big investment. We hope we will have a good return," he told Reuters. Hilton, which is headquartered in Beverly Hills, said the Waldorf-Astoria Beverly Hills will be the first new-build hotel for the luxury brand on the West Coast. "The location here is just so great. It's a perfect fit for us," said Matthew Hart, the company's president and chief operating officer. Hart, who was named to Hilton's board on Thursday, is thought to be a potential successor to Hilton Chief Executive Stephen Bollenbach, who is stepping down from the post at the end of this year. The Beverly Hilton, which recently completed an $80 million renovation, will eventually become a 402-room hotel with new rooms, an upgraded conference center and a new entry. Each hotel will be operated and managed by Hilton. The long-term plan includes traffic improvements, the creation of 500 percent more open space and gardens and three new buildings containing 120 new luxury residences that will share hotel amenities such as room service and catering. At today's real estate prices, the 3,500-square foot condos would sell for $3.9 million to $4.4 million, Alagem said. "This will be the ultimate luxury ... the whole issue of hotel services is something that the public is asking for," he said. Alagem said plans for the project and an environmental impact study will go to the Beverly Hills City Council this summer, with construction likely to take two to three years after the plans are approved.
