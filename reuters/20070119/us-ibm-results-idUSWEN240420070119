 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - IBM's ( IBM.N ) quarterly profit rose 11 percent, but its shares fell more than 5 percent as the earnings failed to beat some investors' forecasts and computer hardware sales lagged some targets. 

 The stock had been up 37 percent from a year low last July, raising expectations for the world's largest technology services company. International Business Machines Corp.'s quarterly revenue was boosted by a string of software-firm acquisitions, while it also reported on Thursday $17.8 billion in services contracts, an indicator of future business and the best in four years. Fourth-quarter net income advanced to $3.54 billion, or $2.31 per share, from $3.19 billion, or $1.99 per share, a year earlier. Revenue climbed to $26.3 billion from $24.4 billion. Earnings before special items were $2.26 per share, topping a $2.19 average Wall Street forecast based on Reuters Estimates. But IBM shares fell 5.2 percent to $94.24 in after-hours trade from a New York Stock Exchange close of $99.45. A Nasdaq index of computer hardware stocks fell 2.4 percent on Thursday on disappointing forecasts this week from top computer chip maker Intel Corp. ( INTC.O ) and iPod maker Apple Inc. ( AAPL.O ). "Everybody's expectations were high going into it, technology is having an awful day, and IBM was the last to sell off," said Marc Heilweil, manager of Spectrum Advisory Services' Marathon Value Portfolio, whose top holding is IBM. The stock price drop "has to do a lot with psychology, plus the fact that it had had a run-up," he said. "If people are saying that technology spending is not going to be real strong, you sell anticipating that things are going to be a little weaker." GREAT QUARTER, PRICED IN Heilweil also said revenue growth in IBM's hardware business fell short of some analysts' estimates. Hardware revenue rose 4.3 percent to $7.2 billion, while its gross profit margin slipped to 41 percent from 42 percent. "It looks like a great quarter, but that was priced in," said Jerome Heppelmann, chief investment officer of Liberty Ridge Capital, which does not own IBM. Although earnings topped published Wall Street targets, he said they only met the less official expectations of some analysts and investors, known as "whisper numbers". The stock, up about 21 percent in the last 12 months prior to the results, had been trading at 15 times expected 2007 earnings per share, compared to 17 for Hewlett-Packard Co. ( HPQ.N ), which competes with IBM in computer hardware, and 20 for services rival Accenture Ltd. ( ACN.N ). IBM has been expanding in software, its most profitable business, and last year bought 11 software providers including Internet Security Systems Inc. and FileNet Corp. Technology services signings recovered after slumping earlier in 2006, as Armonk, New York-based IBM won deals from the German military and Britain's Vodafone Group Plc ( VOD.L ). Revenue from technology services, IBM's largest unit, rose to $12.8 billion from $12 billion. The business's $17.8 billion worth of contract signings were up 55 percent from a year ago. Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge told a conference call with analysts that IBM is optimistic heading into 2007, and is on track to grow 2007 earnings per share by a low-double digit percentage rate, reaffirming IBM's long-term outlook. "We would expect earnings per share for 2007 to again be in line with our longer-term model," Loughridge said on the call. IBM's long-term financial model is for earnings per share to increase 10 percent to 12 percent per year, Loughridge said, based on annual revenue growth of 5 percent to 6 percent. Wall Street analysts are looking for IBM to report revenue, on average, of $94.48 billion for the full 2007 year, up from the $91.42 billion in 2006. Chief Executive Samuel Palmisano last year announced 14 purchases worth some $4.9 billion in all. They partly reflected an IBM push to automate services offerings, a traditionally lower-margin business, with more-profitable software. Revenue from IBM's software business, which typically accounts for about a fifth of total sales, rose 15 percent to $5.65 billion from $4.9 billion. The segment's gross profit margin was 86.5 percent compared with 86.3 percent a year ago. (Additional reporting by  Eric Auchard  and  Michael Kahn  in San Francisco and  Chris Sanders  in New York)
