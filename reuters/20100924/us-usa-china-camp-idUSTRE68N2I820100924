 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A senior Republican said he plans to support a bill that pressures China to raise the value of its currency when the bill is put to a vote in the House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee on Friday morning. 

 "While I will vote in support, ... I am also deeply concerned that this is the only mark-up of a trade bill we've had in the 111th Congress," Representative Dave Camp said in a statement. Camp said changes made this week to the bill made him more optimistic it would not automatically violate World Trade Organization rules. (Reporting by  Doug Palmer ; Editing by Leslie Adler)
