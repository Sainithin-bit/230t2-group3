 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A federal judge signaled she will approve Citigroup Inc's $75 million settlement with regulators over the bank's failure to disclose losses on subprime mortgages, provided that she gets assurances that Citigroup maintains strict reforms. 

 Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle had refused at an August 16 hearing to approve the accord between Citi and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. But at a Friday hearing, she indicated she will do so once changes are made to ensure the bank will maintain proper disclosure practices in the future. "It sounds like you will be able to reach an agreement that I will find satisfactory," Huvelle told lawyers for Citigroup and the SEC. Once the changes are made, "I will ultimately approve the settlement," she added. "I am trying make sure that procedures are in place to address the problem that occurred." Huvelle expressed concern that Citigroup's management could weaken its disclosure practices without repercussions. The judge also said she was "satisfied" with the $75 million penalty, which she said was "certainly not designed to impose great hardship on current shareholders." She agreed to give the parties two weeks to present a revised settlement. During the last year, judges have increased their scrutiny of proposed settlements, also attacking accords struck with Bank of America Corp and Barclays Plc. "The judge wants far-reaching agreements to address the bigger picture: preventing future disclosure failures and allowing for better oversight," said Elizabeth Nowicki, a Tulane University Law School professor and former SEC lawyer. "Ever since the Great Depression, Congress and the Supreme Court have recognized that sunlight is the best disinfectant for the market," Nowicki added. "This judge gets that." SEC spokesman John Nester declined to provide immediate comment. Citigroup spokeswoman Shannon Bell said: "We are pleased with today's hearing and will comply with the judge's request." LOSSES SOARED, SHARES PLUMMETED The SEC had accused Citigroup of misleading investors by telling them from July to October 2007 that its exposure to subprime securities was only about $13 billion -- only to reveal that November that the sum was more than $52 billion. Soaring losses from risky debt led to a series of bailouts that left the government owning one-third of Citigroup, a stake it has been reducing, and drove Citigroup shares down below $1 in March 2009 from above $50 less than two years earlier. The settlement "seems fair and reasonable," said Matt McCormick, a portfolio manager at Bahl & Gaynor Investment Counsel in Cincinnati. "Many people didn't doubt there would be some type of settlement. The question was when, and how much." In refusing last month to approve the accord, Huvelle was reported to have complained that Citigroup and the SEC wanted her to act as a "rubber stamp." Her resistance recalled U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff's rejection last September of a $33 million SEC settlement with Bank of America over charges the largest U.S. bank hid $15.8 billion of losses and $3.6 billion of bonus payouts at Merrill Lynch & Co, which it was buying. Rakoff later approved a $150 million accord, but called even that "half-baked justice at best." Also in August, U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan labeled as a "sweetheart deal" a $298 million Justice Department accord with Barclays to resolve criminal charges that the British bank violated trade sanctions by dealing with banks in Cuba, Iran, Libya, Myanmar and Sudan. He later approved the accord. Huvelle on Friday did chide the SEC for dropping a "bombshell" in identifying in court papers then-Citigroup Chief Executive Charles Prince and then-senior adviser Robert Rubin as having known that some higher-rated subprime mortgages were causing losses, but then failing to charge them. The only bank individuals accused of wrongdoing were former Chief Financial Officer Gary Crittenden and former investor relations chief Arthur Tildesley. They agreed to civil penalties, and like the bank did not admit wrongdoing. "People's reputations are at stake," Huvelle said. "This is when the SEC is doing a disservice to the public." Citigroup shares closed up 11 cents at $3.91 on the New York Stock Exchange. The case is SEC v. Citigroup Inc, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia, No. 10-01277.
