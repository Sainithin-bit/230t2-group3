 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japanese Economy Minister Banri Kaieda said on Friday the government should not rule out new government bond issuance to fund an extra budget for the current fiscal year to March. 

 "The government needs to consider various sources of revenue (to fund an extra budget). When that's not enough, we need to do what we need to do, including issuing government bonds," Kaieda told public broadcaster NHK in an interview. The government plans to compile an extra budget to support the fragile economic recovery. But both Prime Minister Naoto Kan and Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda have said the government will aim not to increase bond issuance in response to Japan's fiscal predicament.
