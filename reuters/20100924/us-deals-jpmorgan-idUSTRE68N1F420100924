 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase and Co ( JPM.N ) is making the traditional top two in the worldwide rankings of deal advisors -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ) and Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) -- fight hard to keep their dominance. 

 In fact, the bank led by hard-charging CEO Jamie Dimon, has climbed two places to the No. 2 slot in the top league table rankings, Thomson Reuters data through September 21 shows. For the third quarter on its own, JPMorgan actually led the pack with $179.2 billion of deals. JPMorgan's strength through the financial crisis over the last couple of years has burnished the second-largest U.S. bank's image and helped it draw more clients, Jimmy Elliott, global head of M&A, told Reuters in an interview. Elliott, a veteran of deals such as Exxon's $86 billion takeover of Mobil in 1999, is pleased with the results, but still wants to bolster the bank's technology and natural resources M&A teams. Elliott, a Texas resident, has been involved personally in some of JPMorgan's largest M&A assignments this year, including two hostile bids -- BHP Billiton Ltd's ( BHP.AX )( BLT.L ) $39 billion offer for Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc ( POT.TO ) and Air Products and Chemicals Inc's ( APD.N ) $5.5 billion bid for Airgas Inc ( ARG.N ). "We weathered the storm. This has certainly had a positive effect on people's perspective on JPMorgan as a brand," Elliott said. "There is no doubt that has created synergies that have benefited our M&A business." JPMorgan, along with its unit JPMorgan Cazenove in Europe, is advising on five of the 10 largest deals announced this year, including the BHP Billiton offer and Sanofi-Aventis SA's ( SASY.PA ) bid for Genzyme Corp GENZ.O, the data shows. "These are high-profile clients," Elliott said. "When they have mission-critical transactions that they need to get done ... they are turning to us more." Elliott credits his team for landing these assignments. "Having the best people to bring to the table is what makes us successful," he said. It also does not hurt that the bank has the firepower to finance almost any deal. "The fact that we have a balance sheet to help our clients is an additional competitive advantage," Elliott said. JPMorgan, which bought investment bank Bear Stearns in 2008, also push its way to the top of the European league table through September 21, up from No. 9 last year, the data shows. It also rose a spot to third among advisers on deals involving U.S. companies. Still, its lead is tenuous. In the worldwide M&A league table, Morgan Stanley is a mere $4 billion behind JPMorgan's deal volume of $344.1 billion so far this year. "We've had a tremendous run," Elliott said. "We don't judge our business on a quarter-to-quarter basis, though we certainly are happy about the quarter we had." (Reporting by Paritosh Bansal; editing by  Andre Grenon )
