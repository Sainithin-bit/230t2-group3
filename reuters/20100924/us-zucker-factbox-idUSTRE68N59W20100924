 (Reuters) - NBC Universal Chief Executive Jeff Zucker told his staff on Friday he would leave the company after Comcast Corp formally takes control, likely by the end of the year. 

 Here is a look at some major hits and misses during Zucker's controversial four-year reign. HITS * CABLE Zucker helped build a stable of cable networks like USA and Bravo, which are highly valued by Wall Street. NBCU bought the Oxygen channel in 2007 and The Weather Channel in 2008. Cable channels generate more than 80 percent of NBCU's operating profits. Comcast Corp bought a majority stake in the network in 2009. * OLYMPICS NBCU paid a pricey $2.2 billion for U.S. broadcast rights to the 2010 and 2012 Olympics. Hundreds of millions of people tuned in to watch Vancouver 2010 games on NBC, which the network used to promote its revamped prime-time lineup. Media watchers said the Olympics created a halo effect around NBC's new shows and improved its brand image. MISSES * SILVERMAN In 2008, Zucker hired Ben Silverman, a young producer who was supposed to kick-start NBC's prime-time lineup. During his stint at NBC, Silverman struggled to develop prime-time hits and the network remained in last place in the ratings, behind CBS Corp, News Corp's Fox and Walt Disney Co's ABC. Silverman left NBC in 2009. * TONIGHT SHOW In January 2010, NBC endured a public relations nightmare after paying "Tonight Show" host Conan O'Brien $45 million to leave so Jay Leno could return as host. Leno's variety show in the 10 p.m. slot turned off viewers and alienated local broadcast affiliates. It was canceled. (Reporting by  Liana B. Baker )
