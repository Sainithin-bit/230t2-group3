 LONDON  (Reuters) - Thomson Reuters Corp ( TRI.N ) ( TRI.TO ) and EBS, which is owned by ICAP ICAP.L, will launch offshore yuan trading on their rival foreign exchange matching platforms next week after a recent relaxation of Chinese currency rules. 

 China in July eased restrictions on how freely the yuan could be traded by allowing firms to buy or sell yuan in Hong Kong without limits as part of a broader drive to increase the international use of its currency. "The existing Matching community, which are also registered HKMA (Hong Kong Monetary Authority) authorized institutions, will be able to access and trade dollar/yuan, euro/yuan and yuan/yen pairs," Thomson Reuters said in a statement. It said the yuan would be available on its matching service from Monday, September 27. ICAP, the world's biggest interdealer broker, said it would also launch new currency pairs for Hong Kong delivered Chinese yuan on its EBS platform on Monday. The Thomson Reuters matching platform allows the interbank market to match trades anonymously over an electronic system. A company official said about 1,200 banks subscribe to the system, which offers more than 50 spot currency pairs. Jeff Ward, head of electronic broking in Asia for ICAP, said the launch of dollar/yuan trading on EBS would support the development of the yuan as a currency for international trade and settlement in Hong Kong. "All (yuan) trades will settle in Hong Kong and banks looking to trade this pair must have a pre-arranged clearing and settlement arrangement with a Hong Kong authorized institution," he said in a statement. China's decision to lift controls on the use of the yuan in Hong Kong has already prompted some deliverable forward deals in the territory. It is expected to bring a windfall of capital inflows to the city and is viewed by analysts as underscoring Beijing's resolve to develop Hong Kong as an offshore yuan trading center.
