 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives will vote next week on a bill that aims to put more pressure on China over the yuan by allowing duties on goods from countries that undervalue currencies, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said on Friday. 

 "We recognize the efforts China is making toward reform, but they need to act faster to allow their currency to appreciate," Hoyer said in a statement. (Reporting by  Donna Smith ; Editing by  Chizu Nomiyama )
