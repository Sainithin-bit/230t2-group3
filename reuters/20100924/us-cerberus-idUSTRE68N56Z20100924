 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management LP is planning to revive its Chrysler Financial lending unit, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, citing sources with knowledge of the situation. 

 It will lend to mid-size firms unable to tap banks and public debt markets, the Wall Street Journal reported. Chrysler, previously a Cerberus investment, emerged from a U.S. government-funded bankruptcy in June 2009. Cerberus retained ownership of Chrysler Financial. Cerberus was not immediately available for comment. (Editing by Carol Bishopric)
