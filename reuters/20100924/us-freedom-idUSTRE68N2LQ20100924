 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Former Chrysler Chief Executive Bob Nardelli is joining firearms and ammunition maker Freedom Group, the company said in a press release. 

 Nardelli left Chrysler 2009 after the car maker emerged from bankruptcy and joined private equity firm Cerberus -- the former majority owner of Chrysler -- as an adviser. Freedom said it formed a CEO's office to provide strategic direction to the company's operating management and to facilitate decision making pending the appointment of a new CEO. Freedom's former CEO, Theodore Torbeck, resigned earlier this month. (Reporting by  Megan Davies , editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
