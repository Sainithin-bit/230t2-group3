 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President Barack Obama plans on Wednesday to unveil his proposal to streamline the U.S. financial regulatory system and hopes Congress will approve it quickly to prevent future crises, he said on Tuesday. 

 "I think when you see the overall approach that we are taking, you will see that we have not, in fact, added a host of regulatory agencies. In fact there is going to be streamlining, consolidation ... so that you don't find people falling through the gaps," Obama told reporters in the Rose Garden. (Reporting by  Corbett B.
