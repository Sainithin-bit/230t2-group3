 YEKATERINBURG  (Reuters) - The leaders of Brazil, Russia, India and China have asked their finance ministries and central banks to work on proposals regarding new reserve currencies, a Russian delegation source told Reuters on Tuesday. 

 The request did not feature in the joint communique issued after the first BRIC summit. The source said finance ministries and central banks have also been asked to outline proposals on a wider use of BRIC domestic currencies in domestic trade.
