 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A federal judge gave bankrupt Delphi Corp final approval on Tuesday to tap former parent General Motors Inc for access to $250 million in funding that is expected to support the Troy, Michigan-based auto parts supplier until it can emerge from bankruptcy. 

 U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain also approved a motion that would classify reclamation claims as unsecured. Drain also allowed Delphi to end its use of the services of consulting firm Deloitte & Touche LLP. Delphi, which was spun off from General Motors Corp in 1999 and filed for bankruptcy in 2005, said earlier in June it had reached a deal to sell most of its global operations to private equity firm Platinum Equity, potentially allowing the car parts supplier to emerge from its nearly four-year bankruptcy. Delphi remains one of GM's key suppliers and GM has taken more than $11 billion of charges to help the company's reorganization along. GM, which also has filed for bankruptcy, received court approval at a hearing earlier in June, to continue providing support to its suppliers. The case is In re: Delphi Corp et al, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York, No. 05-44481. (Reporting by Phil Wahba)
