 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Obama administration has declined a request by struggling automotive suppliers for additional assistance, prompting efforts in Congress to help the battered sector. 

 A government source said the administration's autos task force rejected a request by supplier industry trade groups for billions in loan guarantees. Auto suppliers have been rocked by depressed automotive sales and production shutdowns at bankrupt General Motors Corp GMGMQ.PK and Chrysler Group LLC, which emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings and entered an alliance with Italy's Fiat ( FIA.MI ) last week.
