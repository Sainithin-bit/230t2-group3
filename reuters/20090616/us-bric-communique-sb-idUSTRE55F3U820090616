 YEKATERINBURG  (Reuters) - The draft communique of Brazil, Russia, India and China urges international financial reform but does not mention the role of U.S. dollar or a supranational reserve currency, sources with knowledge of  the document told Reuters on Tuesday. 

 The sources said the draft communique calls for a "diversified, stable and predictable currency system" as well as for bigger role of emerging economies in international financial institutions. The communique is yet to be signed by BRIC leaders (Reporting by Moscow bureau)
