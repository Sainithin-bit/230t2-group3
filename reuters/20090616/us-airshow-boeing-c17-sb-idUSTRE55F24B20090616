 PARIS  (Reuters) - Boeing Co ( BA.N ) said additional orders for eight C-17 cargo aircraft would extend the production line "well into 2011" if approved by the U.S. Congress. 

 Jean Chamberlin, head of the C-17 program for Boeing, told Reuters in an interview at the Paris Air Show on Tuesday that the company was aggressively pursuing additional cost reductions on the aircraft as it marketed the plane overseas. Chamberlin welcomed moves by U.S. lawmakers to add eight more planes in fiscal year 2009 and said the company would continue to lobby Congress for 15 planes to be added in fiscal 2010.
