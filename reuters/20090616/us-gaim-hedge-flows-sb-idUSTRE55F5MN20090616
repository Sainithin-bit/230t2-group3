 By Laurence Fletcher MONACO  (Reuters) - The outlook for investor flows into the battered hedge fund industry remains tough for now, although institutional clients could reenter the market before year-end, executives at a hedge fund conference said. 

 Speakers at GAIM 2009 on Tuesday said both institutions and high net worth individuals appeared reluctant to put money into an industry that saw its worst annual performance on record in 2008, even though returns have picked up this year. "I think high net worth individuals ... need to see a good year of attractive performance for them to return to investing in our industry," said Tim Sweeting of Ignis Asset Management, although he said he saw signs redemptions overall were slowing. Investors pulled out around $250 billion from hedge funds between October and March, according to Hedge Fund Research, as they fretted over disappointing performance or took money out of any readily available sources of cash. The outflows contributed to a reduction in the size of the industry to around $1.3 trillion in assets under management, from a peak of around $2 trillion last summer. Further redemptions are likely as funds that limited investor outflows finally allow investors to exit. "We conduct a survey of institutional investors ... and they (flows) are probably going to get worse before they get better. But there's long-term support for alternative assets -- institutional investors remain very supportive," said Coller Capital's Stephen Ziff. Ignis' Sweeting also said there were signs institutional investors could come back. "We're seeing some signs of life... I think institutions will provide the greatest inflows going forward, assuming relative normality by the end of the year we should see some institutional flows coming in." Meanwhile, with investor assets harder to come by, managers who can boast the top performance track records look likely to end up with the lion's share of assets. "I expect attrition (of firms) rather than consolidation. I see assets consolidating to the better-performing managers," Peter Clarke, chief executive of Man Group ( EMG.L ), told Reuters on the sidelines of the conference. (Editing by Simon Jessop)
