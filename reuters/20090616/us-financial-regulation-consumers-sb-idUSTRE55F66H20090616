 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Obama administration intends to propose the creation of an independent Consumer Financial Protection Agency that will be able to write and enforce rules for a wide group of financial firms. 

 The administration plans to propose that the new agency enforce fair lending laws, and have the authority to require loan originators to retain 5 percent of credit risk. According to a document obtained by Reuters and later confirmed by an administration official on Tuesday, the agency will "protect consumers of credit, savings, payment and other consumer financial products and services, and to regulate all providers of such products and services." The Obama administration intends to lay out on Wednesday its plan to overhaul financial regulation, which will include plans for a regulator to monitor risk across the financial system, proposals on capital standards, and transparency in derivatives markets. The idea of a consumer financial protection agency has attracted opposition from some business groups who fear that it will stifle product innovation and undermine financial firms' primary regulators. Consumer advocates and lawmakers from both political parties have strongly endorsed the creation of a new agency to protect consumers after a credit crisis largely fueled by loosely regulated mortgage products and servicers. As laid out by the administration document, the new agency will define standards for "plain vanilla" products such as mortgages with straightforward terms. The agency could restrict or ban prepayment penalties and could also ensure that banks, nonbanks, and independent mortgage brokers all play by the same rules. It would also be responsible for enforcing the Community Reinvestment Act, which encourages banks to make loans in disadvantaged communities.
