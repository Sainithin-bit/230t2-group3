 (Reuters) - Hedge fund managers, administrators and investors have gathered in Monaco for the annual GAIM industry conference following a tough year marked by poor performance and client outflows. 

 Below are selected quotes from the first day of the conference: JONATHAN FEENEY, INVESTCORP INVESTMENT ADVISORS: "In the last five years or so ... everything was flying and no one cared about risk management. It's only when problems arise that it suddenly becomes a focus, and then it's too late. "With a new manager, it's horrible to say this, but it's got to the stage now where you want to check the office exists. It's the paranoia now post-Madoff." YARIV ITAH, PARTNER AT CONSULTANTS CASEY QUIRK AND ASSOCIATES: "Pension plans increasingly want to see a list of other investors ... Some private investors and even institutions are seen as hot money, (pension funds) don't want to invest with them." LEE ROBINSON, TRAFALGAR ASSET MANAGEMENT: "Bears are worried that fiat currency may be a giant Ponzi scheme. PETER CLARKE, CEO, MAN GROUP: "Gating a private investor is a very difficult decision ... We didn't gate any private investors. Investors need to be forewarned and the conditions laid out clearly where gates could be imposed. "If you lock up and say (there are) fees during the lock through, I don't think people are going to accept that." STEPHEN ZIFF, COLLER CAPITAL "The pendulum has swung back to investors (from hedge fund managers) ... Who holds the whip hand? You've got to say investors." KEVIN PACKENHAM, JEFFERIES INTERNATIONAL "It (the hedge fund industry) has many of the characteristics of an adolescent industry. It has problems, but I suggest they are reputational and technical ones and therefore can be solved." (Compiled by Laurence Fletcher and Martin de Sa'Pinto; Editing by Maureen Bavdek)
