 PARIS  (Reuters) - Regional air transport could be "back on pace" by the end of this year and "certainly next year," Honeywell's ( HON.N ) Advanced Technology vice president, Bob Smith, told Reuters Television on Tuesday. 

 Business aviation will take longer to recover and faces a "rough year" in 2010, though it should pick up in 2011 or 2012, Smith said at the Paris Air Show.
