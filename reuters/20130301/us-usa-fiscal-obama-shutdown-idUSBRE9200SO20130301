 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President Barack Obama pressed the Congress on Friday to avoid a government shutdown when federal spending authority runs out on March 27, saying it is the "right thing to do."

"I think that's preventable," he told reporters of the threat of the threat of a government shutdown. (Reporting By  Matt Spetalnick  and Roberta Rampton)
