 GENEVA  (Reuters) - International passenger traffic rose 4.9 percent in September on a year ago, led by robust growth for carriers in China, Latin America and the Middle East, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) said on Friday. 
 A two-speed recovery is emerging in the industry, as European airlines experience "profitless growth" and North American airlines operate in a "slow to no-growth environment", it said. International air freight traffic was up by 0.5 percent versus the same month in 2011, the Geneva-based body said. (Reporting by  Stephanie Nebehay )
