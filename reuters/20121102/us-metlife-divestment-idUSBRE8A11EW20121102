 (Reuters) - MetLife Inc ( MET.N ), the largest U.S. life insurer, said it will sell MetLife Bank's mortgage servicing portfolio to a unit of JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ) for an undisclosed amount, as it looks to exit its bank holding structure. 
 The $70 billion servicing portfolio will increase JPMorganChase Bank's $1.1 trillion servicing business by more than 5 percent, MetLife said in a statement. MetLife said in a regulatory filing last Wednesday that it had begun exploring the sale of MetLife Bank's forward mortgage servicing assets and operation, and was reporting the business as divested.  link.reuters.com/pyp73t The Federal Reserve last month extended the deadline for MetLife to resubmit its capital plans while the company works to complete the sale of its bank deposit-taking operations to GE Capital. MetLife has a bank holding company charter because of its banking unit and is therefore overseen by the Fed. In March, the company failed a stress test and was blocked by the U.S. central bank from raising its dividend or buying back shares. MetLife shares closed at $34.70 on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by Aman Shah in Bangalore; Editing by Anil D'Silva)
