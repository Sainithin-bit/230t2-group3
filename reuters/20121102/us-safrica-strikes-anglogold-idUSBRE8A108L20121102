 JOHANNESBURG  (Reuters) - AngloGold Ashanti ( ANGJ.J ), the world's third largest gold producer, has suspended operations at its TauTona mine in South Africa due to a worker sit-in protest over a bonus payment, the company said on Friday. 
 "There are about 300 people doing a sit-in underground. Management is talking to them," company spokesman Alan Fine said. Another sit-in at AngloGold's Mponeng mine ended on Thursday, but operations there are only expected to resume on Sunday night as some repairs need to be done, Fine added.
