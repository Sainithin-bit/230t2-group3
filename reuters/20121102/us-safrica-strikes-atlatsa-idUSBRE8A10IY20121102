 JOHANNESBURG  (Reuters) - Atlatsa Resources ( ATL.V ) has extended a deadline for the return of striking workers at its Bokoni platinum mine in South Africa to November 6 after community leaders intervened in the dispute, the company's chief commercial officer said on Friday. 
 An offer to pay striking miners a once-off payment of 2,000 rand ($230) to facilitate their return remained valid, Joel Kesler told Reuters. ($1 = 8.6513 South African rand) (Reporting by  Agnieszka Flak ; Editing by  Ed Cropley )
