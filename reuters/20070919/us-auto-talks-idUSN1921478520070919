 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) would give new union members 401(k)-style retirement plans instead of traditional pensions for the first time under a proposed United Auto Workers contract, Bloomberg News said on its Web site, citing people with knowledge of the talks. 

 GM also has proposed freezing cost-of-living raises to help pay for a union-run fund that would take responsibility for retiree health care, the report said. After breaking off talks at around 9 p.m on Tuesday, GM and UAW negotiators were prepared to return to the bargaining table on Wednesday morning, a person familiar with the talks said. Spokespeople for GM and UAW were not immediately available for comment.
