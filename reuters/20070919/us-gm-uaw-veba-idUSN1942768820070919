 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp.( GM.N ) is proposing a cost-saving trust fund for health care expenses for all United Auto Workers union members, including active employees, a person close to the talks said. 

 Discussions so far on a plan to allow GM to create a new UAW-aligned trust fund -- known as a voluntary employee beneficiary association, or VEBA -- were thought to have included only retired GM workers and not the 73,000 active UAW employees.
