 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Fruit of the Loom Inc, a maker of underwear and other apparel, on Wednesday said it will close its Jerzees de Choloma plant in Choloma, Honduras, within the next few months, resulting in a loss of 800 jobs. 

 The unit of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc ( BRKa.N ) ( BRKb.N ) said the closure results from a shift in product demand and the consolidation of facilities following its purchase last year of Russell Corp, a maker of athletic apparel. Fruit of the Loom said it will work with affected employees to identify possible jobs at other company facilities. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel)
