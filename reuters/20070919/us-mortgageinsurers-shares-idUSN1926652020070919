 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Mortgage insurers' shares rose on Wednesday as investors saw them benefiting from regulatory moves that will boost their business. 

 Earlier on Wednesday the regulator for Fannie Mae FNM.N and Freddie Mac FRE.N, the biggest sources of U.S. housing finance, said they could buy $20 billion more in subprime mortgages to help revive the credit-squeezed market. Both Fannie and Freddie require home buyers who borrow more than 80 percent of their home's value to provide some form of protection, generally mortgage insurance. That, coupled with the Federal Reserve's half-point rate cut on Tuesday, are seen supporting the mortgage insurers, whose shares had plunged more than 50 percent since the credit crisis started earlier this year. "We have drawn a line under the credit crisis," said Howard Shapiro, a mortgage insurance analyst with Fox Pitt Kelton. Mortgage insurers guarantee the lender will be repaid even if the borrower defaults. Also helping mortgage insurers' shares was a statement by Lehman Brothers Holdings LEH.N Chief Financial Officer Chris O'Meara on Tuesday that "the worst of this credit correction is behind us." In Wednesday afternoon trading, MGIC Investment ( MTG.N ) was 5.1 percent higher at $35.21, while Radian Group ( RDN.N ) climbed 12.6 percent to $25.87. PMI Group PMI.N advanced 5.2 percent to $34.25. All three trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Triad Guaranty TGIC.O, the fourth major mortgage insurer, rose 12.5 percent to $19.88. GROUP STILL DOWN "Mortgage insurers as a group had lost more than half their stock market value during the subprime credit crisis," said Tom Abruzzo, head of Fitch's mortgage insurance group. "While the market perceives this as good news, this area is still down significantly." MGIC shares hit a 12-month high of $70.10 in February, while its low was $27.36 earlier this month. Shapiro, who recommends purchasing the stock, said he expects a rebound to $50 a share. The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, which regulates Fannie and Freddie, agreed on Wednesday to relax restrictions on the mortgage finance companies' investment holdings to allow them to buy more subprime loans. Mortgage lenders, including Genworth Financial ( GNW.N ), have said they expect to benefit from Fannie and Freddie's expansion. Genworth Chief Executive Michael Fraizer said in an interview earlier this month that Fannie and Freddie's share of all mortgage loans underwritten rose to 70 percent in August from below 35 percent in June 2006.
