 LONDON  (Reuters) - Shares in embattled British bank Northern Rock NRK.L tumbled 20 percent to an all-time low on Wednesday as speculation mounted that potential buyers are not interested or will only pitch a cut-price bid. 

 Britain's fifth biggest mortgage lender, seen as a probable takeover target since being engulfed by a funding and customer confidence crisis on Friday, may struggle to attract a suitor given damage to its brand, tough capital markets and the stated aims of potential buyers to diversify away from UK mortgages, industry sources said. The shares ended down 16 percent at 257 pence, after falling to 246.25 pence, the lowest level since the bank floated almost exactly 10 years ago. The drop valued the bank at just over 1 billion pounds ($2 billion), down 78 percent this year. "I can't see why anyone would pay a big price when they know the trouble Northern Rock is in," said Colin Morton at Rensburg Fund Management, who sold his stake in the bank on Friday. "There is still risk -- this is a company that needs a lot of funding in the wholesale market," he said, adding that the UK housing market also looks like slowing. The crisis at the bank was sparked on Friday when the Bank of England stepped in with an emergency funding facility, after it was unable to raise funds in wholesale markets. LITTLE APPETITE FOR BID The latest leg down by its shares was blamed on talk of opportunistic cut-price bids for the bank from UK rivals Lloyds TSB ( LLOY.L ), HBOS HBOS.L or HSBC ( HSBA.L ). A bid could be pitched at 200p a share or lower, according to dealers. Industry sources said all three are likely to have little appetite for a deal, however. "There were a lot of people expecting an announcement within days saying Northern Rock had three or four people looking at it or the Bank of England had come up with some agreement that the bank would carve itself up and sell itself out in a series of portfolios. But there's been no news, and no sign of news," one industry source said. Lloyds held talks to mount a rescue of its rival, but a deal was blocked by the BoE and Financial Services Authority, industry sources have said. Lloyds is midway through its own recovery plan and is unlikely to be willing to take on the risks of financing Northern Rock's funding book, sources said. HBOS, the biggest UK mortgage provider with a 20 percent share, has in recent years made clear its intention to diversify into other areas. HSBC is one of the world's best capitalized banks and could easily afford a deal, but has repeatedly said its focus is on expanding in Asia and other emerging markets and is under fire from a U.S. activist investor to accelerate that strategy. Lloyds, HBOS, HSBC and Northern Rock all declined to comment. Two of Northern Rock's major shareholders also cut their stakes, indicating a lack of confidence a takeover is near. Its biggest investor, Baillie Gifford, said it had cut its 6 percent stake, but refused to comment on reports it had sold it all. OPTIONS LIMITED Northern Rock's options include a sale of all or parts of the business, running the mortgage book down or trying to stay independent. It said on Monday it was not in takeover talks but would explore strategic options. Northern Rock has lent aggressively to home buyers in recent years to grow its market share. A global credit crunch means any bank will also be wary of having to refinance Northern Rock's balance sheet in money markets until liquidity and stability return, analysts said. The BoE on Wednesday offered to pump cash into money markets next week to bring interbank lending rates down. Time is not on the side of Northern Rock's board to find a buyer or sell assets, however, as authorities are keen to prevent worries spreading wider across the UK banking sector. Northern Rock's shares had climbed early on Wednesday as optimism grew that a run on the bank by savings customers had faded. Up to 2.5 billion pounds is estimated to have been withdrawn by retail customers, according to industry sources, but the pace of withdrawals slowed sharply on Tuesday after the government guaranteed savings were safe. Oriel Securities said Northern Rock's shares are already near its minimum estimated standalone run-off value. "We value cashflow from operations at 91 pence per share and the present value of capital releases at a further 142 pence per share, making a total of 233p," Oriel said in a note.
