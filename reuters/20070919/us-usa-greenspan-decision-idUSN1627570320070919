 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Decisions such as the U.S. Federal Reserve's rate cut on Tuesday are "very difficult" and may not necessarily be based on the most probable economic outcome, former Fed chairman Alan Greenspan said on Tuesday. 

 Speaking shortly after the Fed lowered interest rates for the first time in four years, Greenspan said monetary policy was based on "not the most probable outcome but the consequences of different outcomes." He was asked by his wife, journalist Andrea Mitchell, what current Fed chairman Ben Bernanke would have gone through on the day of a Fed rate decision. "There are decisions such as today that are very difficult," he said. "Once you take action, it's carved in stone and you can't take it out." He drew an example of when the Fed lowered rates in 2003, despite signs of economic recovery. "The reason we did that was ... because of the Japanese experience ... of the fear of corrosive deflation," he said. "Forecasting the future is tricky," he added. The former Fed chief stuck to his guns when asked about criticism that the Fed had erred in keeping short-term interest rates low for a prolonged time. "Guilty or not guilty?" Mitchell questioned. "Not guilty," Greenspan responded firmly. He spoke at an event in New York to promote his book "The Age of Turbulence: Adventures in a New World," which hit bookstores on Monday.
