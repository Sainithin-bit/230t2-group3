 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The worst of the credit crunch that forced Morgan Stanley to mark down loans and assets by $940 million during the third quarter is over, though loan markets will remain touchy, said Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) incoming chief financial officer Colm Kelleher. 

 "I do believe the worst is over," Kelleher, Morgan's global head of capital markets, told Reuters in an interview. "We're seeing some clear signs of recovery." Morgan Stanley earlier on Wednesday reported a 17 percent decline in third-quarter profit, falling short of expectations amid a decline in fixed income trading and the lower market value of corporate loans and other assets. The executive cautioned that credit markets were still more challenging than in the first half of this year, and that it will take several months before the lending environment approaches normal. "This will take some time to work through the credit markets. I would suspect you're talking about one to two quarters," said Kelleher, who succeeds Morgan Stanley CFO David Sidwell when he retires at the end of this year. A summertime freeze in the credit markets did significant damage to the world's second-largest investment bank, a company that over the past two years had scrambled to expand its leveraged loan and deal financing businesses. Dozens of buyouts contingent on big dollops of debt were in danger of breaking down as investors suddenly grew more cautious and demanded better terms. Sidwell, in the same interview, noted that of Morgan's third-quarter write downs, $726 million was related to $31 billion in acquisition financing commitments in its pipeline. The value of these loans fell during the quarter as investors withdrew from credit markets and the logjam of debt deals grew. Morgan Stanley itself pulled in its horns during the period, as shown by a nearly 10 percent decrease in daily average value at risk to $84 million at the end of August. "We decreased our positions," Sidwell said. Kelleher cautioned that the market is not completely out of the woods yet. "You never saw the capitulation that took place after past sell-offs, so you may see some selling into strength by people with positions that were under water," he said. It's too early to say what Tuesday's Federal Reserve interest rate cut will mean for credit markets, the executives said, but the easing move could help increase the confidence of investors who took their cash and fled to the sidelines. "It's a very good first step," Kelleher said. "We're seeing improved flows, we've seen some buying of leveraged loans. It's all part of the healing process." And while the credit crunch spawned fears that takeover activity would slow to a halt, Morgan Stanley's investment banking pipeline remained strong, the executives said. "There is as yet no significant deterioration in our pipelines," Kelleher said. "We're still cautiously optimistic."
