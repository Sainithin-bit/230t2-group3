 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - British Airways BAY.L said on Wednesday it would suspend its daily flight between Detroit and London's Heathrow Airport in March, citing the changing nature of the U.S. auto industry. 

 The aircraft will be used on other, more profitable routes, the airline said. British Airways has operated the route for more than 50 years, but was not able to make a reasonable level of profit and sees no possible upswing, the carrier said. "Detroit was a route very dependent on the auto industry, and the changing nature of this sector made it a very challenging market to be in," Robin Hayes, British Airways executive vice president Americas, said in a statement.
