 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - General Mills Inc ( GIS.N ), the world's second-biggest maker of breakfast cereal, on Wednesday said profit rose 8.2 percent, helped by a move to reduce the size of cereal boxes and charge consumers more per ounce. 

 General Mills hasn't been hurt by the market volatility that has recently affected other companies since basic food items such as cereal are unlikely to disappear from household budgets, General Mills Chief Operating Officer Ken Powell told Reuters in an interview. "People eat, and food is a very good value in the United States," Powell said. "In terms of the grocery store market basket, we really don't see much trading around" from higher- to lower-priced items. Net income was $289 million, or 81 cents per share, compared with $267 million, or 74 cents per share, a year ago. The maker of Cheerios cereal, Pillsbury dough and Progresso soup said earlier this month it expected to earn 81 cents a share, including restructuring costs. On a comparative basis, Wall Street analysts on average expected earnings of 79 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. General Mills, like many other food companies, has been spending more on marketing to help boost sales. At the same time, it has been pressured by rising costs for commodities like corn, dairy products and energy. To help offset those costs, General Mills recently decreased the size of its cereal boxes and trimmed box prices, but not as much as it cut box size. As a result, it is now charging consumers more per ounce of cereal. This year is "a bit more challenging than planned for, so we are much more focused on productivity" to try to avoid further price hikes, Powell said. Analysts said the price hikes didn't appear to hurt General Mills at the checkout lane. "Despite our concerns about the potential impact from the cereal resizing strategy, the impact on total profitability was minimal," wrote JPMorgan analyst Pablo Zuanic in a research note. "If there was an impact from resizing, this was offset by improved mix in the rest of the portfolio." The Minneapolis-based company said sales rose 7 percent to $3.07 billion. Analysts, on average, had forecast sales of $3 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Operating profit rose 6 percent to $473 million. U.S. retail segment sales rose 6 percent in the quarter, and sales of Big G cereals, which include Cheerios, Lucky Charms and Wheaties, rose 5 percent. General Mills affirmed its fiscal-year outlook for low single-digit sales growth, mid single-digit growth in segment operating results and full-year profit of $3.39 to $3.43 per share. Analysts expect a full-year profit of $3.45 per share on revenue of $13 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. General Mills shares were little changed, down 24 cents to $58.43 on the New York Stock Exchange in morning trade. The stock has gained about 1.9 percent so far this year, compared with a rise of about 12.7 percent in shares of rival Kellogg Co ( K.N ).
