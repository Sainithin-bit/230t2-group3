 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - Schlumberger Ltd ( SLB.N ) posted a better-than-expected jump in quarterly profit on Friday and the world's largest oilfield services company gave an upbeat outlook for energy companies' spending on oil and gas exploration that helped push its shares up 4 percent. 

 Schlumberger and others in the sector have benefited from robust demand for their services as energy producers strive to boost output to take advantage of the prolonged rally in crude oil and natural gas prices. Citing customer response to higher prices, Schlumberger Chief Executive Andrew Gould repeated his longer-term view that the global exploration and production spending cycle would stay "stronger for longer." Looking to 2009, Gould told analysts on a conference call that he expects Schlumberger's international revenue to climb more than 20 percent in 2009, above analysts' current estimates. "The market liked what it heard," Kurt Hallead, oilfield services analyst with RBC Capital Markets, said. "The outlook was very bullish and the Street is going to have to increase their international revenue growth rates." Schlumberger said second-quarter profit increased to $1.42 billion, or $1.16 a share, from $1.26 billion, or $1.02 per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $6.75 billion from $5.64 billion. The results topped analysts' expectations for earnings of $1.13 per share on revenue of $6.5 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Bill Herbert, analyst with Simmons & Co, told clients in a note that this was a "redemptive quarter for Schlumberger ... as the company delivered very strong international oilfield results, which more than offset weaker than expected North American results and relatively in-line seismic." Schlumberger's North American revenue met his expectations, but margins were "considerably weaker," Herbert said. Operating profit rose 13 percent to $1.7 billion at Schlumberger's oilfield services arm, but fell 9 percent to $196 million at the WesternGeco seismic unit. Profit in the seismic unit was hurt by seasonal vessel movement and transfers. In North America, revenue rose 7 percent to $1.44 billion, while pretax operating income climbed 18 percent to $344 million, helped by growth in onshore drilling. On the call with analysts, Gould said the company was seeing inflationary pressure worldwide, but especially in North America where exploration and production companies have accelerated drilling activity to take advantage of higher oil and gas prices. Still, Gould assured investors the company has some pricing power in North America in the near term. He declined to give his view of that market for 2009, saying it was too early. Schlumberger's revenue from work in Europe, Africa and Russia soared 28 percent to $2.07 billion as pretax operating income was up 26 percent to $583 million. In the Middle East and Asia, revenue climbed 19 percent to $1.44 billion, and pretax operating income jumped 23 percent to $525 million, boosted by activity in China, Korea and Australia. The stock was up $3.87 at $100.65 on the New York Stock Exchange in late morning trading. At Thursday's close, Schlumberger shares had dipped 1.6 percent this year, lagging a 1.2 percent gain in the Philadelphia Oil Service index .OSX.
