 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve can not wait until 
financial and housing markets stabilize before raising interest 
rates, Minneapolis Fed President Gary Stern said in an 
interview with Bloomberg on Friday. 

  Stern, a voter on the policy-setting Federal Open Market 
Committee this year, said that "headline inflation is clearly 
too high," and could feed through to core prices.  "We're pretty well positioned for the downside risks we 
might encounter from here ... I worry a little bit more about 
the prospects for inflation," he added.  (Reporting by  Ros Krasny )
