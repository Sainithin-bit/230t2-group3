 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - The chief executive officer of oilfield services company Schlumberger Ltd ( SLB.N ) on Friday said he expected revenue growth in the company's international markets to top 20 percent in 2009. 

 "I have no reason to believe that it won't be above 20 percent," Schlumberger CEO Andrew Gould said in response to an analyst question on the company's second-quarter earnings conference call. The executive also said inflationary pressures are growing worldwide, but particularly in North America, where a ramp-up in drilling is accelerating the trend. Shares of Schlumberger climbed 3.3 percent, or $3.17, to $99.95 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by  Anna Driver  in Houston, editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
