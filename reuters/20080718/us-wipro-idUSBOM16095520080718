 BANGALORE  (Reuters) - Indian information technology outsourcers Wipro ( WIPR.BO ) and Satyam SATY.BO posted higher quarterly profits, but said the business outlook was cloudy due to slowing Western economies, sending their shares lower. 

 Wipro Ltd, the country's No.3 software services exporter, on Friday missed forecasts with a 15 percent rise in quarterly profit, while its smaller rival, Satyam Computer Services Ltd, beat forecasts with a 45 percent surge in earnings. But both firms were cautious about outsourcing prospects in the near term, as major U.S. clients battle weakening economies and skyrocketing oil prices. "The current situation hasn't improved compared to last quarter, particularly in the financial services sector," Wipro's Chief Financial Officer Suresh Senapaty said. "Some of the U.S. banks are in trouble, so the uncertainty has still not disappeared." Wipro's shares closed 3.8 percent lower at 365.55 rupees, after sinking as much as 6.5 percent, while Satyam stock ended 7.5 percent lower at 382.95 rupees, after tumbling nearly 10 percent. Other software stocks also fell. The main Mumbai index  .BSESN  rose 4 percent, while the sector index  .BSEIT  dropped 2.6 percent. "The very cautious guidance is not helping. Sentiments have been hit and investors are dumping the stocks," said Jayesh Shroff, fund manager at SBI Mutual Fund. Wipro Ltd ( WIPR.BO ), majority-owned by its billionaire Chairman Azim Premji, forecast its IT services revenue this quarter would rise 2 percent from April-June to $1.09 billion, less than a 3.5 percent sequential rise in the June quarter. In the June quarter, Wipro received a quarter of its revenue from financial services companies. But the firm expects prospects to improve in the second half of the financial year ending in March 2009, as overseas clients look to cut costs and boost efficiency amidst slowing economies. Wipro was also confident of maintaining or improving margins for the full year, despite an "adverse impact" from wage hikes in the September quarter, thanks to improved pricing and a strong pipeline of orders, Senapaty said. The firm, which offers system integration, software application development and back-office services, said net profit rose to 8.14 billion rupees ($190 million) in its fiscal first quarter to June, from 7.10 billion a year ago, under U.S. accounting rules. Profit was hurt by a drop of 272 million rupees in other income, as compared to a gain of 991 million rupees a year ago. A Reuters poll had forecast a net profit of 9.02 billion rupees for Bangalore-based Wipro, which counts telecoms gear makers Cisco ( CSCO.O ), Credit Suisse ( CSGN.VX ), Nortel NT.N and Nokia Siemens Networks NSN.UL among its clients. Revenue rose 42.5 percent to 59.62 billion rupees, as it added 31 clients during the quarter. Bangalore-based Wipro added just 108 staff in the June quarter, compared with 3,811 in January-March and 5,225 a year ago. Analysts said this was a sign of slowing outsourcing demand. But Senapaty said Wipro was focusing on boosting efficiency of its existing staff and headcount additions were not a reflection on the earnings growth. Wipro's earnings ( WIT.N ) follow results from bigger rival Tata Consultancy Services ( TCS.BO ), which narrowly missed forecasts, and second-ranked Infosys Technologies ( INFY.BO ) INFY.O, which beat estimates. The two larger rivals have also warned of challenging times ahead. "We are yet to see clear and consistent signals emanating from the banking and financial services sector, which continues to be fluid," Satyam Chairman B. Ramalinga Raju said. "The direction is not clear ... We have not seen any cancellations, but decision-making appears fluid." Comparatively, cheaper wages had helped Indian outsourcers ride an outsourcing boom for years, but the growth slowed last year when Wall Street banks took a hit from the subprime crisis and as the U.S. economy lurched towards recession. Although Indian outsourcers are rapidly expanding to Europe, Asia and the Middle East to cut their dependence on the United States, the country still accounts for roughly half their sales. New York-listed Satyam SAY.N, which specializes in business software and offers back-office outsourcing services, said consolidated net profit for the quarter rose to 5.48 billion rupees ($128 million), beating a forecast of 5.08 billion. The company, which added 34 clients in the June quarter, said it expects full-year margins to improve by about 50 basis points, despite an impact of about 3-3.5 percent on margins in the September quarter from wage increases. India's software and back-office services export growth will slow to 21-24 percent in 2008/09 from 29 percent a year ago, lobby group National Association of Software and Service Companies said this month.
