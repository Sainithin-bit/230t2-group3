 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The regulator for Freddie Mac FRE.N said on Friday that it was pleased with the mortgage finance company's commitment to raise capital and its registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

 The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, which regulates Freddie Mac and its sibling Fannie Mae FNM.N said it is "pleased with Freddie Mac's Securities and Exchange Commission filing today and with the progress it reflects." Freddie Mac has promised to raise $5.5 billion in fresh capital once it is registered with the SEC. "Their commitment to stronger capital is appropriate and prudent," OFHEO said in a statement.
