 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Freddie Mac filed its application to register its shares with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday, a company spokesman said, in a move that will clear the way for the mortgage-finance company to raise fresh capital. 

 "This is our registration to formally file our common stock," a Freddie Mac spokesman said. The government-sponsored mortgage company had promised to raise $5.5 billion in fresh capital but only after registering with the SEC. An approval from the regulator could come as soon as later Friday morning. (Reporting by Patrick Rucker; Editing by Theodore d'Afflisio)
