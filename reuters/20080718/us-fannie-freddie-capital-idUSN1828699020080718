 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Freddie Mac FRE.N, the second-largest provider of funding for U.S. residential mortgages, on Friday said it has no immediate plans to raise capital. 

 The McLean, Virginia-based company earlier on Friday said it was committed to raising $5.5 billion of fresh capital through offerings including common and preferred stock. The fund raising would not be immediate, a spokeswoman said. (Reporting Patrick Rucker in Washington; Writing by  Al Yoon ; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
