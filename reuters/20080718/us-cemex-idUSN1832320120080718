 MONTERREY, Mexico  (Reuters) - Mexico's Cemex ( CX.N ) ( CMXCPO.MX ), the world's No. 3 cement maker, is seen reporting a 7.9 percent fall in second-quarter net profit on Tuesday as it pays off debt after a big takeover last year. 

 Five analysts polled by Reuters forecast, on average, net profit of $563 million, compared to $611 million in the year-earlier second quarter. The analysts said Monterrey-based Cemex, which operates in more than 50 countries, faced higher costs from its $16 billion takeover last year of Australia's Rinker. That takeover also increased Cemex's holdings in the United States, the company's top market, as the housing sector faces its worst slump in decades and many low-income borrowers fail to repay their mortgages. "We expect a steep decline in net income due to the higher financial costs related to the financing of the acquisition of Rinker," said Gonzalo Fernandez, an analyst at Mexico City-based Santander. Cemex said in June its sales for the second quarter would be around $6.4 billion -- in line with analyst estimates -- a 31 percent rise on the same period a year ago. Cemex began including Rinker operations in its earnings reports from the third-quarter of last year. Cemex also faces slowing markets in Europe, as decade-long economic booms in Spain and the United Kingdom stumble and housing markets there weaken. Cemex competes globally with Switzerland's Holcim ( HOLN.VX ) and France's Lafarge ( LAFP.PA ). (Reporting by Gabriela Lopez; editing by Carol Bishopric)
