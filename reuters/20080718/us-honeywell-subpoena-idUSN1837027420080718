 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Honeywell International Inc ( HON.N ) said on Friday its employees received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice related to a March lawsuit charging that it and 11 other automotive filter manufacturers had conspired to fix prices. 

 That suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Connecticut, and others like it are seeking class-action status, Honeywell said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. "We intend to vigorously defend the claims raised in all of these actions," Honeywell said in the filing, adding that it is cooperating with the Justice Department's investigation.
