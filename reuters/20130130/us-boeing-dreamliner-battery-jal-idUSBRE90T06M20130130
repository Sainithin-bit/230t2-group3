 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan Airlines Co Ltd ( 9201.T ) said it had replaced batteries on Boeing Co's ( BA.N ) 787 Dreamliner on a few occasions, but declined to give specifics on when the units were replaced or whether they were reported to authorities. 
 All Nippon Airways Co Ltd ( 9202.T ) said on Wednesday that it had replaced 10 below-par lithium-ion batteries on 787 jets in the months before one of the passenger jets was forced to make an emergency landing due to an overheated battery triggering smoke alarms.
