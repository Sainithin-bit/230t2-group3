 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's transport ministry said the manufacturing process at the maker of the monitoring unit for Boeing Co ( BA.N ) Dreamliner batteries did not appear to be linked to the battery problem on an All Nippon Airways- ( 9202.T ) operated 787 that made an emergency landing in western Japan this month. 
 The global fleet of 50 Dreamliners - 17 of which are operated by ANA - remains grounded as investigators in Japan and the U.S. try to find out what caused one battery to catch fire on a Japan Airlines Co ( 9201.T ) 787 at Boston's Logan Airport earlier this month, and a second battery to burn on the ANA domestic flight.
