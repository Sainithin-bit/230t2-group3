 GRUGLIASCO, Turin  (Reuters) - Italian carmaker Fiat ( FIA.MI ) Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne said on Wednesday that the Italian and European car markets have perhaps not yet hit bottom and will slump for the sixth year in a row in 2013. 
 "The Italian and European car markets are in a free fall and perhaps have not yet hit bottom," said Marchionne, who is also the chief executive of Chrysler, at the opening of a new factory outside Turin. Italian car sales are seen falling about 25 percent in January from the same month a year ago when figures are released on Friday, continuing last year's slump to the lowest level in over 30 years.
