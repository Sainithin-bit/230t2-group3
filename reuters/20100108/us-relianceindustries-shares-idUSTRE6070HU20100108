 MUMBAI  (Reuters) - Shares in energy major Reliance Industries were choppy in early trade on Friday morning, after a newspaper report said the company has recently sweetened its offer to buy a controlling stake in bankrupt LyondellBasell . 

 Reliance's new offer has pushed its valuation of Lyondell to about $13.5 billion, up from $12 billion in an initial bid made in November, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter. At 0335 GMT, Reliance, India's top listed firm, was trading flat at 1,105 rupees, after falling 0.5 percent earlier. The Mumbai market was up 0.2 percent.
