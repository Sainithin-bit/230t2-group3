 LONDON  (Reuters) - Formula One motor racing boss Bernie Ecclestone is part of a bid to buy General Motors' GM.UL struggling Swedish carmaker Saab, the BBC reported on Friday. 

 Ecclestone has joined forces with Luxembourg-based private investment company Genii Capital, which recently invested in Renault's ( RENA.PA ) Formula 1 team, the report said. GM has been trying to sell Saab for a year, and a deadline for bids expired overnight with reports that at least three bids were submitted, including one from small Dutch luxury carmaker Spyker SPYKR.AS. GM has said it will close the 60-year old company if a suitable bid isn't received, and as recently as Wednesday GM Chief Executive Ed Whitacre said he was "not confident" of reaching a deal.
