 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama Friday awarded $2.3 billion in tax credits, which will be matched by as much as $5.4 billion in private sector funding, to help create clean energy manufacturing jobs. 

 The funding will provide a 30 percent tax credit for investments in 183 manufacturing facilities that make clean energy products in 43 states. Qualifying manufacturing facilities include the production of a wide range of clean energy products: * Solar, wind, geothermal, or other renewable energy equipment. * Electric grids and storage for renewables. * Fuel cells and microturbines. * Energy storage systems for electric or hybrid vehicles. * Carbon dioxide capture and sequestration equipment. * Equipment for refining or blending renewable fuels. * Equipment for energy conservation, including lighting and smart grid technologies. * Plug-in electric vehicles or their components, such as electric motors, generators, and power control units. * Other advanced energy property designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions may also be eligible as determined by the Treasury Department. The criteria used to select winning projects was based on: * Greatest domestic job creation (direct and indirect). * Greatest net impact in avoiding or reducing air pollutants or emissions of greenhouse gases; lowest cost of energy. * Greatest potential for technological innovation and commercial deployment. * Shortest project time from certification to completion.
