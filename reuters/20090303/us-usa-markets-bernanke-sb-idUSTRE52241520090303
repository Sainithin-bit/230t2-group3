 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Pending sales of existing U.S. homes fell sharply in January, with an industry index dropping to a record low, according to a report on Tuesday that showed the deteriorating economy was keeping buyers on the sidelines. 

 Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Tuesday urged bold government action to pull the economy out of a deepening slump, even if it means a surge in federal debt. KEY POINTS: PENDING HOME SALES * The National Association of Realtors Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed in January, plunged 7.7 percent to 80.4, the lowest since the NAR started tracking the series in 2001. * Compared with the same period a year ago, pending home sales were down 6.4 percent in January. * Economists polled by Reuters had forecast pending home sales to fall 3.0 percent in January. December's pending home sales index was revised down to 87.1 from 87.7. BERNANKE * Bernanke: More needs to be done to attain financial stability * Bernanke: whether more funds needed for US financial bailout depends on bank stress tests, economy COMMENTS: CARY LEAHEY, ECONOMIST, DECISION ECONOMICS, NEW YORK: HOME SALES: "The pending home sales report was bad. People were expecting a sizable decline, but the decline was twice as large as expected. This is at the heart of the idea that the economy is taking a second leg downward. Home inventories are not that high, they are just high relative to the pace of sales. BERNANKE: "Bernanke does not appear to be breaking any new ground. He spoke twice to Congress last week when he was quite pessimistic about the outlook this year and said recovery was almost entirely dependent on an adequate thawing out of the credit markets." OMER ESINER, SENIOR MARKET ANALYST, RUESCH INTERNATIONAL, WASHINGTON: "The euro had been selling off ahead of the U.S. data and Bernanke's comments. The stock market had also pared its gains ahead of those two events, so we have seen the dollar gain a little bit. The pending home sales, which were worse than expected, did help the dollar as it just heightens the downturn and increases the market's risk aversion. Bernanke's comments, on the other hand, are positive for the dollar in the short term because it suggests the government is doing all it can to get us out of this crisis. But in the long run, his comments are dollar-negative." MICHELLE MEYER, ECONOMIST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL, NEW YORK: "The pending home sales data was disappointing. We saw a reversing of the increase observed in December. Fundamentally, demand for housing is still very weak, but there is some price discovery going on. Mortgage rates have come down, but only for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgages. Jumbo mortgage rates remain elevated. The data definitely supports the view that home sales will remain depressed over the next few months. There are still questions out there on when we will start to see the impact of the government's housing plan." CHRISTOPHER LOW, CHIEF ECONOMIST, FTN FINANCIAL, NEW YORK: BERNANKE TESTIMONY: "There is no surprise on the bank rescue stuff. I can't disagree with anything here. The recession will get worse before it gets better. The stimulus will work slowly in the next two years. The Fed will remain accommodative for a long time because there is no threat of inflation. "We were all hoping to hear more about TALF but that's not fair because that's not what he was invited to talk about. "Unlike Greenspan, Bernanke doesn't want to get involved in the budget process." PENDING HOME SALES: "There is weakness everywhere except for the West. There are fears of more price declines." "I continue to hold out hopes that prices will stabilize this year. But the issue now is the unemployment rate; the pool of potential buyers has shrunken. There is now a significant climb in prime mortgage delinquencies." "If TALF had come last October when existing home sales had stabilized, it would have been really helpful. But with home prices and sales are back to free-fall, the program is less effective." SUBODH KUMAR, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, SUBODH KUMAR & ASSOCIATES, TORONTO: "I don't think the weakness in home sales is much of a surprise, and today the markets will be focusing more on the testimony from Bernanke and Geithner. "I think the testimony will be focusing on how the Federal Reserve will assist liquidity in the market. That's the most important thing. The market also wants to hear more signals from the Treasury as to what its precise policies will be in terms of helping the financials. The more clarity, the more the markets will like it." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. equity indexes pare gains. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices extending losses. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar erases losses versus euro.
