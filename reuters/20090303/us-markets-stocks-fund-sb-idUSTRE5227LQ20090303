 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks, which plunged to a 12-year low on Monday, have yet to hit a bottom, with the S&P 500 index possibly declining to a level between 500 and 550 points this year as a global recession worsens, said John Taylor, chairman and chief investment officer at FX Concepts. 

 FX Concepts is the world's largest currency hedge fund with assets under management of about $14 billion. Taylor told Reuters in December he expects the S&P 500  .SPX  to fall to around 500 points by July. He has partly raised his forecast since then. But despite deep problems in the U.S. financial sector, Taylor has not lost faith in the banking system and said he would buy bank stocks again because the rate spreads have become profitable. Taylor spoke to Reuters on Tuesday about the state of the financial markets and what he's buying and selling: Reuters: Are U.S. stocks at a bottom? Taylor: "We are definitely not at the bottom. Stocks may be at their two- to three-week bottom, but they're definitely going lower. I am sticking to my 500-550 forecast for the S&P 500. "The problem is that valuations are still going down. The earnings are going down and the dividends are being cut. So it looks like stocks are going to look like they're not worth that much." Reuters: Are U.S. stocks cheap or oversold? Taylor: "No, they're not oversold. In a two- to three-week range and if you're a speculator, they are probably oversold. But if you're a long-term investor, stocks are not oversold." Reuters: What are you buying? Taylor: "For the portfolio, we're only buying indexes. We're still buying three- to five-year governments, mainly G10. We are buying them because interest rates are still going down and we're going to be in this recession longer. But you have to go far out in the curve in order to get some value. "We are buying dollars, even though there is no yield. But we also like the Turkish lira precisely because of its yield. "We're also buying oil. As soon as the economy picks up and I do believe it's going to pick up, I believe oil will recover. These things are going to be worth something because if emerging markets come back and they will come back strongly, commodities and oil are going up." Reuters: What are you selling? Taylor: "We are selling the yen. We are selling all Asian and Eastern European currencies. We are also short gold." Reuters: Will growing government involvement in private companies eventually lead to value returning to the marketplace, or has U.S. involvement killed value permanently? Taylor: "I think it will create value. The problem with all this great argument that ... 'Oh gee whiz, they should cut taxes and give the money to the people'...is that people are scared to death. And people aren't investing in anything. "I think going in and investing in these troubled companies is the right way for the government to do it. But the hard part is going to come much later." Reuters: Will you ever buy a bank stock/bond again? Taylor: "I would buy bank stocks again because the spreads are high; you could make a lot of money. Being a bank now is wonderful because you can start new and you don't have any of those crappy loans on your books. You can make all sorts of loans at good spreads now." Reuters: What is the greatest hurdle facing markets going forward? Taylor: "The problem right now is uncertainty, especially the uncertainty in the financial area. I agree with James Baker in his article in the Financial Times about killing the zombie banks. "The zombie banks are the worst problems. Citigroup ( C.N ) and Bank of America ( BAC.N ) -- they can't make loans anymore. Bank of America may not be as weak as Citigroup, but it's so weak, it doesn't matter. Citigroup is so weak, it's dead three times over. Bank of America may be dead one time over, but it's still dead." (Editing by  Jan Paschal )
