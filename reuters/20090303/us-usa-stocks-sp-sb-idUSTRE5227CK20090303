 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The S&P 500 closed below 700 for the first time since October 1996 on Tuesday as persistent uncertainty about the amount of cash needed to shore up the financial system overshadowed bargain hunting by investors. 

 The close marked the first time the S&P 500 has fallen below the 700 level since October 10, 1996, when it ended at 694.41. Following is a preliminary list of percentage declines by sector in the index year-to-date, followed by the declines since its high of 1,565.15 in October 2007.
