 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The record loss reported by insurer AIG was too much to bear for the S&P 500 index, putting the cumulative earnings for its components on track for a first-ever loss, according to Standard and Poor's. 

 The fourth-quarter operating loss of $44.6 billion reported by American International Group ( AIG.N ) accounted for a $5.13-per-share hit to the index, dragging the operating earnings for the index to a loss of 50 cents per share for the quarter, senior index analyst Howard Silverblatt said Tuesday. AIG on Monday reported a total $61.7 billion loss for the quarter, a record for an American corporation, and $99.29 billion for all of 2008. Of 486 companies that have reported for the quarter, 19 percent have recorded negative operating earnings per share, according to Silverblatt, with 18 of those companies having recorded a "megabillion"-dollar loss. Silverblatt noted that even without AIG, the overall results were already discouraging. "You would've been at an all time low anyway but you wouldn't have been in the red," said Silverblatt. "Even without that, we're still at extreme levels -- historically low levels -- that are reflected in the P/E numbers, and to some degree you have to look beyond that," he said, referring to price/earnings ratios. According to the Thomson Reuters Director's Report dated March 1, using data from the previous Friday, fourth-quarter 2008 earnings for the S&P 500 fell a record 41.7 percent. After the AIG results on Monday, the drop was calculated at 66.5 percent. Further exacerbating the decline were dismal results among financial companies, which accounted for an operating loss of $101.3 billion, according to S&P research. In recent weeks, other analysts have cut their earnings targets for the index in light of the bleak economy. UBS lowered its 2009 earnings per share target to $51 from $63 and its 2010 target to $68 from $82, citing lower normalized S&P earnings power that will likely take longer to restore. The firm believes that most other sectors, apart from financials, in the index should return close to normalized earnings in 2010. Goldman Sachs cut its operating earnings per share view to $40 for 2009 and to $63 in 2010. The firm said they expect operating earnings to fall 56 percent peak-to-trough, which it said would be the third-worst fall in corporate earnings over the past 100 years. (Editing by  Jonathan Oatis )
