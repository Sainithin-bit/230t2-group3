 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The following are highlights of U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner's testimony on Tuesday to the House Ways and Means Committee on the Obama administration's proposed fiscal 2010 budget. 

 GEITHNER ON LACK OF OVERSIGHT OF AIG: "AIG is a huge complex global insurance company attached to a very complicated investment bank hedge fund that was allowed to build up without any adult supervision, without any adequate capital against a reciprocation, putting the government in a terribly difficult position." GEITHNER ON WORLD AFTER AIG BAILOUT: "Today we're in a situation where the world is dramatically worse. You're seeing pressures across more broad parts of the economy than the financial system. Those pressures are facing AIG too. ... The most effective thing to do is to try make sure that that firm can be restructured over a period of time and so that we get through this." GEITHNER ON AIG ACCOUNTABILITY: "It's very important that people understand the assistance we provide is going to come with conditions." GEITHNER ON SIMPLIFYING TAX CODE: "Any effort to ... improve the overall tax code will have to have as part of it efforts to make it more simple to comply. There are a range of opportunities in the tax code." GEITHNER ON POTENTIAL FOR RECOVERY: "I really think there is almost universal agreement that in 2011 our economy will be back on a path of very substantial growth rates. Everything we're doing right now working with Congress is designed to improve that outcome." GEITHNER ON THE COSTS OF DOING NOTHING "This crisis is powerful in part because it comes after a long period in which you had a big boom in credit, people taking risk they didn't understand, people borrowing more than they could afford and governments borrowing beyond their means. That was unsustainable. If as a country we don't move aggressively to get people back to work and provide support for demand and growth, we are going to be living with a longer, deeper recession that will cause much more damage to the American people. Unless we move aggressively, the cost of the crisis will be much more damaging. The choice we are making is a fiscally responsible choice, not just the economically responsible choice. Not doing so will leave us with a longer, deeper recession and with much greater costs to the American people." GEITHNER ON INTENTION TO REDUCE DEFICIT "We have no choice as a country as we try to address the recession, (that) we make people confident here and around the world that we're going to have the will and the ability to bring these deficits down." "The best way for us to sustain confidence in our country is to act to solve these immediate problems we inherited and to try to get the economy back on the path to sustainable growth." GEITHNER ON NEED FOR CREDIT: "You can see this across America as families find it difficult to get the financing they need to buy new houses and cars while businesses have trouble lining up the credit necessary to meet payroll. "The contraction in credit is causing more job losses and further declines in business activity, which, in turn, is adding more pressure on the financial system." GEITHNER ON NEED TO REDUCE BUDGET DEFICITS: "By bringing the deficit down to the range of 3% of GDP, we can keep our national debt - the aggregate total of our past deficits - from growing faster than the economy itself and keep the size of our debt relative to the economy from rising toward the end of our ten year budget window. "Failure to reduce deficits to this level would result in higher interest rates as government borrowing crowds out private investment, leading to slower growth and lower living standards for Americans." GEITHNER ON $250 BILLION PLACEHOLDER: "I should note here that the existence of the $250 billion placeholder for financial stability in the President's Budget does not represent a specific request. Rather, as events warrant, the President will work with Congress to determine the appropriate size and shape of such efforts, and as more information becomes available the Administration will estimate potential cost."
