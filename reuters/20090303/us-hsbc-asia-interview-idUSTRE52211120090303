 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - HSBC Holdings ( 0005.HK ) ( HSBA.L ), which walked away from a $6.3 billion agreement to buy a South Korean bank last year, continues to watch for deals in the country, its Asia chief executive said on Tuesday. 

 Sandy Flockhart also said the UK-based lender remains on the lookout for potential buys in China, India, Indonesia and Taiwan, but said the bank's strategy remains focused on building on its existing platform. "Korea is in an important part of the overall structure we have within Asia," Flockhart told Reuters, a day after HSBC announced a $17.7 billion capital-raising to shore up a balance sheet battered by exposure to the U.S. consumer finance sector. News of the capital raising, alongside a 62 percent drop in 2008 profit and a cut its dividend, sent HSBC's Hong Kong-listed shares down as much as 19.4 percent on Tuesday. The South Korean banking sector is hampered by the concentration of major players over a small number of market segments and a relatively restrictive regulatory environment. "In terms of real growth there, it's difficult organically to do that because there's a lot of very well-structured competitors," Flockhart said. "if we are going to grow in Korea we'd have to do that at some point in time through acquisition, and we just have to see if that opportunity arises." Last year, HSBC abandoned a deal to buy 51 percent of Korea Exchange Bank 004940.KS after delays in winning regulatory approval and as global financial markets worsened. Sung Byung-soo, an analyst at Prudential Investment & Securities, said there is little for HSBC to buy in South Korea. "There isn't any clear candidate for an acquisition right now. Citibank Korea could be put up for sale one day, but it is extremely difficult to raise that possibility now, with what's happening to the company in the U.S.," he said, referring to battered Citigroup ( C.N ). ADAPTING IN OTHER MARKETS HSBC, meanwhile, is adapting in other markets where its footprint is comparatively small. In Japan, Sri Lanka, Thailand and New Zealand, the bank has consolidated its corporate and commercial banking operations over the past 6 or 7 months, Flockhart said. "We're preventing overlap and having a more focused approach to these markets," Flockhart said from his office overlooking Victoria Harbour. HSBC continues to look at potential acquisitions in other key Asia markets, Flockhart said. Since late 2007, for example, it has struck deals to buy banks in Taiwan and Indonesia. "Obviously Taiwan; China, if the opportunities arose there in the fields in which we're interested, insurance and banking; Obviously Indonesia, if we saw opportunities there," he said. "Equally as well in India, if the opportunity arose to obtain a larger footprint, we'd have to consider that," Flockhart said.
