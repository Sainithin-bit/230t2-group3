 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - New U.S. claims for unemployment benefits dipped more than expected last week, a government report showed on Wednesday, signaling continuing amelioration of the struggling labor market. 

 U.S. consumer spending rose for a fourth straight month in October and a key inflation gauge was at a record low, a government report showed on Wednesday, strengthening the Federal Reserve's defense of its decision to loosen monetary policy further. New orders for long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods unexpectedly fell in October to post their largest decline in nearly two years and business capital spending plans dropped, according to a government report on Wednesday that pointed to a slowdown in factory activity. COMMENTS: RUDY NARVAS, SENIOR ECONOMIST, SOCIETE GENERALE, NEW YORK: "Durable goods was weaker than expected, it was disappointing from top to bottom, although there could be some seasonality at play with capital goods ex-aircraft has been doing some funky things the past couple of months. "Spending was a bit weaker than expected, but when you look at it in real terms it actually rose 2.3 percent and that suggests a pretty good handoff from Q3 to Q4, and Q4 consumer spending as far as GDP accounting goes looks like it is going to be pretty good. It is going to carry the strength over from the previous quarter. "Initial claims was better than expected. Overall it was a mixed bag." MICHAEL O'ROURKE, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, BTIG LLC, NEW YORK: "I'm really happy about jobless claims and think a lot of people will be focusing on that today. My expectation has been that we'll drop below 400,000 before the end of the year, and this puts us on a good pace to do so. That would mean that we could add 150,000 jobs per month, which is where we need to be in order to bring the unemployment rate down. "Durable goods were big misses, but there were also big revisions to last month. People will be sorting through all that today. "Personal income and spending were both up, and while spending was a little below expectations it wasn't a big miss and there was an upward revision." TOM PORCELLI, CHIEF U.S. ECONOMIST, RBC SECURITIES, NEW YORK: "You have mixed results. The jobless claims are obviously good news, but you have these really ugly capex numbers. At the end of the day, you are left with a number that's more consistent with mediocre job growth so you may be able to factor that out. The market is not reacting because you have the holiday. People are not willing put in big positions." MARKETS: Stocks: US stock index futures add to gains Bonds: Treasuries hold losses Dollar: Dollar pares gains against euro
