 DUBLIN  (Reuters) - Ireland said on Wednesday a final figure had not been put on its proposed aid package with the EU/IMF but said a figure of 85 billion euros had been discussed. 

 "The size of any program has not been decided but an amount of the order of 85 billion has been discussed," Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen told parliament. "Negotiations are continuing, these talks are proceeding as quickly as possible but we have to see how it can be finalized before government can consider the matter further."
