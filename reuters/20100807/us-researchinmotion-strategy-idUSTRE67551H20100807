 OTTAWA  (Reuters) - For Research In Motion, pragmatism appears to have carried the day once again, as Saudi Arabia let Friday pass without making good on its threat to shut down RIM's BlackBerry Messenger service. 

 Despite reports of temporary interruptions, thousands of BlackBerry users in the kingdom could still access Messenger hours after the government said it would silence it. Analysts say the deadline's passing without incident suggests RIM is willing to cut a deal with governments that want to monitor communications traveling through BlackBerry's famously sealed network. "It seems to me RIM will be pragmatic in working out solutions with these governments and satisfy local laws and at the same time continue to offer the leading security they they've been offering for a number of years," CIBC World Markets analyst Todd Coupland said. Even though RIM struck a defiant stance in the days leading up to the deadline, its negotiators on Friday were discussing with the Saudi telecom regulator a plan to put servers in the country, a source with direct knowledge of the talks said. That could give authorities better access to messages that have been handled exclusively through servers in Canada and the UK. Earlier this week, as a growing group of governments demanded access to RIM's rock-solid encryption on national security grounds, the company insisted that third-party access was impossible. Mike Lazaridis, a RIM founder and its corporate technology guru, came out swinging as the story gathered steam. "Everything on the Internet is encrypted. This is not a BlackBerry-only issue. If they can't deal with the Internet, they should shut it off," he told the Wall Street Journal. Even so, Lazaridis said the company was in discussions with various governments, and that the issue will likely get resolved. "I think they take their lumps in these sort of ... dictatorial nations, and go on from there," Needham & Co analyst Charles Wolf said. "Let's worry about RIM's ability to catch up with iPhone and Android and less about these stupid decisions," he said. The highly publicized tussle has taken some of the shine off this week's launch of the BlackBerry Torch, designed to compete against smartphones from Apple and handsets using Google's Android software. BLACKBERRY NEVER BEFORE BANNED Industry experts and analysts say it is unlikely anyone will ever learn how the company forged a compromise with countries seeking access to data that RIM says it has no way of intercepting. "In the past, when people have made similar threats, either they withdrew completely, without RIM doing anything, or perhaps, behind the scenes, RIM was able to ... come up with a compromise that allowed everybody to go away happy. And that's never publicized," said Duncan Stewart, Deloitte Canada's director of research on technology, media and telecommunications. "Of the very long list of people who have threatened to ban BlackBerries, nobody's actually done it, ever, not once, not even for a minute." In a statement this week, RIM said that claims it has provided unique wireless services or access to any one country are "unfounded." [ID:nWEN8334] "There is only one BlackBerry enterprise solution available to our customers around the world and it remains unchanged in all of the markets we operate in," the company said. Aside from two brief statements and one interview, the tight-lipped company has been particularly quiet this week, only infrequently responding to media questions. "In this case, given that you're dealing with geopolitical concerns, less is more. The less you say and the more you work toward a resolution and state it, the better," Mackie Research Capital Corp analyst Nick Agostino said. SILVER LINING Ultimately, observers say RIM could benefit from the high-stakes row. BlackBerry user Robert McFarlane, who is chief financial officer of Canada's No. 2 phone company, Telus Corp, said countries that ban the service risk becoming a business "backwater." They may also boost RIM's reputation. "If they play it right, from a marketing standpoint, what's going to be reinforced in everyone's minds is that the BlackBerry is so secure that these bad governments are afraid of it. It's actually a selling feature," he said. "I think it's been etched in everyone's mind that BlackBerries are way more secure than iPhones. And I'm not sure everyone understood that before."
