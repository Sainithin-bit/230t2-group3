 ASTANA  (Reuters) - Kazakhstan will announce results on Monday of its hard-going talks with Western companies on delays at the Kashagan oil field, officials said on Saturday, but gave no clue on whether a breakthrough had been reached. 

 The landlocked oil and gas producing nation, five times the size of France, is locked in a dispute with the Eni-led ( ENI.MI ) consortium over cost overruns and production delays at the huge Caspian Sea field -- the biggest oil find in three decades. "The results (of the negotiations) will be announced on Monday," State Secretary Kanat Saudabayev told journalists. "A time has come now when we consider it necessary to establish a parity between Kazakhstan's interests and the interests of our foreign partners, including on the Kashagan issue." He did not elaborate. A source close to the talks said on Friday Kazakhstan was seeking $7 billion in compensation from the Eni-led group for delays at Kashagan. The mammoth field, at the heart of Kazakhstan's ambitious plans to triple oil output by 2017, is due to start pumping oil in 2010, instead of the original 2005 target. Its costs have escalated to $136 billion, from $57 billion. (Reporting by  Maria Golovnina  and Raushan Nurshayeva; Writing by  Dmitry Solovyov ; Editing by  Michael Winfrey )
