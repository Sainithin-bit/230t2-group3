 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Godiva Chocolatier is recalling Christmas chocolates in Asia and Europe after metal fragments were found in some of its products in Japan, an executive from the company said on Saturday. 

 John Holmberg, managing director of the chocolatier in Pacific Rim, told Reuters it was withdrawing one batch of a product as two pieces of metal were discovered last month in two boxes of the chocolate made in France and sold in Japan. "There's been no injuries of any kind...But we thought it best to recall the entire batch just to be on the safe side," he said. "We're investigating the cause of the problem." Godiva Chocolatier is a unit of Campbell Soup Co ( CPB.N ). Holmberg said he was not aware of the overall size of the recall. But Godiva had sold about 300 boxes of the chocolate in Hong Kong and about 40 in Singapore in the last month, he said. (Reporting by  Nao Nakanishi )
