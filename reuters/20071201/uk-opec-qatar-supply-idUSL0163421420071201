 DOHA  (Reuters) - OPEC should tread lightly to avoid flooding the market with oil it will not be able to absorb while at the same time paying heed to concerns about a possible global recession, Qatar's oil minister said on Saturday. 

 "If the market needs more oil, we will be there. This is our job. But ... we have (to) calculate not to create a glut," Abdullah al-Attiyah told reporters on the sidelines of a meeting of Arab oil ministers in Qatar. Asked whether he was worried about the prospects of a global recession, Attiyah said: "I am very concerned." Answering a question on whether he was worried that a recession could hit global demand for oil, he said: "This is also my concern too." The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is under pressure from consumer nations to boost supply to lower prices that last week hit a record high near $100 a barrel. Oil fell more than $2 to below $89 a barrel on Friday, partly on expectations that OPEC will decide to boost output at next week's meeting.
