 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc's ( GS.N ) commercial bank unit plans to open a branch office in London. 
 Goldman filed an application, dated October 8, for a new office of Goldman Sachs Bank USA, to its local regulator, New York's Department of Financial Services (DFS). This would be the first branch outside of the United States for the unit since becoming a commercial bank in 2008, according to the Financial Times, which first reported the news. Goldman Sachs was not immediately available for comment. (Reporting by Ritika Rai in Bangalore; Editing by  Bernard Orr )
