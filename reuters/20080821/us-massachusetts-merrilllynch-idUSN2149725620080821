 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Merrill Lynch agreed on Thursday to buy back about $12 billion in illiquid securities to settle a lawsuit in Massachusetts charging the Wall Street brokerage had defrauded clients in the auction-rate securities market. 

 Massachusetts' secretary of state and top securities regulator, William Galvin, announced Merrill's plans to settle less than a month after his office filed its suit. Merrill, which had a large book of business in the auction-rate securities market in Massachusetts, was accused of misleading its clients about how liquid these securities were and of issuing overly optimistic research on the collapsing market, Galvin said. Merrill spokeswoman Selena Morris declined to comment. Under the agreement, Merrill will start to buy back all illiquid auction-rate securities at par value from customers who have less than $3 million on deposit on October 15, Galvin said in an interview. Merrill will spend $2.1 billion on that. Three months later, Merrill will begin spending an estimated $10 billion to buy back all frozen auction-rate securities from clients with $100 million or less, he added. No decision was reached on fines Merrill will be asked to pay, Galvin said, explaining that he wanted investors to get their money back as soon as possible and did not wish to hold up a settlement over negotiations on fines and fees. "The bottom line was that we didn't want this to drag on," he said in a telephone interview. The deal comes on the heels of a decision by Swiss bank UBS ( UBSN.VX ) to settle with Massachusetts and is the latest in a string of settlements amid a nationwide probe into whether banks sold bonds that were riskier than advertised. "This is a good first step," said Jacob Zamansky, a lawyer who represents Merrill Lynch investors. "But Merrill is far from out of the woods," he added. Auction-rate securities had long been popular with investors for being called as safe as bonds with slightly higher returns. But in February, this $330 billion segment of the credit market seized up, leaving scores of investors stuck with frozen securities. Galvin was among the first state regulators to investigate the scandal and has now settled two of his cases. He is still probing Bank of America ( BAC.N ), the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank which has a huge division in Boston. But he has not sued them yet. Galvin also urged the world's largest mutual fund company, Boston-based Fidelity Investments, to buy back the illiquid securities from investors who purchased them from Fidelity's brokerage unit. Fidelity, another big employer in Boston, said issuers of auction-rate securities should stand behind them and assist customers holding the illiquid securities. Merrill is still under investigation in New York where Attorney General Andrew Cuomo has given the firm until the end of Thursday to settle. Cuomo has not sued Merrill Lynch. Cuomo's office declined to comment. (Additional reporting by  Elinor Comlay  and  Joseph Giannone  in New York. Editing by Jason Szep,  Richard Chang )
