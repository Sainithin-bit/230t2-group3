 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Nissan Motor ( 7201.T ) will begin exporting passenger cars over the next few months from China, as a growing number of global industry giants tap their output in the world's second-largest auto market to supply export markets. 

 Nissan will initially ship 400 Livina hatchbacks and Bluebird Sylphy sedans made at a joint venture plant in south China to Egypt, a company spokesman said on Thursday. It may expand its exports to other markets in the future, he said. The shipment to Egypt will mark the No.3 Japanese automaker's first exports of cars made in China, as it joins other global players taking advantage of the country's lower costs. General Motors ( GM.N ) has sold China-made Chevrolet Lova compact cars to Ukraine and engines to South Korea. Honda Motor ( 7267.T ) exports Fit compact cars, called Jazz in some markets, from a factory in south China. (Reporting by Chang-ran Kim; Writing by Fang Yan in Shanghai; Editing by Edmund Klamann)
