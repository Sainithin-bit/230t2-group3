 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Gap Inc ( GPS.N ) said on Thursday that quarterly net profit rose, helped by higher profit margins, even as sales trends proved disappointing at its three chains. 

 The owner of the Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic chains said second-quarter net profit was $229 million, or 32 cents per share, from $152 million, or 19 cents per share, a ago. Total sales fell to $3.5 billion from $3.69 billion in the quarter. Gap, one of the largest apparel retailers in the world with over 3,000 stores, has been trimming costs, reducing inventory and streamlining operations to shore up its business that has suffered under years of sliding sales due to competition and fashion miscalculations on the part of the company. Shares of Gap are valued at 14 times projected 2009 earnings, in line with the Dow Jones U.S. Apparel Retail Index .DJUSRT, but higher than Limited Brands ( LTD.N ), which has roughly the same amount of stores, and is valued at 12.2 times expected forward-looking earnings.
