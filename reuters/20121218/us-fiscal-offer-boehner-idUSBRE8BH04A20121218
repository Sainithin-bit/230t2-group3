 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Aides to House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner said on Monday the latest White House offer on resolving the fiscal cliff impasse is flawed but moves negotiations in a positive direction. 
 "Any movement away from the unrealistic offers the president has made previously is a step in the right direction, but a proposal that includes $1.3 trillion in revenue for only $930 billion in spending cuts cannot be considered balanced," said Brendan Buck, a Boehner spokesman. "We hope to continue discussions with the president so we can reach an agreement that is truly balanced and begins to solve our spending problem," Buck said.
