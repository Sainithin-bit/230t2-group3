 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Credit market strains deepened 

 on Thursday even as President George W. Bush unveiled a plan designed to extricate U.S homeowners from a worsening mortgage market mess. But as the Bush administration worked to forestall the impact of the credit crisis, more negative news arrived on Thursday. The U.S. asset backed commercial paper sector -- one of many casualties of the housing slide -- shrank for the 17th consecutive week. Meanwhile, home foreclosures and the rate of homes entering the foreclosure process rose to records in the third quarter, a trade group reported, as homeowners struggled with sagging house prices and spiking loan payments. For the second day this week, a country's central bank lowered rates to cope with the credit crunch. The Bank of England lowered its key short-term rate for the first time in more than two years, by a quarter point to 5.5 percent. The Bank of Canada cut its rate on Tuesday. "Conditions in financial markets have deteriorated and a tightening in the supply of credit to households and businesses is in train, posing downside risks to the outlook," the Bank of England said in a statement. The Bush administration's housing plan is aimed at heading off a deepening crisis as an estimated two million homeowners holding adjustable rate loans with low rates facing increases. Officials fear 500,000 Americans could lose their homes. The administration has negotiated a plan with major lenders to freeze those rates. "It is in everyone's interest -- homeowner, servicer, investor -- to develop a market-based approach to avoid foreclosures that are preventable," Paulson said in prepared remarks aimed at deflecting criticism the government might be interfering in the marketplace. Bush, remarking that rising foreclosures would have negative implications for the economy, said his plan could make an estimated 1.2 million homeowners eligible for mortgage assistance under the rate freeze hammered out with mortgage industry chiefs. The Mortgage Bankers Association's chief economist Doug Duncan said on Thursday about 994,000 U.S. households are already in the process of foreclosure. In recent years, mortgages were packaged along with many other kinds of loans into pools for investors. The ensuing debt debacle has spread fears throughout the financial system, sparking fears that repayments could be in jeopardy. That in turn has induced investors to hold onto cash. In the a fresh sign of investors wariness about riskier assets, the U.S. asset-backed commercial paper sector contracted sharply in the latest week and now has fallen about a third in value since August. Asset-backed commercial paper declined for the 17th straight week, down by $23.0 billion to its smallest since the fall of 2005. The shrinking U.S. commercial paper market, reported by the Federal Reserve, showed that a vital source of short-term funding for daily operations at many companies has been vanishing -- reflecting the broad stress in short-term lending markets that first erupted in August. "We are in some ways worse than we were in August," said Howard Simons, strategist with Bianco Research in Chicago. "We have renewed stress in the commercial paper market. We have tighter lending standards. We have wider corporate bond spreads," said Simons. Meanwhile, the London interbank offered rates for one-month sterling rates fell from this week's 9-year high on Thursday while dollar rates eased for a second day. But the signs of calm in the money markets was seen as merely tentative. Money market tightness is being exacerbated by the traditionally illiquid year-end period. While the Bank of England cut interest rates on Thursday, the European Central Bank held rates unchanged at 4.0 percent. Indeed, said ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet, some members of the European Central Bank's Governing Council favored raising interest rates. A cut was not discussed, he said. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut its fed funds target rate by at least 25 basis points at its scheduled policy-setting meeting next week. But central banks' official rate moves may not do much to ease tensions in global money markets, some analysts said. "You can do what you want with the funds rate, but you can do nothing if banks don't want to lend to each other," said Simons.
