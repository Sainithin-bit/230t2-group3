NEW YORK (Reuters) - Costco Wholesale Corp ( COST.O ) on Thursday reported a 9 percent rise in November sales at stores open at least a year. 

 Analysts, on average, had expected the company's same-store sales to rise 6.6 percent, according to Reuters Estimates. Costco, the largest U.S. warehouse club, said total sales in the four weeks ended December 2 rose 13 percent to $5.72 billion. (Reporting by  Emily Chasan ; editing by Sue Thomas)
