 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Upscale department store chain Nordstrom Inc ( JWN.N ) said on Thursday that November sales at stores open at least a year rose 8.7 percent, helped by a calendar shift that added some holiday sales to the November period. 

 Analysts, on average, were expecting store sales to rise 3.6 percent, according to Reuters Estimates. The Seattle-based retailer said preliminary data indicated total sales for the four weeks ended December 1 rose 7.4 percent to $804.9 million. (Reporting by  Brad Dorfman ; editing by John Wallace)
