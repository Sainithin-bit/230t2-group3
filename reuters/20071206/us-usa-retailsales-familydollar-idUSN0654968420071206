 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Discount store chain Family Dollar Stores Inc ( FDO.N ) on Thursday said sales at stores open at least a year fell 3.4 percent in November. 

 Analysts, on average, had been expecting it to post a same-store sales increase of 1.7 percent, according to Reuters Estimates. The company had forecast a 1 percent to 3 percent increase in sales in existing stores. Total sales for the four weeks ended December 1, were $559.3 million, little changed from $560.0 million for the comparable four-week period a year ago. "Macro-economic pressures continue to impact the spending capacity of low and low-middle income consumers," Chief Executive Howard Levine said in a statement. "As our customers struggled to make ends meet in the first quarter of fiscal 2008, we saw sales increases in most consumable categories while more discretionary categories were softer." Levine said the company expects same-store sales to be flat to up slightly in fiscal 2008 as that merchandise mix continues. Family Dollar said it now expects diluted earnings per share between $1.62 and $1.74 for fiscal 2008. Analysts surveyed by Reuters Estimate forecast earnings of $1.79. It expects diluted earnings per share between 36 and 38 cents for the first quarter of fiscal 2008, compared with 36 cents for the year-earlier period. The company also said it expects same-store sales for the December period ending January 5, 2008, to be flat or decline slightly.
