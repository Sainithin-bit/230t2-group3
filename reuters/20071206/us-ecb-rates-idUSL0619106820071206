 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - The European Central Bank is expected to keep interest rates on hold on Thursday and highlight rising inflation risks, resisting a building global bias towards monetary policy easing. 

 In the last month euro zone inflation has gathered pace, while data suggest financial market turbulence and fallout from the U.S. subprime crisis will hit economic growth globally and closer to home, forcing central banks to respond. The Bank of Canada surprised markets with a quarter percentage point rate cut on Wednesday, gloomy British data have fanned expectations that the Bank of England will follow suit also on Thursday, and markets continue to look for another rate cut from the U.S. Fed Reserve on December 11. German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck expressed unease this week over the strong euro, driven by the narrowing rate gap with the United States, and Italy's deputy economy minister Vicenzo Visco said it would be "suicide" if the ECB did not follow the Fed's example and cut rates. But concerns about inflation mean the ECB is unlikely to join the trend, for now at least. Policymakers began their meeting shortly after 0800 GMT (0300 EST), and will discuss a rise in euro zone inflation to a 6-1/2 year high of 3.0 percent in November and new ECB staff projections for the future. The ECB is determined to prevent "second-round" knock-on effects on inflation expectations, wages and future prices of consumer goods from the current spike in monthly inflation. All 72 economists polled by Reuters last week expected no change to rates when the ECB announces its decision at 1245 GMT, and the median expectation is for steady rates throughout 2008. ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet holds a news conference at 1330 GMT to explain the decision and economists expected him to highlight continuing risks to price stability. "Despite the continued problems in money markets and the general lack of confidence in financial markets, Mr Trichet will reiterate the ECB's concerns about longer-term price risks at today's press conference," ABN Amro economist Dario Perkins said. RATE CUT ODDS BUILDING Market nervousness about liquidity into early next year has pushed money market rates to their highest levels since late 2000, despite ECB promises of extra liquidity around the turn of the year. But the ECB has stressed money market operations are separate from monetary policy. Staff are likely to revise up inflation projections for 2008 and trim the economic growth outlook to close to 2 percent from about 2.3 percent seen in September, highlighting the ECB's dilemma on rates. New forecasts will be released for 2009, and economists are keen to see whether inflation is likely to fall back below 2 percent. Risks to growth were highlighted by a weaker than expected rise in retail sales in October and a slide in growth of services sector activity to a 27-month low in November. Slower economic growth and the strong euro should dampen inflation pressures and a growing minority of analysts expect the ECB's next move to be a cut. Forty percent of those polled by Reuters saw at least one rate cut in 2008, almost as many as those who expect rates to remain on hold all year, while only 15 percent still expect another increase. December 2008 Euribor money market rate futures suggest around 75 percent chance of a 25 basis point easing by the end of next year, according to Reuters calculations. One analyst said Eonia interest rate swaps were pointing to around 13 basis points of easing by the end of next year. Lehman Bros has noted a growing divergence in views on the 19-member Governing Council, with more policymakers now expressing concern about the credit crunch and growth. Lehman's Laurent Bilke expects downside concerns about growth to gather pace in the first half of next year, setting the scene for two quarter percentage-point cuts from June. "We now expect the tightening of financing conditions and the deterioration of the international environment to have significant negative effects on the economy," he said.
