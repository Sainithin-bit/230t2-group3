 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Snowmobile and motorcycle maker Polaris Industries Inc has recalled about 330 Ranger utility vehicles because the fuel tank can leak, posing fire and burn hazards, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said on Thursday. 

 The Polaris recall involved U.S.-made 2008 Polaris Ranger RZR 800 EFI Utility Vehicles sold through dealers from August through November 2007 for about $10,300. The company has received four reports of the fuel tank leaking, but none of injuries, the CPSC said. The agency said consumers should stop using the recalled off-road vehicles immediately and contact their local Polaris dealer to arrange for a free inspection and if needed, a free repair. The CPSC also issued a notice on Thursday that Collins International Co of Fair Lawn, New Jersey, recalled about 20,000 oscillating ceramic heaters sold at Menards retail stores due to a fire hazard. The Chinese-made ceramic heaters were sold at Menards stores nationwide from September 2006 through March 2007 for about $25. Collins International has received seven reports of the heaters overheating, smoking or igniting, including four reports of minor damage to carpets and floors, the CPSC said. No injuries have been reported. The CPSC said consumers should immediately stop using the heaters and return them to the nearest Menards store for a full refund.
