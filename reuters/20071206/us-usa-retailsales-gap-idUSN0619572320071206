 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Gap Inc ( GPS.N ) said on Thursday its sales at stores open at least a year were flat in November. 

 Analysts, on average, had been expecting the San Francisco-based clothing retailer to post a same-stores sales decrease of 4.6 percent, according to Reuters Estimates. Gap, which runs Banana Republic, Old Navy, and its namesake Gap stores, said total sales for the four weeks ended December 1 rose to $1.54 billion from $1.39 billion in the same period last year. "While we were pleased with our sales performance in November, the most important month of the quarter, December, remains ahead of us," said acting Gap Chief Financial Officer Sabrina Simmons in a statement. She said the company is maintaining its full-year earnings outlook of 92 to 98 cents per share. Excluding items, the company expects earnings per share of 99 cents to $1.05. By division, Gap North America reported that same-store sales in November increased 1 percent, Banana Republic North America reported a 4 percent increase, and Old Navy North America reported a 3 percent decrease. The international division reported a 1 percent increase in same-stores sales during the period. The company said that the Gap store products continued to gain acceptance with customers, and that kids and babies merchandise performed better than adult merchandise. At Old Navy stores, the company said it saw positive initial customer response to the holiday products, partly due to the strong promotions during Black Friday after the Thanksgiving holiday.
