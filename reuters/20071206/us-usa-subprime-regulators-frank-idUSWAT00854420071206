 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The chairman of the Financial Services Committee of the House of Representatives said Thursday that he supported a plan to aid troubled homeowners but is concerned that the eligibility test is too tough. 

 "With regard to the proposal that the administration has put forward. I welcome it," Rep. Barney Frank said at a hearing to discuss the national mortgage crisis. Still, Frank said he opposed any measure that would exclude some borrowers with relatively strong credit scores from the program. "I think we would be making a great mistake morally and also, frankly, politically if we tell two people who are otherwise similarly situated that the one who has been more careful about his or her credit is not going to get the benefit and people who have been less careful will."
