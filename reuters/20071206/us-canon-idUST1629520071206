 CHIBA, Japan  (Reuters) - Japanese precision equipment and camera maker Nikon Corp ( 7731.T ) is gearing up for a surge in demand for advanced scanners from makers of liquid crystal displays and logic chips, as it braces itself for potential spending cuts from memory makers next year. 

 Nikon, which competes with Netherlands-based market leader ASML Holding ( ASML.AS ) and home rival Canon Inc ( 7751.T ), said on Thursday that it expected strong demand next year for its newest scanners, used to etch circuitry on to microchips and large glass substrates. Orders for the multi-million dollar machines are coming in from panel makers in Taiwan, as well as logic chip makers, said Kazuo Ushida, head of Nikon's precision equipment business. "We're not 100 percent sure why we're getting so many inquiries," Ushida told reporters on the sidelines of Semicon Japan, the world's biggest exhibit of microchip-making equipment. "But we're not complaining." A projected shortage in LCD panels, used in flat-TVs, would be a boon to chip equipment makers. They fear that PC memory makers and foundries, battered by price falls, may cut spending next year, and are waiting for logic chip makers, such as Intel ( INTC.O ), to pick up the slack. Global unit sales of dry ArF (Argon Fluoride) scanners are expected to plummet next year, as memory makers save their money to buy more expensive and advanced immersion scanners that can print smaller circuits onto chips, Canon executives told a group of analysts. Immersion scanners use purified water between the lens and the silicon wafer to increase depth of focus. This allows chipmakers to boost productivity and lower costs, as they cram thinner circuits onto slivers of silicon to enable tinier and more power-efficient cellphones, digital music players and PCs. Canon, which was late to develop immersion scanners, aims for a 30 percent share in the market for the cutting-edge steppers in 2010. But Nikon and ASML, which control the immersion market, are already developing new technologies to lower defect rates and speed up output. One example is Nikon's newest scanners, which do away with the need to apply and remove a protective topcoat layer between the silicon wafer and the scanner. Shares of Nikon closed up 6.8 percent to 3,920 yen, while Canon gained 0.9 percent at 5,840 yen. Tokyo's electrical machinery subindex .IELEC.T gained 2.2 percent. (Editing by Malcolm Whittaker)
