 LONDON  (Reuters) - Moody's Investors Service warned on 
Thursday the global default rate would rise sharply in 2008, to 
4.2 percent by the end of the year, as the credit turmoil 
constrains access to funding and the economy slows. 

  If there is a U.S. recession, then default rates could rise 
to "near double-digit levels," the ratings agency said in a 
statement, although it said its forecasts were based on a 
slowing economy, not a recession.  In November, the global "junk" bond default rate was 1.0 
percent, the lowest level for 26 years, Moody's said, and down 
from 1.9 percent a year ago.  "Currently low default rates reflect the easy credit 
conditions of the past couple of years which allowed most 
issuers to refinance on favourable terms, and strong economic 
growth which has allowed issuers to make their debt service 
payments," said Kenneth Emery, Moody's director of corporate 
default research.  So far this year, 17 issuers rated by Moody's have 
defaulted, versus 29 in the same period of 2006.  Analysts broadly expect a pick-up in defaults next year, 
but predictions range widely.  Chris Jones, chief investment officer at London-based fund 
of hedge funds Key Asset Management, told Reuters on Wednesday 
he expected default rates in 2008 to return to 2002 levels.  According to Moody's the global default rate hit 8.2 
percent in 2002, as 133 speculative-grade rated borrowers 
defaulted on $143.2 billion of bond and loan debt. In the past 
10 years, the default rate was only higher in 2001, when it hit 
10.6 percent.  (Reporting by Richard Barley; editing by Sue Thomas)
