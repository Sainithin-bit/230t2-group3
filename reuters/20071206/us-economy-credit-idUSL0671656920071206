 LONDON  (Reuters) - Britain's second-biggest bank said it suffered less damage than widely feared from the global credit crisis as investors waited on Thursday for the detail of a rescue plan for U.S. homeowners from President George W. Bush. 

 Financial markets were also braced for pronouncements from the European Central Bank and Bank of England, with the former not expected to ease policy but chances of an interest rate cut from the latter very much in the balance. Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ) said it was on track to beat analysts' forecasts with 2007 profits of over 10 billion pounds ($20.4 billion) after a lower-than-expected fall in the value of assets as a result of this year's credit crunch. Writedowns would total 1.25 billion pounds, which the bank said should capture its total loss. Reports had predicted losses of as much as 1.9 billion. "There is an allowance for a deterioration and getting worse from here ... so there would only be an additional provision if the future trajectory of delinquency got materially worse from where it is now," said RBS CEO Fred Goodwin. European shares rallied in response, with bank stocks leading the way. President George W. Bush will later unveil a plan to prevent a wave of home loan foreclosures that has threatened to knock the U.S. economy into recession. The plan hammered out by the Treasury Department with mortgage industry leaders would bring relief to many of the 2 million homeowners who took out adjustable rate loans with low rates which will soon move sharply higher. Officials fear 500,000 Americans could lose their homes without the initiative, which is designed to temporarily hold rates steady for subprime borrowers. Bush will outline the plan at 1:40 p.m. EST. The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said the U.S. economy faces a severe chill next year from at least another 6 months of falling housing market activity but is likely to avoid recession. A separate U.S. plan to ease the impact of the credit crisis may be diluted. The three U.S. banks assembling a "super fund" aimed at alleviating the global credit crunch are scaling back its size due to a lack of interest from the financial firms it's supposed to help, the Wall Street Journal said in its online edition. The fund -- originally viewed as a $100 billion fund which would buy assets from struggling investment vehicles -- may now end up being half that size, the Journal said, citing sources. Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ), Citigroup Inc ( C.N ) and JPMorgan Chase Co ( JPM.N ) are spearheading an effort to raise billions of dollars for the fund that is supposed to help structured investment vehicles sell hard-to-value paper they hold without further unnerving already jittery credit markets. GERMANS HIT TOO German state-backed lender WestLB WDLG.UL said the global credit market turmoil would push it into a pretax loss for the year in a low three-figure million-euro amount. WestLB reported a pretax loss of 116 million euros ($171 million) for the first nine months of the year and said market conditions had become worse in October and November. Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ) Chief Executive Josef Ackermann said the credit crisis was not over yet but the United States should avoid recession while European economies should slow only moderately. "Money market costs have risen significantly," Ackermann said in a speech at the University of Zurich late on Wednesday. "The problem is that banks don't want to take risks at the year-end and hoard liquidity. The next weeks will be very, very difficult again." With subprime mortgages -- lent to people ill-equipped to pay them back -- bundled up into complex financial products and sold on around the globe, uncertainty about where the exposure lies remains intense, causing interbank lending to dry up. Money market tightness is being exacerbated by the traditionally illiquid year-end period. Moody's Investors Service said a capital shortfall at U.S. bond insurer MBIA Inc ( MBI.N ) was "somewhat likely", sending its shares tumbling and pushing debt protection costs higher. A review of MBIA's residential mortgage-backed portfolio showed it was at greater risk of falling short of capital needed for a top "triple-A" rating than earlier believed, Moody's said in a statement on Wednesday.
