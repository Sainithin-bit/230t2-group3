 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Costco Wholesale Corp ( COST.O ) on Thursday reported a 9 percent rise in November sales at stores open at least a year, helped by an increase in gasoline prices, strength in foreign currency and more shoppers coming into its warehouse clubs. 

 Analysts, on average, had expected the company's same-store sales to rise 6.6 percent, according to Reuters Estimates. Costco, the largest U.S. warehouse club, said total sales in the four weeks ended December 2 rose 13 percent to $5.72 billion. On a recorded call, Costco said results were boosted by strength in foreign currency, especially in Canada and the United Kingdom, and higher gasoline prices. The average price per gallon of gasoline in November was $3.01, up from $2.22 a gallon last year, it said. Without the higher gasoline prices, U.S. same store sales would have risen 4 percent, Costco said. November same-store sales in its international division jumped 21 percent, while they advanced 6 percent in its U.S. division. November sales were strong in its deli and cooler business, sporting goods, health and beauty, toys and automotive, TV unit sales were strong, but Costco said its overall results weakened as prices declined from a year ago. Sales were also soft in small appliances and home furnishings. (Reporting by  Emily Chasan  and  Nicole Maestri , editing by Derek Caney)
