 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A gauge of U.S. online labor demand fell in November due in part to declining consumer confidence, which made a dent in online offerings for retail and leisure positions, a report showed on Thursday. 

 Monster, a global online careers and recruiting firm, said its Employment Index fell to 183 points in November, from 188 in October. It was 175 a year ago. "This marks the first time since its inception (in 2004) that the Index has declined during the month of November," said Steve Pogorzelski, a vice president at Monster Worldwide, in a statement. He added that low consumer confidence amid economic uncertainty is making employers cautious about their near-term hiring plans. "Nevertheless, the Index remains eight points higher year-over-year and there are still pockets where demand for workers was strong last month." The report showed online offerings for sales and related occupations declined in November, "reflecting a cautious retail hiring environment as U.S. consumer confidence dipped to a two-year low." Online job demand declined in all nine U.S. census regions, with the East South Central region registering the widest decrease rate. The Monster Employment Index comes ahead of the U.S. Labor Department's initial claims for jobless benefits, due later on Thursday, expected to be at 340,000 according to a Reuters poll of economists. The ADP National Employment report showed on Wednesday U.S. private employers likely added 189,000 jobs in November, nearly four times the expected 50,000 new jobs figure. The Monster Employment Index is a monthly analysis based on a selection of corporate career sites and job boards. The margin of error is approximately plus or minus 1 percent.
