 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The former chief executive of 
UnitedHealth Group Inc ( UNH.N ) will forfeit more than $400 
million in stock options and other compensation and pay a $7 
million fine to settle an investigation into the health 
insurer's options practices. 

  Former CEO William McGuire settled claims with both the 
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the company, which 
had appointed a special committee to investigate shareholder 
claims arising from options pay to top company executives.  The company also announced settlements with former general 
counsel David Lubben and former director William Spears.  The SEC said the settlement with McGuire is the first to 
use the "clawback" provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley corporate 
reform law to deprive a corporate executive of stock sale 
profits and bonuses earned while a company was misleading 
investors.  McGuire had accumulated more than $1.6 billion in stock 
options by the end of 2005. Following UnitedHealth's internal 
report, McGuire agreed to reprice some of those options, 
reducing their value.  Including that repricing, McGuire will have given up more 
than $600 million, the company said.  A special committee, comprised of two former Minnesota 
Supreme Court judges, had been reviewing claims brought against 
certain current and former company officers and directors in 
federal and state derivative lawsuits.  (Reporting by  Martha Graybow  and  Lewis Krauskopf ; Editing
