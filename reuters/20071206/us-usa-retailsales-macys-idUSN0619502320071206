 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Retailer Macy's Inc ( M.N ) on Thursday reported a better-than-expected 13.4 percent rise in November sales at stores open at least one year, aided by holiday promotions and a calendar shift that added sales to the period. 

 Analysts on average were expecting a same-store sales rise of 7.5 percent, according to Reuters Estimates. Macy's, which acquired May Department Stores in 2005 and converted hundreds of those stores to the Macy's name last year, said colder weather also helped November sales. The company forecast that December same-store sales could fall 4 percent to 7 percent, hurt by the calendar shift that added selling days to November. Macy's said it still expects fourth-quarter same-store sales in a range of down 2 percent to up 1 percent. The Cincinnati-based parent of Macy's and Bloomingdale's said total sales were $2.7 billion for the four weeks ended December 1, up 13.9 percent from the year-ago period.
