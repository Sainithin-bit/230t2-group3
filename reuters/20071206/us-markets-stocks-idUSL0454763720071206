 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Stocks surged on Thursday on optimism that a plan announced by President George W. Bush to stem U.S. home foreclosures would keep the economy from sliding into a recession. 

 Bush said as many as 1.2 million homeowners could benefit from the mortgage assistance plan, which includes an interest- rate freeze for some of the most distressed borrowers.  Investors snapped up shares of the companies most punished by the housing slump, including home builders, banks and mortgage lenders. Countrywide Financial Corp CFC.N, the No. 1 U.S. home loan provider, and KB Home ( KBH.N ) , the No. 5 U.S. home builder, each rose 16.1 percent. "The mortgage plan is a diffusion of panic. It neutralizes the panic, and that's really what the market has been reflecting," said Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist at Channel Capital Research, in Shrewsbury, New Jersey. "Right now it looks like more of a slowdown scenario for the economy rather than a situation where we're going to fall off a cliff. At the same time, we're seeing positive vibes from the Federal Reserve." The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  shot up 174.93 points, or 1.30 percent, to end at 13,619.89, a day after it gained nearly 200 points. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  climbed 22.33 points, or 1.50 percent, to 1,507.34. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  soared 42.67 points, or 1.60 percent, to 2,709.03. Shares of energy companies, including Exxon Mobil Corp ( XOM.N ), also fueled the rally, driven higher by a resurgence in crude oil prices back above the $90 a barrel level. 'RESCUE ME' RALLY Countrywide shares, which have plunged 70 percent this year amid the mortgage meltdown, rose 16.1 percent to $12.10 on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares of Fannie Mae FNM.N, the No. 1 U.S. home finance company, also benefited from the optimism about the Bush plan, rising 7.2 percent to $38.74. Shares of KB Home climbed 16.1 percent to $24.25. Builders also got a boost from Toll Brothers ( TOL.N ) after the largest U.S. luxury home builder reported a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss. Toll's shares ended up 13 percent at $23.42. The Dow Jones U.S. home construction index .DJUSHB, which had fallen 52 percent for the year, surged 13 percent -- its biggest one-day jump in at least two years. Among banks, shares of JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ), the No. 3 U.S. bank, gained 2.9 percent to $46.21, while those of Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ), the No. 2 U.S. bank, ended up 1.6 percent at $45.96. Shares of Citigroup Inc ( C.N ), the largest U.S. bank, climbed 2 percent to $34.35. Citigroup, along with Countrywide, finished among the NYSE's top 5 active issues by volume, according to Reuters data. The S&P financial index .GSPF added 2.6 percent. American International Group ( AIG.N ), the world's largest insurer by market value, led financial shares in the Dow and the S&P 500, a day after it said its exposure to the housing and credit crisis was manageable. AIG shares finished up 5.5 percent at $61.35 and ranked No. 1 among the Dow's major advancers. APPLE POLISHING AND CRUDE AWAKENING On the Nasdaq, shares of Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ) led gainers, with a rise of 2.4 percent to $190 after two brokerages raised their price targets for the iPod maker's stock. A rise in crude oil prices also buoyed shares of energy and oil services companies. Exxon Mobil ( XOM.N ) gained 1.7 percent to $91.44 on the NYSE, making it the top contributor to the S&P 500's advance, while those of Chevron Corp ( CVX.N ) gained 2.3 percent to $91.38. U.S. crude for January delivery CLF8 shot up $2.74, or 3.1 percent, to settle at $90.23 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, lifted by supply worries a day after OPEC agreed to leave production quotas in place. It rose more than $3 a barrel in electronic trading after the close amid a weaker dollar and a tight supply picture. Volume was modest on the NYSE, where 1.37 billion shares changed hands, below last year's estimated daily average of 1.84 billion. On Nasdaq, about 2.03 billion shares traded, slightly above last year's daily average. Advancers outnumbered decliners by a ratio of almost 4 to 1 on the NYSE, while on the Nasdaq, nearly three stocks rose for every one that fell. (Editing by  Jan Paschal )
