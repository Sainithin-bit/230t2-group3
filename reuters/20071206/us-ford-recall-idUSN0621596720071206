 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co. said on Thursday it had recalled about 1.2 million vans, sport utility vehicles and heavy-duty pickup trucks because of a flaw in an engine sensor that could cause sudden stalling. 

 In a notice posted with the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration, the No. 2 U.S. automaker said vehicles equipped with a 7.3-liter diesel engine could stall without warning, causing a crash. The recall covers vehicles built between 1997 and 2003 including Ford's E-Series full-size van, the Excursion SUV and the F-450 Super Duty pickup truck. Ford said its dealers would inspect the potentially flawed camshaft sensor in the affected vehicles and replace the part with a new version without charge.
