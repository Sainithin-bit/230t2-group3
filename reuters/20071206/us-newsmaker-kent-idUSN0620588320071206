 ATLANTA/NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Muhtar Kent will rise to the top job at Coca-Cola Co ( KO.N ) next year, expected to stay the course set by his highly regarded predecessor, but for some he may always be under a cloud over a stock deal 11 years ago. 

 Kent, currently chief operating officer at the world's largest soft drink company, will become CEO next July, succeeding Neville Isdell, who will remain chairman until April 2009, the company said on Thursday. Analysts said the 55-year-old Kent, who was born in the United States but has dual U.S.-Turkish citizenship, is expected to build on the turnaround began by Isdell, 64, who came out of retirement to take the top job in 2004. Under Isdell's watch, the maker of Coca-Cola has expanded into other drink categories and taken other steps to stabilize the company as competition with rival PepsiCo Inc ( PEP.N ) intensified. Isdell is also credited with improving the Atlanta-based drink company's culture after the company was roiled by management turmoil and saw its reputation sullied by a 1999 race discrimination suit and regulatory probes. "There's excitement behind the company today that didn't exist a few years ago," said James Senn, director of the Center for Global Business Leadership at Georgia State University's Robinson College of Business. "I believe Muhtar Kent will keep that energy moving and probably even raise the bar on it." Senn said the elevation of Kent, no surprise given his increased visibility with the media and Wall Street as the face of Coca-Cola since he was named operating chief last year, shows Coca-Cola was "back on track" in terms of succession planning. "There are potholes," Senn said, "but Kent and Isdell have got the company moving forward." One friend, Beverage Digest publisher and editor John Sicher, described Kent as a down-to-earth family man who's very competitive but doesn't take himself too seriously. "He's very good at spotting issues and problems and coming up with resolutions," Sicher said. "He has a very, very deep understanding of the business and the relationships that are part of the business." GLOBAL LEADER Kent joined the Atlanta beverage giant in 1978 and held various marketing and operational roles where he oversaw Coke's operations in many countries, including a job as president of Coke's East Central Europe unit. He later was managing director of Coca-Cola Amatil-Europe, part of Australian bottler Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd ( CCL.AX ), but left in 1998 after a 1996 incident when his financial adviser sold short 100,000 shares of Amatil stock just before the company issued a profit warning. He rejoined Coke, and his long-time mentor Isdell, in 2005 as president of the North Asia, Eurasia and Middle East Group. Australian securities regulators and the company investigated the matter. Isdell said on Thursday that the company had no intention of disclosing to the public its report on the incident, despite Kent's new job. "It has been dealt with by the board a long time ago," Isdell said. "As far as the board is concerned, as far as Muhtar and I are concerned, it is history. And it will remain that." "I think we should judge on performance and I think if you look at everything (Kent) has done since he came back it is marked, not only by performance, but also with integrity," Isdell added. Stifel Nicolaus analyst Mark Swartzberg said Isdell and the board have knowledge of and confidence in Kent's character, but that shareholders and others outside the company do not. "We do not know whether Mr. Kent did something wrong and, if he did, whether he has changed accordingly," Swartzberg wrote in a research note. James Berman, founder and president of JBGlobal LLC in New York, a longer-term Coke shareholder, praised Kent's operational performance but tempered it with concern. "From all indications, Kent seems to have done a good job from an operational perspective," Berman said. "The stock has done well." But Berman said until Coke makes its report on the Amatil incident public, rumors will keep swirling. "I think he is under a cloud," Berman said. "He may not have done anything against the best interest of the company, but you really want to make sure as a shareholder." (Editing by  Gary Hill )
