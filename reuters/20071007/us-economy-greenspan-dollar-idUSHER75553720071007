 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said on Sunday he sees no evidence the current decline in the value of the U.S. dollar is causing an acceleration in inflation. 

 In an interview on CNN's "Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer," Greenspan said that normally the long-term weakness of a currency is inflationary. "There is no real evidence right now that that is a major problem," Greenspan said. Americans traveling abroad will feel the effects of the dollar's decline, but as far as the broader impact, Greenspan said: "There is no evidence that it is a significant element at this stage."
