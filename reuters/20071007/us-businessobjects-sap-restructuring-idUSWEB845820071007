 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - SAP ( SAPG.DE ) does not expect any major restructuring following its agreed upon 4.8 billion euro ($6.8 billion) acquisition of Franco-American software group Business Objects BOBJ.PABOBJ.O, its chief executive said. 

 "We will leverage each other's infrastructure," Henning Kagermann said on a conference call on Sunday. "The opportunities on the top line are such that we don't need heavy restructuring. Both companies are growing fast and plan to add positions." ($1=.7088 Euro)
