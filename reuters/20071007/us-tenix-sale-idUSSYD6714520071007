 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Privately-owned Australian defense and technology systems group Tenix could be sold in a A$1 billion-plus ($900 million) auction, the Australian Financial Review reported on Monday. 

 Owners the Salteri family, one of Australia's richest families, have appointed UBS to handle the sale, with a range of interested parties notified of the plans, the paper reported, without citing sources. Britain's BAE Systems ( BAES.L ) and U.S. groups Raytheon ( RTN.N ) and General Dynamics Corp ( GD.N ) are seen as possible bidders, with Australian contractor Leighton Holdings Ltd ( LEI.AX ) also expected to be a keen participant. Other Australian firms United Group Ltd ( UGL.AX ) and Transfield Services Ltd ( TSE.AX ), and private equity firms, are also expected to show interest, the paper reported.
