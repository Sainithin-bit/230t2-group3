 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Geely Holding's discussions to acquire Volvo from Ford Motor Co have stalled over disagreements on intellectual property, a source close to the talks said on Wednesday. 

 Representatives from both Geely, the parent of Hong Kong-listed Geely Automotive, and Ford are meeting in London to discuss Geely's interest in Ford's Swedish unit. The talks are focused on the US carmaker's worries about sharing its proprietary technology and plans for new products, said the source in response to a Reuters query about an earlier Bloomberg report. The companies have been discussing a possible deal for 10 months. A Ford spokesman declined to comment on an earlier Bloomberg report that the acquisition talks were faltering.
