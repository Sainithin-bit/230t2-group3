 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Dealers in over-the-counter derivatives and the OTC derivatives market would be subject to U.S. regulations under a package unveiled by the chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. 

 The package proposes one set of rules for dealers while another set would govern the markets. "Many of these (reforms) will require statutory change, of course," CFTC chairman Gary Gensler said in presenting the package to senators on June 4. Here is a summary of the package: Regulating derivatives dealers --All dealers would be covered, regardless of type of firm, method of trading or the derivative or swap involved. --Congress would require regulators to promulgate "prudent and conservative capital requirements and initial margining requirements." --Business conduct standards would include prohibitions on fraud, manipulation and other abuses, as well as adherence to position limits set by CFTC. --Recordkeeping and reporting would be required for all OTC derivatives positions and transactions. Requirements would include retaining a complete audit trail and mandatory reporting to a regulated trade repository of any trades that are not centrally cleared. --Aggregate information on positions and trades would be available to the public. Regulating derivatives markets --OTC derivatives would be cleared through central clearinghouses whenever possible. Clearinghouses required to set and maintain robust margin standards and other needed risk controls. --OTC derivatives must move onto regulated exchanges or regulated transparent electronic trading systems whenever possible. Timely reporting of trades and prompt dissemination of prices and other trade data to the public required. Regulatory authority --Commodity Exchange Act would be amended to define OTC derivatives and give CFTC authority to regulate them. Care taken to avoid duplication if other regulators are best-suited to handle specific OTC derivatives. --CFTC could impose recordkeeping and reporting requirements; police exchanges and electronic trading systems; recordkeeping, transparency requirements to cover all swaps. --CFTC could impose position limits, including aggregate limits across markets, on OTC derivatives that perform or affect a significant price-discovery function on regulated markets. --Regulators to monitor trades to make sure customized derivatives are not used as a way to avoiding central clearing. --CFTC retail fraud authority over "rolling spot" contracts would expand from foreign exchange to all commodities. --Foreign exchanges must adopt position limits and reporting requirements that match U.S. rules in order to have access to customers in the United States.
