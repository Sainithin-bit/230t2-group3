 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The number of U.S. workers filing new claims for jobless benefits fell for a third straight week last week, government data showed on Thursday, indicating some loss of force in the pace of the labor market's deterioration. 

 KEY POINTS: * Initial claims for state unemployment insurance benefits fell 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 621,000 in the week ended May 30, the Labor Department said. The week covered the Memorial Day holiday, which could have had an impact on the data. * Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast new claims slipping to 620,000 from a previously reported count of 623,000. * The number of people staying on the benefit rolls after collecting an initial week of aid fell 15,000 to 6.74 million in the week ended May 23, the latest week for which the data is available. * This was the first time that so-called continued claims have declined since the week of January 3 and was also the first time in 17 weeks that they did not set a record. That held the insured unemployment rate at 5.0 percent. * However, the four-week moving average for new claims, considered to be a better gauge of underlying trends as it smooths out week-to-week volatility, rose 4,000 to 631,250 in the week ending May 30. PRODUCTIVITY: U.S. non-farm productivity was much stronger than initially estimated in the first quarter, government data showed on Thursday, as the number of hours in manufacturing fell at a record pace. KEY POINTS: * The Labor Department said non-farm productivity rose at a revised 1.6 percent annual rate, the fastest since the third quarter of 2008. This was well above initial estimates of a 0.8 percent increase published last month and the 0.6 percent drop in the fourth quarter. * Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast productivity, which measures the hourly output per worker, increasing at a 1.2 percent rate. * Hours worked plunged at a 9 percent annual rate in the first quarter, the largest decline since the first quarter of 1975. Hours worked in manufacturing tumbled at an annual rate of 19.5 percent, the biggest quarterly drop on records dating back to 1987. * Unit labor costs, a gauge of inflation and profit pressures closely watched by the Federal Reserve, increased 3.0 percent in the first quarter, a touch above Wall Street's estimates for a 2.9 percent advance. COMMENTS: DAVID RESLER, CHIEF ECONOMIST, NOMURA SECURITIES, NEW YORK "We knew last week the likely direction was going to be revised because the top-line of the calculation is closely correlated with the Bureau of Economic Analysis' measure of non-farm output. So when that was 6/10th percent faster growth than previously reported, that was telling us we would probably be seeing an upward revision. "So a miss of a couple tenths is not surprising. The direction was important and it was foretold by the GDP revisions. "We probably saw the peak (in jobless claims) a while back when it was at 675 or 680 or something like that, but we haven't moved very materially lower yet, and that's a concern. "Productivity was in line with expectations and we don't form a forecast of jobless claims for each week. It's a worthless exercise to forecast weekly jobless claims, but it's one of the more important pieces of data we get. You can't forecast what you can't see. To forecast it you have to know information that's actually revealing." BULENT BAYGUN, HEAD OF U.S. INTEREST RATE STRATEGY, BNP PARIBAS, NEW YORK: "If you look at continued claims they were a little better than we had expected, but I wouldn't make too make too much of a fuss about it because if you look at ADP there was no major surprise there either. So any anxiety about the employment report surprising to the high side seems to have been evaded, and I think that is creating the backdrop for somewhat higher yields right now." MICHAEL JAMES, SENIOR TRADER, WEDBUSH MORGAN, LOS ANGELES: "I think the ADP report yesterday was more important than the jobless claims number today. The weekly jobless claims this week will get less attention given the unemployment report tomorrow. The ADP report suggested the unemployment report will be "basically inline tomorrow, so we shouldn't be looking for too much of a surprise tomorrow. I think people are just inclined to take equity exposure down ahead of the jobs report and that's why you saw the market move yesterday." JOHN RYDING, CHIEF ECONOMIST, RDQ ECONOMICS, NEW YORK: "If you ask me what's encouraging from the turning point story in the jobless claims numbers, it's the fact that the unemployment rate on continuing claims has been steady now at 5.0 percent for the last three weeks." "This unemployment rate has been rising steadily, consistently at a tenth of a percent per week so the fact that we've got three weeks with no increase, this is another signal that we are possibly at a cyclical turning point here." KEITH HEMBRE, CHIEF ECONOMIST, FAF ADVISORS, MINNEAPOLIS: JOBLESS CLAIMS: "I would highly doubt the decline in continued claims is a trend. The trend is that it will go higher. This could be an anomaly. "Job weakness is beginning to diminish. Claims at this level is consistent with job losses and upward pressure on the unemployment rate. We have to see initial claims fall to 400,000 on a trend basis before we can look for an improvement in the unemployment rate." "We think the jobless rate would peak at 9.8 percent in early 2010." PRODUCTIVITY: "It's encouraging how well productivity has held up there in the first quarter. Productivity tends to be flat when GDP suffers a serious contraction. It's a sign that firms are very quick to reduce hours worked in response to the decline in demand and output." MICHAEL DARDA, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MKM PARTNERS LLC, GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT: "It's good news with respect to the fact that we're looking like we turned the corner in terms of the claims. They're receding from the highs we saw in April. That's a sign that we're close to the end of the recession, if it holds, and we're also seeing that kind of data in other indicators. I think it's safe to say that the recession will end by the end of the summer. "The data is about what I was expected. Productivity came in a little better than expected and continuing claims fell for first time in a while, so that's good as well. There aren't any big surprises here." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stock indexes rallied. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices declined slightly. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar was flat.
