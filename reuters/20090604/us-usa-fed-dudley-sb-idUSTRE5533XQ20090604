 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The risk of the Federal Reserve suffering losses on its flagship program to lower consumer borrowing costs are "quite remote", the president of the New York Federal Reserve said on Thursday, adding he expected it to be profitable for taxpayers. 

 William Dudley said he has so far been encouraged by the results of the Fed's Term Asset Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) which lends money to investors against asset-backed securities, but cautioned it was "too early to say the program had been a resounding success." The lending facility is a crucial part of efforts by the Fed and the Treasury to lower borrowing costs for consumers for everything from student loans to new cars. Those costs had skyrocketed after credit markets froze last year. Some experts have questioned whether the facility puts the Federal Reserve -- the U.S. central bank -- at risk for losses and whether it is too good a deal for investors. "Does the possibility of attractive returns for TALF investors mean that the Federal Reserve is taking on large credit risks? I think the answer is a clear 'no'," Dudley told a summit hosted by financial industry group SIFMA, adding it was critical for investors to take part in the program for it to be a success. He said a number of layers protect the Fed from losses, including top credit ratings, and that any loss would first be taken by returns the Fed has earned on the TALF and the money provided by the Treasury's bailout fund. "We think it is unlikely that the Treasury will lose money on this program, and it sits ahead of the Fed in terms of its loss exposure. The risk posed to the Federal Reserve therefore seems quite remote," he said, adding that the Fed expects the program to be profitable for taxpayers and succeed in pushing down borrowing costs for households and businesses. After getting off to a slow start in March and April, the program has begun to gain traction and lured some investors and issuers back into the asset-backed securities market. In June, investor demand for loans under the TALF rose to about $11.5 billion, up 8 percent from May and up 145 percent from the first round in March. In total, the Fed has lent about $28.5 billion under the program -- lower than the maximum $200 billion it said it could lend in the initial phase. "We're not back yet to the $200 billion annual rate of issuance before the crisis and we don't expect to get there, but we are making a good start," Dudley said. But, Dudley said, while conditions in capital markets overall have shown signs of improvement, "securitization markets are still significantly impaired." The program will be opened to commercial mortgage backed securities in mid-June, and then older, so-called "legacy" CMBS in July. Dudley said the facility may be opened to residential mortgage-backed securities later in the summer. (Editing by  James Dalgleish )
