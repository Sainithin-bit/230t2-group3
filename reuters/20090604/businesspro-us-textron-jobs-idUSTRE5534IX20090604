 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Textron Inc's ( TXT.N ) Cessna unit plans another round of job cuts in the face of deteriorating demand for corporate aircraft, the diversified U.S. manufacturer said on Thursday. 

 "Continued order cancellations and weakness in general aviation markets are forcing further revisions to its aircraft production outlook, which will result in additional reductions in Cessna's workforce," the world's largest maker of business jets said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. It did not say how many jobs would be cut and a spokesman did not immediately return a call seeking a comment. The recession has posed a double whammy to Providence, Rhode Island-based Textron, which is working to radically downsize its finance business and coping with a simultaneous sharp falloff in demand for aircraft. Business jets have become something of a symbol of corporate excess in the current downturn, after the heads of big Detroit automakers outraged Congress last year by flying to Washington in private planes to ask for government money. Textron said it would update its forecast for corporate jet deliveries next month when it reports second-quarter results. Analysts, on average, expect a break-even second quarter and have forecast an 85 percent drop in per-share profit for the year. Textron in April slashed its profit target for the year by about half. Its shares were up 2 cents at $11.40 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by  Scott Malone , Editing by Maureen Bavdek)
