 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oil prices rose more than 3 percent and Wall Street advanced on Thursday as hopes that the U.S. economy is on the mend returned to the fore on encouraging news about weekly jobless claims and business productivity. 

 The strength in U.S. stocks and signs of an improving economy eroded the safe-haven appeal of U.S. government debt, pushing the price of U.S. Treasuries lower. The euro, meanwhile, rose against the U.S. dollar in volatile trade after the European Central Bank kept a benchmark interest rate unchanged at a record low 1.0 percent. Gold rose as the dollar gave up gains versus the euro and crude climbed above $68 a barrel, stoking fears of inflation. Financial shares led U.S. stocks higher, with the economic data offsetting disappointing May retail sales. The S&P retail index .RLX fell 2.3 percent as 63 percent of retailers posted same-store sales that fell short of Wall Street estimates, according to data compiled by Thomson Reuters. Investors had hoped for signs consumers were spending again. "A little bit of optimism has been built into those (retail) stocks the past two weeks. That sector in particular had moved meaningfully higher," said Kevin Kruszenski, head of listed trading at KeyBanc Capital Markets in Cleveland. At 1 p.m., the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was up 33.76 points, or 0.39 percent, at 8,709.04. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was up 5.55 points, or 0.60 percent, at 937.31. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was up 10.35 points, or 0.57 percent, at 1,836.27. The number of U.S. workers filing new claims for jobless benefits fell for a third straight week, government data showed, indicating a slower deterioration of the job market. European shares closed flat as gains in drugmakers and oil producers were offset by weaker mining stocks and the ECB's decision to keep interest rate unchanged. The pound was lower against the dollar after the Bank of England also left its benchmark rate unchanged. "We may be bouncing about like a cork in the bath for a while. We've made our surge forwards in the last three months in a fairly dramatic fashion," said David Buik, senior partner at BGC Partners in London. "The markets are recovering. (ECB President Jean-Claude) Trichet says an economic recovery is on the way. We'd love to believe him, but we're not sure we do." The FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  of top European companies closed down 0.2 percent at 866.56. The index moved in and out of positive territory throughout the session. The ECB said it expected recession in the euro zone to last another year, and reiterated plans to buy 60 billion euros in covered bonds across the region in both primary and secondary markets. At a news conference after the ECB's policy meeting Trichet said it was important that Washington had expressed support for a strong dollar, which helped mute losses in the greenback. "Trichet's not giving an inch as far as encouraging any loosening expectations," said Boris Schlossberg, director of FX research at GFT Forex in New York. "Some in markets wanted to see a hint of another 25 basis-point cut in the second half. He's admitted they'll have negative growth this year but says it will recover in 2010." The dollar was down against a basket of major currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index .DXY off 0.2 percent at 79.33. The euro was up 0.11 percent at $1.4166, and against the yen, the dollar was up 0.66 percent at 96.55. Oil rallied after Goldman Sachs raised its year-end forecast to $85 a barrel from $65, and introduced a new forecast of $95 for the end of 2010. U.S. crude for July delivery rose $2.74 to $68.86 a barrel. London Brent crude gained $2.88 to $68.76. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was down 29/32 in price to yield 3.65 percent. The 2-year U.S. Treasury note was down 2/32 to yield 0.93 percent. Spot gold prices rose $14.65 to $976.80 an ounce. Asian equities fell overnight from eight-month highs, led by commodity-related shares, as investors followed a downturn in U.S. and European markets the day before. The MSCI index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS slipped 1.9 percent and Japan's Nikkei  .N225  lost 0.75 percent.
