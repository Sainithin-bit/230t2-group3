 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. non-farm productivity was much stronger than initially estimated in the first quarter, government data showed on Thursday, as the number of hours in manufacturing fell at a record pace. 

 The Labor Department said non-farm productivity rose at a revised 1.6 percent annual rate, the fastest since the third quarter of 2008. This was well above initial estimates of a 0.8 percent increase published last month and the 0.6 percent drop in the fourth quarter. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast productivity, which measures the hourly output per worker, increasing at a 1.2 percent rate. Hours worked plunged at a 9 percent annual rate in the first quarter, the largest decline since the first quarter of 1975. Hours worked in manufacturing tumbled at an annual rate of 19.5 percent, the biggest quarterly drop on records dating back to 1987. Unit labor costs, a gauge of inflation and profit pressures closely watched by the Federal Reserve, increased 3.0 percent in the first quarter, a touch above Wall Street's estimates for a 2.9 percent advance.
