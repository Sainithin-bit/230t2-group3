 PHOENIX  (Reuters) - The Arizona Cardinals have signed twice Pro Bowl safety Adrian Wilson on a fresh five-year contract, the team said on Thursday. 

 Wilson, who had been scheduled to start his final season in 2009, can now expect to end his playing days in Arizona. Financial terms of the deal, which runs through the 2013 season, were not disclosed by the team. Wilson, a Pro Bowl selection in 2006 and 2008, is the longest-tenured Cardinal and his re-signing had been a top off-season priority for Arizona. The 29-year-old became the face of the franchise in helping lead the Cardinals to their first Super Bowl appearance in February. "The greatest sacrifice is patience," Wilson told the team's official website (www.azcardinals.com) about his commitment to Arizona. "I think it really defines you. It defines your character. Just being able to stick through something, not always jump ship when things go bad, I think it speaks volumes." A third-round draft choice by the Cardinals in 2001, Wilson has 18 career interceptions and 18-1/2 sacks. (Writing by  Mark Lamport-Stokes  in Los Angeles; Editing by  Justin Palmer )
