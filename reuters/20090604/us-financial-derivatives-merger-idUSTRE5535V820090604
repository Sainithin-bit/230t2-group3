 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - There is no compelling reason to merge the U.S. equities and futures regulators, said the chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Thursday when asked if a merger will be proposed. 

 "I think a merger for merger's sake would not meet that test" of improving the regulatory system, CFTC Chairman Gary Gensler said. He spoke to reporters after presenting at a Senate hearing a proposal for comprehensive oversight of over-the-counter derivatives dealers and markets. Gensler did not respond directly to questions on whether the Obama administration would propose a merger. A combination of CFTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission is a recurrent idea when regulatory reform is under discussion. The chairman of the House Financial Services Committee said on Wednesday that a merger was off the table from his point of view. (Reporting by  Charles Abbott ; Editing by  Andre Grenon )
