 WARSAW  (Reuters) - Global trade may contract by more than 6 percent in 2009 but could return to positive growth next year, World Bank chief economist Justin Lin said on Thursday. 

 "A global trade contraction could be larger than the 6 percent that we had earlier expected," Lin told Reuters in an interview during a visit to Poland. Lin also said recent rises in global stock markets could point to the start of a global economic recovery. (Reporting by Karolina Slowikowska and Marcin Goclowski, writing by Gareth Jones)
