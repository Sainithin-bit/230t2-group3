 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Video game maker Electronic Arts Inc ERTS.O said on Wednesday it agreed with the Federal Trade Commission not to buy rival Take-Two Interactive Software Inc ( TTWO.O ) until regulators end a probe, or 45 days pass, after EA complies with an FTC information request. 

 The FTC is reviewing the roughly $2 billion takeover deal proposed by EA for Take-Two, the publisher of "Grand Theft Auto." Last month, EA extended a tender offer for Take-Two shares until June 16, allowing the FTC probe to continue. Take-Two has rejected EA's offer as too little and had said that it wanted to wait for merger talks until the launch of "Grand Theft Auto 4." GTA made a record-breaking launch at the end of April, and Take-Two on Thursday will report earnings for the April-ending quarter. Take-Two shares rose 1 percent to $27.37, and EA shares were 1.4 percent higher at $49.25 on Nasdaq in late morning trading. (Reporting by  Peter Henderson ; Editing by Maureen Bavdek)
