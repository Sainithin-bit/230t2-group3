 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Faced with energy and metals prices that have risen faster than many executives expected this year, U.S. manufacturers are succeeding in pushing through price increases to their customers, executives said. 

 Following word Monday that United Technologies Corp's ( UTX.N ) Carrier air conditioner unit would be raising its North American prices by about 6 percent, executives at other top diversified manufacturers, including SPX Corp ( SPW.N ) and Honeywell International Inc ( HON.N ) said they are continuing to push through price hikes. In addition to surging oil prices -- U.S. crude futures last month pushed into record territory above $130 a barrel before sliding back to $122.76 on Wednesday -- manufacturers are coping with higher prices for metals including copper, steel and aluminum. "Material inflation is one of the risks that we are managing carefully, but right now we are passing those prices along and customers seem to be begrudgingly accepting them," said Patrick O'Leary, chief financial officer at SPX. He noted that about 60 percent of the company's cost of sales comes from raw materials, particularly copper and electrical-grade steel, which it uses in electrical transformers. Speaking to an investor conference in New York on Wednesday, O'Leary said the company offset rising costs in the first quarter, adding, "I don't expect anything different in Q2." SPX is not alone in its concern about steel prices, said Ann Duignan, an analyst at JPMorgan, which organized the investor conference this week. "Steel remains a pain point for nearly all machinery companies," Duignan wrote in a note to clients. Price hikes are also not limited to the industrial sector. Last week Dow Chemical Co ( DOW.N ), the biggest U.S. chemical manufacturer said it would be raising prices by 20 percent as a result of surging energy costs. 'YOU HAVE TO PUSH PRICE' United Technologies raised prices at Carrier, and has also pushed through price increases at its Otis elevator and other building-related businesses. Commodity costs have risen faster than the company, which also makes helicopters and jet engines, forecast, a top executive said this week. "We have seen obviously cost inflation across the business; we've probably seen about $50 million of commodity headwind this year that we hadn't planned on," Greg Hayes, vice president of accounting and finance, said on Tuesday. "We're pushing price across most of our businesses on the commercial side and it's actually getting traction," Hayes said. "You have to push price when costs go up." Oil prices have run up some 28 percent this year, continuing a five-year run that has seen the cost of crude quadruple. That and a more recent surge in food prices have stoked worries about inflation. Copper futures are up about 17 percent so far this year, with aluminum up about 20 percent. "We have been really dealing with raw material increases over the past couple of years and what we've been doing is using price and productivity to offset those headwinds over the past couple of years and have been actually quite successful," said Murray Grainger, vice president of investor relations at Honeywell, with products including aerospace electronics and systems to control heating, cooling and other systems in large buildings.
