 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEH.N began using its capital to buy back its shares in the wake of its falling stock, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday, citing a person familiar with the matter. 

 It was unclear how much stock Lehman bought, the Journal said. Lehman may also look to sell a stake to a group of investors and has held talks in recent days with at least one foreign entity, the Journal reported, citing a source. Lehman's stock closed Tuesday's session down 9.5 percent, or $3.22, at $30.61 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by  Anupreeta Das , editing by Leslie Gevirtz)
