 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. private-sector employers unexpectedly added 40,000 jobs in May, according to a private report by ADP Employer Services released on Wednesday. 

 In April, the private sector added 13,000 jobs. April's addition was revised up from the previously reported 10,000. Economists' median expectation was for a drop of 30,000 jobs in May, according to a Reuters poll. (Reporting by  Burton Frierson ; Editing by Theodore d'Afflisio)
