 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. service sector grew in May for a second straight month, according to a report released on Wednesday that exceeded Wall Street expectations but showed a worrying surge in inflation pressures. 

 The report supports inflation worries expressed on Tuesday by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and suggests that the U.S. central bank may have to turn its focus to reining in price growth from warding off recession. The Institute for Supply Management said its non-manufacturing index came in at 51.7 in May versus 52.0 in April. That was above the level of 50 that is the dividing line between growth and contraction. "We have been getting stronger than expected data over the past couple of weeks, both from the manufacturing side and now from the services side," said Michael Pond, Treasury and inflation-linked strategist at Barclays Capital in New York. "Data overall has been quite inconsistent with calls back in March that the U.S. was entering a prolonged recession." Economists had expected a reading of 51.0 for May, according to the median of their forecasts in a Reuters poll. The 76 forecasts ranged from 48.5 to 53.0. Stocks were flat on Wall Street and the dollar got a slight lift after the report. U.S. government bonds, which perform better during weak economic times, extended their losses after the ISM report. Underpinning concerns with inflation, the prices paid index rose to 77.0 in May, the second-highest reading in the report's 11-year history. It was up from 72.1 in April and the rise also contributed to bond-market losses. The services sector represents about 80 percent of U.S. economic activity, including businesses such as banks, airlines, hotels and restaurants.
