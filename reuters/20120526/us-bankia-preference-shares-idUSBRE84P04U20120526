 MADRID  (Reuters) - Bankia's chairman Jose Ignacio Goirigoizarri said on Saturday he did not envisage converting about 4 billion euros ($5.00 billion)in preference shares held by investors into capital. 
 "We don't envisage that the solution around preference shares will be to convert them into capital, but when we have a solution, we will communicate it," he told a press conference a day after Bankia asked for a 19 billion euro state bailout, the biggest bank rescue ever in Spain.
