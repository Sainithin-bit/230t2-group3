 (Corrects revenue figure and percentage in paragraph 4) 
   By  Chris Reiter 

 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc. DALRQ.PK posted a narrower first-quarter loss on Monday, a week before the bankrupt carrier is due to exit Chapter 11, boosted by higher fares and lower costs. The No. 3 U.S. airline, which aims to list new shares in early May, reported a loss of $130 million compared with a loss of $2.1 billion in the year-ago quarter. Results in both periods were burdened by restructuring expenses. Excluding costs related to the carrier's reorganization and other special items, Delta said it lost $6 million, compared with a loss of $356 million in the first quarter of 2006. Operating revenue rose 11.4 percent to $4.14 billion, boosted by higher fares and increased capacity. Delta is exiting bankruptcy amid signs of softening demand for domestic U.S. air travel. A slowdown in air travel could threaten the long-suffering industry's nascent recovery. Last week, Continental Airlines Inc. CAL.N warned that it expects yields -- a measure of average ticket prices -- to decline this quarter, while Southwest Airlines Co. ( LUV.N ) said it expected second-quarter unit revenue to be down from the previous year. But Delta, which expects to emerge from bankruptcy with a $10 billion market value -- second among U.S. airlines after Southwest -- said it was not seeing the same trends. "We do seem to be living in a parallel universe," Chief Operating Officer Jim Whitehurst said on a conference call. "We're much more bullish and much more pleased with the advanced bookings than most of our competitors. Whitehurst said domestic bookings for the busy summer travel season were "up solidly" from last year, while demand on international routes was "surging." The company expects an operating profit margin of 11 percent to 13 percent in the second quarter after 3.7 percent in the first. INTERNATIONAL GROWTH Since filing for bankruptcy in September 2005, Delta has lowered labor costs, slashed debt and expanded its international network. Currently, about 30 percent of its fleet is devoted to international routes and the carrier expects to increase that to 40 percent as it adds service to Tel Aviv, Dubai and the Pacific region. Delta also plans to acquire landing and departure slots at London's Heathrow and start serving the busy airport by next spring. Delta said three to six slots, which currently go for about $20 million each, would be optimal. Delta said it lowered operating costs in the first quarter 2.3 percent, or $94 million, despite increasing capacity 2.0 percent. Nonoperating costs were reduced 20.3 percent, or $41 million, as lower debt levels led to lower interest expenses. Delta ended the quarter, which was plagued by severe weather, with $4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Of that amount, $2.9 billion was unrestricted. The carrier said it generated $461 million in free cash flow in the quarter. The carrier, which was driven into Chapter 11 by high costs and low-fare competition, hopes to get court approval to leave bankruptcy at a hearing on Wednesday. The majority of the airline's creditors have voted in favor of Delta's reorganization plan. Once it emerges from bankruptcy, which the company expects will be on April 30, Delta plans to cancel its current shares and issue new shares to its creditors. The new shares will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. (Additional reporting by Kyle Peterson)
