 AMSTERDAM/LONDON  (Reuters) - British bank Barclays has agreed to buy Dutch rival ABN AMRO in a recommended deal worth just over 67 billion euros ($91.2 billion), the two banks said on Monday. 

 The banks said they had agreed to sell ABN's U.S. bank LaSalle to Bank of America for $21 billion. ABN shareholders will receive 3.225 Barclays shares for each share they own. They said the deal values each ABN share at 36.25 euros. Barclays shareholders will own about 52 percent of the enlarged company, to be called Barclays Plc.
