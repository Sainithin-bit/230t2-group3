 LONDON  (Reuters) - Private equity firm Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts KKR.UL and its consortium partner said they have raised their offer for Alliance Boots AB.L to 1,139 pence per share after buying 49.7 million shares at that price. 

 With these shares the team now owns or has undertakings for 21.4 percent of Britain's largest pharmacy chain, it said in a statement released late on Monday.
