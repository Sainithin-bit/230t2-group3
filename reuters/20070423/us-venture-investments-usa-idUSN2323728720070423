 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - U.S. venture capital financing rose 8 percent to $7 billion during the first quarter, amid record funding for health care companies, a survey to be published on Monday shows. 

 But two-thirds of traditional venture capital (VC) categories saw reduced investment, year-over-year, according to the Dow Jones VentureOne and Ernst & Young report, reflecting a weak market for initial offerings, the classic VC exit route. Success for start-ups in many areas is being redefined as merging into bigger industry players, generating returns of tens or hundreds of million dollars for investors, rather than the potential billions from increasingly rare hit IPOs. Ten out of 15 categories saw reduced funding, some sharply, between the first quarter of 2006 and 2007 including consumer, information technology and even some health-care segments. VCs signed 584 deals in the quarter, down 31 from a year earlier. "There is a general bullish sentiment in venture-capital and no shortage of access to capital for top-tier venture investors," said Joseph Muscat, who runs Ernst & Young's venture capital practice in the Americas. But he added: "I do think you are seeing certain sub-sectors reaching maturation" in relative attractiveness versus other fast-growing sectors. The $2.88 billion invested in health care companies in the first quarter was the highest on record, tied to a healthy market for both IPOs and merger and acquisition activity that is less evident in weaker sectors of the market. Biopharmaceuticals accounted for much of the first-quarter increase, growing to nearly $1.8 billion from $861 million in the same period of 2006. A major focus was on cancer, heart disease and other internal medicines aimed at staving off the inevitable for aging baby-boomers, according to VentureOne. The category saw 10 big deals, including the largest: a $175 million second round led by private equity firm 3i Group for EUSA Pharma of King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, a developer of specialty drugs for the European market. Funding for medical devices and equipment rose 55 percent to $953 million. But strength in pharmaceuticals and devices concealed weakness in other segments: health-care services fell more than 50 percent to $84.2 million, for example. The $2.88 billion invested in health was up 65 percent on the year and went into 167 deals, 15 more than a year ago, amid a flow to early stage pharmaceutical and medical device companies. Venture investment in information technology companies fell 16 percent to $3.12 billion in the first quarter. Four out of five sectors declined -- communications and networks, electronics and computers, semiconductors and software. Only information services saw increased investment, rising 10 percent to $722 million in 91 deals, the survey showed. This category captures the boom in funding for next-generation Internet start-ups, popularly known as "Web 2.0." Muscat said further growth in Web 2.0 investment will hinge on whether an anticipated wave of merger activity takes place later this year for hot Internet start-ups. "The bullish activity will begin to be challenged if we don't see some of those exits happen," he said, referring to how VCs cash out. Funding business, consumer and retail services continued a two-year slide, dropping 34 percent to $505 million during the latest quarter from $771 million in the first quarter of 2006. Smaller bright spots were in the alternative energy and environmental technology sectors. Alternative energy attracted $237.0 million in 10 deals in the first quarter, compared to $53.8 million and six deals in the first quarter of 2006. There was $54.1 million invested in eight environmental companies in first quarter 2007, up from $4 million in one deal a year ago. California companies attracted 48 percent of U.S. venture funding during the first quarter, VentureOne data showed.
