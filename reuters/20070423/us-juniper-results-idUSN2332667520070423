 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Network equipment maker Juniper Networks Inc. JNPR.O posted on Monday an anticipated fall in quarterly profit, and its shares fell as it gave a slightly weaker-than-expected 2007 outlook. 

 Juniper shares fell 4.5 percent in after-hours trade, more than giving back gains posted in the regular session after the company's full-year earnings target came in just short of analysts' consensus estimate. First-quarter net income fell 12 percent to $66.6 million, or 11 cents a share, from $75.8 million, or 13 cents a share, a year earlier, as the company booked charges related to a stock options investigation. Excluding one-time items, earnings were $112.4 million, or 19 cents per share. Revenue rose 11 percent to $626.9 million. Juniper matched analysts' average call for earnings, excluding costs related to a stock option investigation and other items, of 19 cents per share, while revenue came in ahead of its consensus target of $620.9 million, according to Reuters Estimates. Chairman and Chief Executive Scott Kriens said margins declined to 67 from 68.5 last quarter, due to product mix and other factors. During a conference call with analysts, executives said the company's margins should be roughly in that range going forward. For the current second quarter, the company forecast revenue of $640 million to $650 million and earnings, excluding items, of 20 cents per share. Analysts' consensus estimates called for second-quarter revenue of $646.9 million and earnings of 20 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Juniper reiterated its full-year outlook calling for revenue of $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion and earnings before items of 80 cents to 81 cents per share. The company's revenue outlook was in step with analysts' consensus target, but its earnings forecast fell short of Wall Street's call for 2007 earnings of 82 cents. Juniper makes telecommunications equipment as well as digital networks for businesses. Its chief competitor is much larger rival Cisco Systems Inc. ( CSCO.O ) Juniper shares fell to $20.15 after-hours electronic trading. The shares had closed up 2.9 percent at $21.11 after analysts at UBS raised the company's rating to a "buy" and said the company may see higher growth as compared with previous estimates due to a replenished edge portfolio and potentially a new core router by the end of 2007 or early 2008.
