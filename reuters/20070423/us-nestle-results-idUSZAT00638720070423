 ZURICH  (Reuters) - Nestle, the world's largest food company, beat forecasts with a 7.4 percent rise in organic, or underlying, first quarter sales on Monday as demand surged ahead of expected price increases. 

 The Swiss group posted an overall 6.4 percent increase in January-March sales to 24.25 billion Swiss francs ($20.1 billion), as demand rose, especially in emerging markets and in Nestle's pharmaceutical division. "This is an excellent set of results, with good growth across the board," said Morgan Stanley analyst Michael Steib. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Peter Brabeck said the group's pricing power would allow it to meet its targets despite high input prices. The company said further price adjustments were to come, which could then dampen demand. "Input costs remain high, but our strong brands enable us to continue to adjust prices. We therefore expect the group to reach its objective," he said in a statement. The maker of KitKat chocolate wafers and bottler of Perrier water repeated its previously stated outlook, saying it expected to improve its earnings before interest, tax, and amortization margin at constant currencies this year and reach organic growth of 5 to 6 percent. Organic growth measures volume and price changes but strips out currency effects and divestments and acquisitions. Currency movements cut net sales by 1.5 percent, the company said. "A strong set of numbers across the board although the company cautions there could be some stocking by the trade," said Jon Cox, analysts at Kepler Equities. "The food and beverage business is probably growing faster than many anticipate underpinned by its strong innovation in the  health, nutrition and wellness categories, the fastest growing segment of the market. I would expect the stock to react favorably," he added. Nestle shares opened 1.7 percent higher at 490 Swiss francs. Analysts said the good set of figures were tempered somewhat as Nestle warned of input cost increases from higher priced milk, coffee and cocoa and cautioned that further price rises to come could likely dampen demand. The strong pace of growth in emerging markets at 10.3 percent and in the group's pharmaceutical division -- which contains eye-care company Alcon -- at 12.1 percent helped compensate for sluggish growth in Europe at 1.9 percent. Growth in the Americas was 7.2 percent. Nestle has been able in recent quarters to fend off volatility in currencies and commodities to post hefty increases in profit, sales and organic growth. FOCUS ON NUTRITION The company has put its nutrition division -- which produces medical, diet and baby foods -- at the centre of its growth plans, building it up with a string of acquisitions. The group is poised to pay $8 billion for the Gerber babyfood and medical foods units of Novartis, $600 million for U.S. diet-food firm Jenny Craig, and separately, $669 million for Australia's Uncle Tobys snacks and soups. But high prices for coffee and cocoa and volatile sugar prices have challenged food producers like Nestle to reach their objectives. Although sugar prices have fallen to 21-month lows in April, London cocoa futures remained just below four-year highs, bolstered by strong demand and tight supplies, while robusta coffee futures prices have held steady but remain well-supported. According to a poll of 15 analysts conducted by Reuters, Nestle was expected to post a 5 percent increase in sales to 23.97 billion francs and organic sales growth of 5.6 percent for the period. French food rival Danone reports first-quarter figures on Tuesday April 24, and Anglo-Dutch company Unilever Plc/NV on May 3. Nestle shares have outperformed the DJ Stoxx European food and beverage index over the last 12 months, rising 25 percent compared with 19.6 percent for the sector. The shares trade on 18 times forecast 2007 earnings, below Danone at 22 times due to the French group's faster growth, but in line with Unilever at 18 and the sector average of 18.
