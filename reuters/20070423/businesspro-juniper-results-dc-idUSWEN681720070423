 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Network equipment maker Juniper 
Networks Inc. JNPR.O reported a decline in quarterly profit 
on Monday as expenses rose despite higher sales to 
telecommunications companies. 

  First-quarter net income fell to $66.6 million, or 11 cents 
a share, from $75.8 million, or 13 cents a share, a year 
earlier.  Excluding one-time items, earnings were $112.4 million, or 
19 cents per share.  Revenue rose 11 percent to $626.9 million.  Juniper makes telecommunications equipment as well as 
digital networks for businesses. Its chief competitor is Cisco 
Systems Inc. ( CSCO.O ).
