 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Boston Scientific Corp. ( BSX.N ) reported lower net earnings on Monday due to costs related to the acquisition of Guidant Corp. and weaker sales of its drug-coated stents to treat clogged heart arteries. 

 The medical device maker has been stung by a slowdown in demand for both drug-coated stents and implantable heart defibrillators since paying $27 billion for Guidant one year ago. Boston Scientific said sales of drug-coated stents in the quarter were weaker than it expected as physicians referred fewer patients for the procedure after a widely publicized study found stents offered no advantage over medication in preventing heart attacks and death for some patients. Sales of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), however, exceeded the company's expectations. The results were "pretty much in line with relatively modest expectations," said Leerink Swann analyst Jason Wittes. "Stents were so-so. They continue to slide in line with what we would expect, given the J&J numbers." Boston Scientific competes in the stent market against Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ.N ), which last week reported a 27 percent drop in sales of its Cypher drug-coated stent. Boston Scientific reported first-quarter net earnings of $120 million, or 8 cents per share, compared with $332 million, or 40 cents per share, a year ago. The company said it had 1.5 billion shares outstanding, compared with 830 million before the Guidant deal. Adjusted earnings were 20 cents per share, excluding special charges and amortization related to the Guidant acquisition and stock compensation expenses. On that basis, Wall Street was expecting a profit of 19 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Net sales were $2.09 billion, up from $1.62 billion the year before. Sales in the most recent quarter included the company's cardiac rhythm management and cardiac surgery businesses, which were acquired from Guidant in April 2006. CRM sales were $539 million, including $398 million of ICD sales. CRM sales increased from the fourth quarter, when they were $489 million, which included ICD sales of $356 million. The defibrillator market has been hurt by recalls of Guidant products in 2005 and 2006, but there are recent signs that the market is stabilizing. Last week, rival ICD maker St. Jude Medical Inc. ( STJ.N ) also reported higher ICD sales. Boston Scientific said it expects both the defibrillator and stent markets to improve over time. "Sequential sales growth over the past two quarters confirms our belief that the CRM market should start to recover," Boston Scientific Chief Executive Jim Tobin said on a conference call with analysts. Drug-coated stents now account for 69.5 percent of all stenting procedures, the company said. That's down from a peak of almost 90 percent a year ago, before studies revealed the devices can cause blood clots to form long after implantation, prompting doctors to switch back to bare-metal models. Boston Scientific, however, said it gained market share in drug-eluting stents in the first quarter and now holds 55 percent of the market, its strongest position in over a year. Worldwide sales of its Taxus drug-eluting stent were $468 million, down from $633 million a year ago. U.S. Taxus sales were $293 million, down from $419 million a year ago. Boston Scientific forecast second-quarter adjusted earnings excluding charges and other expenses of 15 cents to 20 cents a share on projected net sales of $2.0 billion to $2.1 billion. Analysts on average forecast second-quarter earnings of 22 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates.
