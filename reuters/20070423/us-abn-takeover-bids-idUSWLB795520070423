 AMSTERDAM/LONDON  (Reuters) - ABN AMRO AAH.AS, which agreed on Monday to be acquired by British bank Barclays ( BARC.L ), said it would hear other bids for the bank, but said the Barclays deal was the best option for shareholders. 

 Barclays agreed to buy ABN in a deal worth just over 67 billion euros ($91.2 billion), the biggest-ever bank takeover. Rijkman Groenink, ABN's top executive, said the board would hear other offers in line with its fiduciary duties, but said a merger with Barclays was the "best option" for shareholders. The Royal Bank of Scotland Plc ( RBS.L ), Belgian-Dutch group Fortis FOR.AS and Spain's Santander ( SAN.MC ) have been preparing a counter takeover proposal for ABN and had been scheduled to meet with ABN's top management on Monday. Groenink said he still planned to meet with the three banks. ABN will hold an extraordinary shareholders' meeting to approve the deal with Barclays, which is expected to close during the fourth quarter.
