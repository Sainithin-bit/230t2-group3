 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - If Bank of America pulls off a deal to buy Chicago-based retail bank LaSalle, it will fill in one of the last remaining gaps in nationwide coverage for the second-largest U.S. bank. 

 Plans to sell LaSalle to Bank of America ( BAC.N ) will be announced as early as Monday as part of a wider deal which would see Barclays Plc ( BARC.L ) take over Dutch bank ABN AMRO AAH.AS, sources familiar with the situation said. ABN AMRO's LaSalle, which analysts have said could be worth between $18 billion and $23 billion, has long been viewed as a target for Bank of America, which has a relatively small market share in the Chicago area. The Wall Street Journal said on Sunday that Bank of America would pay around $21 billion for LaSalle. "Bank of America CEO Ken Lewis has specifically mentioned LaSalle as one of the two banks he is interested in acquiring," wrote analysts from Keefe, Bruyette & Woods (KBW) in a recent note. Bank of America was not available for comment. LaSalle could boost Bank of America's share of the market around Chicago from about 2 percent to over 16 percent, the analysts wrote. KBW said in the note it believes LaSalle will earn $1.38 billion in 2007 and would be worth between $18 billion and $23 billion, or between 14 times and 17 times 2007 earnings per share. "Bank of America has said it wants to be a big player in Chicago and that its current efforts have been hampered by a lack of 'density' in the market," wrote the analysts. "An acquisition of LaSalle would meet this need, in our view." SCOTTISH RIVALS? Bank of America, though, could yet face stiff competition for LaSalle. Barclays' expected deal for ABN comes as Edinburgh-based Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ) moves to simplify a possible counter offer for the Dutch bank. RBS, Europe's second-biggest bank, is considering making a solo bid for ABN, although its current consortium partners would still help finance a deal by buying many of ABN's assets, sources said. A consortium of RBS, Spain's Santander ( SAN.MC ) and Belgian-Dutch group Fortis FOR.BR have said they are considering making an approach for ABN. The three banks are due to meet ABN's management in Amsterdam on Monday. Sources have told Reuters that under that consortium's plan, RBS would take over LaSalle and most of ABN's wholesale and Asian business, Santander would take the Brazilian and Italian business and Fortis would take the Benelux retail bank. The scene is set for what could become a major takeover tussle for ABN AMRO and its global assets. Barclays has been in exclusive talks to buy ABN for more than a month. A deal could be the biggest-ever bank takeover. ABN was valued at more than 68 billion euros ($92.5 billion) at Friday's close. For the eventual winners, the prizes are huge. If it won LaSalle, Bank of America "could quickly go from an also-ran to a major competitor in Chicago," wrote the KBW analysts.
