 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Britain's AstraZeneca Plc ( AZN.L ) is near a deal to buy U.S. biotechnology company MedImmune Inc. MEDI.O in a transaction that could be worth more than $13 billion, the Wall Street Journal reported on its Web site on Sunday. 

 The deal could be announced on Monday morning, the paper reported, citing unidentified sources. MedImmune said earlier this month that it had hired Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) to explore a sale. The group said it decided to seek bids following indications of interest by big drugmakers and dissatisfaction over the stock price performance among some investors. It has been the subject of takeover speculation for some time, with talk of a bid intensifying since billionaire investor Carl Icahn disclosed in February he owned 2.8 million shares of the company. AstraZeneca, which is hungry for assets to refill a depleted new drugs pipeline, was considered a possible suitor at the time. MedImmune, one of the larger independent biotech firms in the United States, is best known as the maker of the nasal spray flu vaccine FluMist, but it also has two other marketed products, Synagis for infectious respiratory disease and Ethyol for reducing chemotherapy side effects. MedImmune and AstraZeneca could not immediately be reached for comment.
