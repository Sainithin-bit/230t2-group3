 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - The Chicago Board Options Exchange, the largest U.S. options exchange, said on Monday first-quarter profit after taxes more than tripled on increased trading volume. 

 Net income after taxes rose to $17.6 million from $5 million a year ago. First-quarter revenues grew 31 percent to $77.8 million from $59.2 million a year ago. The CBOE, which is restructuring into a for-profit entity, said volume grew during the quarter, fueled by stock market volatility, which produced significant gains in index and exchange-traded fund option products. "CBOE's volume growth, driven by new products, continues to outpace the options industry overall," said CBOE Chairman and CEO William Brodsky in a statement. CBOE's average daily volume for the first quarter stood at 3.4 million contracts, up from 2.5 million contracts traded in the same year-ago period. "In addition to increased volume, the benefits of CBOE's recent transition to a for-profit business model are also reflected in the bottom line," Brodsky added. The boost in revenues came from a $17.5 million gain in transaction fees, the exchange said. Retained earnings at the end of the quarter totaled $179.4 million, compared with $162 million at the start of the year. Before taxes, earnings for the quarter jumped to $30.3 million from $8.3 million a year earlier. CBOE noted $47.6 million in expenses, down 6 percent from $50.8 million a year ago. Employee costs fell overall because of decreased staffing levels this year compared with last year's level.
