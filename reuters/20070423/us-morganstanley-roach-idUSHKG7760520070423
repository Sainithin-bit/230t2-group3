 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) on Monday named Stephen Roach, its high-profile chief economist known for his pessimism on the U.S. economy and early foretelling of China's rise, as its Asia chairman. 

 The 61-year-old Roach, who has been a frequent visitor to Asia since joining the Wall Street firm in 1982, will take up his new position in June, and will move to Hong Kong in September. "My role is really getting involved with all of our senior relationships, whether they are with investors, corporates, governments. If it involves a banking transaction, I expect certainly to play a role in it," he said in a telephone interview from New York. Morgan Stanley ranks fourth this year for investment banking revenue in Asia Pacific excluding Japan, according to Dealogic, an improvement on its No. 10 ranking for 2006, when it did not have a lead role in IPOs by Industrial and Commercial Bank of China ( 1398.HK ) and Bank of China ( 3988.HK ), the year's largest. Swiss rival UBS ( UBSN.VX ) was the regional revenue leader for both periods, while arch Wall Street foe Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) ranked second last year and is fifth thus far this year. Roach said it was too early to know whether he would look to implement any significant changes. "The region is growing so rapidly that what we need to do is to figure out what is the most efficient way to develop a footprint that makes good commercial sense without sort of mismanaging the cost by which we commit ourselves," he said. Early this year Morgan Stanley agreed to spend $425 million to split from its Indian joint venture partner and go it alone in the country's fast-growing investment banking market. "It's a big region. It's going to be sort of important for me to prioritize where I have to spend my time," Roach said. Earlier this month, Morgan Stanley Chief Executive John Mack told Reuters that the bank was eager to secure its own brokerage license in China, where it has a long-standing joint venture stake in China International Capital Corp. (CICC). Roach, who replaces the recently retired Alasdair Morrison as the bank's Asia chairman, said he will no longer publish research in his new position, but will still express his opinions. "If you do economics it sort of runs through your veins, and that stuff is still there. I will have things to say and views to express, and they will be expressed with far less frequency, but in ways that will be conveyed directly to our clients," he said. Roach said he will not varnish his views for his new post. "People value me in my role for just being pretty straightforward, calling it as I see it, and I'm not going to really alter my view to make it look like pablum for business. It is important to me to maintain a credible, strong voice." "CHINA AT A FASCINATING JUNCTURE" China's economy, which grew at 11.1 percent in the first quarter on an annual basis, is at a "fascinating juncture," Roach said. "The investment and export-led growth dynamic has just got to morph into a broader, more balanced growth story for China involving the Chinese consumer," he said. "The government is very focused. I'm encouraged that that's going to happen. It may not happen with quite the speed that people on the outside want it to, but I think China will get there," said Roach, who visited China six times last year. Roach, who last week warned that the worst is yet to come for the U.S. housing market, predicted during the depths of the Asian financial crisis 10 years ago that China would emerge unscathed, with the potential to become the new regional leader. "It was widely scoffed at, and I think history's borne this one out pretty darn well," he said.
