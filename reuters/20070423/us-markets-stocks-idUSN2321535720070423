 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Monday after oil prices rose and a General Motors executive said the crisis in U.S. mortgage lending hurt U.S. auto sales this month, stirring concerns of an even wider economic impact. 

 Earlier, the Dow industrials hit an intraday record high of 12,983.92, but failed to breach the milestone of 13,000 as sentiment turned on rising fears of the impact of the housing market problems. Also on Monday, ratings agency Moody's Investors Service said that losses from risky subprime loans may go beyond original forecasts. "The question is, Will the subprime market mess have an effect on consumer spending?" said Michael James, senior trader at Wedbush Morgan in Los Angeles. "And oil is going through the $65 level -- that's going to potentially cause increasing uneasiness in the next few days." He said concerns about the wider impact of problems in the subprime mortgage market that serves the riskiest borrowers helped to push down retail stocks, such as Wal-Mart ( WMT.N ), which was one of the biggest drags on the Dow. Shares of Dow component General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) fell 3.19 percent to $30.67 and were the biggest drag on the Dow, after Vice Chairman Bob Lutz said the crisis in the U.S. mortgage market has hurt U.S. auto sales this month, citing "reduced affordability."
