 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp.'s ( BAC.N ) agreement to buy ABN AMRO Holding NV's AAH.AS LaSalle Bank Corp. unit for $21 billion is a pricey bet that it can energize a franchise operating in Chicago, one of the hottest U.S. banking markets, and in Michigan, one of the weakest. 

 The all-cash purchase would fill a hole in Bank of America's 5,737-branch network -- by far the nation's largest -- and make it Chicago's largest bank. It would also give Bank of America its first branches in Michigan, a state ravaged by contraction of a once-dominant auto industry. "It's a full price," said Chris Hagedorn, who helps invest more than $20 billion at Fifth Third Asset Management in Cincinnati. "It's hard to say they (Bank of America) really wanted to be in Michigan on their own. The key take-away is the desire to be in Chicago in a bigger way." LaSalle has 411 branches, 1,500 automated teller machines, 1.4 million retail and 17,000 commercial customers, and $113 billion of assets. Its branch network includes 141 in the Chicago area, 264 in Michigan and six in Indiana. The purchase was announced as ABN AMRO, a Dutch bank, agreed to be acquired by Britain's Barclays Plc ( BARC.L ) for 67 billion euros ($91 billion). Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis has long eyed expansion in Chicago, where Bank of America has 56 branches. "The opportunity arose, and we have acted," Lewis said on a conference call. He said the bank plans no more acquisitions "of any size whatsoever through 2008." Bank of America said its net cost for LaSalle would be $16 billion, after a return of excess capital. It estimated the price at 21.3 times expected 2007 earnings, above a 16.3 multiple on comparable acquisitions, and 2.2 times book value. The bank expects LaSalle to result in $800 million of restructuring costs, $800 million of savings by 2009, and the addition of 2 percent to earnings per share in the first year. "We like this deal, particularly as it strengthens Bank of America in Chicago," wrote Gary Townsend, a Friedman Billings Ramsey & Co. analyst. "(It) will reduce 2007 earnings per share as the company slows share repurchases to build capital." Investors pushed Bank of America shares down 53 cents to $50.51 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. CHICAGO, MICHIGAN Lewis said Chicago's "size of population, attractive demographics, projected growth and overall wealth concentration" was appealing. He added that in retail banking, LaSalle "has materially underpenetrated Chicago, and to a lesser extent Detroit." Bank of America will drop the 67-year-old LaSalle name. LaSalle's roots date to 1927. As of June 30, 2006, JPMorgan Chase & Co. ( JPM.N ) had 15.3 percent of deposits in the Chicago area, LaSalle had 14.11 percent and Bank of America had 1.81 percent, according to Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. data. Lewis said his Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank was confident it would not breach a federal regulatory cap that bars acquisitions giving it more than 10 percent of U.S. deposits. Bank of America recently controlled 9.1 percent. Chicago has experienced a surge in branches, prompting Washington Mutual Inc. ( WM.N ), the largest U.S. thrift, to shut some of its own. Michigan isn't considered as attractive. Last month, Comerica Inc. ( CMA.N ), the state's other main bank, said it will move its headquarters to Dallas from Detroit to be closer to its faster-growing southern markets. DOUBLING DOWN Lewis has agreed to spend more than $100 billion on acquisitions since becoming chief executive in 2001. Bank of America paid more than $82 billion for FleetBoston Financial Corp. in 2004 and credit card issuer MBNA Corp. in 2006. It is also buying Charles Schwab Corp.'s SCHW.O U.S. Trust Corp. unit and a stake in student lender SLM Corp. SLM.N, or Sallie Mae. Lewis has been praised for integrating Fleet and MBNA and surpassing his cost-cutting goals, but he has a reputation for paying big prices for acquisitions. Analysts say that's one reason Bank of America shares trade at just 10.5 times expected 2007 earnings, the lowest multiple of any major U.S. bank, and 1.7 times book value. Still, referring to LaSalle, Lewis said "having a dominant position in some of the best markets in the best economy in the world is not a bad double-down." Bank of America expects a late 2007 or early 2008 closing. ABN AMRO could accept a higher offer for LaSalle for two weeks, and Bank of America could match any higher offer.
