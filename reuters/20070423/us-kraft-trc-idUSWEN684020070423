 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Kraft Foods Inc. KFT.N said on Monday Canadian investment firm TRC Capital Corp. had offered to buy up to 3 million shares of its common stock, or less than 0.2 percent of the food company's shares outstanding. 

 Kraft, the maker of Oreo cookies and Oscar Mayer luncheon meats, said it does not endorse the unsolicited "mini-tender" offer and recommends shareholders do not tender their shares. TRC is offering $31 a share. Kraft's stock closed 12 cents higher at $33.21 on Monday on the New York Stock Exchange.
