 (Reuters) - Diversified manufacturer Crane Co. ( CR.N ) said quarterly profit rose due to improvement across all its segments, except the aerospace and electronics division. 

 The company said the largest increases in operating profit came from its fluid handling and merchandising systems businesses. Crane, which makes electronics, control systems and fluid-handling devices, said its five acquisitions in 2006 also contributed significantly to its profit improvement. Net profit rose to 43.6 million, or 71 cents a share, from $37.4 million, or 61 cents per share, a year earlier, the company said in a statement. First-quarter sales increased 14 percent to $628.2 million. Analysts on average were expecting earnings of 64 cents a share, before exceptional items, on revenue of $626.4 million, according to Reuters Estimates. For the second quarter, the company expects to earn 74 cents to 82 cents a share. Analysts on average expect second-quarter earnings of 73 cents a share, excluding exceptional items. For 2007, Crane now expects earnings toward the higher end of its previously estimated range of $2.80 to $2.95 a share. Analysts on average expect earnings of $2.85 a share, excluding exceptional items, for 2007. (Reporting by Shikhar Balwani, Jennifer Robin Raj in Bangalore)
