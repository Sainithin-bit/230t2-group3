 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve has the authority to curb new subprime lending and should use that power to stamp out abusive practices, a group of U.S. senators wrote in a letter on Monday. 

 "We are concerned that the Federal Reserve Board has not exercised its obligations under the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act (HOEPA) of 1994 to issue regulations that address the problems of predatory lending," reads the letter signed by 10 Democrats on the U.S. Senate Banking Committee. The statute directs the Fed to "prohibit acts or practices in connection with mortgage loans" that it deems to be unfair or abusive. An increasing share of mortgage financing in recent years has come from Wall Street and other investors who do not answer to federal banking regulators. Enforcing HOEPA is one way that the Fed could directly and immediately halt the worst of subprime loans, the letter states. "Action by the board pursuant to this statue is crucial because such a regulation would apply to both bank and non-bank lenders," they said. The letter also called for mortgage originators to stop lending money to borrowers who would need half of their income to make payments, halt writing loans without strong proof of income and force lenders to add the costs of taxes and insurance when offering a loan. A Fed spokeswoman said "We are reviewing these issues as the (Federal Reserve) chairman (Ben Bernanke) said last month." In remarks to Congress' Joint Economic Committee at the end of March, Bernanke said "by setting rules under the HOEPA unfair, deceptive acts and practices provision, the Federal Reserve could set rules for all mortgage lenders." The Fed might run into enforcement issues regarding HOEPA and would not want to take steps that could unduly harm good lending, he said The letter was signed by Sen. Chris Dodd of Connecticut, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, and nine other Democratic members of the committee.
