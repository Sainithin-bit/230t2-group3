 (Reuters) - Barclays Plc has agreed to buy Dutch rival ABN AMRO in a deal worth about 67 billion euros ($91 billion) to create the world's fifth largest bank. 

 The following are key details from the proposed deal, announced in a joint statement on Monday: PRICE ** ABN shareholders would receive 3.225 new ordinary Barclays shares for each ABN share. Including a declared dividend, that values each ABN share at 36.25 euros. ** Under the terms of the offer, Barclays shareholders will own 52 percent of the group, ABN shareholders 48 percent. ** The two parties agreed a break fee of 200 million euros "if the merger protocol is terminated as a result of material breach or withdrawal of recommendation". MANAGEMENT ** Barclays Chief Executive John Varley and President Bob Diamond will keep their current positions at the helm of the merged group. The chairman of ABN's supervisory board, Arthur Martinez, is to become chairman, to be replaced at his retirement by Marcus Agius, Barclays' current chairman. ** The combined bank would be split into Global Retail and Commercial Banking (GRCB), led by Frits Seegers, who currently heads that business at Barclays, and Investment Banking and Investment Management (IBIM), led by Diamond. GRCB will be based in Amsterdam, IBIM will remain in London. ** Barclays Chief Financial Officer Chris Lucas will hold the same position in the merged group. ** Rijkman Groenink, chairman of ABN's managing board, will become a non-executive director. BUSINESSES ** Bank of America to buy ABN's U.S. bank LaSalle for $21 billion. Deal is conditional on offer going through and would help fund a 12 billion euro share buyback. ** The deal includes a "shop around" clause, allowing ABN 14 days from April 22 to look for higher offers, though BoA would be allowed to match any higher bid. The deal also provides for a $200 million termination fee for BoA. COST CUTS AND SYNERGIES ** ABN and Barclays see annual pre-tax synergies of 3.5 billion euros by 2010, 80 percent of that from cost cuts. ** The total pre-tax integration cost of realizing the benefits is expected to be 3.6 billion euros, of which some 2.16 billion will be incurred in 2008. ** The deal would mean total job cuts of 23,600, out of a total workforce of approximately 217,000. Some 10,800 of those positions will be moved offshore. REGULATION ** Britain's Financial Services Authority will be the lead supervisor for the combined group. ** Shares will be listed in London and Barclays will apply for a secondary listing in Amsterdam. ** Combined group head office to be in Amsterdam. TIMING ** An offer document is expected to be published in July, with shareholder meetings to vote on the deal in August. ** The offer is due to be completed in the fourth quarter. ADVISORS ** Barclays Capital, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan Cazenove and Lazard are acting as advisors for Barclays. ** ABN AMRO, Lehman Brothers, Morgan Stanley, Rothschild and UBS are acting as financial advisors to ABN. Goldman Sachs is acting as exclusive advisor to ABN's supervisory board.
