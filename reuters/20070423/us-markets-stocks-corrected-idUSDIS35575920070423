 (Corrects to 13,000 from 13.000 in headline) 

 By Jennifer Coogan NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Stocks were little changed on Monday, leaving the Dow just shy of 13,000, after a brokerage cut its rating on drug company Pfizer Inc. ( PFE.N ) and offset stronger-than-expected earnings news. Hasbro Inc. HAS.N, the No. 2 U.S. toymaker, handily beat Wall Street profit expectations, sending its stock up 8.3 percent to $32.20 on the NYSE.  "When we went through 10,000, 11,000, 12,000, it took about four or five shots before we went through." said Victor Pugliese, director of listed equity trading at First Albany Corp. in San Francisco. "All you need is for a couple of the bigger stocks to have real good earnings, but those aren't coming until Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday." The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was up 10.73 points, or 0.08 percent, at 12,972.71. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was up 2.15 points, or 0.14 percent, at 1,486.50. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was up 2.06 points, or 0.08 percent, at 2,528.45. Prudential cut shares of Pfizer and Deutsche Bank downgraded oil company Exxon Mobil ( XOM.N ) -- both Dow industrials components. Pfizer shares fell 1.5 percent to $26.58 and Exxon shares were little changed at $79.73 despite a 60-cent gain in crude oil futures. Biotechnology was a top-performing sector after Anglo-Swedish drug maker AstraZeneca ( AZN.L ) agreed to buy U.S. biotech company MedImmune Inc. MEDI.O for more than $15 billion.  MedImmune stock shot up 17.9 percent to $56.60 on the Nasdaq. In other M&A news, Bank of America ( BAC.N ) agreed to buy ABN Amro's Chicago-based U.S. bank, LaSalle Bank Corp. The deal is contingent upon British bank Barclays' ( BARC.L ) buying its Dutch rival ABN AMRO.  Bank of America fell 0.6 percent to $50.76. Large brokerages rose after Merrill Lynch boosted its rating on Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ), Goldman Sachs Group Inc. ( GS.N ), Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. LEH.N and Bear Stearns Cos. Inc. BSC.N  Shares of Lehman were up 0.4 percent to $78.41, Goldman stock gained 1 percent to $222.22 and Bear Stearns added 1.2 percent to $158.41. Morgan Stanley stock was up 1 percent to $83.77. Among the companies reporting earnings after the close of trading on Monday are chip maker Texas Instruments Inc. TXN.N and biotechnology firm Amgen Inc. ( AMGN.O )
