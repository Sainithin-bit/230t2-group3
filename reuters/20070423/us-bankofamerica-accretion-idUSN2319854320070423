 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp. ( BAC.N ) on Monday said it expects its $21 billion purchase of ABN Amro Holding NV's AAH.AS LaSalle Bank Corp. unit to add 2 percent to earnings per share in the first year and 5 percent once cost savings are phased in. 

 Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America expects $800 million of after-tax cost savings from the purchase, with half in 2008 and half in 2009. It also expects $800 million of after-tax restructuring costs. ABN Amro has agreed to be acquired by British bank Barclays Plc ( BARC.L ) for about 67 billion euros ($91 billion), or 36.25 euros per share.
