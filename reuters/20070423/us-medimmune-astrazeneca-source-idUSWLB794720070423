 LONDON  (Reuters) - Britain's AstraZeneca Plc ( AZN.L ) has agreed to buying U.S. biotechnology company MedImmune Inc. MEDI.O in the biggest transaction since its creation in 1999, a person familiar with the situation said on Monday. 

 The acquisition is the boldest move yet by Chief Executive David Brennan, who has been seeking to bolster the company's drug pipeline and portfolio following a series of product setbacks. AstraZeneca declined to comment on the pending acquisition, which was first reported by the  Wall Street Journal. The paper said on its Web site the deal could be worth more than $13 billion.
