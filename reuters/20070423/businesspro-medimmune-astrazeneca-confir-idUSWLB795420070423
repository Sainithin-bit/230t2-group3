 LONDON  (Reuters) - Britain's AstraZeneca Plc ( AZN.L ) has 
agreed to buy U.S. biotechnology company MedImmune Inc. 
MEDI.O for $15.2 billion in the biggest transaction since the 
creation of the Anglo-Swedish drugs group in 1999. 

  The acquisition, announced on Monday, is the boldest move 
yet by Chief Executive David Brennan, who has been seeking to 
bolster the company's drug pipeline and portfolio following a 
series of product setbacks.  AstraZeneca said the all-cash deal, which was reported by a 
source close to the situation earlier, was expected to close in 
June 2007.
