 LONDON/NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Britain's Barclays Plc ( BARC.L ) is expected to unveil a deal to take over Dutch bank ABN AMRO AAH.AS on Monday, including plans to sell ABN's U.S. retail bank LaSalle to Bank of America ( BAC.N ), sources familiar with the situation said. 

 Analysts have said LaSalle could be worth between $18 billion and $23 billion, and the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that Bank of America would pay around $21 billion for LaSalle. LaSalle would fill in one of the last remaining gaps in national coverage for the second-largest U.S. bank. LaSalle could boost Bank of America's share of the market around Chicago from about 2 percent to over 16 percent, according to analysts. Barclays is likely to unveil an agreed upon deal to take over ABN AMRO as early as Monday, sources said, just as Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ) moves to simplify a possible counter offer for ABN. Barclays has been in exclusive talks to buy ABN for more than a month. The deadline for those talks ran out on Friday, and sources said talks continued over the weekend and may be confirmed early on Monday. A deal would be the biggest bank takeover. ABN was valued at more than 68 billion euros ($92.5 billion) at Friday's close. The boards of ABN and Barclays met on Sunday to finalize the agreement, one source said. Financial details of the ABN-Barclays agreement were not known. Analysts polled by Reuters last week estimated Barclays would pay about 35 euros per share, but weekend reports said it may pay more than 36 euros. Rivals could scupper the agreement, however. RBS, Europe's second-biggest bank whose management has made several big acquisitions, is considering making a solo bid for ABN, although its current consortium partners would still help finance a deal by buying many of ABN's assets, sources familiar with the situation said. SIMPLIFIED APPROACH A consortium of RBS, Spain's Santander ( SAN.MC ) and Belgian-Dutch group Fortis FOR.BR have said they are considering making an approach for ABN. The three banks are due to meet ABN's management in Amsterdam on Monday. RBS may make an offer on its own and lead talks with regulators, to reduce the complexity of the three-way approach, sources said. The Sunday Times newspaper said ABN shareholders would receive cash and shares in RBS, rather than cash and shares in three banks, which was possible before. Sources familiar with the matter have told Reuters that under that consortium's plan, RBS would take LaSalle and most of ABN's wholesale and Asian business, Santander would take the Brazilian and Italian business and Fortis would take the Benelux retail bank. The Sunday Times report said if RBS bids alone, Santander and Fortis will become silent financial backers and stump up the cash for ABN's Latin American, Italian and Benelux units. "No decisions have been made on the structure. Several options are still open," a source familiar with matter said. A spokeswoman for RBS declined to comment on the report, but said RBS plans to meet ABN management with its consortium partners as planned. She reiterated comments made by the trio on Thursday, that their plans for ABN are "straightforward from a shareholder, regulatory and execution perspective." RBS has long been seen as the most likely counterbidder for ABN, either on its own or as part of a consortium. Barclays and ABN declined to comment. Bank of America was not available for comment. The British bank would be able to offer a higher price for ABN by selling LaSalle or other assets, analysts have said. It has received interest for parts of ABN from rivals including Bank of America, BBVA ( BBVA.MC ) and BNP Paribas ( BNPP.PA ), sources have said. ABN shares closed at 36.29 euros on Friday, up 40 percent since British hedge fund TCI sent the bank a letter in February calling on it to break up or sell itself.
