 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Best Buy Co. Inc. ( BBY.N ) said on Monday it will carry the U.S. broadcast radio industry's high-definition radio technology at all of its stores nationwide, a move that could boost exposure for the nascent system. 

 In a continuing push to expand awareness of HD Radio, which receives over-the-air terrestrial stations with CD-quality sound and multiple new-program formats, Best Buy will sell car radios with HD Radio built in. During the rest of this year, other home and auto products that feature HD Radio will be available at the retailers 832 stores. U.S. radio operators are working to promote HD Radio at a time when consumers are already faced with many digital music options, such as Apple Computer Inc.'s iPod, other MP3 players, and satellite radio. The industry has pledged to spend $250 million on marketing through the HD Digital Radio Alliance. "Following rapid adoption by the broadcast community and an increasing range of products for the mass market, Best Buy's efforts will dramatically accelerate consumer adoption," said Robert Struble, chief executive of iBiquity Digital Corp., the developer of the HD Radio system. HD Radio's are also available at some other retail chains, including Circuit City CC.N and RadioShack ( RSH.N ).
