 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks appeared headed for a weaker start on Monday with eyes on another batch of quarterly earnings, including from Texas Instruments TXN.N, and on shares in companies involved in M&A activity. 

 By 0940 GMT, U.S. stock futures DJc1 SPc1 NDc1 were pointing to opening losses of between 0.1 and 0.2 percent for Wall Street's three main indexes. The Indicative Dow Jones industrial average .DJII, which tracks the 30 U.S. blue chips as they are traded on Deutsche Boerse's electronic trading platform, XETRA, and translates the prices into dollars, was down 0.3 percent. "We continue to see little room for a sustained increase (in U.S. share prices) as Wall Street valuations are high in an international comparison and due to the slowing earnings dynamics in the U.S. corporate sector," DZ Bank said in a strategy note. On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  rose 1.20 percent to 12,961.98 points, its third straight record close. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  rose 0.93 percent and the Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  climbed 0.84 percent. "By the end of this week an overall picture (of U.S. corporate earnings) will have emerged," German bank LBBW said, noting more than 150 S&P 500-companies are due to publish numbers for the January-March quarter this week. On Monday, Texas Instruments Inc. TXN.N, the world's largest maker of chips for mobile phones, is expected to report Q1 earnings per share (EPS) of $0.31, down from $0.33 a year ago, according to Reuters Estimates. Amgen Inc. ( AMGN.O ), the world's largest biotechnology company, is seen posting an almost 20 percent rise in Q1 EPS to $1.08 while market consensus for communications gear maker Juniper Networks Inc. JNPR.O is for an unchanged EPS of $0.19. For Kimberly-Clark Corp. ( KMB.N ), which makes diapers, wipes and other disposable products used in commercial settings as well as surgical gowns and gloves and respiratory products used in hospitals, the average Reuters Estimates forecast is for an 8.6 percent rise in Q1 EPS to $1.01. In M&A action, Bank of America ( BAC.N ) could be in focus. British bank Barclays Plc ( BARC.L ) has agreed to buy Dutch bank ABN AMRO AAH.AS in a deal which includes selling ABN's Chicago-based U.S. bank LaSalle to Bank of America for $21 billion. Anglo-Swedish drugs group AstraZeneca Plc ( AZN.L ) has agreed to buy U.S. biotechnology company MedImmune Inc. MEDI.O for more than $15 billion, or $58 per MedImmune share, which closed at $48 on Friday. The U.S. macro-economic agenda is light. The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago's March National Activity Index and the UBS/Gallup April Index of Investor Optimism are both due at 1230 GMT. Earlier on Monday, the National Association for Business Economics (NABE) survey of business conditions showed U.S. corporate profits will be smaller, demand for goods will diminish, hiring will slow and weaker economic growth is expected later this year.
