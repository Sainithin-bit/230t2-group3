 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Investor Carl Icahn's American Real Estate Partners L.P. ( ACP.N ) said on Monday that it plans to sell four Nevada casinos to a fund run by Goldman Sachs & Co. ( GS.N ) for about $1.3 billion. 

 The properties include the Stratosphere, which sits at the northern end of the Las Vegas Strip, along with the off-strip Arizona Charlie's Decatur and Boulder and the Aquarius Casino Resort in Laughlin, Nevada. Icahn told Reuters that he bought the assets for around $300 million, so the sale marks a gain of about $1 billion. The sale to Whitehall Street Real Estate funds also includes 17 acres of undeveloped land surrounding the Stratosphere. "Our gaming investments are a successful example of our strategy of acquiring undervalued and out of favor assets, and improving operations and enhancing value," he said in a statement. The deal is expected to close in about eight months. It is subject to approval by the Nevada Gaming Commission and the Nevada State Gaming Control Board, as well as customary conditions.
