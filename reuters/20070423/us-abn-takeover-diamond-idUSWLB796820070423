 LONDON  (Reuters) - British bank Barclays Plc ( BARC.L ) is likely to continue growing its investment bank business by 15-20 percent annually after its merger with ABN AMRO AAH.AS, the head of the business said on Monday. 

 Bob Diamond, who will head investment banking and be president of the enlarged Barclays, estimated there will be about 4,500 job cuts from the combined investment bank, which has just over 20,000 employees, but said growth should not be derailed. "We see huge opportunities to vault this forward and give us growth opportunities," Diamond told Reuters in an interview. "We see the combined group as number five in investment banking revenues with 15-20 percent growth opportunities still ahead of us." Diamond said he will evaluate which areas the enlarged business will focus on, but he said ABN's M&A advisory business will continue to target selected areas and will not be a springboard for Barclays to enter global M&A advisory business.
