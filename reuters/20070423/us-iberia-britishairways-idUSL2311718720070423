 LONDON  (Reuters) - British Airways Plc BAY.L has approached private equity firms about teaming up for a possible takeover of Spain's Iberia IBLA.MC but will not bid alone, Europe's third-biggest airline said on Monday. 

 Texas Pacific Group (TPG) TPG.UL has made a 3.4 billion-euro ($4.6 billion) indicative bid for Iberia and sources close to the situation say fellow private equity firm Apax Partners is also eyeing a deal. BA is considering teaming up with TPG, Apax, or working with a Spanish private equity firm, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. "The airline has approached a number of private equity companies about making a consortium offer for Iberia," BA said in a statement to the London Stock Exchange. "As well as a private equity partner, this consortium is likely to include one or more Spanish partners," BA said, but added that any deal "would not involve further capital investment by British Airways". BA already owns 10 percent of Iberia and has first refusal rights over an additional 32 percent. Iberia's shares have doubled in six months as a deal to liberalize transatlantic air markets and a $9 billion private equity takeover of Australia's Qantas ( QAN.AX ) helped fuel expectations of wider industry consolidation. The shares have been supported by TPG's bid approach and news reports saying Apax was looking at a move on Iberia teamed with Spain's Gestair, a firm which leases aircraft to the airline. Shares in Iberia shed early gains to trade down 0.25 percent at 3.95 euros while BA was up 0.1 percent at 514-1/2 pence as of 1207 GMT. "Even if they (BA) don't get involved, the new buyer is going to want some kind of relationship with BA because they own 10 percent. Many see it as a done deal. The market is quite relaxed about it," said one London trader. Investors will be relieved to hear that BA is not set to mount a costly run at Iberia, said Dresdner Kleinwort research analyst Andrew Evans, who holds a 650p target price and "buy" rating on BA shares. "(This) is a sensible compromise in our opinion. A full bid has been ruled out, which would have raised concerns of overstretching themselves and the balance sheet," Evans said in a research note. "Walking away could have put a full merger with Iberia out of BA's grasp forever. This statement leaves BA in a robust position," he said. PRIVATE EQUITY Earlier this month Iberia asked TPG to spell out who its investment partners might be and to say whether any Spanish companies were involved. Spanish participation would allow Iberia to retain its Spanish nationality in order to retain its foreign landing rights. Non-European Union buyers can hold up to 49 percent of an EU airline but under a new "open skies" pact between Washington and Brussels which takes effect next March that will fall to 25 percent. Along with BA, Germany's Lufthansa ( LHAG.DE ) has been named as a possible rival or partner for TPG. A spokeswoman for the German airline said on Monday that its stance had not changed since last week, when Lufthansa Chief Executive Wolfgang Mayrhuber said Iberia's high share price meant there is "hardly any chance of doing anything that would make economic sense for us". The head of Lufthansa in Spain told El Economista on Monday that if it did acquire Iberia it would keep the flag carrier's Spanish identity. ($1=.7348 euros) ($1=.4989 pounds)
