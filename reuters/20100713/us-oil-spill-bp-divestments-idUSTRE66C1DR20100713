 LONDON  (Reuters) - BP ( BP.L ), which unveiled plans last month for about $10 billion in asset sales to help pay for costs from the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history, said talks on the divestments were making progress. 

 "We are in discussions with a number of companies about a number of assets. Talks are going well," spokeswoman Sheila Williams said on Tuesday. She declined to identify the potential buyers or the assets up for sale. (Reporting by  Eric Onstad ; Editing by Dan Lalor)
