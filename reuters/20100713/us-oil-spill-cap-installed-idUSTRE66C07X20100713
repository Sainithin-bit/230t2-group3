 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - BP Plc on Monday said it had installed a new cap atop its ruptured deep-sea Gulf of Mexico oil well meant to contain all the flow from the spewing well. 

 In an e-mailed statement, the British energy giant said it had installed the 40-ton containment device on the sea floor a mile beneath the ocean surface at 7 p.m. local time (0000 GMT) and "the stack completes the installation of the new sealing cap."
