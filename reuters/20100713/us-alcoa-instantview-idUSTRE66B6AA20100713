 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Alcoa Inc ( AA.N ), the largest U.S. aluminum producer, posted a second-quarter profit on Monday, beating Wall Street estimates as sales soared 22 percent. 

 The company cited strength in several industrial sectors and raised its estimate for aluminum consumption this year. Alcoa shares rose 3 percent in extended trading. Following are initial reactions of analysts and investors: ANDY FITZPATRICK, DIRECTOR OF INVESTMENTS, HINSDALE ASSOCIATES, HINSDALE, ILLINOIS "This is good news because Alcoa tends to set the tone for what comes ahead. The market was looking for direction today, and it's going to use this to set the tone for the rest of the week when there are a lot of important companies coming out, especially in the tech and financial sectors." CHARLES LIEBERMAN, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, ADVISORS CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, PARAMUS, NEW JERSEY "It was better than expected, We were hoping that Alcoa would have at least numbers that would match expectations and obviously they did better, and that's comforting. This clearly gives us a good start for tomorrow. "Expectations have already been pared quite a bit, so Alcoa and others could reduce their guidance for the third quarter, and that guidance could still be a lot better than expected. "There's undue focus on Alcoa simply because it's a Dow component, CSX ( CSX.N ) is at least as insightful and that was also positive, so things are looking good so far." JOHN TUMAZOS, PRESIDENT, VERYINDEPENDENTRESEARCH.COM, HOLMDEL, NEW JERSEY "The results were a little better than expected. Each of their four reporting segments did well. It appeared in particular that their capital spending and cost-reduction programs were working smoothly. None of the four segments dropped the ball." BRIAN HICKS, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, U.S. GLOBAL INVESTORS, SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS "It's constructive and it helps start the earnings season off on a positive note. From the standpoint of Alcoa, they see the economy continuing to expand. It's robust enough that they have to increase their forecast for global aluminum production." CHARLES BRADFORD, PARTNER, AFFILIATED RESEARCH GROUP LLC, NEW YORK "The 13 cents was a penny better than I expected, but the tax rate was low. They only booked 25 percent in taxes and had forecast 32 percent. That help lift their profits a lot. But they did OK in the quarter. "Considering everything going on it was an OK quarter, but not a great quarter. "So far, the aluminum price is lower than what it was in Alcoa's second quarter. I'm looking ahead to the third quarter -- I'm worried about that because I think they could lose money in the third quarter. "If I was just considering the metal price, I'd be very concerned."
