 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid on Tuesday scheduled a procedural vote on a sweeping overhaul for financial regulations for Thursday. 

 Reid and other Democratic backers need 60 votes in the 100-seat chamber to clear the procedural hurdle before they can move to a final vote and send the measure on to President Barack Obama to sign into law. (Reporting by  Andy Sullivan ; Editing by Leslie Adler)
