 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Republican Senator Olympia Snowe, a key swing vote in the effort to overhaul U.S. financial regulations, said on Monday that she would back a final version of the bill that is pending in the Senate. 

 "I intend to support passage of the legislation when it's brought before the Senate for consideration," Snowe said in a prepared statement.
