 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - It is "still possible" that the U.S. Senate could consider a sweeping rewrite of financial regulations this week, a Democratic spokeswoman said on Monday in a statement that suggested the overhaul might face further delay. 

 "It is still possible we could consider it as early as this week," said Regan Lachapelle, a spokeswoman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. Reid has little margin for error as he pushes for final congressional approval of the most comprehensive rewrite of financial rules since the Great Depression. He has yet to lock down the 60 votes needed to clear a procedural hurdle as several Republican moderates who have supported earlier versions have declined to say whether they support the final version. Reid is expected to pick up another Democratic vote when West Virginia Governor Joe Manchin appoints a successor to fill the seat of the late Senator Robert Byrd. But that might not happen until next week as officials in that state sort out election plans. The House of Representatives has already approved the legislation, which is a top priority of President Barack Obama. (Reporting by  Andy Sullivan ; Editing by Theodore d'Afflisio)
