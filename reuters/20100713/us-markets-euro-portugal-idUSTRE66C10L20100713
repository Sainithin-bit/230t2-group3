 LONDON  (Reuters) - The euro fell while Bund futures jumped on Tuesday as ratings firm Moody's cut Portugal's rating to A1 with a stable outlook. 

 The euro fell around 40 ticks against the dollar to the day's low of $1.2523, while it also hit a session low against the pound at 83.51 pence. "The downgrade is going to weigh on the euro in the short-term and doesn't bode well ahead of the bank stress tests due next Week," said David Tinsley, economist at National Australia Bank. Bund futures erased losses, rising to a session high of 129.47, up 13 ticks on the day. The Portuguese/German 10-year yield spread widened to 290 basis points, around 4 basis points wider versus Monday's settlement. The cost of protecting Portuguese government debt against default also rose. The five-year credit default swap climbed to 286 basis points from 279.5 bps at the New York close on Monday, according to monitor CMA DataVision. Portugal's PSI 20  .PSI20  index fell 0.3 percent, while Europe's FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  pared gains, but still traded up 0.5 percent at 1,030.68 points. (Reporting by London markets team)
