 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bank of America ( BAC.N ) could strike a deal as early as Monday to sell about half of its 10 percent stake in China Construction Bank, CNBC reported Friday, citing an anonymous source. 

 Monday brings the end of a six-year lock-up period, permitting the bank to sell the shares. The stake has been valued at about $17 billion. The bank has been holding talks with sovereign wealth funds that might buy its shares. A sale of the stake could raise additional capital the bank needs. On Thursday, the Bank of America said it would receive $5 billion from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway in exchange for preferred stock and warrants. A Bank of America spokesman declined to comment. Bank of America shares were up 2.1 percent in midday trading. (Reporting by David Henry; Editing by  Derek Caney )
