 DALLAS, July 31 - A U.S. judge said on Friday the receiver overseeing the assets of Allen Stanford may sue to recover almost $1 billion (600 million pounds) from 600 investors who bought certificates of deposit in the accused swindler's Antigua bank. 

 U.S. District Judge David Godbey made the ruling at a hearing in federal court in Dallas. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had asked the court to limit the court-appointed receiver's right to pursue the so-called "clawback" claims, saying it would harm innocent investors.
