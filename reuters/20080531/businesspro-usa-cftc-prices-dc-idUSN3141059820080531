 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. commodity markets' chief 
regulator will unveil policy changes next week meant to address 
public and political concerns that market malfunctions may be 
contributing to rising food and energy prices, The New York 
Times reported on Saturday. 

  Citing people who have been briefed about the agency's 
plans, the Times said that the new measures would be announced 
by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which oversees 
exchanges central to the establishment of prices for 
commodities ranging from corn to crude oil worldwide.  Facing mounting political pressure and farm industry 
demands, the CFTC is expected to outline measures to address 
the role played by new financial investors in the futures 
markets, the Times said, in particular those who invest through 
commodity index funds, which have grown from a $13 billion 
stake in 2003 to some $250 billion this year, it said.  Index funds differ from traditional commodity investors in 
that they do not sell commodity futures, but only buy them, the 
Times said. Critics say this has helped drive up commodity 
prices artificially.  But the newspaper said the new steps may fall short of 
sweeping measures sought by the index funds' critics. The 
people who spoke of the new measures discussed them on 
condition of anonymity because the plans are not yet finalized.  (Writing by Christopher Michaud; editing by Patricia
