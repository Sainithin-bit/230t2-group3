 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Scandal-hit Olympus said on Thursday that it was likely to miss a Monday deadline for reporting first-half earnings, which would likely result in its placement on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's supervisory list. 
 Placement on the supervisory list would be an initial step toward a possible delisting of its shares. The endoscope and camera maker said it aimed to report its first-half earnings by December 14. If it misses that deadline, it could be delisted. (Reporting by Edmund Klamann and  James Topham ; Editing by  Joseph Radford )
