ITALY: -- Italy has faced a worsening financial emergency as its borrowing costs have risen to the kind of levels which saw Ireland, Portugal and Greece require an international bailout. Ten-year bond yields are above 7 percent. -- Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has agreed to resign after he failed to secure a majority in a key parliamentary vote this week but he says he will only go when a new financial stability law is passed in parliament. -- The law is expected to be passed by Saturday or Sunday, meaning Berlusconi should step down before markets re-open on Monday. POLITICS: -- President Giorgio Napolitano will sound out potential leaders of a new government to see if a majority in parliament can be formed once the law is passed. -- Former European Commissioner Mario Monti has emerged as the frontrunner to lead a unity government including technocrats such as Bank of Italy director Fabrizio Saccomanni. -- If no new government can be formed, Napolitano has said he will call new elections as soon as possible. DEBT ISSUES: November 14- Treasury to auction medium to long-term debt. GERMANY: POLITICS: -- The Free Democrats (FDP), junior coalition partner in Chancellor Angela Merkel's center-right government, will hold an internal vote in December to determine their party's stance on German contributions to European bailouts. -- The FDP will hold a party congress in Frankfurt on November 12-13.
