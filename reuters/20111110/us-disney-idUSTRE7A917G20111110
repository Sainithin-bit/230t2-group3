 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co ( DIS.N ) reported higher quarterly revenue that beat analyst expectations as advertising held strong at the company's ESPN sports channel and other media networks. 
 Shares of the company rose 2 percent to $35.30 after hours, up from an earlier close of $34.64. The operator of networks ESPN and ABC, a movie studio and theme parks, reported fiscal fourth-quarter revenue of $10.43 billion -- a 7 percent gain from a year earlier. Net income for the quarter rose 30 percent to $1.1 billion. Earnings per share came in at 58 cents. Disney had been expected to show stronger results at media networks after rivals including Comcast Corp ( CMCSA.O ), Time Warner Inc ( TWX.N ) and News Corp ( NWSA.O ) reported gains propelled by a healthy advertising market.
