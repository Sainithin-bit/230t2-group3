 MILAN  (Reuters) - The yield on Italy's 10-year benchmark BTP bond fell back below the key 7 percent level on Thursday helped by signs a political stalemate in the country may be overcome and after Rome raised 5 billion euros in a short-term sale. 
 By 1203 GMT the yield on the Italian September 2021 BTP stood at 6.92 percent, from a closing level of 7.25 percent on Wednesday on Tradeweb. Investors had in their sight the 7 percent level as a sustainability threshold because Portugal and Ireland were forced to seek bailouts after their government bond yields went above it. The 10-year yield spread against Germany eased to 520 basis points, down more than 30 basis points on the day. (Reporting by Valentina Za)
