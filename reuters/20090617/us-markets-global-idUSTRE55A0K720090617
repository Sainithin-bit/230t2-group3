 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Commodity prices slipped on Wednesday as confidence in a swift recovery ebbed, helping pull down stock markets in Europe, while crude oil fell toward $70 a barrel on a surprise increase in U.S. gasoline supplies. 

 A tame reading of U.S. consumer prices helped lift the price of inflation-sensitive government debt on both sides of the Atlantic, and helped spur weakness in the U.S. dollar. Amid doubts about economic recovery, benchmark dollar bank lending rates set record lows on Wednesday in an environment of easier credit conditions with few disruptions seen in the interbank market before the end of June. U.S. stocks rebounded at midday after a downgrade of 22 banks by Standard and Poor's and a disappointing earnings outlook from economic bellwether FedEx Corp ( FDX.N ) weighed on Wall Street earlier in the session. The Nasdaq rose more than 1.0 percent as investors snapped up technology shares after a two-day sell-off, while both the Dow and the S&P 500 clung to modest gains as healthcare advanced. Tech shares were helped after Goldman Sachs added chipmaker Qualcomm ( QCOM.O ) to its "conviction buy" list while Banc of America Securities-Merrill Lynch upgraded to "buy" from "underperform" rival Texas Instruments TXN.N. Networking equipment maker Cisco ( CSCO.O ) also underpinned a tech rally after Chief Executive John Chambers said business conditions were improving. At 1 p.m. (1700 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was up 14.51 points, or 0.17 percent, at 8,519.18. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was up 0.56 points, or 0.06 percent, at 912.53. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was up 12.53 points, or 0.70 percent, at 1,808.71. Drugmakers and telecoms stocks also gained in Europe, but commodity-related pulled a leading index of regional shares down for the fourth consecutive day. "There is a complete lack of clarity as to the state of the underlying economy both here and in the America," said Tim Whitehead, head of portfolio strategist at Redmayne-Bentley, based in Leeds, England. "Although it would be nice to call a bottom of the economic nadir, we are not there yet. We have no evidence to support a sustained market rally from here." The FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of top European shares fell 1.9 percent to a month-low of 845.76 points, but remains up 1.7 percent year-to-date. "After one of the biggest rallies in history, the air was getting thin on the upside," said Lars Kreckel, equity strategist at Exane BNP Paribas in London. Oil prices fell. Gasoline stocks rose by 3.4 million barrels, the Energy Information Administration said, countering analysts' expectations of a fall. That was offset by a big, 3.9 million barrel drop in crude inventories. U.S. light sweet crude oil fell 25 cents to $70.22 a barrel. Copper hit a near two-week low before tracking back as the dollar's weakness helped erase larger metal losses from earlier in the session. A weak dollar makes metals priced in dollars less expensive for holders of other currencies. Spot gold prices rose 80 cents to $934.90 an ounce. U.S. consumer price data for May affirmed expectations that benchmark U.S. interest rates will remain low for some time, a relief to investors worried about a recent surge in Treasury yields, which has since abated somewhat. U.S. consumer prices rose a meager 0.1 percent in May, but over the past 12 months price registered the biggest drop in nearly 60 years. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was up 13/32 in price to yield 3.60 percent. The 2-year U.S. Treasury note rose 2/32 in price to yield 1.14 percent. The dollar was down against a basket of major currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index .DXY down 0.12 percent at 80.644. The euro rose 0.3 percent against the dollar to $1.3871, while against the yen, the dollar was down 0.80 percent at 95.60. Most Asian stocks fell for a fourth day, weighed by resource-related shares and doubts about a global recovery. The MSCI index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS fell 0.8 percent. Japan's Nikkei share average  .N225  rose 0.9 percent on bargain hunting.
