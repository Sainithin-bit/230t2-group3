 PARIS  (Reuters) - The economy is closer to recovery as governments have taken steps to address the financial crisis, the chief financial officer of aircraft parts maker Goodrich Corp said on Wednesday. 

 "The signs are there that at some point pretty soon we're going to get to the point where we have an upturn," Scott Kuechle told Reuters in an interview at the Paris Air Show. "It's hard to tell exactly when that is. I think we're past the biggest threat."
