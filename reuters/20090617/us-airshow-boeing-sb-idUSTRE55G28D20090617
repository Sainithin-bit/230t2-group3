 PARIS  (Reuters) - Boeing Co will remain a strong force in the military aircraft market in the future, said James Albaugh, who heads Boeing Co's defense sector, on Wednesday, citing continued strong demand for Boeing's F/A-18 fighters, its P-8 maritime surveillance plane, and a range of different unmanned vehicles. 

 Albaugh told Reuters in an interview at the Paris Air Show that the company's C-17 transport plane was also still generating international interest. He said he saw a potential market for another 500 F/A-18 fighters and international sales of some additional 100 P-8 surveillance planes.
