 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Chrysler Group LLC said on Wednesday it will resume production of vehicles in seven North American assembly plants by the end of the month, the first large-scale resumption of production since the Fiat SpA ( FIA.MI ) led company acquired Chrysler assets earlier in June. 

 Chrysler said two of the plants are in Michigan, one is in Ohio and one in Missouri. Two other plants are in Ontario, Canada and one is in Toluca, Mexico. The plants will resume production the week of June 29, Chrysler said. The automaker had shut down all of its production while it was in bankruptcy. The Obama administration directed a fast-track reorganization of Chrysler, which entered bankruptcy on April 30. Italian automaker Fiat leads the company that bought most of Chrysler assets. A union-aligned healthcare trust holds a large stake in the new company and the U.S. and Canadian governments also have small equity stakes. Chrysler's powertrain and stamping facilities that supply these assembly plants will also be operating. Chrysler's Conner Avenue assembly plant, which builds the Dodge Viper, resumed production on June 15. But the plants will again be closed during a previously announced two-week summer break the weeks of July 13 and 20, Chrysler said. (Reporting by  Poornima Gupta ; Editing by  Richard Chang )
