 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Ferdinand Piech, a co-owner of Porsche ( PSHG_p.DE ), is resisting a quick decision to let the Gulf state of Qatar take a minority stake in the German automotive group, the Financial Times Deutschland reported. 

 It said on Wednesday that Piech, a member of the extended family that controls 100 percent of the voting rights in Porsche and who is also chairman of its Volkswagen ( VOWG.DE ) unit, had raised doubts about the deal at a family meeting on Monday. The paper quoted a Porsche spokesman as saying no such family meeting had taken place. The news follows an earlier newspaper report from Dubai, in which Qatar's prime minister said he expected the outcome of talks to be revealed in two weeks. Porsche has declined comment on the matter other than to say it was in exclusive talks with Qatar about selling a stake. It needs fresh funds to help handle the 9 billion euro ($12.50 billion) net debt it piled up while building its Volkswagen stake. The weight of its debt and the collapse of global car markets forced it to drop plans to take complete control of VW, in which it now has just over half of the votes. It is instead pursuing a merger whose terms still need to be determined. Porsche shares were indicated 3.3 percent lower before the German market opens at 0700 GMT.
