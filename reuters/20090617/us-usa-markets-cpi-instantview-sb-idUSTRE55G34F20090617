 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices rose at a slower-than-expected pace in May, despite higher gasoline costs, and have fallen over the past 12 months by the most since 1950, according to government data on Wednesday. 

 KEY POINTS: * The Labor Department said its closely watched Consumer Price Index edged up 0.1 percent after being flat in April, below market expectations for a 0.3 percent increase. * Compared to the same period last year, consumer prices fell 1.3 percent, the largest decline since April 1950. COMMENTS: KIM RUPERT, MANAGING DIRECTOR, GLOBAL FIXED INCOME ANALYSIS, ACTION ECONOMICS LLC IN SAN FRANCISCO: "It seems to have given bonds a bit of impetus higher. "I was actually a little bit surprised at that. The market has for some time now been fairly complacent on any inflationary pressures but I guess today's data kind of supported those outlooks that inflation really isn't much of a problem currently. "That's not our view but anyway the market seemed to respond to that a little bit. The numbers are good news in and of themselves." TIM GHRISKEY, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, SOLARIS ASSET MANAGEMENT, BEDFORD HILLS, NEW YORK: "Not much of a response to it. Right now everyone is focused on this correction that everyone has been waiting for. "The CPI was good. The top line number for May was only plus 0.1 percent, that was below expectations. The core CPI was right in-line with expectations. And on a year-over-year basis we're seeing deflation of 1.3 percent overall, although the core is plus 1.8 percent, but still, very subdued inflation. "So certainly a disinflation or even a deflation environment currently. So the worries that everyone has about inflation -- it's something that may occur, it's not going to definitely occur and it's certainly not an imminent threat to the economy. Clearly the Fed sees it that way as well and we expect when the Fed does speak, they will reinforce the fact that inflation is not an issue. "We're looking at a modestly lower opening of the market and the focus simply is with the lightness of volume, the lack of significant trading occurring. Are there simply no more buyers out there currently to step up and keep the rally going? And are we looking at either a flat market here or perhaps a bit of some profit taking." SEAN SIMKO, FIXED INCOME PORTFOLIO MANAGER, SEI, OAKS, PENNSYLVANIA: "The core was spot on; in line with expectations, although the headline reading was definitely lower. "We are slowly working through this environment and it will give the Fed and the markets time to get a good handle on what is happening. "Treasuries rallied on this. The market is looking at this as a non-inflationary sign. Inflation is not today's issue, though it could be in the future." MARC PADO, MARKET STRATEGIST, CANTOR FITZGERALD & CO, SAN FRANCISCO: "Last week one of the concerns that was negative for market and driving yields up to 4 percent on the ten year (Treasury note) was fear of inflation getting out of hand. These numbers today and yesterday clearly show that at least for now the immediate concerns over inflation are not justified." STEVE GOLDMAN, MARKET STRATEGIST, WEEDEN & CO., GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT: "The data was better than expected as far as the broad-based number. As for stock prices, inflation at this juncture in the cycle isn't really a concern. Stocks have had a big run and that reality is setting in, including with FedEx. Stocks have been vulnerable to this profit-taking, but I think they should find some support over the next few quarters." DAVID SLOAN, ECONOMIST, 4CAST LTD, NEW YORK: "It was surprisingly soft on the headline. The core rate was not particularly soft so it is not a big surprise. We see a decline in food, and gasoline was up although energy was subdued despite a rise in gasoline. The surprise came in food and the non-gasoline components of energy. Core inflation is fairly soft. I think energy prices will be up in June." PETER BOOCKVAR, EQUITY STRATEGIST, MILLER TABAK & CO, NEW YORK: "I think it was a non-event. The decline in prices has reversed and the headline number should start to recede. The core number needs to start to recover." SACHA TIHANYI, CURRENCY STRATEGIST, SCOTIA CAPITAL, TORONTO: "Headline CPI comes in lower than expected with core on target. This should help to take some of the inflation concerns out of the Treasury market. For the dollar it is somewhat a positive from an inflation concern but the short term reaction we are seeing right now has been a bit of dollar selling. Current account came in worse than expected though the deficit continues to shrink so it is on a steady decline." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stock indexes were barely higher. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices trimmed losses. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar fell against the euro and yen.
