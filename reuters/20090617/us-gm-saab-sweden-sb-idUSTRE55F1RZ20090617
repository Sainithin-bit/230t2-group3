 STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - A senior Swedish government official said on Tuesday it remained unclear whether Sweden would need to make guarantees for European Investment Bank financing in support of a deal to sell General Motors GMGMQ.PK unit Saab. 

 GM Europe said earlier on Tuesday a preliminary agreement had been reached to sell Saab to sports car maker Koenigsegg. "We do not yet know if Koenigsegg group will need loan guarantees or not," Joran Hagglund, state secretary for Sweden's industry ministry, told Reuters. GM Europe did not disclose terms but said the sale involved expected financing that would be guaranteed by Sweden. "The sale, expected to close by the end of the third quarter of this year, includes an expected $600 million funding commitment from the European Investment Bank (EIB) guaranteed by the Swedish government," GM Europe said in a statement on its website.
