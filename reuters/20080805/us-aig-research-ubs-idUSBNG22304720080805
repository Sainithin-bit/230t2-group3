 (Reuters) - Analysts at UBS upgraded American International Group Inc ( AIG.N ) to "buy" from "neutral" on valuation and said the world's largest insurer was well-positioned to absorb further losses, without a need for an equity raise. 

 The current valuation more than reflects the ultimate economic loss exposure in its credit-default swap business and insurance investment portfolios, the analysts said. Earlier this year, AIG raised in excess of $20 billion to shore up its balance sheet after more than $13 billion in losses over two consecutive quarters. "...We underscore that our buy stance is far from sanguine given past management mis-steps, multiple pressures in its operating segments, and AIG stock's heightened sensitivity to highly volatile credit markets," the brokerage said. The next few years will prove challenging for AIG due to weak capital markets and economic trends, industry-specific pressures and AIG-specific headwinds, such as fallout from its lowered financial strength and credit ratings, UBS said. In terms of potential losses, UBS estimated a $1.4 billion pretax supersenior CDS (SS-CDS) fair value hit in the company's financial-products division in the second quarter. The brokerage also projected $10 billion pretax in credit-related realized investment losses over the next five years. UBS also said with $55 billion in cash and short-term investments as of the first quarter, AIG seems well equipped to meet near-term liquidity needs. The brokerage raised its price target on the stock to $41 from $35. Shares of AIG have tumbled in recent months and are down more than 50 percent since the beginning of the year as the insurer disclosed two consecutive quarters of record losses on investments linked to subprime mortgages. Shares of the company closed at $26.69 Monday on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by Neha Singh in Bangalore; Editing by Vinu Pilakkott)
