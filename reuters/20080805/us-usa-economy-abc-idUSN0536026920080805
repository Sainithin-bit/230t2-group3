 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - American consumers' confidence fell in the latest week to within 2 points of its record low and is on pace for its second-worst year in 22 years of measurements, a survey showed on Tuesday. 

 The ABC News Consumer Comfort Index fell to -49 in the week to August 3 from -47 in the previous week. Its all-time low, reached in May, is -51 and its historical average -10. The index components were mixed, with positive views on personal finances down 1 percentage point to 48 percent and those on the buying climate down 2 percentage points to 19 percent. Views on the national economy were unchanged at a grim 10 percent. Confidence measures are generally viewed as a barometer of consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of the U.S. economy. However, economists note that consumers do not always act in accordance with their statements to surveys. The ABC News consumer confidence survey was based on a sample of about 1,000 interviews conducted in the four weeks ending August 3 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
