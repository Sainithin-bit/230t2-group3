 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve held 
its federal funds rate steady at 2.0 percent, as expected, on 
Tuesday in an effort to nurse the economy back to health 
without further exacerbating inflation. 

 "Although downside risks to growth remain, the upside risks 
to inflation are also of significant concern to the committee," 
the Federal Open Market Committee said in a statement today in 
Washington. 
COMMENTS:
   JOE DAVIS, CHIEF ECONOMIST, VANGUARD, MALVERN, 
PENNSYLVANIA:
   "There are not any surprises here. They are trying to 
navigating a very tough climate, In this environment the best 
is to do nothing. They are still expecting the economy to firm 
in 2009." "In the short-term, it's hard to envision this scenario (of 
a rate hike). For that to happen, you would need to see things 
improving significantly. The labor market remains a wildcard at 
this time. There are other headwinds such as tight credit 
conditions." "You will have a dissent going forward to underscore their 
concerns about inflation. It's indicative of the open 
atmosphere at the Federal Reserve at this time." "I don't expect any adverse market reactions." MANNY WEINTRAUB, FOUNDER OF MONEY MANAGEMENT FIRM INTEGRE 
ADVISORS, NEW YORK: "I don't think they're saying anything new. I think the oil 
price move lower gives them the ability to hold rates steady 
without sacrificing too much in terms of the dollar's recent 
strength. "I also think weakening European economy gives them room to 
hold steady. If inflation moderates you can keep rates lower. 
It's good to keep rates lower because that helps repair the 
balance sheets of the U.S. banks." SCOTT FULLMAN, DIRECTOR OF DERIVATIVE INVESTMENT STRATEGY 
AT BROKER-DEALER WJB CAPITAL GROUP: "The stock market had a substantial upward move very 
quickly after the announcement. Profit taking alleviated the 
upward pressure and returned the benchmarks back to their 
pre-announcement levels. The Fed basically is concerned about 
inflation and the slowing economy and apparently feels that 
taking no action at this time is better than making a change in 
monetary policy. They did note that they stand ready to make a 
decision on interest rates if necessary."
   LEN BLUM, MANAGING DIRECTOR FOR WESTWOOD CAPITAL, NEW YORK: "The big news for the market -- almost more than the FOMC 
-- is oil. The Fed is getting a little bit of relief because 
oil (is below $120 a barrel) and commodity prices are coming 
down. You can't get away from what caused the recession which 
is the weaker consumer who has been battered by rising prices 
at the grocery store and at the gas pump and facing a weaker 
employment picture. The consumer is hurting and consumer demand 
drives 70 percent of GDP."
   SUBODH KUMAR, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, SUBODH KUMAR & 
ASSOCIATES, TORONTO: "The Fed needs to avoid the risks Japan faced in the early 
1990s, so I wanted to see that it had maximized flexibility in 
all three areas: growth, inflation and credit. By referring to 
all three things, it emphasized that it remains flexible. I 
would contrast this with the ECB's recent statements. The 
decision not to raise rates was the correct one, and it has 
given itself room to act according to what needed. The stock 
market may be encouraged a bit by the fact that there was only 
one dissent."  GARETH SYLVESTER, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST, HIFX, SAN 
FRANCISCO: "Overall, I think it is fairly balanced statement. The 
broader question is being how are the FOMC going to balance the 
risk to growth versus the risk to inflation...What they are 
saying is they're looking for moderation in inflation, 
promotion of economic activity, which is the ideal scenario. 
They will continue to assess incoming data and take the 
necessary actions. It does indicate that for the time being, 
rates will be left on hold."
