 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Weyerhaeuser Co ( WY.N ) reported lower quarterly operating profit on Tuesday as the slump in the U.S. housing market hurt its home building business and weakened demand for lumber, plywood and other building products. 

 The company, which also owns vast tracts of timberland, warned it continues to expect third-quarter losses from its wood products and real estate segments. Excluding special items, second-quarter earnings fell to $7 million, or 3 cents a share, from $104 million, 48 cents a share, a year earlier. But Deutsche Bank analyst Mark Wilde noted the 3 cent profit does not factor in depreciation from the company's packaging business, which has been sold to International Paper ( IP.N ). If included, the company would have posted an adjusted loss of about 15 cents per share, Wilde said in a research note. Analysts on average had forecast a loss of 20 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. "Earnings were slightly better than expected, but not as good as the positive 3 cents adjusted number would imply," said Longbow analyst Joshua Zaret. Weyerhaeuser posted a net loss of $96 million, or 45 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $32 million, or 15 cents a share. The company's wood products segment posted a pre-tax loss of $164 million, while its real estate business had a pre-tax loss of $337 million. Quarterly net sales fell 16.7 percent to $3.61 billion, hurt by weak pricing and demand. Wall Street had forecast $3.65 billion. On an inflation-adjusted basis, prices for many wood products used in home construction have hit record lows in recent months. Weyerhaeuser is among the companies hardest hit, as many of its products are dependent on the market for single- family homes. MINERAL RIGHTS The Federal Way, Washington-based company owns sub-surface mineral rights to about 6 million acres of land in North America. A good portion of these land holdings are located in the vicinity of known oil, natural gas and coal deposits, in Louisiana, Mississippi, Oregon and Washington. Last week, International Paper agreed to sell the rights to drill on 13,000 acres in the Haynesville Shale in Louisiana to natural gas company Chesapeake Energy Corp ( CHK.N ) for $263 million. Chesapeake and other energy companies have been snapping up mineral rights in the Haynesville Shale, a formation that is believed to hold massive reserves of natural gas. Weyerhaeuser, which has traditionally leased mineral rights, would also consider selling these rights, the company's management said in responding to analysts questions on a conference call. Weyerhaeuser shares were up 30 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $54.86 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by Euan Rocha; editing by John Wallace and  Andre Grenon )
