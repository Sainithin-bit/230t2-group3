 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. network equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc posted a quarterly profit that edged above Wall Street expectations, sending its shares up 2 percent. 

 COMMENTARY: MARK MCKECHNIE, ANALYST, AMERICAN TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH "It was a solid clean result." "They did say book to bill was strong. That's good to hear in an uncertain economy." CHRISTOPHER BAGGINI, ABERDEEN ASSET MANAGEMENT,  CONSOHOCKEN, PENNSYLVANIA (OWNS CISCO IN NATIONWIDE GROWTH FUND) "Revenue slightly beat estimates, EPS beat by a penny. Inventories and accounts receivable look like they are in great shape. Cash flow therefore must be pretty strong." (Reporting by  Sinead Carew  and Cal Mankowski, compiled by Tiffany Wu)
