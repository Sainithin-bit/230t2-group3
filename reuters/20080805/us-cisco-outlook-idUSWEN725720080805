 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Network equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc said on Tuesday it expects revenue to grow 8 percent in its fiscal first quarter from a year earlier, but avoided giving a forecast for the full year. 

 Cisco also forecast revenue growth of 8.5 percent in the second quarter. It earlier reported fourth quarter revenue of $10.4 billion, up 9.9 percent from a year earlier. Cisco Chief Executive John Chambers said on a conference call that the company stood by its long-term revenue growth forecast of 12 percent to 17 percent, but that a challenging economic environment would last a few more quarters.
