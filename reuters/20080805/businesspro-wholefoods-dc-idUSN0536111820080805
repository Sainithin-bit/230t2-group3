 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Whole Foods Market WFMI.O posted a 
lower quarterly profit that missed Wall Street estimates on 
Tuesday, and suspended its dividend as the weak U.S. economy 
hurt sales, pushing down its shares 14 percent in extended 
trading. 

  The natural foods grocery chain, which a year ago bought 
rival Wild Oats for $565 million, said annual sales growth 
would likely trail previous forecasts even though sales at 
established stores rose 1.5 percent in the first four weeks of 
the current, fiscal fourth quarter.  Results "are not good," said Edward Jones analyst Stephanie 
Hoff, who said comparable-store sales growth for the fiscal 
third quarter was also short of expectations.  "You have a company that used to post above the main-line 
grocery stores now posting more in-line with grocery, so I 
think that's suggesting a share shift," she added.  The Austin, Texas-based company had fiscal third-quarter 
net income of $33.9 million, or 24 cents per diluted share, 
compared with its year-earlier net income of $49.1 million, or 
35 cents per share.  Analysts had expected a profit of 31 cents a share, 
according to Reuters Estimates.  Charges related to the Wild Oats acquisition lowered 
earnings by about 3 cents per share, Whole Foods said.  Revenue rose nearly 22 percent in the quarter to $1.8 
billion, below the $1.9 billion analysts had expected.  Comparable store sales rose 2.6 percent and identical store 
sales, excluding two relocated stores and two major expansions, 
rose 1.9 percent. Those figures are used to gauge health at 
grocery stores.  Whole Foods said it was suspending its quarterly dividend 
and added it was cutting store growth for fiscal 2009 to about 
15. The company had previously planned 25 to 30 new stores for 
2009.  It forecast a profit of 93 cents to 95 cents a share for 
the full year. Analysts expected $1.15 a share for the year, 
according to Reuters Estimates.  The company's shares fell about 14 percent to $19.64 in 
trading after the bell from their $22.92 close on Nasdaq.  (Reporting by  Karen Jacobs , editing by Richard Chang)
