 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co ( PG.N ), the world's largest consumer products company, posted higher quarterly profit on Tuesday, as price increases and cost controls more than offset soaring costs for oil and other commodities. 

 The company also said that earnings per share are still expected to increase by at least 10 percent, excluding one-time items, in the current fiscal year, which began July 1, even though the company said it expects to spend $3 billion more on commodities and energy. "They just reiterated that it's going to be bumpy, it's going to be choppy, but we're going to keep making the numbers that we are setting out for you," said Morningstar analyst Lauren DeSanto. The expected commodity and energy cost increase for fiscal 2009 is twice the increase P&G saw in the last fiscal year. "It's just a tough environment and they are, in the next fiscal year, going to feel the brunt in the recent run-up in oil and commodity costs," SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst William Chappell said. Chappell has a "neutral" rating on the company, which makes products ranging from Pampers diapers to Olay skin-care products. The company said it has been increasing prices in amounts that will offset the higher costs. P&G shares were up more than 2 percent Tuesday afternoon. The world's largest consumer products maker said profit in the fiscal fourth quarter ended June 30 rose to $3.02 billion, or 92 cents a share, from $2.27 billion, or 67 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding benefits from the adjustment of tax reserves, earnings were 80 cents a share. On that basis, analysts' average forecast was 78 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 10 percent to $21.27 billion topping analysts' average forecast of $21.04 billion and helped by sales in emerging markets, price increases and the impact of the weaker dollar, which boosts the value of sales in countries outside the United States. CONSUMERS TRADING DOWN Organic sales, which exclude the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange, rose 5 percent. Like most consumer products companies, P&G has raised prices and cut expenses to cope with rising costs for energy, resin and other raw materials. Analysts and investors have been watching closely for signs that those price increases will drive consumers to trade down to lower-priced items. P&G said on Tuesday that there are signs that is happening in some categories -- including laundry detergent, where sales volume of its Tide laundry detergent has slowed while lower-priced Gain has maintained high-single digit percentage increases. "We have seen some trade-down to lower priced brands that are still P&G brands," Chief Financial Officer Clayton Daley said during a conference call with analysts. That comment was a sign of the depth of P&G's portfolio, which could help it weather the sluggish economy. "There's a sense with P&G that all they have left is premium brands, but that is not the case," DeSanto said. Still, Daley said there are categories where consumers will trade up should innovation warrant. He cited hair care and deodorant as two examples. The company forecast fiscal 2009 earnings of $3.80 to $3.87 a share, excluding a 50 cent a share gain from the sale of the Folgers coffee business and 12 cents a share in increased restructuring costs. Analysts' average forecast is $3.86. P&G shares were up $1.49 at $67.31 on Tuesday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock is down about 8 percent this year, compared with a 13 percent drop for the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI , which includes P&G as a component.
