 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - D.R. Horton Inc ( DHI.N ), the largest U.S. home builder, posted a bigger-than-expected third- quarter loss on Tuesday as it wrote down the value of more holdings in a decimated real estate market. 

 The loss narrowed to $399.3 million, or $1.26 per share, from $823.8 million, or $2.62 per share, a year earlier, but lagged analyst estimates of 82 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Home-building revenue in the third quarter ended June 30 dropped to $1.4 billion from $2.5 billion a year earlier, as the number of homes sold fell 36 percent to 6,167. This was the fourth consecutive quarterly loss for D.R. Horton, whose traditional customers are first- or second-time home buyers. The company builds homes in 27 states with sales prices ranging between $90,000 and $900,000. With foreclosures rising and home prices falling, the worst U.S. housing slump in decades has helped push three builders into bankruptcy: Tousa Inc, Levitt & Sons and, on Monday, WCI Communities Inc WCIMQ.PK. The survivors have had to mark down the value of their inventories. D.R. Horton's latest loss included $330.4 million in charges for inventory impairments and write-offs for land the company owns, but does not believe it can profitably develop. Projects in California, the West and the Midwest absorbed 70 percent of those charges, the company said during its conference call. The Carolinas, where the company raised prices slightly and will continue building, proved more robust, as did Texas. In response to the deteriorating market, builders have shifted their focus from profit and growth to cash generation by ramping up incentives and selling the land and inventory they accumulated at peak prices during boom times. Horton had chopped its supply of lots by 27 percent to 169,000 from the beginning of the fiscal year. In May, the company cut its quarterly dividend to 7.5 cents per share from 15 cents to conserve cash. Horton's "cash flow generation remained strong," wrote JPMorgan analyst Michael Rehaut, who rates the shares "neutral." The company had already met its cash flow target of $1 billion for the fiscal year and added $400 million in the third quarter for total net cash from operations of $1.4 billion year-to-date. But the pursuit of cash can further diminish profitability. D.R. Horton's gross profit margins on home sales revenue in the third quarter was 10.1 percent compared with 16.7 percent last year. The company attributed much of the quarter's margin decline to an increased use of sales incentives, which is also reflected in the 10.5 percent decrease year-to-year in the average closing price to $229,400. Horton's shares rose as much as 3.3 percent to $11.55, but erased their gains, falling as low as $10.68 per share amid pessimistic commentary from company executives regarding diminished customer traffic and competition from cheap foreclosed homes. "The dark side: there's minimum pricing power in the markets in which we operate. There's continued weakness in the financials and the mortgage industry. There's continued weakness in the U.S. consumer and consumer confidence," said Chief Executive Don Tomnitz, adding that the company is disappointed with the recently passed housing bill. The bill's tax credit for first-time buyers does not offset the law's elimination of down payment assistance programs, Tomnitz said. Down payment assistance enables builders or other home sellers to give buyers a percentage of the down payment outright. So far this year, 21 percent of D.R. Horton's closings used down payment assistance versus 7 percent in fiscal year 2007, spokeswoman Jessica Hansen said. Net orders fell 36 percent to 5,501, while order value tumbled 40 percent to $1.2 billion, the Fort-Worth, Texas-based company said. The declining order trends point to more charges ahead, JPMorgan's Rehaut said. Relative to its rivals, D.R. Horton has more land, leaving it more exposed to the downturn, UBS analyst David Goldberg wrote in a note. He rates Horton's shares a "sell." D.R. Horton shares recovered somewhat in the afternoon to trade at $10.95, down 2.4 percent. The shares are off about 14 percent this year, about even with the broader market as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500 index  .SPX  and edging out the sector, down about 16 percent.
