 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Concern about the United States possibly hitting the statutory debt limit has not shown up in Treasury bond yields, a U.S. Treasury official said on Thursday. 

 The official, speaking to reporters about a Treasury request to Congress to lift the limit, said bond investors have seen many episodes of political wrangling over the debt limit before, and Congress has always acted to raise it. Recent increases in Treasury yields reflect a brightening economic outlook and an investment shift toward riskier assets, such as stocks, the official added. (Editing by  James Dalgleish )
