 BANGALORE  (Reuters) - Costco Wholesale Corp posted a 6 percent rise in December sales at stores open at least a year, helped by higher gasoline prices and strengthening foreign currencies. 

 The largest U.S. warehouse club company, which operates 582 warehouses across the world, recorded 12 percent same-store sales growth at its international segment, while U.S. same-store sales rose 4 percent during the period. For the five weeks ended January 2, net sales at Issaquah, Washington-based Costco rose 11 percent to $9.19 billion from $8.26 billion last year.
