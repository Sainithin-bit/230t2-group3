 BEIJING  (Reuters) - China's central bank will keep the task of reining in price pressures at the top of its policy agenda in 2011 by draining excess cash from the system. 

 In a statement published on its website on Thursday, the central bank said it also aims to make the yuan more "flexible." The yuan's value is currently controlled by the central bank. (Reporting by Langi Chiang, Aileen Wang and Koh Gui Qing)
