 LISBON  (Reuters) - Portugal's six-month borrowing costs soared on Wednesday from a previous auction in September, keeping the country in the focus of persistent market concerns about euro zone debt as it held its first debt auction of 2011. 

 The six-month T-bill yield jumped to a new euro lifetime record of 3.686 percent from 2.045 percent on Sep. 1, but came largely in line with expectations and secondary market rates. The IGCP debt agency sold all 500 million euros ($664 million) in T-bills on offer and demand outstripped supply by 2.6 times, up from 2.4 times in September.
