 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Boeing Co ( BA.N ) delivered 116 commercial airplanes in the fourth quarter, down from 122 a year earlier, the company said on Thursday. 

 The world's second-largest commercial planemaker after Airbus ( EAD.PA ) said 95 of those deliveries were of its 737 Next Generation, compared with 92 a year earlier. The company delivered 18 widebody 777s in the fourth quarter, down from 25 a year earlier. The deliveries bring the 2010 total to 462 planes for Boeing Commercial Airplanes, compared with 481 in 2009. Boeing gets paid for its planes at delivery. The company said it had booked 530 net orders in 2010 as the global economy recovered from a downturn in recent years. Boeing reported only 142 net orders in 2009 as airline customers struggled. The company said its order backlog for its 737, 777, 747, 767 and 787 models amounted to 3,443 planes at the end of 2010. Boeing said it would provide a forecast of 2011 commercial airplane deliveries when it releases year-end earnings January 26. Shares of Boeing, a component of the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI , were up 0.6 percent at $67.88 on Nasdaq. (Reporting by Kyle Peterson; Editing by  Derek Caney  and Lisa Von Ahn)
