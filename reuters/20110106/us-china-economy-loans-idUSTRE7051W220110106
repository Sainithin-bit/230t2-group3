 BEIJING  (Reuters) - Chinese banks are set for their customary early-year lending blast and the ritual poses bigger risks than in the past, threatening to flood the economy with cash just as the government tightens policy to curb inflation. 

 In what has become a game of cat and mouse, regulators are trying to devise new ways to thwart the lending surge and banks are looking for new ways around them. Several executives at Chinese lenders told Reuters that the incentives to rush credit out the door at the start of the year are simply too strong. Those who are the fastest and most aggressive early on can secure a bigger slice of the overall pie at the expense of the competition. "Everybody knows the lending quota will shrink this year and this will push banks to scramble for a bigger share at the very beginning of 2011," said an executive with a big bank in Beijing. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media. As a centerpiece of its economic policy, China sets an annual new lending quota for the banking sector. Because inflation is running at its fastest in more than two years, there has been much speculation that the government will keep the target level with last year's 7.5 trillion yuan ($1.1 trillion) or even lower it. The very prospect of a lower ceiling could produce the opposite of its intended effect. "More new loans will be lent in the early months of this year than in the same period last year," said Li Shanshan, a banking analyst at Bocom International in Beijing. She estimated that about 40 percent of new loans in 2011 would be issued in the first quarter, compared with about a third of last year's total. That could be playing with fire. By pumping too much cash into the economy early on, banks risk derailing Beijing's plan to rein inflation with gradual measured tightening, raising inflation expectations and the specter of much harsher tightening later this year. "They will have to control loan growth. Otherwise, inflation will be out of control," said Ting Lu, an economist with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch in Hong Kong. He forecast that new lending could be capped at 7.0-7.5 trillion yuan this year. NEW CONTROLS Regulators must not back down from trying to rein in banks, even if they are bound to search for new loopholes, such as off-balance-sheet lending through trusts which thrived last year, analysts said. Any sign of yielding could open the credit floodgates and stoke higher inflation. Consumer prices rose 5.1 percent in the year to November, a 28-month high. The central bank has already showed that it is willing to raise required reserves to a record 19 percent and use administrative "window" guidance to stay on top of lenders. It will also deploy a range of new tools. Central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan has said that select banks will be forced to lock up more of their deposit base via differentiated reserve requirements. "The central bank will definitely single out aggressive banks for punitive reserve ratios and some may also be forced to purchase central bank bills," said Du Zhengzheng, an economist at Bohai Securities in Tianjin. Beijing might also ask heavy lenders to meet higher capital adequacy ratios and to set aside more provisions for bad loans, said Cai Rong, a banking analyst at China Everbright Securities. Beijing actually scored a measure of success last year in avoiding big ups and downs in lending, keeping monthly new loans to about $600 billion from the second quarter on. SAME PROBLEM But whatever steps the government takes, there is little it can do to block a first-quarter lending surge. On the demand side, there is a pent-up need for credit because of the suppression of lending at the end of the year. On the supply side, banks scramble to book as many loans as they can at the start of the year, aware that it is only a matter of time before regulators clamp down on them. "This has been a habit for the industry and it will be no exception this year, no matter how high inflation is," said a senior executive at a medium-sized bank in Beijing. "You'll never know where the regulators' bottom line lies if you don't take some risks to test it," he added. "It is just like naughty kids who do something wrong, and their father comes out and scolds them. But it's no use, you know they will keep doing that." New loans extended in the first quarter have accounted for an average of 33 percent of the full-year total over the past decade, according to official data. Du at Bohai Securities projected that new loans in the first quarter this year would be more or less in line with that. But at least some think that the start-of-year lending surge will be milder than in the past. "Banks may be less aggressive in front-loading loans for fear of a tough response from regulators," said Liu, the executive with a big bank in Beijing. (Editing by Don Durfee and  Tomasz Janowski )
