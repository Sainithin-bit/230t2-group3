 OTTAWA  (Reuters) - The C$4 billion ($3.3 billion) in Canadian loans to the auto industry will be going to General Motors Corp and Chrysler only, government spokesman Darren Cunningham said on Saturday. 

 "Ford didn't have a specific ask" for short-term funding, said Cunningham, spokesman for Industry Minister Tony Clement. "When Ford asks to be involved, the program is open to them." He said Ford would benefit from two separate programs announced by Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, one to provide additional account receivable insurance coverage to automotive suppliers and the other to set up a facility for consumers.
