 (Correcting date from July 29)    
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Cable operator Comcast Corp ( CMCSA.O ) said second-quarter net profit and free cash flow rose as the slow down in U.S. homebuilding reduced its spending on the installation of new cable. 

 Net profit rose to $632 million, or 21 cents a share, from $588 million, or 19 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 11 percent to $8.553 billion. Wall Street expected Comcast to post revenue of $8.574 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Comcast, which has more than 24 million subscribers across the U.S, said free cash flow more than tripled to $1.163 billion largely due to a drop in capital expenditures compared with the year-earlier period. The company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities. (Reporting by  Yinka Adegoke ; Editing by  Derek Caney )
