 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) plans to use the 
$1 billion it saved by cutting 4,800 jobs this year to hire 
top-level executives in areas like derivatives, risk management 
and proprietary trading, the Financial Times reported. 

  Morgan Stanley is expected to underline its recruitment 
strategy as early as Thursday, with the announcement of key 
hires, including Luc Francois, former head of equities at 
Societe Generale ( SOGN.PA ), who will become head of European 
equities and global head of equity derivatives, the FT said.  Francois left SocGen after the trading scandal at the 
French bank.  Citing people close to the company, the FT said Morgan 
Stanley has already invested $400 million of the savings in 
salaries and bonuses for its new staff.  The remaining $600 million could be used before the end of 
the year to hire new people, the FT added, citing those people.  (Reporting by  Aarthi Sivaraman ; Editing by  Gary Hill )
