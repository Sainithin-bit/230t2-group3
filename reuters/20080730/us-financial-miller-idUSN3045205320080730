 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Bill Miller, stock picker at U.S. asset manager Legg Mason Inc ( LM.N ), said on Wednesday financial stocks appear to have hit a "capitulation low" in mid-July but added it was not clear if they should be bought now. 

 Miller, whose main Value Trust fund has rebounded in July but is still the worst performer among peers this year, said the "frenzy" over the capital concerns of mortgage finance firms Fannie Mae FNM.N and Freddie Mac FRE.N "sent financials to what looks like a capitulation low on July 15." But despite their extremely low valuations, Miller, in his quarterly letter to Value Trust shareholders, did not make a case for buying financial stocks at these levels. "Is it obvious financials should be bought now, having reached the most oversold levels since the 1987 Crash, and the lowest valuations since the last great buying opportunity in 1990 and 1991? Or is it obvious they should be avoided, since the credit problems are in the papers every day and write-offs and provisioning will likely continue into 2009," Miller wrote in his July 27 letter, which was released on Wednesday. "When I ask what is obvious now, there is little consensus," Miller wrote. Miller, 53, is the only manager to have beaten the Standard & Poor's 500 index for 15 years in a row through 2005. But his performance has deteriorated since and has plunged in 2008, hurt by its sizable holdings of financial stocks such as Citigroup ( C.N ), Merrill Lynch MER.N and Freddie Mac. The fund is down 28.93 percent in 2008 through Tuesday's close compared with the S&P 500's negative 13 percent return, according to Lipper Inc data. It has also shrunk in size to $9.7 billion as of the end of June from about $17 billion at the end of 2007. But performance has bounced back as financials have recovered since mid-July and as the fund has little exposure to the falling commodities sector. The fund is down only 0.46 percent in July, outperforming the negative 1.2 percent return of the S&P 500 index, according to Lipper data. Jeff Tjornehoj, senior research analyst at Lipper, said it is too early to celebrate Miller's comeback. "Investors have to bear in mind that we saw points like this in the last couple of years in this fund but he didn't have enough of those months to make up for earlier losses," Tjornehoj said. Lipper is a unit of Thomson Reuters Corp TRIL.L ( TRI.TO ). Miller said investors would suffer steeper losses this year from holding oil stocks such as Tesoro Corp ( TSO.N ) or Valero Energy ( VLO.N ) than from holding Citigroup or Merrill. Value Trust does not own Tesoro or Valero. The fund owned 35 names as of June 30. Its main holdings changed somewhat in the second quarter from the first quarter. As of June 30, power producer AES Corp ( AES.N ) had replaced online retailer Amazon.com ( AMZN.O ) as the fund's top holding, while Internet media firm Yahoo ( YHOO.O ) as well as retailer Sears Holding Corp ( SHLD.O ) and Freddie were no longer in the top 10. Information technology made up 29.8 percent of the portfolio and financials made up 19.6 percent. Miller noted that current market conditions were the most difficult he had seen but said he was an optimist as it was obvious that the credit and housing crises will end and the American consumer will spend sufficiently to keep the economy moving forward in the longer term. "It is obvious stock prices will be higher in the future than they are now," Miller wrote. (Editing by  Brian Moss  and Gunna Dickson)
