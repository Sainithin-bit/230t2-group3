 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Private employers added 9,000 jobs in July, according to a private report by ADP Employer Services released on Wednesday. 

 In June, the private sector slashed 77,000, according to revised data. June was originally reported as 79,000 jobs lost. The median of estimates from economists surveyed by Reuters was for the ADP report to show a drop of 60,000 private-sector jobs in July. The 32 forecasts ranged widely from a decline of 110,000 to a fall of 4,000. The ADP report comes ahead of the government's more comprehensive labor market report on Friday, which economists expect to show a decline 75,000 jobs. That would make July the seventh consecutive month of job losses for the world's largest economy. (Reporting by  Burton Frierson ; Editing by Theodore d'Afflisio)
