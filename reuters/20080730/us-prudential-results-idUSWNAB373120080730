 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Prudential Financial Inc, the second largest U.S. life insurer, said on Wednesday that earnings for its financial services businesses fell 31 percent in the second quarter, hurt by investment losses and lower insurance earnings. 

 Prudential said net income fell to $575 million, or $1.35 a share, from $835 million, or $1.80 a share, in the year-earlier quarter. (Reporting by  Lilla Zuill ; editing by Carol Bishopric)
