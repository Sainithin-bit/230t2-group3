 LONDON  (Reuters) - Bayer AG's BAYG.DE key new 
anticoagulant drug Xarelto has been submitted for approval in 
the United States by its partner Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ.N ). 

  The German drugs and chemicals group also announced on 
Wednesday that clinical trials involving 7,000 patients showed 
there were no issues attributable to the drug, also known as 
rivaroxaban, after long-term exposure.  Bayer estimates eventual global peak sales of Xarelto, 
which won a positive recommendation from the European Medicines 
Agency last week, could reach 2 billion euros ($3.15 billion) 
for all indications.  Although the initial use of Xarelto will be in preventing 
blood clots after hip- and knee-replacement surgery, the big 
commercial potential lies in using it to prevent strokes in 
people with atrial fibrillation, a common heart arrhythmia.  To win big take-up in the stroke prevention indication, 
where patients will take the medication on a long-term basis, 
the drug needs to have no serious side effects -- and so far 
the safety data looks good.  Bayer said no safety issues attributable to Xarelto had 
been seen in around 7,000 patients taking the drug for at least 
three months of which approximately 4,500 were treated for six 
to 12 months or longer.  The medicine is taken as a single tablet, once daily.  It will compete in the surgical setting with Sanofi-Aventis 
SA's ( SASY.PA ) top-selling injectable drug Lovenox, which is 
currently the standard treatment given to patients after major 
orthopedic operations. Worldwide sales of Lovenox totaled 2.6 
billion euros in 2007.  It also faces a newer competitor in the form of Boehringer 
Ingelheim's blood clot drug Pradaxa, which was approved in 
Europe in March.  (Reporting by  Ben Hirschler ; editing by Sue Thomas)
