 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) will continue to offer leases for its vehicles but may make some "adjustments" and "exceptions" to the program, the automaker told dealers on Wednesday. 

 GM plans to continue offering a "balanced menu of options" for buyers including cash incentives, lease deals and attractive financing, one dealer briefed on the plan told Reuters. The automaker told dealers that lease vehicles have become a smaller percentage of GM's sales and GM expects this trend to continue due to the relative high cost and risk of offering leases, the dealer said. A GM spokeswoman could not be immediately reached. U.S. automakers and their financing companies have been losing money on leases because of the sharp decline in the resale values of trucks and SUVs in the face of record high gas prices. GMAC, which finance GM vehicles, and Ford Motor Credit disclosed steps on Tuesday to cut back on auto leases. Chrysler Financial is planning to exit the leasing business completely by August 1. Analysts have said the steps could protect the balance sheets of the auto finance companies, but could cause some loss in sales for the Detroit-based automakers (Reporting by  Poornima Gupta ; Editing by  Gary Hill )
