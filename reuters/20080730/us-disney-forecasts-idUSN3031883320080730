 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co ( DIS.N ) Chief Financial Officer Tom Staggs said on Wednesday that hotel bookings at its domestic theme parks were flat in the current quarter, but "modestly ahead" of a year before in the quarter ending in December. 

 Staggs also told analysts on a conference call that spot, or scatter, ad sales were pacing "well ahead" of advance, or upfront, sales in the current fiscal fourth quarter. The consumer product unit expects to see a modest reduction in profits for the rest of this year as a result of its reacquisition of Disney Stores in North America, Staggs said.
