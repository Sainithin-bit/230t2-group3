 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A report showing U.S. private employers unexpectedly added jobs in July is still consistent with a "modest" negative number in the government's more comprehensive labor market reading on Friday, Joel Prakken, chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers, told Reuters on Wednesday. 

 "I would expect Friday's number to be somewhere in between the number we reported this morning and whatever the consensus was immediately before we released our figure this morning," Prakken said in an interview. "It is probably consistent with a modest negative number, which would be then another month like that." Earlier on Wednesday, a report by ADP Employer Services showed U.S. private employers added 9,000 jobs in July, surprising analysts who were expecting a fall. The ADP report, jointly developed with Macroeconomic Advisers LLC, comes ahead of the government's labor market report on Friday. Economists expect that to show a decline 75,000 jobs, according to an earlier poll by Reuters. (Reporting by  Burton Frierson ; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
