 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Two of the biggest U.S. apartment 
owners reported strong results, despite the absence of a strong 
job market that often fuels their growth. 

  AvalonBay Communities Inc ( AVB.N ), which has expanded in 
highly constrained markets was able to not only push rents 
higher during the quarter, but was confident enough to raise 
its forecast for the year. Meanwhile, its larger rival, Equity 
Residential ( EQR.N ), trimmed its outlook.  The overall U.S. apartment sector has benefited from the 
collapse of the single-family housing market. This has helped 
offset lower job growth, the traditional apartment demand 
growth generator.  Equity Residential reported second-quarter FFO available to 
common shareholders of $187.5 million, or 64 cents a share, up 
1.5 percent from a year earlier. The result beat Wall Street's 
estimate of 62 cents per share and was within the company's 
forecast of 61 cents to 65 cents per share.  The increase in FFO was due to higher net operating income 
and more favorable interest rates that were offset by higher 
taxes and weakness in condominium operations.  Chicago-based Equity Residential, founded by its Chairman 
and real estate mogul Sam Zell lowered the top end of its 
forecast for the year to a range of $2.45 to $2.55 per share 
from a prior forecast of $2.45 to $2.60 per share.  AvalonBay said higher rents helped propel second-quarter 
FFO up 4.2 percent $97.9 million, or $1.26 per share, beating 
the $1.24 per share analysts on average had expected, according 
to Reuters Estimates. The company had forecast $1.22 and $1.26 
per share.  The company, based in Alexandria, Virginia, raised its 
forecast by 3 cents a share to a range of $5.00 to $5.15, while 
analysts saw $4.96 per share. AvalonBay saw its strongest 
results generated from its properties in Northern California 
and the Pacific Northwest.  According to real estate research firm Reis Inc, U.S. 
apartment revenue grew 4.2 percent in the second quarter over 
the year-earlier period.  The strongest apartment markets remain the Bay Area in 
California, Seattle and New York, which posted revenue growth 
that topped 6 percent. On the other hand, markets in the once- 
hot areas of the housing sector, such as Florida, Phoenix and 
the Inland Empire in California have been the weakest as they 
compete with condominiums for rent.  (Editing by  Andre Grenon )
