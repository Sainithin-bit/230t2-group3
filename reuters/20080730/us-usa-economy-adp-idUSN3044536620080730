 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve on Wednesday said it was extending a credit facility that it provides for primary dealers in one of several steps to boost liquidity in stressed financial markets.
    

  KEY POINTS:  * The U.S. central bank said its Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF) and its Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF) will be extended through January 30.  * It also said that it will introduce 84-day Term Auction Facility (TAF) loans, which it said will complement its existing 28-day TAF loans.  * The Fed introduced the loans program to try to ease a credit crunch that policy-makers feel has shown only limited signs of easing.  COMMENTS:  ORLANDO GREEN, INTEREST RATE STRATEGIST, CALYON, LONDON: "This will help ease some of the liquidity fears as we head into the month of August. Of course this time last year, we were heading into the month that saw the spike up in risk aversion and liquidity (problems) that pretty much started the crisis in the financial market. I don't think it's a surprise necessarily, but it's still nonetheless encouraging."  LUCA JELLINEK, RATES STRATEGIST, ABN AMRO, LONDON: "There is an immediate, almost certainly unintentional, risk-premium wobble due to this reminder that the financial system remains 'fragile'. This should help contain financing basis spreads out to the longer, 3-month term. Net of other effects, this could create some tightening pressure in ASW (especially with the rapidly mounting supply of Treasuries, as per the quarterly refinancing announcement). "Critically, the existence (of extended-size, extended-term) swap lines to the ECB/SNB means that the impact should be systemic, rather than limited to the US$ market. Just to be clear, we're not looking for global term-/calculation-basis/FX swap basis spreads to come screeching in tighter. Rather, this measure is probably aimed at preventing them from widening further over the August anniversary of the liquidity meltdown."  SEAN MALONEY, FIXED INCOME STRATEGIST, NOMURA, LONDON: "Throughout the Fed's response to the crisis we have seen a different number of initiatives introduced and I think over time these things have helped relieve some of the symptoms of stress in the market even if at times it was more just stopping the blowout in spreads and all the rest of it moving wider than what they otherwise did. "These things do help at the margin but if you look at what's coming out today they have opted to extend the possibility of these longer-dated auctions and at the same time the swap facility with the ECB is been increased by about 5 billion. "It doesn't look to be a huge amount in terms of new liquidity coming... it just seems to be an improvement in the flexibility of these operations to target where some of the real funding pressures lie which is more in the 3-month area of the money market curve than it is in the one-month at the moment. The extension to 84 days will help in targeting the right area of the market where the pressures are most acute but it's not going to solve all the problems overnight."  MICHAEL MORAN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, DAIWA SECURITIES AMERICA, NEW YORK: "The Fed's moves are positive in the sense that the term funding that the Fed has made available seems to be popular with depository institutions and this is providing even more in longer-term funding so it should be a plus for depository institutions and financial institutions in general. "In terms of the options on the Term Security Lending Facility, I'm not sure that's going to be especially important because the Term Security Lending Facility (TSLF) has not been actively used by dealers. Most of the auctions in recent weeks have been undersubscribed, the notable exception being the latest one where bidding was more than twice the volume of securities was offered. That was Schedule I collateral which was just basically Treasury securities. "In the very big scheme of things, the fact that the Fed is extending these lending facilities to January suggests that Fed officials are still concerned about market conditions and believe that financial conditions remain unsettled."  GEOFF KENDRICK, CURRENCY STRATEGIST, WESTPAC, LONDON: "It's more of the same. The issues in the financial sector are continuing, and the Fed has made it clear over time that it will do whatever it takes to get the banks recapitalized. So these sorts of measures will continue until the banks have more cash. "(The Merrill news) may have had an impact on thinking behind closed doors but the Fed speaks to the banks in great detail, and it would have known what was happening at Merrill before the market did. "The market is quite 'bad news fatigued' now, as the issue (of financial sector problems) have gone on for 12 months. Even Merrill's writedowns overnight didn't shake markets to greatly."  LOU CRANDALL, CHIEF ECONOMIST, WRIGHTSON ICAP, JERSEY CITY, NEW JERSEY: "The PDCF move is an affirmation of the status quo. That's something they said they were going to do and to get in place before its current expiration date. "With market liquidity in the interbank market continuing to suffer with the latest round of credit scare, the Fed is throwing another lifeline. "The introduction of options on the Term Securities Lending Facility will be helpful. This addresses the inflexibility of the TSLF and allows dealers to have the right to borrow from TLSF as needed rather than on schedule against the broader Schedule 2 collateral."  MATT MCCORMICK, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, BAHL & GAYNOR INVESTMENT COUNSEL, CINCINNATI: "It seems to me the Fed is trying to throw a lot of different options out there and seeing what sticks. I don't think the Fed cares which one of them works, as long as one or two of them does. And I don't think the Street really cares either, as long as something works." "The impact is debatable, but at least they're causing some activity." "I have to give the Fed some guarded applause. At least they're not doing what Japan has done, at least they're being proactive on this. And it shows that there's still a need to be cautious on where we are in the market." "The long term effects on the economy, whether positive or neutral, are still to be decided. It shows that the fed is trying to do what is possible to keep the money supply, the multiplier effect going."  STEVEN ENGLANDER, HEAD OF G10 FX STRATEGY, LEHMAN BROTHERS, NEW YORK: "There was a marginal dollar impact. The dollar did move 10 pips lower partly because, it is viewed as a very successful program and I don't think it's terribly surprising that it is being extended. The FX impact is not going to be a big one on this because there's really no immediate knee-jerk trade that you can do."  RICK MECKLER, PRESIDENT, LIBERTYVIEW CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, JERSEY CITY, NEW JERSEY: "A lot of what they're trying to do is to prevent a run on the bank situation, which as you've seen in IndyMac can be very costly. It may well be that the emergency lending programs don't need to be used very much. "They're showing tremendous flexibility in the solutions they're looking at. On other hand problems are complex and in some cases unique. But they are exploring every possible solution. "They're trying to do it a way that it's not clear that there will be a cost.... Paulson said it best, if you carry a big enough gun, maybe you don't have to use it. That's what is going on here.... It's positive for financials, certainly."  RYAN DETRICK, TECHNICAL ANALYST, SCHAEFFER'S INVESTMENT RESEARCH, CINCINNATI: "When you couple that (the Fed news) with the fact that they extended the short-selling rule last night, it shows that the Fed and the SEC are really coming in trying to defend the stock market and financials in particular and doing their best to calm individual investors fears that are out there still."  WILLIAM LARKIN, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, CABOT MONEY MANAGEMENT, SALEM, MASSACHUSETTS: "The Federal Reserve are concerned that the lending situation will get worse." "Right now the Fed is taking every potential option and putting them on the table, because this thing is becoming chronic, especially with the Merrill Lynch announcement of a massive write-down earlier this week."
