 DUBAI  (Reuters) - The deal to bail out Ireland from its debt crisis will take time to reverse market momentum, but growth is likely to return in the short term, the IMF's first deputy managing director said on Tuesday. 

 The extension of Ireland's deadline for plugging its budget black hole is also a positive step but the challenge to stabilize the country's financial system remain. "It isn't just a matter of showing that banks are adequately capitalized. You have to show that they have adequate access to funding," John Lipsky told Reuters Insider. "The European authorities have announced that a new round of (bank) stress tests will, in addition to examining issues of regulatory capital, will also look at the challenge of funding. And that may produce a different answer about the backup facilities that may be required to ensure confidence in the stability of banking systems," he said. Some analysts have described this year's health checks on European Union banks, which none of Ireland's lenders failed, as an irrelevance in light of the Irish bailout. The EU approved an 85 billion euro ($115 billion) rescue for Ireland on Sunday and outlined a permanent system to resolve Europe's debt crisis, in which private investors would gradually share the cost of any future default. "It is not going to be easy, but we expect growth is going to resume in relatively short order if the appropriate measures are taken successfully," Lipsky said, speaking on the sidelines of a World Economic Forum (WEF) conference in Dubai. The European Commission forecast on Monday that Irish gross domestic product (GDP) would grow by just 0.9 percent next year, roughly half the level penciled in by the government just a few weeks ago, and a fraction of the 3.25 percent Dublin was originally forecasting. Finance ministers from the 16-nation euro zone, anxious to prevent market contagion spreading to Portugal and possibly Spain, unanimously endorsed the emergency loan package to help Dublin cover bad bank debts and bridge a huge budget deficit. "It would have been unrealistic to expect that a set of announcements over the weekend were going to completely reverse market momentum. To reverse this momentum will take some time, even in the best of circumstances," Lipsky said. Some 35 billion euros was earmarked to help restructure the shattered banks, of which 10 billion will be an immediate capital injection and the rest a contingency fund. Ireland will contribute 17.5 billion euros of its own cash and pension reserves toward the bank rescue, with the IMF contributing 22.5 billion euros. "Market participants will be skeptical initially, they will want to see actual performance on the economic measures and disbursement of the cash," Lipsky said. "The challenge for Ireland is to stabilize the financial system, to stabilize the fiscal situation, to give confidence in the sustainability of the economic environment for some time to come," Lipsky said. EU finance ministers also approved outlines of a permanent crisis-resolution mechanism based on a joint proposal by Germany and France. Lipsky said European debt worries over the past year and Ireland's bailout were not impacting growth in the Gulf oil-producing countries. "We don't see a direct connection. More important to the Gulf is the health of the global economy, especially the energy markets, but also the strength of Asian economies that are emerging as trading partners for this region," he said. The MENAP region's gross domestic product, which includes Afghanistan and Pakistan, should expand by 4.2 percent this year, unchanged from May's projection, after 2.3 percent in 2009, the global lender said in October.
