 DETROIT  (Reuters) - U.S. November auto sales held above 12 million vehicles on an annual basis, a gain of about 10 percent from a year earlier, driven by month-end discounts and a slow return in consumer demand, according to analysts. 

 Auto sales for November, one of the first snapshots of consumer behavior at the holiday shopping season, are due to be released on Wednesday. "The pace of light vehicle sales appears to have remained above the important psychological level of 12 million units in November," Barclays analyst Brian Johnson said in a note to clients last week. Barclays expects sales to reach about a 12.1 million vehicle annualized rate, down slightly from October's 12.2 million sales rate, but strong enough to show that "the consumer is crawling back, particularly in the more affluent and higher quality credit segments." Hyundai Motor Co ( 005380.KS ) and Ford Motor Co ( F.N ), are expected to have the biggest sales gains, continuing a trend that has seen the two automakers take share from rivals in 2010. The final weekend of November sales were lifted by Thanksgiving holiday deals sponsored by individual dealers and manufacturers, including Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ) and Nissan Motor Co ( 7201.T ), analysts said. "We're starting to feel better about how the market is going," said Jessica Caldwell, an analyst at auto sales tracking and shopping service Edmunds. "It looks like we're in that slow recovery pattern." Economists surveyed by Reuters forecast November auto sales of about 12 million vehicles on the annualized and seasonally adjusted basis tracked by the industry. The U.S. October auto sales rate was 12.2 million, and analysts said it would be encouraging if sales held near that rate in November, traditionally a slow month for the industry. The November sales will be the first for General Motors Co ( GM.N ) since the Detroit automaker's $23 billion initial public offering of stock. Edmunds forecast a GM sales gain of 11.5 percent. TrueCar analyst Jesse Toprak, who sees GM posting a sales gain of about 14 percent, said it was also encouraging that the top U.S. automaker had managed to bring down its incentive spending compared with a year earlier. TOYOTA: "THE BLACK CLOUD HAS NOT LIFTED" Toyota is expected to report a 2 percent sales drop in November from a year earlier, according to Edmunds and TrueCar forecasts. This will make Toyota the only major automaker with a decline in that period, despite having increased spending on incentives from a year earlier. It illustrates the difficulties Toyota still faces in winning back U.S. consumers, almost a year after starting recalls that rocked its reputation for quality and safety. "The black cloud has not lifted," said Toprak. Toyota said on Monday that it would fix about 378,000 Prius models in the United States because of a risk that a coolant pump could malfunction and cause the car to overheat and lose power. Since last November, Toyota has recalled about 14 million vehicles worldwide, including about 11 million in the United States. Toyota is also competing against rivals like Ford and Hyundai, which are gaining ground on the strength of newer products, said Edmunds' Caldwell. "I think the combination is really hurting them," she said. After a disastrous 2009 that saw General Motors Co ( GM.N ) and Chrysler collapse into government-funded bankruptcies, the industry is expected to see 2010 sales of about 11.5 million vehicles. That would represent a gain of about 10 percent. Most industry estimates for 2011 put sales between 12 million and 13 million vehicles. Before the financial crisis, automakers routinely sold over 16 million vehicles per year in the U.S. market. (Reporting by David Bailey)
