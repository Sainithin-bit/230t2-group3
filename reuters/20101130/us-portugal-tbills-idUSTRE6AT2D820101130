 LISBON  (Reuters) - Portugal is likely to pay a euro era record premium when it sells Treasury bills at an auction on Wednesday, reflecting market pressure for it to follow Ireland and Greece and seek an international bailout. 

 The government will offer 500 million euros in 12-month T-bills in a small but closely-watched sale -- the first by one of the other euro zone countries in the firing line since Ireland asked the EU and IMF for financial aid. Dealers say that the secondary market in Portuguese short-term debt has all but ground to a halt, making it hard to project exact prices for the tender. Yields on still liquid 10-year bonds have risen around 40 basis points since the last bill auction on November 17. The average yield on the bills at that sale soared to 4.813 percent from 3.260 percent in early November, while demand fell. Analysts said all T-bills on offer should be sold on Wednesday, but that yields were likely to rise to close to the psychologically important 5 percent mark. "Demand is probably not going to be great, but it's not a buyers' strike. They should clear a tad below 5 percent," said David Schnautz, debt strategist at Commerzbank in London. "The problem is of course that the market is not viewing this level as sustainable for short-term money if we look into 2011. This is going to be another factor that will increase pressure for Portugal to ask for aid," he said. One T-bill trader in Lisbon said there were no secondary market deals on Tuesday. "Yesterday I'd have told you that yields in the auction should be about the same as two weeks ago, at 4.8 to 4.9 percent, but now there is no market. I just don't know," the trader said. Portugal's benchmark 10-year bond yield, which stood at 6.8 percent on the day of the previous T-bill auction, has since jumped to 7.2 percent. Luca Jellinek, head of European interest rate strategy at Credit Agricole in London said all peripheral issuers are facing "very poor market sentiment," but Portugal should be able to place the T-bills if it agrees to pay more. "There is very little appetite, but it does get bought at higher yields," he said. Filipe Garcia, an economist at Informacao de Mercados Financeiros consultants in Porto, said the auction is "an important moment" for Portugal. "The market is putting yields at a level that obliges countries to ask for help," he said. The premium investors demand to hold benchmark 10-year Portuguese bonds rather than safer German Bunds jumped as high as 468 basis points in early trade Tuesday but later rolled back to 458 bps. It settled at 456 basis points on Monday. Two days after the bloc approved an 85 billion euro ($111.7 billion) emergency aid package for Ireland, worries about Portugal and Spain persisted and the borrowing costs of countries like Italy, Belgium and France shot higher. Analysts expect Spain's Treasury will also see yields jump as much as two percentage points compared with October at an auction of 3-year bonds on Thursday, keeping the country near the forefront of investor concerns.
