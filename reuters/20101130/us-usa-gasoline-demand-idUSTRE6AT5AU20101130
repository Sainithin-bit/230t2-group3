 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Retail gasoline demand rose 2.3 percent last week from the week before but fell slightly year-on-year, tempered by winter weather and increased air travel for the Thanksgiving holiday, MasterCard Advisors' SpendingPulse report showed on Tuesday. 

 Average gasoline demand rose 211,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 9.33 million bpd in the week to November 26 compared with the previous week, although that represented a drop of 0.3 percent from the same week last year. Over the latest four weeks, U.S. gasoline consumption fell 0.3 percent year-on-year.

"Demand could have been spread wider over the holiday week. There was strong demand growth leading to Wednesday, when typically there is more fill-up at pumps, but that declined later in the week," said John Gamel, director of economic analysis for MasterCard Advisors SpendingPulse. "This possibly means that consumers took longer trips this year. In any case, these are the highest weekly barrels we've seen consumed since summer," he added. Average retail gasoline prices slid 2 cents versus the previous week to $2.86 a gallon, MasterCard said. Gasoline was 9.1 percent more expensive last week than the same week last year, which accounted for the year-on-year decline in demand. MasterCard Advisors estimates retail gasoline demand based on aggregate sales activity in the MasterCard payments system coupled with estimates for all other payment forms including cash and checks.
