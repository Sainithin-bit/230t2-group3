 CHARLOTTE, North Carolina  (Reuters) - Securities and Exchange Commission attorneys felt pressured to pursue a speedy case over Bank of America Corp's ( BAC.N ) Merrill Lynch buyout and at first skipped more complex legal questions about the deal, a report from the SEC's Inspector General said on Tuesday. 

 In its semi-annual report to Congress, the SEC Inspector General's office said the securities regulator's staff initially focused on the bank's approval of 2008 bonuses to Merrill employees -- rather than the extraordinary losses Merrill would report in the fourth quarter 2008 -- because some officials doubted how successful pursuing those claims would be. "The Enforcement staff felt pressure to bring a case against BofA promptly because of the internal interest in the case and its high-profile nature," the report stated. The report is the first analysis by the SEC's own watchdog of how the securities regulator preformed in pursuing disclosure violations against BofA for the Merrill Lynch buyout. The inspector general found SEC officials did not act improperly throughout the course of the investigation. On August 3, 2009, the SEC announced an initial settlement with Bank of America for $33 million for failing to disclose that it authorized bonus payments of up to $5.8 billion to Merrill employees in the proxy statement sent to shareholders voting on the deal. As part of the initial settlement, Bank of America was allowed by the SEC to retain its well-known issuer status, which allows certain companies to automatically file securities registration statements with the SEC. The inspector general's report said BofA was allowed to retain this provision -- which was later thrown out of the final settlement -- because it was a recipient of U.S. government bailout aid. That settlement was later rejected by U.S. district court Judge Jed Rakoff, but settled in February 2010 for $150 million. Separately, the inspector general's report found the New York Attorney General's office, which was conducting its own probe of the deal, did not cooperate fully with the SEC's New York office. The attorney general's office, run by New York's Governor-elect Andrew Cuomo, failed to share information and provide witness transcripts to the SEC, the inspector general found.
