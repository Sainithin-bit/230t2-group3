 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Barnes & Noble Inc's holiday forecast missed Wall Street expectations, sending its shares down nearly 10 percent, as book sales fall and the company invests more in its Nook digital reader. 

 The top U.S. bookseller also posted a larger-than-expected quarterly loss on Tuesday. Sales at its superstores open at least a year fell 3.3 percent, steeper than its own forecast. Barnes & Noble, which put itself up for sale in August, said it was meeting with financial institutions as part of the auction process, but gave no further details. Last month the company introduced an enhanced version of its Nook e-reader, spending heavily to develop the device and compete with rivals such as Amazon.com Inc and Apple Inc in the growing e-book market. "The physical book side is decelerating more quickly than management had anticipated," said Morningstar analyst Pete Wahlstrom. "No one makes money on physical books anymore." Costs to develop the Nook were higher than expected, Wahlstrom added. The retailer said additional investments in the Nook would peak in the current and next quarters, but increase more moderately in coming years. For this quarter, it forecast a profit of 90 cents to $1.20 per share, below the analysts' average estimate of $1.29, according to Thomson Reuters. Chief Executive Officer William Lynch said shoppers had quickly taken to the NookColor device, adding that the company plans to build on what it estimates is a 20 percent share of the e-book market. Barnes & Noble said it expects same-store sales to rise between 5 percent and 7 percent during the holiday quarter, largely because of demand for the Nook. The company's net loss narrowed to $12.6 million, or 22 cents per share, in the second quarter ended on October 30 from $23.9 million, or 43 cents per share, a year earlier. Wall Street was expecting a loss of 8 cents a share. Sales came to $1.9 billion, missing the $1.98 billion that analysts were expecting. Barnes & Noble's performance suffered because of a 1.5 percent same-store sales decline at its College division, which it bought from Chairman and founder Leonard Riggio last year for $514 million. For the full year, it still expects same-store sales at its superstores to be flat to up 3 percent. In September, Barnes & Noble fought back an effort by dissident shareholder Ron Burkle to win a seat on its board. Earlier this month, shareholders ratified a "poison pill" put in place to stave off any attempt by Burkle to take over. When it reported first-quarter results in August, Barnes & Noble warned that the cost of its legal battles with Burkle would weigh on earnings. The company's shares were down 9.8 percent at $13.41 in morning trading. (Reporting by Phil Wahba; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
