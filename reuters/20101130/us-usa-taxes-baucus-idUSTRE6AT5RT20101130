 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said on Tuesday he will ask Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus to serve on a new bipartisan group formed by President Barack Obama to try resolve a stalemate over expiring tax cuts. 

 Reid said he hopes the group, which will also include Republicans and representatives of the administration, will show there's a good faith effort to come up with a bipartisan solution. Senate Republicans will be represented on the group by Senate Republican Whip Jon Kyl, said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. The House Republican on the group will be Representative Dave Camp, in line to become chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee in the new Congress next year. The House Democrat will be Representative Chris Van Hollen, set to become the top member of his party next year on the House Budget Committee.
