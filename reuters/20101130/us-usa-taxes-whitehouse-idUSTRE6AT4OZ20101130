 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner and budget director Jack Lew could meet four lawmakers as early as later on Tuesday to try to start working out a deal on extending Bush-era tax cuts, the White House said. 

 White House spokesman Robert Gibbs was speaking to reporters after the president held talks with Democratic and Republican congressional leaders, with taxes topping the agenda.
