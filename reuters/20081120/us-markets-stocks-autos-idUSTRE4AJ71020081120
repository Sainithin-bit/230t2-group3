 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of General Motors ( GM.N ) and Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) soared on Thursday after a Senate Democratic aide said senators had reached agreement on a bipartisan auto aid deal. 

 GM shares jumped more than 23 percent to $3.43 on the New York Stock Exchange, while shares of Ford climbed more than 34 percent to $1.69. The big-three U.S. automakers, including Chrysler, are pressing for a $25 billion bailout from the government to avert possible bankruptcy. (Reporting by  Ellis Mnyandu ; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
