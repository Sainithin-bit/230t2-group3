 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - General Growth Properties Inc ( GGP.N ) has hired law firm Sidley Austin as bankruptcy counsel as it negotiates with lenders for more time to restructure its $27 billion debt, the Wall Street Journal said on Wednesday. 

 The move does not mean that a Chapter 11 filing from the company is imminent, the report added. General Growth and Sidley Austin representatives were not immediately available for comment. General Growth, based in Chicago, has $1.13 billion in debt coming due, including $900 million in secured mortgage debt due November 28 on two of its Las Vegas shopping centers -- Fashion Show mall and Shoppes at the Palazzo, and $58 million of corporate debt on December 1. The company is in talks with banks including Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ), Goldman Sachs Group ( GS.N ) and Wachovia Corp WB.N to extend its payment deadline on the $900 million due November 28 as it tries to avoid a possible bankruptcy filing, the Journal said, adding that General Growth was also trying to sell three luxury malls on the Las Vegas Strip.
