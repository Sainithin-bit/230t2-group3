 SIMI VALLEY, California  (Reuters) - Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Thursday declined to say whether the government would step in to help struggling bank Citigroup but said financial stability is a top priority. 

 "I can't comment on any one institution," Paulson said in response to a question about Citi after speaking at the Reagan Library in Simi Valley, California. "The steps that we've taken have been pretty strong ... we understand how important the stability of our financial system is, and stability is our top priority here," he said.
