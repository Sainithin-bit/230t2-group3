 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ) is cutting jobs in its investment bank in line with Goldman Sachs Group Inc's 10 percent cuts, a person familiar with the company said on Thursday. 

 The bank cut at least six equity sales jobs in New York on Thursday and more are expected to follow across the board, the person familiar said. A JPMorgan spokesman declined comment. (Reporting by  Elinor Comlay , editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
