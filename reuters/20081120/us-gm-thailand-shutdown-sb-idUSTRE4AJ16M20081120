 BANGKOK  (Reuters) - The Thai unit of troubled U.S. carmaker General Motors said on Thursday it would shut down its Rayong plant for 2 months from mid-December due to falling demand caused by the global economic slowdown. 

 GM Thailand also planned to cut 258 jobs at the plant, which produced about 100,000 vehicles last year, director of public relations Chartchai Suwanasevok told Reuters. (Reporting by Viparat Jantraprap; Editing by Darren Schuettler)
