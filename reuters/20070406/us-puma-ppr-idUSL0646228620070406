 PARIS  (Reuters) - French furniture-to-fashion retailer PPR ( PRTP.PA ) is in advanced talks to buy out a leading shareholder of German sportswear company Puma ( PUMG.DE ) and bid for the firm, two newspapers reported on Friday. 

 The Wall Street Journal, citing people close to the matter, said two Herz family members, Gunther and Daniela, who control nearly 30 percent of Puma via their Mayfair holding company, were close to selling their stake to PPR. The Journal said a deal was likely to be struck ahead of Puma's annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday and would value Puma at more than 5.4 billion euros ($7.21 billion). In its online edition, the Financial Times, citing people close to the deal, said an offer could be made on Tuesday. Spokesmen for PPR and Puma declined to comment on the reports, saying their policy was not to comment on market speculation. Mayfair Managing Director Rainer Kutzner also declined to comment on the situation. In an advance copy of an article due to be published on Saturday, German newspaper Die Welt said Mayfair "apparently" did not want to sell to PPR. It cited unnamed sources close to the company as saying there had been several past attempts to take over the firm. Puma shares closed up 10.3 percent at 314.25 euros on Thursday on market rumors that PPR could bid for the German group. Based on Thursday's closing price, Puma had a stock market capitalization of around 5.3 billion euros. Puma also said on Thursday that it would cancel 7.4 percent of its share capital. The German group has often been the subject of bid speculation, with some traders saying that U.S. sportswear company Nike Inc ( NKE.N ) could be interested in Puma. WARCHEST PPR reaffirmed earlier this year that it had plenty of firepower to make medium or large acquisitions, although it indicated it was in no hurry to spend any money. PPR owns the luxury Gucci Group, which includes designers Stella McCartney and Alexander McQueen. McQueen has designed limited-edition sneakers for Puma, while McCartney designs a line of clothing for rival Adidas ADSG.DE. PPR last year bought U.S. outdoor clothing and equipment catalogue retailer The Sportsman's Guide and its subsidiary The Golf Warehouse. Gunther and Daniela Herz are heirs to the Tchibo coffee empire. The FT's German sister paper FT Deutschland reported this week that Tchibo, which has a network of shops in Germany also selling household goods and clothing, has hired former chief Adidas designer Michael Michalsky to launch a sport and leisurewear collection.
