 LONDON  (Reuters) - The Sainsbury family plans to reject a bid of about 9.5 billion pounds (18.7 billion pounds) for the supermarket group that bears its name, newspapers said on Friday. 

 The papers said the family's biggest shareholder, David Sainsbury, would not consider a bid of less than 600 pence a share for J Sainsbury ( SBRY.L ), Britain's third-biggest supermarket group. The Times said a private equity consortium of CVC Capital CVC.UL, Texas Pacific TPG.UL and Blackstone BG.UL had put forward a bid of between 550 pence and 555 pence a share. "He cannot see any reason why the board would even consider opening the books at less than 600p-share," the Daily Telegraph quoted an unidentified source close to David Sainsbury as saying. The papers said the family own about 17-18 percent of Sainsbury and the Times said other big shareholders, including property magnate Robert Tchenguiz and Alliance Bernstein, were also reluctant to sell at the offer price. The Daily Mail said the Sainsbury board had also rejected the bid. But other newspapers said it had yet to make a decision. None of the parties involved could immediately be reached for comment.
