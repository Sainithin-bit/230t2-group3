 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Avocent Corp.AVCT.O on Friday said it expects first-quarter revenue would be below its expectations, in part because of a slowdown on overall information technology spending. 

 The company, which makes network equipment technology, said it sees first-quarter revenue in the range of $132 million to $135 million. Analysts, on average, expected the company to generate revenue of $153.11 million, according to Reuters Estimates.
