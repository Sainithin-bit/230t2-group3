 ALEXANDRIA, Va  (Reuters) - A federal judge said on Friday he will allow Vonage Holdings Corp. ( VG.N ) to use Internet phone call technology patented by Verizon Communications Inc. ( VZ.N ) only for existing customers while Vonage appeals a finding of patent infringement. 

 U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton also required Vonage to post a $66 million bond as part of his decision to grant a partial stay that bars the company from using the Verizon technology for new customers. Roger Warin, a lawyer for Vonage, said the partial stay amounted to "cutting off oxygen and a bullet to the head" of the company.
