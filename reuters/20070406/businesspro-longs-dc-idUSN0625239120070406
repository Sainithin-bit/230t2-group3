 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. drug store chains Rite Aid Corp. 
( RAD.N ) and Longs Drug Stores Corp. LDG.N said on Friday they 
agreed to a store swap that is part of Longs' plan to divest 
some of its stores by the end of its fiscal year. 

  Terms of the deal, expected to close in May, were not 
disclosed.  The exchange is part of a plan that Longs announced last 
month to shed 31 stores during its fiscal year ending January 
31, 2008. Under the deal, Rite Aid gets six of the 31 stores, 
including three in Washington, two in Oregon, one in California 
and prescription files from six other Longs stores in 
Washington.  Longs expects to receive six Rite Aid stores in Northern 
Nevada, including two in Reno, one in Carson City, one in 
Fallon, one in Sparks, and one in Sun Valley, bringing its 
total number in Nevada to 24 stores.  "This is a great opportunity to accelerate our expansion 
plans as well as our disposition of stores in Oregon and 
Washington," Warren Bryant, Longs chairman and chief executive, 
said in a statement.  With this deal, Rite Aid will have 138 stores in 
Washington, 72 in Oregon and 599 in California. Rite Aid will 
continue to operate 29 stores in Nevada.
