 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Citigroup is arranging a 1.7 trillion yen ($14.3 billion) line of credit from Japan's three top banks and others to fund its acquisition of Nikko Cordial Corp., sources close to the deal said on Friday. 

 Citigroup confirmed that it had secured financing but declined to say how much. People involved said the credit line amounted to 1.4 trillion yen with an option for an additional 300 billion yen -- a total roughly equal to the maximum cost of Citigroup's bid for Nikko. Analysts say Citigroup has enough cash to fund its planned buyout of Japan's No. 3 securities brokerage, but by raising money locally it can take advantage of Japan's low interest rates and reduce exchange rate-related risks. The credit line "will help us better match the currency requirements of the recently announced Nikko Cordial transaction," Citigroup said in a statement, though it described the fund-raising as being for "general corporate purposes" not limited to the takeover bid. Citigroup launched its tender offer for Nikko last month. It is aiming for a minimum 50 percent stake but is offering to buy all shares tendered, putting the potential cost including outstanding shares and options grants at 1.677 trillion yen. Citigroup and Japan's three biggest banks -- Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Mizuho Financial Group and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (SMFG) -- are acting as mandated arrangers for the one-year financing, the sources said. Mizuho unit Mizuho Corporate Bank has been allocated the largest slice at 350 billion yen, while MUFG's core subsidiary Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ and SMFG's Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. have been alloted 300 billion yen each. Between 15 and 20 domestic and foreign banks are ultimately expected to share in the deal. Participation is open to big names that can lend at least 50 billion yen apiece, the sources said. The arrangers plan to sound out potential participants this month and sign the deal at the beginning of May. Citigroup's tender offer for Nikko closes on April 26. The 1,700 yen-per-share bid, part of a wider strategy to expand the top U.S. bank's international business, would be its biggest-ever acquisition in Asia. Analysts generally expect the bid to succeed, although several major Nikko shareholders are pushing for a higher price. On Thursday, a third big Nikko investor placed a sell order for a large block of stock at a price above Citigroup's offer, a gesture designed to show its dissatisfaction with Citigroup's bid and rally other shareholders to the dissenting side. Southeastern Asset Management said it placed an order to sell 6.6 percent of Nikko's shares at 1,900 yen per share, joining Bermuda-based Orbis Investment Management and Chicago-based Harris Associates, which have already offered slightly smaller stakes in Nikko at the same price. Including other sell orders from minor shareholders, at least 20 percent of Nikko's stock has been offered at 1,900 yen in the last few days. Some market investors appear to believe that Citigroup may now be forced to sweeten its bid. Nikko's shares rose above Citigroup's offer price for the first time on Friday to end at 1,715 yen.
