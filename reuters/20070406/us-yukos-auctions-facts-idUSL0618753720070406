 (Reuters) - Russia will hold one of the last big auctions of assets from bankrupt oil firm YUKOS YUKO.MM in mid-May, with receiver Eduard Rebgun selling off YUKOS's Samara oil production unit and three nearby refineries. 

 To read a separate story click on <ID:nL06532809> Following is information about YUKOS's assets. SHAREHOLDINGS ROSNEFT: YUKOS had a stake of 9.44 percent in Rosneft, which bought YUKOS's former subsidiary Yugansk in 2004. YUKOS retained preference shares in Yugansk. Rosneft consolidated its subsidiaries and floated shares in July. Rosneft itself bought back the stock on March 27 for $7.6 billion, a discount of around 10 percent to the market price. GAZPROM NEFT: YUKOS had a 20 percent stake in Gazprom's oil arm Gazprom Neft ( SIBN.MM ), previously called Sibneft, after an aborted merger. The stake's market value is $3.8 billion. The stake was sold on April 4 in one lot with YUKOS's northern gas production units ArcticGas and Urengoil to Italian energy firms Eni ( ENI.MI ) and Enel ( ENEI.MI ) for $5.8 billion. The Italian firms promised to share the assets with Russia's gas export monopoly Gazprom ( GAZP.MM ). EAST SIBERIAN ASSETS On May 3 Rebgun will auction off YUKOS's 220,000 bpd Tomskneft production company and the Angarsk refinery and petrochemicals plant, which can refine up to 500,000 bpd. The starting price has been set at around $6.4 billion. Rosneft and Gazprom are expected to compete fiercely for the lot. Some analysts also expect U.S. Chevron ( CVX.N ) or private major Surgutneftegas ( SNGS.MM ) to bid. SAMARA LOT Rebgun will sell the 200,000 bpd Samara production unit and the three refineries, which can process 400,000 bpd, in mid-May for $6 billion. Rosneft is widely expected to win the lot. It badly needs refining assets after the purchase of Yugansk. PETROL STATIONS All of YUKOS's 1,135 petrol stations will be sold in a separate lot with a starting price of 7.7 billion roubles ($296.1 million) in mid-May. PROPERTY YUKOS's Moscow property, including the firm's downtown skyscraper headquarters, will go under the hammer for 22.7 billion roubles ($873.1 million) also in mid-May. NON-RUSSIAN LITHUANIA: YUKOS sold its 53.7 percent stake in Lithuania's Mazeikiu Nafta refinery and export terminal to Poland's PKN Orlen PKNA.WA in May 2006. The $1.5 billion deal was completed in December. SLOVAKIA: YUKOS has a 49 percent stake in Slovakian oil pipeline operator Transpetrol, 51 percent owned by the Slovakian government, which says it plans to buy the YUKOS stake.
