 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Vonage Holdings Corp. ( VG.N ) said on Friday the company will be able to continue making full use of Verizon Communications ( VZ.N ) patents for making phone calls over the Internet after winning temporary relief from an appeals court. 

 Earlier on Friday a lower court judge had barred Vonage from adding new customers while it appeals a finding that it infringed on Verizon's patents. "We just learned, just now, from our legal counsel that we secured a temporary stay until (the appeals court) can hear our request for a permanent stay of that order," said Vonage spokeswoman Brooke Schulz.
