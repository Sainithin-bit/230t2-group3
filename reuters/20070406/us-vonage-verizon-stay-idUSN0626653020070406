 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Vonage Holdings Corp. said on Friday the company will be able to continue making full use of Verizon Communications patents for making phone calls over the Internet after winning temporary relief from an appeals court. 

 Earlier on Friday a lower court judge had barred Vonage from adding new customers while it appeals a finding that it infringed on Verizon's patents. "We just learned, just now, from our legal counsel that we secured a temporary stay until (the appeals court) can hear our request for a permanent stay of that order," said Vonage spokeswoman Brooke Schulz.
