 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Sprint Nextel Corp. ( S.N ) said on Friday it will not protest the U.S. government's decision to pass the company over for the largest-ever federal telecommunications contract. 

 Sprint, which has provided telecommunications services to government agencies for 18 years, was recently shut out of a 10-year contract worth at least $20 billion. Instead the General Services Administration chose AT&T Inc. ( T.N ), Qwest Communications International ( Q.N ) and Verizon Communications ( VZ.N ) to partake in the Networx Universal contract. The contract, which can be worth as much as $48 billion, is aimed at overhauling the federal government's communications services. The winning companies still need to compete for individual contracts within government agencies. Sprint said it met with the GSA earlier this week for a debrief on the Networx Universal award. "After a thorough discussion, Sprint has decided to move forward and focus on the future and continue to aggressively pursue the forthcoming Networx Enterprise contract," the company said in a statement. The Networx Enterprise contract is expected to be awarded in May. However, Universal is the more lucrative contract and prospective companies had to demonstrate they could provide 36 mandatory services, such as secure e-mail. Projected spending on Enterprise is estimated at $20.1 billion and only requires companies to show they can provide nine mandatory services.
