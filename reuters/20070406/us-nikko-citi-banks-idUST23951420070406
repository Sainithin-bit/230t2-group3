 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Mizuho Corporate Bank, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ and other Japanese banks will form a 1.7 trillion yen ($14.3 billion) line of credit for Citigroup as it seeks to take over Nikko Cordial Corp., the Nikkei business daily said. 

 Citigroup's $14 billion offer for Japan's third-largest securities firm, part of a wider strategy to expand its international business, would be its biggest-ever acquisition in Asia. The line of credit would include an option for an extra 300 billion yen loan and would be the largest syndicated loan in Japan, the paper said. It will be lead-managed by the core banks of the Mizuho Financial Group Inc., Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. and the Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. as well as Citibank N.A., it said. Other banks will also be invited to participate, it added.
