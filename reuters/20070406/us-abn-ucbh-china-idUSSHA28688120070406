 SHANGHAI  (Reuters) - Dutch financial services firm ABN AMRO AAH.AS and U.S. community bank UCBH Holdings Inc. UCBH.O are among potential rivals seeking to buy a minority stake in China's mid-sized Huishang Bank, regulatory and banking sources said on Friday. 

 ABN AMRO Holding NV has been in formal negotiations with Huishang Bank, based in the eastern Chinese province of Anhui, for at least six months, with the aim of becoming a strategic investor by buying about a 20 percent stake, the sources told Reuters. However, San Francisco-based UCBH, the parent company of United Commercial Bank, the largest bank specializing in serving Chinese-Americans in the United States, recently joined discussions with Huishang Bank, the sources said. UCBH hopes to buy a 10 to 20 percent stake in the bank, although UCBH and ABN AMRO have not submitted formal bids, the sources said. A senior executive for ABN AMRO in Shanghai declined to comment, while officials at Huishang and UCBH were not immediately available for comment. Last week, UCBH said it had agreed to buy Business Development Bank Ltd., a small Shanghai-based lender, for $205 million in cash, as part of its plans to expand in China over the next four to five years. "UCBH is little-known to bankers and consumers in China ... The provincial government of Anhui definitely wants to get a well-known partner for Huishang Bank to boost the reputation of the bank as well as the province," said one source close to Huishang. "But that doesn't mean UCBH has no chance of beating ABN AMRO, as ABN AMRO is keen on getting as big a stake as possible and participation in management of the bank, while UCBH is not that aggressive at this point," said the source, who declined to be identified. UNCERTAINTIES Huishang Bank opened for business in early 2006, the product of the merger of a handful of small city commercial banks and urban credit cooperatives in Anhui province. Singapore's DBS Group Holdings ( DBSM.SI ) also approached Huishang Bank about a potential investment last year but the talks stalled over price and the size of the stake, the sources said. DBS declined to comment on the matter. ABN AMRO, the Netherlands' biggest bank, and British lender Barclays Plc ( BARC.L ) entered exclusive merger talks in March after investors, led by British hedge fund TCI, pressured the Dutch bank to consider a sale or break-up to boost shareholder returns. The proposed merger of the two European financial giants creates potential uncertainties for ABN AMRO's strategy in China, the sources said, adding that there were signs ABN AMRO had become less enthusiastic in the talks with Huishang. ABN AMRO is separately planning to incorporate its Chinese unit domestically, under a Beijing-led campaign allowing foreign banks to offer yuan-based retail banking services without any restrictions. ABN AMRO plans to register its Chinese subsidiary in Shanghai, China's financial hub, while Huishang Bank, a regional lender, is not allowed to operate outside Anhui province, the sources said. BOC International, the investment banking arm of Bank of China ( 3988.HK )601988.HK, is working for Huishang as financial adviser in selecting a foreign investor, the sources said, adding that a formal bidding process could begin in the next few weeks. Huishang, which means "Anhui Merchants" in Chinese, runs about 100 outlets in cities and villages in the inland and mostly rural province. It had total assets of nearly 46 billion yuan ($5.96 billion) at the end of 2005. ($1=7.723 Yuan) (Additional reporting by  Tamora Vidaillet  in Beijing)
