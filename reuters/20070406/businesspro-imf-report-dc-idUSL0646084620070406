 BERLIN  (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund has 
revised down its forecast for U.S. economic growth by 0.4 
percentage points to about 2.2 percent, a German newspaper 
reported in its online edition on Friday. 

  The slowing is only likely to be temporary, as U.S. growth 
is expected to pick up in 2008 to a rate of about 2.8 percent, 
according to a draft of the IMF's World Economic Outlook seen 
by the Financial Times Deutschland.  Preliminary IMF figures last month put U.S. growth at 2.6 
percent in 2007 and 3.0 percent next year, both 0.3 percentage 
points lower than the fund's previous forecast in September.  Worries that the slowing U.S. economy could slip into 
recession have grown recently after former Fed chief Alan 
Greenspan said in February that a U.S. recession was possible.  The newspaper also reported that IMF experts still expect 
solid global growth to continue, forecasting the world economy 
will grow by about 4.9 percent in 2007.  It said IMF experts are now also forecasting that Japan's 
economic growth will reach a high point of 2.3 percent in 2007. 
It is then set to slow in 2008 to about 1.9 percent.  The paper also said the report forecast a growth rate of 
about 1.8 percent for Germany in 2007, which should rise to 1.9 
percent in 2008.  The IMF is due to publish its World Economic Outlook report 
on April 11.
