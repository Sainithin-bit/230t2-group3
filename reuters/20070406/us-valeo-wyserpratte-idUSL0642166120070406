 PARIS  (Reuters) - U.S. activist investor Guy Wyser-Pratte said on Friday he and partners had sold their stake of around 3 percent in French car parts group Valeo ( VLOF.PA ). 

 "I would have liked to have helped them restructure but it seems clear to me now that (executive chairman Thierry) Morin and the board are going to accept an LBO deal on Tuesday," he said, adding that he did not expect an LBO offer to be above some 44 euros, or roughly the current share price. Valeo shares have surged nearly 80 percent over the past eight months, standing at peaks last seen nearly five years ago. Wyser-Pratte said he and his partners had bought Valeo stock at around 27 euros and sold "very recently". His partners were the Cycladic fund and Canadian businessman Douglas Bergeron. Wyser-Pratte, an American ex-marine who was born in France, said he remained convinced that it would be a bad move for Valeo to engage in a takeover of all or part of Visteon of the United States. "I talked to Morin several weeks ago and he agreed that it would make no sense to buy all of Visteon," he said in a telephone interview. Morin has publicly said he ruled out buying all of Visteon Corp ( VC.N ) or Delphi Corp DPHIQ.PK, U.S. car parts groups in financial restructuring, but could consider buying assets they might put on the market. Investment fund Pardus has in recent months increased its Valeo stake to 12.4 percent, making it the biggest single shareholder ahead of CDC, Brandes Investment Partners and Franklin Templeton. Pardus wants a combination of Valeo and Visteon and has identified annual synergies of 300 million to 500 million euros ($667.3 million). Pardus owns 17.5 percent of Visteon, a former Ford ( F.N ) parts unit. TUESDAY MEETING The Valeo board is meeting on Tuesday to prepare for the annual general meeting of May and to discuss an approach by an unnamed private equity fund. A spokesman at Valeo said the group had not been informed of Wyser-Pratte's decision. "As far as I know we have not been informed. We've read it in the press like everyone. It is Mr. Wyser-Pratte's choice and you should ask him directly," the spokesman said. No price for the stake was given, but according to Reuters Estimates, Valeo is worth about 3.5 billion euros ($4.7 billion), making a 3 percent stake worth about 105 million euros. A source close to the matter told Reuters in March that Apollo Investment Corp ( AINV.O ) was studying an offer, while a Valeo spokeswoman said last month the unnamed fund's approach was neither hostile nor solicited. "I don't know whether it is Apollo or not but I do not think that it is only one fund," Wyser-Pratte said. He also believed Valeo had been working on an LBO deal since summer. The mandates of 9 of the 11 members of the Valeo board of directors come up for renewal in May. On March 22, Valeo said an investment fund had expressed interest in the company and the board would consider the offer. In a brief statement following a regular meeting of the supervisory board, Valeo said the board thought it was in the group's interest to explore the fund's offer, in a preliminary and non-exclusive manner, while at the same time examining other strategic options.
