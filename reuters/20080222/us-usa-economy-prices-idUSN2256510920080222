 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Wholesale price inflation was more muted at the end of 2007 than previously thought, according to revised data published on Friday by the Labor Department. 

 The department said that its Producer Price Index, a gauge of price changes at the farm gate and factory door, dropped by 0.3 percent in December instead of 0.1 percent that it reported on January 15. November producer prices that had originally been reported rising sharply by 3.2 percent instead were up by a somewhat more modest 2.6 percent, the department said. So-called core producer prices, excluding food and energy items, rose 0.2 percent in December, unrevised from the previous estimate, but for November the core price rise was revised to a smaller 0.3 percent gain from a 0.4 percent rise. Some analysts saw the revised data as suggesting more leeway for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. "They've been signaling recently that getting the economy in recovery is a higher priority than inflation. This helps support that ... policy," said Subodh Kumar, chief investment strategist at Subodh Kumar & Associates in Toronto. The changes stem from the department's recalculation of seasonal adjustment factors for the 2003-2007 period, which caused revisions to seasonally adjusted indices over the past five years. However, the calculations do not affect unadjusted data, which still shows producer prices on a sharp ascending trend. Compared with December 2006, overall producer prices were up 6.3 percent last year for the largest increase since a 7.1 percent advance in 1981, the Labor Department said. Among the most notable revisions was that for energy prices, which the department now says fell 3 percent in December instead of declining 1.9 percent as previously reported. Nonetheless, over the course of the full year 2007, energy prices climbed by 18.4 percent and gasoline prices were up 37.1 percent in the period.
