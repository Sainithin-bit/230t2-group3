 MOSCOW  (Reuters) - Mikhail Shishkhanov, a nephew of billionaire Mikhail Gutseriyev, has agreed to sell top 50 Russian lender Binbank to businessman and senator Vadim Moshkovich, the bank said on Friday. 

 Gutseriyev is in self-imposed exile with a warrant out for his arrest in Russia. Kommersant business daily quoted Shishkhanov as saying he had agreed to sell as the deal would allow Binbank and its clients to escape political risk. Moshkovich has agreed to buy 99 percent of the bank from main shareholder Shishkhanov and minorities, Binbank said. "They have agreed: one will sell, the other will buy," it said, adding that the deal was not yet complete and was subject to regulatory approval. Moshkovich is the owner of agricultural holding Rusagro and a senator in the Federation Council, Russia's upper house of parliament. Gutseriyev is the former head of mid-sized oil firm Russneft, which had its assets frozen last August in a tax probe. Binbank issued a statement in November saying it was in talks with a number of investors about selling a controlling stake. It said its capital stood at around 6.6 billion rubles ($268.9 million) as of November 1, 2007. (Reporting by Yelena Fabrichnaya; Writing by Robin Paxton; Editing by  Louise Ireland )
