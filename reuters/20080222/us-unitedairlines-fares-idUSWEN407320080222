 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - United Airlines UAUA.O said on Friday it raised fares on most U.S. domestic flights by up to $10 roundtrip to offset higher fuel costs. 

 "We must be able to pass commodity costs onto customers just like other industries do," said United spokeswoman Robin Urbanski. Most domestic routes are affected except markets were it competes head to head with low-cost carrier Southwest Airlines ( LUV.N ), she said. Oil prices hit record levels earlier this week.
