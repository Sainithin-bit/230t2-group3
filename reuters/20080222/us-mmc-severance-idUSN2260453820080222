 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Marsh & McLennan Cos Inc ( MMC.N ) will pay its former chief executive $7.15 million in severance pay, according to a regulatory filing on Friday. 

 MMC, which is one of the largest insurance brokers, said it will pay ex-CEO Michael Cherkasky a lump sum as part of a separation agreement. All unvested equity awards previously granted to Cherkasky -- who was forced out earlier this year after investors grew disgruntled with the company's poor financial performance -- will vest in full. But Cherkasky will not to be paid any bonus for 2007, according to MMC's filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. (Reporting by  Lilla Zuill )
