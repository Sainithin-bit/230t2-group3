 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Municipal bond issuers that have been burned by skyrocketing interest rates on their auction-rate securities are eyeing the extraordinary move of stepping into that market to buy back their own debt. 

 The Kansas Turnpike Authority put out a notice Thursday saying it was prepared to purchase bonds in the secondary market from any investor with liquidity concerns. "We will just buy back our auction-rate bonds at par and retire them," said Jon Glaser, the turnpike's chief financial officer. He said such a move would avoid the normal process of calling and redeeming bonds, which in the case of the turnpike would require a 30-day notice to investors. By reaching out directly to bondholders, Glaser said, the turnpike can quickly exit the auction-rate market, where a periodic auction on its debt failed February 15 and pushed the interest rate up to a maximum 6.616 percent. "We don't like paying that kind of interest rate," he said, adding the turnpike had enough cash on hand to take out the nearly $12.7 million of auction-rate bonds it sold in 2006. "To me that's rare. Not too many issuers can say they can take out their debt with cash," said Dick Larkin, a senior vice president and research director at Herbert J. Sims & Co. He said most muni issuers do not have that kind of accessible money so any trend of issuer-provided liquidity in the auction-rate market would be limited. BJC Health System, meanwhile, plans to bid on its own auction-rate bonds and refinance them at a later date, according to Kim Kitson, a spokeswoman for the St. Louis-based system, which has $243 million of outstanding bonds issued through the Missouri Health and Educational Facilities Authority in 2006. In a notice posted this week, BJC said while it has not experienced a failed auction, it planned to begin bidding on its own debt starting Tuesday using cash resources and "available borrowing capacity under short-term liquidity facilities." Many municipal issuers of auction-rate debt have or plan to get out of that troubled market, mostly by calling that debt and restructuring it to a variable-rate or fixed-rate mode. This new twist of issuer intervention in the market has caught the eye of a Securities and Exchange Commission official who has raised concerns about potential market manipulation. "Depending on all the facts and circumstances, an issuer bidding on its own bond could potentially violate rule 10b5 as market manipulation. Like all potential fraud violations, they have to be evaluated on all their own circumstances," said Martha Haines, director of the SEC's municipal securities office, adding that bond lawyers were seriously considering this option for issuers. Usually used in insider trading cases, rule 10b5 is the SEC's primarily tool for combating deceit or fraud connected to buying and selling securities. The meltdown of the auction-rate market was triggered by credit concerns over bond insurers that backed much of the debt, with some broker-dealers subsequently limiting or ending their support to keep the market liquid. Periodic auctions of the securities failed as buyers were scarce, forcing the debt to reset at highest allowable interest rates and leaving issuers with sticker shock. Tax-exempt and taxable municipals make up about half of the estimated $328 billion auction-rate market, according to Moody's Investors Service.
