 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. billionaire Ronald Perelman has gone to Florida's highest state court to overturn an appeals court ruling that stripped him of a $1.58 billion jury award against Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ). 

 The 2005 award stemmed from Perelman's accusations that the investment bank committed fraud in helping Sunbeam Corp. hide its shaky finances while arranging its $1.5 billion purchase of camping equipment maker Coleman Co. in 1998. Perelman received 14.1 million Sunbeam shares that became worthless after the appliance maker went bankrupt in 2001. A divided panel of the Florida Fourth District Court of Appeal in West Palm Beach vacated the award in March, saying Perelman failed to prove damages because he did not show what Sunbeam shares would have been worth had there been no fraud. In his appeal, filed on Thursday, Perelman said the majority erred in finding that he failed to prove damages, and in depriving him of a retrial where he could prove them. "Until this court reviews and quashes these rulings, Morgan Stanley (will) be relieved entirely of liability for the enormous damage it caused," Perelman's lawyer Joel Eaton wrote in papers seeking the Florida Supreme Court's review. Morgan Stanley spokesman Mark Lake said the investment bank intends to file a response within 20 days. "We are hopeful that the Florida Supreme Court will deny review of the Fourth District's decision," he said.
