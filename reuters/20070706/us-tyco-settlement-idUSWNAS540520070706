 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP will pay $225 million to settle a class-action case brought by investors in Tyco International Ltd. ( TYC.N ) following the accounting scandal at the diversified manufacturer, lawyers for the plaintiffs said on Friday. 

 The settlement with the auditing firm, combined with a recent settlement with Tyco that was previously announced, brings the total settlement to more than $3.2 billion, according to a statement from law firm Grant & Eisenhofer and two other law firms representing the plaintiffs. Pricewaterhouse could not immediately be reached for comment.
