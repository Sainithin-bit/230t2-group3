 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Genzyme Corp. GENZ.O said on Friday its experimental drug tolevamer, a treatment for diarrhea associated with the intestinal infection Clostridium difficile, worked no better than a standard antibiotic, sending the company's shares down more than 5 percent in early trading. 

 Results from the first of two late-stage, or Phase III, clinical trials, showed the drug was no more effective than the standard antibiotic vancomycin. The results represent a blow to Genzyme, one of the world's biggest biotechnology companies, as tolevamer had been considered one of the more promising drugs in its pipeline. "These are disappointing results that alter our expectations about the potential for commercializing tolevamer in the near future," said Henri Termeer, Genzyme's chief executive, in a statement. Tolevamer is designed to be the first non-antibiotic treatment for the condition, which is caused by a type of bacteria that can overgrow and cause infection in the intestine. The condition itself is often caused by taking antibiotics. Analysts at Cowen & Co. have projected peak sales for the drug of about $200 million if it showed success in preventing recurrences of the condition. This is the second time this week Genzyme has reported disappointing clinical trial results. On Thursday the company said one of its experimental treatments for pain associated with osteoarthritis of the knee worked no better than traditional steroids. And last month, the company reported mixed results for a powdered version of its experimental kidney disease drug, Renvela. The company's shares fell $3.37 to $61.50 in early trading on Nasdaq.
