 BERLIN  (Reuters) - Germany's Bundesrat Upper House of Parliament should have a considerable say on the euro zone's permanent rescue fund, German Chancellor Angela Merkel's chief of staff Ronald Pofalla said on Friday. 
 Pofalla told the Bundesrat it should have "considerable possibilities for contribution" to the discussion on shaping the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). (Reporting By Hans-Edzard Busemann)
