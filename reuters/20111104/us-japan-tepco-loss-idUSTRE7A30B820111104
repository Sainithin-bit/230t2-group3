 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's trade ministry said it expects Tokyo Electric Power Co (Tepco) will post a net loss of 576.3 billion yen ($7.4 billion) in the business year to next March, as it grapples with the clean-up of the crisis-hit Fukushima Daiichi plant. 
 Tepco secured 900 billion yen in assistance from a government-sponsored bailout body after the ministry approved on Friday a business restructuring by the utility, Japan's largest. (Reporting by Rie Ishiguro and Osamu Tsukimori; Editing by  Chris Gallagher  and Edmund Klamann)
