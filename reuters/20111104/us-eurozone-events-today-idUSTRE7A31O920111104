GREECE: POLITICS: -- Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou faces a cliff-hanger confidence vote on Friday after his plan for a referendum on an EU/IMF bailout backfired spectacularly. GOVERNMENT DEBT SUPPLY: -- Greece's debt agency needs to roll over a total of 3.6 billion euros of T-bills in November -- 2 billion euros of 6-month paper mature on November 11 and 1.6 billion in 3-month T-bills on November 18. -- November 4 - Debt agency sets amount of 6-month T-bills it will auction on November 8. ITALY: -- Italy, under fierce pressure from financial markets and European peers, has agreed to have the IMF and the EU monitor its progress with long delayed reforms of pensions, labor markets and privatization, senior EU sources said on Friday. -- After heavy pressure from France and Germany, the government promised additional measures including a rise in the pension age to 67 by 2026, a loosening of job protection and new rules allowing civil servants to be put on so-called Cassa Integrazione, mandatory stand down at minimum pay. -- Italian bonds have been hit by a new wave of selling this week as markets reeled from Greece's surprise decision to hold a referendum on its bailout package. -- Italy's President Giorgio Napolitano has stepped up pressure on Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, repeating demands for urgent reforms and indicating that he could consider options for an alternative government. POLITICS: November - Potentially sensitive political discussions on implementing the new reform measures promised by the government. Unions have already expressed strong opposition to weakening job protection measures. Relations within Berlusconi's center-right coalition already severely strained over pension reforms. DEBT ISSUES: November 10- Italian treasury to hold auction of short term bills (BOTs) November 14- Treasury to auction medium to long term debt GERMANY: POLITICS: -- The Free Democrats (FDP), junior coalition partner in Chancellor Angela Merkel's center-right government, will hold an internal vote in December to determine their party's stance on German contributions to European bailouts. [ID:nL5E7L4413] -- The FDP will hold a party congress in Frankfurt from November 12 to 13. The euro debt crisis will be a major theme. -- Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) will hold a party congress in Leipzig November 13 to 15, where the euro crisis will also be a major theme. -- At some point in the next week or two, either the Bundestag, lower house of parliament, or the parliaments budget committee will vote on the EFSF framework.

State and private investors injected 13.4 billion euros into the savings banks, known as cajas, at the end of the process, a fraction of that estimated by analysts. Spanish banks would need to raise 26 billion euros of capital by the end of Juneto shore up their balance sheets, EU politicians said end-October. Santander said its capital shortfall is 15 billion euros, or 6.5 billion after a convertible bond benefit. While peer BBVA needs 7.1 billion euros and Banco Popular needs 2.4 billion. GENERAL ELECTIONS FOUR MONTHS EARLY: -- Spain's Socialist Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, has brought forward general elections set for March 2012 to November 20, 2011. The conservative opposition Popular Party has a healthy poll lead. Spain has gone a long way with its austerity measures but its decision to shelve a partial sale of the state lottery suggests electoral politics are starting to impinge.
