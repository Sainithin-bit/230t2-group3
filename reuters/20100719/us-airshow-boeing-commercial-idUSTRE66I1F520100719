 FARNBOROUGH, England  (Reuters) - Boeing Co sees an "uneven recovery" in the global economy with the United States lagging, the chief executive of the company's commercial airplanes division said on Monday. 

 Speaking at the Farnborough Airshow outside London, Jim Albaugh said he was reasonably confident about the impact of the European sovereign debt crisis on the company's business. He also said he expected Boeing, the world's second-largest plane maker, to announce orders from airplane leasing companies this week. (Editing by Dan Lalor)
