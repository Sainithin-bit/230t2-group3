 SHANGHAI  (Reuters) - China's exports are expected to grow about 16.3 percent year-on-year in the second half, with full year growth estimated at around 24.5 percent, the China Securities Journal said on Monday, citing the country's State Information Center. 

 Imports are estimated to rise about 19.3 percent in the second half, with full year growth expected at around 33.6 percent, said the newspaper. China's trade surplus in June topped expectations on surprising strength in exports, rising 43.9 percent from a year earlier versus forecasts of a 38 percent rise. However, the State Information Center report said exports would be pressured by the impact of Europe's debt crisis as well as the culmination of a tax rebate earlier this year. Import growth is also expected to decline with internal demand falling, hitting an annual low in the fourth quarter, the newspaper cited the report as saying. China's economy cooled in the second quarter, a raft of economic data showed last week, with gross domestic product growth moderating to 10.3 percent from 11.9 percent in the first quarter.
