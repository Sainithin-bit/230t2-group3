 FARNBOROUGH, England  (Reuters) - U.S. planemaker Boeing Co said the aircraft leasing arm of General Electric Co would buy 40 of the company's 737-800 planes with a list value of $3 billion. 

 GE Capital Aviation Services already has more than 300 of the newer generation 737s in its fleet, Boeing said on Monday, with another 105 to be delivered to lessees. GECAS is one of a number of aircraft leasing companies to make major orders at the show, the aviation industry's largest gathering.
