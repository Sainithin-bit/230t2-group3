 FARNBOROUGH, England  (Reuters) - Pentagon acquisition chief Ashton Carter on Monday underscored his commitment to make U.S. weapons programs more affordable, singling out the Lockheed Martin Corp F-35 fighter as one program still in need of reforms. 

 Carter, speaking to reporters at the Farnborough Airshow, said he would issue 16 directives in early September aimed at implementing Defense Secretary Robert Gates's big drive to cut overheads across the U.S. military. Changes will affect the structure of contracts signed with defense contractors, reforms of existing programs, and greater attention to ensure any new programs are structured from the start to avoid cost increases later on, he said. Carter also said the Pentagon had "real" concerns about cost growth and performance on the Northrop Grumman Corp Global Hawk drone program. (Andrea Shalal-Esa in Farnborough; Editing by Dan Lalor)
