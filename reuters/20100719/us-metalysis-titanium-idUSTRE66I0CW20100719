 LONDON  (Reuters) - British technology company Metalysis is in talks with potential partners over a 70 million pound ($107.4 million) plan to build the world's first low-cost titanium plant, the Financial Times said on Monday. 

 "Assuming our plans work out, we could reduce the price of titanium by at least half, from $35,000 a metric ton to about $15,000 a metric ton," Metalysis' chief executive, Mark Bertolini, was quoted as saying by the paper. The company has discussed funding with collaborators including Rolls-Royce ( RR.L ) and Boeing ( BA.N ) and the U.S. aluminum producer Alcoa ( AA.N ), the paper said. "This is a very interesting development that a lot of people from around the world are getting excited about," the FT quoted a banker close to the talks as saying. The development could lead to a series of new applications for titanium in fields from car exhausts to golf clubs, the FT said, adding that a pilot plant should be ready by the end of the year. The company was not immediately available for comment. (Reporting by Karolina Tagaris; editing by Himani Sarkar)
