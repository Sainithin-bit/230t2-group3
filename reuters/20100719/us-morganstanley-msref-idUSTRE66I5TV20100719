 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) is considering ways to scale back its investment in its MSREF family of real estate funds, according to the Wall Street Journal. 

 Quoting people familiar with the matter, the Journal said Morgan Stanley might reduce its own capital in the funds or sell them. The people said planning is in the early stages and no decisions have been made. "We're not in discussions on the sale of the business," a Morgan Stanley spokeswoman told the Journal.
