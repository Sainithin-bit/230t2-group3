 FARNBOROUGH, England  (Reuters) - British airplane parts maker GKN has won contracts to make components for Rolls-Royce and General Electric aircraft engines and parts for Airbus' new 350 XWB plane. 

 Under a deal worth $300 million to GKN, the company will make tail bearings for Rolls' Trent 700 and 1000 model engines at its El Cajon facility in California until 2020. GKN also said it had signed a five-year deal worth $300 million with GE Aviation to supply aluminum and titanium components for a range of commercial and military aircraft engines. The company added that it won two contracts to make composite parts for the landing flaps of the wings for EADS-owned Airbus' new wide-body A350 XWB plane. GKN, which declined to give a value for the Airbus deal, said it would deliver the first components for the XWB's developmental flaps in early 2011.
