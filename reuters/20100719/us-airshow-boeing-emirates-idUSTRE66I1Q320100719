 FARNBOROUGH, England  (Reuters) - Boeing Co and Dubai's Emirates on Monday announced a deal for 30 of Boeing's 777-300 extended range planes, a deal worth potentially more than $9 billion. 

 The deal was unveiled at the start of the Farnborough Airshow, the aviation industry's largest gathering. Emirates made a similar splash last month at the Berlin Air Show with an $11 billion order from EADS for Airbus A380s. (Reporting by  Ben Berkowitz ; Editing by Dan Lalor)
