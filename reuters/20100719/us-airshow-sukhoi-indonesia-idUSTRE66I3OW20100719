 FARNBOROUGH  (Reuters) - Russian planemaker Sukhoi will sell 30 of its Superjet 100 aircraft to Indonesia's Kartika in a $951 million deal, the company said at the Farnborough airshow on Monday. 

 Sukhoi, which is making the passenger planes in partnership with Italy's Finmeccanica, said in a statement it would deliver the planes between 2012 and 2015. "This deal is a new chapter in the Sukhoi Superjet 100 program ... Our strategic goal (is) to take a solid position in the South East Asia market," the joint venture's president Vladimir Prisyazhnyuk said in a statement. Sukhoi, better known for its fighter jets, wants to deliver the first Superjet 100s to customers led by state airline Aeroflot by the end of the year, but the program has been dogged by delays. The company is owned by state-controlled United Aviation Corporation (UAC). The Superjet 100 will be the first passenger plane built by Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union, and will attempt to challenge market kings Airbus and Boeing in the regional carrier sector.
