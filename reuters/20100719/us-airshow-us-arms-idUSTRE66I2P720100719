 FARNBOROUGH, England  (Reuters) - U.S. arms sales for fiscal 2010 are likely to approach their target, which is slightly down from the sales level of fiscal 2009, the Pentagon's chief arms seller told Reuters in an interview. 

 Sales are expected to be close to $37.8 billion this fiscal year, down from $38.1 billion last fiscal year. Defense Security Cooperation Agency Director Jeffrey Wieringa had predicted in October that arms sales could reach $50 billion, exceeding the agency's official forecast, but that figure is more likely to be hit next year, he said on Monday. He also said a deal was near on the sale of fighter jets to Israel, specifically the first foreign military sale of the Lockheed Martin F-35 Joint Strike Fighter outside of the eight partner nations. "The ball is in their court," Wieringa said. "I am waiting for them to make a decision any day."
