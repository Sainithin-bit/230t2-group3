 FARNBOROUGH, England  (Reuters) - Bombardier still has no launch customer for the expected 2013 debut of its C-Series passenger plane but expects to get one, the president of its commercial aircraft unit said on Monday. 

 Gary Scott told reporters at the Farnborough Airshow that Bombardier was in advanced talks with a number of customers, which he forecast would lead to orders in the "not too distant future." "It is not taking any longer for the C-Series to get orders than it is taking for orders for any of the other airframe manufacturers," he said. The C100 line of the C-Series is due to enter service in 2013 and the C300 line in 2014. The plane is intended to compete in the single-aisle segment serving 100-149 passengers.
