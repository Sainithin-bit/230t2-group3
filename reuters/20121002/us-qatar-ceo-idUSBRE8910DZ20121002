 DOHA  (Reuters) - Qatar Airways backs the proposed $45 billion merger of EADS ( EAD.PA ) and BAE Systems ( BAES.L ), the Gulf carrier's chief executive said on Tuesday, arguing a combined entity would make better products. 
 Airbus parent EADS and BAE Systems are battling to save their tie-up, which would create a European aerospace and defense giant, amid competing government interests. "It will make them strong," Akbar Al-Baker said. "They're coming back together because staying apart was not in their best interest. They can provide better products and customer service together."
