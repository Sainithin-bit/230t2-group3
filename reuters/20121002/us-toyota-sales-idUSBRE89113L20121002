 (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ) said that September U.S. auto sales were the highest since March 2008, before the recent recession that cut deeply into new vehicle purchases. 
 Toyota, which showed a gain of 41.5 percent in September auto sales from the previous year, said the industry's September sales rate will be 14.9 million on a seasonally adjusted annualized basis. Toyota is No. 3 in the U.S. auto market in sales, behind leader General Motors Co ( GM.N ) and Ford Motor Co ( F.N ). In the 10 years prior to 2008, U.S. auto sales averaged nearly 17 million in new vehicle sales a year. (Reporting by  Bernie Woodall ; Editing by  Gary Hill )
