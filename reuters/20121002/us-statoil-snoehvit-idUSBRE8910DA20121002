 OSLO  (Reuters) - Norway's Statoil ( STL.OL ) will invest about 40 billion Norwegian crowns ($6.99 billion) in the upcoming development phases at its Snoehvit natural gas field in the Arctic to maintain production until 2040, a spokesman said on Tuesday. 
 Statoil said earlier on Tuesday it had dropped its plans to expand its Snoehvit field due to insufficient reserves. (Reporting by Henrik Stolen)
