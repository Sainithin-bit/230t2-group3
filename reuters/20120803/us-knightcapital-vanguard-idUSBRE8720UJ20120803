 (Reuters) - Vanguard Group, the largest U.S. mutual fund company which also runs a brokerage firm, said on Friday it is still not routing orders through Knight Capital Group Inc, a top market maker. 
 Vanguard first said it had stopped trading via Knight on Thursday after Knight suffered a trading glitch which wiped out $440 million of its capital. (Reporting By  Aaron Pressman ; Editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
