 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - American Airlines AMR.N and 
Continental Airlines Inc CAL.N have had exploratory talks 
about a merger, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday. 

  Citing people familiar with the situation, the report said 
it was not clear if the discussions would go any further. 
Continental has been in intensifying discussions with United 
Airlines UAUA.O about a possible tie up.  It is unclear if the latest development with American, 
reflects on prospects for UAL Corp's United and Continental.  Industry experts have also suggested American might want to 
pursue a smaller low-cost airline rather than a network rival.  The flurry of merger speculation comes as Northwest 
Airlines Corp NWA.N and Delta Air Lines Inc ( DAL.N ) near a 
possible merger proposal. Industry sources have said a deal 
could be announced as early as next week.  Continental has declined to comment on potential mergers. 
American officials could not be reached immediately for 
comment.  The shares of big U.S. airlines closed higher on Friday. 
American parent AMR Corp was up 44 cents, or 2.9 percent, to 
$15.25, while Continental finished up 99 cents, or 3.4 percent, 
at $29.69.  (Editing by  Andre Grenon )
