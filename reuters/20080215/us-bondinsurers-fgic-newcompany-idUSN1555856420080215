 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - FGIC Corp plans to move its municipal bond insurance business into a new company and leave its structured finance guarantee business in the existing company, a New York Insurance Department spokesman said on Friday. 

 The insurer, which has been stripped of its top ratings by all three major agencies, has told the New York Insurance Department that it plans to apply to set up a new insurer to house its muni bond business, spokesman David Neustadt said.
