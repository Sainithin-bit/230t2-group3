 LONDON  (Reuters) - Takeover talks between Brazilian mining group Vale ( VALE5.SA ) and target Xstrata XTA.L are floundering over price, sources close to the situation said on Friday. 

 Analysts say a takeover of Xstrata by Vale could cost more than $100 billion and would be the biggest acquisition ever by a Brazilian company. While all parties involved, including Xstrata's biggest shareholder Glencore, want a deal to take place, the two sides are far apart on price, the sources said. A problem has been the movements in the shares of the two firms since Vale said on January 21 that it was in talks about a possible takeover of Xstrata. Xstrata shares, down 1.1 percent at 38.10 pounds at 1500 GMT, have shot up 13 percent since then while Vale's stock is trading at around the same level. The share values are key since Vale would pay for more than half of the value of the deal with its stock, one source said. The two sides are far apart, with Vale seeing a price around 40 pounds as fair, but Glencore wanting 45-48 pounds, the sources said. Any deal would take at least a couple of weeks to consummate since other issues would needed to be thrashed out as well, they said. "I don't know if there is a deal," one of the sources said. Glencore, which holds a 35 percent stake in Xstrata, wants to have its supply agreements with Xstrata rolled over into the merged firm and later possibly expand them, the sources said. A deal by Vale, the world's largest iron ore producer, would be latest in a wave of large companies from emerging economies scooping up rivals in Europe and North America. In 2006, Vale bought Canada's Inco for $17 billion. A marriage of the two firms would diversify Vale from dependence on iron ore by boosting its presence in copper and nickel. The combined firm would be the world's largest nickel producer, surpassing Russia's Norilsk Nickel ( GMKN.RTS ). (Reporting by  Eric Onstad ; editing by Rory Channing)
