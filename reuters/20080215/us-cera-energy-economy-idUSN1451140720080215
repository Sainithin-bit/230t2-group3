 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told an energy conference on Thursday that high oil prices are harming the economy. 

 Greenspan also said that the economy does not face stagflation. "It's a burden now," Greenspan said. He added that it's "quite remarkable" that the economy is "able to do reasonably well" with oil prices near historic highs. Crude oil futures hit above $95 a barrel on Thursday and went above $100 in early January. (Reporting by  Anna Driver ; Editing by  Gary Hill )
