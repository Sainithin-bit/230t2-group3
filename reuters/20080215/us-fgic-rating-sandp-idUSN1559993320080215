 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Standard & Poor's on Friday said that a plan by bond insurer Financial Guaranty Insurance Co (FGIC) to split into two companies could disadvantage policy holders from its structured finance business, which includes risky mortgage backed debt. 

 FGIC, whose owners include private equity giant Blackstone Group LP ( BX.N ), plans to apply to create a new insurance company, into which it would move its municipal bond insurance operations, New York Insurance Department Spokesman David Neustadt said on Friday. The move is the latest step in the rescue of the U.S. bond insurance industry, which is expected to make billions of dollars of payouts in coming years after insuring bonds linked to subprime mortgage bonds and other risky debt. "We have been told that the newly licensed entity could facilitate the insurance of new public finance business and may also be the recipient of previously insured public finance business from FGIC," S&P said in a statement. "In our view it is possible that this process may result in the allocation of capital or other corporate resources in such a manner that other classes of policyholders may be disadvantaged," the rating agency said. S&P rates FGIC's insurance arm "AA," the third highest investment grade, and has the rating on "watch developing," indicating it could be raised, lowered or left unchanged.
