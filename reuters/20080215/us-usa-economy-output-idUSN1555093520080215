 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Industrial production rose 0.1 percent in January as expected and manufacturing output was unchanged, while manufacturing capacity utilization was at its lowest in almost a year, a Federal Reserve report showed on Friday. 

 Capacity utilization overall -- including at mines and utilities -- was 81.5 percent in January, matching the revised December level, and above the 35-year average of 81 percent. Analysts polled by Reuters were expecting capacity utilization to fall slightly to 81.3 percent from the previously reported 81.4 percent rate in December. But capacity use at factories dipped to 79.7 percent, the lowest since a 79.6 percent level in February 2007, and below the 35-year average for manufacturing capacity use of 79.8 percent. Lower output of motor vehicles and parts offset small output gains at factories elsewhere, including of computers and electronic products, the Fed said. Output at utilities climbed 2.2 percent. Mine production moved down 1.8 percent. (Reporting by  Mark Felsenthal ; Editing by  Neil Stempleman )
