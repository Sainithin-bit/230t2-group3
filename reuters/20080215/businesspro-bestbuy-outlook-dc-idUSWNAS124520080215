 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Best Buy Co Inc ( BBY.N ) cut its fiscal 
2008 profit outlook on Friday, blaming in part 
lower-than-expected sales growth in January. 

  The company now expects to earn $3.05 a share to $3.10 a 
share in fiscal 2008. Earlier, it had forecast earnings of 
$3.10 to $3.20.  Best Buy also forecast sales of about $40 billion for 
fiscal 2008, on same-store sales growth of 2.5 percent to 3 
percent. It had previously expected same-store sales to rise 
about 4 percent.  (Reporting by  Aarthi Sivaraman , editing by Gerald E.
