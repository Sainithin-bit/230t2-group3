 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Paul Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman and special adviser to U.S. President Barack Obama, sat down with Reuters correspondents  Caren Bohan  and  Kristina Cooke  for an interview on March 11. Following are excerpts from the interview. 

 WHY HE THINKS THE VOLCKER RULE IS NEEDED "I want to encourage a system where the banks that are at the core of the financial system still are strong and they are protected, they've been protected historically. They can go to the Federal Reserve for liquidity. They have deposit insurance (and) they have less formal means of protection because they are doing important services. I think that should continue. But I don't want to protect institutions that are engaged in essentially speculative activity and I don't want to see them mixed up, because once you mix them up, where do you stop protecting them?" WARNING ABOUT "MORAL HAZARD" "We are really, at the heart of it, trying to deal with this problem of moral hazard. The danger has been vastly increased by the reaction to the crisis where everybody was getting saved, to exaggerate a bit, whether they were banks, nonbanks, whether they were engaged in speculative activity or not. If they were big they got saved." "I think we ought to try to maintain a distinction between those we are going to protect -- and we may not protect them from failure either -- but at least they have some protection, and those that should be on their own feet, able to operate in a private market on their credit, not on the government's credit indirectly." IS HE OPTIMISTIC FINANCIAL REFORM WILL PASS THIS YEAR? "How do you define optimism? I still think it's probable we'll get some. But I don't think it's certain and it should be certain that we'd get some pretty comprehensive, sensible reform. "I'm not particularly interested personally in some legislation that passes because it's the only thing that can pass, because it isn't very constructive or helpful over a period of time. I'd like to see it get done and I'd like to see it get done right -- reasonably right." "I think the chances are still you'll get a sensible bill but I sure don't count it as certain." WHY HE ENDORSED OBAMA Volcker got to know Obama over a dinner with some Wall Street executives in June 2007 and later advised his campaign. "The only time I got involved in a presidential campaign -- but it didn't last very long -- I did support Bill Bradley ... He pulled out fairly early. But I've deliberately tried to avoid it. "(Obama's) personality is very calm, cool, collected, very knowledgeable, very sensible. I'd read a little bit of his books and so forth." "I think he's remarkably well-informed." "In meetings that I've been in with him, he never seems to be caught unawares of an issue. He seems to be on top of them all the time, which is quite unusual." ON HIS ROLE AS SPECIAL ADVISER TO OBAMA "I don't want to be inhibited in what I say, I've been inhibited all my life. It's time to be uninhibited." DOES HE SEE HIMSELF AS A POPULIST? "I've always been on the straight and narrow, the rest of it is all interpretation." WOULD A WEAKER VERSION OF THE VOLCKER RULE DO ANY GOOD? "If you just say 'If, in the judgment of a regulator, this is reaching a proportion that threatens the overall stability of the system, they will be authorized to do something,' ... If you just say that, nothing will happen. A regulator will never act on this until it's too late." COUNTERS CRITICS OF VOLCKER RULE "It's flat wrong, to say speculative activity was not part of the crisis." (Reporting by Caren Bohan and Kristina Cooke; Editing by  Claudia Parsons )
