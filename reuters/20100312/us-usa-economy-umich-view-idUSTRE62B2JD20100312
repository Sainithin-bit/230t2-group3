 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. consumer sentiment declined slightly in early March, with Americans less positive about the job outlook, a survey released on Friday showed. Business inventories in January were unchanged, according to the U.S. Commerce Department. 

 KEY POINTS: * The reading, however, stayed close to its six-month average, and was significantly above the year-ago level, according to Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's Surveys of Consumers. * The preliminary March reading for the surveys' overall index on consumer sentiment was 72.5, down from 73.6 where it ended in February, and below the 73.6 forecast by analysts polled by Reuters. * In early March, consumers were expecting no change in the national rate of unemployment, which stands at 9.7 percent, for the rest of 2010, and were losing confidence in help from government economic policies. The March reading was just a tad below the six-month average of 72, and up strongly from 57.3 in March 2009. COMMENTS: KEVIN FLANAGAN, CHIEF FIXED-INCOME STRATEGIST, MORGAN STANLEY SMITH BARNEY, PURCHASE, NEW YORK: "It's more important to watch what consumers do rather than what they say. Certainly there is a little different tone between the retail sales and the confidence figures. "The consumer is going to provide bottom line support for the economy but we need to see visible, meaningful improvement in the labor force before we can see the consumer get reengaged in a solid manner. "Treasuries are little changed to slightly better; just off the lows." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stock indexes were slightly weaker. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices held steady. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar fell against the yen but up on the euro.
