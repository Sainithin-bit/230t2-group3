 OSLO  (Reuters) - Norway's Yara International ( YAR.OL ) expects more consolidation in the fertilizer industry after seeing its opportunities in the United States limited by CF Industries ( CF.N ) outbidding it for Terra TRA.N, its CEO said. 

 Yara declined to raise its offer for Terra Industries on Friday to top a rival bid, boosting its shares and scuppering its U.S. expansion plans, at least for now. "The way we see it today, acquisition options have been limited somewhat, but you never know how things will develop," Chief Executive Joergen Ole Haslestad told Reuters on Friday. "Consolidation of the fertilizer industry worldwide is far from over," Haslestad said, adding that he expected CF to close the Terra acquisition. (Writing by Richard Solem)
