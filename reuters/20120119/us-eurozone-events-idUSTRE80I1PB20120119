GREECE: POLITICS: -- Talks between Greece and its creditors on a bond swap scheme, dubbed private sector involvement (PSI), have entered the final stretch. A deal must be clinched by next week to ensure there is enough time for the debt exchange to be wrapped up and funding by international lenders to be in place before a 14.5 billion euro government bond matures on March 20. -- IMF and EU inspectors in Athens continue high stake talks to flesh out a new bailout program that Greece needs to avert default. They will assess progress on reforms and reducing deficits versus targets set in a bailout program and whether a deal with private bondholders to cut the nation's debt burden will render it sustainable in the long term before freeing up further lending. GOVERNMENT DEBT SUPPLY: -- Athens is expected to continue monthly auctions of 3- and 6-month T-bills in February as it needs to refinance a total of 2.6 billion euros of maturing bills. Monthly T-bill sales are Greece's sole source of market funding. -- January 19 - Debt agency accepts additional non-competitive bids in 3-month T-bill auction. -- February 7 - Auction of 6-month T-bills. -- February 14 - Auction of 3-month T-bills.

The plans have sparked opposition and strikes from taxi drivers and other protests are planned. -- The deregulation plans follow an austerity program which includes the reintroduction of a housing tax, pension reform and spending cuts criticized by unions who say they spare the rich and are too tough on salaried workers, pensioners and vulnerable sections of society. -- Two relatively successful bond auctions brought Italy's 10-year bond yields below the psychologically important 7 percent mark and they are now hovering around 6.4 percent. POLITICS: -- Monti is heading to an EU finance ministers meeting on January 23 and a leaders' summit at the end of the month.

It has poured nearly 17 billion euros of state funds into its four remaining lenders, bringing the total amount of capital provided by the government to nearly 63 billion euros.
