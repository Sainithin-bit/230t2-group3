 (Reuters) - The Gulf Coast Claims Facility, created to compensate people and businesses for damages related to BP Plc's Gulf of Mexico oil spill, has paid $1.2 billion in claims since the organization took over the process from the oil company on August 23. 

 BP paid $400 million in claims before facility head Kenneth Feinberg began administering the $20 billion fund set up at the insistence of President Barack Obama. The April 20 well rupture killed 11 people and caused the world's worst marine crude oil spill. BP said it permanently sealed the well September 19. Below is a breakdown of payments made through Oct 11: Number of claims filed: Individual 114,427 Businesses 34,782 Total 149,209 Number of claims paid or approved for payment: 60,302 Individual $473.79 million Business $716.15 million Type of claims paid: Emergency advance payment $1.2 billion *Final claims: $0 Final claims under review 4,378 Number of claims denied: 132 Payments made to real estate brokers and agents as part of a separate fund: $34.5 million * No final claims have been paid because the Gulf Coast Claims Facility (GCCF) has reviews under way to determine whether claimants intended to file a final claim. After a final claim is paid, claimants give up their right to sue BP for more damages under the GCCF process.
