 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Republicans are headed for big gains in the Senate in the November 2 election and are threatening to take a majority, according to poll averages compiled by the website Real Clear Politics. 

 Republicans must sweep nearly all the competitive races to pick up the 10 seats needed for control in the Senate, where Democrats now hold a 59-41 edge. The poll averages show Republicans leading in races that would give them a net gain of nine seats, which would evenly split the chamber at 50-50. Democrats would retain control because Vice President Joe Biden is the tie-breaking vote. A Republican moved ahead in another state on Tuesday when Washington challenger Dino Rossi took a lead on incumbent Democrat Patty Murray of 1.7 percentage points. But Nevada flipped back to the Democratic column when Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid moved into a lead of less than 1 percentage point over Republican challenger Sharron Angle. In the House of Representatives, the Real Clear Politics averages show Republicans with a growing edge. Republicans lead with 211 seats to 185 for Democrats, with 39 contests considered toss-ups in the battle for a 218-seat majority. Republicans must pick up 39 Democratic seats to claim House control in November.
