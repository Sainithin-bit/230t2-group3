 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Activist hedge fund manager William Ackman on Tuesday sounded a bullish note on the U.S. economy, saying that improved corporate health may lay the groundwork for a new wave of acquisitions. 

 "I'm more bullish than I am bearish," Ackman, whose Pershing Square Capital Management oversees roughly $7 billion of assets, said at the Value Investing Congress. "I see a lot of reasons for economic improvement in this country," Ackman said, noting that corporations are now leaner and more efficient after the 2008 financial crisis. Ackman's fund firm tends to make most of its investments in the United States and on Friday Pershing Square unveiled a 16.5 percent stake in retailer J.C. Penney ( JCP.N ) and an 11 percent stake in Fortune Brands FO.N. While corporate balance sheets are strong and consumer balance sheets are improving, Ackman said, recovery may still be hobbled by a lack of confidence. Similarly, hedge fund manager Lee Ainslie said earlier that technology stocks are inexpensive and that companies have a lot cash on their balance sheets. "You have attractive investment opportunities, the only ingredient that's missing is confidence," he said. Ackman also sounded a slightly more optimistic note about the future of the U.S. economy by throwing cold water on buildings concerns that politicians in Washington will derail any recovery. "No matter happens in Washington, we'll be fine," Ackman said. In the run-up to the November 2 elections for federal and state officials, many investors have expressed concern about what might happen later. For Ackman, who has been a big supporter of prominent Democrats including Newark, New Jersey, Mayor Cory Booker and President Barack Obama, much of the uncertainty will evaporate next month, no matter which party prevails. "The key for me is reducing uncertainty and I think that happens after the election," he said. During the question and answer period at the Value Investing Congress, Ackman received a lot of questions about his latest investments. Know for his savvy in making real estate bets, Ackman said J.C. Penney has a "better real estate" portfolio than some of its competitors like Macy's Inc. ( M.N ). Pershing Square now owns roughly 39 million common shares J.C. Penney, according to a regulatory filing. (Additional reporting by  Emily Chasan ; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)
