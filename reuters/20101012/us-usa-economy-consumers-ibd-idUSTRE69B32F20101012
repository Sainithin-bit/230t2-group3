 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Consumer confidence rose 2.4 percent in October from September, buoyed by stock market gains and optimism that next month's elections will result in changed policy that may boost job creation. 

 Investor's Business Daily and TechnoMetrica Market Intelligence said their IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index rose to 46.4 in October from 45.3 in September. Readings above 50 indicate optimism, while those below 50 point to pessimism. The index is now 0.2 points below its 12-month average of 46.6, and 2.0 points above the 44.4 level IBD reported in December 2007 when the recession began. "Our data clearly show that, while disappointed with federal policies, Americans are looking forward to change in 2011 that will result in material improvement in their finances and in the economy," said Terry Jones, associate editor of Investor's Business Daily. "That could spell big trouble for incumbents on election night." Those surveyed were more upbeat about their household finances in the next six months. The gauge's personal financial outlook measure rose 0.6 percent in the month to 53.1. The index's six-month economic outlook component improved 12.2 percent to 49.6 and is now 17.5 points above its level in December 2007. The IBD/TIPP surveys more than 900 adults generally in the first week of the month. (Reporting by  Ciara Linnane ; Editing by  Padraic Cassidy )
