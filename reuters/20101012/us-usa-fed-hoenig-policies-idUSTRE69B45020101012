 DENVER  (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve must bear in mind the effects its actions have on other countries, even though its primary mission remains the health of the U.S. economy, Kansas City Federal Reserve President Thomas Hoenig said on Tuesday. 

 "We are not an island," Hoenig told the National Association of Business Economics. "We affect other countries, they know that and they react to us, and therefore we are affected by our actions as it comes back to us." Hoenig made the comments in response to a question from the audience. "We need to be mindful of that as we pursue policy," he said. "We affect, and we are affected: this is a global economy and we can't forget that."
