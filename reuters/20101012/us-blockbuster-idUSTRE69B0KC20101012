 BANGALORE  (Reuters) - Video rental chain Blockbuster Inc has launched a search for a new chief executive, in a move that could see CEO Jim Keyes replaced before the end of the year, the Wall Street Journal said, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. 

 The Dallas-based retailer, which has been battered by online and mail-order services, last month filed for bankruptcy protection, throwing the future of potentially hundreds of its stores in doubt. The company has agreed to hire an executive-search firm to look at new blood to run it once the company emerges from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, the newspaper reported. The search is in its earliest stages, and Keyes, who has led Blockbuster since 2007, remains a candidate to continue leading the company, the Journal said. Blockbuster could not immediately be reached for comment by Reuters outside of regular U.S. business hours. (Reporting by Anand Basu in Bangalore; Editing by Dhara Ranasinghe)
