 (Reuters) - Freddie Mac ( FMCC.OB ), the No. 2 U.S. home funding company, said on Tuesday it plans to sell $2 billion of bills later on Tuesday. 
 The sale will include $1 billion of three-month bills due August 27, 2012, and $1 billion of six-month bills due November 26, 2012. The bills will be sold over the Internet in a Dutch auction. In such uniform price auctions, successful bidders pay only the price of the lowest accepted bid rather than the actual price as in a conventional multiple-price auction. Bids will be accepted from authorized dealers until 9:45 a.m. EDT (1345 GMT). Settlement is May 30. (Reporting by Pam Niimi Editing by W Simon)
