 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The dollar briefly slipped against the yen on Tuesday after data showed U.S. consumer confidence unexpectedly fell to its lowest level in four months. 
 The dollar fell as low as 79.37 yen, before rebounding to trade at 79.45 yen, little changed on the day. (Editing by  James Dalgleish )
