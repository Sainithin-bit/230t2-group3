 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. government debt prices held steady at higher levels early Tuesday after U.S. home price data for March from S&P/Case-Shiller came within market expectations, suggesting some stabilization in the struggling real estate market. 
 Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes last traded up 6/32 in price, yielding 1.73 percent, down 2 basis points from late on Friday. U.S. financial markets were closed on Monday for the Memorial Day holiday. (Reporting by  Richard Leong ; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
