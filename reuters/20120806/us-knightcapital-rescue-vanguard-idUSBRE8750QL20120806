 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Vanguard Group has begun rerouting "a portion of their orders" to Knight Capital Group Inc ( KCG.N ) after the announcement of a deal to rescue Knight, a Vanguard spokesman said on Monday. 
 Knight announced earlier on Monday that a group of investors rescued the firm in a $400 million deal that keeps the company in business. Blackstone Group LP BX.N, Getco and financial services companies TD Ameritrade Holding Corp ( AMTD.N ), Stifel Nicolas ( SF.N ), Jefferies Group Inc JEF.N and Stephens Inc purchased preferred shares convertible at $1.50 each for a 73 percent stake in the company, Knight said in a statement just before market open. Knight's problems started early last Wednesday when a software glitch flooded the New York Stock Exchange with unintended orders for dozens of stocks, boosting some shares by more than 100 percent and leaving the company with a $440 million trading loss. As a result, a number of firms, including Vanguard, Fidelity Investments, TD Ameritrade and Scottrade stopped routing orders through Knight. But by Friday, TD Ameritrade and Scottrade resumed routing orders to Knight. A Fidelity spokeswoman declined to comment on whether the firm had begun rerouting trades through Knight. Knight shares traded at $3.07, down 98 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting By Jessica Toonkel; Editing by Gerald E. McCormick and Dan Grebler)
