 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Knight Capital Group Inc Chief Executive Thomas Joyce said on Monday the group of investors that injected $400 million into the firm over the weekend to keep it afloat after a massive trading error last week fully supports his leadership and his management team. 
 Joyce said in an interview that he does not believe any market rules were broken when a software glitch caused Knight to make thousands of unintended trades on about 140 stocks on Wednesday, distorting the market and leading to a $440 million loss at the firm.
