 ZURICH  (Reuters) - UBS ( UBSN.VX ) will continue to revamp its investment bank, the head of the unit said, pointing to the possibility that more divisions could be sold or shut down, as UBS aims to do with its municipal bond unit. 

 "We will make further strategic decisions of this nature pending our strategic review," said Jerker Johansson on a phone call with analysts on Tuesday.
