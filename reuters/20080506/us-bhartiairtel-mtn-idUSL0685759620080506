 JOHANNESBURG/NEW DELHI  (Reuters) - Shares in South African telecoms operator MTN ( MTNJ.J ) soared on Tuesday on news that Bharti Airtel ( BRTI.BO ) was considering a takeover, but shares in the Indian group sagged amid concerns over funding. 

 Bharti and MTN Group said on Monday they were in talks which may or may not lead to a deal. Singapore Telecommunications (SingTel) ( STEL.SI ), which owns over 30 percent of Bharti, also confirmed on Tuesday that Bharti was in talks with MTN. The Financial Times newspaper, quoting unnamed sources, said Bharti -- India's top mobile operator -- had bid for 51 percent of MTN. It said Bharti had secured $12 billion from banks to fund the deal. But Bharti said in a statement it had not made any offer to buy the whole or part of MTN. "Therefore, the speculation around a bid by Bharti in a section of the media is incorrect and misleading," it said. MTN also declined to comment on the FT report. "I can't confirm that (bid)," MTN spokeswoman Pearl Majola told Reuters. MTN has a market value of about $36 billion, and at end-March had 68.2 million subscribers in 21 countries in Africa and the Middle East. Bharti is valued at about $42 billion and has 62 million subscribers. Jan Mentjes, portfolio manager at Gryphon Asset Management, said a majority stake purchase by Bharti would affect shareholders' returns. "If it was an outright purchase, shareholders will have to be compensated with parting with expected growth," he said. "I don't think MTN shareholders are looking for an exit." SHARE REACTION MTN shares jumped 10 percent early on Tuesday on the takeover news and closed 6.67 percent higher at 160 rand. "It's because of the continued market speculation, which is pushing the MTN share price up," a telecoms analyst said. Ian Liddle, chief investment officer at Allan Gray Equity Fund in Johannesburg, said MTN is an attractive asset and people would be interested in buying it. Ashraf El Ansary, global emerging market portfolio manager at JP Morgan in London, said: "Both of them are big players in the sector, so one reason would be to diversify their income outside their home market. "The other is to build more scale, which will enable them to create some operational synergies ... in the long term." But Bharti shares fell as much as 6 percent amid concern about how it may fund the deal, before ending down 5.3 percent at 846.60 rupees, their lowest close since April 24. "It's a very bold move, an audacious move," said Harit Shah, telecoms analyst at Mumbai-based Angel Broking. "No doubt MTN will give them a global footprint, but it may not be good for shareholders as China Mobile and Vodafone are reported to be also interested in MTN ... and they may end up in a bidding war." The Financial Times said Britain's Vodafone Group ( VOD.L ), China Mobile ( 0941.HK ) and India's Reliance Communications ( RLCM.BO ) were also likely to be interested in MTN. Citigroup analysts said Bharti could be partnered by SingTel if it goes ahead with a bid for MTN. "Given the size of any potential acquisition, we see a reasonable probability that SingTel gets directly involved with Bharti as a co-buyer as well," Citigroup analysts said in a report. MTN stakeholders include Public Investment Corporation, Lombard Odier Darier Hentsch and Cie, JP Morgan Chase and Old Mutual Group.
