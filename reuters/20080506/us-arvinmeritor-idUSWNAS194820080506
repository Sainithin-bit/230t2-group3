 DETROIT  (Reuters) - ArvinMeritor Inc ARM.N said on Tuesday it plans to spin off its automotive parts business from its larger trucking group in a move it hopes will improve the focus of each unit, sending its shares up 6 percent. 

 The truck business, with $4.2 billion per year of sales, will continue to be called ArvinMeritor under the plan, which calls for a 100 percent spin-off of the $2.2 billion-per-year car parts business to shareholders under the name Arvin Innovation Inc. The planned split comes eight years after Arvin and Meritor merged to form an auto and truck parts supplier with annual sales of $7.5 billion to broaden its focus and better compete in what was a consolidating industry. ArvinMeritor hopes to complete the split within a year. The plan does not require shareholder approval, though it needs certain tax rulings and regulatory approvals, it said. It will provide more financial details on the proposal later in May. "In the end, we will have two multibillion-dollar companies that are market-leading companies ... with stronger competitive positions because there will be clarity and a focus in the businesses," ArvinMeritor Chief Executive Chip McClure said. ArvinMeritor's board approved the plan to go forward with a spin-off on Monday. The company also needs approval from unions in North America and Europe, though unions represent a relatively small share of its workers worldwide. McClure said in an interview that the decision on the split was a culmination of ArvinMeritor's three-year restructuring in which it closed unprofitable plants and shed its emissions unit, replacement auto parts business and other operations. ArvinMeritor, like other U.S. vehicle parts suppliers, has been contending with production cuts by U.S.-based automakers and rising costs for raw materials such as steel, as well as the cyclical downturn in the North American truck market. EVALUATED VARIOUS OPTIONS Still, the company reported a fiscal second-quarter profit in April and affirmed its full-year earnings forecast, supported by operations outside the United States. ArvinMeritor's management and board considered different scenarios for the auto parts business and chose a spin-off after finding "there is really more value as a whole than in pieces," McClure said in a conference call. Bear Stearns analyst Peter Nesvold said the formal separation made sense, "though the precise structure supports our prior view that there was neither a strategic nor a financial acquirer interested in all of (the auto business) at a reasonable price." Fitch placed ArvinMeritor on ratings watch negative, saying the spinoff increased exposure for the commercial vehicle company to the cyclical truck market and the car parts company to competition in the auto parts sector. The ratings agency said the multiyear restructuring has begun to have a positive impact on ArvinMeritor results, but margins in the auto parts unit remain at low levels and duplicating corporate functions at the new business will also pressure margins. ArvinMeritor's current management will be divided between the two companies. McClure, who is also ArvinMeritor's chairman and president, will retain those positions. Carsten Reinhardt, president of the commercial vehicle business, will become chief operating officer of ArvinMeritor after the spin-off. Jay Craig, senior vice president and controller, has been named chief financial officer of ArvinMeritor, succeeding James Donlon, who has become acting CFO of the car parts business. Phil Martens, president of the car parts unit, will become president and CEO of Arvin Innovation and Donlon will become executive vice president and CFO upon the spin-off. "We have the right management in place on both sides," McClure said, calling Marten's a "car guy" and Reinhardt a "truck guy." ArvinMeritor will remain headquartered in Troy, Michigan, and Arvin Innovation will establish a headquarters in Detroit. The light vehicle business has about 9,000 employees and 42 facilities in 16 countries, providing roof and door assemblies, electronic controls, suspension and ride control products. About 20 percent of the car parts business sales are to the U.S.-based automakers in North America. Chrysler LLC CBS.UL, General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) and Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) account for about 30 percent of the unit's sales worldwide. ArvinMeritor expects its car parts business to have revenue of about $2.4 billion in 2008, growing to a range of $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion in 2010. The heavy truck business has about 10,000 employees at 62 locations in 15 countries, producing axles and drivelines, brakes, suspensions and other parts for trucks, trailers, buses, military vehicles and off-highway vehicles.

ArvinMeritor shares were up $1, or 6.3 percent, to $16.79 in Tuesday afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by David Bailey; Editing by Dave Zimmerman and  Tim Dobbyn )
