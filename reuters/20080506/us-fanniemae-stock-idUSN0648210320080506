 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Fannie Mae shares shed earlier losses to turn higher on  Tuesday as investors found comments from executives on a conference call reassuring, traders said. 

 Fannie Mae shares moved 2.5 percent higher to $29 in late-morning trading. They started the day sharply lower after Fannie posted its third straight quarterly loss and said it would cut its dividend and raise $6 billion in fresh capital to weather the U.S. housing market downturn. "Whatever comments they're making are making people more comfortable," said Bobby Harrington, head of block trading at UBS. On the conference call, Fannie Chief Executive Daniel Mudd said the mortgage finance company was "staunching bleeding" in its derivatives portfolio. (Editing by Gary Crosse)
