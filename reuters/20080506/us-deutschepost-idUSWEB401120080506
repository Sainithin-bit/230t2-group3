 COLOGNE, Germany  (Reuters) - German mail and logistics group Deutsche Post ( DPWGn.DE ) named Ken Allen as the new head of its loss-making DHL Express business in the United States as the company seeks to turn it around. 

 "The group has consistently narrowed down its options to substantially improve the performance of its Express Americas business and will announce a plan for the business by the end of May," Post said in a statement at its annual shareholder meeting on Tuesday. "The U.S. market remains a firm pillar of the express business' global strategy." Deutsche Post confirmed its forecast for earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) before non-recurring effects of around 4.2 billion euros ($6.49 billion) for 2008 and pretax profit of around 3.2 billion euros. The company was also still aiming for EBIT of 4.7 billion euros in 2009.
