 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Adidas's ADSG.DE first-quarter net income climbed by a third as sales of the German sports good maker's Adidas and TaylorMade brands grew strongly but weakness at Reebok continued in the United States. 

 Adidas said on Tuesday net income rose 32 percent to 169 million euros ($261.1 million) and sales climbed 3 percent on a currency-adjusted basis to 2.621 billion euros. Thirteen analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast, on average, net income of 157 million euros and sales of 2.624 billion. (Reporting by Rajiv Sekhri)
