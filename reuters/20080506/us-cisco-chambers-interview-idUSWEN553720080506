 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc ( CSCO.O ) Chief Executive John Chambers said on Tuesday that most of his customers see recent weakness in business conditions as a short-term trend and expect a recovery by the end of the year. 

 "In terms of what we're hearing from our customers, most of them believe that this will be a relatively short-term phenomenon," Chambers told Reuters in an interview after announcing the company's third-quarter results. "Most of my customers believe their business will be coming back up by the end of the year and therefore spending that is tied to their economic scenario should pick back up as well."
