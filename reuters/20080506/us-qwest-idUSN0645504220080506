 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Telephone company Qwest Communications International Inc ( Q.N ) reported a 34.6 percent fall in quarterly earnings on Tuesday, hurt by increased tax expense, charges for job cuts and weakness in its long-distance phone business. 

 Qwest, seen as one of the weakest former Bell operating companies, is challenged by the lack of a mobile service unit and the costs of operating a vastly rural territory. The company had said it was unhappy with its arrangement to resell Sprint Nextel Corp's ( S.N ) wireless services, and on Monday announced a five-year agreement to resell Verizon Wireless's mobile service, beginning this summer. Verizon Wireless is a joint venture of Verizon Communications Inc ( VZ.N ) and Vodafone Group Plc ( VOD.L ). Qwest said first-quarter net profit fell to $157 million, or 9 cents a share, reflecting a significantly higher income tax expense of $99 million calculated at normal effective rate compared with the year-ago period tax expense of $2 million. Revenue fell 1.4 percent to $3.4 billion, in line with Wall Street expectations. The company said results reflect the impact of industry consolidation and long-distance pricing pressure in wholesale markets. Qwest took $45 million in severance charges, mostly related to a plan to reduce its work force by 720 people through a voluntary separation plan for some employees supporting its traditional telephone business. Excluding that charge, earnings per share in the quarter were 10 cents, matching the average analyst forecast, according to Reuters Estimates. Qwest, Which has seen shares fall around 40 percent over the past year, has relied on cost cuts and Internet subscriptions to buffer the impact of a decline in traditional phone users. In the first quarter, total access lines fell 7.8 percent to 12.5 million. Broadband subscribers grew by 90,000 to 2.7 million, up 17 percent from a year earlier. Qwest shares fell about 4 percent in premarket trading. (Reporting by  Tiffany Wu ; Editing by Gerald E. McCormick and Maureen Bavdek)
