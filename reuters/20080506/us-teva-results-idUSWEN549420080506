 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd TEVA.O ( TEVA.TA ), the world's largest generic drugmaker, on Tuesday reported a drop in its first-quarter net profit, weighed by a charge tied to its acquisition of CoGenesys. 

 Quarterly net income at the Israel-based company was $147 million, or 18 cents per share, compared with $342 million or 42 cents per share a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the CoGenesys charge, Teva said it earned 64 cents a share in the quarter. Sales rose 24 percent to $2.57 billion. (Reporting by  Aarthi Sivaraman )
