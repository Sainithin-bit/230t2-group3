 SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - U.S. asset manager BlackRock Inc ( BLK.N ) is to buy a portfolio of subprime mortgage debt from UBS AG ( UBSN.VX ) for $15 billion, the Financial Times reported on its website on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the transaction. 

 The FT said the deal was due to be announced on Tuesday along with first-quarter results from UBS. It said the debt would be bought by BlackRock at a 25 percent discount to its face value of $20 billion and then placed in a new fund that would be marketed to investors. UBS would hold a minority interest in the fund, which would enable it to participate in any gains. The FT said UBS declined to comment. (Writing by  Alan Raybould , Editing by Ian Geoghegan)
