 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Cosmetics maker Estee Lauder Cos Inc ( EL.N ) on Tuesday reported lower quarterly profit, hurt by a soft U.S. retail environment and weakness in its fragrance and hair-care businesses. 

 The company, known for its Aveda, Clinique and Bobbi Brown brands, said profit was $90.1 million, or 46 cents per share, for its fiscal third quarter that ended March 31, compared with $93.9 million, or 45 cents per share, a year earlier. The company had fewer shares outstanding in the latest quarter, which boosted per-share results. Analysts, on average, were expecting earnings of 47 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 11 percent to $1.88 billion from $1.69 billion. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, it said net sales rose 7 percent. Sales in its Europe, Middle East and Africa regions rose 17 percent, while sales in its Asia Pacific region increased 26 percent. U.S. sales in the quarter rose 2.8 percent. It said the operating loss in its fragrance business widened, hurt by lower results from designer fragrances. It also said its hair-care operating results declined, due in part to soft sales growth. Last week, rival Elizabeth Arden Inc ( RDEN.O ) reported a surprising quarterly net loss and cut its full-year outlook as the weak economy crimped cosmetic sales. But Estee Lauder said it now sees full-year earnings per share of $2.34 and $2.40. In February, it said it expected fiscal 2008 earnings of $2.28 to $2.40 a share.
