 ZURICH  (Reuters) - Swiss bank UBS AG ( UBSN.VX ) does not see any need to find a merger partner and believes that its performance so far this year proves it is able to deal with its challenges alone, its chief executive said on Tuesday. 

 "The first quarter has demonstrated that we can address tough challenges on our own and with the support of our shareholders," said Marcel Rohner.
