 PHILADELPHIA  (Reuters) - Tishman Speyer Properties and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. are close to a deal to acquire real estate investment trust Archstone-Smith Trust, according to the online edition of The Wall Street Journal on Monday. 

 The total value of the deal could top $20 billion, including debt, the report said. Lehman, Tishman and Archstone-Smith could not be immediately reached for comment. Archstone-Smith has a market capitalization of about $12.3 billion. Its stock trades at about 24 times Wall Street's earnings estimates for 2007, above the sector average of 18.4 times earnings. An acquisition of Archstone-Smith would be the latest in a wave of mergers in the real estate sector. Earlier this year, Blackstone Group acquired Equity Office Properties Trust for $23 billion. Archstone-Smith owns apartments in lucrative markets such as Boston, New York, Southern California, San Francisco and Washington, D.C. As of March 31, Archstone-Smith owned or had an ownership stake in 344 communities with 86,014 apartments. Shares of Archstone rose about 8 percent on Friday after reports that Tishman and Archstone were in discussions about a transaction, the report said. Archstone closed at $55.23, up $4.10, on Friday. The U.S. financial markets were closed on Monday for the Memorial Day holiday.
