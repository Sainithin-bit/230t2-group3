 MELBOURNE/SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Shares in Australia's Coles Group Ltd. CGJ.AX fell as much as 4 percent on Tuesday after private equity group Kohlberg Kravis Roberts KKR.UL pulled out of a consortium planning to bid for the retailer. 

 Shares in rival bidder Wesfarmers Ltd WES.AX rose as KKR's withdrawal increased its chances of securing Australia's second-largest supermarket chain, analysts said. Wesfarmers has already offered A$19.7 billion ($16.2 billion) for Coles, or A$16.47 per share, and amassed a 12.8 percent voting stake. But Coles wants to run a competitive auction. KKR, which has pursued Coles for nearly 10 months, said late on Monday it had abandoned its latest attempt because of concerns about the health of some of the retailer's businesses after looking at its books, just hours after partner CVC CVC.UL pulled out. "It clearly weakens the position of the private equity consortium, and it should enhance Wesfarmers' position," said CommSec analyst Grant Saligari. "They are valuable assets, but everything has a price, and there needs to be an assessment of the downside risks as well. While there is tremendous upside in turning around the supermarkets, everything might not go to plan," Saligari said. Coles shares were trading 4.1 percent weaker at A$16.67 at 0415 GMT, while Wesfarmers was up 0.5 percent at A$37.99. A Wesfarmers spokesman said the conglomerate and its private equity partners remain "very committed" to the sale process and the due diligence process was going smoothly. "Wesfarmers is very focused on delivering Coles shareholders a proposal as quickly as possible," the spokesman said. KKR has been pursuing the troubled retailer since August last year. It made two offers for Coles last year that were rejected by the board as being too low. MORE CHANGES POSSIBLE Four partners remain in the group that was led by KKR: Bain, Blackstone Group BG.UL, Carlyle Group CYL.UL and TPG TPG.UL. A spokesman for the consortium said the bid group was still alive but could not rule out further changes. Rival retailer Woolworths Ltd. ( WOW.AX ) is also eyeing some Coles assets but has not yet decided whether to team up with the private-equity group, sources have said. The departure of KKR "reduces some of the bidding tension in the auction, and you could read more into it in terms of the state of Coles' assets," said White Funds investment manager Atul Lele. A source familiar with the situation said they would not be surprised if more members of the consortium dropped out, but it was unclear when this could happen. However, each individual buyout firm had the financial firepower to go it alone, the source said. TPG is now seen as playing a leadership role in the bid group. Wesfarmers started due diligence on May 25 and will attend management presentations on Tuesday on the core food and liquor business. The Wesfarmers spokesman said the defections from the rival consortium reflected the high hurdles to beat its own bid. "We see it as a recognition of the hurdle faced by foreign private equity in seeking to offer cash to retail and institutional shareholders in competition with listed Australian scrip paying fully franked dividends," he said. Because investors who accept shares can get capital gains tax relief, Wesfarmers is seen as having an advantage of more than A$1 a share over a straight cash bid. The Australian conglomerate has teamed up with Macquarie Bank Ltd. MBL.AX and private equity groups Permira and Pacific Equity Partners. Coles has asked for final, binding bids in the week beginning June 25. ($1=A$1.22)
