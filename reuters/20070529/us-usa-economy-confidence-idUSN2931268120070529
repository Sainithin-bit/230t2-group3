 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence rose more sharply than expected in May as a more upbeat business outlook and a surging stock market overshadowed the impact of record gasoline prices, a survey showed on Tuesday. 

 The Conference Board said its index of consumer sentiment climbed to 108.0 in May versus April's upwardly adjusted 106.3. The median forecast of economists polled by Reuters was for 105.0, seen rebounding from an originally reported 104 in April, which was the lowest reading since August. "All in all, confidence levels continue to suggest growth, albeit at a slow pace," Lynn Franco, the Conference Board's director of research said in a statement. However, record gasoline prices have fanned consumers' inflation worries, pushing the report's inflation gauge to its highest level in a year. "The short-term outlook remains cautious, and rising gasoline prices are having a negative impact on consumers' inflation expectations," Franco said. U.S. stocks added to earlier gains after the confidence data suggested that consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of the economy, would hold steady despite rising fuel costs and a weak housing market. Bond prices fell as prospects of moderate growth would leave little room for the Federal Reserve to trim interest rates with inflation expectations on the rise. Consumers' expectations for the inflation rate for the next 12 months were 5.5 percent in May versus a downwardly revised 5.1 percent in April and 5.6 percent a year ago. Consumers' views of current and future conditions improved in May from April. The business research group's present situation index rose to 136.1 in May from an upwardly revised 133.5 in April, while its expectations index increased to 89.2 in May from an upwardly adjusted 88.2 in April. Consumers' assessment of the job market did not change much, the Conference Board said. Consumers surveyed who said jobs were "plentiful" held a revised 29.0 percent in May versus April. Those who said jobs were "hard to get" slipped to 19.9 percent in May from a downwardly adjusted 20.3 percent in April. The government will release its May nonfarm payroll report at 8:30 a.m. on Friday. Economists surveyed by Reuters expect that employers likely added 130,000 jobs in May, up from April's 88,000 increase.
