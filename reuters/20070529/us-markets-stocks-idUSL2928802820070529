 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended higher on Tuesday, helped by a wave of takeover news involving tech companies such as Avaya Inc. ( AV.N ), but China's move to cool off its skyrocketing stock market limited Wall Street's broader advance and raised concern about a global equity sell-off. 

 A slide in shares of energy companies, including Exxon Mobil Corp. ( XOM.N ), weighed on the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 in light post-holiday trading as U.S. oil prices dropped about $2 a barrel. The Chinese government's move, announced late in the U.S. trading session, put investors on edge and contributed to a choppy session despite optimism about stock valuations in the tech sector. "The concern is that China may be acknowledging that their markets are overheated by the action they've taken today," said Michael James, senior trader at regional investment bank Wedbush Morgan in Los Angeles. "Any little ripple like this is grounds for the (U.S.) market to sell off." The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  edged up 14.06 points, or 0.10 percent, to end at 13,521.34. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  inched up 2.38 points, or 0.16 percent, to close at 1,518.11. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  rose 14.87 points, or 0.58 percent, to finish at 2,572.06. A slide in Chinese equities in late February set off a sell-off in stock markets around the world. Since then, Wall Street has surged on a wave of takeovers and share buybacks. Last week, the S&P 500 even flirted with closing at a fresh record On Tuesday, Wall Street's first day back at work after the Memorial Day holiday, volume was about 20 percent lighter than normal on the New York Stock Exchange. U.S. markets were closed on Monday for the Memorial Day holiday. Talk of more takeover deals lifted all three major stock indexes at Tuesday's opening bell. Stocks extended those gains after a stronger-than-expected reading on consumer confidence in May from The Conference Board, a private research group. A RUMBLE FROM CHINA But the Dow turned negative around midday as falling oil prices prompted investors to sell energy stocks and then extended losses in early afternoon trading, following the news from China. In a midnight announcement through the  official Xinhua news agency, China's Ministry of Finance said stock trading stamp duty has been raised to 0.3 percent starting on Wednesday from the current 0.1 percent. The unusual move underlined the Chinese government's deep concern following a 62 percent rise in Shanghai's benchmark stock index .SSEC , so far this year -- on top of a 130 percent jump last year. Last Wednesday, former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan rattled stock investors when he warned that he feared a "dramatic contraction" in China's stock market. AN APPETITE FOR TECH Avaya Inc. ( AV.N ) was among the top percentage gainers on the New York Stock Exchange in Tuesday's session. Avaya's stock shot up 15.3 percent to $15.76 after the Wall Street Journal reported that the telecommunications equipment maker was in talks with private equity and strategic bidders about selling all or part of the company.

The stock jumped nearly 10 percent to $83.11 after the Wall Street Journal reported that the computer technology retailer may be a takeover target of private equity firms. <ID:nN29297461> Shares of International Business Machines Corp. ( IBM.N ) ended up 0.7 percent at $105.91 on the NYSE after Barron's, the weekly financial newspaper, reported that the stock could easily top $120, citing the company's forecast for higher profits due to software sales, stock buybacks, and growth in emerging markets. IBM was the Dow's biggest advancer, while Exxon was the top-weighted decliner in both the Dow and the S&P 500. Exxon's stock fell 1.1 percent to $82.62 after dropping in sync with crude oil prices as threats to Nigerian output eased and more U.S. refinery units resumed production. U.S. crude oil for July delivery CLN7 fell $2.05 to settle at $63.15 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Trading was light on the NYSE, with about 1.42 billion shares changing hands, below last year's estimated daily average of 1.84 billion. On the Nasdaq, about 1.73 billion shares traded, below last year's daily average of 2.02 billion. Advancing stocks outnumbered declining ones by a ratio of about 7 to 4 on the NYSE and by about 5 to 3 the Nasdaq.
