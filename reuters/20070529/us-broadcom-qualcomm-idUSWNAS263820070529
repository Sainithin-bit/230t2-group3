 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A federal jury found Qualcomm Inc. ( QCOM.O ) guilty of infringing three patents owned by smaller rival Broadcom Corp. ( BRCM.O ) and it awarded Broadcom $19.6 million in damages on Tuesday, the companies said. 

 Wireless chip and technology license supplier Qualcomm said it would file post-trial motions to overturn the verdict, and, if unsuccessful, it would appeal the case. Qualcomm noted that the damages award could be increased by up to threefold for willful infringement, which would be determined by the trial judge. Broadcom said it planned to ask the  U.S. District Court for the Central District of California in Santa Ana to issue a permanent injunction barring Qualcomm from further infringement of the wireless technology patents. The court set a June 18 hearing date to schedule post-trial motions, Qualcomm said. If the judge upholds the jury verdict Qualcomm plans to appeal the case, the company said. One of the patents in the case relates to wireless video processing, while another relates to how calls are handed over to networks with different technologies, and the third relates to walkie-talkie style cell phone features. The verdict, delivered by a nine person jury followed a 13 day trial and 2-1/2 days of jury deliberations. Broadcom has also brought a complaint against Qualcomm at the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) over patent infringement, asking the Commission to ban the U.S. sale of high-speed wireless phones with Qualcomm chips in them. The commission, which had been due to rule on that case last Friday said it was postponing its decision until June 7.
