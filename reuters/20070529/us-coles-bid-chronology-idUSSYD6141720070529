 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Private equity giant Kohlberg Kravis Roberts KKR.UL abandoned plans to buy Australian retailer Coles Group Ltd. CGJ.AX after launching an initial bid nine months ago. 

 Following is a chronology of events leading up to KKR's decision to pull out of a consortium planning to make an offer for Coles, Australia's second-largest retailer after Woolworths Ltd. ( WOW.AX ). KKR said late on Monday it had abandoned its latest attempt because of concerns about the health of some of the retailer's businesses, just hours after partner CVC CVC.UL pulled out. August 22, 2006 - Coles board confirms it has received a "highly conditional" takeover proposal from a group of private investment funds led by KKR. September 6 - Coles board rejects A$17.3 billion buyout bid, saying the indicative A$14.50 a share offer substantially undervalues the company. October 19 - Coles board rejects a sweetened A$18.2 billion bid. KKR bidding consortium pulls out. February 23, 2007 - Coles puts itself up for sale, saying it has received a number of approaches in recent weeks.

WES.AX launches surprise A$19.7 billion bid for Coles, takes control of an 11.3 percent stake. April 10 - Coles says the KKR consortium is confident of matching or beating the Wesfarmers offer, raising the prospect of a bidding war and pushing Coles shares to a record high. April 17 - Australian retailer Woolworths Ltd. ( WOW.AX ) confirms it is considering making a joint offer for some Coles assets. May 10 - British retailer Tesco Plc ( TSCO.L ) decides not to pursue a bid for Coles because of the "massive turnaround" required. May 11 - KKR begins two-week exclusive due diligence. May 17 - Coles sets final bid date of week beginning June 25 after reporting a soft 0.6 percent rise in quarterly sales. May 25 - Wesfarmers begins due diligence on Coles. May 28 - KKR and CVC confirm they have pulled out of the buyout consortium due to concerns about the financial performance of some Coles businesses. Remaining bid partners are Bain, Blackstone Group BG.UL, Carlyle Group CYL.UL and  TPG TPG.UL. May 29 - Coles shares fall as much as 4 percent after KKR and CVC pull out.
