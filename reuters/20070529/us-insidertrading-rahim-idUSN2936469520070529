 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors charged a former Pakistani banker with securities fraud on Tuesday, saying he made nearly $8 million in illegal profits after getting insider information on pending merger deals from a former Credit Suisse investment banker. 

 Ajaz Rahim, 44, who was country head of investment banking at Faysal Bank in Karachi, faces one conspiracy charge and 25 counts of securities fraud, according to the federal complaint. Hafiz Naseem, who worked for Credit Suisse's Global Energy Group in New York, has been charged with one count of conspiracy and 25 counts of securities fraud. From April 2006 through about February 2007, Rahim received nonpublic information from Naseem about nine Credit Suisse client merger deals and bought securities, netting over $7.5 million in illegal profits, the government charged. "A warrant has been issued for his arrest and we're going to seek to execute the warrant," a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's office said of Rahim. She would not say whether the warrant was issued in the United States or Pakistan. Prosecutors accused Rahim of trading on inside information about acquisitions including Northwestern Corp., Energy Partners Ltd., Veritas DGC, Jacuzzi Brands, Trammell Crow Co., Hydril Company, Caremark RX, John H. Harland Co., and TXU Corp. On the conspiracy charge, Rahim could face a maximum of five years in prison. Each of the securities fraud charges carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and fines. Earlier this month, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission also charged Rahim with insider trading. Naseem, a 37-year-old Pakistani, was arrested on May 3 and was released earlier in May on a $1 million bail bond, and home detention restrictions.
