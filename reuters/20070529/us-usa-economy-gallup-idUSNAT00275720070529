 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Investors' confidence in the U.S. economy rose in May to its highest level since January, as optimism in personal investments climbed to the highest level in five years, a survey showed on Tuesday. 

 The UBS/Gallup Index of Investor Optimism rose to 95 in May from 74 in April, reversing three months of declines. The Personal Dimension of the Index, which measures optimism about investors' own personal investment portfolios, increased 13 points in May to 75, its highest level since March 2002 when it stood at 80, UBS said. Investors also are more optimistic about the outlook for the US economy generally. The Economic Dimension, which measures investors' feelings about the direction of the overall US economy over the next 12 months, increased to 20 in May, an eight point increase from the prior month. Although this increase represents a substantial improvement in optimism about the direction of the economy over the last month, it remains below its reading in February of 2007. But some 41 percent of investors now say the U.S. economy is in a recovery or sustained expansion, up from 35 percent who responded this way in April. "Increased optimism is being fueled by the ongoing rally in the stock market," said Mike Ryan, Head of UBS Wealth Management Research Americas. "With solid corporate earnings, a strong M&A market, and moderating inflation fears the equity markets have posted impressive gains." Despite the increase in investor optimism with respect to the market and the overall economy, investors continue to voice explicit concerns over high gas prices, Ryan said.
