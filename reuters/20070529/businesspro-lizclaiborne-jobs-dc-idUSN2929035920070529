 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Apparel maker Liz Claiborne Inc. 
LIZ.N is planning job cuts that could total as much as 10 
percent of its workforce, the New York Post reported on its Web 
site on Tuesday. 

  The announcement, part of an overall strategic review 
expected within the next few weeks, would target positions 
across all levels of the company, the Post reported, citing 
unnamed sources.  The company had 17,000 full-time employees worldwide as of 
December, the paper said. Chief Executive William McComb is 
expected to make the results known on July 11, it said.  The paper said that one likely outcome of the review was a 
smaller footprint for Liz Claiborne, with McComb identifying 
five brands worthy of investment -- Juicy Couture, Lucky Brand, 
Kate Spade, Mexx and Liz Claiborne.  No one at Liz Claiborne could be reached immediately for 
comment.  Liz Claiborne reported a 65 percent drop in quarterly 
profit on May 1, citing falling demand for its traditional 
upscale brands like Dana Buchman and consolidating department 
stores that increasingly promote their own private labels.  McComb, who took the reins at Liz Claiborne late last year, 
has said the company must "radically address" its cost 
structure and invest in new capabilities.
