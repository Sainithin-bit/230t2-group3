 LONDON  (Reuters) - Doctors in the United States have shunned GlaxoSmithKline Plc's ( GSK.L ) diabetes drug Avandia since a study was published last week linking the drug to heart-attack risk, according to early prescription data. 

 Information from market intelligence group Impact RX indicates Avandia's share of the market for newly prescribed oral anti-diabetics (OAD) fell to approximately zero from around 10 percent in the two days after the article appeared on May 21. The news took a further toll on Glaxo's battered stock price, which fell more than 2 percent in morning trade on Tuesday. "While two days of prescription data cannot be regarded as a rigorous test ... this reaction is far worse than we had anticipated and suggests that there could be as much as 22 percent downside risk to GSK's near term earnings, suggesting that there is still further downside to GSK's share price," Deutsche Bank analysts, citing the results, said in a note. Shares in Europe's biggest drugmaker fell around 9 percent last week on the critical broadside from top U.S. cardiologist Steven Nissen in the New England Journal of Medicine. The stock fell as much as 2.6 percent to a two-year low of 12.99 pounds, making it the biggest FTSE 100 loser in an overall stronger London market. Nissen's pooled, or meta, analysis of 42 clinical trials concluded Avandia increased the risk of heart attack by 43 percent and cardiac-related death by 64 percent, dealing a major blow to Glaxo's second biggest-selling drug. Avandia generated global sales of 1.6 billion pounds ($3.2 billion) last year, accounting for 7 percent of group revenues and significantly more of profits. Glaxo has said it strongly disagrees with the study findings, which contradict results from large-scale outcome studies. GLAXO 'CONFIDENT' Commenting on last week's fall in U.S. prescriptions, Glaxo said it was far too early to pick out any trend. "Two days of data is not enough to reach sensible conclusions on the trend for Avandia new prescriptions," a company spokesman said. "The meta analysis published last week, whilst not rigorous enough to reach conclusions about adverse events, has generated significant negative and erroneous publicity. However, we remain confident that the significant benefits of Avandia continue to outweigh any treatment risks." Deutsche said new and switch prescription data from 1,900 U.S. primary care physicians showed Avandia's rolling average share of the newly written OAD prescription market on May 21, 22 and 23 was 10, 8 and 6 percent respectively, suggesting its share dropped to almost zero on May 22 and 23. At the same time, the rate of patients switching from one drug to another was three times the usual level, with Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.'s ( 4502.T ) rival drug Actos share of the new prescription market increasing from 10 to 22 percent. Glaxo is hoping to show conclusively its medicine is safe with results of another major clinical study, known as RECORD, looking specifically at the heart risks associated with Avandia. However, the future of that trial, which is scheduled to run through 2008, is uncertain because some patients have dropped out following reports of the drug's risks, the company's medical director Ronald Krall told the New York Times at the weekend.
