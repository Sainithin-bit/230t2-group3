 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Phillips-Van Heusen Corp. ( PVH.N ), owner of the Calvin Klein brand, said on Tuesday that a jump in Calvin Klein royalty revenue and strong sales of wholesale dress shirts and at outlet stores helped it post better-than-expected quarterly profit, sending shares up 1.4 percent in after-hours trade. 

 The apparel maker, which also owns the Van Heusen and IZOD brands, reported net income for the first quarter of $53.0 million, or 92 cents per share, up from $48.7 million, or 87 cents per share, a year ago. Analysts on average had expected the company to post 86 cents, according to Reuters Estimates, after the New York-based company had forecast 85 cents per share. The latest quarter's results included a gain of 2 cents per share associated with the release of cash held in escrow from the sale of certain minority interests, which was partially offset by $1.4 million in costs related to Calvin Klein better specialty retail stores and the company's Timberland TBL.N apparel business. The company also raised its full-year earnings forecast to a range of $3.06 to $3.10 per share, from its prior forecast of $3.00 to $3.06 per share, on revenue it expects to reach $2.41 billion. Analysts were expecting full-year profit of $3.07 per share, excluding items, on revenue of $2.40 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Phillips-Van Heusen shares rose 78 cents to $57.10 in after-hours trading after closing at $56.32 on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday.
