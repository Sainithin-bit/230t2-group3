 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Borders Group Inc. BGP.N, the world's second-largest bookseller, on Tuesday posted a wider quarterly loss as sales at established stores fell. 

 The net loss widened to $35.9 million, or 61 cents a share, from $20.2 million, or 31 cents a year ago. Quarterly sales rose 2 percent to a lower-than-expected $878.8 million, while comparable store sales at Borders superstores in the U.S. fell 1.9 percent during the quarter ended May 5. Analysts, on average, were expecting Borders to post a loss of 38 cents a share for the quarter on about $881.6 million in sales, according to Reuters Estimates. "Previously we reported that 2007 would be a year of transition as we execute our long-term strategic plan for the turnaround of the company," Chief Executive George Jones said in a statement. "The current sales environment was more challenging than we anticipated." The bookseller is eyeing a return to earnings growth in 2008, Jones added. Last week, Barnes & Noble posted first-quarter results that topped Wall Street's expectations, buoyed by sales of best-selling titles like Rhonda Byrne's "The Secret" and Chris Bohjalian's "The Double Bind." Borders also said book sales were "slightly negative" on a category basis, while DVD sales were flat. Music sales continued their decline, the company said. The company also said it opened four stores in the U.S. during the period.
