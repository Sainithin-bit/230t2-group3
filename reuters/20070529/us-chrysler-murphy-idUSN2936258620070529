 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Chrysler Group DCXGn.DE said on Tuesday its marketing chief would leave the company, marking the second top executive departure since the automaker's sale to private-equity group Cerberus Capital Management earlier this month. 

 George Murphy, 51, vice president of global brand marketing, was not replaced immediately. Murphy, who will leave the company this week, has been with Chrysler since 2001. "George has made a key contribution to our efforts to retool our brands -- Chrysler, Jeep and Dodge," said Steven Landry, Chrysler's North American sales chief. Murphy's tenure had coincided with several ad campaigns that were criticized by Chrysler dealers, including last summer's "Dr. Z" campaign, which touted the company's ties with Daimler just months before it was spun off by the German automaker. He also developed a new advertising campaign for the Chrysler brand, called "Engineered Beautifully," which started earlier this month. Murphy joined Chrysler in February 2001 after two years with Ford Motor Co ( F.N ), where he was general marketing manager for the Ford Division. Murphy is the latest executive to leave Chrysler since DaimlerChrysler AG agreed in May to sell an 80.1 percent stake in the company to Cerberus in a deal expected to close in the third quarter. In a move seen as Chrysler Chief Executive Tom LaSorda's effort to garner a team better suited for Chrysler's new ownership, the automaker last week also replaced executive vice president of procurement and supply, Peter Rosenfeld, with Simon Boag. Boag had been head of production planning for Mercedes-Benz in Germany most recently. Chrysler's U.S. sales were down 3 percent in the first four months of this year after falling 7 percent in 2006. The automaker, which posted an operating loss of $2 billion in the first quarter of this year, is cutting 13,000 jobs in an effort to return to profitability by 2008.
