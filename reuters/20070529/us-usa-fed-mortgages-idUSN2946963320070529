 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve said on Tuesday a public hearing on potential new rules to curb abusive home mortgage lending practices would cover prepayment penalties, low documentation loans and consideration of borrowers' repayment abilities. 

 The four key topics for the June 14 public hearing on how it might formulate new rules to stamp out mortgage abuses also will include escrow accounts for taxes and insurance on subprime loans, the Fed said in a statement. The Fed is gathering information on options under the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act in response to a rising default rate in subprime segment of the U.S. mortgage market as home prices have fallen. U.S. lawmakers have criticized the Fed for lax rules on mortgage broking and underwriting that they say have contributed to contributed mortgage fraud and abuse, including pushing subprime borrowers into adjustable rate mortgages that they can not afford after the rates adjust upward. The Fed said it was requesting comment on whether to ban prepayment penalties that extend beyond the first adjustment period on an adjustable-rate mortgage. It also requested comment on whether enhanced disclosure of prepayment penalties would address concerns on abuses. On escrows for taxes and insurance, the Fed said it was seeking comment on whether they should be required for subprime mortgage loans and if so, should consumers be permitted to opt out of them. The Fed also asked whether lenders should be required to disclose the absence of escrows to consumers and to disclose an estimate of the consumer's tax and insurance obligations. The Fed said it is seeking whether low-documentation, or "stated income" loans, should be prohibited for subprime borrowers. It also is seeking comment on whether lenders should be required to offer consumers a full-documentation loan instead of a "stated income" loan. Regarding borrowers' repayment abilities, the Fed said it wanted comment on whether lenders should be required to underwrite all loans based on the fully indexed rate of an adjustable rate loan and fully amortized payments. The Fed asked hearing participants whether lenders should make a rebuttable presumption that a loan is unaffordable if the borrower's debt-to-income ratio exceeds 50 percent at the time of loan origination. For all of the four key topics, the Fed requested comment on how such restrictions would affect consumers and the type and terms of credit offered.
