 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of CDW Corp. CDWC.O rose more than 12 percent to a seven-year high on Tuesday following a report that the computer technology retailer may be a takeover target of private equity firms. 

 CDW shares, which have already climbed about 39 percent since early March, rose this morning on Nasdaq to $84.90, their highest level since September 2000. Private equity firms are in talks for a buyout of CDW, which has a market capitalization of about $6 billion, the Wall Street Journal said on Tuesday, citing unnamed sources. Madison Dearborn Partners is considered in the lead to buy CDW. The talks are at a sensitive stage and could fall apart, the newspaper said, adding that the buyout firm might also face some late competition. CDW, based in Vernon Hill, Illinois, and Madison Dearborn were not immediately available for comment. Founder Michael Krasny, who serves as chairman emeritus, owns about 22 percent of CDW's outstanding shares, as of the end of March. CDW, which mainly sells to government agencies and businesses through a Web-based catalog, last month posted a 24.5 percent rise in first-quarter net income, buoyed by higher sales of notebook computers, storage equipment, software and video-related equipment. The results came after the company had expanded its distribution capacity, reorganized its sales force and entered a new market -- selling complex computer systems customized for each client -- in a bid to boost sales. Shares of CDW gave up some of their gains in afternoon trading to be up 9.5 percent to $82.76. CDW competes against companies like Insight Enterprises Inc. ( NSIT.O ) and Dell Inc. DELL.O.
