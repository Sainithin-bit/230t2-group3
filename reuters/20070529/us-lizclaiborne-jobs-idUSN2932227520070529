 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Clothing maker Liz Claiborne Inc. LIZ.N is planning to cut as much as 10 percent of its work force, the New York Post reported on its Web site on Tuesday. 

 The job cuts, part of a strategic review to be announced on July 11, would target positions across all levels of the company, the Post reported, citing unnamed sources. The company has about 17,000 full-time employees worldwide a spokeswoman said. She declined to comment on the Post report. The Post said that one likely outcome of the review was a smaller footprint for Liz Claiborne, with Chief Executive William McComb identifying just five brands as worthy of investment -- Juicy Couture, Lucky Brand, Kate Spade, Mexx and Liz Claiborne. The company has about 40 brands. Liz Claiborne reported a 65 percent drop in quarterly profit on May 1, citing falling demand for its traditional upscale brands like Dana Buchman and consolidating department stores that increasingly promote their own private labels. McComb, who joined Liz Claiborne from Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ.N ) late last year, has said the company must radically address its cost structure and invest in new capabilities. Morgan Keegan & Co. analyst Brad Stephens said he had not heard anything about the job cuts, but added that they seemed like a good idea. "Given what the bigger picture is," he said, "that they are going to start reducing their brand portfolio, it makes sense." Liz Claiborne shares were up 37 cents, or 1.1 percent, at $34.81 in early New York Stock Exchange trade.
