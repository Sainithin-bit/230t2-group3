 MINNEAPOLIS  (Reuters) - A U.S. prosecutor on Tuesday said the government likely was at least six months away from deciding whether to bring any criminal charges related to stock options practices at UnitedHealth Group Inc. ( UNH.N ). 

 Federal prosecutors have been investigating potential wrongdoing in options grants to top executives at UnitedHealth, which disclosed a year ago that it had been subpoenaed by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York. An internal company report in October 2006 concluded that options awarded to executives including the insurer's former Chairman and Chief Executive William McGuire, who stepped down after the probe, likely were backdated. At a court hearing in a shareholder lawsuit against the company in Minnesota, Assistant U.S. Attorney Glen McGorty said that the criminal probe was ongoing. "The criminal case is indefinite but not forever," he said, adding that it would be "probably another six months" before a determination on any possible charges would be made by the U.S. Attorney's office. The U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan declined to comment when contacted by Reuters about the investigation. Besides the government probe, Minneapolis-based UnitedHealth faces a barrage of shareholder lawsuits over its past options awards practices. In backdating, a company sets the grant price for the stock option retroactively to maximize potential profit to the recipient. The practice isn't necessarily illegal, but needs to be properly accounted for and disclosed. At Tuesday's court hearing, Judge Franklin Noel ordered UnitedHealth to release about 13 million internal documents related to options practices to shareholder lawyers by June 8. Another 13 million documents must be released by October 1, the judge said. McGorty asked the judge to block the release of internal UnitedHealth memos and other documents requested by the shareholder lawyers that might have a bearing on the criminal investigation. The judge did not immediately rule on the government's request. UnitedHealth also has sought to prevent the turnover of these documents in the shareholder lawsuits. Separately, UnitedHealth held its annual meeting on Tuesday, with shareholders rejecting four stockholder proposals, including a "say on pay" measure that would have given investors a nonbinding vote on executive compensation. Shareholders reelected CEO Stephen Hemsley and nonexecutive Chairman Richard Burke to the board of directors, as well as independent director William Ballard, and confirmed the appointment of new outside director Robert Darretta. Company proposals to require majority voting for directors and annual director elections also were approved. In a statement, Burke said that "everyone at UnitedHealth Group is gratified by the strong shareholder support for the company and the solid progress we have achieved in the past year in corporate governance."
