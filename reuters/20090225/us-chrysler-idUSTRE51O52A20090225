 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Chrysler Chief Executive Bob Nardelli was meeting on Wednesday with members of the U.S. auto industry task force as officials begin to review the automaker's request for up to $5 billion in additional aid. 

 Nardelli was joined in the meeting by Chrysler President Tom LaSorda, who heads the automaker's manufacturing operations, and Chief Financial Officer Ron Kolka, according to a person briefed on the meeting. Chrysler, which is controlled by private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management CBS.UL, has received $4 billion in U.S. government loans and has said it needs more funding to complete a turnaround at a time when auto sales are slumping. General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) Chief Executive Rick Wagoner is expected to meet with members of the task force appointed by U.S. President Barack Obama on Thursday, a person briefed on that planned meeting said. GM has asked for up to $30 billion in U.S. emergency aid. (Reporting by  John Crawley ; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
