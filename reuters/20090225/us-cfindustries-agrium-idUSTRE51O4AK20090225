 NEW YORK/TORONTO  (Reuters) - Canadian fertilizer producer Agrium Inc ( AGU.TO ) AGU.N. launched an unsolicited offer to buy U.S. rival CF Industries ( CF.N ) for $3.6 billion in cash and stock on Wednesday, in a move to expand its presence in the nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer markets. 

 The bid, which is a 30 percent premium to CF's closing share price, is conditional on CF dropping its hostile offer for U.S.-based fertilizer producer Terra Industries TRA.N, which Terra has rejected. CF said its board of directors will evaluate Agrium's proposal carefully and advise its shareholders in due course. "CF's got a great basket of phosphate assets. And I would argue that on a long-term basis, phosphate assets are going to be a lot more attractive and post higher returns than nitrogen assets," said Morningstar analyst Ben Johnson in Chicago. "I think that the prospective synergies between CF and Agrium are definitely more compelling than those between CF and Terra," he added. Prices of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers tumbled toward the end of 2008 as farmers avoided the market in hopes that prices would fall ahead of the spring planting season in North America. Brazilian farmers, hurt by tight credit markets, also cut spending on inputs. But prices have begun to pick up slightly ahead of the North American planting season. Fertilizer prices had peaked in mid-2008, due to high grain prices and tight fertilizer inventory levels. Shares of fertilizer companies are still well below peak levels touched in mid-2008, making this a good time for companies in the sector to consider acquisitions. In an interview with Reuters, Agrium's chief executive, Mike Wilson, said he saw no regulatory hurdles to the deal and hopes to close the proposed CF acquisition by the end of the second quarter. "We expect no material impediments on this deal. The assets are more complementary than overlapping," he said. CF shares were up 13 percent at $62.84 on the New York Stock Exchange in early afternoon. Agrium shares were down 6.6 percent at C$46.99 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Agrium is offering $72 in cash and stock for each CF share. CF stakeholders would receive one Agrium common share and $31.70 in cash for each share. Agrium said its offer is not subject to financing conditions. The company said it has sufficient cash resources and committed financing underwritten by Royal Bank of Canada ( RY.TO ) and Bank of Nova Scotia ( BNS.TO ) to fund the cash portion of the proposal. Agrium, which sees annual savings of about $150 million within three years of the deal closing, expects the deal to be beneficial to earnings and cash flow beginning in 2010. CF-TERRA BID CF Industries formally launched its hostile bid to buy rival Terra on Monday, and said it was still interested in holding talks with Terra to seal a deal. However, Terra has advised shareholders to reject the offer. A Terra representative was not immediately available for comment on Wednesday. CF started with a bid of 0.4235 of a share for each Terra share. At Monday's closing prices, that offer was worth about $2.37 billion. The offer expires on May 15. CF has also said it plans to nominate three directors to replace three members of Terra's board at this year's annual meeting. Even if the proposed deal does find favor with Terra's shareholders, it could run into regulatory hurdles, as a combination of the two companies would create the largest global producer of nitrogen fertilizer, which is a key nutrient for corn. Terra shares were down 1.3 percent at $24.50 on the NYSE. ($1=$1.26 Canadian) (Reporting by Scott Anderson and Euan Rocha; editing by Rob Wilson and  Matthew Lewis )
