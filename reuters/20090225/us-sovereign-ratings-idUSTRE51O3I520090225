 LONDON  (Reuters) - The head of sovereign ratings at Standard & Poor's agency told Reuters on Wednesday he expected more sovereign ratings downgrades than upgrades this year and flagged financial markets' concern about the health of public finances. 

 Debt management agency chiefs from Japan, Germany, France, and Britain acknowledged a huge amount of borrowing would be needed to fund financial rescues and economic stimulus packages, but showed no concern about their ability to do so. The head of German finance agency, Carl Heinz Daube, also shot down mounting speculation that Germany and other European countries may club together to issue a joint bond to help euro zone states like Ireland and Greece, whose finances have deteriorated sharply during the global crisis. David Beers, head of sovereign ratings at Standard & Poor's, said on the sidelines of a debt conference in London that the weakness of the global economy could be expected to have an impact on some countries' credit ratings. "There were more (sovereign) downgrades than upgrades last year and we expect that margin to widen this year," he said. His comments came as the ratings agency cut the sovereign credit ratings on Ukraine to triple-C plus from single-B, renewing worries about eastern Europe. That helped to underpin bonds and the dollar and also unsettled European stocks. S&P rates 123 sovereigns and before the move on Ukraine had 28 on negative outlook and only two on a positive outlook. Asked about sovereign credit default swaps (CDSs), or the cost of protecting holders of sovereign bonds from default -- many of which have soared to record highs recently -- Beers noted that highly-rated countries were particularly affected. "At the high end (triple-A to single-A rated sovereigns) at the moment, there is something of a disconnect between the CDS story and the debt market," he said. The high end of the sovereign credit default swap (CDS) market is relatively young compared with the emerging market end, and is less liquid, he said. "It is registering concern and uncertainty about what's happening fiscally and the potential challenges governments are facing. Whether it turns out to be an accurate assessment of default risk we'll have to wait and see." FUNDING NEEDS At the conference, debt management agency officials from Germany, France and Japan said they expected to borrow more this year than last. "Last year I had to fund 213 billion euros, this year it's going to be 323 billion euros," said Germany's Daube. Daube also said he did not expect a common European bond to be issued because there are 16 euro zone states, each with a different fiscal position. "It will not happen," he said. A French government source told Reuters there was no plan underway to issue a euro zone bond. Daube's French counterpart also expected to increase issuance this year compared with 2008. "I'm sitting on 1 trillion euros of debt, around 50 percent of French GDP," Philippe Mills, the head of Agence France Tresor, France's debt management office, told the same panel. "Gross issuance both from bills and bonds last year was 270 billion euros and this year I'm forecasting to borrow 330 billion euros from both bills and bonds." However, these officials showed few signs of concern about the market's ability or willingness to buy their paper. "Sixty-four percent of French state debt is owned by non-residents. Buyers are primarily from Europe and Asia, and third position is Middle East," Mills told Reuters.
