 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Auto parts maker Visteon Corp ( VC.N ) warned on Wednesday that it was in danger of breaching its debt covenants following a 10th consecutive quarterly loss and said it was considering selling off or eliminating parts of its operations to shore up cash. 

 Shares of Visteon, the struggling former parts affiliate of Ford Motor Co ( F.N ), fell 13 percent in early trade. The stock has lost 96 percent of its value in the past year. The warning by Visteon underscores heightened pressure on the auto supply industry as U.S. auto sales remain at their lowest level in 27 years, forcing every major automaker to slash production. Visteon, which cut 9,300 jobs in 2008 and plans more reductions, said the  continued downturn in the global auto industry and tight credit markets had squeezed its financial results, cash flow and liquidity. "As a result, Visteon cannot assure that it will remain in compliance with the terms of its outstanding debt instruments," the company said in a statement. Visteon Chief Executive Donald Stebbins said on a conference call, "We continue to work to address the significant operational and liquidity challenges presented by this environment." Stebbins declined to take questions on the call, citing "uncertainty and our ongoing work." Among the options Visteon said it was considering to address future liquidity needs were delaying capital expenditures and restructuring measures that could include curtailing, eliminating or disposing of substantial assets or operations. The company had drawn nearly all of the funds available under its U.S. revolving credit facility and had $1.18 billion in cash at the end of last year. Visteon said its fourth-quarter net loss widened to $328 million, or $2.53 per share, from $43 million, or 33 cents per share, a year earlier. The latest results included asset impairment charges of $200 million. Revenue fell to $1.65 billion from $2.86 billion. Visteon, which completed a three-year restructuring launched shortly after a bailout by Ford ( F.N ) in 2005, has come under intense pressure in recent months from tight credit and from production cuts that accelerated in the fourth quarter and the early weeks of 2009. The Wall Street Journal reported last month that Visteon had hired legal and financial advisers to prepare for possible bankruptcy proceedings. Visteon said it has been advised by Kirkland & Ellis and Rothschild since 2003. U.S. auto suppliers last week submitted a formal request to the U.S. Treasury for $18.5 billion in emergency funding, saying they have been shut off from credit at a time when payments from automakers are declining rapidly. Executives and analysts have warned that a wave of bankruptcies in the supply sector is inevitable in the next weeks and months without emergency federal support. Ford spun off its component operations as Visteon in 2000, but stepped in to save the company in 2005 by taking over some of its troubled assets and unionized workers. Ford said on Tuesday that it would keep four of the former Visteop plants it took back operating until at least 2011 and restructure them for sale under the terms of a proposed contract change with the United Auto Workers union. Visteon still derives a third of its sales from Ford. The failure of a major supplier could prompt a costly production disruption for automakers and suppliers due to the interlocking chain of U.S.-based suppliers.
