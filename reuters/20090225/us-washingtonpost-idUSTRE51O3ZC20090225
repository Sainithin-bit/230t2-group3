 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Washington Post Co ( WPO.N ) reported a smaller quarterly profit on Wednesday, underscoring the chronic weakness in newspaper advertising that is hampering the entire industry. 

 While shares declined 3 percent in morning trade, the newspaper publisher's revenue rose helped by growth in its cable units and education division, which includes the Kaplan franchise. Profit fell to $18.8 million, or $2.01 per share, which includes an $69.6 impairment charge related to the declining value of some of its smaller newspapers and other items. A year earlier, the company posted a profit of $82.9 million or $8.71 per share. Publishers across the industry are taking similar charges. Revenue rose 3 percent to $1.16 billion from $1.13 billion. Revenue in its education business rose 13 percent to $609.1 million, while newspaper publishing revenue fell 13 percent to $201.7 million. The education unit accounted for 52 percent of overall fourth quarter revenue. Print advertising revenue at the Washington Post fell 21 percent to $101.8 million for the fourth quarter. Also on Wednesday, Media General Inc ( MEG.N ), publisher of 24 daily newspapers including the Tampa Tribune and the Richmond Times-Dispatch, said it expects revenue declines in nearly all its advertising categories. As a result, Media General plans to cut costs further by delaying pay increases, suspending dividend payments and employee retirement payments from April through year-end. Media General also plans a employee furlough program and said it does not expect 2009 earnings to support a profit sharing contribution to retirement plans or management bonuses. In addition to the worst advertising market in years, some newspaper publishers are also saddled with heavy debt burdens that have forced them to seek bankruptcy protection. Journal Register Co JRCO.PK, publisher of 20 daily papers, filed for Chapter 11 protection on Saturday. It was followed closely by a bankruptcy filing from the publisher of the Philadelphia Inquirer and the Daily News on Sunday. Washington Post shares fell $10.49 or 2.7 percent to $374.50 on the New York Stock Exchange. Media General shares rose 3 cents, or 1.6 percent to $1.93 also on NYSE.
