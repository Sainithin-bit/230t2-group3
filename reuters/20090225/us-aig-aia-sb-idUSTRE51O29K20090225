 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Three potential bidders remain for the sale of a large stake in American International Group's AIA Asian life insurance unit, people close to the matter said, as the auction process heads into its final week. 

 UK insurer Prudential Plc, Canadian insurer Manulife and Singapore sovereign wealth fund, Temasek Holdings are still considering offers for the roughly $20 billion unit, the sources said, although no formal bids have been submitted. The Hong Kong-based unit, known formally as American International Assurance Company Ltd, has a strong insurance market presence throughout Asia. The auction has been hampered by AIG's worsening financial state and a drop in markets globally, limiting the amount of aggressive buyers. Bank of China dropped out of the process last month, granting a big blow to the auction as AIG hoped the cash-rich bank would submit an attractive offer, according to sources. HSBC considered making a bid but decided not to, the sources said. Final bids are due on Friday, the sources say. "We continue to work with the US government to evaluate potential new alternatives for addressing AIG's financial challenges," said AIG's Hong Kong-based spokeswoman Patricia Chua. "We will provide a complete update when we report financial results in the near future." (Reporting by  Michael Flaherty , Editing by Ken Wills)
