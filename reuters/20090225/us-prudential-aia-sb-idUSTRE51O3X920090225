 LONDON  (Reuters) - UK insurance company Prudential Plc is unlikely to make an offer for American International Group AIA Asian life insurance unit by the end of this week, a person familiar with the matter said. 

 The company is still considering whether to bid or not, but needs more time for due diligence, the person added. The deadline for bids is on Friday. Prudential declined to comment. Reuters reported earlier that no offers for the roughly $20 billion AIA unit have been submitted yet, and that the number of potential bidders has dwindled to Prudential, Canadian insurer Manulife and Singapore sovereign wealth fund Temasek Holdings.
