 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Two money managers were charged with running an estimated $550 million investment fraud on Wednesday that used client money as "their personal piggy-bank" to furnish lavish lifestyles including a horse farm, cars, and payments to a former wife. 

 Paul Greenwood, 61, and Stephen Walsh, 64, managing general partners of WG Trading Co, with main offices in Greenwich, Connecticut, were charged with conspiracy, securities fraud and wire fraud. They were arrested by the FBI on Wednesday morning. They also were charged in a separate civil complaint filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The alleged scheme was long-running, beginning in 1996 and still operating through this month, according to a criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. The SEC said the men solicited numerous institutional investors, including educational institutions and public pension and retirement plans, by promising to invest their money in an "enhanced equity index" strategy. Instead of investing the money as promised, they stole investor funds for their person use, the commission said. Of the $667 million that clients invested, Greenwood and Walsh misused as much as $554 million, the SEC said. Greenwood was accused of using investor funds to buy horses and expensive collectibles, while Walsh was accused of using investor funds for himself and to make large payments to his ex-wife. The SEC complaint said other spending included multimillion-dollar homes and cars. Attorneys for the two men were not immediately available. A woman who answered the phone at a WG Trading office in North Hills, New York, declined to comment. There was no answer at the firm's main office in Greenwich. Greenwood and Walsh had been suspended by the National Futures Association on February 12 for not disclosing their financial records and failing to answer questions on numerous promissory notes "totaling hundreds of millions of dollars" that they executed, the association said. Another person, former WG Trading employee Mark Bloom, was also arrested on Wednesday and charged separately in U.S. District Court in Manhattan with fraud related to his activities at his North Hills Management LLC financial firm in New York. Bloom stopped working for WG Trading in 2001, according to the court papers. The SEC also brought civil charges against Bloom, saying he misused more than $13.2 million of investor funds in part to support a lavish lifestyle. On February 9, the futures association also took enforcement action against Bloom, saying he failed to cooperate in its investigation of allegations he operated an illegal commodity pool and "exercised unlawful control" over $8 million from a charitable trust and a related entity that he was given to invest. A phone number for North Hills Management could not immediately be located. (Reporting by  Martha Graybow ; editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)
