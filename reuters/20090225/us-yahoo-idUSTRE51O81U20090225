 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - U.S. Internet firm Yahoo Inc ( YHOO.O ) is "not opposed" to doing a deal that would potentially sell its search business, Chief Financial Officer Blake Jorgensen said on Wednesday. 

 But he said the search business is deeply intertwined with Yahoo's other online products and properties, and so any deal, whether a partnership or a sale, would be done for the right reasons and the right economics. "It's extremely difficult to draw a line down the middle of the organization and split it into two pieces," Jorgensen told the Goldman Sachs Technology and Internet conference. He did not mention specifically Microsoft Corp ( MSFT.O ), which has repeatedly said it was interested in doing a search deal with Yahoo to compete against market leader Google Inc. The comments come as Yahoo is rumored to be on the brink of undertaking a major corporate reorganization under Chief Executive Carol Bartz, who took the reins in January. Yahoo rebuffed a $47.5 billion acquisition bid from Microsoft last year, and saw a deal to form a search advertising partnership with Google fall apart amid antitrust concerns. Bartz has said she did not join the company to sell it, nor did she have a preconceived notion of doing a search deal, but that "everything is on the table. Yahoo's stock was up 2 percent, or 27 cents, at $12.75 in after-market trade, after closing down 27 cents in the Nasdaq session. (Reporting by  Alexei Oreskovic ; Editing by  Gary Hill )
