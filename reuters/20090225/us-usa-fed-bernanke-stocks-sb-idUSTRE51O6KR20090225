 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Wednesday recent sharp declines in stock prices mostly reflected investor attitudes about risk and had become detached from real U.S. economic fundamentals. 

 "The risk appetite of investors changes over time and right now the standard measures of the risk premium that investors are charging to hold stocks are at very high levels relative to anything we have seen in recent decades," Bernanke said in semi-annual testimony to Congress. "The stock values reflect not so much the fundamentals, the long-term profitability of the economy, but they also reflect investor attitudes about risk and uncertainty which right now are at very high levels," he told lawmakers during questions. U.S. stocks have fallen to 12-year lows this month, with the benchmark S&P 500 down about 15 percent and the Dow Jones industrial average off about 16 percent since the start of 2009. Bernanke said that while the stock market was one of the important financial indicators, other key variables like credit markets were painting a different picture. "It does reflect the profit expectations of a large number of firms, therefore it is closely tied to expectations about the economy," he said, referring to stocks. "That being said, a large share of the profits that are being reflected in stock prices are not U.S.-based, they are foreign-based, so that obscures the connection a little bit." Bernanke attributed the rapid and sharp decline in stock prices to investors being "skittish about holding any risky assets and (who) have moved in a very substantial way toward the safest assets like Treasury securities".
