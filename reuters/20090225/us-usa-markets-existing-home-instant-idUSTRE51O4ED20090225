 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The pace of existing home sales in the United States fell in January to a 4.49 million-unit annual rate while home prices dropped along with inventories, the National Association of Realtors said in a report on Wednesday. 

 KEY POINTS: * Economists polled by Reuters were expecting home resales to rise to a 4.79 million-unit pace, from the 4.74 rate initially reported for December, which was unchanged. * The inventory of existing homes for sale fell 2.7 percent to 3.60 million from the 3.70 million overstock reported in December. * The median national home price declined 14.8 percent from a year ago to $170,300 - the lowest since a $169,400 level seen in March 2003. COMMENTS: KEITH HEMBRE, CHIEF ECONOMIST, FIRST AMERICAN FUNDS, MINNEAPOLIS: "The numbers are not very good. They certainly missed expectations and prices were substantially down for the month. That's probably not too surprising, I don't know why the expectations were up so high to begin with. "Supply in the month ticked up because of a slowdown in sales, and its still quite high relative to the typical balance to market. I think we'll look at downward price pressure from here, and given the stickiness of mortgage rates and weakness of employment, its difficult to see demand conditions improve in the near-term. "This is not a primary market mover. I think broad-based expectations are that the housing market remains out of balance, so its not a huge surprise in terms of the trend. If anything, the market is reacting to the over-reaction yesterday because of Bernanke. "Here's what colors our view for the market: earnings are under meaningful downward pressure, and there's not going to be a catalyst for any improvement improve until the profits turn up. In my view, the pieces aren't in place for that to happen." RICK MECKLER, PRESIDENT, LIBERTYVIEW CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, NEW YORK: "It just shows that the traders, who are the major participants in the market, are looking for the next momentum move. The disappointing number gave them a chance to make a quick trade... and take profits." "I think if we had had a down day yesterday, this number would have gone unnoticed." "I doubt a lot of people got up today and say if the existing home sales number is this, I'm selling. In a very skittish market, people sell on bad news. It's really the follow-up support levels that make a difference." PIERRE ELLIS, SENIOR ECONOMIST, DECISION ECONOMICS, NEW YORK: "The home sales report is doubly weak because the pending home sales index seemed to be moving in the opposite direction. That discrepancy hints that an unusually high portion of deals initiated back in December broke down, suggesting that lenders found appraised prices were lower than what people had agreed to pay. The good news is that the inventory of unsold homes fell a bit more, down 2.7 percent. But months' supply did not fall. Inventory is the number of houses on the market. The months' supply is the number of houses divided by the sales rate. What's discouraging is that we seemed to have found a zone of stability for sales, but now we're piercing the lower end of that range." JOHN RYDING, CHIEF ECONOMIST, RDQ ECONOMICS, NEW YORK: "Obviously the headline sales numbers were weaker than expected. "The only silver lining in that, really if it can be called that, is the fact that sales in the west held steady." "While we're seeing a drop in home sales, the area under greatest stress is continuing to outperform as lower prices, which I presume are coming from foreclosure sales, are at least being met by buyers." WARREN WEST, PRINCIPAL, GREENTREE BROKERAGE SERVICES, PHILADELPHIA: "The 4.49 million-unit drop is a little disappointing, but not totally a surprise. We have been warned repeatedly how bad things are. I think every rally we have seen has been met with a sell-off. Yesterday we gained strongly in the markets and now we are seeing people get out of this market. We will be in a tight trading range for some time -- we have been moving sideways since October. The Dow Jones industrial average, for all its faults, is a sentiment indicator and you can see that things just feel bad." MICHELLE MEYER, ECONOMIST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL, NEW YORK: "The data was surprising and came in below expectations, which was led by a sharp drop in the Northeast. That is to be expected as we are seeing the areas hit hard by foreclosures faring better due to price discounts. So, the regions where foreclosures are not as rampant are struggling with sales. The other thing that is noteworthy is the drop in inventory, which is somewhat encouraging. But, you have to be careful as the inventory data is not seasonally adjusted, so you can see seasonal swings." TOMMY WILLIAMS, PRESIDENT, WILLIAMS FINANCIAL ADVISORS, SHREVEPORT, LOUISIANA: "We are in such a state of chaos right now with the attempts to stem foreclosures, the need to burn up the excess inventory, the need to somehow diminish the crisis in confidence with the American public doing defensive saving and being risk averse in this unprecedented crisis." "The Treasury market has priced a lot of this (housing market chaos) in." GARY THAYER, SENIOR ECONOMIST, WACHOVIA SECURITIES, ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI: "Sales were disappointing. We saw another new low for this cycle in January. Sales of condos and coops were hit particularly hard. They were down 10.2 percent. Single-family homes were only down 4.7 percent. It looks like mortgage rates are not low enough yet to entice buyers into the market. Home prices are continuing to slide. They're down 14.8 percent over the past year. That makes housing very affordable relative to income, but buyers are still holding back. We probably need to see a little more confidence in the economy to get buyers back into the housing market and that's just not happening yet." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. equity indexes add to losses. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices hold flat. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar extends gains versus euro.
