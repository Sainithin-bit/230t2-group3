 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President Barack Obama and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner plan to lay out broad principles on Wednesday for Wall Street regulatory reform aimed at preventing a repeat of the current financial crisis, an administration official said. 

 Obama will say later in the day after a high-level White House meeting on financial regulation that "painful experience" shows the rules need to be quickly modernized, according to advance excerpts of his remarks. The president, who took office on January 20, was tackling government oversight of the ailing financial sector the day after his first address to Congress, in which he sought to rally public support for his economic remedies. U.S. stocks fell on Wednesday as investors found little new in his speech on how he planned to stabilize the economy. The financial meltdown is seen at the core of the overall economic crisis that has spread globally. "We can no longer sustain 21st century markets with 20th century regulations," Obama will declare. "Strong financial markets require clear rules of the road, not to hinder financial institutions, but to protect consumers and investors." Obama will say after the talks that he is ready to work on a bipartisan basis on Wall Street reform and hopes to lawmakers can start crafting legislation in the coming weeks. "The president and Treasury secretary share the belief that we can't truly fix this crisis and make sure it never happens again unless we embark on comprehensive regulatory reform," the administration official said. "This afternoon they will lay out their broad principles for regulatory reform legislation that they plan to work with Congress on in the coming weeks leading up to the G20 (summit in London in April)," the official said. Obama will say it is crucial for the Federal Reserve to "actively monitor" institutions it oversees, and the United States must challenge other countries to modernize their rules to prevent crises from spilling across borders. "We must recognize that the challenges we face are not just American challenges, they are global challenges," he will say.
