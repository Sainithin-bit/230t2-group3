 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - AirTran Holdings Inc. AAI.N, the freshly rejected suitor for rival Midwest Air Group Inc MEH.A, will not seek another merger partner simply for the sake of consolidating, AirTran's Chief Operating Officer said on Monday. 

 The parent of low-cost carrier AirTran Airways does not need a merger partner to continue its aggressive growth strategy, and unlike other U.S. airlines, AirTran has less desire that other carriers to see industry capacity cut, Bob Fornaro told Reuters. The No. 10 U.S. airline on Sunday let its eight-month-old bid for Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based Midwest expire. Midwest said it has instead accepted a higher bid of more than $400 million from private equity firm TPG Capital and Northwest Airlines Corp NWA.N. "We're going to continue growing one way or another," Fornaro said. "Consolidation is not a necessity for AirTran." The airline industry has been battered in recent years by low-fare competition and soaring fuel costs. Some industry leaders have predicted a wave of consolidation that could pull excess capacity from the system. So far, such consolidation has failed to materialize. In January, Delta Air Lines Corp ( DAL.N ) rejected a hostile bid from US Airways Group ( LCC.N ). AirTran, the No. 10 U.S. airline and operator of a hub in Atlanta, issued its hostile bid last year to combine Midwest's presence in the central United States with its strength on the East Coast. Midwest resisted the bid from the beginning, saying it has greater potential as a stand-alone carrier. Fornaro said AirTran sees no other U.S. airline that would be such a good fit. "Our focus was diversification," he said. "We don't see anything that's comparable." But that does not mean AirTran would not be part of industry consolidation should the opportunity present itself, experts said. The carrier, which has grown its capacity by more than  20 percent a year for four years, could be a tempting merger partner for another airline, said Stuart Klaskin, aviation consultant at KKC Aviation Consulting. "I think there's going to be a lot of interest in AirTran as an acquirer or an acquirey," he said.
