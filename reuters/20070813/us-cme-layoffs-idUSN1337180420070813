 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - CME Group Inc CME.N, the world's largest derivatives exchange, announced on Monday hundreds of layoffs and an accelerated integration schedule after its $12 billion purchase of CBOT Holdings last month. 

 CME said 380 positions will be cut as it pushes ahead to "leverage synergies" resulting from the merger. The layoffs will be completed by June 2008. All employees involved will be informed this week, CME said, adding that they would be eligible for an "enhanced severance package" including outplacement services. The company also said the integration of futures and options products from the Chicago Board of Trade onto CME's Globex electronic trading platform would take place earlier than the "first quarter 2008" timeframe given previously. CBOT's commodities and equities index products will be migrated over the weekend of January 12-13, 2008, and interest rate products will be moved two weeks later. Additionally, CME and CBOT open outcry markets will be shifted onto a single trading floor at the CBOT building, starting in March. The trading floor consolidation, initially expected 12 to 18 months after the merger, had previously been moved up to the second quarter of 2008. CME's CBOT purchase brought together the two largest U.S. futures exchanges to create a mega-exchange with more than 85 percent of total U.S. futures and options-on-futures volume. On the New York Stock Exchange on Monday, CME shares closed at $581.07, down 2.2 percent or $13.18 per share.
