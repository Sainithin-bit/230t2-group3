 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Accredited Home Lenders Holding Co. LEND.O has sued private equity firm Lone Star Funds to force it to complete the $400 million takeover of the money-losing subprime mortgage lender. 

 Shares of Accredited fell as much as 34.8 percent, after Lone Star late Friday said it would not go through with its $15.10-per-share buyout, citing a "drastic deterioration in the financial and operational condition of the company." But San Diego-based Accredited said the merger agreement prohibits Lone Star from backing out for that reason. It said that if shareholders tendered more than half of Accredited shares by Tuesday, all merger conditions would be met. "Lone Star's refusal to accept tendered shares is a clear repudiation and breach of the merger agreement," Accredited said in a complaint filed Saturday with the Delaware Chancery Court. The lender is seeking to force Lone Star to close the merger, or else pay money damages. Earlier this month, Accredited said its survival was in doubt and a bankruptcy filing was possible. In a statement, Dallas-based Lone Star maintained it does not plan to complete its tender offer for Accredited shares, and "the facts will fully support its position." The firm invests more than $13.3 billion. Subprime lenders make home loans to people with weak credit histories. Like many rivals, Accredited has struggled with investors' refusal to buy loans it makes, leaving it stuck with losses as delinquencies have soared. Dozens of subprime lenders have quit the industry this year. Accredited shares were down $2.88, or 32.3 percent, to $6.03 in morning trading on the Nasdaq, after earlier falling to $5.81. COLD FEET Buyers of other mortgage companies have also begun reassessing their willingness and timetables. On August 7, MGIC Investment Corp. ( MTG.N ) said it wasn't obligated to complete its purchase of mortgage insurer Radian Group Inc ( RDN.N ) after a subprime joint venture became worthless. Two days later, H&R Block Inc ( HRB.N ) said it might delay selling its Option One Mortgage Corp. unit to Cerberus Capital Management at least two months, to year-end. Accredited said the merger agreement prevents Lone Star from backing out because of weakness in the economy, financial and capital markets, or mortgage industry, or deterioration at the company resulting from conditions that were widely known. "The lengthy list of carve-outs ... made it clear that a buyer had to accept the risks inherent in the industry at this historical moment," Accredited said in its complaint. Last Friday, Accredited projected a second-quarter net loss of $40 million to $60 million. It said it had made 59 percent fewer loans than a year earlier, the delinquency rate among loans it serviced had tripled, and its work force had shrunk to 2,600 as of June 30 from 4,200 at year-end 2006. The company also said it had ended July with $175 million of liquidity, down from $240 million at the end of June. (Additional reporting by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty in Bangalore)
