 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Texas power company TXU Corp. TXU.N, making a final push to win support for its $32 billion buyout, said on Monday it would probably split into three separate businesses if the proposed deal failed. 

 The company has set a Sept. 7 shareholder vote, where it would need two-thirds approval to go ahead with its proposed sale to a group led by private equity firms Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. KKR.UL and TPG TPG.UL, formerly known as Texas Pacific Group. TXU's management team, led by Chief Executive John Wilder, on Monday began a series of meetings with top investors on the merits of the buyout bid. The deal has encountered opposition from the company's largest shareholder, money manager Franklin Resources Inc. ( BEN.N ), which said the offer price was too low. TXU said it was scheduled to meet with Franklin Resources as part of the final push. In a presentation to investors, TXU said the buyout's 25 percent premium was meaningful and superior to alternative options, including a stand-alone plan that would separate the company into three distinct businesses. TXU's three core units are transmission, generation and retail electricity. Franklin Resources said last month it believed TXU's stock would have performed better since February, when it agreed to the buyout, if there had been no deal. Other shareholders say the price is fair and see no better options in the horizon, especially given the current turmoil in the credit markets. "All in all, it's a good deal for clients," said Dave Dreman of Dreman Value Management LLC, which owns about 3.8 million TXU shares, in a recent interview with Reuters. It is unlikely that shareholders would reject the deal unless a substantially higher offer emerged, he said. James Halloran of National City Private Client Group, which owns shares of TXU, said some of the drumbeating against the current offer was posturing to score up a better deal, but he downplayed the likelihood of another buyer materializing. "No one else is going to buy them as far as I can see," he told Reuters last week. The recent credit market problems also make it hard for an alternative buyer to obtain financing, even if one were interested, Halloran added. "Finding the wherewithal to get the deal done, even if you had the stomach for it, would be hard," Halloran said. If the $32 billion deal did not close, TXU said it expected to split into three stand-alone businesses, probably through a spinoff of its retail and transmission operations, because market, legislative and regulatory challenges undermine the integrated business model. TXU showcased a stark comparison between the company's stand-alone scenario and the buyout case. Utilizing a number of valuation methodologies, such as a discounted cash flow analysis which looks at the future profitability of a company, TXU said the buyout bid would provide a meaningful premium. It said a future premium in the stand-alone situation would be less likely. Before it was approached to go private, TXU said its management had been working with the board on a stand-alone plan. The company also contemplated reducing the number of new coal-fired units and a price cut for North Texas retail customers. TXU had been widely criticized and cast as a "dirty" power company for originally pushing an ambitious plan to build as many as 11 traditional coal-fired power plants in Texas. To gain support for the deal, the buying group influenced the company to cut its planned power plant build to three and also to reduce power prices.
