 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Midwest Air Group Inc. MEH.A, which had been fending off hostile suitor AirTran Holdings Inc. AAI.N, has accepted a higher bid of more than $400 million from private equity firm TPG Capital and Northwest Airlines Corp. NWA.N 

 TPG's $16-a-share offer includes a passive investment by No. 5 U.S. airline Northwest, which partners with regional carrier Midwest. AirTran, which had bid $15.75 per share in cash and stock for Midwest, said it would not raise its offer. "We have terminated negotiations and allowed our tender offer to expire," AirTran Chief Executive Joe Leonard said in a statement. "At this time, we will focus our efforts on AirTran's strategic plan." Midwest, known for its fresh-baked cookies on board, had steadfastly opposed AirTran's approach for months, setting up a Web site (www.savethecookie.com) in support of its bid to remain independent. The carrier's resistance, however, weakened in June after shareholders elected three board members nominated by AirTran. Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based Midwest entered into talks with AirTran at the end of July, but at the time said it would also speak with other potential buyers that had stepped forward. TPG's offer, which Midwest said was subject to a final value calculation but would probably exceed $400 million, represents a 12.5 percent premium to Midwest's closing share price of $14.23 on Friday on the American Stock Exchange. The transaction is not subject to financing conditions, TPG said in its offer letter to Midwest -- a key consideration given recent credit market turmoil that has created bumpy conditions for other private equity deals. Midwest said in a statement late on Sunday that it and TPG expected to sign a definitive merger agreement by Wednesday. TPG has a history of investing in airlines, including approaches earlier this year in the European market. Northwest said its investment, for an undisclosed amount, would facilitate the transaction, but added that it had no plans to participate in the management or control of Midwest if TPG succeeds in its takeover bid. AirTran, the No. 10 U.S. airline and operator of a hub in Atlanta, had hoped to combine Midwest's presence in the central United States with its strength on the East Coast. AirTran said that TPG's offer, given the passive investment from Northwest, could raise antitrust concerns, which could make it more difficult for the transaction to win regulatory approval. TPG, in its letter to Midwest, said it did not anticipate any issues in obtaining antitrust clearance or other regulatory approvals. Analysts have long said the industry needed consolidation to reduce excess capacity so airlines can raise fares and derive savings from combining their operations. But while TPG may be more aggressive in cutting Midwest's capacity, the deal is not likely to make much impact on the industry in terms of reducing supply or spurring deal-making, said JPMorgan analyst Jamie Baker. "Northwest's passive stake in TPG Capital's offer for Midwest doesn't kick start long-awaited consolidation, in our view, which frankly is too bad," Baker said in a note. Northwest said a code-sharing agreement with Midwest will remain in place, and post-merger the two airlines could explore cost reductions such as joint fuel purchasing.
