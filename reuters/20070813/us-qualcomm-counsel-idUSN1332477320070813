 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc ( QCOM.O ) General Counsel Lou Lupin has resigned, the company said on Monday, after the wireless chip supplier was dealt several legal setbacks in its dispute with rival Broadcom Corp. ( BRCM.O ). 

 Shares in Qualcomm, which also faces a U.S. government ban on importing some wireless phones using its chips, rose as much as 4 percent after the news. The company, which announced the move on the eve of a key legal hearing over its patent infringement case with Broadcom, said legal counsel Carol Lam will act as general counsel while it conducts a search for a permanent successor to Lupin. Qualcomm said that Lupin decided to resign for personal reasons, without elaborating. The company credited him with playing a major role in its technology licensing program, including negotiating licensing deals. Oppenheimer analyst Lawrence Harris said that Lupin had provided years of excellent service since he joined Qualcomm as senior legal counsel in 1995, but investors were hopeful that a change could help solve Qualcomm's legal woes. "The company did experience a few setbacks last week ... the timing is probably indicative," said Harris. "When you have change in management, sometimes you have the opportunity to bring in some new perspective." But JPMorgan analyst Ehud Gelblum said the resignation of Lupin, who he described as the mastermind behind the company's royalty business and current legal strategy, was "distinctly bad news for the company." "We strongly do not believe that a change of general counsel will be able to turn (Qualcomm's) fortunes," he said in a note to clients. Gelblum rates the shares as "neutral." If Lupin did resign of his own accord, it might imply that he was losing faith in the company's ability to win its legal battles, Gelblum said. CONCEALED DOCUMENTS In one patent case brought by Broadcom, a federal judge ruled last week that Qualcomm had waived its rights to enforce two patents asserted against Broadcom because it had concealed documents and patents. Qualcomm said it would appeal. Gelblum said that this case could be a sign of additional misconduct at the company, "compromising Lupin's ability to defend many of the lawsuits Qualcomm is currently in." Qualcomm did not immediately respond to requests for an interview with Lupin. On Tuesday, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California is scheduled to hear Broadcom's request for a permanent injunction against Qualcomm over three patents that the court ruled Qualcomm had infringed in another case. James Selna, a judge at the Santa Ana, California court, on Friday tentatively doubled Broadcom's award of $19.64 million in damages from Qualcomm, first issued in May for that case. In yet another patent infringement case, the U.S. International Trade Commission on June 7 banned the U.S. sale of some phones using Qualcomm chips found to infringe a Broadcom patent. Last week, the Bush administration said it would uphold the ban after a 60-day review of the decision, which Qualcomm is appealing. Aside from its patent infringement battles with Broadcom, Qualcomm is also engaged in a bitter dispute with Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ) after the companies failed to reach an agreement before their technology license deal expired early in April. Qualcomm said last week it was no closer to a pact with Nokia, the No. 1 mobile phone maker, and expected arbitration proceedings to begin soon. "Perhaps this will lead to progress in the discussions with Qualcomm and Nokia," Harris said about Lupin's departure. Qualcomm shares rose $1.05, or 2.77 percent, at $38.94 on Nasdaq at mid-afternoon, after trading as high as $39.65. (Additional reporting by  Franklin Paul )
