 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Dutch insurer Aegon NV ( AEGN.AS ) ( AEG.N ) said on Monday it agreed to buy Merrill Lynch Life Insurance Co. and ML Life Insurance Co. of New York for $1.3 billion in cash to boost its sales of variable annuities and distribution. 

 Aegon said the transaction is expected to close before the end of the fourth quarter. Aegon said it will form a strategic relationship with Merrill in insurance and investment products and that Aegon's Transamerica companies will support Merrill's financial adviser network. The two companies being acquired had $800 million of variable annuity sales in 2006, and $10 billion of variable annuity assets at year-end 2006, and the transaction will place Aegon in the top ten of variable annuities sellers in the broker-dealer segment globally. Aegon said it expects the acquisition to have a marginally positive effect on earnings per share. Merrill Lynch MER.N expects to record a significant gain on the sale during the fourth quarter of 2007 and anticipates the transaction will provide a slight boost to earnings per share.
