 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - AnnTaylor Stores Corp. ( ANN.N ) said on Monday that former Jones Apparel Group ( JNY.N ) executive Mark Mendelson would join the clothing retailer as president of a new business that it did not describe. 

 Shares of AnnTaylor, which operates the Ann Taylor and LOFT chains, rose more than 5 percent. Mendelson, who worked at Ann Taylor in the early 1990s, will lead a new business that the company plans to launch in fall 2008. Earlier on Monday, The New York Times reported that the new concept was a casual clothing chain targeting baby boomers, but an AnnTaylor spokeswoman was not immediately available to confirm that. Other apparel companies that target older consumers include Talbots Inc. TLB.N, Coldwater Creek Inc. ( CWTR.O ) and Chico's FAS Inc. ( CHS.N ) AnnTaylor has reported declines in monthly same-store sales during nine out of the last 10 months, due in part to merchandise assortments at the more casual LOFT chain that Chief Executive Kay Krill has said lacked enough color. AnnTaylor shares were up $1.53, or 5.4 percent, at $29.97 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by  Martinne Geller )
