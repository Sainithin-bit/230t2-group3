 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - H&R Block Inc. ( HRB.N ), facing a proxy battle from activist investor Richard Breeden, said on Monday its board of directors voted to declassify the board, so that directors will be up for election every year rather than every three years. 

 The largest U.S. tax preparer said it intends to hold a special meeting before year-end to seek shareholder approval of the change, which would take effect starting with its 2008 annual meeting. If approved, directors would be required to resign from any portion of their terms extending beyond that meeting. H&R Block Chief Executive Mark Ernst said the change would enhance corporate governance and followed talks with several of the Kansas City, Missouri-based company's largest shareholders. Breeden has proposed that he and two associates fill the three board seats, out of a total of 11, up for election at H&R Block's annual meeting on September 6. His firm, Breeden Capital Management LLC, has said it owns 1.84 percent of H&R Block's shares. It has argued that management has strayed beyond tax preparation into such areas as subprime mortgage lending, hurting the company's share price. Breeden is a former chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Calls to his office in Greenwich, Connecticut, were not answered. An outside spokeswoman for the firm did not immediately return a call seeking comment. H&R Block shares closed Friday at $19.70 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel)
