 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Sears Holdings Corp. ( SHLD.O ) on Monday reported declining quarterly same-store sales at its Kmart and Sears stores and tightened the range of its earnings outlook, citing problems including the housing market slowdown. 

 The company said same-store sales for the second quarter that ended on August 4 had fallen 3.8 percent at Kmart and 4.3 percent at Sears. Sales fell across most categories at Kmart, while at Sears, declines were partially offset by increases in consumer electronics, women's apparel and footwear. Sears Holdings said it expects second-quarter net income of $170 million to $185 million, or $1.13 to $1.23 per share. It had earlier forecast a range of $160 million to $200 million. Citing the effect of share buybacks through the end of the quarter, Sears cut its quarterly cash outlook, saying it expects to report $2.0 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of the second quarter, excluding Sears Canada, down from a prior forecast of $2.8 billion. The company also said its board of directors has approved buying back up to $1.5 billion in company stock, in addition to the $19 million remaining under previous authorizations. "While we recognize the housing market slowdown and other economic pressures have presented a noticeable headwind to the business, we are disappointed with our second-quarter results," Sears Chief Executive Aylwin Lewis said.
