 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Food distributor Sysco Corp. ( SYY.N ) said on Monday quarterly earnings rose, helped by increased sales. 

 The company, which supplies food and other products to restaurants, cafeterias and other food sellers, reported net earnings of $303.4 million, or 49 cents per share, for the fiscal fourth quarter ended June 30, up from $254.1 million, or 41 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts were expecting the company to earn 46 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Sysco said quarterly sales rose 8.5 percent $9.23 billion, above analysts' expectation of $9.137 billion. The company is targeting long-term annual sales growth of 7 to 9 percent, excluding the impact of major acquisitions, and expects low-to mid-double digit annualized earnings per share growth. Analysts expected Sysco to earn a profit of $1.78 per share on revenue of $37.83 billion for 2008, according to Reuters Estimates.
