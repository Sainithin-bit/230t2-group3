 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve Bank of New York will evaluate whether it needs to inject additional cash into the banking system at its normal operating time of 9:30 a.m. on Monday, the New York Fed said in an unusual statement on its Web site. 

 "In addition, the (Trading) Desk stands ready to conduct additional operations later in the day as needed," the statement said. It is not typical for the New York Fed to issue a statement about its open market operations on its Web site. Asked what prompted the statement, a New York Fed spokesman declined to comment. On Friday, the Fed added $38 billion of temporary reserves to the banking system in three operations, as some other major global central banks also added liquidity, to loosen credit conditions and calm jittery markets. "The desk will evaluate whether it needs to conduct operations at its normal operating time of 9:30 a.m.," the statement said. Earlier on Monday, the European Central Bank injected 47.67 billion euros ($65.12 billion) in the euro-zone money markets while the Bank of Japan pumped 600 billion yen ($5.1 billion) into the banking system.
