 (Reuters) - The French state on Monday evening allocated a first 10.5 billion euros ($14.12 billion) in capital to six French banks in a bid to shore up their solvency ratios in the light of the credit crisis. Following are details: 

 * The SFFE fund for the recapitalization of the economy was created on October 13 and 40 billion euros was earmarked for bank recapitalization. The fund will borrow money on capital markets with a state guarantee. * Economy Minister Christine Lagarde on Monday allocated a first 10.5 billion euros tranche and said that if needed the same amount would be available in 2009. * The banks will issue subordinated bonds to the state that will carry an interested rate of at least 400 basis points above the risk-free market rate. * Banque Populaire plans to issue 950 million euros in junior paper to the state, BNP Paribas ( BNPP.PA ) 2.55 billion, Caisse d'Epargne 1.1 billion, Credit Agricole ( CAGR.PA ) 3 billion, Credit Mutuel 1.2 billion and Societe Generale ( SOGN.PA ) 1.7 billion. * The pact will be submitted to the European Commission for approval. * The banks will have to adopt 'ethical' rules for remuneration with a ceiling to departure bonuses and a ban on golden parachutes for failed executives. * The banks will have to sign individual agreements with the state committing them to assist people with problems with real estate bridge loans and to facilitate financing of small and medium-sized companies. * The French banking association said it aimed to increase the amount of outstanding credit to households, small and medium-sized firms and local authorities by 3 to 4 percent. * The Bank of France and the local 'prefect' state representatives will monitor the financing of the economy.
