 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Chemical maker DuPont Co ( DD.N ) reported lower third-quarter earnings on Tuesday, hurt by hurricane-related charges and lower volume shipments, and cut its full-year forecast. 

 In recent quarters, the slump in the U.S. housing and automotive markets has hurt the company, whose products range from seeds and paints to electronics and protective gear. Net income in the quarter fell to $367 million, or 40 cents a share, from $526 million, or 56 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding a charge for plant damage, lost inventory and other problems from the hurricanes, the company earned 56 cents a share, down from 59 cents a year earlier. Revenue rose 9.3 percent to $7.3 billion, largely because of higher pricing in all regions. Analysts on average had forecast earnings of 51 cents a share on revenue of $7.07 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. DuPont lowered its full-year earnings outlook to $3.25 to $3.30 per share. It previously had forecast $3.45 to $3.55, and Wall Street had been expecting $3.49. The outlook reflects weakening demand in North American and Western European markets, DuPont said in a statement. In light trading before the market opened, shares of the Wilmington, Delaware-based company were down nearly 2 percent at $35.50. At Monday's close, the stock had fallen more than 30 percent over the last six months. (Reporting by  Euan Rocha ; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn and Steve Orlofsky)
