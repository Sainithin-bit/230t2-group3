 SEOUL  (Reuters) - South Korea's President Lee Myung-bak said on Tuesday a looming global downturn had made his country's economic challenges graver than during the Asian financial crisis a decade ago. 

 The fourth biggest economy in Asia has looked especially exposed to the financial turmoil, with the government at the weekend announcing a $130 billion rescue for its financial system and later on Tuesday will unveil plans to help its wilting construction industry. "The overall situation is more serious than the 1997 crisis. Back then it was an Asian crisis but today the entire world economy is at risk," a presidential spokesman quoted Lee as saying during a cabinet meeting. "It's not like any recovery of our own means we will have escaped the effects of the (global) crisis," Lee said. His remarks came as South Korea's financial markets looked to be regaining their composure after some of the most volatile price swings since the 1997/98 Asian financial crisis almost pushed South Korea into default. "The impact from the global risk is fading, but Korean markets are now trapped with the local economy's own risks such as the construction sector and weaker fund inflow," said Kim Hak-kyun, an analyst at Korea Investment & Securities. Markets were relatively steady in morning trading as investors responded to global financial support and awaited details of how the government would help the construction industry, whose woes risk causing wider damage to the economy. VULNERABLE WON By 0229 the Korea Composite Stock Price Index was up 0.26 percent at 1,210.83 points, giving up an early 2 percent gain, while the won currency stood at 1,322.8/6.1 versus the dollar, 0.66 pct lower than Monday's local close of 1,315. The weak showing in the won, one of Asia's worst performing currencies with a 30 percent decline so far this year, highlighted investor concerns that it might yet be vulnerable to aftershocks from the worldwide financial meltdown. "Global financial markets are stabilizing, helped by coordination by the world's financial authorities. But with only those measures, fundamental concerns over the sluggish economy and financial crisis will not disappear," said an analyst at a local futures firm. Builders, heavily indebted to the banks, are in line for a 12 trillion won ($9.2 billion) rescue package that would include the government buying land and unsold new homes and helping firms roll over maturing debt, a local newspaper said. Seoul's Ministry of Strategy and Finance told reporters on Tuesday it would announce measures to help the construction industry at 0700 GMT, but gave no details. The measures would come swiftly after South Korea piled into the global round of financial support measures on Sunday, promising a $130 billion bundle of foreign debt guarantees and liquidity provisions. The government opened the taps on the loan guarantees earlier on Tuesday, spreading out the promised $100 billion worth among 18 local banks, including state-owned Korea Development Bank and Woori Bank. Also making good on promises to ensure liquidity in South Korean financial markets the central bank said it had provided $1.52 billion out of a planned $2.5 billion in three month swap deals to local banks. The Bank of Korea said last week it would supply dollars into the local swap market to help ease persistent dollar-funding shortages amid the global financial crisis.
