 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wachovia Bank WVBKL.PK, beset by credit woes and being taken over by Wells Fargo & Co ( WFC.N ), has sued a land developer and some of the largest U.S. homebuilders, accusing them of defaulting over loans on a huge planned community near Las Vegas. 

 In the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan on October 10, Wachovia said Focus Kyle Group LLC, along with 10 builders, failed to make payments and "failed to perform its obligation to commence, continue and complete the development and construction of improvements on the project." The development near Las Vegas is not identified in the lawsuit, but earlier this year, two housing projects involving the same builders received default notices on about $765 million in debt. The developments were Inspirada and Kyle Cannon Gateway. The court document made public on Tuesday describes a U.S. Bureau of Land Management land auction for 1,712 acres of underdeveloped land in Las Vegas, Nevada, that fetched a winning bid of $510 million. Kyle Cannon Gateway was also described as being about 1,700 acres. Focus owns 15.5 percent of Inspirada and 23 percent of Kyle Cannon Gateway. Both developments were expected to have more than 13,000 homes and parkland. The lawsuit said a consortium was organized in 2005 to buy the property and to plan and build the community infrastructure so that its members could buy the lots, build homes and other improvements for sale to the public. Wachovia arranged $565 million in credit facilities and acted as the administrative agent. The bank said it is seeking guaranteed payments from the companies and costs, all estimated to exceed $358 million, according to the complaint. Aside from the Kyle Group and its CEO, John Ritter, the other defendants are Toll Brothers Inc ( TOL.N ), KB Home ( KBH.N ) KB Home Nevada Inc, Meritage Homes Corp ( MTH.N ), Pulte Homes Inc ( PHM.N ), Lennar Corp ( LEN.N ), Ryland Group Inc ( RYL.N ), Ryland Homes Nevada, MTH Homes Nevada, PN II Inc and Alameda Investments LLC. Representatives of the companies could not immediately be reached for comment. (Editing by  Gary Hill )
