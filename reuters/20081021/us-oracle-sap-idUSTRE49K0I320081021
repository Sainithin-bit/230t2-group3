 BOSTON  (Reuters) - A U.S. federal judge told Oracle Corp to propose a financial settlement in a lawsuit that the software giant filed against rival SAP AG in which Oracle has claimed that damages may top $1 billion. 

 Oracle filed the claim against the German software maker in March 2007, accusing SAP's U.S.-based TomorrowNow services unit of illegally using customer log-ins to steal copyrighted materials from Oracle's website. Federal Judge Joseph Spero asked Redwood City, California-based Oracle to tell SAP how much money it wants to settle the case by February 13. The German software maker will have until February 18 to come up with a counter offer, according to the order that was issued in the U.S. District Court in San Francisco on Monday. Oracle spokeswoman Deborah Hellinger declined comment. SAP spokesman Saswato Das said his company would cooperate with the court's request. California courts regularly require parties in civil lawsuits attempt to settle before they go to court. SAP had disclosed in July 2007 that TomorrowNow employees made "some inappropriate downloads" of materials from Oracle's website. But SAP officials have repeatedly declined to elaborate on that comment, saying the facts will be reviewed by the court. SAP is in the process of shutting down TomorrowNow after an unsuccessful bid to sell the company. (Reporting by  Jim Finkle , Editing by Ben Tan)
