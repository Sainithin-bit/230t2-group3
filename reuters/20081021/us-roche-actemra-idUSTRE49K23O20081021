 ZURICH  (Reuters) - Roche Holding AG ( ROG.VX ) is still discussing what additional information is required for approval of its Actemra rheumatoid arthritis drug with U.S. regulators, the Swiss company said on Tuesday. 

 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) last month requested more information relating to the manufacturing of Actemra and other issues such as final labeling, delaying approval for the potential billion-dollar seller. "The talks continue. We've given some more data back to the FDA and we're in regular contact with them to try and settle the outstanding issues and be able to move forward," William Burns, head of Roche's pharmaceuticals unit, told reporters after the company reported nine-month sales.
