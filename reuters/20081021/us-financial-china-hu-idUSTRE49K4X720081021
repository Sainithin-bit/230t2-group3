 BEIJING  (Reuters) - China hopes U.S. steps to calm its financial markets will have their desired effect soon to prevent the financial crisis from spreading, state media on Tuesday cited President Hu Jintao as telling George W. Bush. 

 Hu, speaking to U.S. President Bush by telephone, said China was willing to work with other countries to tackle the world's financial problems, the official Xinhua news agency said. "We have noticed the hard work of the U.S. government in stabilizing its domestic financial markets, and hope the effects of these measures can been seen as soon as possible, to prevent the crisis spreading further through the economy," it paraphrased Hu as saying. China has taken a series of steps to deal with the crisis, maintain market and financial stability and ensure the economy keeps growing at a stable and fairly rapid clip, Hu said. "The Chinese government will continue to have a responsible attitude toward its own people and the people of other countries, closely cooperate with the international community and together maintain the financial stability of the world economy," Hu added. Xinhua paraphrased Bush as telling Hu that the United States was willing to work with the rest of the world to look at ways of addressing the crisis. The Chinese government has repeatedly voiced confidence that it can keep its economy and financial markets stable in the face of the global meltdown. It has also said it is willing to work with other countries to help tackle the crisis. (Reporting by  Ben Blanchard ; Editing by Jon Loades-Carter)
