 BEIJING  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ), the world's largest retailer, has achieved annual sales growth in China of at least 25 percent and this strong growth will continue, a company executive said on Tuesday. 

 "If you look at the past history of Wal-Mart growth here, it's very like 25, 30 plus percent a year," Shawn Gray, vice president of China operations, told reporters in Beijing. "Wal-Mart is committed to China, and the growth will continue," he said. Gray said he expected double-digit growth this year. Gray, speaking ahead of a company-sponsored conference, did not give a dollar figure for the company's current China sales or say what portion of global sales come from its more than 100 stores in the country. The giant discount retailer previously reported its second quarter profit jumped 17 percent. Although the group forecast current quarter results could miss estimates amid global economic turmoil, analysts said it was well positioned to gain market share. Wal-Mart raised its full-year forecast, however, on the strength of second-quarter results as shoppers seek low prices on everything from food to healthcare products and electronics. Wal-Mart operates about 6,000 stores worldwide, including more than 3,000 stores in 13 countries outside the United States, and is starting to shift investment away from its saturated home base. That expansion is mirrored by global rivals, including France's Carrefour ( CARR.PA ) and Britain's Tesco ( TSCO.L ). ($=6.83 yuan) (Reporting by  Eadie Chen ; Writing by  Kirby Chien )
