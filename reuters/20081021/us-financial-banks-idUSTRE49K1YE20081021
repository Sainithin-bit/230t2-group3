 PARIS  (Reuters) - France's banks won some respite from the ravages of the financial crisis through a 10.5 billion-euro ($13.91 billion) state cash injection, although analysts said the banks may yet need more help. 

 French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde said late on Monday the government would lend the money to the banks before the end of the year. The French state was ready to lend the same amount to banks again in 2009, she added. "It's a well-received move by the government. It gives the banks a bit of oxygen," said GSD Gestion fund manager Christophe Gautier. Shares in France's top banks rose sharply on Tuesday following the government's announcement, helping them recover from steep falls on Monday. Credit Agricole ( CAGR.PA ), the country's top retail bank, surged 13 percent and was the top gainer on France's benchmark CAC-40  .FCHI  index. BNP Paribas ( BNPP.PA ), France's biggest bank by market capitalization, was up 8 percent. Societe Generale ( SOGN.PA ), which at one stage on Monday fell 10 percent due to concerns over its capital position, rose 11 percent. The French banks all outperformed a 1.3 percent gain in the DJ Stoxx European banking index .SX7P. "(This is) a positive first step for French banks which should reassure markets, although we think this is just the first step and a second round is due in the not so distant future," Oddo Securities analysts wrote in a note. The capital position of French banks had been in the spotlight after Lagarde said earlier this month she wanted them to be able to increase their Tier 1 capital ratio to around 9 percent, as their counterparts in Britain had done. LOW VISIBILITY The move comes a week after President Nicolas Sarkozy said France had earmarked 360 billion euros as part of an international effort to help banks survive the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression almost 80 years ago. Spain's government also took steps to shore up its banks on Monday, approving emergency measures including the creation of a fund of up to 50 billion euros to acquire high quality bank assets. On Sunday, the Dutch government gave a 10 billion-euro cash injection to ING ( ING.AS ), while earlier this month Britain injected 37 billion pounds into three of its biggest banks to strengthen their financial position. France agreed on Monday to subscribe to subordinated debt issued by Credit Agricole for 3 billion euros, BNP Paribas for 2.55 billion, Societe Generale for 1.7 billion euros, and for 1.2 billion by Credit Mutuel. It will also lend 1.1 billion to Caisse d'Epargne and 950 million to Caisse d'Epargne's merger partner, Banque Populaire. The amounts are in line with the size of the banks. Oddo Securities said the move would lift the Tier 1 ratio of the French banks to around 8.9 percent, while brokerage CM-CIC Securities estimated it would raise the ratio to 8.5 to 9 percent. However, some fund managers said they would still steer clear of the financial sector due to the problems caused by the credit crisis, which began when banks found themselves exposed to losses in the U.S. housing market. "There's still a lack of visibility in the banking sector," said Laurent Dobler, fund manager at French firm Comgest SA. Comgest holds around 6 billion euros of assets under management but does not own any French bank stocks. (Editing by  Marcel Michelson  and Quentin Bryar)
