 SEOUL  (Reuters) - President Lee Myung-bak said on Tuesday South Korea's economic situation is more serious than during the Asian financial crisis 10 years ago, because of a looming global economic recession, local media reported. 

 "The overall situation is more serious than the 1997 crisis. Back then it was an Asian crisis but today the entire world economy is at risk," Lee was quoted as saying by presidential spokesman Lee Dong-kwan, according to Yonhap. "It's not like any recovery of own means we will have escaped the effects of the (global) crisis," Lee said. He made the remarks during a cabinet meeting.
