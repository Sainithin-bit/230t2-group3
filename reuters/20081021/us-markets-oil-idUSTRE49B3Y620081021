 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oil prices tumbled 4 percent on Tuesday amid worries that a global recession would crush fuel demand, limiting the impact of any supply cuts by OPEC. 

 U.S. crude for November delivery, which expired on Tuesday, settled down $3.36 at $70.89 a barrel. London Brent crude settled down $2.31 at $69.72 a barrel. The slide came as U.S. stocks fell on concern that earnings could be driven down by slower consumer demand. "Crude prices are down on demand consideration, with weakness being stoked by bearish economic data," said Kyle Cooper, director of research at IAF Advisors. U.S. weekly retail gasoline demand to October 17 fell 6.4 percent year-on-year, Mastercard Advisors said Tuesday, though it rose compared with the previous week. Total Asian demand for West African crude fell 27 percent to 918,000 barrels per day in November from 1.25 million bpd in October as demand from India, Indonesia and Taiwan decreased, according to traders. The price of oil has slid 50 percent since hitting a record high above $147 in mid-July. The fall came as demand slumped in the United States, the world's largest energy consumer, and other industrial countries hit by the credit crisis. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries was due to meet in Vienna on Friday and was expected to reduce output to defend prices and temper the effects of the financial crisis. OPEC could face an intense debate on how much oil members should take off global markets as they balance their price needs against risks to a fragile world economy. Iran has said a drop in demand could push OPEC to cut output by 2 million to 2.5 million bpd, while other members have said a smaller cut may be needed. OPEC Secretary General Abdullah al-Badri has led the call for output cuts, telling reporters Tuesday that the world would face an over-supply of oil next year, if leading producers fail to cut supply. "If things stay as they are, there will be a huge excess of supply in 2009," Badri said. The International Energy Agency, which advises industrial countries, has said an OPEC output cut could prolong a global economic slowdown. MARKETS SLIDE Oil and commodities have tracked equity markets in the past few weeks as the financial crisis hit the demand outlook. U.S. stocks fell on Tuesday amid concerns the global economy might be sliding toward recession. European shares gave up early gains that had followed a rise in U.S. stock markets on Monday. "I think (oil prices) moved in line with equities yesterday and are now pulling back, using stock markets as a barometer for demand," said Christopher Bellew of Bache Commodities. Japan and France extended more help to banks, the IMF prepared to intervene in trouble spots around the world and the Fed devised a new plan to inject liquidity into money markets to curb the worldwide financial crisis. U.S. crude oil inventories probably rose 2.6 million barrels last week, an updated Reuters poll showed ahead of U.S. government energy data due on Wednesday. The poll also showed forecasts for a 100,000-barrel rise in distillate inventories, which include heating oil and diesel, and a gain of 2.8 million barrels in gasoline supplies.
