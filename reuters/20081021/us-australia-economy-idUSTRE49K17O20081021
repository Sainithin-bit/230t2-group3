 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Australia's central bank on Tuesday sounded cautiously optimistic the country would dodge recession thanks to aggressive cuts in interest rates, a fillip of fiscal stimulus and a fall in the local dollar. 

 Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Governor Glenn Stevens also said drastic steps by central banks to inject cash into log-jammed credit markets and support stressed banks, looked to have eased the risk of a "global catastrophe." But he ducked out of a growing spat over the Australian government's guarantee of bank deposits, which critics say is sucking funds out of the many lenders without a guarantee, such as mortgage funds and foreign banks. Investors focused on the governor's emphasis on recent positive developments for the Australian economy, and whether they might limit how far interest rates would fall. "Financial markets should continue to pare back their expectations for further aggressive cuts from the RBA," said Su-Lin Ong, senior economist at RBC Capital Markets. She still expects an easing of 50 basis points in November, but a more gradual pace from then on. The central bank slashed its cash rate by 100 basis points to 6.0 percent this month, the biggest cut in 16 years, which was quickly followed by a government stimulus worth A$10.4 billion ($7.3 billion), equal to about 0.9 percent of economic output. Meanwhile, a 20 percent drop in the trade weighted value of the Australian dollar in the past couple of months would underpin exports and resource earnings. "These changes will act to lessen the extent of the likely slowdown in Australia's economy, even as global forces work the other way," Stevens told business leaders in a speech. Signs of economic stress were evident on Tuesday in a steep 8.2 percent fall in September vehicle sales from a year earlier. And electrical and furniture retailer Harvey Norman reported a bruising 5.8 percent sales drop in the month to mid-October Yet, some sectors were benefiting from consumers' new-found frugality. Supermarket giant Woolworths saw sales growth accelerate to a brisk 9.6 percent in the 14 weeks to Oct 5, as people shopped for food and liquor instead of going out to eat. "People are out there still spending," Chief Executive Michael Luscombe told a media briefing. PARSING THE GUARANTEE National Australia Bank, the country's biggest lender, also defied the pessimists, despite reporting a 28 percent drop in half-year profits and an escalation of bad debts. Bad loan provisions more than quadrupled, though at A$1.76 billion they were still minor compared to the losses suffered by banks in the United States and Europe, and the bank's share price surged to 7.3 percent, outperforming the rest of the market. However, the government decision to fully guarantee A$600-A$700 billion ($423-$493 billion) of deposits at Australian-regulated banks has created headaches for some non-bank institutions. The move had lowered funding costs for the four major domestic banks and allowed them to trim mortgage rates by between 20 to 25 basis points in the past few days, further supporting the economy independently of the central bank. It also threatened to suck cash out of lenders not covered by the guarantee, such as mortgage funds and foreign banks. A report in the Australian newspaper claimed Stevens had warned the government that its plan was causing serious dislocations in the financial system and recommended a cap on deposits, much like the U.S. and UK schemes. The government denied the report, saying all financial regulators had backed the decision, but it did not seem confident enough to lift a ban on the short-selling of financial shares. Australia's securities watchdog said the ban would continue until January 27 while the ban on covered short-selling of non-financial stocks would be extended for a month to November 19. "The financial markets are still fragile, so we feel the reopening of covered short sales should be done in stages and in a measured way over an extended period," Australian Securities and Investments Commission Chairman Tony D'Aloisio said.
