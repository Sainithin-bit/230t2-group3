 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. chemical makers DuPont Co ( DD.N ) and Celanese Corp ( CE.N ) cut their 2008 earnings forecasts in light of slowing global economic conditions, sending their shares lower and overshadowing better-than-expected third-quarter results. 

 The slump in the U.S. housing and automotive markets has hurt DuPont and Celanese, as both companies manufacture a range of products that are used in both sectors. Strong demand growth in Asia has buoyed both companies in recent quarters, but DuPont and Celanese acknowledged that Asia is being affected by the turmoil in global financial markets and growth in the region is showing signs of slowing down. Shares of DuPont, which fell 6.66 percent to $33.76, were among the biggest losers on the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI , while those of Celanese fell 25.8 percent to $14.61, both on the New York Stock Exchange at mid-afternoon. "The guidance is quite sobering and likely marks the first of many cautious outlooks to come in the chemical industry," said Goldman analyst Robert Koort, commenting on DuPont's forecast in a note to clients. The weaker-than-expected forecasts from both DuPont and Celanese also weighed on the rest of the chemical sector and dragged the Standard & Poor's Chemicals Index .GSPPM down 4 percent on the day. Increasing raw material, energy and transportation costs have weighed on the sector through the first half of 2008, but the sharp pullback in crude oil and natural gas prices is likely to ease the cost pressure on U.S. chemical makers in the months ahead. However, analysts caution that the strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the euro, Brazilian real and other Asian currencies will erode the foreign exchange gains that U.S. chemical makers have enjoyed in recent quarters. DuPont posted third-quarter net income of $367 million, or 40 cents a share, down from $526 million, or 56 cents a share, a year earlier. Hurricanes Gustav and Ike, which slammed the U.S. Gulf coast in September, caused significant damage at a large DuPont facility in Orange, Texas. Excluding a charge related to hurricane damage, DuPont earned 56 cents a share, down from 59 cents a year earlier. Wall Street was expecting earnings of 51 cents a share. "DuPont saw substantial weakness in North America, exacerbated by the hurricane effects this quarter," said Morningstar analyst Ben Johnson. "This was offset by strength in (its agricultural unit) and some of the overseas markets." DuPont's revenue rose 9.3 percent to $7.3 billion, largely because of higher pricing in all regions. Analysts, on average, had forecast revenue of $7.07 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. DuPont, which makes products that range from seeds and paints to electronics and protective gear, lowered its 2008 earnings outlook to $3.25 to $3.30 per share. It previously had forecast $3.45 to $3.55, and Wall Street had been expecting $3.49. "It's almost like any turbulent storm -- this is the lightning and thunder right now, and we don't see where things are going to settle out," DuPont Chief Executive Charles Holliday said of current market conditions. Celanese posted third-quarter net income of $158 million, or 97 cents a share, up from a year-ago profit of $128 million, or 76 cents a share. Excluding items, quarterly earnings were 78 cents a share, up from 73 cents a share, a year earlier. Quarterly revenue rose 15.9 percent to $1.82 billion. Analysts, on average, had forecast earnings of 77 cents a share on revenue of $1.70 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Excluding items, the company now expects full-year 2008 earnings of $3.40 to $3.55 a share, down from a prior forecast of $3.60 to $3.85 a share. Wall Street had been expecting earnings of $3.82 a share. Goldman Sachs analyst Edlain Rodriguez said Celanese's large Asian exposure, which has been a source of strength, is showing signs of cracking. "Celanese is exposed to all aspects of the Chinese economy, and both the export-oriented markets and the internal markets are being hit," said Rodriguez in a note to clients.
