 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve on Tuesday announced a new facility to restore lending by money market mutual funds and money market investors. 

 The announcement is one of series of measures by the Fed and the Treasury Department to bolster money market funds -- a mainstay of conservative investors -- after shares in The Reserve Primary Fund fell below $1.00 on September 16. The fund's "breaking the buck" unleashed a flood of redemptions in money market mutual funds. Some details about the newest facility: * To be named the Money Market Investor Funding Facility (MMIFF); * Will operate through five special purpose vehicles funded by the New York Fed, each of which will be made up of ten institutions; * Will be authorized to buy $600 billion of U.S. dollar-denominated certificates of deposit and commercial paper issued by highly rated financial institutions and having remaining maturities of 90 days or less; * Fed to provide senior financing up to 90 percent, or as much as $540 billion; * Conduits will be sponsored and managed by JPMorgan Chase; * Complements a facility announced October 27 to fund purchases of commercial paper and one unveiled September 19 to lend to banks to buy asset-backed commercial paper from money market mutual funds; * Facility is aimed at taxable funds, not tax-exempt funds; * Launch date to be announced by Fed in several days.
