 RIYADH/DUBAI  (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia poured up to $3 billion into its banking system to ease tight conditions, bankers said on Tuesday, as Gulf Arab policymakers prepared to discuss a coordinated response to the global economic crisis. 

 Top oil exporter Saudi Arabia and five other members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), which is preparing for monetary union, have responded separately so far to the world's worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. This week's meeting will follow a call from Saudi Arabia's highest economic body for Gulf states to look at how they can coordinate their policies as Western economies head for a likely recession, threatening to put the brakes on a regional economic boom. Gulf central bank governors and finance ministers will meet in Riyadh on October 25 to explore how to cope with the global downturn, Gulf sources said, as oil prices have fallen by almost half in three months and banks suffer from a credit crunch. "Most Gulf central banks have already started moving in some way or the other. If they sit and discuss it they can come out with formulated ideas," said Monica Malik, regional economist at EFG-Hermes." SAUDI LENDS A HAND Trying to boost confidence in their banking sectors, Gulf central banks and governments have guaranteed bank deposits, eased lending restrictions, set up emergency funds to bring down interbank rates and poured money into ailing stock markets. The Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) took the latest step to defrost interbank lending, pouring between $2 billion and $3 billion in the form of deposits with banks on Monday to ease liquidity pressures, bankers said. The central bank also pumped money into banks on Tuesday, they said. Saudi interbank rates eased after the move, with the three-month rate falling to 4.6375 percent from 4.65125 percent. "They are doing this for growth reasons, knowing that 2009 will be a slower year amid a context where the availability of credit globally is tightening and where domestic rates are at levels that are choking private sector growth," said John Sfakianakis, chief economist at SABB bank, HSBC's Saudi affiliate. Banks in the United Arab Emirates were still waiting on Tuesday for details of how the government would inject 70 billion dirhams ($19 billion) into the banking system, probably in the form of long-term deposits. SHOCKWAVES The global financial crisis has hit the Gulf region after six years of high oil prices allowed state and private investors to funnel billions of dollars into industry and infrastructure projects. Banks are now struggling to finance these projects, leading economists and policymakers to expect project delays and cancellations. "It is normal that we be affected by what is happening in global markets," UAE Minister of Economy Sultan bin Saeed al-Mansouri said. "But there are elements of confidence and protection that are relevant to the particulars of our economy and its diverse base of income," he said in remarks reported by the daily Emarat al-Youm. The UAE, the second-largest Arab economy, was reviewing its economic policies to devise a three- to five-year plan that takes into consideration a global recession, Mansouri said, according to the Dubai state-owned daily. Economists have scaled back their economic growth forecasts for the Gulf region due to waning global energy demand and likely oil output cuts by producers' group OPEC. The Riyadh meeting will happen the day after OPEC holds its own emergency summit on oil prices, which have tumbled since hitting record highs above $147 a barrel.
