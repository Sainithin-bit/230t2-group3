 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan stepped up its crisis management on Tuesday, as the government and ruling coalition lawmakers sought to hammer out an income tax cut of 2 trillion yen as well as a scheme to recapitalize banks. 

 The government signaled a willingness to broaden its bank bailout scheme to cover the country's biggest banks, although most analysts think Japanese "megabanks," relatively unscathed in the credit crisis, will not need such capital injections. The secretary-general of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, Hiroyuki Hosoda, said the ruling coalition is studying an income tax cut of about 2 trillion yen as a part of an additional economic stimulus package. Tokyo has already compiled a package with government spending of about 1.8 trillion yen to deal with a sharp economic downturn, hit by slowing exports, its main engine for growth. Economists say a 2.0 trillion yen tax cut would probably boost the economy by only 0.1 to 0.2 percent, although they also say Tokyo cannot afford a large tax cut given that it has public debt that amounts to 150 percent of gross domestic product. Japan's economy posted its sharpest contraction in seven years in April-June quarter and the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in September is seen dealing a further blow. "Lehman's collapse caused a big fire and the sparks are now flying on to Japan, too. We must make sure the sparks will not cause a big fire here," said Yoshinori Ohno, a senior ruling party lawmaker in charge of its bank rescue package. The government's bank bailout plan was originally aimed at recapitalizing small regional banks with the aim of helping to smooth financing to small firms, which may face a credit crunch. But Economics Minister Kaoru Yosano said on Tuesday Japan's big banks should also be entitled to fund injections if needed. "When considering the need to facilitate lending to small firms, I can't see any reason why big banks should be discriminated against," Yosano told a news conference. Ruling party officials said the government would formally approve the bailout plan on Friday, so that capital injections are possible by the end of the year. "There could be a failure of small and mid-sized banks in the future. So it's good to have a safety net in place," said Takahide Kiuchi, chief economist at Nomura Securities. "But I don't think major banks will need capital injection. Effectively they have nothing to do with this," he added. Share prices of big Japanese banks have held up relatively well in the current credit turmoil. MUFG, Japan's biggest banking group, has risen nearly 20 percent in the past two weeks, making its year-to-date losses to 19 percent compared with 40 percent for the Nikkei average. BOJ NOMINEE The government's nominee for deputy governor at the Bank of Japan, Hirohide Yamaguchi, said at a confirmation hearing in parliament that Japanese money markets were stable compared with the United States and Europe though tension is gradually rising. Many foreign banks are having difficulty raising funds after the collapse of Lehman Brothers as Japanese banks have become cautious about lending to them, which has prompted the BOJ to provide extra liquidity in markets. Yamaguchi, a career central banker, mostly followed BOJ Governor Masaaki Shirakawa's line on the economy, saying uncertainty is large but the bank still has to watch both upside and downside risks. Parliament is expected to approve Yamaguchi on Friday. The opposition-controlled upper house has blocked five nominees for the BOJ policy board this year, leaving it with two vacancies including one for deputy governor since March. Yamaguchi said the BOJ would not sacrifice its policy judgment for the sake of international coordination. The Bank of Japan opted out of coordinated rate cuts by the world's major central banks earlier this month, saying the current policy target of 0.50 percent was appropriate. It has showed little indication of future easing, and money market derivatives are pricing in just over a 20 percent chance of a rate cut by the end of this year.
