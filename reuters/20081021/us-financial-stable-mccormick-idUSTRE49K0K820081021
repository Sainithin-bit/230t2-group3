 SHANGHAI  (Reuters) - Treasury Undersecretary David McCormick said on Tuesday that U.S. measures in response to the credit crisis were starting to have a positive effect on credit markets and he expected to see stability in all markets, including equities, in the next days or weeks. 

 He told a briefing for reporters it was appropriate for the yuan to continue appreciating and that he expected China to continue acting as a stable force in global markets. He said the yuan should appreciate both in nominal terms and in trade-weighted terms. (Reporting by Samuel Shen; Editing by Edmund Klamann and  Ken Wills )
