 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department said on Tuesday it has hired two prominent accounting firms to help it handle purchases and manage troubled assets that it intends to buy from banks. 

 Treasury said PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP will help establish audit controls and Ernst & Young will offer expert accounting advice for the portfolio of assets, including mortgage-backed securities and whole loans, that the government will acquire. The government is buying the illiquid and unwanted assets from banks to try to free them up to resume normal lending and in hope of eventually being able to resell the assets. The agreements that Treasury signed with the two accounting firms run until September 30, 2011. Treasury said PricewaterhouseCoopers will receive $191,469.27 and Ernst & Young $492,006.95 under the initial orders. Treasury put out two requests for quotes on the contracts from a pre-approved list of government contractors and got six responses to each request before deciding on the two firms.
