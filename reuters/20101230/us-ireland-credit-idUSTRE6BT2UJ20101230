 DUBLIN  (Reuters) - Irish domestic banks' reliance on funding from the European Central Bank rose significantly in November, completed figures for the month showed on Thursday. 

 The European Central Bank lent banks in Ireland, including foreign lenders, 138.2 billion in November, an increase on the 136 billion euros Ireland's central bank said lenders had received up to November 26. Domestic banks accounted for 97.3 billion euros of the total, a rise of 13.7 percent during a month that ended with Ireland securing an 85 billion euro IMF/EU bailout, the central bank said in a statement on Thursday. On top of the ECB funding, Ireland's central bank had lent the country's banks nearly 45 billion euros in exceptional liquidity assistance by November 26, a 10 billion euro increase on the previous month. No update was provided for this figure. Deposits from the Irish resident private sector were 6.7 percent lower on a year-to-year basis in November, separate figures showed. Allied Irish Banks ( ALBK.I ), which Ireland effectively nationalised last week, said last month that it had lost 13 billion euros in deposits since the end of June. Larger rival Bank of Ireland ( BKIR.I ) shed 10 billion euros of deposits in the third quarter while bancassurer Irish Life & Permanent ( IPM.I ) said it had suffered a 600 million outflow in the same period. Some 35 billion euros of the 85 billion euro bailout will be channelled to the country's banks. Around 10 billion euros will be used for immediate capital injections, and a further 25 billion be kept as a back-up in case further injections are needed. While the amount of outstanding loans to Ireland's private sector rose 4 percent year-on-year in November thanks mainly to an increase in securities other than shares, loans to households fell 4.8 percent in the period, unchanged from October. Lending for house purchases was 1.7 percent lower year-on-year, versus a 1.6 percent fall last month while lending for consumption and other purposes declined by 15.6 percent compared to a 14.9 percent dip in October.
