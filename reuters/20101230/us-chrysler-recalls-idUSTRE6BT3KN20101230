 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Chrysler Group LLC, the automaker managed by Italy's Fiat SpA, recalled more than 144,000 vehicles in three separate filings to federal regulators posted on Thursday. 

 In the largest of the three recalls, Chrysler said 65,180 Dodge Journey vehicles for the model year 2009 could have faulty wires within the front door wire harness. Those wires may break and interrupt the circuits for the side impact sensors and de-activate the side airbag, Chrysler said according to a notice to the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Cold weather also hurt the harnesses' ability to guard against the wires breaking, Chrysler said. Troy, Michigan-based auto supplier Delphi provided the wires. To date, there have been 23 customer complaints about the defect, with half received after the company opened an investigation in March. There have been no reports of crashes, fires or injuries linked to the defect, the automaker said. Chrysler also recalled 56,611 Ram 1500 trucks for the model year 2011 because the rear axle bearing could start to "growl" or "grind" and eventually seize, increasing the risk of a crash. Additionally, the automaker recalled 22,274 model year 2008 to 2011 Dodge Ram 4500 and 5500 vehicles because the left ball stud could weaken and hurt the driver's ability to steer the truck. In both cases, the company said it was not aware of any crashes or injuries related to the issue. (Reporting by  Deepa Seetharaman , editing by Dave Zimmerman)
