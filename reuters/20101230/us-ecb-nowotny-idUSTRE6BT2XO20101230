 VIENNA  (Reuters) - The European Union should move faster in setting up a permanent mechanism to manage sovereign debt problems given possible future challenges faced by some countries, ECB policymaker Ewald Nowotny said on Thursday. 

 Euro zone reforms, including making the stability and growth pact more effective, must be implemented quickly to "create a clear framework," said Nowotny, Governor of the Austrian Central Bank and a member of the ECB's Governing Council. "It cannot be ruled out that individual euro zone countries will face challenges," Nowotny said in a statement on the bank's website. Earlier this month European Union leaders agreed to set up a permanent mechanism from mid-2013 to resolve sovereign debt problems. "The reform of euro zone rules needs to be brought to a positive conclusion as quickly as possible, including making the growth and stability pact more effective, and the European Stability Mechanism should come into force before 2013 if possible," Nowotny said. The European Stability Mechanism is set to replace the temporary European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) created in May, and will be empowered to grant loans on strict conditions to member states in distress, with private sector bondholders sharing the cost of any writedowns. Earlier this year Greece and Ireland were forced to seek bailouts for their over-extended debt. Investors are concerned that the crisis could spread to other euro zone economies such as Portugal and possibly even Spain and Italy. The EU, together with the IMF, set up the 750 billion euro EFSF loan pool to help euro zone states unable to finance themselves in volatile markets. Nowotny said ensuring price stability would remain a core priority for the ECB in 2011 and that euro zone inflation is expected to stay within target at 1.8 percent in 2011 and 1.5 percent in 2012.
