 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - New York state Governor-elect Andrew Cuomo, who will be sworn in on Saturday, faces challenges including a growing budget deficit, a corrupt political culture and rivals for power in the state senate and assembly. 

 Among the tests the Democratic governor faces: STATE BUDGET The state faces a nearly $10 billion shortfall on a $136 billion budget and Cuomo has promised not to raise property taxes, which means the new governor may have to inflict painful cuts on politically popular programs such as Medicaid, which provides healthcare to the poor, and education. He may also have to take on the state employee unions. State liabilities to pension systems appear fully funded under government accounting but show a funding shortfall of $120 billion when measured using private sector accounting methods, according to a study by the Empire Center for New York State Policy. CORRUPTION Cuomo has called for ending the state capital Albany's notoriously corrupt political culture by implementing tough new ethics standards, requiring legislators to publicly declare where they get income, appointing independent investigators and reforming campaign finance laws. The challenge is getting initiatives passed by legislators who benefit from the existing system. At least three state senators, two assemblymen and the former state controller were convicted or sentenced on fraud-related charges in 2010. WALL STREET Cuomo's relationship to the financial world will be starkly different than it was during his past four years as New York attorney general, or "Sheriff of Wall Street." He will no longer lead a team of lawyers with broad authority to sue and enforce changes in securities dealings. Instead he must balance law enforcement with the need to stimulate the economy and make New York business-friendly. As New York's top legal officer, he was generally perceived as being less confrontational than former attorney general and governor Eliot Spitzer. "As did Eliot Spitzer, he will use the governorship as a bully pulpit to press an agenda that is important to him and that includes cleaning up the perceived mess on Wall Street," said Michael Shapiro, partner in Carter Ledyard & Millburn LLP law firm. GAS DRILLING When it comes to balancing politics with business, one test awaiting the governor is how to regulate the natural gas drilling method known as hydraulic fracturing, or "fracking." Energy companies want to exploit the Marcellus Shale in New York much as they have across the state border in Pennsylvania, home to a drilling boom that has raised environmental concerns about leaks and spills that have contaminated ground water. Cuomo has offered few policy specifics while awaiting assessments being prepared by the state Department of Environmental Conservation and the U.S. federal Environmental Protection Agency.

For years the most powerful politician in Albany has not been the governor, it has been Sheldon Silver, the speaker of the state assembly. A liberal Democrat from downtown Manhattan, Silver has clashed with Republican and Democratic governors -- and rarely lost. Cuomo is more conservative and potential clashes with Silver await on tax-and-spending issues. The third partner is Senate Majority Leader Dean Skelos, a Republican and virtual co-equal who will need to be wooed to get laws passed in the upper chamber.
