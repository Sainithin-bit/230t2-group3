 WASHINGTON/NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Treasury Department is converting $5.5 billion of its preferred shares in Ally Financial, the lender once known as GMAC, into common stock, laying the groundwork for exiting the investment. 

 Ally, which hopes to go public next year and has been working to clean up its balance sheet, was buffeted by losses on mortgages and other loans amid the financial crisis and received more than $17 billion in several rounds of government cash injections. The move to convert some of the shares is "designed to accelerate Treasury's ability to exit its investment in the company," the department said in a statement on Thursday. It will take the government's common stock ownership of the firm to 74 percent, up from 56 percent. For Ally, the conversion is important because it boosts the lender's tier one capital -- an important measure of capital strength -- and brings it in line with its peers, a senior Treasury official said. That should help the company attract outside investment, he added. Ally's tangible common equity will increase to $13.8 billion after the conversion. The company had $8.25 billion in tangible common equity at the end of the third quarter. U.S. taxpayers became majority owners of Ally as part of the government's bailout of the auto sector in late 2008. Treasury's investment in Ally is $17.2 billion. General Motors owned Ally, then known as GMAC, but sold a controlling stake to private equity investors in 2006. Ally plans to go public next year.
