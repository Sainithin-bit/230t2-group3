 BEIJING  (Reuters) - China's Ministry of Commerce protested against a European Union decision to launch an anti-subsidy investigation into Chinese-made coated paper, which it said was the first such investigation by the EU. 

 The anti-subsidy probe, announced in the EU's Official Journal Saturday, followed an anti-dumping investigation launched two months ago on coated paper, used in books and magazines. It cited preferential loans by Chinese state-owned banks and government-backed loans and interest subsidies for forestry programs. In a statement posted over the weekend on the ministry's website, www.mofcom.gov.cn, spokesman Yao Jian said the investigation amounted to discrimination against Chinese products and went against the rules of the World Trade Organization. "The European Union's investigation sends a wrong message of protectionism to the world," Yao said. A European association of fine paper manufacturers, representing over 25 percent of EU fine paper output, requested the investigation on March 4, the Official Journal said. The United States on March 3 decided to impose preliminary countervailing duties ranging from 3.92 to 12.83 percent on coated paper from China and Indonesia. After the American ruling, Asia Pulp & Paper (APP), one of the largest paper producers in Asia and a major exporter of coated paper from both countries, said it would continue to fight the duties. The U.S. manufacturers have argued to the Commerce Department that the level of the Chinese yuan, which they say is undervalued against the dollar, represents a further subsidy. Yao called on the EU to solve trade frictions with China based on negotiations and cooperations, because the two sides are important trade partners.
