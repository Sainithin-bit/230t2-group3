 LONDON  (Reuters) - Electrical goods retailer Best Buy ( BBY.N ) plans to open up to 1,000 new mobile phone shops, the Financial Times reported in its Monday edition. 

 Brian Dunn, chief executive of the world's biggest electricals retailer, told the FT he intends to open "a number somewhere between here and 1,000" of Best Buy Mobile stores across U.S. shopping complexes. Best Buy has said it planned to open 50 to 55 large-format stores and 75 to 100 small-format stores mainly mobile phone shops, in the United States this year. It also plans to open 10 to 15 stores in China. Last month Best Buy forecast stronger-than-expected earnings in the current year citing growing demand for electronics in an improving economy.
