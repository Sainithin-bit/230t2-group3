 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - United Technology Corp's ( UTX.N ) Sikorsky Aircraft unit is teaming up with Lockheed Martin ( LMT.N ) to bid on a new contract for a fleet of Marine One helicopters, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday, citing two people familiar with the details. 

 According the report, the two companies are expected to announce the plan on Monday. Under the plan, Sikorsky would build the helicopters and Lockheed would build the specialized systems inside the helicopters, the Journal said. It could be at least a year until a winning bidder is named by the Pentagon, the Journal said. Other bidders are not yet known. Sikorsky and Lockheed Martin were not immediately available for comment. (Reporting by  Michael Erman )
