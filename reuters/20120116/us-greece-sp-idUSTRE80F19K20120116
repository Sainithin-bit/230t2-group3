 LONDON  (Reuters) - Greece will default shortly on its debt obligations, a senior Standard & Poor's official told Bloomberg Television on Monday. 
 "Greece will default very shortly. Whether there will be a solution at the end of the current rocky negotiations I cannot say," said Moritz Kraemer, the head of the agency's European sovereign ratings unit. "There is a lot of brinksmanship on and a disorderly default will have ramifications on other countries but I believe policymakers will want to avoid that ... The game is still on."
