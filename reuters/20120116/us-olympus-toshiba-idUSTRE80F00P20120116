 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Toshiba Corp ( 6502.T ) on Monday denied a newspaper report it was set to propose an equity tie-up with scandal-hit Olympus Corp ( 7733.T ). 
 "There is no truth to this," a Toshiba spokesman told Reuters, after the Nikkan Kogyo said the company was expected to submit a business plan to Olympus's financial advisers. (Reporting by  Isabel Reynolds ; Editing by  Chris Gallagher )
