 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Standard & Poor's cut the credit rating on Europe's bailout fund on Monday, just days after stripping France and Austria of their triple A credit status. 
 The credit rater lowered the European Financial Stability Facility to AA+ from AAA, which could increase its borrowing costs. (Reporting By  Rachelle Younglai ; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)
