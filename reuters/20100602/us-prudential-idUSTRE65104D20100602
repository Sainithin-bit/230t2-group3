 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - UK insurer Prudential ( PRU.L ) ( 2378.HK ) on Thursday confirmed its agreement to buy American International Group's ( AIG.N ) Asia life unit had been terminated and it would pay AIG a termination fee of 152.6 million pounds. 

 Prudential ( PRTL.SI ) said in a filing to Hong Kong stock exchange that it would not proceed with the rights issue or other financing related to the deal, while an annual general meeting would go ahead as planned June 7. The UK insurer abandoned its plan to buy AIG's Asian life unit for $35.5 billion, leaving management under fire and the company facing a $659 million bill for failure.
