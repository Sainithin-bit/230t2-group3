 BEIJING  (Reuters) - Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao has said his government is preparing steps to tame price rises, adding his voice to official efforts to reassure consumers irked by a rapid rise in the price of food. 

 Wen made the comments during a recent visit to far southern China, the official Xinhua news agency reported late on Tuesday. Consumer prices in the fast-growing economy have been rising at their fastest pace in more than two years, and Wen, the country's head of government, said his cabinet was planning action to slow inflationary pressures. "Market supply and demand and prices are a direct interest of the public, and we have to pay a lot of attention to them," he said while visiting a supermarket in Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong province, according to Xinhua. "The State Council is drafting measures to curb excessively fast price rises," he said. The State Council is China's name for its central cabinet. The report did not give any details of what those measures may be. Wen's remarks were widely publicized in Chinese-state run media on Wednesday, in what appeared to be part of a concerted effort to reassure consumers that officials are heeding complaints about the price of vegetables, meat and grains. On Tuesday, the central bank governor, Zhou Xiaochuan, said China will unveil food price controls and crack down on speculation in agricultural commodities to contain inflationary pressure. Consumer price inflation sped to a 25-month high in October, with prices rising 4.4 percent from a year earlier. Food, which makes up about a third of China's consumer price index, led the way, climbing 10.1 percent. Non-food items rose just 1.6 percent. But unlike past bouts of food inflation in China, there have been no major droughts or diseases to stoke prices this year. Instead, fast money growth appears to be the primary culprit.
