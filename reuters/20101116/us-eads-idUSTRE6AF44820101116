 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - A group of institutional investors, who lost heavily in June 2006 when EADS's share price collapsed, will file a civil suit over the way it announced production delays on the A380 project. 

 Pieter Koetsier, lawyer with Kennedy van der Laan, said on Tuesday the suit would be filed this week or next at the Amsterdam civil court on behalf of a special foundation representing some 100 institutional investors. Earlier this month the Amsterdam commercial court threw out a request by some investors for a probe into the management of EADS and the way it had communicated the production problems -- in particular about a complex wiring issue that caused big delivery delays and prompted compensation claims from clients. The A380 superjumbo, Airbus' biggest passenger plane, is currently beset by a problem with Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines that forced Australia's Qantas to ground its fleet temporarily. "We are filing a civil suit, that is a different jurisdiction (than the commercial court). First we want to establish that EADS was responsible for the losses caused and if that is the case we will file for damages," Koetsier said. The special foundation is headed by Alexander Reus, a partner at U.S. class-action specialists Diaz, Reus of Miami. OPEN TO OUT-OF-COURT SETTLEMENT Philipp Lehmann, a spokesman for EADS, said the claims were likely to be dismissed. "The announcement of law suits in the Netherlands is not new to us: they refer to delays which were made public in 2006; respective claims have always been totally unfounded, from our point of view," he said in an emailed statement to Reuters. "Only recently on 3 November 2010, the potential plaintiffs learned that the Amsterdam Court of Appeal ... had dismissed their application to order an investigation regarding alleged "mismanagement" by EADS in connection with the A380 delivery delays in the year of 2006," he said. "If a Dutch civil court would have to deal with the same issue, we anticipate that it would come to the same conclusion." Reus, a German-trained lawyer, said the foundation ( here ) represented 60 million shares which was over 20 percent of the free outstanding shares. EADS is 55-percent controlled by French, German and Spanish entities. He declined to say who was behind the foundation other than saying there were institutional investors from many countries including those that were behind the case at the commercial court -- Irish Life Investment Managers and DekaBank Investment. Reus said the foundation was not legally able to seek damages itself but if the court was to find EADS liable, the investors could seek damages individually. "We are not trying to get the U.S. class-action system to Europe but we are seeking ways to permit investors to seek compensation," Reus said, adding that incurred losses were in the region of 800 million to 1 billion euros ($1.12-$1.40 billion). Reus said the foundation was open to an out-of-court settlement. EADS has its statutory headquarters in Amsterdam. Clifford Chance, lawyers for EADS, declined to comment. Koetsier and Reus said the civil case could take several months. (Reporting by  Marcel Michelson ; Editing by Jon Loades-Carter)
