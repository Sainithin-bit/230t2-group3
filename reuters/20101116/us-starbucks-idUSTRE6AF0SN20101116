 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp ( SBUX.O ) said on Monday it is not planning to enter the small but growing market for single-cup coffee brewers at this time. 

 "We have no plans to launch our own one-cup brewer at this time," said Starbucks spokesman Alan Hilowitz in an email. The comment comes three days after news outlets including The Wall Street Journal and Reuters reported that Starbucks was planning to enter the market with its own brewer.
