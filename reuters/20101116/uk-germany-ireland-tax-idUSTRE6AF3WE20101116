 KARLSRUHE, Germany  (Reuters) - Germany stepped up pressure on Ireland to raise its corporate tax rate on Tuesday with a senior finance expert in Chancellor Angela Merkel's party saying the Irish government could do so without hurting growth. 

 Dublin's 12.5 percent corporate tax rate, one of the lowest in the 27-nation European Union, has been a key part of its economic strategy and crucial to tempting big employers like Google Inc and Pfizer to Ireland. Irish borrowing costs have surged in recent weeks and the country is now under pressure to ask the EU for financial assistance to help it cope with its fragile banks. It is unclear what kind of reforms the EU could demand in exchange for aid. But Michael Meister, a deputy leader in parliament and finance expert for Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU), said the country needed to consider raising the levy. "The Irish rates are below the European Union average," Meister told Reuters on the sidelines of the CDU annual party congress in the southwestern city of Karlsruhe. "I therefore see here at least a possibility, given the high (Irish) budget deficit, to improve revenues without causing a negative impact on growth," he added. The low rate is a source of irritation in some European capitals, including Berlin, which view it as unfair competition and there has been a real fear in Dublin that Europe would demand an increase. Meister's comments come one day after Elmar Brok, a senior CDU lawmaker who has sat in the European Parliament since 1980, said Ireland may have no choice but to raise the rate. "Ireland has two options to consolidate its budget -- cut expenses even further or increase taxes like the corporate tax rate," Brok said at the congress in Karlsruhe. Ireland is relying on exports to help the economy grow by a forecast 1.75 percent next year and has repeatedly said it will not increase the rate it taxes the output of multi-nationals. A 2008 report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said that on average studies find that a one percentage point increase in the effective corporate tax rate leads to a 3.7 percent decline in foreign direct investment.
