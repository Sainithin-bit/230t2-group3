 LONDON  (Reuters) - There is no reason why Ireland should trigger an international bailout and European finance ministers should not panic, Ireland's European affairs minister Dick Roche said on Tuesday. 

 "I would hope after the Ecofin meeting this afternoon and tomorrow there would be more logic introduced into this," Roche told BBC radio. "There is no reason why we should trigger an IMF or an EU-type bailout. "There is a problem with liquidity in banks, there is no doubt about that. But I don't think that the appropriate response to that would be for the European finance ministers to panic." (Reporting by  Tim Castle )
