 DUBLIN  (Reuters) - Ireland's Prime Minister said on Tuesday that euro zone finance ministers were seeking to find ways to deal with the high cost of funding in the currency bloc during meetings in Brussels. 

 Cowen also reiterated that Ireland has not applied for a bailout from the EU. "The cost of money is simply too high," Brian Cowen said in parliament. "We have to find further initiatives within the euro area to deal with that matter, and that is precisely the discussions that are ongoing and which (Irish Finance Minister) Brian Lenihan is attending today."
