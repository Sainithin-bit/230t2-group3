 LISBON  (Reuters) - Portugal has not pressured Ireland to seek emergency financial aid from the European Union, Finance Minister Fernando Teixeira dos Santos was quoted as saying on Tuesday. 

 "Portugal has exerted no pressure, this is not true," he told Jornal de Negocios business newspaper, adding that Portugal would face greater pressure in the markets if Ireland was to request a bailout. Finding a way out of Ireland's debt crisis is set to dominate discussions when Teixeira dos Santos and other euro zone finance ministers gather later on Tuesday for a meeting in Brussels. Risk premiums on Portuguese bonds last week rose to their highest levels since euro adoption on concerns over the knock-on impact of Ireland's debt troubles on the Iberian country, which is also burdened with a high budget deficit and debt. Teixeira dos Santos was quoted on Monday as saying Ireland should consider the entire euro zone's needs. "I want to believe they will decide to do what is most appropriate together for Ireland and the euro. I want to believe they have the vision to take the right decision," the Wall Street Journal quoted him as saying. Ireland signaled on Monday its banks, not the state, might need help with funding and some of its euro zone partners urged a swift decision on any EU rescue, saying the uncertainty was rattling markets and hurting them. "The Irish authorities have to decide and they have already decided that they are not going to seek European aid. I don't have to give advice, especially to those who know what they want," Teixeira dos Santos told Jornal de Negocios. Teixeira dos Santos told Reuters on Monday Lisbon had no plans to request emergency funding after the Financial Times quoted him as saying there was a high risk Lisbon would have to seek aid. "Such a request is not imminent, there are no contacts, be it formal or informal," he told Reuters, adding that Portugal's situation was very different from Ireland. "The rest are rumors and speculation." He also told the Jornal de Negocios that "the statements I made to Financial Times do not at all acknowledge resorting to the European aid fund."
