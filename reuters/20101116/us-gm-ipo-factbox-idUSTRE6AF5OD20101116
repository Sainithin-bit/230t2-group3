 (Reuters) - General Motors Co GM.UL raised the price range for its initial public offering of common stock and added $1 billion to a preferred stock offering, pushing the overall deal to potentially $18.45 billion. 

 GM raised the common stock price range to $32 to $33 per share, from the previous range of $26 to $29 per share. It increased the preferred stock offering and left the total shares of common stock unchanged. GM will receive no proceeds from the common stock offering. It plans to use the proceeds from the preferred offering to buy Series A preferred shares held by the U.S. Treasury and make contributions to its U.S. hourly and salaried pension plans. A summary of the potential value of the offering follows based on the common stock range, preferred offering and overallotments to underwriters. * Total IPO and preferred offerings before overallotments: $15.68 billion to $16.05 billion. The midpoint would be $15.86 billion. * Total IPO and preferred offerings including all overallotments: $18.03 billion to $18.45 billion. The midpoint would be $18.24 billion. * Treasury total take from IPO and preferred offering: Up to $10 billion from common stock sales including overallotments and $2.1 billion from selling its Series A preferred shares to GM when the IPO is completed. * Common share price range: $32 to $33 per share * Common shares offered: unchanged at 365 million * Optional underwriter overallotment: 54.75 million shares * Total common shares with overallotments: 419.75 million * IPO proceeds: Ranging from $11.68 billion to nearly $12.05 billion, with a midpoint of $11.86 billion. * IPO proceeds with overallotments exercised: Ranging from $13.43 billion to $13.85 billion with a midpoint of $13.64 billion. * Series B preferred shares price: $50 per share * Preferred shares offered: raised to 80 million * Optional underwriter overallotment: 12 million shares * Total preferred shares with overallotments: 92 million * Preferred shares proceeds: $4 billion * Preferred proceeds with overallotment: $4.6 billion Treasury common shares stake: 60.8 percent. Expected to be reduced to 43.3 percent after IPO, or 40.6 percent if all the overallotments are exercised. Treasury plans to sell: 263.5 million common shares Treasury overallotment to underwriters: 39.5 million shares * Treasury sales: Treasury total proceeds before expenses and overallotments could range from $8.43 billion to $8.7 billion with a midpoint of $8.56 billion.
