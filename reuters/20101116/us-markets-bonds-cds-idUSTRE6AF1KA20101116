 LONDON  (Reuters) - The cost of insuring Irish debt against default rose on Tuesday, as peripheral euro zone tensions continued to put pressure on the currency bloc's higher-yielding issuers ahead of key Eurogroup talks. 

 Ireland has faced calls to turn to the European Union for bailout funds to tackle its financial problems, but has so far been reluctant to ask for aid. Five-year credit default swaps (CDS) on Irish government debt rose to 507 bps, according to data monitor Markit. This means it costs 507,000 euros to protect 10 million euros of exposure to Irish bonds. "There's very little volume and the market's just drifting, responding to headlines, ahead of any clarity from the politicians after the Eurogroup meeting today," a trader said. Two-year Irish CDS was at 520 bps, meaning the curve was inverted, though liquidity was very thin and bid-offer spreads wide, Markit analyst Gavan Nolan said. (Reporting by London markets team)
