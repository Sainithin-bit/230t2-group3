 DUBLIN  (Reuters) - An Irish minister reiterated a denial on Monday that Ireland was in direct discussions about a bailout package from the European Union, but he said "continuous talks" were taking place. EU sources told Reuters that talks on a possible bailout were under way and that Ireland was unlikely to be able to manage its debt without assistance. On Sunday a senior minister did not rule out the need for possible help. 

 "The argument that Ireland is about to go banging on the door of the IMF or needs to (take an) ... EU bailout is simply wrong but if it gets more legs, it could be very, very dangerous," Junior Minister for European Affairs Dick Roche told Newstalk radio. "There is continuous talk going on backwards and forwards about the level of our debt but the suggestion that that constitutes going to the IMF or the bailout is just irresponsible."
