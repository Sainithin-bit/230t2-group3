 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. home-builder sentiment in November rose slightly for the second straight month though it remains at historically low levels, according to a survey released on Tuesday. 

 The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index rose less than expected to 16 from last month's downwardly revised 15. October was first reported as 16. Economists polled by Reuters expected a rise to 17. A reading above 50 indicates that more builders view sales conditions as good than poor. The index has not been above 50 since April 2006.
