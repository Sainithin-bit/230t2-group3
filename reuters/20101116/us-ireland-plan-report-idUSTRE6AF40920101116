 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - European officials are weighing a rescue package of 80 billion to 100 billion euros for Ireland and a separate, smaller bailout for its hard-pressed banking sector, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday. 

 The International Monetary Fund would have a role in the rescue, the newspaper said, citing unnamed sources. Initial attempts to contact the IMF for comment were unsuccessful. (Reporting by  Glenn Somerville , Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
