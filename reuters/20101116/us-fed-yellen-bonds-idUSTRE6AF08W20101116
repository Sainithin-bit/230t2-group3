 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve is not trying to push down the value of the U.S. dollar or boost inflation above 2 percent, the central bank's vice chairwoman said, defending its program of massive new bond purchases. 

 In an interview published on Monday in the Wall Street Journal, Janet Yellen defended the Fed's decision this month to purchase $600 billion more of U.S. Treasury bonds in a bid to strengthen economic growth. "The purpose of it is not to push down the dollar. This should not be regarded as some sort of chapter in a currency war," she told the newspaper. The Fed's action drew international criticism that the central bank was trying to undermine the dollar to the detriment of other nations. Domestically, some prominent Republicans have also criticized the move. Yellen, who said she was not happy to see the Fed "caught up in a political debate," said the central bank decided to take the controversial measures because of extremely high unemployment, which could last a long time. Inflation, she said, would stay at "very low levels" for some time. "I don't think this is a panacea. But the question is: Do we have an effective policy that we can adopt?" she said. "If we do, and it actually produces expected benefits and addresses risks that we face, then there is a clear case for doing it, even if it is not going to be a panacea." She said it was not fair to paint the Fed's bond purchase program as a cause of capital flow problems in other countries. DIFFICULT TERRAIN Yellen said the U.S. economy would continue to grow but it would take a long time to get unemployment down from 9.6 percent to 8 percent. "I'm having a hard time seeing where really robust growth can come from. And I see inflation lingering around current levels for a long time," she said. "If you ask me to name an unemployment rate we'd see at the end of 2012, it would probably be around 8 percent. I expect a pickup in growth next year. I don't expect a double-dip recession." She forecast the economy would be back at 2 percent inflation with unemployment beneath 7 percent in "something like 2013." But she cautioned that growth could fall short of forecasts, leading to higher joblessness. "The economy also has real downside risk. It's conceivable that growth could fall short of what we're expecting and unemployment could start heading up further," she said. "And if we really get a weak scenario with unwinding confidence or, who knows, larger losses for financial institutions, we could find ourselves with a downward dynamic occurring that really takes us into very difficult terrain."
