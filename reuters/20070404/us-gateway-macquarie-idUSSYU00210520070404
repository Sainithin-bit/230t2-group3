 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Australia's Publishing & Broadcasting Ltd. PBL.AX has teamed up with Macquarie Bank Ltd. MBL.AX to buy nine Canadian casinos for C$1.37 billion ($1.18 billion), extending its gaming empire to North America. 

 PBL, controlled by Australia's richest man James Packer, and investment bank Macquarie said on Wednesday they had agreed to buy Canada's Gateway Casinos Income Fund GCI_u.TO for C$886 million. The fund is one of the largest casino operators in Western Canada. The newly-established Australian joint venture would also buy Gateway Casino assets and the Canadian firm's half share in a private casino operator, bringing the total value of the deal to C$1.37 billion. PBL has A$3 billion ($2.4 billion) to spend after selling half its media assets into a joint venture with CVC Asia Pacific CVC.UL last year and has said it would use the money to make international gaming acquisitions. "It's very consistent with PBL's strategy of basically reducing their exposure to things they're already in and gaining more exposure to gaming and casinos," said investment analyst Peter Chilton from Constellation Capital Management. "We will probably see PBL becoming increasingly aggressive in acquisitions in casinos globally." Rowen Craigie, CEO of PBL Gaming, said in a statement: "We see Gateway as a great opportunity in the North American gaming sector." It was Macquarie's second gaming investment following a successful joint bid for British amusement arcade firm Talarius Plc TLS.L with Australian gaming firm Tattersall's ( TTS.AX ) in November. The PBL-Macquarie JV, called New World Gaming, offered C$25.26 per cash for each unit in the trust. The offer was a 25.7 percent premium to the closing price of the fund's units in Toronto on April 2. PBL and Macquarie said they would both contribute C$195 million in equity to the joint venture, along with external debt of C$975 million. PBL also owns a joint venture with Hong Kong firm Melco International Development Ltd. ( 0200.HK ), which is planning to build three casinos in Macau. Macquarie shares were trading 2.1 percent higher at A$84.25 at 0541 GMT, while PBL added 1.8 percent to A$20.21 in a broader market .AXJO that was 1.3 percent higher.
