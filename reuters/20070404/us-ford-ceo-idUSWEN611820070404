 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) Chief Executive Alan Mulally said on Wednesday that the restructuring of the automaker's North American operations is "generally going pretty well at this point." 

 Mulally, in a speech at the New York Auto Show, said the company is stabilizing its market share right now. Ford is in the midst of a massive turnaround that calls for the closing of 14 facilities. Mulally said the restructuring at the company, which posted a $12,7 billion loss last year, has caused "tremendous upheaval."
