 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - Japanese car and engine maker Honda ( 7267.T ) said on Wednesday it had selected software and services from IBM ( IBM.N ) and Dassault ( DAST.PA ) to build its Formula One racing cars more quickly and efficiently. 

 Previously run as a separate enterprise from the UK, the Honda Racing F1 Team will use the new computer system to work closely with engineers at parent company Honda Motor Co. Ltd. in Japan. "Formula One vehicles are completely wired. Performance data from the vehicle is fed directly to the driver and the pits. That information needs to be available instantly to everyone to keep the car performing at the highest level. The engineers could be in Japan or in the UK," said Mark Wilterding, a global partner at IBM's product lifecycle management unit. "Suppose the car is on the race track and has trouble negotiating hairpins. The suspension systems may not be built to the tolerance they need to be. That information can be used in a pits stop at the race. Or engineers can change the car for the next race, or come up with a new design," Wilterding said. "Formula One is the pinnacle of the motorsports industry, where the ability to compress the development cycle of the car is critical," David France, information technology director at the Honda Racing F1 Team said in a statement.
