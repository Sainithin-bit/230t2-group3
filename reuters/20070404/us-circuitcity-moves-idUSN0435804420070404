 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Circuit City Stores CC.N, which is closing stores and letting go of higher-paid store staff, on Wednesday said it would accelerate cost-cuts by trimming layers of management, controlling discretionary spending, improving direct sourcing and taking other moves. 

 "We must move with urgency to develop a world-class retail platform" and expand revenue, Circuit City Chief Executive Philip Schoonover said in detailing the changes during an earnings conference call. The CEO also said the consumer electronics retailer has identified "several" candidates for the post of chief financial officer and expects to begin interviews shortly.
