 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Micron Technology Inc. MU.N posted a quarterly loss on Wednesday as falling prices for memory chips and weak demand for image sensors dealt a blow to the top U.S. memory chip maker. 

 Micron said the net loss for its fiscal second quarter was $52 million, or 7 cents per share, compared with a profit of $193.2 million, or 27 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue was $1.43 billion, up 16.5 percent from a year earlier. Wall Street analysts had expected Micron to lose 1 cent per share on sales of $1.47 billion. Micron said it saw "significant declines" in prices for much of its product line, including a 30-percent drop in prices for NAND flash, the kind of memory chip commonly used in consumer electronics. Image sensors, which have been a growth area for Micron as it diversifies away from the volatile memory market, saw sales decline sequentially due to weak demand for mobile handsets and a market shift toward lower-priced phones, the company said. Shares in the Boise, Idaho-based company rose 30 cents, or 2.5 percent, in extended trading after the results were announced. The stock fell 1.3 percent to close at $12.07 in regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
