 MILAN  (Reuters) - A battle for power in Telecom Italia ( TLIT.MI ) festered on Wednesday after Olimpia, which controls the telecoms firm, moved to sack its chairman over strategy and rivals took emergency steps to stop the plan. 

 Olimpia, a holding company which is controlled by Pirelli ( PECI.MI ), proposed board members for Italy's largest telecoms company -- where it has an 18 percent stake -- but left out Chairman Guido Rossi. Telecom Italia investors Generali ( GASI.MI ) and Mediobanca ( MDBI.MI ) said after a meeting attended by Rossi and other company executives they did not agree with Olimpia's list and called for an immediate meeting of key investors in Pirelli. That would bring under scrutiny Pirelli Chairman Marco Tronchetti Provera, who gave way to Rossi as chairman of Telecom Italia in September in an argument with the government over strategy. Pirelli, which holds 80 percent of Olimpia, is in talks to sell a majority of it to U.S. phone giant AT&T ( T.N ) and America Movil ( AMXL.MX ) ( AMX.N ), the mobile phone group of Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, for about 4.5 billion euros. But Mediobanca and Generali have a right of first refusal on the Olimpia stake, and together with financial investors Hopa and Romain Zaleski hold at least 9.4 percent of Telecom Italia. About 15.9 percent of Telecom Italia's capital has changed hands in the last three days. These investors had been working to put together a rival list of board members for Telecom Italia, which would have included Rossi, two sources close to the situation had said. Mediobanca is one of several Italian financial institutions that have been working to find a deal for Pirelli's stake in Olimpia as the government has pushed for domestic intervention. Talks have stumbled on price, with the transatlantic offer at a hefty premium to Telecom Italia's market value of around 2.4 euros. In the last few months, Pirelli has held talks over its Olimpia stake -- where the Benetton family holds the remaining 20 percent -- with several foreign players and Italian banks. IRREPARABLE BREAK Rossi opposed a broad alliance with Spain's Telefonica ( TEF.MC ) last month that was part of an agreement Tronchetti was negotiating that had included Telefonica buying a stake in Olimpia. "Evidently, there was an irreparable break between Rossi and Tronchetti Provera," said Alessandro Frigerio, a fund manager at RMJ in Milan. "(Telecom Italia board member Pasquale) Pistorio is a likely candidate to replace Rossi." Born in 1936, Pistorio headed chip maker STMicroelectronics ( STM.PA ) for 18 years until 2005. He was one of three board members close to Pirelli who abstained from voting on Rossi's industrial plan during a March 8 board meeting in which tensions over the company's future strategy became evident. Board member nominations have to be approved by Telecom Italia's shareholders at a meeting on April 16. As Telecom Italia's top shareholder, Olimpia may name four-fifths of the 19 member board. Without the backing of shareholders with a bigger holding than Olimpia, Rossi will effectively be fired. (additional reporting by Paola Arosio)
