 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - The following is a summary of recent comments by Fed policy-makers: 

 * Denotes 2007 voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets U.S. monetary policy. DALLAS FED PRESIDENT RICHARD FISHER, APRIL 4: "Inflation is running at too high a rate now," Fisher said after a speech to the Austin Mortgage Bankers Association. "I would like to see inflation lower than it currently is." "Thus far, the damage from the subprime market has been largely contained. Nevertheless, because 40 percent of homebuyers last year were non-prime ... borrowers, housing markets may feel some short-term pains, making it less clear whether housing construction has bottomed." * ST. LOUIS FED PRESIDENT WILLIAM POOLE, APRIL 3: "Inflation is a major concern and if inflation were to head up in a convincing way from the current level, I could be in favor of a rate increase at some point," Poole said after a speech to the New York chapter of the National Association for Business Economics. "My concern is capital spending may be an indication of some reduced optimism about demand going forward." RICHMOND FEDERAL RESERVE PRESIDENT JEFFREY LACKER, MARCH 29: "In the last three to six months the downside risks have definitely crept up. At the same time ... the longer we go on without a noteworthy decline in inflation, the more the risk we run of entrenching expectations where they are now," Lacker told reporters after a speech in Richmond. "Central banks should not take inflation expectations for granted by acting in ways that are inconsistent with expectations but assuming expectations will not change," Lacker told the Virginia Association of Economists. "This apparent stability, relative to the wide swings (inflation expectations) displayed in prior decades, should not be cause for complacency, particularly with inflation running uncomfortably high," he said. MINNEAPOLIS FEDERAL RESERVE PRESIDENT GARY STERN, MARCH 29: "To be sure, the housing sector has been a drag on activity and is of concern but I suspect that the bulk, although not all, of the adjustment in residential construction is behind us," he said in Dayton, Ohio. "The subprime market is just a fraction of the overall market. It is not big enough to become a major impact on a $13 trillion economy." "I would not expect inflation to accelerate even if compensation does, as long as the Federal Reserve remains committed to a stable, low inflation policy," Stern said. * FED CHAIRMAN BEN BERNANKE, MARCH 28: "Our policy is still oriented toward control of inflation, which we consider to be at this time to be the greater risk," he told the congressional Joint Economic Committee. "I would say it would be more accurate to say that we are looking for a bit more flexibility given the uncertainties that we are facing and the risks that are occurring on both sides of our outlook." "To the downside, the correction in the housing market could turn out to be more severe than we currently expect, perhaps exacerbated by problems in the subprime sector. Moreover, we could yet see greater spillover from the weakness in housing to employment and consumer spending than has occurred thus far "The possibility that the recent weakness in business investment will persist is an additional downside risk. To the upside, consumer spending -- which has proved quite resilient despite the housing downturn and increases in energy prices -- might continue to grow at a brisk pace, stimulating a more rapid economic expansion than we currently anticipate." * CHICAGO FED PRESIDENT MICHAEL MOSKOW, MARCH 26: "We all think (core inflation above 2 percent for three years) is too high. It gets built into expectations and then it's very hard to control, very hard to reduce. So inflation is our predominant concern," he told students at Tsinghua University in Beijing. "We believe that there's enough slack already built into the economy in 2007 to enable us to have lower inflation in 2008 and at the end of 2007." * FED GOVERNOR FREDERIC MISHKIN, MARCH 23: "I am less optimistic about the prospects for core PCE inflation to move much below 2 percent in the absence of a determined effort by monetary policy," he said at a conference at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. "A substantial further decline in inflation would require a shift in expectations, and such a shift could be difficult and time consuming to bring about." PHILADELPHIA FED PRESIDENT CHARLES PLOSSER, MARCH 23: "The last couple of months' (inflation) numbers are not encouraging. We had seen some abatement of inflation but don't see that recently," he said at a bankers' conference in Palm Beach, Florida. FEDERAL OPEN MARKET COMMITTEE, MARCH 21: "Recent indicators have been mixed and the adjustment in the housing sector is ongoing. Nevertheless, the economy seems likely to continue to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters. "Recent readings on core inflation have been somewhat elevated. Although inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time, the high level of resource utilization has the potential to sustain those pressures. "In these circumstances, the Committee's predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected. Future policy adjustments will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information."
