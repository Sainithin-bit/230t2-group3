 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Australia's Publishing & Broadcasting Ltd. PBL.AX has teamed up with Macquarie Bank Ltd. MBL.AX to buy nine Canadian casinos for C$1.37 billion ($1.18 billion), extending its gaming empire to North America. 

 PBL, controlled by James Packer, Australia's richest man, and investment bank Macquarie said on Wednesday they had agreed to buy Canada's Gateway Casinos Income Fund GCI_u.TO for C$886 million. The fund is one of the largest casino operators in Western Canada. The newly established Australian joint venture would also buy Gateway Casino assets and the firm's half share in a private casino operator, bringing the total value of the deal to C$1.37 billion. The news sent Gateway units up 25.6 percent, or C$5.12, to C$25.15 on the Toronto Stock Exchange, before backing off a bit to C$25.04 on a volume of 6.6 million shares by mid-afternoon. Gateway Chief Executive Dave Gadhia urged unitholders to support the proposed deal, saying it offered investors an opportunity to "capitalize on the strong, current interest" in the gaming sector. "Put simply, we believe this offer represents exceptional value for investors," Gadhia told analysts in a conference call. "It provides an immediate and substantial premium." PBL has A$3 billion ($2.4 billion) to spend after selling half its media assets into a joint venture with CVC Asia Pacific CVC.UL last year and has said it would use the money to make international gaming acquisitions. "It's very consistent with PBL's strategy of basically reducing their exposure to things they're already in and gaining more exposure to gaming and casinos," said investment analyst Peter Chilton from Constellation Capital Management. "We will probably see PBL becoming increasingly aggressive in acquisitions in casinos globally." Rowen Craigie, CEO of PBL Gaming, said in a statement: "We see Gateway as a great opportunity in the North American gaming sector." It was Macquarie's second gaming investment following a successful joint bid for British amusement arcade firm Talarius Plc TLS.L with Australian gaming firm Tattersall's ( TTS.AX ) in November. The PBL-Macquarie JV, called New World Gaming, offered C$25.26 in cash for each Gateway unit. The offer was a 25.7 percent premium to the closing price in Toronto on April 2. The offer is subject to certain conditions, including acceptance by holders of at least two-thirds of outstanding units of the fund. The deal is also subject to regulatory approvals in British Columbia and Alberta, Gateway said. The proposed transaction is expected to close by the early third quarter. PBL and Macquarie said they would both contribute C$195 million in equity to the joint venture, along with external debt of C$975 million. PBL also owns a joint venture with Hong Kong firm Melco International Development Ltd. ( 0200.HK ), which plans to build three casinos in Macau. Macquarie shares were 2.1 percent higher at A$84.18, while PBL added 1.8 percent to A$20.21.
