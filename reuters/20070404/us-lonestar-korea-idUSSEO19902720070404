 SEOUL  (Reuters) - U.S. investment fund Lone Star said on Wednesday it was putting up two of its South Korean holdings -- a small-sized builder and a leasing firm -- for sale, confirming widespread reports of the move. 

 The fund had been widely expected by industry and market watchers to sell off its South Korean assets after a legal battle with prosecutors forced it to abort its planned $7.3 billion sale of Korea Exchange Bank (KEB) last November. "As the companies have been turned around, it is now time for them to be taken to the next level by a more strategic buyer," John Grayken, Lone Star's chairman, said in a statement. "Lone Star is still committed to Korea and retains several other significant assets in Korea," Grayken added. Lone Star also confirmed it had hired ABN AMRO to advise on sales of unlisted Kukdong Engineering and Construction Co. Ltd., and STARLease Co. Ltd.. Lone Star had bought the builder for $203 million in 2003, and the leasing firm from a South Korean bank for an undisclosed amount of money in 2002. In South Korea, the fund had been facing a public backlash against heavy tax-free capital gains made by foreign investors scooping up distressed assets in the wake of the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis. Lone Star had been forced to abandon its planned sale of lender KEB To Kookmin Bank last year, due to a probe by prosecutors about whether Lone Star's 2003 purchase of KEB was illegal. The prosecution contends KEB's losses at the time were inflated, allowing Lone Star to buy it for about a third less than it was worth, and have sought to extradite Lone Star Vice Chairman Ellis Short and general counsel Michael Thomson in relation to the deal. In Japan, Lone Star is auctioning off its roughly $1.4 billion stake in Japanese lender Tokyo Star Bank Ltd., sources had told Reuters on Tuesday, as it seeks to cash out of its six-year investment in the Japanese banking sector. The sale also comes as investors worry about the outlook for smaller construction firms, such as Kukdong, that rely on the domestic market. With raw material prices increasing, they are becoming less competitive against bigger players such as Hyundai Engineering and Construction Government measures to cool housing prices could also hurt the smaller builders. A bill passed on Monday by the National Assembly aims at capping prices for certain home sales and forces companies to disclose construction costs. Kukdong posted a 30.2 billion won net profit in 2006 on 521.3 billion won in sales. Automobile and medical equipment leasing company STARLease earned 25.4 billion won in the year ended in March, 2006. (Additional reporting by Rhee So-eui and Marie-France Han)
