 TOKYO/NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A second major investor in Nikko Cordial Corp. 8603.T sought to press Citigroup ( C.N ) to raise its $14 billion bid for the Japanese brokerage, offering its stake for sale on the open market at a 12 percent premium to the U.S. bank's takeover price. 

 Chicago-based Harris Associates joined Orbis Investment Management in offering its Nikko shares at 1,900 yen each, 200 yen above Citigroup's tender offer for Japan's third-biggest securities firm. The two investors together own a little over 10 percent of Nikko. By staking out a clear price demand they hope to press Citigroup to sweeten its offer a second time, after it raised its price from an initial 1,350 yen a share last month. David Herro, a fund manager at Harris, told Reuters on Tuesday that the firm saw its Nikko sell order as a way of "getting a price closer to what we think it's worth." Analysts described the move as largely symbolic, since other sellers are offering the stock at a much lower price. Nikko's shares, which have been trading just below 1,700 yen, briefly touched Citigroup's offer price for the first time on Wednesday before ending at 1,695 yen, 0.5 percent above Tuesday's close. "They are trying to send a message -- 'If you want Nikko so much, why don't you pay this level?'" said Ken Masuda, senior equities dealer at Shinko Securities, who added that he did not expect Citigroup to raise its bid. SCANDAL Harris Associates' Herro said the sell orders could provoke interest in Nikko from potential Citigroup rivals by showing that the brokerage was valued highly by its major investors. Hugh Gillespie, Orbis's legal counsel, said on Tuesday: "We are encouraged that other significant shareholders appear to share our view that in the circumstances of this transaction, the market should be allowed to determine the true value of Nikko Cordial and are taking steps we believe will achieve that result." Sell offers pricing Nikko at 1,900 yen totaled 136.1 million shares late on Wednesday, traders said. The number represents about 14 percent of Nikko's outstanding stock, or slightly more than Harris and Orbis' combined holding, suggesting some smaller shareholders have also joined the campaign. Citigroup declined to comment. Before it began accepting tenders on March 16, the top U.S. bank said it would not increase its bid a second time. Citigroup already holds roughly 5 percent of Nikko and is offering to buy all shares tendered as it aims for a minimum stake of 50 percent. The tender closes on April 26. Citigroup raised its original bid price after Nikko escaped a threatened delisting by the Tokyo Stock Exchange over an accounting scandal. The stock's continued listing weakened the U.S. bank's leverage against North American investors, including Harris and Orbis, who complained that the offer was too low. Management at Nikko has endorsed the Citigroup deal, which would be the biggest-ever foreign buyout of a Japanese company. One major Nikko shareholder, Mizuho Financial Group ( 8411.T ), plans to tender all of its shares in Nikko to Citigroup, a source close to the matter said last month, boosting the chances the takeover bid will succeed. Mizuho, Japan's second-biggest bank, owns a stake of just under 5 percent. (Additional reporting by  Aiko Hayashi )
