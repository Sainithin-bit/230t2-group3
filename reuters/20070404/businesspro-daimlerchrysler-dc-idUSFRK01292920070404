 BERLIN  (Reuters) - DaimlerChrysler DCXGN.DE confirmed on 
Wednesday it was holding talks with potential buyers for 
loss-making U.S. arm Chrysler, but the world's fifth-biggest 
carmaker reiterated it was keeping all options open. 

  "I can confirm that we are talking with some of the 
potential partners who have shown a clear interest," Chief 
Executive Dieter Zetsche said in remarks prepared for delivery 
to the group's annual meeting.  "But it is also true that we need to keep all options open, 
and that I cannot disclose any details, because we need to have 
the maximum scope for maneuver."  DaimlerChryselr reiterated its forecast for a significant 
increase in group profitability in 2007 through 2009.
