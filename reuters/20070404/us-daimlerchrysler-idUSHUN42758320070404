 BERLIN  (Reuters) - DaimlerChrysler DCXGn.DE acknowledged for the first time on Wednesday it was talking with prospective buyers of its loss-making Chrysler Group unit, but would not commit itself to selling the U.S. business. 

 "I can confirm that we are talking with some of the potential partners who have shown a clear interest," Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche told the annual meeting of the world's fifth-biggest carmaker. "But it is also true that we need to keep all options open, and that I cannot disclose any details, because we need to have the maximum scope for manoeuvre," he said. "So far I am satisfied with the process. Everything is going according to plan." Sources close to the situation have told Reuters that private equity groups Cerberus Capital Management CBS.UL and The Blackstone Group BG.UL plus Canadian car parts group Magna International Inc MGa.TO are front runners to buy Chrysler. The Detroit News paper said Cerberus, Blackstone and Magna had submitted formal offers and that DaimlerChrysler was expected to choose one bidder for exclusive negotiations by the end of April, hoping to get around $8 billion for Chrysler. Critical shareholders at the annual meeting wanted action. "If Chrysler is finally led before the divorce court judge, we would be very grateful," Henning Gebhardt, head of German equities for Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ) fund management arm DWS, said to applause from around 6,900 shareholders. "But what happens if you don't find a new bridegroom or if he demands an inappropriately high dowry?" Deutsche Bank has a voting stake of around 4.4 percent in DaimlerChrysler. Hans-Richard Schmitz, representing shareholder activist group DSW, told Zetsche a Chrysler sale was pressing to ensure DaimlerChrysler did not itself become a takeover target. "You can do the job yourself or a financial investor will come along and do the job for you," he said. DaimlerChrysler stock fell 1.3 percent to 61.17 euros by 1312 GMT while the DJ Stoxx European car sector index .SXAP was down 0.2 percent. "The market expected clear guidance from Zetsche on the Chrysler sale. But Zetsche only said what everyone knew already anyway," one Frankfurt trader said. "Everyone is now waiting to find out what will happen to Chrysler and until then no one will buy at such a high level," another trader said. Prospects of a deal that would reduce the group's exposure to Chrysler's volatile earnings have helped the stock outperform the index by 10 percent so far this year. Selling Chrysler would unwind the spectacular 1998 merger of Daimler-Benz and Chrysler that never lived up to its billing by former CEO Juergen Schrempp as a marriage made in car heaven. Despite the recent surge, the stock trades around 14 percent below the level where it made its market debut in November 1998. DaimlerChrysler reiterated its forecast for a significant increase in group profitability through 2009. Chrysler will absorb restructuring charges of up to 1 billion euros ($1.33 billion) in 2007, but its loss from operating activities is expected to be less than in 2006, when it lost 1.12 billion euros, the company has said in the past. Its restructuring plan will cut 13,000 jobs and close a plant as it tries to return to profit by 2008, in part by pushing more small cars and less thirsty engines. Consumers' shift to fuel-thrifty cars amid high pump prices hit Chrysler, the most reliant of the Detroit carmakers on light trucks and sport utility vehicles for profits. Its U.S. sales fell 8 percent in March when adjusted for selling days, and first-quarter sales were off 6.9 percent. -- Additional reporting by Eva Kuehnen and Ralf Banser in Frankfurt
