 PARIS  (Reuters) - NYSE Euronext NYX.PANYX.N made its market debut on Wednesday, the last step in a year-long drive to create the first transatlantic exchange with 4,000 listed companies worth $28.5 trillion in market capitalization. 

 Executives of the new group, present at the old Paris bourse for the start of trading at 0700 GMT, said the world's largest stock exchange operator would continue expanding its presence in Europe and Asia while working on integrating its operations. "We have a lot of work," Chief Executive John Than told reporters after a giant screen located on the former trading floor of the 19th century Paris bourse showed live the start of trading on the quotation page of the new stock. "The first step is to have our first board meeting tomorrow and we will start the whole process of integrating the management teams, making sure we deliver both on the revenue opportunities and expense synergies," Than added. Than said no guidance on 2007 earnings would be given. NYSE Euronext shares, which will be from now on traded both in euros and dollars for 13 hours a day, were 2.5 percent lower at 73.76 euros by 1000 GMT. Than, and former Euronext CEO Jean-Francis Theodore, the new group's deputy chief, will attempt to make it to New York in time for the NYSE's closing bell later in the day. This debut follows a nearly year-long process to merge NYSE and Euronext -- the operator of the Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels and Lisbon bourses -- to create a giant exchange with bases in Europe and the United States, and in the euro and dollar zones. NYSE Euronext has 80 of the world's 100 largest companies listed on its markets. The NYSE Euronext merger marks a key development in a 2-1/2 year industry consolidation to cut costs and increase execution speed. "We think there is the opportunity to create new products... new indexes, new futures contracts, options on those, exchange-traded funds, so there are a lot of opportunities on the revenue side," Than said. LOOKING AT ASIA The two groups committed to a $14-billion tie-up in June 2006, after Euronext rebuffed a rival offer by Deutsche Boers ( DB1Gn.DE ). Despite opposition by some Euronext stake holders, shareholders of both sides overwhelmingly backed the plan in December. NYSE Euronext, the corporation set up by the two bodies to conduct the merger, launched an exchange offer for all outstanding shares of Euronext, which was accepted by holders of 91.4 percent of the Paris-based group's shares. NYSE Euronext is due to reopen its offer in the next few days for minority shareholders. "This is the beginning of a big adventure," Theodore told Reuters on the sidelines of the inauguration. "There're going to be new adventures in the derivatives market which the NYSE has just entered, and of course Euronext remains a leading figure of consolidation for European markets." NYSE Euronext Chairman Jan Michael Hassles told reporters that the transatlantic giant was open to talking again with Deutsche Boers. "There is always a possibility," Hassles said. "We have offered them to bring their cash markets into our markets, which would result in a larger and more effective European cash equity market. The offer is still open but it's up to them to react." Looking further East, Hassles and Than reiterated NYSE Euronext's interest in expanding in Asia. "Asia certainly makes sense from a currency point of view and wealth of capital," Hessels said. Thain added: "We have a strategic alliance with Tokyo so we are building our relationship with them. They have said they planned to become a public company by 2009... We would hope to further our relationship with them between then and now."
