 KANSAS CITY, Missouri  (Reuters) - Monsanto Co. ( MON.N ) posted higher-than-expected second-quarter profit on Wednesday, due largely to continued strong sales of its genetically modified seeds, particularly corn. 

 Monsanto also said it expects its full-year 2007 earnings per share in the range of $1.60 to $1.65, both on a reported and ongoing basis. Previously, the company's full-year 2007 EPS forecast was at the upper end of the $1.50 to $1.57 range. The St. Louis-based company's shares rose 1.8 percent to $57 before the bell in response to the news. The agricultural products company, a global leader in development of biotech crops, said it earned 98 cents a share for the second quarter, which ended February 28, compared with 80 cents a share a year earlier. Analysts, on average, were looking for 93 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Net income for the second quarter totaled $543 million, compared with $440 million a year ago, the company said. Farmers' interest in planting corn this spring has surged amid a rally in corn prices and strong demand from ethanol, food and livestock feed sectors. Gains in corn seed and trait sales helped offset a decline in soybean seeds and traits, which dropped to $373 million from $449 million, according to the company. "The strong demand that we've seen for our higher-yielding corn seeds and our higher-margin, triple-trait corn technology has translated into an excellent second quarter and first half for our business," said Monsanto Chairman Hugh Grant in a statement. Monsanto said its pre-season U.S. crop estimates were consistent with a U.S. Department of Agriculture forecast for corn to be planted on as many as 90 million U.S. acres this spring. Monsanto said its triple-trait corn technology was expected to be grown on an estimated 16 million acres, up more than 160 percent. Roundup Ready corn, which is resistant to the herbicide, was expected to be planted on more than 50 million U.S. acres, Monsanto said. Monsanto said it recorded record net sales of $2.6 billion for the second quarter, up 19 percent over the same period in 2006. Along with strong U.S. corn seed and traits revenues, the company saw increased sales of its Roundup herbicide and other glyphosate-based herbicides in Brazil, the Europe-Africa region and Argentina.
