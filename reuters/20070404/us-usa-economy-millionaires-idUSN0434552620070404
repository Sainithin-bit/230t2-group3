 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Choppy markets are taking their toll on confidence among even those with the greatest wherewithal to weather any big downturns: millionaires. 

 Investor optimism among U.S. millionaires dropped sharply in March after the big stock market sell off in late February, which was followed by a month of elevated volatility across assets. The Spectrem Millionaire Investor Index fell by 14 points to a reading of 5 in March, indicating millionaires have shifted their outlook to neutral from mildly bullish the previous month. The drop was the largest one-month pullback since the survey's inception in February 2004. "Millionaires and the broader affluent population alike saw record erosion in investment optimism in March, on the heels of the global stock-market sell- off of February 27th," said George Walper, president of Spectrem Group, a consulting firm. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 416 points on February 27, its biggest point loss since the day U.S. stock markets reopened after the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington. "While that event came too late to be captured in our February index results, it clearly made a very large impression in March," Walper said. Somewhat less wealthy investors also lost confidence in the outlook last month. The Spectrem Affluent Investor Index, which measures the investment outlook of households with $500,000 or more in investable assets, fell 10 points to a level of 1, also neutral territory. "The question going forward is whether at least one of the indexes can begin to recover from this broad and deep decline, or whether this is a signal of further erosion in optimism to come," Walper said. The Spectrem Affluent Investor Index is based on 250, 10-minute telephone interviews each month, giving the data a margin of error of plus or minus 6.2 percentage points. Interviews are conducted with the financial decision-makers in households with $500,000 or more in investable assets. The Spectrem Millionaire Investor Index is based on a subset of the overall survey group that can vary each month. It is typically drawn from more than 100 monthly interviews.
