 AUSTIN, Texas  (Reuters) - Problems in the subprime mortgage market have not spread but are clouding the outlook for housing and the U.S. economy as a whole, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Richard Fisher said on Wednesday. 

 "Thus far, the damage from the subprime market has been largely contained. ... Quality problems have arisen primarily for adjustable-rate subprime loans, which are only about 8.5 percent of home mortgage debt outstanding," he told the Austin Mortgage Bankers Association. "Nevertheless, because 40 percent of homebuyers last year were non-prime ... borrowers, housing markets may feel some short-term pains, making it less clear whether housing construction has bottomed and how long the housing downturn may last. Fortunately, the financial system and the economy are strong enough to weather this storm," he said. But Fisher, who is not a voting member of the U.S. central bank's policy-setting committee this year, also stressed that inflation remained the main threat to the economy. "There is no denying that this kind of situation dampens economic growth ... I would like to see inflation lower than it currently is," he told reporters after the speech. "I am hopeful inflation will moderate, but we must always remain vigilant," he said. Subprime mortgages are extended to borrowers with poor credit histories. Rising delinquencies among such borrowers, together with credit-protection filings by several big subprime lenders, have created worries about the economy as a whole. Fisher took pains to stress that the economy remained on solid ground. "To be sure, the economy will grow somewhat more slowly because of the correction in the housing market. At the same time, other pistons in our economic engine, particularly consumption, continue pumping," he said. The Fed held interest rates steady at 5.25 percent at its last meeting. And in its policy statement, it removed an explicit reference to future policy firming -- a move seen as a step toward an eventual rate cut if growth weakens more than policy-makers currently expect. Fisher said the statement spoke for itself and left the central bank's position clear. "There is a symmetry to the statement that was issued... inflation is running at too high a rate now," he told reporters when asked if the Fed had confused markets. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke had already made plain in comments before U.S. lawmakers last week that the central bank's anti-inflation bias remain intact. However, recent soft economic data, including a report on Wednesday showing a drop in the Institute for Supply Management's services sector index in March to a four-year low, have kept alive expectations for a rate cut by mid-year. On the other hand, Fisher stressed the housing market would adjust as lower home prices attract buyers. "A build up in housing inventory means that responsible buyers will be able to buy homes at more affordable prices. We may have had a glimpse into this process in the National Association of Realtors report of pending homes sales released (on Tuesday)," he said. The National Association of Realtors said its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed in February, rose 0.7 percent to 109.3 from a downwardly revised level of 108.5 in January.
