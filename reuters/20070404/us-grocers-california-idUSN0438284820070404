 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Grocers Albertsons, Ralphs and Vons said on Wednesday they have entered an agreement giving them measures such as an employee lockout if grocery unions call a strike as they negotiate a new contract with workers in Southern California. 

 Some 65,000 workers from Bakersfield down to the Mexican border are negotiating through seven local unions of the United Food and Commercial Workers with the three supermarket chains -- Albertsons, owned by Supervalu Inc. ( SVU.N ); Kroger Co.'s ( KR.N ) Ralphs; and Safeway Inc.'s ( SWY.N ) Vons. Last month, workers at Albertsons passed a resolution giving the local unions authority to call a strike against the supermarket chain if contract negotiations break down. The grocers' agreement includes a provision calling for the lockout of employees from all three companies within 48 hours of a selective strike against any one company. The pact provides for financial assistance to any of the companies targeted by the unions in a strike, the grocers said. "The decision to sign the agreement was made only after, and in response to, the unions' strike threat," a spokeswoman for the three grocers said in a statement. "While none of us wants a work stoppage, the unions' recent strike authorization and threats of future strike votes must be taken seriously." The grocers' spokeswoman said the unions are trying to put pressure on one company to agree to "uncompetitive contract provisions and gain significant bargaining leverage against the other companies." The current labor contract, which expired on March 5 but was extended until April 9, was agreed to after a strike and lockout from 2003 into 2004 that was the longest work stoppage in the history of the U.S. grocery industry. The spokeswoman added that the grocers are committed to working toward a peaceful contract settlement. A spokesman for the seven local unions could not be immediately reached for comment.
