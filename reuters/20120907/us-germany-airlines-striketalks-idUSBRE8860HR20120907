 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Representatives of striking cabin crew will hold exploratory talks with Lufthansa ( LHAG.DE ) management on Friday afternoon, the UFO union said. 
 Cabin crew were on Friday holding a 24 hour strike across Germany, the third day of action in a row over pay and conditions, which has so far resulted in hundreds of flight cancellations and cost Lufthansa over 10 million euros ($12.64 million).
