 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Export-Import Bank said on Friday it has authorized a $2 billion direct loan to the Barakah One Company of the United Arab Emirates to purchase U.S. equipment and construction service to build a nuclear power plant. 
 "In addition to bolstering American jobs, Ex-Im Bank will make history by backing the construction of the first nuclear power plant on the Arabian peninsula," Fred Hochberg, President of the U.S. Export-Import Bank, said in a statement. (Reporting by  Doug Palmer )
