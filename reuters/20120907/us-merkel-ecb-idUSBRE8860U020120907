 VIENNA  (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel defended the European Central Bank as independent and strong on Friday following an uproar in Germany over the ECB's new bond-buying program for struggling euro zone members. 
 "The ECB is an independent and very strong institution," she told reporters when asked her opinion of the ECB plan during a trip to Vienna. She emphasized that help for struggling euro zone members would not come without strings attached. "Conditionality is a very important point. Control and help, or control and conditions, go hand in hand," she said. (Reporting by  Michael Shields  and  Georgina Prodhan ; Editing by  Noah Barkin )
