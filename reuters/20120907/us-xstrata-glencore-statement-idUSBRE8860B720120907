 LONDON  (Reuters) - Commodities trader Glencore, which earlier unexpectedly adjourned a shareholder vote on its bid for miner Xstrata, said in a statement it was "considering its options" and would update the market in due course. 
 In a brief statement shortly after the meeting in Zug, Switzerland was put back on Friday, Glencore gave no detail on the options it was considering for the $34 billion offer. In an unusual move, Glencore has also asked for its shares to be temporarily suspended in London and Hong Kong. (Reporting by  Clara Ferreira-Marques ; Editing by  Sinead Cruise )
