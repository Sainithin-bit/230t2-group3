 LONDON  (Reuters) - British bank Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ) said it could sell assets this year to help its capital position, but it is not a forced seller. 

 "On asset sales, there probably will be odds and ends, but there are no plans to sell anything other than at a decent price," said Fred Goodwin, RBS chief executive, adding this could include parts of the business it bought from ABN AMRO last year. Its train business Angel Trains is up for sale and could fetch more than 3 billion pounds ($5.94 billion). "It will remain up for sale until such time as we get a good price for it," Goodwin said. Goodwin said a recovery in financial markets could take time, after turmoil in capital markets business hurt RBS's investment banking arm in the second half of last year. "We're not going to go back to where things were, we'll find a new equilibrium in due course. It doesn't feel like it's going to happen next week or next month, but there are tentative signs that we're moving in the right direction," he told reporters on a conference call. Goodwin was speaking after RBS reported a 9 percent rise in 2007 underlying profit.  (Reporting by  Steve Slater )
