 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Sears Holdings Corp ( SHLD.O ) reported a 
47.5 percent decline in quarterly profit on Thursday on 
increased markdowns and lower sales at its Kmart and Sears 
stores. 

  The retailer controlled by hedge fund manager Edward 
Lampert said earnings fell to $426 million, or $3.17 a share, 
in the fourth quarter ended on February 2, from $811 million, 
or $5.27 a share, a year earlier.  Revenue fell to $15.07 billion from $16.18 billion.  Sales at stores open at least a year fell 4.5 percent 
companywide, with declines of 4 percent at U.S. Sears stores 
and 5.2 percent at Kmart.  Higher markdowns to clear excess inventory hurt gross 
margin, which fell to 27.7 percent from 29.7 percent a year 
earlier.  Sears Holdings, which is searching for a chief executive 
and seeking to reorganize its operations, warned in mid-January 
that quarterly profit would decline.  The Hoffman Estates, Illinois, retailer competes against a 
host of chains, including J.C. Penney Co ( JCP.N ) in clothing 
and Wal-Mart Stores ( WMT.N ) and other discounters in general 
merchandise. Home Depot ( HD.N ) and Lowe's Cos ( LOW.N ) have 
chipped away at Sears' dominant market share in appliances.  Some Sears executives have departed recently. Last week, 
the company said two longtime employees, one of which headed up 
its key appliance division, had retired.  (Reporting by  Karen Jacobs ; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
