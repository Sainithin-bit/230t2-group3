 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Alcoa ( AA.N ) has been accused of a 
15-year conspiracy involving overcharging, fraud and bribery by 
a company controlled by Bahrain, according to the Wall Street 
Journal on Thursday. 

  Aluminum Bahrain has alleged in a lawsuit filed in a U.S. 
Federal court that Alcoa steered payments for an aluminum 
precursor ingredient to a group of companies abroad, in order 
to pay kickbacks to a Bahrani government official.  The firm also alleged that Alcoa had overcharged it for the 
precursor material, alumina.  Alcoa was not immediately available for comment.  (Reporting by  Yinka Adegoke ; Editing by David Cowell)
