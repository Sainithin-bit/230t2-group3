 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Dell Inc DELL.O has cut a net 3,200 jobs of 8,800 reductions planned and sees cost savings in the multibillion-dollar range in its current fiscal year, Chief Financial Officer Don Carty said on Thursday. 

 The computer maker so far has eliminated 5,300 positions but hired 2,100 people since it announced a 10 percent work force reduction in May 2007, Carty told Reuters in an interview after Dell reported lower-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter results. "We will get to the 8,800," Carty said, adding that Dell expects one-time costs from the job cuts "that might leave us with a little bit more volatility in the next quarter or two." Carty also said the company had seen "a little bit of holding back" among U.S. financial services clients. (Reporting by  Philipp Gollner ; Editing by  Braden Reddall )
