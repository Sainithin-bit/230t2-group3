 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Sears Holdings Corp ( SHLD.O ) reported 
lower quarterly profit on Thursday as revenue fell and higher 
markdowns hurt margins. 

  The retailer controlled by hedge fund manager Edward 
Lampert said earnings fell to $426 million, or $3.17 a diluted 
share, in the fourth quarter ended on February 2 from $811 
million, or $5.27 a share, a year earlier.  Sears Holdings, which is searching for a chief executive 
and seeking to reorganize its operations, warned in mid-January 
that quarterly profit would decline.  (Reporting by  Karen Jacobs ; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
