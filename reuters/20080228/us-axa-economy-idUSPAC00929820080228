 PARIS  (Reuters) - The head of Europe's second biggest insurance company, Paris-based Axa ( AXAF.PA ), said on Thursday fears of global recession were overdone but called for vigilance on the amount of liquidity in the banking system. 

 "The sub-prime crisis and the reaction to it is above all a banking crisis. It has an indirect impact on our activities. World economic growth is largely positive even if it is slowing as a result of the United States," Chief Executive Henri de Castries told Le Monde newspaper in an interview. "Commodity prices indicate that the fears of a worldwide recession are very probably overdone. On the other hand, we have to keep an eye on the evolution of banking liquidity and its impact on the volume of credit being supplied." (Reporting by  Tim Hepher )
