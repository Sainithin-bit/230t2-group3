 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Gap Inc ( GPS.N ) said on Thursday that quarterly net profit rose, matching Wall Street forecasts, as the apparel retailer offered fewer price markdowns and tightened inventory in an effort to turn around flagging sales at its stores. 

 Gap shares rallied 5 percent after the operator of the Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic chains announced a $1 billion share buyback authorization that included purchase agreements with members of its founding Fisher family. "It's mainly the share repurchase that is making the Street happy," said Needham & Co analyst Christine Chen. She said the buyback was more than investors had expected and reinforced the idea that Gap had strong cash flow. Fourth-quarter net profit was $265 million, or 35 cents per share. That compared with $219 million, or 27 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts, on average, were expecting earnings of 35 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Gap is striving to turn around years of sliding same-store sales and reinvigorate its merchandise as well as its marketing. Last week, the president of the Old Navy chain resigned in a move that Wall Street interpreted to be a result of Murphy's frustration that recent improvements at the lower-cost chain hadn't translated into better sales. As previously reported, fourth-quarter net sales fell 5 percent to $4.7 billion while same-store sales, a key gauge of retail performance, declined 3 percent. Gap said it would raise its annual dividend to 34 cents from 32 cents a share. Gross and operating margins improved during the quarter. Operating margins, which rose to 8.3 percent in fiscal 2007 from 7.4 percent a year earlier, are expected to range from 8.5 percent to 9.5 percent for fiscal 2008, Gap said. Gap said it expects to reduce capital spending to about $500 million in fiscal 2008 from $682 million in fiscal 2007. For fiscal 2008, Gap estimated earnings of $1.20 to $1.27 a share, taking into account "a range of outcomes dependent in part on product acceptance and the volatile macroeconomic environment." Wall Street analysts, on average, have been expecting fiscal 2008 earnings of $1.23 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Gap, which operates more than 3,000 stores around the globe, is valued at 16 times estimated 2008 earnings, a premium to Limited Brands Inc ( LTD.N ) and Macy's Inc ( M.N ), at nearly 15 and 13, respectively. Gap shares rose to $20.50 in after-hours trading. They closed down 2.11 percent, or 42 cents, at $19.45 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by Alexandria Sage, editing by Richard Chang)
