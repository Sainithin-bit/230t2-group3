 LONDON  (Reuters) - Britain's largest insurer Aviva ( AV.L ) said on Thursday its target of doubling earnings per share by 2012 could, if met, leave room to increase the dividend beyond its current annual growth rate of 10 percent. 

 "There is some logic in the assertion that there may be room to increase the dividend over and above the growth rate today. We'd love to do that, but we can't make that prediction," Chief Executive Andrew Moss told reporters on a conference call. "We are setting ourselves a target which if successful may well create room," he said. Aviva also said its exposure to U.S. bond insurers was "de minimis", adding it would not be a forced seller if the so-called monolines are downgraded. (Reporting by  Clara Ferreira-Marques )
