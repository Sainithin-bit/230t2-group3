 LONDON  (Reuters) - UK insurer Aviva beat forecasts with 1 percent rise in 2007 profit, as strong growth in life sales offset the heavy cost of Britain's summer floods, and said it aimed to double earnings per share by 2012. 

 Britain's largest insurer, which left some analysts and investors disappointed last year with a lack of detail in newly appointed chief executive Andrew Moss's strategy, also unveiled plans to integrate its 15 asset management businesses. It said increasing profit from those units, rebranded "Aviva Investors", along with existing cost and sales targets would help it double its 49.2p 2007 EPS by 2012 at the latest. "It's a brave move and ambitious, given we are in a global slowdown, and it is never easy to drive a life business forward in a slowdown," analyst Kevin Ryan at ING said. Aviva had said last year it would use earnings per share as a growth measure. Aviva's shares, badly hit in the recent stock sell-off, jumped more than 6 percent in early trade on Thursday -- fuelled by the profit target, fresh reassurance on its limited exposure to risky U.S. assets and a reduced sensitivity to market volatility after the timely sale of 3.4 billion pounds ($6.7 billion) of equities last autumn. At 0637 EST, the shares were up 2.6 percent at 626p. Aviva's 2007 operating profit, on a European embedded value (EEV) basis, edged up to 3.29 billion pounds ($6.52 billion). Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a drop to 3.05 billion. Statutory operating profit, on which the dividend is based and is worse hit by lower investment gains, was 2.23 billion pounds, down 15 percent but in line with expectations. Aviva said it would increase its 2007 dividend by 10 percent to 33p as expect but indicated its new statutory earnings target -- suggesting a compound annual growth rate of 15 percent -- could mean a faster dividend growth rate in the future. "There is some logic in the assertion that there may be room to increase the dividend over and above the growth rate today," Moss, who took the helm last July, said. "We are setting ourselves a target which, if successful, may well create room." FLOOD LOSSES HIT The insurer said last month that a higher-than-expected 475 million pound impact from flood losses meant its combined operating ratio -- costs and claims as a percentage of premiums -- would be 100 percent, missing a key 98 percent target. As a result, the general insurance unit saw operating profit fall 39 percent to 1.03 billion pounds. Analysts warned a 832 million helping hand from prior year reserves could be unsustainable, but Aviva said there may be more to come. Aviva also said it was considering renegotiating its reinsurance for multiple "weather events" in order to help ease the initial charge if the freak floods or storms were repeated. The engine behind the group's growth, however, was its life business, with its strong U.S., UK and European units boosting profit by 35 percent to 2.75 billion pounds. In the United States, where life profit rose 29 percent, Aviva said it expected to remain resilient to a slowdown. In the more problematic Dutch market, Aviva said it was in talks with the management of unit Delta Lloyd -- whose future has been the focus of market speculation -- but signaled strong investor returns meant the business was still valuable to the group. In its core UK market, which still accounts for a third of the group's total life profit, life profit rose 16 percent, and Aviva did not see a repeat of 2006 charges to cover the cost of customers cashing in policies early. The group said it expected the UK market to slow in 2008 but remained positive its own performance would beat competitors'. Aviva is embroiled in negotiations to reallocate surplus assets in two of its funds. It warned that delays in negotiations meant that, since the summer, 50,000 policyholders had already lost out on payments by leaving. Aviva said on Thursday its balance sheet was not materially affected by the global credit turmoil, adding it had reduced its exposure to market volatility by selling 3.4 billion pounds of equities in its general insurance shareholder funds and UK pension scheme in the autumn, switching to bonds.
