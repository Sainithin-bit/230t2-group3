 LONDON  (Reuters) - Britain's largest insurer Aviva ( AV.L ) 
beat expectations with a 1 percent rise in 2007 operating 
profit as strong growth in the U.S. and European life divisions 
helped offset the heavy cost of Britain's summer floods. 

  Aviva said operating profit, on a European embedded value 
(EEV) basis, rose to 3.29 billion pounds ($6.52 billion) from a 
restated 3.25 billion pounds a year ago. Analysts polled by 
Reuters had forecast an average profit of 3.05 billion pounds, 
with estimates ranging from 2.94 billion to 3.15 billion 
pounds.  Statutory operating profit, on which the dividend is based, 
was 2.23 billion pounds, down 15 percent and broadly in line 
with the 2.21 billion pound average forecast.  The company said it was recommending a total dividend for 
the year of 33 pence, an increase of 10 percent.  (Reporting by  Clara Ferreira-Marques ; Editing by David
