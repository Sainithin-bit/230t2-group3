 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Wednesday said Congress should focus on helping workers who have lost their jobs because of trade, rather than closing U.S. markets to imports. 

 "As a general matter, I think that open trade is beneficial to the economy. There may be dislocations that occur because of trade. The better way to address those dislocations is to help those people directly rather than to shut down the trading mechanism," Bernanke told the House of Representatives' Financial Services Committee. Bernanke said exports were a current bright spot in the U.S. economic picture. "I think trade is always beneficial, but right now net exports are a positive source of demand and jobs and are helping keep our economy stronger," he said. (Editing by  James Dalgleish )
