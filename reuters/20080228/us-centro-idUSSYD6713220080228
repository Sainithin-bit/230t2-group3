 MELBOURNE  (Reuters) - At least four companies, including private equity firm Blackstone Group ( BX.N ) and a unit of General Electric Co ( GE.N ) are considering bids for Australia's Centro Properties Group CNP.AX, the Wall Street Journal reported. 

 In an article on its Web site citing people familiar with the matter, the paper said Australian property firm Mirvac Group ( MGR.AX ) and Malaysian conglomerate Mulpha International ( MITC.KL ) were also likely to bid for a controlling stake. Centro Properties, one of Australia's biggest casualties of the global credit crunch, got into trouble when it borrowed heavily, using short-term debt to finance long-term investments. It owns 700 shopping malls in the United States. Earlier this month it won a two-month reprieve from its banks on some $5 billion in debt repayments, but remains under pressure to sell assets or find a cornerstone investor. Its shares have fallen about 90 percent since it first revealed debt problems in mid-December. Officials for Centro and Mirvac declined to comment. Blackstone, Mirvac and Mulpha have been touted in local media reports as potential suitors. Centro is due to report first-half earnings on Friday. Earlier on Thursday, Chief Executive Glenn Rufrano said its affiliate, Centro Retail Trust ( CER.AX ), had a strong portfolio and a maximum possible loss from its investment in Super LLC, an entity that operates many of Centro's U.S. shopping malls, of A$1.2 billion, relieving investor concerns that its exposure may be higher. Announcing half-year earnings for Centro Retail, he also said the retail property trust's assets were widely diversified with solid tenants. Centro Retail shares closed up 30 percent at A$0.41 after his comments, having risen as high as A$0.60. They are still far below December levels of around A$1.50. Centro Properties shares rose 15 percent to $0.575. "Our property performance continues to be strong and our challenges are primarily capital markets related," Rufrano said. He said Centro Retail Trust's 419 U.S. shopping malls would not be severely hit by a U.S. economic downturn. "We will not have a significant decline in occupancy or income," he said. Centro Retail revealed a writedown of its U.S. property assets and a half-year loss of A$260.8 million, down from a profit of A$41.8 million, mainly due to a writedown in U.S. retail valuations of A$198 million. Centro Retail Trust has appointed advisers including Rothschild to help with a business review to help refinance short-term debt and consider a longer-term recapitalization. Rufrano told the briefing that the Australian property market was a strong one in which to receive full value, making it more likely to sell assets locally if required than in the United States.
