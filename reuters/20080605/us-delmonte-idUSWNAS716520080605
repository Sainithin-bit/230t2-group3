 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Del Monte Foods Co DLM.N gave an outlook for its 2009 fiscal year that was lower than Wall Street estimates and said that more price increases are on the horizon as it faces continuing pressure from rising commodity costs. 

 Company shares fell more than 10 percent even as Del Monte posted higher quarterly profit on Thursday. The company expects net sales to increase 5 percent to 7 percent in fiscal 2009, with earnings per share from continuing operations of 58 cents to 62 cents. The average forecast of analysts was 74 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. "(The) company called out accelerating cost pressure and we believe they will need to step up the pricing aggressively in cost-affected categories," said Wachovia analyst Jonathan Feeney in a research note. Price increases, combined with productivity gains, are not expected to offset costs for the first half of fiscal 2009, but are expected to during the second half of the year, CEO Richard Wolford said during a conference call with analysts. The company cited dry dog food as one area that is particularly hard hit by rising raw material costs and will face a price increase. Del Monte has already raised prices across the board this year in areas such as fruits, vegetables and pet products. The company -- which sells canned fruits and vegetables, Meow Mix cat food and Kibbles 'n Bits dog food -- said net profit was $50.4 million, or 25 cents a share, for the fiscal fourth quarter ended April 27, compared with $36.7 million, or 18 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned 29 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates, which said the average forecast of analysts was 27 cents a share. Sales rose 11.1 percent to $1.04 billion, up 11.1 percent from the year earlier period. The company, which has faced rising costs for ingredients and energy, also announced a plan to invest more in higher- margin businesses of pet products and packaged produce. Marketing also will be an increased focus for the company in 2009, said Chief Financial Officer David Meyers. "Frankly we may have squeezed marketing dollars too hard over the last two years," he said. "At this point the extreme cost head winds have actually elevated the importance of increasing our marketing spending to drive greater brand differentiation for the consumer." Del Monte in May hired William Pearce to the newly created position of chief marketing officer and is centralizing marketing operations at its San Francisco base. Del Monte shares were down $1.03 cents at $7.80 Thursday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange. (Additional reporting by  Bill Rigby  in New York; Editing by  Andre Grenon ) (Editing by Gerald E.
