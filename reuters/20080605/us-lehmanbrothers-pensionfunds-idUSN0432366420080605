 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEH.N is open to giving U.S. institutional investors access to its books to allow them to consider making investments in it, the Wall Street Journal reported on its Web site on Wednesday. 

 The paper said the investment bank had told at least one U.S. pension fund that it would give the fund information to help it consider investing in Lehman, the paper reported, citing an unnamed source. Lehman declined to comment. (Reporting by  Paritosh Bansal ; editing by Carol Bishopric)
