 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Embattled U.S. automaker Chrysler LLC made the biggest improvement in production efficiency in its North American plants in 2007, tying with Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ) as the automaker with the most productive plants, an annual study showed on Thursday. 

 The gap in productivity among Detroit-based automakers and three major Japanese rivals continued to narrow, driven by tens of thousands of worker buyouts at General Motors Corp ( GM.N ), Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) and Chrysler CBS.UL, according to the closely watched Harbour Report, released by consulting firm Oliver Wyman. However, the profitability gap between Detroit's Big 3 and the Japanese automakers remain wide, with all three Detroit automakers losing money on each vehicle they make, the report said. "Improving productivity in the face of lower production is a huge accomplishment, especially with the pressures created by rising gas prices," said Ron Harbour, partner in Oliver Wyman's North American automotive practice. "But there is a big disconnect though when you look at profitability." The Harbour report measures productivity at North American plants, calculating the labor hours needed to make vehicles. Chrysler cut its total manufacturing labor hours per vehicle by 7.7 percent to 30.37 last year, matching that of Toyota, where production hours rose from 29.93 hours in 2007. The decreased productivity at Toyota was triggered by a cut in production at its Texas and Indiana plants, which make the Tundra pickup truck. Honda Motor Co Ltd ( 7267.T ) trimmed total production hours per vehicle by 2.3 percent to 31.33 hours, while GM cut production hours by 0.2 percent to 32.29 hours and Ford productivity improved 3.7 percent to 33.88 hours. Despite declining production and shrinking market share, Detroit automakers are expected to further enhance productivity in the next few years as the effects of a new national contract with the United Auto Workers Union start to kick in.
