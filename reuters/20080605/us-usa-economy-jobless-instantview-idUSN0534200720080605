 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The number of U.S. workers filing new claims for jobless benefits fell unexpectedly last week, the government said on Thursday. 

  KEY POINTS: * Initial claims for state unemployment insurance benefits fell to 357,000 in the week ended May 31 from an upwardly revised 375,000 for the prior week, the Labor Department said. * Analysts polled by Reuters were expecting 375,000 in new claims, up from the originally reported 372,000 in the prior week. * The reported number for the latest week was lower than the lowest estimate among Wall Street economists in the Reuters poll. It was the biggest drop in six weeks. * The four-week average of new jobless claims, which is considered a more accurate measure of employment trends since it evens out weekly volatility, dipped to 368,500 in the week ended May 31 from an upwardly revised 371,250 in the previous week.  COMMENTS: CARY LEAHEY, ECONOMIST AND MANAGING DIRECTOR, DECISION  ECONOMICS, NEW YORK: "The latest jobless claims figures are yet another pleasant surprise that suggests that the ongoing recession remains shallow. "The number tells us more about the June U.S. payroll figures to be released in July than about the May employment data to be released tomorrow. These figures suggest that layoffs in June will be no worse than they were in May and that the labor market is not deteriorating any further. "Initial jobless claims have remained in an extremely tight range between 365,000 to 375,000 since late March. That's one explanation for why the monthly payroll job losses have been relatively small. Jobless claims in this range are barely at the lower edge of historical ranges for a recession; 357,000 new jobless claims is nothing to crow about, but in past business cycle downturns, that number has risen above 500,000." OMER ESINER, CURRENCY ANALYST, RUESCH INTERNATIONAL,  WASHINGTON: "We saw the dollar perk up to fresh highs of the day after the sharper than expected drop in jobless claims, however the continued hawkish rhetoric from ECB President Trichet has prompted the greenback to give up some of its overnight gains. Specifically it was the lead comment that risks to inflation have increased and him adding that prices will remain elevated for a longer than expected period. The market had positioned itself for the potential for a more dovish commentary based on weak euro zone data. We are now seeing the euro make up some of this week's losses." KIM RUPERT, MANAGING DIRECTOR, GLOBAL FIXED INCOME  ANALYSIS, ACTION ECONOMICS LLC, SAN FRANCISCO: "They support our belief that the economy is much better than many give it credit for." "We saw some okay job statistics in terms of the service sector and that continues to give some positive underlying support to the economy even if the manufacturing sector is still pretty weak." "Claims are elevated relative to where the were last year...but they still aren't recessionary. It indicates that the economy has slowed but really hasn't broken. Tomorrow's payrolls data could be anywhere from plus-50,000 to minus-50,000." KEVIN LOGAN, ECONOMIST, DRESDNER KLEINWORT WASSERSTEIN, NEW  YORK: "Not as bad as expected. However, this number is from the week that includes the Memorial Day holiday. When you have an oddity like that, it can lower the number of claims. So you have to be a little skeptical of that number. That said there was already a feeling out there that the labor market might not be deteriorating as quickly as some feared, and this data could reinforce that." ROBERT MACINTOSH, CHIEF ECONOMIST, EATON VANCE CORP,  BOSTON: "Well, depends on your perspective. If you're a bond investors they're not so hot. "I need to read more into it to see if there's something unusual in here. There may be something to do with Memorial Day not being properly adjusted here. "If this number is a legitimate number, these people who say we're not going to have a recession, they're probably correct... "That 400,000 has become a magical number for recession or no recession, this is not going in the direction of what recession people want... "I got to read more into it but no matter what, we're not imminently about to fall into recession. I think we can conclude that at least." DAVID SLOAN, ECONOMIST, 4CAST LTD, NEW YORK: "It is a little bit lower than expected but we are a little cautious on this one week's number as it included the Memorial Day weekend. Recently the trend does seem to have been stabilizing. In that sense it is an encouraging but I don't think it changes the overall picture."  MARKET REACTION: * BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices turn negative * CURRENCIES: U.S. dollar gains * STOCKS: U.S. equity index futures add to gains * RATE FUTURES: U.S. short-term interest rate futures dipped, pricing in a 0 percent probability of a 25 basis point rate cut at the Fed's June meeting, compared with a 2 percent probability late Wednesday. A 25 basis point increase by year end is fully priced into futures contracts.
