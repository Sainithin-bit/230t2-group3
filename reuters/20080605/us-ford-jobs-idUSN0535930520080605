 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) has told its U.S. salaried workers it will cut expenses for its white-collar work force by 15 percent over the next two months through job cuts, attrition and other actions. 

 "We told employees today we are going to cut salaried work force-related expenses by 15 percent and complete the actions by August 1," said Ford spokeswoman Marcey Evans. "This does include reductions in headcount and contract jobs, attrition and consolidation of positions," she said. Ford has about 24,300 salaried workers in North America. The No. 2 U.S. automaker is cutting expenses to adjust to a deeper-than-expected slump in U.S. vehicle sales, led by declines in sales of pickup trucks and SUVs.
