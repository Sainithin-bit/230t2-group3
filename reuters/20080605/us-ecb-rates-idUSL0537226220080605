 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - The European Central Bank said on Thursday it may raise rates as soon as July against a backdrop of rising inflation pressures, shocking financial markets and dashing economists' hopes of lower rates later this year. 

 ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet dropped a clear hint that rates could go up next month, saying a quarter of a percentage point rise was "possible" although not "certain". He said the Governing Council had agreed to leave rates on hold at 4 percent for this month but was determined not to fall behind the curve on tackling inflation. Some members of the ECB's 21-member policymaking council had wanted to raise rates now, some saw a case for a rate rise later and some saw no case at all, Trichet told the ECB's monthly news conference in Frankfurt. "We considered that it is not excluded that after having carefully examined the situation we could decide to move our rates a small amount in our next meeting in order to secure the solid anchoring of inflation expectations," he said. "I don't say it's certain. I say it's possible." The ECB is usually circumspect about its policy intentions, favoring code words and consensus over a frank discussion of policy disagreements, and economists were stunned by Trichet's blunt remarks. "It's a bolt out of the blue," Barclays Capital's chief European economist Julian Callow told Reuters. "One can only assume that passions were running high and there was a real split, and that's why they didn't decide to do the deed (today). Either way they have surprised the markets." The euro gained two cents against the U.S. dollar from its day's low and the yield curve for euro zone government debt inverted (short-term interest rates priced higher than long-term rates) as investors anticipated a sharp near-term increase in rates. Before the meeting, most economists had expected the ECB to keep rates on hold before cutting them towards the end of the year, though rate futures traders thought a rate rise was on the cards for late 2008. A rise in July would end a year of interest rates on hold at 4 percent, already a 6-1/2 year high. The yield on two-year government bonds rocketed more than 30 basis points to its highest this decade, 10-year yields hit 4.50 percent for the first time in nearly a year and several interest rate futures contracts had their steepest ever one-day declines. Economists at Switzerland's UBS and Italy's UniCredit, among other banks, said they were reviewing their interest rate forecasts in the light of Trichet's comments. RECORD INFLATION, WORRYING OUTLOOK The backdrop for Trichet's remarks is a rise in euro zone inflation to 3.6 percent in May, matching the level in March which was the highest since the ECB took control of euro zone monetary policy in 1999. The ECB's main job is to keep inflation just below 2 percent over the medium term -- but it has not succeeded in getting average annual inflation below this level since 1999. More recently, rising food and record fuel costs have pushed up prices and were a major factor in the ECB's staff revising up their quarterly inflation projections on Thursday. They saw inflation at around 3.4 percent on average in 2008 and 2.9 percent in 2009, assuming interest rates and commodity prices move in line with market expectations, sharply higher than forecasts just three months ago when they saw inflation at about 2.9 percent this year and 2.1 percent in 2009. Trichet said inflation would stay "above 3 percent for some time to come" shifting up a gear from oft-repeated phrase of "significantly above 2 percent." He said the latest inflation projections assumed that the pace of oil and commodity price rises would ease off and that current high inflation did not prompt a wave of rises in wages and other non-commodity prices. "The Governing Council is monitoring very closely all developments. It is in a state of heightened alertness," he said. Fellow policymaker Axel Weber later echoed Trichet's tough talk. "The ECB is not split -- we have sent a clear message to the markets about what to expect in the near future ... we have to let deeds follow words," he said in an interview with German broadcaster ARD. Kenneth Broux, economist for British bank Lloyds TSB, said the ECB had effectively set itself for a July rate rise. "They can't hold back now ... they will hike next month.," he said. "If the central bank wants to retain its credibility and inflation is way above target then it has to do something." But not all analysts believe to ECB has completely committed itself. Only 24 of 62 economists polled after the Trichet's news conference expect the ECB to up rates in July with 55 percent predicting the ECB's next move to be a hike. It's a stark contrast to a week ago when 60 percent of experts polled said they expected a pre-Christmas cut in interest rates. GROWTH BOTTOMING OUT IN 2008 Economists have long characterized the ECB as facing a dilemma over how to tackle rising inflation when the growth outlook was clouded by financial market turmoil and a U.S. slowdown. But Trichet looked increasingly as if he would resolve it in favor of tackling inflation, saying that although euro zone growth would be slightly slower in 2009 than 2008, on a quarterly basis the worst would be over by the end of this year. "Real GDP growth is projected to reach a trough in 2008 before gradually recovering thereafter," he said. "The economic fundamentals of the euro area are sound, and incoming macroeconomic data continue to point to moderate but ongoing real GDP growth." The ECB's new growth projections, which do not offer a quarterly breakdown, foresee around 1.8 percent growth in 2008 and 1.5 percent in 2009 -- versus March's 1.7 percent and 1.8 percent forecasts.
