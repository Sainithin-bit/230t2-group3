 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Regulators did a poor job of monitoring loan underwriting standards and allowed the lax lending to "get out of control," Federal Deposit Insurance Corp Chairman Sheila Bair said on Thursday. 

 "Where we did not do as well as we should have was with monitoring underwriting standards. We let it get out of control," Bair told the U.S. Senate Banking Committee. "It was being driven by the non-bank sector but banks were involved too. We are getting back to basics with banks and our supervisors, making sure people make responsibly underwritten loans," she said. (Reporting by  Emily Kaiser ; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
