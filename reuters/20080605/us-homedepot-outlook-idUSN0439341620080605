 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Home Depot Inc ( HD.N ) said on Thursday that it expects to deliver double-digit per-share profit growth annually and sales growth of 3 percent to 5 percent a year -- after current market conditions stabilize. 

 But for this year, the world's largest home improvement retailer told its analyst meeting in Atlanta that it was more comfortable with the low end of its previous outlook calling for a fall of 19 percent to 24 percent in per-share profit. "We see more negatives than positives for the remainder of this year," Home Depot Chairman Frank Blake said during the analyst meeting, which was broadcast over the Internet.
