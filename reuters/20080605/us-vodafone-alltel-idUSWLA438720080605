 LONDON  (Reuters) - Britain's Vodafone ( VOD.L ) confirmed on Thursday that Verizon Wireless, in which it has a 45 percent stake, is in advanced talks about buying U.S. rural mobile service provider Alltel Corp. 

 Verizon Wireless is close to buying Alltel for $27 billion, including debt, a source familiar with the talks told Reuters on Wednesday, in a deal that would mean it overtakes AT&T ( T.N ) as the top U.S. wireless service. (Reporting by Chris Wills,; Editing by Erica Billingham )
