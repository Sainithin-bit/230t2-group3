 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Donald Kohn on Thursday told lawmakers the U.S. central bank would act again if needed to shield the financial system from the failure of a major institution such as Bear Stearns. 

 "If something like this were coming again, I would have to make the same kind of judgments," Kohn told the Senate Banking Committee, while declining to comment on the stability of specific firms. His comments came amid reports that Lehman Brothers LEH.N is facing liquidity troubles and is in need of raising as much $4 billion. "Our judgment was that had Bear Stearns BSC.N been allowed to walk into bankruptcy court, that would have disrupted the financial system and had very serious effects on the economy," Kohn said, defending the Fed's role on brokering JPMorgan Chase's ( JPM.N ) buyout of the firm. "The situation in the second week of March in financial markets was very, very stressed and deteriorating very badly. There was a flight to liquidity and safety. That flight caught Bear Stearns, who was probably the least strong of the major investment banks," he said. But at the same time, Kohn told the Senate Banking Committee that investment banks are better positioned now in the wake of a liquidity crisis brought on by a collapse in the risky subprime mortgage debt market. "I think that the investment banks in general have taken lessons (on) what happened ... They are building their liquidity, they are reducing their leverage, they are protecting themselves from downside risks," he said. "I think we have a stronger set of investment banks than we had a month and a half ago," Kohn added. (Reporting By Joanne Morrison; Editing by Gary Crosse)
