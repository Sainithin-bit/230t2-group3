 LONDON  (Reuters) - The dollar extended gains while government bonds slipped on Thursday after the Federal Reserve chief fired a warning shot on inflation, while a firmer dollar weighed on oil and commodities which in turn pushed stocks down. 

 Both the European Central Bank and the Bank of England left their interest rates unchanged as expected with a fresh survey showing a sharper-than-expected fall in UK house prices fanning concerns about growth prospects in Britain. Fed chairman Ben Bernanke said on Wednesday rising long-term inflation expectations were a "significant concern" for policymakers, a day after he made an unusual warning about the inflationary threat from a weak U.S. currency. Investors are increasingly worried about a damaging mix of rising prices and slowing growth as the developed economies face the chilling effects from the 10-month-old credit crisis. "The inflation development is still preventing an interest rate reduction from taking place... As a consequence of a lack of interest rate reductions, growth will suffer," said Edward Menashy, Chief Economist of Charles Stanley. The dollar hit a three-month high of 106.23 yen while it rose to a one-month peak against a basket of six major currencies .DXY. The June Bund future were down 21 ticks with concerns over inflation underpinning yields. After Bernanke's hawkish comments this week, investors reckon the Fed has finished easing and it will raise interest rates by the year end. "The only question right now in the market is when will the Fed start hiking rates; lowering rates is out of the question more or less," said David Schnautz, fixed income strategist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. The FTSEurofirst 300 index  .FTEU3  was steady on the day while the MSCI main world equity index .MIWD00000PUS was down 0.3 percent, dragged lower by falls in Asia. U.S. stock futures were up across the board SPc1, indicating a firmer open on Wall Street later. Banking stocks .SX7P were steady in Europe, shrugging off comments from Moody's Investor Service which said on Wednesday it was likely to cut the top credit ratings of two U.S. bond insurers on concerns about mortgage-related losses and limited business prospects. Emerging sovereign spreads 11EMJ tightened 2 basis points while emerging stocks .MSCIEF were steady on the day. U.S. light crude were steady at $122.29 a barrel, off more than $10 from its record peak in May, while gold hit a three-week low below $870 an ounce. A stronger dollar also weighed on cooper MCU3, which hit a 11-week low. (Additional reporting by Michael Taylor and  Sarah Marsh )
