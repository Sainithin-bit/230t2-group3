 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Teen clothing retailer American Eagle Outfitters Inc ( AEO.N ) on Thursday reported a 9 percent drop in May sales at stores open at least a year, worse than expected, but stood by its second-quarter profit forecast. 

 Analysts, on average, had expected May same-store sales to fall 4.8 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. Total sales rose slightly for the four weeks ended May 31, to $200 million from $199.2 million a year earlier. The mall-based retailer operates the American Eagle Outfitters chain; aerie, which sells intimates and dorm wear for young women; and the adult sportswear chain Martin & Osa. It has struggled with its assortment of women's clothing, Net profit fell 44 percent in the first quarter and same-store sales dropped 6 percent. For the second quarter, the company said it still expects to earn 28 cents to 30 cents a share, down from 37 cents a year earlier. (Reporting by  Aarthi Sivaraman ; editing by John Wallace)
