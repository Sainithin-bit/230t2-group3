 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - The European Central Bank is in a state of heightened alertness on euro inflation, which is now expected to remain high for longer than previously thought, President Jean-Claude Trichet said on Thursday. 

 After the ECB left interest rates unchanged at 4 percent for the 12th month in a row, Trichet said the Governing Council was strongly determined to anchor inflation expectations firmly in the medium and longer term. "Risks to price stability over the medium term have increased further," he told the ECB's monthly news conference. "The Governing Council is monitoring very closely all developments. It is in a state of heightened alertness." "HICP inflation is now expected to remain high for a more protracted period than previously thought. Upside risks over the medium term are also confirmed by the continuing very vigorous money and credit growth," he added. Annual euro zone inflation accelerated in May to match a previous peak of 3.6 percent. The ECB celebrated its 10th birthday this week faced with the prospect of average annual inflation exceeding its 2 percent ceiling for 10 years in a row. Economic fundamentals of the euro area are sound, said Trichet. "We emphasize that maintaining price stability in the medium term is our primary objective." "By acting in a firm and timely manner we will prevent second round effects and ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialize," he said. "It is its our strong determination to secure a firm anchoring of medium and long term inflation expectations in line with price stability." (Reporting by  Krista Hughes ; writing by  David Stamp ))
