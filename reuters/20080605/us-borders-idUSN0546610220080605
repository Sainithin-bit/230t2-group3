 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Bookstore operator Borders Group Inc BGP.N, which put itself up for sale in March, on Thursday said it agreed to sell its 30 bookstores in Australia, New Zealand and Singapore to A&R Whitcoulis in a deal valued at up to $110 million. 

 A&R, which operates 260 bookstores including Australia's Angus & Robertson, is owned by private equity firm Pacific Equity Partners. As part of the deal, which is expected to close next week, A&R will have the right to use the Borders brand through a licensing pact. "This transaction represents an attractive valuation, permits us to forgo further investment in these businesses, and provides our company with a significant cash infusion to further reduce debt, which is one of our key financial initiatives," said Borders Group Chief Executive Officer George Jones. Earlier this week, Borders said it would cut roughly 20 percent of its corporate work force. The cuts include 156 corporate positions at its Ann Arbor, Michigan, headquarters. and 118 corporate positions at in its distribution centers, field marketing organization, and corporate sales division. Borders, the No. 2 U.S. bookseller after Barnes & Noble Inc ( BKS.N ), has been working to cut operating expenses and reduce inventory to help offset falling sales. Barnes & Noble has said it is exploring a possible acquisition of Borders. Last month, Borders said that while it is reviewing alternatives, it has not engaged in "substantive discussions regarding any specific transaction to date."
