 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Retailer Home Depot Inc ( HD.N ) said on Thursday that it is becoming less promotional and looking to focus on providing products that deliver better value to win market share. 

 "We learned that numerous promotions were not providing sales lift, and therefore have reduced unproductive promotions," Craig Menear, Home Depot executive vice president of merchandising, said during the home improvement industry leader's analyst meeting, which was broadcast over the Internet.
