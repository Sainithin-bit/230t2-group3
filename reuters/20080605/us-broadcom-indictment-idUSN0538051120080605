 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Henry Nicholas, co-founder of one of Southern California's biggest technology companies, Broadcom Corp, was indicted on Thursday on charges of using and distributing hard drugs at his home, court documents showed. 

 Nicholas and former Broadcom Chief Financial Officer William Ruehle were also named in federal criminal indictments for an alleged stock option back-dating scheme, the documents showed. A spokesman for the federal prosecutor said Nicholas surrendered to law enforcement authorities on Thursday. (Reporting by  Peter Henderson ; Editing by John Wallace)
