 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Some aspects of the credit markets are showing signs of improvement, but the biggest U.S. banks still face deteriorating credit products, the head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said on Thursday. 

 In prepared testimony for a Senate Banking Committee hearing, Comptroller John Dugan said big banks must carefully watch their exposure to worsening conditions in the commercial real estate market and in construction lending. The biggest U.S. banks have raised more than $100 billion in capital since October in public and private offerings to strengthen their balance sheets. "With these all good signs of progress, we clearly are not out of the woods," Dugan said. (Reporting by  John Poirier , Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
