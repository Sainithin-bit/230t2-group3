 LONDON  (Reuters) - The Bank of England held interest rates at 5 percent for the second month running on Thursday despite evidence almost daily the economy is braking sharply and signs the housing market could be in for a hard landing. 

 The reason is that inflation is running a full percentage point above the central bank's target and is expected to go higher still as oil and food prices soar across the world. In Frankfurt, European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet revealed that euro zone policymakers are even contemplating raising interest rates next month to beat back inflation. Money markets had priced in almost no chance of a reduction at this month's BoE Monetary Policy Committee meeting and now predict British interest rates rising by the end of the year. But analysts say the BoE will soon have to cut rates again -- borrowing costs have already come down three times since December -- to bolster an economy battered by a global credit crunch and rising household bills. "The economy is clearly slowing and the housing market has deteriorated sharply, so the MPC will need to cut rates later this year to head off the risk of a recession," said John Hawksworth, head of macroeconomics at PricewaterhouseCoopers. Figures out while policymakers were still in conference showed British house prices plunged 2.4 percent last month alone. More than 12,000 pounds has been wiped off the value of the average home over the last year.  With two-thirds of British households owning their homes, consumer confidence has crumbled and voters have lost faith with Prime Minister Gordon Brown's Labour government. Political pressure for a rate cut to ease the troubled housing market is growing. Lawmakers pressed finance minister Alistair Darling in parliament just before the BoE decision to get the central bank to worry less about inflation and more about growth. He replied that monetary policy is a matter for the independent central bank but BoE policymakers are braced for more opprobrium as the economy faces what Governor Mervyn King has called the most challenging time in more than a decade. INFLATION, INFLATION The main problem is that the BoE's mandate is to keep inflation at 2 percent. It's now at 3 percent and set to rise because commodity prices and the fall in sterling. Policymakers fear reducing interest rates when inflation is so far above the 2 percent target would risk the BoE's credibility such that higher prices would become entrenched in people's minds, a concern for central bankers around the world. The European Central Bank also kept rates unchanged on Thursday and after Trichet's comments is expected to raise them twice later this year. The U.S. Federal Reserve is also getting more worried about inflation and markets are betting interest rates could rise there before the end of the year despite no sign the housing crash is about to end. Fears are growing Britain's housing market could also be headed for a full-blown crash as cash-strapped lenders make it harder for prospective buyers to raise mortgages. Many economists are forecasting falls in double-digit house price falls this year and next, raising the prospect of millions once again in negative equity -- when mortgage debt exceeds the value of their homes. So far a buoyant jobs market should make that less of a problem than it was in the early 1990s. But a survey on Wednesday showed companies in the service sector, which makes up three-quarters of the economy -- cut jobs for the first time in more than a decade. "The cost of keeping interest rates higher for longer in order to slay the inflation dragon will be a more severe and longer-lasting downturn in activity," said Roger Bootle, economic adviser to Deloitte.
