 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Children's Place Retail Stores Inc ( PLCE.O ) said on Thursday that sales at stores open at least a year rose a better-than-expected 10 percent in May, led by strength at mall and outlet stores. 

 Wall Street had expected a same-store sales gain of 4.3 percent, according to Thomson Reuters Estimates. Same-store sales had risen 6 percent in the year-earlier month. The children's clothing retailer said total sales rose 19 percent to $109.4 million in the four weeks ended May 31. Same-store sales rose at outlet and mall stores for the month, but fell in a low single-digit percentage range at non-mall stores, the company said on a recorded call. Internet sales more than doubled. The company said it had closed one namesake store in May. Former Chief Executive Ezra Dabah, a board member who owns 17 percent of Children's Place, has been pushing for a sale of the company and has said he might buy it outright at $24 a share. Children's Place shares closed on Wednesday at $34.21. In May, the company sold its Disney store chain back to Walt Disney Co ( DIS.N ). Children's Place now operates about 900 namesake stores.
