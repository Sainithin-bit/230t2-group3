 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The world's traditional and new economic powers hope to make progress this week on creating a complex new mechanism to detect and fix problems that could otherwise lead to a new global economic crisis. 

 Finance chiefs from the Group of 20 meet on Thursday night and Friday to try to make headway with the guidelines for taking the temperature of individual economies. The new system would not be binding and would instead apply peer pressure to countries with policies seen to put the world economy at risk. In February, the G20 wrangled over the indicators to monitor, with China opposed to inclusion of foreign exchange issues, but agreed on three broad parameters: 1) Public debt and fiscal deficits 2) Private savings and investment 3) Trade interactions, including the merchandise trade balance and net investment flows. Now the G20 must agree on how to apply these guidelines to see if the policies of member countries are leading to imbalances with other nations, such as excessive trade surpluses or deficits, that could destabilize global growth. Then, any country deemed to be risky would undergo further analysis to see what corrective policies it should adopt. Following are some questions and answers on how the G20 arrived at this point and where it hopes to go from here. WHERE DID THE IDEA OF INDICATIVE GUIDELINES COME FROM? After the 2007-2009 financial crisis, policymakers began searching for ways to make the world economy more stable. They quickly identified mounting trade deficits in countries like the United States and corresponding surpluses in others like China as one key source of instability. The United States' claim that China's undervalued currency was a reason for out-of-kilter trade, and China's retort that the United States was to blame for overconsumption, produced argument and little action. So G20 political leaders agreed in November to launch an effort to find a set of indicators that could be used to assess each economy without necessarily singling out one or two. WHY IS IT TAKING SO LONG TO GET THIS PROCESS IN PLACE? Each nation faces unique circumstances so it's easy for countries to argue that certain criteria do not apply to them. At the February meeting of the G20 in Paris, China refused to agree that currency exchange rates were an acceptable gauge because Beijing felt it would lead to more pressure to let the yuan rise in value. China, now the world's No. 2 economy, says it is still a developing country and will allow more currency flexibility but only at a controlled pace that does not cause disruption. Similarly, there was disagreement over a proposal to use current account balances, which include capital flows as well as merchandise trade flows, as a gauge of imbalances. China, as the largest holder of foreign currency thanks its surging exports, was sensitive about being assessed on its huge current account surplus that includes interest earnings on nearly $3 trillion of accumulated foreign exchange reserves. SO WHAT DO THEY HOPE TO ACHIEVE IN THIS MEETING? The G20 hopes to complete a first stage of the process this week by deciding how to apply guidelines for each of the three main areas of economic activity that it wants to assess. That might be done through computer modeling and, if so, likely will mean that a variety of models will be applied to eliminate any doubt if an imbalance is signaled. G20 sources told Reuters that four different models for identifying imbalances are under discussion. "So what I think we will try to agree -- and I think it will go through one way or another -- is to use a combination of these methods," one of the sources said. WHAT HAPPENS IF ECONOMY SHOWS IMBALANCES? That would trigger stage two of the process -- something that has yet to be worked out in detail over the summer and early fall. Essentially, stage two comprises consultations under the auspices of the International Monetary Fund aimed at drawing up measures to reduce the imbalances. A U.S. official said the intent would be to "delve further into the potential root causes and impediments to adjustment" and to get policies in place during the second half of this year to start to eliminate the causes of imbalances. Ideally, the system will be agreed and implemented ahead of a meeting of G20 political leaders in Cannes on November 3-4, capping France's year as G20 president. WOULD EACH COUNTRY FACE THE SAME TESTS FOR IMBALANCES? That's unclear at this point but it is apparent that because imbalances in some economies pose greater risks than others, the biggest ones will get special scrutiny. French and U.S. officials stress that "systemic economies" -- so big that they could hurt the global financial system -- will get extra attention and will be urged to change course quickly if necessary. "I do expect a shortlist of countries to emerge from this process and that those countries will be the focus of the second state of analysis," a U.S. official said though that list won't come before the summer. CAN ANYTHING GO WRONG IN GETTING THIS PROCESS INTO PLACE? G20 members are still trying to agree not only on how to apply methods for identifying imbalances but also on how the IMF would work with countries to ensure policies are changed. Probably the biggest challenge is how to persuade countries that global economic stability is more important in the long run than sovereign interests, if policy fixes are prescribed. China warned this week that it won't agree to anything that looks like a "political tool" to rein in its trade surpluses, which would mean allowing the yuan to rise more rapidly. U.S. officials said this week that "a key challenge" was to ensure that exchange rates were permitted to play a role in reducing economic imbalances -- leaving Beijing and Washington sounding the same discordant notes that they have for years.
