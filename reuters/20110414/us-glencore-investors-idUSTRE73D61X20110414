 LONDON  (Reuters) - Glencore's long-awaited plans for a $12.1 billion stock market listing have drawn a cool response from investors, wary of paying over the odds for the secretive trader so close to the top of a commodities boom. 

 Fund managers running billions of dollars in assets across Asia, Europe and North America flagged concerns that the bumper offering may prove too expensive for them, especially if Glencore demands a hefty premium for its shares. "...Commodities prices have had quite a big rise over the last year and profits from the company (Glencore) are up about 60 percent so you're actually buying it on a greater valuation that you would 12 months ago," UK-based Cavendish Asset Management Fund Manager Paul Mumford told Reuters Insider. Swiss-based Glencore ended months of speculation about its future ownership on Thursday after unveiling a record-breaking share sale plan aimed at boosting its financial firepower and securing key M&A targets. Around $5 billion of the projected proceeds earmarked for capital expenditure including, but not limited to, fresh investment in subsidiaries and new markets. But some prospective investors still doubt its motivations for listing. "Some of the rationale is quite woolly," said one prospective investor, who requested anonymity until his company had decided to participate in the offer or not. "Ultimately we think they want the public markets to value the business so they can try and merge with Xstrata, create a super-group and crystallize some value for partners. There are a few partners cashing out and they just don't have the finance in place to let them go," the investor added. Another would-be shareholder told Reuters he was unconvinced by Glencore's hefty $60 billion valuation and that he hoped a Friday lunchtime meeting with Morgan Stanley analysts would shed light on how the business generates revenues. GOVERNANCE Concern about the quality of corporate governance at Glencore were further inflamed by decisions to appoint BP's ex-CEO Tony Hayward and Peter Coates, former chairman of Glencore subsidiary Minara Resources, as independent directors. Hayward stepped down as BP CEO in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico last year, which killed 11 men and triggered the worst oil spill in U.S. history. The late appointment of 71-year old former French Foreign Legionnaire Simon Murray, which was announced several hours after the company said it intended to float, also provoked some disquiet. "Good succession planning is a hallmark of good governance. Too often the boards of companies seeking to achieve an IPO cobble their boards together at the eleventh hour. The shares ultimately get the governance discount they deserve," said a spokesman for UK funds firm Standard Life Investments. Koen Bosquet, senior fund manager at Dexia Asset Management said his team would conduct full due diligence on the offer but a recent spate of canceled European IPOs showed fund managers were being very cautious about the companies they backed. "When they consider price, a lot of investors will be looking at the lack of history on disclosure, the company has been closed off for 30 years. They will want to see a discount." "We will be looking closely at the allocation of the capital being raised. From what we understand, a lot of it will be used to finance growth and M&A which is obviously good but it remains to be seen what projects they will actually invest in and whether they can avoid the risks of over-paying for something." Glencore plans to pay a $1 billion dividend in its first year as a listed company, starting with a maiden interim payout of $350 million in August but some investors are skeptical it will deliver on pledges to implement a "progressive" dividend policy over the long term. John Arnold, managing director of AGF International Advisors, said Glencore was a good example of a company that might seek to retain the vast bulk of profits within the business rather than hand back large sums to shareholders. "It is important to us that a company has been visible to the market for a minimum of three years, preferably five years," he said, pointing out one of his key criteria for selecting stocks.
