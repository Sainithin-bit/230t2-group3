 LONDON  (Reuters) - Glencore is set to name its non-executive chairman "shortly" once it has ironed out final details, Chief Executive Ivan Glasenberg said on Thursday, after the commodities giant launched its long-awaited public offering. 

 The world's largest commodities trader, confirmed earlier in an intention-to-float document that it plans to raise up to $12.1 billion in a London and Hong Kong listing, but surprised many in the markets by failing to name its new chairman. "It is an important decision, we are just working through the final process. We have chosen someone, so we should announce it shortly," Glasenberg said in a telephone interview with Reuters, declining to comment further. Three candidates were on the shortlist days before the document was published, including former French Foreign Legionnaire Simon Murray and two others. The new chairman will sit on an eight-strong board alongside Glasenberg. Glasenberg, who joined the group as a coal trader in 1984, said the company was ready for "the next stage of its development" and said he was confident the IPO would now proceed, ending months of speculation. "If markets tank or the world has turmoil, of course you would have to pull back, but if the world stays steady and things remain as they are today, there is no reason things should not go ahead," he said. Glencore's more flexible capital structure will allow it to chase "bigger deals," Glasenberg said, but he declined to comment on its intentions toward Swiss miner Xstrata, in which the company owns a 34 percent stake.
