 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Below are highlights of comments on Thursday from officials attending the International Monetary Fund and World Bank spring meetings. 

 Finance officials from Group of Seven industrialized nations and the Group of 20 major economic powers will meet in conjunction with the IMF and World Bank meetings. ON GLOBAL ECONOMY, IMBALANCES FRENCH ECONOMY MINISTER CHRISTINE LAGARDE ON SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT COUNTRIES "On the systemically important countries, I think we have proposed to define them as those representing 5 percent, or more than 5 percent of global GDP. That is the threshold we consider as appropriate and relevant." (A senior official in Lagarde's cabinet later said she meant to say 5 percent of G2O GDP) "The first thing is to agree on the guidelines and then we will have to discuss whether or not we issue, publish, comment or communicate the list of countries that actually qualify under the guidelines." IMF MANAGING DIRECTOR DOMINIQUE STRAUSS-KAHN ON CRISIS "We are still in a crisis, and the consequences of this crisis are still very strong, not only in Europe but importantly in Europe. STRAUSS-KAHN ON CAPITAL CONTROLS "For decades, this institution has said capital controls are just evil, we don't want it, we are fighting against it, and each and every country putting in place capital controls will be bashed by the IMF." "We are taking a more pragmatic view now...saying sometimes it may be useful..." "From the point of view of the institution, yesterday capital controls were not in the tool box but today capital controls are in the tool box." LESETJA KGANYAGO, G24 CHAIR AND DIRECTOR-GENERAL OF SOUTH AFRICA'S NATIONAL TREASURY, ON CAPITAL CONTROLS "You can't just say there are these inflows that are coming into developing countries without dealing with the source of the problem." "Capital controls ... like taxes are a sovereign issue. It's a question of how countries feel they have to respond to a surge in capital flows." GERMAN DEPUTY FINANCE MINISTER JOERG ASMUSSEN ON CAPITAL CONTROLS "There was broad agreement...that under normal circumstances the free flow of capital is the most beneficial for countries as well as the system as a whole." "What we are looking at is can we define situations and criteria, where one can use this instrument (capital controls) and do that in a multilaterally agreeable way -- we are not yet there (yet)." LAGARDE ON ROLE OF SPECIAL DRAWING RIGHTS "We have the role of the special drawing right -- is it going to be the currency of the future and is it going to be the reserve currency for all? I doubt it, I think it's a far-fetched objective, but can we not use the special drawing right and the underlying basket of currencies to actually establish the value of the SDR, as a way to entice all partners, including our Chinese colleagues, to actually cooperate more in the exercise? I think that's a route that we need to address." Asked if she expects progress on this front at the G20 meeting this week, she said: "Yes, of course, because I'm desperately optimistic". STRAUSS-KAHN ON THE NEED FOR MORE JOBS "Why do I say it's not the recovery we want? ... Not only because of (global) imbalances. You may remember exactly one year ago my concern was we may have a recovery without jobs ... "It's too much to say it's a jobless recovery but it's certainly a recovery without enough jobs ... There will be a lot of challenges to deal with, especially because of youth unemployment." LAGARDE ON COMMODITIES "It is not France's intention or desire, whether hidden or disclosed, to set prices ... Why would we use a recipe that has failed? What is of concern is excessive volatility of prices." "It's not all about position limits, there are a series of other measures which must be agreed upon: the engagement to make inventories and production levels transparent." "It's important that we arrive at a coordinated, harmonized framework which allows us to fight against arbitrage (between regulations in different countries) and against excesses." "As far as derivatives of commodities are concerned, equally we are not suggesting corridors for prices nor do we want to eliminate speculation, because we understand that there has to be speculation if only for hedging purposes, but we need to have in place a system where transactions including on derivatives are actually reported, known and we want for the supervisor to be able to intervene in case there are excesses." ON GREECE, EUROPEAN DEBT WOES LAGARDE ON GREECE "We agreed a plan which was a two-way street ... Greece was to consolidate from a fiscal point of view and was to structurally reform its market." "There are cops to check that the plan is delivered against. The cops are the IMF, the Commission, the ECB. The three of them over the last installments have said ... the Greeks are doing what they have promised to do." "That's where it stands. There is a plan, there is delivery, there are (financial) installments. There is no discussion of debt restructuring as far as Greece is concerned. None whatsoever." STRAUSS-KAHN ON GREECE "I do (believe Greece can make it)... I understand how painful it is for the Greek people but I think Greece will make it. "Greece will make it provided two things: first, that all areas of the program are really implemented in due time... "Some part of what has been done is not working as well as we expected. For instance, the richest people in the country are still not paying the taxes they would pay in any other European country. Second, what the Europeans have committed to do has to be done too...There is the need of a more comprehensive plan from the European side. The piecemeal approach dealing with one day interest rates, another day something else is not working well." EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AND MONETARY AFFAIRS COMMISSIONER OLLI REHN ON GREECE "We do not see debt restructuring as an option." "Instead we are engaged in a revised and updated debt sustainability analysis, which we will do with the IMF and present in due course."
