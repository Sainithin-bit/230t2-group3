 LONDON  (Reuters) - Trading giant Glencore is set to step out after 37 years in the shadows with the launch of a potentially record IPO that will turn publicity-shy executives into paper millionaires and propel the firm into the limelight. 

 Founded in 1974 by Marc Rich, a trading sensation who fell foul of U.S. authorities, Glencore has grown into the world's largest commodities trader, with subsidiaries employing tens of thousands, and an oil division with more ships than Britain's Royal Navy. Glencore, valued by one analyst this year at $60 billion, began as a pure trader of metals, minerals and oil under Rich. It bought its first industrial assets in the late 1980s and has since turned into a diversified conglomerate with assets ranging from Zambian copper mines to farmland across South America. It joins the dots of the global economy, mining, producing and shipping raw materials across the globe to carmakers, oil companies, utilities, steelmakers and food giants. Belgian-born Rich sold his stake in 1994. One of the world's largest oil suppliers, Glencore handles 3 percent of the world's daily oil consumption. It is also one of the largest physical suppliers of metals including zinc, lead and nickel and the biggest supplier of seaborne coal. Glencore is an unusually diversified conglomerate, but its closest rivals are agribusiness giant Bunge, food producer Cargill, commodity trader Louis Dreyfus and energy traders Trafigura and Vitol. Based in Baar, Switzerland, Glencore has until now held on to a prized tradition of public discretion, with its chief executive and other top managers largely anonymous outside its business circles. That will likely change with a listing that will net each of them millions in shares and shine a light on bumper bonuses that would put even bank executives' pay packages in the shade. Glencore says it already discloses financial detail publicly, due to its debt, and insiders have dismissed the notion that operating in public will harm their business. A large part of Glencore's market value will be made up of its listed stakes, most importantly 34 percent in Swiss miner Xstrata. Glencore has said publicly it would see "good value" in a merger with Xstrata but that has not so far been supported by Xstrata shareholders. At current market prices, Glencore's listed stakes alone are worth around $31 billion. The group is run by Ivan Glasenberg, an intense, charming South African who joined the firm as a coal trader in 1984. Glasenberg is thought to own as much as 15 percent of the company but has never confirmed his stake. Glencore, which insiders liken to a logistics business rather than a bank's trading operations, divides its business into three divisions, metals and minerals, energy and agricultural products. Its listed holdings are placed under a separate "corporate" heading. In 2010, Glencore boosted its core profit almost 60 percent to $6.2 billion, boosted by 30 to 45 percent price rises in its key metals, particularly copper, zinc and nickel. Glencore has said it will continue to focus on long-term returns. Over the past decade it has delivered an impressive 38 percent return on equity per year.
