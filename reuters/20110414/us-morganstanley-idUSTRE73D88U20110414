 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) Chief Executive Officer James Gorman's total compensation reached $15.2 million in 2010, according to a regulatory filing on Thursday. 

 That is 134 percent more than the $6.5 million he made in 2009, based on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's compensation formula. Lloyd Blankfein, CEO of larger rival Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ), made $14.1 million on the same basis. By way of comparison, the real median U.S. household income was just $49,777 in 2009, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Large pay packages for bank executives remain a touchy subject following the financial crisis. Morgan Stanley is the second-largest U.S. investment bank. It earned $4.7 billion in 2010. In 2009, after the financial crisis brought it to the brink of failure, it began reducing its reliance on trading and risk-taking for profit, and shifted its focus to areas such as wealth management, where revenue is more stable. Analysts on average expect the bank to earn about 34 cents per share when it reports first-quarter results next Thursday. Analysts with the best records of predicting results anticipate a profit of only 31 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters data. A weak trading environment is expected to slam Morgan Stanley and other investment banks as they report first-quarter earnings this month. The stock market during the quarter sagged on Middle Eastern political upheaval and a Japanese earthquake and tsunami sending the yen to record highs, and markets were broadly unpredictable. Based on Morgan Stanley's calculations, CEO Gorman took a cut in compensation, to $14 million in 2010 from $15 million in 2009. Morgan Stanley calculates 2010 compensation based on the cash, bonus and other compensation paid to Gorman for his work in 2010, even if part of that compensation -- like the bonus -- is awarded at a different time. The SEC's 2010 compensation calculation includes everything awarded in 2010, including any bonus payouts, as well as cash and other compensation. By Goldman's calculations Blankfein out-earned Gorman, making $18.6 million. Morgan Stanley shares closed flat at $26.79 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday.
