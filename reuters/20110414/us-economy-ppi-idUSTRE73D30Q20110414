 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. core producer prices rose slightly faster than expected in March and the increase from a year ago was the largest since August 2009, pointing to a broadening in pipeline inflation pressures. 

 The Labor Department said on Thursday its seasonally adjusted index for prices paid at the farm and factory gate - excluding volatile food and energy costs -- rose 0.3 percent after gaining 0.2 percent in February, Economists had expected core PPI to rise 0.2 percent in March. Light trucks prices, which advanced 0.7 percent, accounted for a third of the rise in core PPI last month. The increase in light truck prices was the biggest since July. Passenger vehicle prices increased 0.9 percent, the largest increase since June 2009. In the 12 months to March, the core producer price index rose 1.9 percent, the biggest increase since August 2009, after gaining 1.8 percent in February. March's increase was in line with market expectations. The increase in headline PPI, however, slowed to 0.7 percent after surging 1.6 percent in February. Economists polled by Reuters had expected PPI to rise 1 percent last month. In the 12 months to March, producer prices increased 5.8 percent, the largest gain in a year, after rising 5.6 percent in February. Although rising gasoline prices are exerting upward pressure on inflation at the production level, the Federal Reserve largely views this as transitory. Officials have, however, said they would act if necessary to ensure that an inflation psychology does not take root. Energy prices, which rose 2.6 percent, accounted for nearly 90 percent of the increase in wholesale prices last month. Energy prices rose 3.3 percent in February. Gasoline prices rose 5.7 percent after increasing 3.7 percent in February. Food prices fell 0.2 percent, the first decline since August. (Reporting by  Lucia Mutikani ; Editing by  Neil Stempleman )
