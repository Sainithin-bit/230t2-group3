 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve has done enough monetary easing for now, but there is no need to pull back on current bond-buying plans either, Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo said during a panel discussion on Thursday. 

 Asked about the prospect of a new round of bond purchases beyond the Fed's existing $600 billion program, Tarullo was non-committal. "I make it a policy of not pre-judging what my view of what a particular monetary policy action would be at any given moment. So I'm not going to address that question," he said. "With respect to the $600 billion large-scale asset policy put in place in November I don't see any need to either terminate it prematurely or to increase it."
