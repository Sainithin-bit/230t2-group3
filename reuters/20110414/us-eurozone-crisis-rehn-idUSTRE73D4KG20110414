 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The euro zone is entering the final stage of dealing with its sovereign debt crisis as Portugal's request for EU/IMF aid should "ring-fence" the problem, Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn said. 

 "I cannot say 'mission accomplished' yet, but we are entering the end-game of crisis management," Rehn said in a speech at the Brookings Institution. Markets had been looking at Spain as the next potential candidate for a bailout from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund after Portugal. Spanish labor and banking sector reforms seemed to have calmed down investors. This raised hopes among euro zone policymakers that the crisis, which started with Greece in early 2010, was finally coming to an end. "With the Portuguese program we should be able to ring-fence the problem," Rehn said, adding the Portuguese request for aid did not boost borrowing costs for neighboring Spain. "It is almost universally recognized that Spain has decoupled from the other three countries," Rehn said, referring to the three benefactors of EU/IMF aid -- Greece, Ireland and Portugal.
