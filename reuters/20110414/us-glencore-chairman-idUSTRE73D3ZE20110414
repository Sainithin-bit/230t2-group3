 LONDON  (Reuters) - Few things daunt Simon Murray, a former French Foreign Legionnaire who fought in the Algerian war, climbed Everest and walked unsupported to the South Pole. 

 But as chairman of the soon-to-be-listed commodities giant Glencore, he will face some of his toughest challenges yet -- standing up to some of the hardest men in the business and convincing investors to back a company that remains opaque to many after operating out of the public eye for 37 years. "This is very exciting, but you are talking to someone who has been chased by a leopard. You are talking to someone who has been shot at with a machine gun and missed," Murray, 71, told Reuters outside his Hong Kong offices earlier this week. Murray, currently chairman of Asian private equity firm GEMS, was appointed non-executive chairman of Glencore, the world's largest diversified commodities trader, on Thursday. His appointment -- not unexpected after he was named as a candidate earlier in the week -- was not included in initial intention-to-float documentation published by the firm, but came only hours later, after Glencore ironed out final details. The delay has already irked investors. Murray will sit on the board alongside Chief Executive Ivan Glasenberg, Chief Financial Officer Steven Kalmin and five non-executive directors led by former BP boss Tony Hayward. He has said he will seek to make his mark on the board. "It's absolutely critical that the board understands what its role is," he said this week. "In today's markets we are permanently under the microscope, and we have to make sure we covered and ticked all the boxes. Among his previous roles, Murray was managing director of Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-Shing's Hutchison Whampoa and serves on boards including Richemont and Essar Energy. He has also served on the Vodafone board alongside John Bond, who was last month appointed chairman of Xstrata, in which Glencore owns a 34 percent stake. Murray, a member of the Hong Kong elite, has spent 45 years in Asia and his Hong Kong connections will be valuable to Glencore, planning a dual Hong Kong and London listing. Murray, whose tales of derring-do include carrying two severed heads in his backpack during his time in the French Foreign Legion, was born in Leicester in central England. As a teenager in 1960 he joined the Foreign Legion on a whim, going on to fight for five years in Algeria. He later wrote a bestseller, "Legionnaire," about his time in north Africa. It was made into a film in 2002. Educated at Bedford School, one of England's oldest public schools, Murray was turned down by the British Army before signing up with the Foreign Legion. "I think perhaps I was just a young buck without much confidence in himself setting an extreme challenge to see if he could hack it in a man's world," he says in his book. He has since become the oldest man to walk unsupported to the South Pole, run a 240-km race in the Moroccan desert and climbed Mount Everest. Murray told Reuters after his appointment on Thursday that he expects to remain in Asia after he takes on the role. "This is a an international business and Asia is the future as China and India are driving demand for commodities," Murray told Reuters from a hotel in Tokyo, jazz music blaring in the background. "My first priority is to have a really good understanding of where Ivan wants to take the business." Murray is married with three children. His America-born wife Jennifer was the first woman to fly solo around the world in a helicopter.
