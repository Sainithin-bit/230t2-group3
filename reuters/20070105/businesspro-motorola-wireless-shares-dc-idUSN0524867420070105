 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of wireless technology 
companies fell on Friday as investors feared that a 
fourth-quarter warning from Motorola Inc. MOT.N, the No. 2 
handset maker, signaled weakness industrywide. 

  Motorola shares were down 9 percent on the New York Stock 
Exchange after the company said it would miss revenue and 
profit views. Motorola chip supplier RF Micro Devices Inc 
( RFMD.O ) and wireless chip maker Broadcom Corp ( BRCM.O ) were 
down nearly 4 percent.  Leading cell phone chip maker Texas Instruments Inc TXN.N 
fell more than 1 percent, and its rival Qualcomm Inc ( QCOM.O ) 
dropped nearly 2 percent. Handset leader Nokia 
( NOK.N )( NOK1V.HE ) saw its U.S. stock fall 5 percent.  Late on Thursday, Motorola cut its quarterly sales estimate 
to a range of $11.6 billion to $11.8 billion from its prior 
forecast of $11.8 billion to $12.1 billion.  But the company's estimate for 66 million phone sales in 
the quarter was above Wall Street expectations, implying that 
discounts were mostly to blame for the shortfall, according to 
analysts who viewed the warning as a omen of weakening profits 
for the entire industry.  "Product cycles are shortening while consumer fickleness is 
increasing, implying that overall industry operating margins 
are not likely to improve anytime soon," said RBC Capital 
Markets analyst Mark Sue.  Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Walkley slashed his estimate 
for Motorola's fourth-quarter operating margins to a range of 4 
percent to 5 percent from 11 percent as after the warning.  "We believe it may take several quarters for Motorola to 
correct the sudden decline in its handset operating margins," 
said Walkley.  Motorola shares were down $1.85 at $18.70 in morning trade, 
while Nokia's U.S. stock had fallen $1 at $19.92. Texas 
Instruments shares were down 42 cents, or 1.4 percent, at 
$28.68.
