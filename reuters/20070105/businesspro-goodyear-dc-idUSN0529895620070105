 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. GT.N said 
on Friday it expects to complete the closing of its tire plant 
in Tyler, Texas, in the first quarter of 2008 under plans to 
reduce private-label tire business in North America. 

  Goodyear, the largest U.S. tire maker, agreed to keep the 
plant open through 2007 under a new contract with the United 
Steelworkers union that members ratified in December to end a 
nearly three-month long strike. The plant has 1,100 workers.  The tire maker expects charges of $155 million to $160 
million to close the plant including pension and retiree 
medical costs, accelerated depreciation, asset write-offs and 
severance, Goodyear said in a federal regulatory filing.  Goodyear recorded a $107 million charge in the third 
quarter after announcing plans to close the Tyler plant in 
early 2007. It expects $10 million of charges in the fourth 
quarter and the balance in 2007 and 2008.
