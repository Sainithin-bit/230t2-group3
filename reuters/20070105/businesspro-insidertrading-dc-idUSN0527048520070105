 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A former Merrill Lynch & Co. Inc. 
MER.N analyst who pleaded guilty to giving tips to the 
accused masterminds of a far-reaching insider trading ring was 
sentenced on Friday to three years in prison. 

  Stanislav Shpigelman, 24, was the "critical component" of 
one scheme because his tips helped generate $6.7 million in 
illegal gains for the ring, said U.S. District Judge Kenneth 
Karas.  "Without a tipper, the tippees cannot profit a dime," Karas 
said. "Without his information, there would have been no 
insider trading."  Prosecutors said Shpigelman, who worked as a mergers and 
acquisition analyst at Merrill, gave tips to two former Goldman 
Sachs Group Inc. ( GS.N ) employees, Eugene Plotkin and David 
Pajcin.  Plotkin and Pajcin who are accused of leading an 
insider-trading ring that traded off Shpigelman's tips and also 
off stolen advance copies of BusinessWeek magazine that they 
got from a Milwaukee printing plant worker.  Shpigelman pleaded guilty to one count of insider trading, 
which carried a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.  His lawyer, Mary Mulligan, asked for a sentence of less 
than three years. Shpigelman's reaped illegal profits of only 
$12,000 and had no knowledge that others would profit millions 
when he leaked the information, Mulligan said.  But Assistant U.S. Attorney Ben Lawsky said Shpigelman went 
out partying to clubs in New York with Plotkin and Pajcin on 
the nights that their insider trades went through.  "Mr. Shpigelman did this for the oldest reason in the book 
-- greed," Lawsky said. "He provided them the most valuable 
information there is on Wall Street."  Pajcin has agreed to cooperate with authorities, while 
Plotkin and another defendant are awaiting trial in April on 
insider-trading and other charges.
