 CHICAGO  Jan 5 (Reuters) - Rural hospital operator
LifePoint Hospitals Inc. ( LPNT.O ) on Friday forecast 2007
earnings below Wall Street estimates, as margins are squeezed
by rising levels of unpaid medical bills, pushing its shares
down about 2 percent.  The company expects earnings of $2.42 to $2.52 per share,
compared with analysts' average forecast of $2.63 as compiled
by Reuters Estimates.  Profit margins at publicly-traded hospital chains have been
contracting in recent years, in large part on increasing levels
of unpaid medical bills, also known as bad debt. Rising numbers
of Americans without health insurance -- now at 46.6 million
people -- and higher co-payments for patients with insurance
are cited as culprits.  The results "should come as little surprise given the
challenging sector fundamentals, including rising bad debts and
weak (patient) volume growth," Goldman Sachs analyst
Christopher McFadden wrote in an investor note.  LifePoint forecast bad debt at 11.3 percent to 12.3 percent
of revenue in 2007, up from 2006 and worse than Wall Street
expectations.  On a conference call with investors, the company said bad
debt in the fourth quarter of 2006 looks stable, but that
December patient traffic had been disappointing.  Officials also expect some acquisition activity in the
second half of 2007. It forecast "a few" acquisitions each
year, of roughly the size of its larger facilities, for the
foreseeable future.  The company, which runs 51 hospitals in 19 states, forecast
2007 revenue of $2.68 billion to $2.69 billion, roughly in line
with analysts' forecasts.  Brentwood, Tennessee-based LifePoint said it would earn 61
cents to 64 cents per share in the first quarter. Analysts
polled by Reuters Estimates forecast, on average, 67 cents.  LifePoint shares were down 58 cents, or 1.7 percent, at
$32.97 on Nasdaq. The shares fell 10 percent in 2006, compared
with little change in the Morgan Stanley Healthcare Provider
Index.
