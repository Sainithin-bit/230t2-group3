 LONDON  (Reuters) - Wall Street stocks were set for a muted start on Friday, with oil producers expected to remain under pressure as crude traded below $55.50 a barrel and investors waited for monthly U.S. jobs data. 

 By 1126 GMT, U.S. stock futures were pointing to opening down 0.3 percent for the three main indexes SPc1 DJc1 NDc1. "There's a potential for a pull-back, but with the caveat that there's a lot of attractive valuations out there based on cash flows, and we still have the tailwind of equity and LBO interest out there," said Simon Clinch, director of U.S. equities at F&C Asset Management. "I'm upbeat for the year, I think in the near-term it could be quite messy." The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  gained 0.1 percent on Thursday to end at 12,480.69. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  added 0.1 percent while the Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  climbed 1.25 percent. Investors were waiting to scrutinize the details of the Labor Department's monthly U.S. nonfarm payroll data for December at 1330 GMT for an indication of the state of the world's biggest economy. Economists polled by Reuters expected modest job growth for December, with a gain of about 100,000 jobs, down from 132,000 in November. CRUDE DROPS Crude oil traded around $55.40 a barrel after falling by nearly nine percent in the past two days to its lowest level in 18 months on mild weather and rising U.S. fuel inventories. No S&P500 companies were scheduled to report earnings. Corporate news was thin, with Archstone-Smith ( ASN.N ) saying its Chief Financial Officer Charles E. Mueller would replace J. Lindsay Freeman, who is to retire at the end of 2007, as chief operating officer. Magazine publisher Time Inc., a unit of Time Warner Inc. ( TWX.N ), may decide in the next two weeks to cut 150 jobs, and Time magazine could be particularly hard hit, the New York Post reported on Friday, citing sources.
