 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - No. 5 U.S. carrier Northwest Airlines NWACQ.PK on Friday said it reached a deal to buy bankrupt regional carrier Mesaba Airlines, a move analysts say could save the struggling feeder airline. 

 Northwest, also in bankruptcy, said it reached the deal with Mesaba and its unsecured creditors committee. Any takeover, however, requires approval from Northwest and Mesaba's bankruptcy courts. Mair Holdings MAIR.O, Mesaba's parent, has not said whether it supports the proposal. One analyst said he does not think Mesaba can exit bankruptcy without a buyout. "Mesaba was an airline in serious trouble. Northwest had to do it to bail them out," said Terry Trippler, airline expert at myvacationpassport.com. "To me this seems like totally a white knight," he said. Mesaba, which has been in bankruptcy since October 2005, serves 88 cities in the United States and Canada from Detroit, Minneapolis and Memphis, Tennessee. On Thursday, Mesaba's unsecured creditors committee asked for court permission to terminate the exclusivity period during which only Mesaba may file a reorganization plan. If the court approves the request, it would pave the way for Northwest to co-sponsor a reorganization plan. If Northwest buys Mesaba, $145 million will go to Mesaba's bankruptcy estate, of which MAIR is a creditor. Other terms of the pact were not disclosed. "Northwest believes that having Mesaba as part of the Northwest family is the preferred way to operate the Northwest Airlines Saab 340 fleet," Northwest said. In an e-mail disclosure designed to answer questions about the proposed deal, Northwest said "there are no significant open issues requiring further negotiation." A Mesaba spokeswoman said the carrier was pleased with discussions so far, but she declined to offer more details of the plan. Spokesmen for Mair were not immediately available for comment. "I think they probably could block it, but I don't know why they would want to," Trippler said. Northwest filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors in September 2005. That bankruptcy, in turn, weighed on Mesaba.
