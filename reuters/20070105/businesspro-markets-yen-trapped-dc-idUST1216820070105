 TOKYO  (Reuters) - It's been at least 33 years since the yen 
has had such a steady year against the dollar. Both currencies 
are out of favor, for different reasons, and the net result was 
a tight, 11-yen range for all of 2006. 

  The big question is which of three possibilities will 
prevail: a big yen fall, a sharp recovery or another year of 
stability.  For now the bets are on the last of the three.  "The dollar has been weak due to the U.S. current account 
deficit while the yen has been weak due to low interest rates. 
They are both weak currencies," said Tohru Sasaki, chief 
foreign exchange strategist for JPMorgan Chase in Tokyo.  "I don't think the situation will change," Sasaki said, 
adding that he expects the dollar to trade between 112 yen to 
125 yen in 2007.  The dollar finished the year 0.9 percent higher against the 
yen than when it started -- currencies frequently move that 
much in a day.  During 2006, the pair stayed between just below 109 yen and 
nearly 120, the tightest annual range since Japan floated the 
yen in 1973. The dollar stood at 118.40 yen  JPY=  in Tokyo 
trading on Friday.  The range pales in comparison to the 30-, 50- or even 
60-yen annual swings seen in the 1980s and 1990s.  The winners, if the pair stays on an even keel, would be 
sellers of dollar/yen puts and calls. Option sellers make money 
on the premiums for the insurance-like contracts they sell. As 
long as the currencies don't stray too far, they profit.
  ARGUMENTS AGAINST BOTH UNITS  Although Japan extended an economic recovery last year and 
ended an era of ultra-easy monetary policy, yen deposits still 
offer far less than other currencies.  Japan raised interest rates to 0.25 percent from virtually 
zero in 2006 and many speculate another rate rise is imminent.  But even another Japanese interest rate rise or two won't 
alter the overall picture whereby other currencies offer far 
juicier yields, although in theory it would give the yen some 
fresh appeal.  Japanese household investors continue to hunger for 
higher-yielding foreign currencies. They have also been active 
in margin trading, which lets investors trade round-the-clock 
using the Internet and to place leveraged bets on currencies in 
a manner similar to hedge funds.  The dollar, meanwhile, is being hurt by concerns about a 
slowdown in the U.S. economy and a gaping U.S. current account 
deficit. The International Monetary Fund estimates the U.S. 
current account deficit will expand to $959 billion in 2007 
from $869 billion in 2006.  A dollar index measuring the U.S. currency against a basket 
of major currencies .DXY fell around eight percent in 2006.  The yen also fell broadly, sinking to record lows against 
the euro, eight-year lows against sterling and 14-year lows 
against the Canadian dollar.  Overseas demand for yen has been offset by the yen selling 
of yield-hungry Japanese investors.  "The two sides canceled each other out," said Masafumi 
Yamamoto, currency strategist for Nikko Citigroup in Tokyo, 
adding that dollar/yen was likely to remain stuck in a 
relatively cozy 15-yen range in 2007 and trade between 105 yen 
to 120 yen.  One risk scenario would be if such Japanese investment 
abroad reverses, due to a drastic narrowing of interest rate 
differentials or if a severe downturn in the Japanese economy 
or share prices causes retail investors to shy away from risk.  But with the benchmark Nikkei share average having risen to 
an eight-month closing high on Thursday, and with the BOJ 
expected to stick to a gradual pace of raising interest rates, 
such risks seem limited at this point, analysts say.  While traders see the possibility of the Bank of Japan 
raising interest rates to 0.75 percent by the end of 2007, few 
expect Japan's key overnight call rate to rise to 1.0 percent 
in 2007.  By way of comparison, according to the median forecast in a 
Reuters poll of economists in December, the Federal Reserve was 
expected to cut interest rates to 4.75 percent by end-2007 from 
5.25 percent now.
