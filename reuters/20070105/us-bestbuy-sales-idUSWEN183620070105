 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Best Buy Co. Inc. ( BBY.N ) and Circuit City Stores Inc. CC.N posted higher December sales on Friday as discounts drove demand for flat panel TVS and laptop computers during the holidays, and the two top U.S. consumer electronics chains raised their outlooks. 

 "It was clearly a good result in that the consumer electronics category and the TV categories were really the stars of what was otherwise not a fantastic Christmas season," said Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Colin McGranahan. Best Buy said its December same-store sales rose 7 percent, while smaller rival Circuit City said its December sales at stores open at least a year rose 4.2 percent. Shares of the two retailers have been under pressure since December, when they said steep drops in prices for flat-panel TVs hurt profit margins. Circuit City posted a surprise loss for its third-quarter that ended in November, while Best Buy's third-quarter earnings rose less than Wall Street expected. The December sales figures did not ease all worries about the competitive environment and pressure from falling prices, with Circuit City shares declining 1.5 percent in morning trading. "I think there were a lot more turnaround expectations at Circuit in terms of improved profit margins, and those aren't coming as quickly as people thought," said Tim Allen, an analyst with Jefferies & Co. ELECTRONIC HOLIDAYS Electronics were brisk sellers this holiday as retailers heavily promoted TVs, digital cameras, laptop computers and MP3 players to draw shoppers into their stores. Flat-panel LCD and plasma TVs were one of the holiday season's hottest items as the falling prices spurred demand. In an effort to gain market share, retailers rolled out cut-throat promotions during the Thanksgiving weekend, which marks the start to the holiday shopping season, selling 42-inch plasma televisions for under $1,000. While Best Buy and Circuit City said the unexpectedly sharp decline in prices for advanced TVs pressured margins during November, they said margin pressure tends to ease in December, when the promotions retailers offer are not as extensive. Circuit City said its sales results were stronger than expected in the second half of December, prompting it to raise its sales outlook for fiscal 2007. It now expects consolidated net sales growth of 9 percent to 10 percent, up from 8 percent to 9 percent, and said it sees its fiscal year earnings at the "top end" of its previous forecast. Best Buy forecast earnings of $2.70 to $2.80 per share for its fiscal year ending in February, up from a previous view of $2.65 to $2.80. It said it was on track to post revenue gains near 16 percent in fiscal 2007, with about two months left in the year, and a same-store sales increase of about 5 percent. Best Buy said December's sales were particularly strong in flat-panel TVs, video gaming, MP3 players and laptop computers. It recorded high double-digit same-store sales advances in flat-panel TVs, and a double-digit same-store sales gain in MP3 players and accessories. Circuit City said that in its domestic business, which accounts for the majority of its business, TV same-store sales increased by double digits, with double-digit comparable store sales growth in flat panel TVs. Best Buy shares rose 2 percent to $50.93 while Circuit City shares declined 1.5 percent to $19.70. Best Buy trades at 15.7 times next year's projected earnings, while Circuit City trades at 22.2 times. (Additional reporting by  Brad Dorfman  in Chicago)
