 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks declined on Friday after stronger-than-expected December job growth dimmed hopes for a cut in interest rates and a disappointing forecast from Motorola Inc. MOT.N revived concerns about corporate profits. 

 The U.S. economy created a surprisingly strong 167,000 jobs in December and hourly wages showed the sharpest rise in eight months, the Labor Department said in a report that suggested the economy was still too strong to prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates.  "The employment report was the big news," said Neil Wolfson, president of Investment Management at Wilmington Trust in New York. "The economy is not weakening the way some people had forecast and therefore the Fed is unlikely to be cutting rates in the short term." The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was down 103.83 points, or 0.83 percent, at 12,376.86. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was down 10.96 points, or 0.77 percent, at 1,407.38. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was down 25.38 points, or 1.03 percent, at 2,428.05. Shares of Motorola, the world's second largest cell phone maker, fell 8.3 percent to $18.84 and were on track to record their biggest one-day percentage drop in two years. Motorola cut its sales and earnings outlook for the recently ended fourth quarter significantly below Wall Street's estimates, sparking concern about profitability for the sector.  Several brokerages cut their ratings on the stock. One of the biggest drags on Nasdaq was wireless chip maker Broadcom Corp. ( BRCM.O ). Credit Suisse cut its rating and price target on Broadcom, saying it expects a temporary product cycle lull in 2007. Shares fell 4.2 percent to $32.14. Shares of interest-rate sensitive financial stocks also fell, with Bank of America ( BAC.N ) down 1 percent at $53.11 and Citigroup Inc. ( C.N ) off 0.7 percent at $54.65. In the afternoon, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke spoke to business groups in Chicago but did not comment on the current economy or future monetary policy.
