 TORONTO  (Reuters) - Power Financial Corp. ( PWF.TO ) said on 
Thursday that it was in discussions on the potential 
acquisition of U.S. money manager Putnam Investments, but it 
said no agreement had been reached. 

  The Wall Street Journal and other media outlets have 
reported that Power Financial, a unit of holding company Power 
Corp. of Canada ( POW.TO ), has agreed to buy Boston-based Putnam 
from its parent, financial services company Marsh & McLennan 
Cos. Inc. ( MMC.N ), for $3.9 billion.  Power Financial spokesman Edward Johnson said he would not 
provide more detail than was contained in a brief company 
statement, which said that due to "media speculation" and 
discussions with the Toronto Stock Exchange, it was confirming 
its participation in the Putnam sales process started by Marsh 
& McLennan in the fall.  But Power Financial added that "at this time, no agreement 
has been reached by the participants in the process."  Reuters reported earlier this week that a deal for Putnam 
was not expected to be announced immediately, as final details 
needed to be ironed out.  Montreal-based Power Financial controls insurer Great-West 
Lifeco Inc. ( GWO.TO ) and IGM Financial Inc. ( IGM.TO ), Canada's 
largest mutual fund company with more than C$106 billion in 
assets under management. Putnam has $191 billion in assets 
under management, and its employees own about 15 percent of the 
firm.  Observers have said Power Financial would gain a key 
foothold in the U.S. money-management business by acquiring 
Putnam, which has struggled with mutual fund net redemptions 
after being caught up in an industry trading scandal three 
years ago.  ($1=$1.18 Canadian)
