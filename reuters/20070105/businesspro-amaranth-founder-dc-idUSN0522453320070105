 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The founder of Amaranth Advisors, the 
hedge fund that lost $6.4 billion in a few days last year, is 
trying to start a new business, The Wall Street Journal 
reported on Friday, citing people close to the matter. 

  Amaranth's chief executive, Nick Maounis, is considering 
starting a firm with some of his former colleagues, the Journal 
said. It would either manage money for investors directly, or 
help other funds run their businesses, the Journal said.  Two of the possible names are "Continuum" and "Segue," the 
paper said, citing sources.  Maounis' primary focus is "winding up Amaranth," but he is 
looking forward to focusing on other things, said one of his 
attorneys, David Boies.  Amaranth said in October it would lay off about half its 
staff to cut operating expenses as it liquidates its portfolio 
in the wake of the worst hedge fund loss ever.  Amaranth suffered the loss on wrong-way bets in the energy 
markets in September, cutting its assets by up to 70 percent 
and forcing it to liquidate its portfolio to pay investors.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Commodity 
Futures Trading Commission and Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission have been conducting interviews with Amaranth 
personnel and other parties on Wall Street, the Journal 
reported, citing sources.  Boies and Maounis were not immediately available for 
comment. Officials at a group representing Amaranth also were 
not immediately available for comment.
