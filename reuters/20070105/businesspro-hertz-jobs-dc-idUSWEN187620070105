 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Hertz Global Holdings Inc. 
( HTZ.N ) on Friday cut some 200 jobs in the United States in a 
move the car rental company expects will save up to $15.8 
million annually. 

  The company said it expects to record a restructuring 
charge of $3.3 million to $3.8 million for the first quarter of 
2007 as a result. Hertz said the cuts are at its corporate 
headquarters in Park Ridge, New Jersey, its U.S. service center 
in Oklahoma City and in its U.S. field operations.  The company, bought by private equity funds from Ford Motor 
Co. ( F.N ) in December 2005 and then taken public last November, 
said the cuts were the first part of a longer term cost-cutting 
bid.
