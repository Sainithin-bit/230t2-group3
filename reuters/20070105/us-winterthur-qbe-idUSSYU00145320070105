 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Australia's QBE Insurance Group Ltd. ( QBE.AX ) said on Friday it would buy Winterthur US Holdings from France's AXA ( AXAF.PA ) for US$1.2 billion, making its biggest ever acquisition to boost its U.S. presence. 

 Investors cheered QBE's second major U.S. buy in two months, lifting its shares 7 percent to a record A$30.40. By 0357 GMT, QBE shares had given up some gains but were still up 5.1 percent at A$29.84 in a lower overall market. "If you combine this with the Praetorian acquisition that they did in December, their footprint in the U.S. is now quite large. These are two very sizeable acquisitions," said Credit Suisse analyst Arjan van Veen. Wisconsin-based Winterthur US writes property and casualty insurance risks through 1,700 independent agents in 33 states of the United States. Gross premium income for 2007 is expected to be around US$1.45 billion and QBE forecasts the deal to add a net profit after tax of about US$160 million in the first full year. AXA, which bought Swiss insurer Winterthur in June last year, said in a statement that Winterthur US would repay US$636 million of inter-company loans to the Winterthur Group. QBE would raise about A$800 million ($630 million) in a share placement to fund part of the purchase. It will also use existing excess capital and short-term debt to fund the purchase, and its acquisition of Praetorian Financial. QBE last month announced purchase of Praetorian for US$800 million from German reinsurer Hannover Re ( HNRGn.DE ). Australian insurers are looking to spread overseas as they battle stagnant growth in the home market. Last year, Insurance Australia Group Ltd. ( IAG.AX ) made two purchases in the UK. Global rating agency Standard & Poor's kept its ratings on QBE unchanged after the latest acquisition. The planned acquisition would enhance QBE's business profile in the U.S., boosting its scale of operations and geographical reach, as well as giving it a sound distribution platform, S&P said in a statement. The acquisition was supportive of QBE's U.S. growth strategy S&P's credit analyst Derryl D'silva said. With the latest purchase, QBE would earn more than 80 percent of its premiums overseas. It has grown largely by buying small-to-medium general insurers, with annual gross written premiums of up to around A$500 million, and has concluded more than 90 buys since 1982 and operates in over 40 countries. Frank O'Halloran, QBE's chief executive, said the company would be disciplined as it pursues overseas growth. "We are obviously delighted with the prices that we have paid for these acquisitions," he said. "In some areas competition is raising prices, but as far as QBE is concerned we have our acquisition criteria and we will not go against that," O'Halloran added. HUNGRY FOR GROWTH QBE will now develop its Latin American business and pursue acquisitions opportunities in Eastern Europe and Asia, he said. "We are not looking for large acquisitions in Latin America, we are looking at acquisitions that are very much bolt on. So that may give us a footprint," he added. "And we are keeping our ears to the ground in Australia." Following the acquisition, QBE's debt-to-equity ratio will remain at around 40 percent, the company said. The acquisitions are expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2007. Annualized gross premium income from QBE's American operations is expected to be around US$4.6 billion, slightly less than 40 percent of QBE Group gross premium income. QBE expects to extract synergies of about A$25 million after tax by the end of 2008. "This is another typical QBE acquisition, multiple-wise, it's 1.5 times NTA (net tangible assets) and obviously QBE is trading on a significantly higher multiple than that," Arjan van Veen said. "PE-wise again, it's a significant discount toward what QBE is trading at, especially if you put in the synergies," he added. QBE trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of about 15 based on December 2007 expected profits, according to Reuters Estimates, compared with 14.7 for rival IAG. The benefits from QBE's latest acquisition will accrue in 2008. (Additional reporting by Ian Chua)
