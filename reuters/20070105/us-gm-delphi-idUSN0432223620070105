 DETROIT  (Reuters) - A deal between General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) and Delphi Corp. DPHIQ.PK could be delayed by a rival reorganization offer for the bankrupt supplier, although the most important issues have been outlined in negotiations between the two companies and their major union, GM's chief executive said on Thursday. 

 GM, which spun off Delphi in 1999, has been in negotiations with Delphi and its major union to allow the supplier to emerge from bankruptcy with lower costs. GM has made resolving its remaining labor-related issues with Delphi a top priority to avoid a potential strike that would shut down its North American operations. "The broadest, the most important issues have been defined, but there is more stuff to be done," Rick Wagoner told reporters in an interview. "A lot of the work going forward from today is engagement from the unions and working on the specific sites that will stay in business or won't. There are some that are up for sale -- who is going to be the buyer, how those negotiations are going to go, what is GM going to buy from those new companies -- those kinds of things." GM has said it expected its total exposure to Delphi's bankruptcy to be $6 billion to $7.5 billion. The bankruptcy court later this month will hear arguments against Delphi's proposed $3.4 billion bankruptcy-emergence deal with a group of investors led by Appaloosa Management LP and Cerberus Capital Management. The hearing was postponed following an alternative funding plan proposed in December by hedge fund Highland Capital Management LP. Dallas-based Highland proposed a $4.7 billion reorganization plan for Delphi, setting the stage for a fight for control of the auto parts supplier between its two largest investors as Delphi emerges from bankruptcy. Under the Cerberus deal, GM would receive 7 million shares of common stock in the reorganized Delphi, $2.63 billion in cash and an unconditional release of alleged Delphi claims against GM. The initial Delphi plan was seen as a prod to a faster deal between GM, Delphi and the United Auto Workers Union since the plan set a January 31 deadline for reaching a three-way agreement as a condition for the offer. Wagoner said a Delphi board decision to consider the Highland option would slow down the process. "The transaction is structured as it is (and) was a result of a lot of work with a lot of people," Wagoner said. "There are a lot of moving parts, so if someone comes and changes this piece, many other pieces could or would change." "Undoubtedly, if the Delphi board were to say 'we would rather consider this option,' it would slow things down." Delphi filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. automotive history in October 2005, aiming to slash wages and benefits and close some operations to reorganize its money-losing domestic unit. International operations were excluded from the filing.
