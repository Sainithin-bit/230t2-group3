 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Wendy's International Inc. WEN.N said 
on Friday sales at company-owned restaurants open at least 15 
months rose 3.1 percent in the fourth quarter, helped by demand 
for the chain's new Double Melt cheeseburgers. 

  At franchised Wendy's restaurants, same-store sales rose 
2.7 percent.  The company also posted a 6.1 percent same-store sales 
increase at company owned restaurants in December, the best 
month in 2-1/2 years for Wendy's, which is battling with larger 
rivals McDonald's Corp. ( MCD.N ) and Burger King Holdings Inc. 
BKC.N in the U.S. burger market.  Wendy's has relied on promotions of items like a 99-cent 
junior bacon cheeseburger and new products like the Double Melt 
cheeseburger to help lift sales, which have improved in the 
past three quarters after a same-store sales drop of 4.8 
percent in the first quarter.  "We expect to see similar quarterly sales results in the 
coming year and anticipate a strong start in 2007," Kerrii 
Anderson, chief executive officer, said in a news release.  Wendy's has already said beef costs were about 4 percent 
lower in the 2006 fourth quarter, compared with the 
year-earlier quarter and that it also expects to realize $5 
million to $6 million in additional interest income in the 
period.  But the company also expects higher expense for 
performance-based compensation in the quarter, $4 million in 
pretax expenses for its test of a breakfast menu and $4 million 
to $8 million in pretax charges for restaurant closures.
