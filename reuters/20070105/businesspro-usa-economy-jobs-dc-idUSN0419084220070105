 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. economy added a 
surprisingly strong 167,000 jobs in December, according to a 
government report on Friday that also showed more robust hiring 
in each of the two prior months than previously estimated. 

  The Labor Department said the unemployment rate was 
unchanged from November at 4.5 percent. Wall Street economists 
had forecast that only 100,000 new jobs would be created in 
December, so the monthly report painted a picture of a 
substantially healthier job market than anticipated as 2006 
ended.  All the new hiring since September has been in service 
industries while goods producers have cut jobs in each of the 
four months. In December, there were 178,000 more jobs added in 
service businesses while goods producers shed 11,000.  The department revised up November hiring to show 154,000 
new jobs instead of 132,000 that it reported a month ago and it 
said there were 86,000 new jobs in October instead of 79,000.  Some parts of the report may be troubling to Federal 
Reserve policy-makers who have expressed concern about 
potential inflation. Average hourly earnings climbed 0.5 
percent in December - the largest monthly increase since a 0.6 
percent jump in April -- after a 0.3 percent gain in November.  The average workweek was unchanged at 33.9 hours but 
overtime ticked up to an average 4.3 hours last month from 4.2 
in November.  Construction industries dropped 3,000 jobs in December, a 
fourth straight month in which jobs were cut in a weakened 
housing sector. Some 12,000 manufacturing jobs were lost last 
month, a sixth straight month of factory job declines.
