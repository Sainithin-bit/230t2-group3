 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Home Depot Inc.'s ( HD.N ) new chairman and chief executive, Frank Blake, has a ton of repair work to do for shareholders, workers and consumers, experts said this week. 

 While the exit of former CEO Robert Nardelli after six years removes a target of criticism, the world's largest home improvement retailer is far from out of the woods, as activist investors push for change while takeover talk persists. In addition to improving relations with angry shareholders, Blake will have to shore up Home Depot's stores to fend off rival Lowe's Cos. ( LOW.N ), and show that the lower-margin supply business and a move into China can deliver meaningful returns. "This used to be a growth stock and now it's a value stock," said Bill Schultz, chief investment officer at McQueen, Ball & Associates, which owns Home Depot shares. "If they cannot reinvigorate their growth rates, you'll continue to see it trade at ... low P/E levels." Perhaps the biggest task is restoring management credibility in such a way that Wall Street, investors, workers and customers will see a change, said James Senn, director of Georgia State University's Center for Global Business Leadership. Years ago, Atlanta-based Home Depot was a place where people came to work to build a great company and help customers, Senn said. "One of the concerns is 'has the spirit that was Home Depot been lost or is still there and just needs to be unlocked?'" Senn said. Friends of Blake described him as a brilliant yet down-to-earth consensus builder, and ex-Home Depot staffers said he was a pleasure to work with. Blake, a former General Electric Co. executive, came to Home Depot in 2002 and has been responsible for business strategy. "Frank is a fantastic strategic thinker and a very good people person," said Tom Adams, senior adviser with the Department of Energy. He said Blake lifted morale when the two worked at the Environmental Protection Agency. "He's one of the most capable people I've met in my life, but he has a very comfortable kind of unassuming presence," said Jim Barnes, a professor at Indiana University who also worked with Blake at the EPA. At the stores, which account for 85 percent of Home Depot's total revenue, employee morale has suffered and investments have not had enough impact on sales, said Joseph Feldman, managing director at independent research firm Telsey Advisory Group. "A big factor is just to improve the image of the company, to start getting a little more positive buzz that employees are re-energized or are excited to be there," Feldman said. Home Depot shares were down 51 cents to $40.06 in morning trading on Friday. The stock is down 21 percent over the past five years, compared with a 42 percent rise for Lowe's.
