 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Tool maker Black & Decker Corp BDK.N reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings on Thursday as sales growth helped offset higher commodity prices, sending its shares up about 6 percent. 

 The stock bounce reflected investor relief that the maker of DeWalt drills and Kwikset locks was finding its way through a sharp slowdown in U.S. construction activity, the result of the two-year slump in the housing market. "It doesn't look like things are going to get a lot worse for these guys," said David MacGregor, analyst at Longbow Research in Cleveland, Ohio. "It seems like they're managing their way through this downturn pretty nicely." The results came a day after fellow toolmaker Stanley Works ( SWK.N ) saw its shares rise on flat earnings but a higher fourth-quarter outlook. "Solid growth in many of our businesses, combined with favorable currency, enabled Black & Decker to increase sales despite weak markets in North America," Chairman and Chief Executive Nolan Archibald said in a statement. "We do not expect near-term improvement in the U.S. housing industry or a particularly robust holiday season." A survey released on Thursday forecast that U.S. construction spending would decline further next year but at a more moderate pace. The McGraw-Hill 2008 Construction Outlook predicted a 2 percent decline in construction starts next year, compared with this year's expected 8 percent decline. TOPS WALL STREET VIEW Towson, Maryland-based Black & Decker said net income was $104.6 million, or $1.59 a share, down 16.4 percent from $125.1 million, or $1.74 a share, a year earlier. The results were sharply higher than the $1.44 per share analysts, on average, had expected, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 1.5 percent to $1.63 billion. It said it expects fourth-quarter profit of $1.55 to $1.65 per share. Analysts, on average, expect $1.60 per share. Black & Decker shares were up $4.69, or 5.7 percent, to $87.69 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Black & Decker shares are up about 10 percent on the year while Stanley's are up about 16 percent. By way of comparison, the broad Standard & Poor's 500 index  .SPX  is up about 7 percent.
