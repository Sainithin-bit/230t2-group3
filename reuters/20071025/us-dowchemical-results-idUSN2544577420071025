 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Dow Chemical Co ( DOW.N ) on Thursday reported lower-than-expected third-quarter profit, hurt by weak North American housing and auto markets and a change to German tax law. 

 Net income fell 21 percent to $403 million, or 42 cents a share, from $512 million, or 53 cents a share, a year earlier. The latest results included charges of 38 cents a share from the tax law change and 4 cents for the acquisition of research and development assets. Excluding special items in both periods, the largest U.S. chemical maker posted quarterly earnings of 84 cents a share, down from 98 cents a year earlier and below the analysts' average estimate of 91 cents. HSBC analyst Hassan Ahmed said the big disappointment was in performance chemicals, where earnings before interest and taxes fell sharply. The unit, which makes intermediates and emulsion polymers used in paints and coatings, has suffered because of a slowdown in the North American housing and auto industries. Last week the National Association of Home Builders said U.S. home builder sentiment in October sank to a record low. Simultaneously, U.S. automakers are grappling with a loss in domestic market share to Japanese rivals. Quarterly sales rose 10 percent to $13.59 billion, ahead of Wall Street's forecast of $12.65 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Midland, Michigan-based Dow is focused on increasing its more profitable specialty businesses, while expanding its commodity chemicals operations through a lower-cost joint venture strategy. In a recent note to clients, JPMorgan analyst Jeffrey Zekauskas said he expected Dow to have a ragged third quarter, noting the period probably began strongly and then weakened. "Price increases in polyethylene in July widened basic plastic margins," he said. "But the sharp appreciation in oil prices to more than $80 per barrel in September from $69 in August probably eroded profitability through the quarter." In a statement, Dow Chief Executive Andrew Liveris said there was particularly strong demand in emerging markets in Eastern Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America, but noted that volatile feedstock and energy costs were a concern. "Global economic conditions remain reasonably healthy, even though there may be some concerns about the resilience of the U.S. economy going forward," Liveris said. Dow shares were down 18 cents at $43.80 in morning New York Stock Exchange trade. At Wednesday's close, the stock had fallen about 1.5 percent in the last six months, while the Standard & Poor's Chemicals Index .GSPPM had risen about 13.5 percent. (Reporting by Euan Rocha)
