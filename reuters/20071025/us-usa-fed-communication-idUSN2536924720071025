 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve is close to agreeing changes in its communication strategy, including quarterly publication of internal forecasts, but it will not adopt an inflation target any time soon, Fed sources said on Friday. 

 The sources broadly confirmed a Wall Street Journal report that said the steps could be reviewed when the central bank holds a two-day policy-setting meeting next week, and include extending the horizon of its published forecasts to three-year periods compared with the current two-year outlook, as a compromise proxy for an inflation target. The Fed currently publishes its forecasts twice a year for economic growth, core inflation and the unemployment rate. Given recent credit market turmoil and the high degree of uncertainty shrouding the economic outlook, the hoped-for discussion could be postponed. The Federal Open Market Committee, which cut borrowing costs by a half-percentage point last month, is expected to lower rates again next week. Fed watchers said extending the horizon for Fed forecasts on economic growth, core inflation and the unemployment rate, which are currently delivered twice a year as part of the central bank's regular reports to Congress, would be a elegant trade-off between proponents of inflation targeting, such as Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, and others who are more skeptical. "We are moving toward best practice in the central banking world. This looks like a great compromise," said Brandeis University professor Stephen Cecchetti, a former research director at the New York Federal Reserve Bank. LOOKING AHEAD The Fed launched a formal review of its communications strategy in the spring of last year when Bernanke appointed Fed Vice Chairman Donald Kohn, a targeting skeptic, to lead a subcommittee to frame discussions. Those discussions have covered a range of issues, including the desirability of adopting a numeric inflation goal. The Fed is mandated by Congress to pursue both maximum growth and price stability, but it has no explicit operating definition of what constitutes stable prices. Kohn confessed to being "relatively more persuaded that inflation targeting helps reduce the variance of inflation expectations" in a speech late last month, but he said he had yet to be convinced targeting was a step the Fed should take. St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President William Poole discussed the option of publishing Fed forecasts more frequently at a conference last week. "You might ask if it would be more useful to release (them) on a quarterly basis, or a monthly basis, or every FOMC meeting, and you might come to a judgment that some interval more often than semi-annual might be worthwhile," he said. Providing a three-year forecast would offer insight into where officials expect output and inflation to move and suggest where they would like these variables to be. "You cannot always bring inflation back within two years to where your objective is. But I do believe (a three-year forecast) will serve a very useful purpose in helping us to understand what they believe to be the neutral, long-run, steady state" of the economy, said Cecchetti. STICKING POINTS Fed insiders said there were complex issues involved in the discussions that may not yet be settled. For instance, a forecast of output and inflation also implies certain assumptions about future Fed interest-rate decisions, and there are different views on where to derive these inputs. The Fed says its semi-annual forecasts are "conditioned on the assumption of appropriate monetary policy" without explaining what that means or the source of the assumptions. Some central banks use market-based forward rates, but that creates a problem if policy-makers disagree with the judgment of the market on the future path of monetary policy. Others doubted there would be enough time to even think about taking such steps in the middle of the ongoing uncertainty sparked by a credit crunch stemming from problems in the U.S. sublime mortgage market. "I have to say that it would surprise me if it will get much attention at this meeting, owing to the likelihood that there will be sufficient divergence of views about current conditions," said Columbia University professor Michael Woodford.
