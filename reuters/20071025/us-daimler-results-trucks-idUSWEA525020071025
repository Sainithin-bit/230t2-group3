 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Germany's Daimler AG ( DAIGn.DE ), the world's biggest truckmaker, does not expect the truck market in the United States to rebound until early next year, Chief Financial Officer Bodo Uebber told a conference call on Thursday. 

 "We don't see upcoming orders in Q3 and Q4. We think the order intake and the growth in the U.S. will pick up earliest in the first quarter of 2008," he said.
