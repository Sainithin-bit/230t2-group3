 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - German carmaker Daimler AG ( DAIGn.DE ) is seeing scant impact from the U.S. credit crunch other than the usual rise in late payments that accompanies an economic slowdown, Chief Financial Officer Bodo Uebber said. 

 "We have a weaker U.S. economy," he told a conference call on third-quarter results on Thursday when asked about fallout from the U.S. subprime mortgage woes. "We have in some (U.S.) states some higher delinquencies and the impact of that was 50 million (euros) in reserves for the third quarter in 2007. That is not a subprime impact. That is the normal course of a weaker economy and not of huge concern. We are fine with our operations there," he added.
