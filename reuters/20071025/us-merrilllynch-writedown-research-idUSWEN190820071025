 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wall Street analysts caught flat-footed by Merrill Lynch & Co Inc's MER.N $8.4 billion write-down bared their fangs on Thursday, with some of them predicting another whopper hit to the company's mortgage-related holdings. 

 Goldman Sachs analyst William Tanona estimated Merrill Lynch could have a $4.5 billion write-down in the current quarter on its remaining $20.9 billion exposure to collateralized debt obligations and subprime mortgages. He said the market for those securities continues to deteriorate. Goldman also dropped Merrill from its Americas Buy list of recommended stocks, noting that Merrill shares dropped 24 percent since being added to the list in early April. The Standard & Poor's 500 index  .SPX  rose 6.4 percent in that time. Merrill shares fell further in early trade on Thursday, slipping 2.2 percent to $61.85 on the New York Stock Exchange the day after the company announced its unexpectedly large write-down, mostly from bad investments related to risky subprime mortgages. Merrill also reported a $2.3 billion loss, the biggest quarterly loss in its history. The stock is down 34 percent this year. Brad Hintz, a Bernstein Research analyst who once hailed Merrill Lynch's subprime risk as relatively limited compared to its rivals, downgraded the stock to "market perform" and posed the question, "What Risk Management?" in his latest research note. "Merrill's management team dodged and weaved around the questions coming from the investor community, all the while congratulating themselves for improving their disclosure after taking a massive loss," Hintz said, describing the company's conference call. "Was Merrill afraid that the rest of Wall Street would steal the firm's secrets of hedging CDO exposure and controlling risk? We don't think so," Hintz wrote. Hintz also said he fears more CDO and subprime-related write-downs at Merrill. In contrast, Citigroup analyst Prashant Bhatia said no other shoe is likely to drop, reiterating a "buy" rating. "Buying brokers during times of distress tends to be a great value proposition and we estimate that Merrill's current valuation creates one of those rare opportunities," Bhatia said. David Hendler, an analyst at independent fixed-income research firm CreditSights Inc., said Merrill could take another $1.7 billion hit to its remaining $5.7 billion exposure to subprime mortgages. In a telephone interview with Reuters on Wednesday, Merrill Lynch Chief Financial Officer Jeff Edwards said further write-downs cannot be ruled out. "We'll continue to see how market conditions develop," Edwards said. (Reporting by Tim McLaughlin, editing by Brian Moss)
