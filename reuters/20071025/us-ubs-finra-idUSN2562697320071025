 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - UBS AG ( UBSN.VX ) UBS Financial Services Inc has been censured and fined $370,000 in a settlement with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) for making what the self-regulatory group said were hundreds of late disclosures about its brokers. 

 The violations, which included delayed reports on customer complaints, regulatory actions and criminal disclosures, occurred over a three-year period, from January 2002 through December 2004, FINRA said in a statement Thursday. A spokeswoman for the Swiss bank said it was "pleased that this matter has been resolved." FINRA said the late disclosures may have hampered investors' ability to check the background of certain brokers and hindered the regulatory group from promptly investigating some disclosure items. As part of the settlement agreement, UBS, which neither admitted or denied the allegations, agreed to conduct an internal audit to evaluate its system for timely compliance with certain reporting forms.
