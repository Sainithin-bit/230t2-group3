 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Dow Chemical Co ( DOW.N ) on Thursday reported lower-than-expected third-quarter profit, hurt by a change in German tax law and a charge for acquisition costs. 

 Net income declined to $403 million, or 42 cents a share, from $512 million, or 53 cents a share, a year earlier, when Dow took charges to shut down several of its operations. The latest results included charges of 38 cents a share from the change in German tax laws and 4 cents for the acquisition of research and development assets. Excluding special items, the largest U.S. chemical maker posted quarterly earnings of 84 cents a share. Analysts on average were expecting 91 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Quarterly sales rose 10 percent to $13.59 billion, ahead of Wall Street's forecast of $12.65 billion. The Midland, Michigan-based company is focused on increasing its more profitable specialty businesses, while expanding its commodity chemicals operations through a lower-cost joint venture strategy. "Global economic conditions remain reasonably healthy, even though there may be some concerns about the resilience of the U.S. economy going forward," Chief Executive Andrew Liveris said in a statement. Liveris said there was particularly strong demand in emerging markets in Eastern Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America. However, he cited concerns about volatile feedstock and energy costs. Shares of Dow have fallen about 1.5 percent in the last six months, while the Standard & Poor's Chemicals Index .GSPPM has risen about 13.5 percent. (Reporting by  Euan Rocha )
