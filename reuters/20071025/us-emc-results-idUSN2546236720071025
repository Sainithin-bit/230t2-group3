 BOSTON  (Reuters) - EMC Corp ( EMC.N ), the top maker of corporate data storage equipment, reported a 74 percent rise in quarterly profit and doubled its stock buyback program to $2 billion, sending shares up 4 percent on Thursday. 

 The stock was also boosted by strong results on Wednesday from business software maker VMware Inc ( VMW.N ), of which EMC owns 86 percent. EMC Chief Executive Joe Tucci said he expected his company to meet its financial goals this year, despite questions about demand from its clients in the financial services industry. Tucci said on a conference call that EMC had seen a little year-on-year growth in its financial services business in the third quarter. "Momentum continues to build," said Brent Bracelin, an analyst with Pacific Crest Securities. "They had good momentum there in a tough quarter in their underlying core storage business. Now they are entering their strongest quarter of the year -- the fourth quarter." Like most technology companies, EMC tends to perform best in its final quarter of the year as its sales force hustles to meet year-end quotas, and companies spend money that is left over in annual budgets. Third-quarter net income rose to $492.9 million, or 23 cents a share, from $283.7 million, or 13 cents a share, a year earlier. Income was boosted by a $115.2 million gain from the sale of some VMware shares to Cisco Systems Inc. ( CSCO.O ) Excluding that gain, profit was 17 cents per share, in line with the average Wall Street forecast according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 17 percent to $3.3 billion, compared to analysts' expectation of $3.2 billion. Sales were fueled by growth in software products acquired over the past few years. EMC's highest-profile asset is VMware, which said on Wednesday that its third quarter profit had tripled, topping market expectations. The leading maker of virtualization software, which allows a single computer to operate like many machines, now has a stock market value of more than $40 billion after it initial public offering in August. VMware shares rose 4.12 percent to $107.65. EMC shares rose 4.04 percent to $23.44. EMC Chief Financial Officer David Goulden said in a statement that EMC had increased a previously announced stock buyback plan from $1 billion to $2 billion. He also reiterated EMC's target to earn more than 64 cents per share on revenue of more than $12.7 billion in the fourth quarter. In the third quarter, revenue from North America rose 15 percent from a year ago and represented 59 percent of total revenue. Revenue from outside North America rose 21 percent, EMC said.
