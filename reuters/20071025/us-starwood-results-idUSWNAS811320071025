 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc ( HOT.N ) on Thursday posted lower quarterly profit and forecast future earnings below expectations amid pressures on its timeshare business and shares fell nearly 4 percent. 

 Starwood's lower earnings are the latest sign of a slowdown in the booming lodging industry, which has enjoyed years of robust growth as strong demand and the limited construction of new hotels allowed hoteliers to steadily raise rates. But that growth, especially in the United States, is slowing. The company, which owns the Sheraton, Westin, W Hotels and other chains, reported third-quarter net income of $129 million, or 61 cents per share, compared with $155 million, or 71 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding a charge of 7 cents per share related to two hotels that the company expects to sell in the fourth quarter, Starwood earned 68 cents per share from continuing operations, ahead of Wall Street expectations of 66 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 5.4 percent to $1.54 billion as comparable worldwide revenue per available room, or revpar -- a key measure of hotel performance that reflects room rates and occupancy levels -- rose 9.5 percent. Starwood's international operations easily outperformed hotels in North America, which posted revpar growth of 6.1 percent compared to 15.9 percent growth in Latin America and 14.6 percent growth in Asia Pacific. The figures mark the first for new chief executive, Frits van Paasschen, who assumed the job on September 24. The former head of Coors Brewing Co was selected to replace Steven Heyer, who was forced out in April after losing the board's confidence. TIMESHARE PRESSURE Timeshare sales and profits were lower than expected in the third quarter due to limited inventory available in Hawaii, where a project was delayed, Starwood said. The company said the trend could continue into the fourth quarter and next year. As a result of the slowness, the company said 2007 earnings at its vacation ownership business are expected to be about $30 million lower than expected. Meanwhile, softness in the asset-backed securities market caused Starwood to delay a planned securitization of notes receivable from its timeshare business, it said. The company said the delayed securitization would burden fourth-quarter earnings by $25 million. Accounting for the pressures on its timeshare business, Starwood forecast earnings of 66 cents per share, below Wall Street analyst expectations of 85 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. The company forecast 2008 earnings in a range of $2.47 to $2.60 per share, below analyst expectations of $2.66, according to Reuters Estimates. Starwood forecast revpar to grow 6 percent to 8 percent at comparable hotels worldwide, compared to 2007 growth of 9 percent to 11 percent. Shares fell 3.6 percent in premarket trading to $55.50. Starwood shares have fallen about 24 percent since hitting a 10-year high of $75.45 on July 5.
