 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Peter Forlenza, global co-head of equities at Bank of America Corp( BAC.N ), is leaving the company, a spokeswoman said on Thursday. 

 The second-largest U.S. bank said on Wednesday it was eliminating 3,000 jobs in its corporate and investment banking unit, and replacing the unit's president. Forlenza is stepping down to spend more time with his family, and left voluntarily, the spokeswoman said. With Forlenza's departure, Ciaran O'Kelly is now sole head of equities. Cuts at Bank of America's commercial and investment banking unit follow a 93 percent decline in third quarter profit there. As part of the changes announced on Wednesday, Bank of America named Brian Moynihan, 48, as president of global corporate and investment banking, replacing Gene Taylor, a 38-year veteran of the bank, who will retire at year end.
