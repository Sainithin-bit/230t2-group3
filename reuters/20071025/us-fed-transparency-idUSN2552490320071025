 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve is considering several steps to make its deliberations more transparent, but are likely to delay a decision on one of Chairman Ben Bernanke's goals: an explicit inflation target, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday. 

 Among the moves being considered is a release of economic forecasts four times a year, rather than twice yearly now, the paper said, citing people familiar with the matter. In addition, the Fed would extend the horizon for forecasts to three years from two, it said. Fed officials had hoped to finalize the initiatives this month, but credit market turmoil over the summer "complicated the agenda", the paper said.
