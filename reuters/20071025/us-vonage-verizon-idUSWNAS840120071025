 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Internet-based calling company Vonage Holdings Corp. ( VG.N ) said on Thursday that it settled a patent dispute with Verizon Communications Inc ( VZ.N ). 

 Vonage said the final terms of the settlement depend on a court of appeals decision on Vonage's petition for a rehearing on its patents, but the amount will be capped at $32 million in addition to $88 million already held in escrow. Vonage has been hit by a series of lawsuits since going public in May 2006. It has also been sued by AT&T Inc ( T.N ). (Reporting by  Ritsuko Ando )
