 MURFREESBORO, Tennessee  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Dennis Lockhart said on Friday there was still risk in the economic outlook and he had an "open mind" on the need for further cuts in interest rates. 

 "My intention is very much to signal neutrality on that question ... Where I come out on that question will depend on a spectrum of indicators," he told reporters after delivering a speech to the Middle Tennessee State University. Lockhart also said the economic outlook contained risks and recent economic indicators had been "somewhat mixed", while inflation expectations remained well anchored despite the Fed's half-percentage-point cut in rates to 4.75 percent on September 18.
