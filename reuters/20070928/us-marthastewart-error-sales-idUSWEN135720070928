 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc ( MSO.N ) said on Friday it erroneously reported 125 percent sales growth of "soft home" products sold at Kmart stores over a one-week period when compared to the same week a year earlier. 

 The company said it gave the figure at an advertising week conference in New York on Thursday. The company said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that same-store sales of the products rose 28 percent when compared to a year earlier, including a 124 percent increase in its fashion bedding products, a segment of its soft-home division. Kmart is owned by Sears Holdings Corp ( SHLD.O ). (Reporting by  Justin Grant )
