 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp. will shift responsibility to a new trust fund for retiree health care in 2010 and put $24.1 billion into that new fund by the start of next year, the United Auto Workers said on Friday. 

 The UAW said that the total GM commitment to "pre-fund" retiree health care was nearly $30 billion. The details of the health care trust, widely seen as the centerpiece of a new four-year labor contract between the UAW and GM reached this week, were contained in a union publication for GM's roughly 73,000 blue-collar workers.
