 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The chief executive of Freddie Mac 
FRE.N warned that the U.S. economy faces a 40 percent to 45 
percent risk of recession induced by the housing market 
downturn, the Financial Times reported on its Web site. 

  Richard Syron said the credit squeeze had left some parts 
of the U.S. housing market "literally frozen," the article 
said.  Syron forecast the Federal Reserve would make another 
"material" cut in interest rates, the report said.  According to the report, Syron also predicted that Congress 
would lift restraints on the operations of Freddie Mac and its 
sister mortgage company, Fannie Mae FNM.N.  Syron said the $417,000 ceiling on the size of home loans 
they can buy was likely to be raised to help support the U.S. 
mortgage market, the article said.  Freddie Mac was not immediately available for comment.
