 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Communications equipment maker 3Com Corp COMS.O has struck a deal to be bought by China's Huawei Technologies HWT.UL and private equity firm Bain Capital for more than $2 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday. 

 The offer values 3Com at more than $5 per share, the Journal said, citing a person familiar with the matter. 3Com shares rose 32.6 percent to $4.88 in premarket trade. The shares are halted on the Nasdaq pending news. In March, Marlborough, Massachusetts-based 3Com bought Huawei Technologies' 49 percent stake in H3C, a joint venture between the companies, for $882 million. That deal gave 3Com full ownership of H3C. Bain Capital is one of world's largest private equity firms. Huawei is China's largest communications equipment maker. A deal would be a positive sign for private equity firms, whose deal-making activity has been sharply curtailed by the credit crunch. By teaming up with a corporate partner, Bain will be less reliant on banks for money to fund the deal. A representative of 3Com was not immediately available to comment on the newspaper report. A Bain spokesman did not immediately return a call seeking comment. (Reporting by  Michael Flaherty  and  Sinead Carew )
