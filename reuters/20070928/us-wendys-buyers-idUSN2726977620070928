 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Thomas H. Lee Partners and Oak Hill Partners are among the private equity firms bidding for burger chain Wendy's International Inc WEN.N, sources said on Thursday, as the auction proceeds despite the impact of the credit crunch on deals. 

 Included in the Thomas H. Lee team are Oaktree Capital Management, Ares Management and title insurer Fidelity National Financial Inc ( FNF.N ), the sources said. The chairman of Fidelity National, William Foley, is a former chief executive of CKE Restaurants Inc CKR.N, the parent of the Carl's Jr. and Hardee's fast-food chains. A second group of bidders includes David Karam, a Wendy's franchisee and president of Cedar Enterprises Inc, said one source, who was familiar with the matter but did not want to be named. Karam told the Wall Street Journal his bid is being backed by the private equity firms Kelso & Co. and Oak Hill Capital Partners. The auction could proceed or fall apart, said one of the sources, who is a private equity bidder but did not want to be named. Financing for both groups is unclear, as the credit crunch has stopped banks from lending large sums to private equity's leveraged buyouts. Banks are seen to be reluctant to lend money for any deal above $1 billion in the current environment. Wendy's earnings before taxes, interest, depreciation and amortization -- a measure of cash flow -- was $303 million last year, according to Reuters data. Fast food company Dunkin' Donuts sold for more than 10 times EBITDA to private equity buyers. But the credit crunch has lowered company valuations significantly. Whether Wendy's can fetch that kind of multiple is unclear. Its market capitalization is $2.9 billion. JP Morgan and Lehman Brothers are running the process. In a sign of the times, the deal does not have staple financing, the private equity investor said. During the pre-credit crunch days of the buyout boom, nearly all deals came with staple financing, meaning the advisors had debt financing in place already, with a minimum purchase price set based on an EBITDA multiple. The Wall Street Journal said the second round of bids is expected to come in the next 30 days. Hedge fund activist investor Nelson Peltz has pushed for the shake up at the company. His fund owns a 9.8 percent stake in the company. Peltz's restaurant group, Triarc Companies Inc. TRY.N, parent of the Arby's fast- food chain, has been in ongoing discussions to buy Wendy's. Wendy's, Fidelity National and Karam were not immediately available for comment. Oak Hill declined to comment. Wendy's stock closed up 3.2 percent to $34.72 on Thursday.
