 MEXICO CITY  (Reuters) - Mexican brewer Modelo said on Thursday that Anheuser-Busch Inbev informed the company it will fight the U.S. Justice Department's lawsuit seeking to stop the Belgian-based brewer ( ABI.BR ) from buying the half of Modelo that it does not already own. 
 Grupo Modelo ( GMODELOC.MX ) no longer expects the deal to be completed in the first quarter, the company said in a statement to Mexico's stock exchange. The Mexican brewer added that it has no further comment on the U.S. Justice Department's announcement. (Reporting by Gabriel Stargardter)
