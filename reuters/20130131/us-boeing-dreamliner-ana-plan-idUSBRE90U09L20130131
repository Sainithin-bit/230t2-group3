 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's All Nippon Airways ( 9202.T ) said on Thursday it would delay the release of its two-year business plan initially slated for early February to the end of April because of the grounding of Boeing Co's ( BA.N ) 787 Dreamliner jets. 
 ANA, the launch airline for the 787 jet that has been grounded with undiagnosed battery problems, said it lost more than $15 million in revenue from having to cancel flights this month. (Reporting by  James Topham ; Editing by  Ron Popeski )
