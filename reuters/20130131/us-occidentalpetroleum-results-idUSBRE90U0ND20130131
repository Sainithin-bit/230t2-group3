 (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp ( OXY.N ), the fourth-largest U.S. oil company, reported a 79 percent drop in quarterly profit on Thursday as it wrote down the value of certain gas properties by $1.1 billion. 
 The company's net profit fell to $336 million, or 45 cents per share, in the fourth quarter from $1.6 billion, or $2.02 per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 2 percent to $6.17 billion. The charges were mainly related to gas assets in the Midcontinent, the company said. (Reporting by Swetha Gopinath and  Braden Reddall  in San Francisco; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)
