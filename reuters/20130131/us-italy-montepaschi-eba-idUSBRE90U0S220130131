 MILAN  (Reuters) - The European Banking Authority chief Andrea Enria said the new rules on derivatives under completion will reduce the chances of a new financial scandal like that emerged at Tuscan lender Monte dei Paschi di Siena ( BMPS.MI ). 
 "With the new rules on derivatives we are finalizing it will be more difficult to see a case (like Monte dei Paschi)," Enria said on the sidelines of a banking conference in Milan. "We have to avoid that this case (of Monte dei Paschi) lead to generalizations," Enria said, answering a question about the credibility of Italian banks.
