 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - European leaders want to boost the crisis-fighting resources of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) by the provision of up to 200 billion euros ($260 billion), as one of the ways to persuade markets that money invested in euro zone debt is safe. 
 The aim is for euro zone countries to provide 150 billion euros from their central banks and for other European and non-European countries to provide a further 50 billion euros. Mexico, which now chairs the Group of 20 heavyweight economies, is hopeful for an agreement among IMF member countries for an increase in IMF resources in the first months of 2012. EU leaders set Monday, December 19, as the deadline to decide which EU member country would contribute how much. Below are pledges made by various countries since Dec 9. EURO ZONE GERMANY The Bundesbank said it would be prepared to provide additional bilateral loans of up to 45 billion euros. But it would only be willing to do so if other EU and non-EU countries also provide additional funds. ESTONIA Estonian Prime Minister Andrus Ansip is in favour of joining other euro zone countries in contributing bilateral loans to the IMF, but needs to agree the technical details, the government's communication office said. BELGIUM Belgium would lend around 9.5 billion euros to the IMF, Belgian Central Bank Governor Luc Coene said. THE NETHERLANDS The Dutch parliament will support proposals to provide extra money to the International Monetary Fund as part of a solution to the euro zone debt crisis. The Netherlands, via its central bank, would lend a maximum of 17 billion euros to the IMF. SLOVAKIA Slovakia will contribute 1.53 billion euros to the IMF. NON-EURO ZONE EU POLAND Poland will lend an additional 6.3 billion euros to the International Monetary Fund, its finance minister said. BRITAIN Downing Street said it did not expect Britain to commit more than an additional 10 billion pounds ($15.5 billion) to the IMF. SWEDEN The Swedish central bank said it was ready to lend up to 100 billion Swedish crowns ($14.3 billion) to the IMF to help it support the euro zone. LITHUANIA Lithuania cannot afford to join other European countries in making a bilateral loan to the International Monetary Fund, the finance ministry spokeswoman said. LATVIA The Baltic state is just about to exit a bailout program led by the International Monetary Fund and European Union. Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis has said his country will not contribute any funds to the IMF boost. CZECH REPUBLIC The Czech government should ask the central bank to free reserves for a loan to the IMF only if all other countries outside the euro zone would give loans and Prague would be threatened by isolation if it does not, the Czech prime minister was quoted as saying. The Czech share would be about 3.5 billion euros, under a planned agreed by EU states last week. WORLD UNITED STATES The United States has been wary of additional resources for the International Monetary Fund to help Europe. JAPAN Japanese Finance Minister Jun Azumi expressed caution about any potential contribution by Japan to a rescue fund through the IMF, saying Japan would cooperate where it can but only after Europe comes up with a thorough scheme and resources needed to build a fire wall and prevent contagion of the debt crisis. CANADA Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney said more resources for the IMF was a decision for the government and that it would be taken in the context of a clearly specified resource need for resources for the global economy, not just Europe. RUSSIA Russia is committed to giving at least $10 billion through the International Monetary Fund to support Europe's efforts to stave off financial crisis, a Russian presidential aide said.
