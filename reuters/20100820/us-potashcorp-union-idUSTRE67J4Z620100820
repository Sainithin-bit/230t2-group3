 CALGARY, Alberta  (Reuters) - BHP Billiton must show that its planned acquisition of Potash Corp will have clear benefits for Canada before the federal government approves any deal, the union representing Potash Corp's Saskatchewan mine workers said on Friday 

 The United Steelworkers are asking the government to hold public hearings before blessing any deal that would see the world's biggest mining company take over the world's biggest fertilizer producer. Under the terms of the Investment Canada Act, which regulates foreign takeovers of Canadian companies, buyer must prove the purchase will be of net benefit to the country before they're allowed to proceed. While the government can conduct the process behind closed doors, the union wants it made public and wants its views heard. "On the basis of the union's review of BHP's offer ... the takeover has not demonstrated a clear net benefit to Canada," Ken Neumann, United Steelworkers' national director for Canada, said in a statement. "Such a takeover of a Canadian resource should not proceed until a net benefit is proven to Canadians under the federal Investment Canada Act and made public." BHP Billiton is bidding $130 a share for Potash Corp in a hostile bid that was formally launched on Friday. The offer, the largest this year in any industry, has been rejected by Potash Corp's board, which called it "grossly inadequate" and moved to drum up rival offers. The union has sent a letter to Marius Kloppers, BHP's chief executive, asking him to spell out guarantees for current and future jobs in Potash Corp's mines after any takeover, as well as detail planned investments and show how the province of Saskatchewan will benefit. The Steelworkers are also concerned about BHP's plans to pull Potash Corp out of Canpotex, the joint-venture marketing firm owned by the country's top potash miners -- Potash Corp, Agrium and Mosaic Co -- which negotiates prices and handles exports of the crop nutrient. That would be a selfish and reckless move," the union said. "It might be good for BHP but it certainly would not be good for the Saskatchewan industry, its workers or the people of Saskatchewan." Opposition to the deal comes despite some bad blood between the union and Potash Corp, which has often laid off workers under a strategy of cutting production when prices fall.
