 BANGALORE  (Reuters) - Expeditors International of Washington Inc said it, along with its Brazilian unit, received an administrative proceeding from the Brazilian Ministry of Justice, alleging the logistics firm infringed anti-competition laws. 

 In a statement, Seattle-based Expeditors said it intends to "vigorously" defend itself against the allegations. Should Expeditors be found to have committed the infringement, it may result in material fines and penalties, the company added. The company's shares, which have gained 21 percent of their value in the last six months, closed at $41.65 Friday on Nasdaq. (Reporting by  Bijoy Koyitty  in Bangalore; Editing by Maju Samuel)
