 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Hospira Inc ( HSP.N ) said its chief executive and chief operating officers, both in their 50s, would retire from the specialty drug and medication delivery company. 

 Chris Begley, 58, will remain in his CEO position until a successor is named, after which he will stay on as executive chairman. Chief Operating Officer Terrence Kearney, 55, will retire by the end of 2010. The announcement, which comes one day after it held a meeting with Wall Street analysts, was unexpected and sent Hospira shares down as much as 3.2 percent in morning trading. "There's no smoking gun here whatsoever," Begley said in a telephone interview, adding the job of CEO is all consuming and he seeks balance in his life. He said everything about the company, including its outlook for earnings, is "completely on track." "There is no change in market dynamics, all our programs are in place," Begley said. "This gives us an orderly transition. I'm going to stay on as executive chairman, sitting in same office as I've been in for the last 7 years. This gives us an opportunity to look for someone with global large company healthcare experience and bring them into this organization as CEO." The board has formed a search committee and hired executive search firm Egon Zehnder to find a new chief executive outside the company with a strong healthcare background and experience leading large multinational corporations. During a conference call with analysts, Begley said the search process was still in its early stages and did not say how long he expected the process to take. He said the company was not considering internal candidates because there was no one with the right experience. The company also said James Hardy, currently corporate vice president, supply chain, would assume the new position of senior vice president, operations, effective December 31. The shares of Hospira, which was spun off from Abbott Laboratories ( ABT.N ) six years ago, were down 2.8 percent at $50.71 at midday in New York. That is up about 88 percent from their closing on May 3, 2004, the first day of trading as an independent public company. (Reporting by Debra Sherman; editing by Gerald E.
