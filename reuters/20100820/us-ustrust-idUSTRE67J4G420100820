 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp's ( BAC.N ) U.S. Trust added eight wealth management executives on Friday, part of a spate of new hires in the past few months to replace bankers lost to rivals. 

 The private banking unit recruited Brian Sharpe from BlackRock Inc ( BLK.N ) to take the market investment executive post in Washington. Brett Rufkahr leaves TIAA-CREF to become a market executive for the St. Louis area. The hires are the latest additions in the bank's ongoing hiring campaign, U.S. Trust said in a statement. U.S. Trust also hired six more executives across the country, including David Litvack from Fitch Inc Ratings, Carla Jackson from Morgan Stanley Smith Barney ( MS.N ) and Tom Tagliarini from SunTrust Banks ( STI.N ). The private bank has quickened its hiring pace after losing 37 professionals in the year through June 30. (Reporting by Liana B.Baker, editing by Matthew Lewis)
