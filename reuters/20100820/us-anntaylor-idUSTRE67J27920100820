 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Women's clothing retailer AnnTaylor Stores Corp ( ANN.N ) said quarterly sales rebounded at its namesake stores and it was able to sell more merchandise at full price, sending shares up 2 percent. 

 Like other chains that cater to women over 35, such as Talbots Inc TLB.N and Chico's FAS Inc ( CHS.N ), Ann Taylor is working to freshen up its fashions and turn around its fortunes after struggling with weak sales for several quarters. At the Ann Taylor chain, same-store sales rose 19.6 percent in the second quarter, compared with a 38 percent tumble in the same period a year ago. That helped boost overall comparable sales, which include online purchases, by 6.1 percent. Chief Executive Kay Krill said that skirts and suits for the workplace had been selling especially well at Ann Taylor. "Women are re-entering the workforce and I think that that is going to be very important for the Ann Taylor brand and we are top of mind for that," Krill said on a conference call with analysts. Wedbush analyst Betty Chen said Ann Taylor had greatly improved its wear-to-work merchandise compared with last year, drawing shoppers needing to update their professional wardrobe from rivals. "(It's) become a much higher priority destination" for women shoppers, Chen said. The company expects momentum to continue even as the wider retail industry faces soft consumer demand. It forecast total sales of $495 million and a "high-to-mid single digit" percentage increase in comparable sales in the current quarter. The company announced an increase in its share buyback program to $400 million, and Chief Financial Officer Michael Nicholson said it considers its shares to be undervalued. Shares were up 32 cents or 2.1 percent at $15.79 on Friday morning on the New York Stock Exchange. AnnTaylor shares have lost about 37 percent of their value since May 5, when they hit a yearly high of $25.24. Total sales rose nearly 2.8 percent to $483.5 million, but fell short of analysts' expectations of $503.3 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income was $18.6 million, or 31 cents per share, in the second quarter ended July 31, compared with a year-earlier loss of $18 million, or 32 cents per share. Excluding a restructuring charge, the company earned 32 cents per share, in line with analysts' forecasts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Internet sales also gave the company a boost. At the more casual and less expensive LOFT division, a 54.6 percent jump in online revenue made up for a 3.1 percent drop in same-store sales. Krill said LOFT has missed out on some sales because it has not had enough tops for the early fall to meet demand. Inventories on a square-foot basis were up 8.3 percent at the end of the quarter from a year earlier, and Krill told analysts they would be sufficient to meet anticipated demand. Gross margins rose 2.6 percentage points to 55 percent, helped by fewer markdowns at Ann Taylor stores. The company operates nearly 900 stores, including about 280 Ann Taylor stores and 506 LOFT stores. It expects 56 stores to close across both brands for the year, and plans to open 30 new stores, primarily for the LOFT chain. (Reporting by Phil Wahba, editing by Gerald E.
