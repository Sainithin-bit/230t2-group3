 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Hormel Foods Corp's ( HRL.N ) higher-priced refrigerated and specialty foods boosted third-quarter results as consumers traded up from cheaper lunch meats. 

 "There's been increasingly promotional spending throughout the consumer product space," said Erin Swanson, an analyst with Morningstar. "Consumers are being selective. They have the ability to trade back up because those price gaps have narrowed." Morningstar rates Hormel shares a "hold," she said. Rising hog prices and other costs increases for materials hurt profits for grocery products, which includes Spam, Dinty Moore stew and Hormel Compleats microwaveable meals. Hormel expects higher materials costs to continue into the fourth quarter, Chief Executive Jeffrey Ettinger said. The company has announced price increases for hash, corned beef, hams and bacon. Sales of Spam meat products, which drew a renewed following early in the recession, fell in the quarter. "Spam is a product that, given its long shelf life, retailers have a great deal of flexibility as to when to feature it," Ettinger said in an interview. "We're not overly concerned about the fact that we had a down quarter with it." Hormel said newer products such as party trays sold well, helped by celebrations for school graduations and Independence Day. Hormel also reported improvement in food-service channels that struggled in previous quarters. Hormel's net income rose to $85.4 million, or 63 cents per share, from $77.2 million, or 57 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting 60 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales rose 10 percent to $1.73 billion, topping analysts' average forecast of $1.67 billion. The company raised its full-year earnings forecast to a range of $2.85 to $2.91 a share from its May forecast of $2.75 to $2.85. Analysts on average were expecting $2.84. Hormel shares were flat at $43.37 on Friday in late afternoon trade, but not far from their 52-week high of $44.15 touched on July 27.
