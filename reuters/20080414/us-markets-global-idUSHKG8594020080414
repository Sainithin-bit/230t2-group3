 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The dollar slipped and government debt prices rose on Monday as the outlook for the U.S. economy remained mired in gloom and a surprise loss at the No. 4 U.S. bank stoked fears that the global credit crisis would worsen. 

 Oil prices jumped on an unexpected rise in U.S. gasoline sales in March. Gold bounced back in reaction to a weakening dollar and rising crude oil prices. Stocks fell in Europe and traded little changed at midday in the United States after spending much of the morning underwater as the Wachovia loss and disappointing earnings at Philips Electronics kept investors cautious about equities. Data on both sides of the Atlantic did little to dispel the sour mood in markets and over the U.S. economic outlook. U.S. retail sales rose an unexpected 2 percent in March, spurred by record high gasoline costs. Excluding gasoline, retail sales were flat, the U.S. Commerce Department report said. British manufacturers increased prices in March at the fastest rate since 1991 after the strongest rise in costs since records began being kept more than two decades ago, raising the risk of a sharp consumer price spike. The weak results from Wachovia Corp WB.N -- the No. 4 U.S. bank -- and European newspaper reports of further write-downs at Credit Suisse revived worries about the extent of the global credit crisis. Wachovia reported an upsurge in credit problems stemming from mortgages and other debt, triggering a fresh wave of fixed-income buying among investors already rattled by General Electric Co's ( GE.N ) disappointing results on Friday. "This is just one more in a growing list of financial services companies that are struggling to keep the ship upright," said Kevin Giddis, managing director of fixed-income trading at Morgan Keegan in Memphis, Tennessee. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose 3/32 in price to yield 3.4656 percent. The two-year U.S. Treasury note rose 1/32 to yield 1.7213 percent, while the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond fell 2/32 to yield at 4.3064 percent. Trading on Wall Street was choppy. Shares in Wachovia fell more than 10 percent, and the Standard & Poor's financial sector index .GSPF was down about 1.9 percent. "Bad news is the standard order of the day, and the market is not going to jump through hoops for these numbers," said Peter Kenny, managing director at Knight Equity Markets in Jersey City, New Jersey, referring to Wachovia. "I don't think anyone's shocked Wachovia is having to grapple with this," Kenny said. "GE was a bigger drag because it speaks to a much larger, global footprint." In early afternoon trading in New York, the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was up 15.39 points, or 0.12 percent, at 12,340.81. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was down 0.43 points, or 0.03 percent, at 1,332.40. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was down 2.89 points, or 0.13 percent, at 2,287.35. European stocks fell for the fifth session in a row, led by Credit Suisse ( CSGN.VX ) after newspaper reports of further write-downs at the Swiss bank and on Philips Electronics' ( PHG.AS ) disappointing first-quarter earnings. The FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of leading European shares closed 0.76 percent lower at 1,275 points. The index is down about 15 percent for the year. Credit Suisse shares lost 3.3 percent after weekend news reports said it could announce further write-downs of up to 5 billion Swiss francs ($5 billion) when it posts first-quarter results later this month. The bank declined to comment on the reports. Shares in Philips, whose core profit fell 28 percent, dropped 3.3 percent to their lowest close since mid-July 2006. Euro zone government bond prices edged lower. Traders said investors appeared to be holding cash rather than adding to bond portfolios as European bourses and Wall Street endured selling. Asian shares, reacting for the first time to last week's news, lurched lower as the nasty earnings surprise from GE and a 26-year low in U.S. consumer sentiment reported on Friday outweighed the Group of Seven nation's support for the dollar in a weekend meeting. Japan's Nikkei average index  .N225  fell 3.1 percent while shares across the rest of Asia, gauged by MSCI's index .MIAPJ0000PUS, slid 2.3 percent. The dollar slipped, surrendering earlier gains. "The dollar remains under pressure with an overnight decline in equities reflecting heightened risk aversion," said Michael Woolfolk, senior currency strategist, at Bank of New York Mellon. The dollar was down against a basket of major trading-partner currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index .DXY down 0.72 percent at 71.758. The euro was up 0.13 percent at $1.5825 and against the yen, the dollar was down 0.07 percent at 100.8. Oil prices jumped on an unexpected rise in U.S. gasoline sales in March, which also pushed the country's overall retail sales higher for the month. A brief U.S. pipeline shutdown and some production losses in Nigeria also helped bolster crude prices. U.S. light sweet crude oil rose 99 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $111.13 per barrel. Gold buying gathered pace after the dollar turned negative against the euro and oil prices jumped. A weaker dollar makes gold cheaper for holders of other currencies and often lifts bullion demand. The metal is also generally seen as a hedge against oil-led inflation. Spot gold prices rose $1.80, or 0.19 percent, to $926.70.
