 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wachovia Corp Chief Executive Ken Thompson on Monday said the fourth-largest U.S. bank received no pressure from regulators to raise new capital or cut its dividend, but it did so to bolster its balance sheet for expected increases in credit losses. 

 Earlier Monday, Wachovia announced plans to raise $7 billion of capital and lower its common stock dividend 41 percent. It also reported a surprise first-quarter loss. "We had no regulator at any time approach us and ask us to raise capital (or) to cut our dividend; zero, not one conversation," Thompson said on a conference call. He called the decisions "the right thing to do at this point." (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel, editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
