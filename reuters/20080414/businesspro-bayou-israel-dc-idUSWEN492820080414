 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A judge sentenced the co-founder of 
the defunct hedge fund Bayou Group to 20 years in prison on 
Monday for his role in a scheme that cheated investors out of 
more than $400 million. 

  Samuel Israel III, 48, pleaded guilty in September 2005 to 
charges of conspiracy and fraud in connection with bilking 
Bayou investors out of millions.  The demise of Connecticut-based Bayou rocked the $1.8 
trillion hedge fund industry and led to calls for more 
oversight.  (Reporting by  Martha Graybow  and  Leslie Gevirtz ; editing by
