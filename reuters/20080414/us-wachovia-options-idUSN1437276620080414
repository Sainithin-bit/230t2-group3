 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Investors appeared to have made bearish bets on Wachovia Corp before the bank reported an unexpected quarterly loss on Monday, prompting questions among option traders on whether the news was leaked ahead of time. 

 Wachovia posted a surprise first-quarter loss early on Monday. The No. 4 U.S. bank said it would cut its dividend, eliminate jobs and raise $7 billion of capital after being hurt by credit conditions. Its shares fell 8.13 percent to $25.55. But ahead of the earnings announcement -- originally scheduled for April 18 before being moved up over the weekend -- some lucky players aggressively scooped up Wachovia put options late last week. The put trading was extremely heavy on Friday as traders appeared to be speculating on a bearish event affecting earnings, said Jon Najarian, a founder of Web information site optionmonster.com in Chicago. A large part of that put activity involved May option contracts, allowing investors to sell Wachovia shares at $30 minus the premium paid. "It does look suspicious just because the trading in the Wachovia $30 strike puts was so aggressive and so concentrated in the trading session immediately preceding their surprise first quarter loss," said Henry Schwartz, president of Trade Alert, an option analytics firm In this case, it is an interesting trade considering that the stock was flat on Friday, he added. The shares closed at  $27.81. The U.S. Securities and Exchange commission declined to comment on the unusual option trading. Investors often turn to equity puts as a way to speculate on potential share price weakness or to insure their stock positions against adverse stock moves. To be sure, the circumstances surrounding the trading in Wachovia puts may reflect just plain luck or speculation. Still, the unusual surge in Wachovia put options on Friday is too much of a coincidence to overlook. "The traders were right far more than they knew or they knew far more than was publicly available," Najarian said. Friday's option volume stood at around 80,000 contracts, of which 61,000 were puts, above the normal combined level of about 70,000 contracts, according to Trade Alert. The daily ratio of puts to calls was more than 3 to 1 on that day, up from Wachovia's typical put/call ratio, which is closer to equal numbers of each, Trade Alert data showed. At that time, with Wachovia shares down 14 cents at $27.73, some 24,300 May $30 puts were apparently bought against previous contracts outstanding for that strike of only 1,148, indicating new positions were initiated, option traders said. Most of them were bought at $3.40 a contract, said Henry Schwartz, president of Trade Alert. Priced at $5.20 apiece on Monday, the put contract rose $1.40 from Friday's close. In order for those in-the-money puts to pay off, Wachovia shares had to trade below $26.60 through May expiration. "Those puts turned out to be a bargain because the implied volatility on Wachovia options had not yet increased as much as they normally would do the day before earnings," said Randy Frederick, director of derivatives at Charles Schwab.
