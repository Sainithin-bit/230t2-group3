 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ) is looking to sell much less than $20 billion of loans financing leveraged buyouts, a person briefed on the matter said on Monday. 

 The Wall Street Journal reported earlier on Monday that Deutsche Bank was looking to sell up to $20 billion of loans to offload debt clogging its balance sheet. But the source said any sale is expected to be much less than $20 billion, potentially less than half that figure. (Reporting by  Dan Wilchins ; editing by John Wallace)
