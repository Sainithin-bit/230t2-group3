 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - At its analyst meeting last year, J.C. Penney Co Inc ( JCP.N ) outlined an aggressive growth plan that included opening 250 new stores over the next five years. 

 But when the mid-tier department store operator meets with Wall Street analysts this Tuesday and Wednesday, it is expected to take a more cautious tone, as the last 12 months have not been kind to the retailer. Penney's middle-income consumers have been hit hard by the weakening U.S. economy. More consumers' paychecks are going toward paying for necessities like food and fuel at the same time as their home values are declining and their access to credit has diminished. Worried that their financial situation will worsen amid talk of a recession, Penney's shoppers have reined in discretionary spending. Last month, Penney warned that its first-quarter profit could be as much as 38 percent below its initial forecast. Its shares, which closed at $38.45 on Friday, are now trading more than 50 percent below where they were a year ago, and analysts expect the retailer may use its analyst meeting to temper its timeline for achieving the growth targets it outlined last year. "We believe it is likely that executives will maintain prior financial targets, but move them out given near-term macro uncertainty," wrote Goldman Sachs analyst Adrianne Shapira in a research note. NAVIGATING GROWTH At last year's analyst meeting, Penney said that as part of a 2007-2011 growth plan, it would open 250 new stores over the next five years, including its first-ever store in New York City's Midtown Manhattan. It said it expected a 16 percent compound annual growth rate in earnings per share for fiscal years 2008-2011 and capital expenditures of $1.275 billion per year for 2008-2011. But its sales have taken a hit since it outlined those goals. Sales at stores open at least a year, a key retail gauge known as same-store sales, have fallen every month since November, when it posted a gain of 2.6 percent. It has forecast another decline for April same-store sales. It has already tempered its view for new store openings as business conditions have deteriorated, saying in January that it might cut 10 or more of the 50 stores it planned to open each year in 2008 and 2009. Charles Grom, an analyst with JPMorgan, said in a research note that he would like to know what the retailer's new same-store sales, margin and earnings expectations are for its current fiscal year. "Also, given the reduction in April sales view, is management still comfortable with its $0.50 earnings per share view for 1Q?" he wrote. Shapira said that retailer could "highlight 2007's accomplishments along with current opportunities to drive the strategy forward. "We suspect many of these 'forward looking' initiatives will be recast for the current challenging macro environment -- for example marketing that emphasizes J.C. Penney's value," she noted. PRIVATE BRANDS, INCREASED RISK? Dana Telsey, a retail analyst with Telsey Advisory Group, said she will be listening to hear what Penney has to say about its merchandising strategy and its inventory planning. Penney has been introducing private brands to distinguish itself from competitors like Kohl's Corp ( KSS.N ) and Macy's Inc ( M.N ), and in February, it introduced American Living, the biggest merchandise launch in its history. Developed by Polo Ralph Lauren Corp's ( RL.N ) Global Brand Concepts division exclusively for Penney, the line is expected to cover 40 merchandise categories, including men's and women's clothing, luggage, handbags, bedding and window treatments. Penney has said the line will eventually reach annual sales of $1 billion, and it should play a critical role in its future. But analysts have been skeptical about the timing of the brand, which hit stores as its consumers pulled back, and they have worried that the large brand introduction could saddle the retailer with excess inventory if it did not sell well. Last week, Penney said its March same-store sales fell 12.3 percent, and the sales declines were "broad-based," extending across most of its merchandise categories. But the retailer said consumers continue to respond "positively" to American Living. (Reporting by Nicole Maestri, editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
