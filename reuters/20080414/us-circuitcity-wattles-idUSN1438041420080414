 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Investor Mark Wattles, who has nominated five people to the board of Circuit City Stores CC.N, on Monday said billionaire investor Carl Icahn was willing to help fund Blockbuster Inc's BBI.N proposed buyout of the electronics chain. 

 "I did get confirmation that he supported the transaction and (was) willing to put up capital to get the transaction done," Wattles said in a interview on the CNBC network. Wattles, who has called for the ouster of Circuit City's chief executive, added that "the Blockbuster acquisition alternative certainly looks attractive at this point."
