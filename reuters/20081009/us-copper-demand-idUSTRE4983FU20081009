 LONDON  (Reuters) - Rapidly deteriorating prospects for manufacturers around the world have prompted analysts to cut forecasts for copper consumption this year and next, but so far few expect demand growth to turn negative. 

 Some are forecasting overall copper demand growth to fall to zero this year from rises of 2-3 percent previously. For next year, demand growth is expected to slip below 3 percent from near 5 percent previously. "You should get a significant trimming of industrial metals demand that won't really turnaround until Chinese demand picks up," said Michael Jansen, analyst at JP Morgan. "The only other thing that could change the outlook is if we get a synchronized recovery rather than the synchronized recession we are seeing at the moment." Lower demand growth expectations have hit prices of copper used in power and construction and seen as a benchmark for overall industrial metals demand. Copper prices in London are down about 40 percent since a record high of $8,940 a tonne in July, when the market started to price in the probability that China would not be able to offset falling demand in the United States and Europe. At the root of the problem is the crisis in financial markets, which has escalated in recent weeks and provoked a flurry of downgrades for economic growth. Many now expect recession in the United States, Britain and the euro zone and think the spillover into emerging countries such as China will be more damaging than previously thought. "The events of the past few weeks have changed the economic landscape and with it the outlook for metals demand," said Gayle Berry, analyst at Barclays Capital. "Not only does U.S. consumption look as though it will be weak for longer, but European consumption has fallen quickly and sharply and we don't think the worst is over yet. SCUPPERED HOPES Reinforcing concerns about metals demand is the recent report from the International Monetary Fund, which now expects global economic growth to slip to 3 percent next year from 3.9 percent this year and 5 percent in 2007. A major indicator of copper demand used by analysts is industrial production, which in top consumer China rose by just under 13 percent year-on-year in August from above 15 percent at the beginning of the year. Meanwhile industrial production in the United States, the world's second largest consumer of copper, shrank by 1.5 percent in August from the same month a year ago. "Industrial production in the fourth quarter is going to fall on an annualized basis," Jansen said. "The fall might continue into next year ... The real issue is demand growth for 2009." Analysts say the chances of further downgrades for next year are high, especially if Chinese demand doesn't pick up. That is partly because hopes of a pick-up in demand from China after the Olympics have been disappointed. "There is early evidence that the ripples of the slowdown in developed economies are spreading to China and this has scuppered market hopes for a post-Olympic pick up in consumption," Berry said. Another sign of dwindling demand are stocks of copper in London Metal Exchange warehouses, which at above 209,000 tonnes are up more than 15 percent since the start of September. "Given de-stocking in the copper market has occurred in large part over the past several years it is very unlikely to see significant negative consumption growth for copper," said Daniel Brebner, analyst at UBS. "Our base case (recession) results in a surplus of copper of roughly 400,000 in 2009. A worst case results in a surplus of copper of roughly 750,000 in 2009." The International Copper Study Group industry body is more optimistic. It expects a surplus of 275,000 tonnes next year and sees global copper demand in 2009 at 18.876 million tonnes, down from its April estimate of nearly 19.5 million tonnes.
