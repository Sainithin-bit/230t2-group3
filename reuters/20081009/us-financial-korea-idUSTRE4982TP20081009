 SEOUL  (Reuters) - South Korea rushed on Thursday to cut interest rates and join a series of similar cuts from global central banks, sparking a wild day of currency trading as it tries to give the economy an urgently needed lift from the global credit crisis. 

 The won slumped as much as 6 percent in early dealings on continued fears the economy could buckle under the strain of the financial storm that has toppled banks from as far afield as the United States to Iceland. But the won rebounded after the rate cut, helped by what currency dealers suspected was state intervention, rising some 8 percent from its lows for the currency's biggest one-day swing since early 1998, when the Asian financial crisis took South Korea to the brink of default. Still, both the won and the main stock market index are down around a third so far this year and analysts weren't convinced that a rate cut would shield the economy from the financial crisis unleashed last month by the collapse of Lehman Brothers. "Despite the interest rate cut, market participants doubt whether the roots of market problems will be improved," said Bae Sung-young, a market analyst at Hyundai Securities. The Bank of Korea cut its base rate to 5.00 percent from a 7-year high of 5.25 percent, saying inflation would stay above its target for a considerable period, but it judged the rate cut would help soothe its troubled financial markets and avoid a severe contraction in economic activity. The rate cut came after U.S., European and Chinese central banks slashed their interest rates in concert by up to 50 basis points on Wednesday, hoping to halt a downward spiral in markets as the world grapples with its worst financial crisis in decades. Korean stocks closed up 0.64 percent, finding some support from the rate cut although they had traded nearly 3-percent higher earlier in the session. "In countries like South Korea, where capital markets are not that much developed, an interest rate cut has the more positive effect of lifting the currency by boosting equities prices and brightening the economic outlook," Lim Ji-won, an economist at JPMorgan Chase in Seoul, said. After wild swings, the won was up 1 percent in late trading at 1,381.9/3.1 to the dollar, ending a four-session losing streak in which the currency fell more than 12 percent. "The won may rebound further, probably to as much as to 1,200, as global authorities may announce further measures during the G7 meeting later this week," said Jeon Seung-ji, an analyst at Samsung Futures Inc. "Still, no measures can solve the current situation," she added. The biggest concern is increasingly tight dollar liquidity, putting banks and companies at risk of being unable to meet foreign debt repayments. Added to which, Korean banks are more reliant on the fickle short-term money markets at the heart of the global credit crisis because of a high ratio of loans to deposits. Officials have been at pains to dismiss suggestions that South Korea faces a repeat of the 1997/98 Asian financial crisis that almost broke the economy. They have said Korea's foreign reserves of $240 billion, the world's sixth largest, can be used to make sure there are enough dollars in the local market. Still, President Lee Myung-bak has called for a summit with Asian economic powers China and Japan, noting the three countries have some $1.8 trillion in reserves to mount a defense against the global crisis. The Bank of Korea's rate cut was its first since late 2004 and the first after a string of eight rate increases. Central bank Governor Lee Seong-tae indicated there may be more cuts in coming months, calling the economic situation more serious than traditional cyclical movements. He estimated that economic growth in the second half of the year would fall below 3.9 percent and doubted inflation would slow sharply, saying the weak won would have a negative influence on prices. But he did hold out hope that the current account would move back into a surplus in the fourth quarter on resilient exports and weaker oil prices.
