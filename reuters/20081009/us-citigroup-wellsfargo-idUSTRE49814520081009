 (Reuters) - Talks between Citigroup Inc ( C.N ), Wells Fargo & Co ( WFC.N ) and the U.S. government over a way to divide Wachovia Corp WB.N between its two suitors were hung up on several key issues Wednesday, The Wall Street Journal said citing people familiar with the situation. 

 After looking deeper into Wachovia's books, Citigroup and Wells Fargo have been surprised by the concentration of assets they regard as low-quality, the paper said, citing the people. Both banks are worried that buying even part of Wachovia could saddle them with steeper losses than previously expected, the paper said. The two would-be buyers have also been sparring over the computer system used in Wachovia's retail branches, one person familiar with the discussions told the paper. Citigroup wants full control of Wachovia's system when the deal closes, while Wells Fargo wants the system to be shared temporarily, the paper said. People close to the discussions told the paper that they remain hopeful that a deal can be reached. A Citigroup spokesperson declined to comment. Wells Fargo did not immediately return calls seeking comment. (Reporting by  Ajay Kamalakaran  in Bangalore; Editing by Mike Nesbit)
