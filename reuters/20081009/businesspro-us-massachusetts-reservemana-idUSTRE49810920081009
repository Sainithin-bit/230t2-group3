 (Reuters) - Massachusetts regulators are investigating complaints about Reserve Management Co, the owner of and investment adviser to Reserve Primary Fund which "broke the buck" last month and sparked a run on U.S. money-market funds, The Wall Street Journal said. 

 The office of Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin has received some complaints about Reserve Management and is looking into them, the paper cited Brian McNiff, a spokesman for the office, as saying. Reserve Management did not immediately return a call seeking comment. William Galvin's office could not be immediately reached for comment by Reuters. The Primary Fund announced on September 16 that the par value of its shares had "broken the buck," or fallen below $1, to $0.97 because the bankruptcy filing the previous day of Lehman Brothers Holdings LEHMQ.PK forced it to revalue the $785 million of Lehman securities it held as "zero." It was the first time in 14 years a money-market fund, traditionally considered ultra-safe investments, had "broken the buck." The event triggered huge withdrawals not only from the fund but also from the entire industry as investors fled. (Reporting by  Ajay Kamalakaran  in Bangalore)
