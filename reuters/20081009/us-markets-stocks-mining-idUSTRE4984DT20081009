 LONDON  (Reuters) - Mining stocks, the darlings of investors in the first half of 2008, run the risk of ranking among the worst performers by year end as a commodity boom runs out of steam and metals prices tumble. 

 But analysts say the long-term growth story for commodities remains intact, fed by still strong demand in countries such as China and India. In the shorter term, however, investors need to be more discerning in their choices, avoiding single-metal firms. The DJ Stoxx Basic Resources index surged 46 percent in the four months to mid-May 2008, but has slid 58 percent since then, driven by a 15-50 percent slump in commodities prices and the broader rout in the equities market. Basic resources stocks are down 50 percent this year, an even worse performance than banking stocks, which have been hard hit by the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. The banking index has fallen 43 percent so far this year. Shares in major companies such as BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto, Xstrata and Eurasian Natural Resources have slumped between 50 and 70 percent since mid-May after rising 35 to 155 percent in the previous four months. "The metals and mining sector continues to bear the brunt of a transition from momentum to value. We continue to favor the large caps which look most attractive on valuation and have greater earnings stability and cost control," Citigroup said in a recent report on the sector. The broker cut 2009 earnings estimates for the metals and mining sector by 20 to 40 percent, with the largest downgrades coming at the more leveraged single commodity companies. And there seems to be no silver lining in the months ahead. "It's quite clear that commodities had been in a bubble phase for the last 2-3 years and we are now seeing that bubble bursting," said Peter Dixon, economist at Commerzbank. "As we head into 2009, I suspect a lot of the capacity which has been put in place will come online at a time when the demand is slowing," he added. STILL CHEAP, GETTING CHEAPER Prices of key metals are on a slippery ground, with analysts forecasting further declines ahead. Analysts have cut their 2009 forecast for the aluminum price by around 25 percent, copper by more than 20 percent and nickel by some 40 percent. And there are dealing risks as well. "Dealing with counterparties, who you don't know are going to be around tomorrow, is a big risk. Market liquidity has declined to very low levels," said Calyon analyst Robin Bhar. The prospects for mergers and acquisitions, which also boosted stock prices in the first half of this year, are also waning and forcing investors to trade cautiously in a volatile market. Fears about loan refinancing forced Xstrata to drop its $10 billion bid for Lonmin and made financing harder for the few lucrative M&A deals bankers are still working on, such as BHP Billiton's hostile bid of more than $100 billion for Rio Tinto. The syndicated loan market, the primary source of funds for M&As, has all but dried up as it is becoming harder for banks to sell loans due to spiraling funding costs while the number of lenders shrinks. Global M&A activity fell 25 percent in the first nine months of 2008, Thomson Reuters data showed. "You can run, but you can't hide," said Mike Lenhoff, chief strategist at Brewin Dolphin, referring to the present day market conditions and volatile trade. LONG-TERM GROWTH STORY INTACT Analysts said that over the long-term, commodity stocks were expected to do well as economic growth in countries such as China and India would continue to drive demand for metals and oils. The International Monetary Fund said on Wednesday the world economy was set for a major downturn, with the United States and Europe either in or on the brink of recession. China and India will also experience slower growth on weaker exports, but should continue to be supported by solid private consumption. China consumes about a quarter of global copper output, besides being the world's biggest consumer of steel in the world and the top producer of aluminum. "Base metal prices have already moved sharply toward their marginal costs. There is longer-term upside potential for prices from the metals-intensive industrialization of China and India and projects are being delayed because of financing issues and economic uncertainty," said Piers Aldred, analyst at Baring Asset Management. "The Chinese government has fiscal and monetary levers to keep growth very strong." Nick Hatch, an analyst at ING, said investors were focusing on short-term credit crunch newsflow and were ignoring the longer-term demand fundamentals in the leading developing economies, particularly related to infrastructure development. ING retained its longer-term positive view on the sector reiterated its buy recommendations on BHP Billiton, Xstrata, Rio Tinto and Anglo American. It preferred BHP Billiton, which benefits from its greater exposure to commodities, such as coal, iron ore and manganese ore, priced by negotiation with customers. It said that in the longer term, BHP would continue to develop its project pipeline. "The outlook for the mining industry, with its reliance on faster-growing developing markets, must surely remain a more attractive proposition than many sectors that rely solely on consumer and investor confidence in developed markets," Hatch said.
