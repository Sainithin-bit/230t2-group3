 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of foreign companies traded in the United States fell on Thursday as recession fears grew and investors questioned whether a coordinated interest rate cut would contain the credit crisis. 

 The Bank of New York Mellon's index of leading American Depositary Receipts fell 1.9 percent while the Dow Jones industrial average was off 1.7 percent at 9,098.65. Despite less demand for government bonds, gold and low-yielding currencies as some risk-taking crept back into markets, shares of overseas companies suffered as uncertainty about the economy persisted. November crude futures dropped 1.9 percent to $87.10 a barrel. Bank of New York Mellon's European ADR index lost 2.4 percent while the FTSEurofirst 300, an index of top European stocks, ended down 2.1 percent as bank and oil shares fell. Bank stocks have been unable to shake outsized fears about the toxic assets they hold on their books and dire predictions about how the credit crisis will hurt their profits, while falling oil prices hit energy firm shares. Among UK energy stocks, the ADRs for both National Grid and BP Plc fell in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, dropping 7.3 percent to $52.93 and 5 percent to $42.45, respectively. Asian stocks fared better, with both the Bank of New York Mellon's Asian ADR index and the Shanghai Composite Index down less than 1 percent. The best performer was the Bank of New York Mellon's Latin America ADR Index, which advanced 4 percent. In Brazil, stocks rallied as central bank interventions boosted the national currency.
