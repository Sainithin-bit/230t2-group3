 (Reuters) - Life insurer MetLife Inc ( MET.N ) recently approached life and property insurer Hartford Financial Services Group Inc ( HIG.N ) about a merger transaction, The Wall Street Journal said citing people familiar with the discussions. 

 The talks didn't lead anywhere, the people told the paper. MetLife and Hartford did not immediately return calls seeking comment. MetLife, the latest big U.S. insurer to struggle with the credit crisis, said on Wednesday it sold 75 million shares at $26.50 per share, raising nearly $2 billion. The secondary offering of shares was designed to bolster its balance sheet and potentially allow it to make acquisitions. Earlier this week, Allianz SE ( ALVG.DE ), Europe's biggest insurer, said it would invest $2.5 billion in Hartford. (Reporting by  Ajay Kamalakaran  in Bangalore)
