 SEOUL  (Reuters) - South Korea on Sunday announced long-anticipated curbs on banks' currency trades, saying it aimed to rein in short-term foreign debt and volatile capital flows that posed a risk to the world's ninth-biggest exporter. 

 The new steps will cover all currency derivatives trades, including non-deliverable forwards (NDFs), cross-currency swaps and forwards. Following is a collection of comments from bankers and analysts in response to the measures: - - - - HEAD OF A FOREIGN BANK'S SEOUL BRANCH, WHO ASKED NOT TO BE NAMED DUE TO THE SENSITIVITY OF THE MATTER: "Foreign banks and institutional investors will eventually adapt to the changed regulations without causing much significant problems in the financial markets. But I think the authorities could have done it in a more gradual way, such as setting a high ceiling and then later lowering it over time." "The reason the markets reacted so wildly to the talk of controls recently was that this new set of rules could mark the start of a series of additional controls in the coming months." LEE JIN-WOO, SENIOR FX ANALYST, NH INVESTMENT & FUTURES "The government could have done this when the foreign exchange market was fluctuating wildly due to the mismatch problem (in foreign funds several years ago). Now it's time when many people are worried about a possible outflow due to the European fiscal crisis. I think these new measures could drive the won down too much." HEAD OF ANOTHER FOREIGN BANK'S SEOUL BRANCH, SPEAKING ON THE CONDITION OF ANONIMITY: "It looks like there are political reasons behind making such an announcement at this time when the government is hosting G20 summit this year and financial markets are stabilizing." "The only short-term impact will be a reduction in short-term foreign borrowing, with foreign banks curtailing borrowing. This may be what the government wants to see in the short term." "But the measures may cause market volatility to rise further in the near term. Doing arbitrage trade in South Korea will be unprofitable to foreign banks and foreign banks may move the arbitrage trade outside OF South Korea due to regulation risks here."
