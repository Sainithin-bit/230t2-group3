 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. wholesale inventories fell for the fifth straight month in January and sales dropped amid a slump in demand, data showed on Tuesday, indicating a further reduction in estimates of fourth-quarter output. 

 The Commerce Department said total January wholesale inventories dropped 0.7 percent after declining 1.5 percent in December. The drop was below market expectations for a 1 percent contraction. Analysts said the data could see fourth-quarter gross domestic product estimates revised further down, when the Commerce Department releases its final figures later this month. "Today's data imply a $1 billion downward wholesale inventory revision in the next fourth-quarter GDP report ... to leave a big downward revision that we still peg at minus 6.7 percent," said Mike Englund, chief economist at Action Economics in Boulder, Colarado. Government data last month showed the economy contracted at a 6.2 percent annualized pace in the fourth quarter, the deepest decline since early 1982, hit by faltering spending and exports, and reduced contribution from inventory growth. "For the first quarter, we continue to expect a $16 billion inventory subtraction and a 5.0 percent GDP drop," Englund said. U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data, with attention focused on news that the chief executive officer of Citigroup had said the troubled bank was profitable in the first two months of 2009. SALES FALL FASTER THAN INVENTORIES Inventories in January were depressed by record drops of 4.8 percent in autos and 3.5 percent in furniture as companies sharply cut back output to deal with slackening demand as the economy battles a 14-month recession led by housing. Compared with the same period a year ago, inventories rose 1 percent. Sales fell 2.9 percent in January after declining a revised 3.7 percent in December. Overall sales were dragged down by a record 6.5 percent dive in durable goods sales. "Sales are falling faster than wholesalers can reduce inventories," said Kim Whelan, an economic analyst at Wachovia in Charlotte, North Carolina. Household incomes have been pinched by a combination of rising unemployment and plummeting asset values, causing consumers to shun big-ticket items. The unemployment rate rose to 8.1 percent in February, the highest level in 25 years. Falling sales lifted the inventory-to-sales ratio, a measure of how long it would take to sell stockpiles of goods at the current sales pace, to 1.30 months' worth -- the highest since a matching reading in January 2002 -- from December's 1.27 months. "Lumber and metals inventories-to-sales ratios have reached uncomfortably high levels. The lack of building activity has been a substantial negative for these sectors, and will continue to weigh in coming quarters," Whelan said. (Editing by  Jan Paschal )
