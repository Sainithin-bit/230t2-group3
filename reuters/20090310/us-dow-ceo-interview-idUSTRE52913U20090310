 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Dow Chemical will not be pressured into a fire sale of strategic assets, given the new structure of the Rohm and Haas deal and the settlement of the merger dispute between the two U.S. chemical makers, Dow Chemical Chief Executive Andrew Liveris said on Monday. 

 "We've designed a structure where we can control our own destiny, rather than be forced to fire-sale. And this new structure gives us the flexibility that we didn't have before," Liveris said in an interview. "More critically, we can retain very key assets like Dow AgroSciences and Dow Corning," said Liveris, while adding that Dow may still consider selling a stake in its Dow AgroSciences business, if there are some strategic benefits from the deal. Dow Chemical and Rohm and Haas Co had been scheduled to face off in Delaware Chancery Court on Monday, as Rohm and Haas sued Dow in January for failing to close the $15.3 billion deal on schedule. Dow had claimed that the deal in its original form would jeopardize the future of the combined entity. The two sides reached a settlement on Monday after Rohm's two largest shareholders -- the Haas Family Trusts and Paulson & Co -- agreed to take a sizable preferred equity stake in Dow. Dow's deal to buy Rohm and Haas was derailed after its Kuwaiti partners backed out of a $17.4 billion joint venture. Dow had intended to use the proceeds from this venture to fund the Rohm deal. Liveris said even though Petrochemical Industries Co backed out of the deal, the Kuwaiti company is still interested in Dow's basic plastics assets and was forced out of the deal mainly due to political reasons. Kuwaiti legislators terminated the joint venture agreement due to concerns that the project would not be economically viable in light of the global financial crisis and the slump in worldwide petrochemical sales. "We are being very patient with our partner and are still talking to them and there is a chance somewhere out there that these discussions could possibly take flight again," said Liveris. However, Dow is also talking to other parties that are interested in partnering with it in basic plastics business. "At this moment in the petrochemical cycle it would not be right to fire-sale this business, as it is too good an asset," said Liveris. "If we can re-create the strategic aspect of the Kuwait deal, in other words an oil and gas company -- somebody who can give us access to hydrocarbon resources -- then we would do a transaction," said Liveris. "But, right now because we've bought flexibility with this new structure for Rohm and Haas ... we are in no hurry to make this deal happen." (Reporting by Euan Rocha; Editing by  Gary Hill )
