 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stock markets could reach a long-term bottom either in 2010 or around 2016 once the massive debt bubble that caused the global financial crisis has completely popped, a well known market forecaster said this week. 

 "I have two time periods where I think we are likely to get a cyclical bottom. One of them is late 2010," Robert Prechter, chief executive at research company Elliott Wave International in Gainesville, Georgia, told Reuters Insider in a television interview on Monday. Prechter, who forecast the 1987 stock market crash, reiterated his call made in February that the S&P 500 index .SPX  will likely hit an intermediate term bottom "somewhere in the 600s" and a "substantial" bear market rally will ensue. On Tuesday, the S&P 500 index gained more than 4 percent, rising above 700 points and off recent 12-year lows partly on optimism about the battered banking sector. "Once the rally gets going I think people are going to return greatly to that old feeling that everything is fine and the bear market is over," Prechter said. But investors' more positive sentiment will ultimately fade and the stock market will resume its descent, Prechter said. The second likely time period when U.S. stocks might hit a long-term bottom, is "somewhere out 2016, plus or minus a couple of years, (which) looks to me to be about how long it will take to unwind the tremendous credit bubble that got created," Prechter said. On February 27 in a telephone interview with Reuters, Prechter said he expected the equities bear market had several years left to run and that ultimately stock prices could fall by half from late February levels. On February 27, the S&P 500 fell to a multi-year low around 735 points. (Reporting by  John Parry ; Editing by  Neil Stempleman )
