 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Global miner BHP Billiton will continue to build its Canadian potash business despite Ottawa blocking its $39 billion bid for the nation's largest producer, Potash Corp, this week. 

 Here are some questions and answers about BHP's ambition to become a major supplier of fertilizer to an increasingly crowded world where better crop yields are the key to survival. WILL BHP PERSIST IN BUILDING A CANADIAN POTASH BUSINESS? Probably. BHP Chief Executive Marius Kloppers has committed to spend billions of dollars on developing the company's Jansen project in Saskatchewan, whatever the outcome of its Potash Corp offer. Saskatchewan province is favored for its abundant potash reserves, which are typically easy to mine, consistent over large areas and cost less to exploit than deposits in other countries. BHP has already invested $400 million in Jansen, which is expected to start producing potash by 2015, ultimately at an annual rate of 8 million metric tons, according to Kloppers. However, Canadian court documents show BHP will not make a final investment decision on Jansen until next year. WHY DOESN'T BHP LOOK ELSEWHERE FOR POTASH ASSETS? Canada offers the most attractive investment potential among the world's three major potash basins -- Canada, Belarus and Russia. Potash deposits in Belarus and Russia are more complex and costly to mine. Belarus and Russia are also seen as difficult to break into for new potash entrants. Uralkali and Silvinit, Russia's top two potash firms, are currently being merged by potash tycoon Suleiman Kerimov, prompting speculation that Russia is trying to create a national potash champion, possibly involving privately owned Belaruskali and Russia's No. 3 Phosagro. WHAT DOES BHP'S FAILURE MEAN FOR POTASH PRICES? If BHP had clinched Potash Corp, the miner would have changed marketing and production practices in Canada's potash industry, probably weighing down prices, at least in the short term. The current industry practice -- followed by the Canpotex marketing consortium -- is to link production rates to prices, assuring high returns for its three members: Potash Corp, Mosaic Co and Agrium Inc. BHP has shown it is anti-cartel in all the commodities markets that it operates in. The rejection of its Potash Corp bid means North American producers of the crop nutrient will avoid a shake-up in their marketing cartel. With the status quo intact, fertilizer retailers and farmers are stuck with a pricing system they say is rigged against them. HOW DEEP ARE BHP'S ROOTS IN THE CANADIAN POTASH SECTOR? BHP first formed a joint venture with Canada's Anglo Potash Ltd in 2006 to evaluate the potential to develop the Jansen deposit. Anglo Potash had previously spent two years acquiring potash permits covering about 1.8 million acres in Saskatchewan. In July 2008, BHP paid $280 million to buy out Anglo Potash. In January it paid $320 million for neighboring Athabasca Potash, increasing its exploration ground. (Editing by  Lincoln Feast )
