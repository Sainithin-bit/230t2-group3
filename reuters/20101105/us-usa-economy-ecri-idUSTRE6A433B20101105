 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A measure of future U.S. economic growth rose to a 4-week high in the latest week, while the index's annualized growth rate held steady, a research group said on Friday. 

 The Economic Cycle Research Institute, a New York-based independent forecasting group, said its Weekly Leading Index rose to 123.2 in the week ending October 29 from 123.0 the previous week. That was the highest level since October 1, when it stood at 123.7. The index's annualized growth rate was minus 6.5 percent, the same rate as a week earlier. Last week's growth rate marked a 19-week high, the highest since June 11, when it was minus 6.1 percent. (Reporting by  Edith Honan ; Editing by  Chizu Nomiyama )
