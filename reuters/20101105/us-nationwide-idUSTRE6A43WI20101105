 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Insurer and financial services provider Nationwide Mutual NMUIC.UL increased profits in the first nine months of the year, as lower claims and higher demand for savings and retirement products offset economic woes. 

 Privately held Nationwide said operating income, excluding gains and losses, rose 39 percent to $975 million for the nine months ended September 30. Net income rose just more than 5 percent to $569 million. Nationwide said variable annuity sales rose 28 percent, fixed life insurance sales rose 146 percent and retention of existing customers increased as well. The company also said deposits and the loan book grew at its Nationwide Bank subsidiary. Operating income in the company's property and casualty unit more than doubled to $630 million on lower claims, though earned premiums fell 5 percent on a weak economic climate and a tighter focus on risk. "We are seeing some of those pressures in the personal lines ... both from a pricing standpoint as well as it's competitive out there," Nationwide Chief Financial Officer Mark Thresher said in an interview. Thresher said the company's financial services businesses are performing well as the company gets closer to year-end and that it is seeing some "positive trends" in personal lines.
