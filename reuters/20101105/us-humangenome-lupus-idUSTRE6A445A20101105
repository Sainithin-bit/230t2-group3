 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Biotech company Human Genome Sciences Inc HGSI.O stands on the verge of blockbuster success with a new drug for a debilitating disease that has frustrated researchers for decades. 

 Benlysta is expected to become the first medicine approved for fighting the autoimmune disease lupus in a half-century. Positive study results last year sparked a flood of interest from investors and patients, and U.S. regulators now are weighing whether to grant marketing approval. Wall Street expects the drug to get a green light later this year or early next year, particularly since current lupus therapies are limited and can produce serious side effects. "Given the paucity of treatments out there for lupus right now, that's one big factor in favor of this drug," said Morningstar analyst Meera Venu, who predicts a 70 percent chance of approval. The drug's annual sales may hit $2.2 billion globally in 2014, according to Thomson Reuters consensus forecasts. Some analysts predict peak sales as high as $3 billion to $4 billion a year, which Human Genome will split with partner GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK.N ) ( GSK.L ). That would put the medicine in league with biotech's major successes and move Human Genome from an unprofitable company to an industry star. First, Benlysta must pass scrutiny from regulators. A preliminary Food and Drug Administration review is due for release next Friday ahead of a November 16 advisory panel meeting where outside experts will provide input. The FDA is due to deliver a final ruling by December 9. Regulators will consider how well the drug helped patients with lupus, which causes the immune system to attack the body's own tissue and organs, leading to arthritis, kidney damage, chest pain, fatigue, skin rash and other problems. In company-funded studies, more patients given Benlysta saw an improvement in symptoms compared with current standard care, which typically includes immunosuppressant drugs such as Roche's ( ROG.VX ) CellCept and steroids such as prednisone. One of two positive studies showed 43 percent of patients given a high Benlysta dose with standard therapies felt relief and no disease worsening in various organs after one year of treatment. That compared with nearly 34 percent with a placebo and standard care. Data made public so far offer a strong case for the drug, analysts say, although there is always a chance the FDA or the panel could focus on an unknown or little-noted issue. Benlysta, known generically as belimumab, is given once a month by intravenous infusion. The drug is designed to inhibit BLyS, a protein in the body that exists to keep B-cells functioning normally. B-cells make antibodies that prevent infection. In lupus patients, B-cells are overstimulated and make antibodies that attack the body. EXPLOSIVE SHARE GROWTH Human Genome shares may be volatile when the FDA's initial review goes public because the agency often highlights areas for debate, analysts said. The FDA may want the advisory panel's input on a small excess number of cancers reported in Benlysta patients or questions about how long treatment should last, they said. A final FDA ruling could stretch beyond December as the agency may need more time to consider the panel's input, analysts said. Approval is "almost certain by 2011, but the possibility of some administrative delay should not be ignored," Sanford Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a research note. Porges and some other analysts see more upside for Human Genome shares despite a massive run-up from less than 50 cents in March 2009, before the first encouraging Benlysta findings were released, to around $26 on Friday. Porges has a $32 price target on the shares. Analysts expect the drug will cost between $15,000 and $30,000 per patient a year, a price tag in line with biotech medicines for other autoimmune diseases. An estimated 5 million people worldwide have the disease, and many cannot find relief with current drugs or suffer harsh side effects such as severe bone loss from steroids. Hopes for effective and safer alternatives were raised, and dashed, in recent years when several companies failed in attempts to develop new treatments. "There is really a more-than-urgent need for safe, effective, tolerable treatments of lupus. We have had many failures in the past," said Sandra Raymond, president of the Lupus Foundation of America. Positive findings for Benlysta have created a buzz among patients. Many are lining up to speak at the FDA's public meeting to urge approval. One of them is Janice Fitzgibbon, a 54-year-old lupus patient who took part in the Benlysta trials. She has been treated with the drug for at least six months and possibly longer as she hasn't been told if she got Benlysta or a placebo during the study's original phase. Before the trial, Fitzgibbon said she had episodes of crushing fatigue and other symptoms that sharply curtailed her life. After joining the study, "I went from half-dead to totally alive," she said. Stories like these are generating excitement among patients. Still, Benlysta will not help for everyone and long-term side effects for a drug that could be taken for years remain unknown. The company plans initially to target about 200,000 U.S. patients with moderate to severe lupus. "It's not going to work for every single person with lupus. We need an arsenal of medicines to treat this very diverse disease," Raymond said. (Reporting by Lisa Richwine; Editing by  Tim Dobbyn )
