 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Chinese telecom-equipment makers Huawei Technologies Co Ltd HWT.UL and ZTE Corp ( 0763.HK ) ( 000063.SZ ) have been kept out of a large Sprint Nextel Corp ( S.N ) contract over U.S. national security concerns, the Wall Street Journal reported on its website on Friday. 

 U.S. officials are worried about the companies' ties to the Chinese government and military, the paper said. Commerce Secretary Gary Locke called Sprint Chief Executive Dan Hesse this week, but did not ask the company to exclude the Chinese, the paper said. The bids submitted by Huawei and ZTE were lower than those by Alcatel-Lucent SA ( ALUA.PA ), Telefonaktiebolaget L M Ericsson ( ERICb.ST ) and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd ( 005930.KS ), the Journal reported. Samsung and Alcatel-Lucent are the finalists, it said. Sprint declined to comment.
