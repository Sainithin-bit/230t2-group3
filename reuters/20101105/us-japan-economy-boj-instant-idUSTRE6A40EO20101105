 TOKYO  (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan kept interest rates at zero and held off on easing monetary policy after Federal Reserve's bond buying plan failed to trigger yen gains sharp enough to warrant an immediate policy response. 

 The BOJ outlined details of its buying of exchange-traded funds (ETF) and real estate trust funds (REIT) under its asset buying programme. ************************************************************** KEY POINTS: -- As widely expected, the BOJ kept interest rates on hold in a range of zero to 0.1 percent by a unanimous vote. -- The central bank said it would buy ETF linked to the Topix  .TOPX  and the Nikkei average  .N225 , and buy REITs with a rating of AA or higher. -- It will begin buying government bonds under its new 5 trillion yen ($62 billion) asset-buying scheme at the beginning of next week, followed by purchases of other assets. -- Governor Shirakawa will hold a news conference with his embargoed comments expected out around 4:15 p.m. (0715 GMT). COMMENTARY: AYAKO SERA, STRATEGIST, SUMITOMO TRUST BANK, TOKYO "There's still a risk of further easing this year, if stocks fall on the strengthening yen and deflationary pressures mount. Then the BOJ will likely take steps against deflation. "It will be easier for the BOJ to ease monetary policy than take action in the currency market, in terms of external explanations. "For the BOJ's next step, the most likely would be to expand the 5 trillion yen asset-buying fund, primarily by boosting the amount of JGBs it buys. "The Japanese economy is likely heading for contraction in the fourth quarter, raising the prospect for a downward revision to GDP." HIROKATA KUSABA, SENIOR ECONOMIST, MIZUHO RESEARCH INSTITUTE, TOKYO "Today's decision was largely as expected so no surprise here. The yen's moves following the FOMC meeting kept the BOJ from embarking on contingency plans. "The BOJ will have to keep watch on Fed moves ahead as market players expect an 'easing race' between the two. "The Fed may come under pressure for further easing toward the end of this year or early next if economic indicators underscore the weakness of the U.S. economy. That would weaken the dollar and force the BOJ to follow suit. "Japanese economic indicators will also be weak in the coming months, and the BOJ may ease policy further -- possibly by doubling the amount of its 5 trillion yen asset-buying fund -- as early as in December if its tankan survey turns out worse than expected." YOSHIKIYO SHIMAMINE, CHIEF ECONOMIST, DAI-ICHI LIFE RESEARCH INSTITUTE, TOKYO "The BOJ's decision to do nothing extra this time was what the market expected, but it showed that the BOJ 's stance is a 'defense-only' policy. "I think the decision disappointed the market. The yen gained against the dollar. "If the market moves drastically by the time of the next policy meeting next month, the BOJ may hold an extraordinary meeting. But I don't think we can expect anything aggressive." SUSUMU KATO, CHIEF ECONOMIST, CREDIT AGRICOLE, TOKYO "What has been announced is not enough compared to the U.S. central bank's expansion of easing steps, and the BOJ needs to implement measures to increase liquidity. "The BOJ needs to further expand its easing measures to beat deflation and prevent the yen from appreciating further. It is expected to do so in the next few months. The effective step will be to increase the amount of outright JGB purchasing. "I don't rule out the possibility that the BOJ will hold an emergency meeting within this year, depending on the yen's moves." NAOMI HASEGAWA, SENIOR STRATEGIST, MITSUBISHI UFJ MORGAN STANLEY SECURITIES, JAPAN "As share prices had been rising both at home and abroad, the market was not expecting any fresh measures. So in that sense there was no real surprise. "The BOJ seems to be downgrading its economic assessment from last month, bring its forecast more in line with the market consensus. The BOJ may expand its asset purchases if the economic outlook deteriorates further. "On its buying of ETFs, the BOJ appears to be trying not to distort markets. But by buying ETFs quietly through trust banks, the BOJ will be giving up 'shock and awe' effects on markets. That could eventually lead to pressure to buy more assets." MARKET REACTION: -- The yen edged higher after the BOJ decision, with the dollar dipping about 20 pips to 80.70 yen down 0.1% on the day. The euro slipped about 40 pips to 114.59 yen, down 0.1% from late New York. BACKGROUND: -- The BOJ last month surprised markets by pegging rates virtually at zero and pledging to pump more money into the economy with a 5 trillion yen ($61.94 billion) asset buying scheme that targets government bonds and corporate debt. -- It pushed forward its November rate review to this week from later this month to speed up the launch of the asset buying scheme, and has said it will announce details of its buying of exchange-traded funds and real estate investment trusts. -- The rescheduled BOJ meeting came a day after the Federal Reserve decided on a controversial new policy of committing to buy government bonds to help an anemic U.S. economy.
