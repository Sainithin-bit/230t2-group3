 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of Clearwire Corp CLWR.O fell more than 10 percent on Friday on concerns its cutback plans would hurt growth and worries about whether it would secure the financing it needs to expand its network. 

 Several Analysts downgraded the stock after Clearwire said it would cut jobs and suspend some growth initiatives in a bid to save up to $400 million due to uncertainty over whether it would be able to raise new funding. RBC analyst Jonathan Atkin said in a research note that he downgraded the stock to sector perform from outperform, citing uncertainty about funding and the cash conservation efforts, which he said "will detract near term from the company's appeal as a growth play within wireless." Wells Fargo analyst Jennifer Fritzsche said Clearwire's spending cuts, which include suspending of retail market launches, "could be disruptive to its near term momentum." Many analysts say they expect Clearwire, which is majority-owned by Sprint Nextel ( S.N ), to come up with funding in time, but some said they were nervous about the increasingly apparent complexity of its relationship with Sprint, which rents space on Clearwire's network to offer its own mobile data services. Clearwire also noted on in its earnings release issued late on Thursday that it was working through a dispute about wholesale pricing that shaved about $17 million off the revenue it was able to recognize for the quarter. It had said that the dispute related to differing interpretations between Clearwire and its wholesale partners about what rates they should pay. Mizuho analyst Michael Nelson said he expects Clearwire to raise a total of $4 billion in new funding in the coming years, including $1 billion in 2011, another $2 billion in 2012 and $1 billion by 2014. "We expect an overhang to remain on Clearwire until the company completes a capital raise," he said. Clearwire shares were down 77 cents at $6.40 on Nasdaq.
