 TORONTO  (Reuters) - Canada's Competition Bureau has decided not to challenge BHP Billiton's $39 billion hostile bid to acquire Potash Corp, BHP said on Friday. 

 But this tacit clearance would be moot unless the Anglo-Australian miner were able to win a separate approval from the Canadian government. Earlier this week, Canada's Industry Minister Tony Clement said the government had decided to block the bid for the world's largest fertilizer maker, as a takeover did not offer a "net benefit" to Canada -- a precondition under Canadian law. The Competition Bureau review is an entirely separate process, which examines whether a takeover runs afoul of Canadian antitrust laws. As BHP has no potash operations in production anywhere in the world, this review was not expected to pose a big hurdle to the world's top miner. BHP has said its $130-a-share tender offer is still going forward and it is continuing to work on trying to persuade the Canadian government to approve this transaction.
