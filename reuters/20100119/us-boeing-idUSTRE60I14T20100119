 PARIS  (Reuters) - Boeing is happy with the progress of testing on its 787 Dreamliner, Yves Galland, President of Boeing France, said on Tuesday. 

 "We are extremely satisfied with the results of these tests. At this stage we have nothing to worry about -- quite the contrary in fact," he told a press briefing in France. Boeing has carried out 15 test flights of the lightweight, fuel-saving passenger aircraft lasting a total of some 60 hours from its Seattle commercial aircraft base. The 787 staged a long-delayed maiden flight in December. Boeing said on Friday it had so far completed initial stall tests and other dynamic maneuvers and carried out an extensive check-out of the airplane's systems. It said the plane had reached its initial airworthiness milestone, allowing the company to expand testing. First delivery is due in the fourth quarter.
