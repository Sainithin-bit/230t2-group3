 (Reuters) - Kraft Foods ramped up its bid for Cadbury Plc to 11.9 billion pounds ($19.6 billion) on Tuesday, securing the backing of the British confectioner's board after a four-month stand-off between the two companies. 

 Following are key facts about Cadbury: * Cadbury is the world's second-largest confectionery company after Mars-Wrigley, making brands such as Dairy Milk chocolate, Trident gum and Halls cough drops. * Cadbury has the No. 1 or No. 2 positions in more than 20 of the world's 50 biggest confectionery markets. * Cadbury operates in more than 60 countries and employs more than 46,000 people. * Full-year revenue in 2008 came to 5.38 billion pounds with underlying operating profit of 638 million pounds. The company has said unaudited figures showed 2009 revenue rose 11 percent, helped by currency movements. * HISTORY: * Started life in 1824 with John Cadbury opening a shop in Birmingham selling tea and cocoa. * Merged with Schweppes in 1969 to create Cadbury Schweppes. * Became the world's biggest confectionery group in 2003 after buying the U.S. Adams chewing gum business for $4.2 billion. * Sold continental European business to Lion and Blackstone for 1.85 billion euros in February 2006. * Demerged Cadbury Schweppes in May 2008 following shareholder pressure, creating the London-listed confectionery group Cadbury Plc and U.S. soft drinks group Dr Pepper Snapple Group. * In March 2009, sold Australian beverage business Schweppes Australia to Asahi Breweries for A$1.185 billion, completing its exit from soft drinks. * In January 2010 Kraft Foods Inc sweetened its cash and stock offer for Cadbury with more cash, as the U.S. food company's hostile takeover attempt entered its final month. * Hershey authorized drawing up a bid for Cadbury and a formal offer could be made within two weeks, the Financial Times reported on Thursday, citing a person familiar with the matter. Hershey has until January 23 to make a bid under British Takeover Panel rules. (Editing by  Andrew Callus ; Additional writing by David Cutler, London Editorial Reference Unit)
