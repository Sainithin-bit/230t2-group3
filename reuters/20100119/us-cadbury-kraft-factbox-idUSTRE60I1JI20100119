 (Reuters) - Kraft Foods ramped up its bid for Cadbury Plc on Tuesday, securing the backing of the British confectioner's board after a four-month stand-off between the two companies. 

 Following are facts about Kraft: * Kraft is the world's second-largest food group, after Nestle. * The company's origins date to 1903, when James L. Kraft began a business selling cheese from the back of a wagon in Chicago, Illinois. In 1914 the company started making its own cheese. * Kraft was acquired by tobacco corporation Philip Morris in 1988 for $12.9 billion. * In 2000, Philip Morris bought Nabisco, the maker of Oreo cookies, for $19.2 billion, and merged it with Kraft. * Kraft Foods Inc was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 2001, with the spin-off completed in 2007. * In 2007, Kraft bought the cookie business of Danone -- which includes well-known French brand LU -- for $7.2 billion. When the bid was announced, French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde is reported to have said: "We are not yet ready to put ketchup on our petits LU." * Kraft still sells cheese singles under the Kraft brand in some countries, including Britain, while in North America the Kraft brand adorns packets of macaroni and cheese. * Kraft's other major brands include Oscar Mayer hot dogs, Maxwell House instant coffee, Philadelphia cream cheese and chocolate brands Milka and Toblerone, acquired when it bought Jacobs Suchard in 1990. * Kraft has 98,000 employees and 168 plants. * Kraft had revenue of $42 billion in 2008.
