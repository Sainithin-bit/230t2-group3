 BOSTON/LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - IBM Corp on Tuesday raised its profit target for 2010 and reported higher fourth-quarter earnings, as cost cuts and a shift to more profitable contracts helped the world's leading technology services company weather a slump in corporate spending. 

 COMMENTARY: TED PARRISH, CO-PORTFOLIO MANAGER, HENSSLER EQUITY FUND "Their numbers were solid -- to beat on the top and bottom lines is pretty impressive. All in all, it looks like a good quarter, it looks like business is holding up. The numbers actually justified the (share price) runup to the earnings call. "I'm a long-term investor in IBM. While I think the long-term prospects for the company are good, I think the shares are a bit frothy, not overvalued but I would say the stock isn't going to do as well as it did in 2009. "A long-term investor would do well by holding them -- single digit gains." PETER MISEK, ANALYST, CANACCORD ADAMS "There is far more for the global economy to go and there is a significant amount of acceleration that is going on in the global economy, and IBM will be a beneficiary of that." STEPHEN MASSOCCA, MANAGING DIRECTOR, WEDBUSH MORGAN "There were some pretty big expectations built in, and you really needed to wow it. "Obviously there were a lot of whispers out there that it would be an even bigger beat." KIM CAUGHEY, SENIOR ANALYST, FORT PITT CAPITAL GROUP "Even though revenues were really strong, which I think is depressing the stock price right now, it doesn't look like a super-strong quarter relative to last year. The company is down last year in constant currency. If there is a cloud, that is the cloud. "The silver lining, the company is in control of its expenses. It has controlled those very well, and it shows in the gross profit margin at a whopping 48.3 percent this quarter." Fort Pitt Capital Group holds IBM shares. ANDY MIEDLER, ANALYST, EDWARD JONES "This was a very solid quarter. IBM is just a machine throughout the downturn, they have provided consistent results and this is no different. The shares are trading down slightly on, 'buy the rumor, sell the news.' We believe shares are still attractively priced. "The outlook for 2010 is positive. I think investors were already expecting a slightly raised outlook. We think there is still plenty of room for upside. Now IBM shares are trading at only 12 times (forward earnings) estimates. For a company that executes as consistently and has as solid a long-term earnings prospect as IBM, we think there is plenty of room for shares to move higher." LOU MISCIOSCIA, ANALYST, BRIGANTINE ADVISORS "IBM took up the high end of its prior 2010 target to 'at least $11 per share.' Our current estimate for next year is $11.10 per share. We view that as being conservative, because we believe that technology spending is starting to improve broadly. "Services signings of $18.8 billion beat our number by about $1 billion. That's a nice number. He said he was not surprised that the stock traded down on the results. "A bit of a selloff, even a couple of points, would not be unexpected, only because of today's rally."
