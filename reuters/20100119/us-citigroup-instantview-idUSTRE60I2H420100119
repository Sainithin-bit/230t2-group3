 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc posted a $7.6 billion fourth-quarter loss after taking charges linked to repaying government funds. 

 The third-largest U.S. bank said the loss amounted to 33 cents a share, compared with a loss of $17.3 billion, or $3.40 a share, in the same quarter a year earlier. The per-share loss matched analysts' forecasts. Citigroup shares were down 1.5 percent in premarket electronic trading. The following is reaction from industry analysts and investors: TIM GHRISKEY, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, SOLARIS ASSET MANAGEMENT, BEDFORD HILLS, NEW YORK "The results are somewhat mixed and hard to decipher, especially given the TARP payback and lots of moving parts in terms of reserves. In general...it looks like it was ok. There was improvement in loan losses and certainly their capital base seems solid here and that's important..." "The income -- it is just very hard to really tell what is going on but it seems as if it's more or less in-line with expectations and perhaps revenue is a little bit light." RICK MECKLER, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, LIBERTYVIEW CAPITAL MANAGEMENT IN NEW YORK "I don't think there are any huge surprises for the market. I don't think there's anything that should have changed people's views of the company. I think that part of the problem is that there is an expectation among financial companies that numbers have to beat at this point in the cycle in order to be good and I think following JP Morgan's numbers, Citi's numbers just reflect a weak environment but otherwise improving fundamentals. "I think JPMorgan already showed -- and Citi confirmed -- that the banking sector is probably out of the woods and there is going to have to be a continued focus on improving the employment picture and general credit conditions." WALTER TODD, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, GREENWOOD CAPITAL ASSOCIATES, GREENWOOD, SOUTH CAROLINA: "I'm not sure what would make me want to invest in Citigroup, but this certainly doesn't." "If you are telling me that Ken Lewis had to go at Bank of America, I don't see what the argument is that Vikram Pandit shouldn't be sharing the door at Citigroup. It isn't like they have turned the ship around." GARY TOWNSEND, CHIEF EXECUTIVE, HILL-TOWNSEND CAPITAL IN CHEVY CHASE, MARYLAND "The issues remain the same: When does credit finally begin to repair itself at Citi? The evidence is that there's still more work to do. Credit is under repair and the banks are working hard at it but the economy is still weak and until we see a turn in the economy we're unlikely to see an appreciable uptick in credit, beyond expectations. "The banks are getting their bad credits behind them through the usual ways -- foreclosure, writing off loans -- and at some point in the next quarter or two we are going to see a credit turn. It's just not going to be this quarter. I think it's probably going to be evident in the first quarter reports and more manifestly in the second quarter." MATT MCCORMICK, PORTFOLIO MANAGER AND BANKING ANALYST, BAHL & GAYNOR INVESTMENT COUNSEL IN CINCINNATI, OHIO "This is a noisy quarter." "It's not an impressive quarter in my view. Comps were good, comparable to last year, but I think still some people were expecting a better quarter. Is it positive? Sure, but I think a lot of people are still concerned about what's going to happen in terms of the bank tax, the financial overhaul bill...It seems investors are starting to pull away from some of these shares, they're booking 2009 profits." "You've got to give Pandit credit for keeping the ball in play... right now the sentiment on Citigroup and most of the banks is that prior to JPMorgan's release people were expecting a rosier outlook and they're getting mostly in-line estimates and continued caution and that seems to be the outlook that will weigh on shares going forward."
