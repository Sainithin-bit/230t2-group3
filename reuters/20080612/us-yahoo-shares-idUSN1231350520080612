 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Yahoo shares sank on Thursday to their lowest since before Microsoft announced its takeover offer for the company. 

 The 12 percent plunge in the stock followed Yahoo's announcement that the latest round of talks with Microsoft had ended with no deal. The stock last traded at $23.07, down $3.08 on the session. The stock briefly fell to as low as $22.50. That is the lowest the stock has traded since January 31, the day before Microsoft made public its initial takeover offer at $31 per share.
