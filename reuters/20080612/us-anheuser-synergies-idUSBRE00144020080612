 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - It is premature to talk about synergies from InBev's INTB.BR proposed takeover of Anheuser-Busch ( BUD.N ), InBev CEO Carlos Brito said on Thursday. 

 InBev said it was not ready to disclose which non-core assets it could sell to finance the deal, adding that new debt was likely to be based in the United States for tax reasons. "At this stage it's a bit premature to discuss the target with synergies," Brito told a webcast conference for analysts. "These synergies would get us to meet our internal financial benchmarks for an acquisition," he added. Belgium-based InBev, formed by the 2004 merger of Belgium's Interbrew with Brazil's AmBev, made on Wednesday an unsolicited $46.3 billion bid to buy Anheuser-Busch Cos and create the world's largest brewer.
