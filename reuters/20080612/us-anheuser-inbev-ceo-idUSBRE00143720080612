 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - The chief executive of InBev said on Thursday there was a very strong rationale for his company's $46.3 billion bid to buy U.S. rival Anheuser-Busch Cos Inc to create the world's largest brewer. 

 "The business rationale is very strong," Carlos Brito said in a video statement posted on InBev's website ( here ). Belgium-based InBev, formed by the 2004 merger of Belgium's Interbrew with Brazil's AmBev, announced on Wednesday the biggest ever takeover of an alcoholic drinks company.
