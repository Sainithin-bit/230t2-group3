 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc said on Thursday it does not expect any material changes from its prior forecast when it reports quarterly results on June 16, even after replacing its chief financial officer and chief operating officer. 

 Lehman said it closed the sale of $4 billion in common stock and $2 billion in convertibles. That offering came after Lehman said Monday it expects to post a roughly $2.8 billion quarterly loss. In a statement, Lehman said it does not expect to disclose any material changes from the preliminary results. (Reporting by  Dan Wilchins ; editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)
