 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Philadelphia Federal Reserve President Charles Plosser said on Thursday current U.S. interest rates are supportive for growth, but the Fed needs to stay vigilant in keeping inflation expectations contained. 

 "Monetary policy is quite accommodative right now," Plosser told CNBC television. "Inflation is on everybody's mind...We have to take appropriate steps to do something about that." (Reporting by  Richard Leong , Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
