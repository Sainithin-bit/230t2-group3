 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Former Refco Inc Chief Executive Phillip Bennett deserves a long prison term when he is sentenced for fraud after presiding over "a conspiracy of historic proportions," U.S. prosecutors argued in court papers made public on Thursday. 

 Bennett pleaded guilty in February -- a month before he was set to go on trial -- to 20 counts of fraud and other charges stemming from the 2005 collapse of the futures and commodities broker. He faces a maximum of 315 years in prison at sentencing, set for July 3 in Manhattan federal court. The date was rescheduled from an earlier date of June 19. The government "respectfully submits that given the duration and intensity of the fraud, Bennett should receive no leniency," prosecutors wrote in a sentencing memorandum to U.S. District Judge Naomi Buchwald. Bennett "stood on top of a conspiracy of historic proportions, defrauding his victims of billions of dollars based on a series of lies that covered more than eight years of fraudulent activity, and which made him a billionaire prior to the discovery of the fraud," prosecutors wrote in the court papers, dated June 6 but made public on Thursday. Refco and 23 affiliates filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in October 2005, a week after revealing that Bennett had hidden $430 million of bad customer debt. It later liquidated its operations. Prosecutors wrote that while Bennett had attempted to portray himself "as a man of modest tastes who enjoyed nothing more extravagant than an afternoon in his garden chasing geese," the one-time Refco chief was motivated by greed. Among other things, Bennett indulged in a sprawling mansion in New Jersey, a penthouse apartment in Manhattan, a $20 million plane and a car collection of 15 sports and racing cars worth more than $11 million, prosecutors wrote. Bennett, in his guilty plea, admitted to concealing the fraud from Refco's auditors, investors, buyout firm Thomas H. Lee Partners, which bought a majority interest in Refco through a $1.9 billion leveraged buyout in August 2004, and others. In separate court papers, also made public on Thursday, his lawyers recommended that the judge impose a sentence "for a term of years well short of the remainder of Mr. Bennett's life." His lawyers argued that Bennett, a 60-year-old British citizen, has accepted responsibility for his actions, pleaded guilty and has cooperated with plaintiffs in civil lawsuits stemming from Refco's demise. An attorney for Bennett, Gary Naftalis, was not immediately available for further comment. The Refco case drew comparisons to the furor over a massive accounting fraud that drove giant telecommunications company WorldCom Inc into bankruptcy, among other financial scandals. Prosecutors wrote in the court papers that they believe Bennett deserves "an appropriately stiff term of imprisonment, consistent with the sentences imposed" in other major corporate fraud cases, such as the Adelphia and WorldCom accounting fraud scandals. Adelphia founder John Rigas is currently serving a 15-year prison term, while his son, Timothy, is serving 20 years. Former WorldCom chief Bernard Ebbers is serving 25 years in prison.
