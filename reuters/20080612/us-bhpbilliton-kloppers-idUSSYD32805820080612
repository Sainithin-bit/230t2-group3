 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - BHP Billiton Ltd/Plc ( BHP.AX ) ( BLT.L ) on Thursday took its case for a takeover of rival Rio Tinto Ltd/Plc ( RIO.AX ) ( RIO.L ) to well-heeled investors on Thursday, saying a marriage could better capture markets in fast-industrializing Asian economies. 

 Chief Executive Marius Kloppers told 400 high net worth clients of UBS at a meeting in Sydney that the around $170 billion takeover of Rio would see the merged entity control 20 percent of China's iron ore market and make it a bigger force in coal, copper and other commodities sought after in China. "The twenty-first century will be the Asian century. BHP really finds itself at the coal-face of this event," Kloppers said. China already takes half of all the iron ore BHP mines, but balances this with orders from Rio, as well as Brazil's CVRD ( VALE5.SA ) ( RIO.N ) and smaller miners in India and elsewhere. China's steel making industry, the world's biggest, routinely battles BHP over freight rates for iron ore during annual price negotiations. Kloppers has applied similar reasoning to promote the merger among large institutions that hold about 70 percent of BHP's shares. Kloppers said BHP expected to post offer documents to Rio Tinto shareholders by the end of the year pending approvals from anti-trust agencies in the European Union and elsewhere. Rio has rejected the offer of 3.4 BHP shares for each Rio share as too cheap. (Reporting by  James Regan )
