 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Investors are buying Lehman Brothers LEH.N bonds even as the stock tanks, betting that even in the worst-case scenario of the investment bank going out of business or being taken over for a pittance, bondholders will be paid back as they were for Bear Stearns. 

 The trade, which is also taking place in the credit derivatives market, helps explain one of the central questions in markets about Lehman: why are the bank's shares plummeting, suggesting a real loss of confidence in the bank, while the company's bonds more or less hold steady, which implies no loss of confidence at all? Dealers said some clients own Lehman shares and view the bonds as a good hedge against the company going out of business or being taken over. If the bank's fortunes improve, which shareholders hope for, the bonds will still likely improve. If the bank's fortunes deteriorate and the Federal Reserve arranges a Bear Stearns-style shotgun marriage, the acquirer will likely guarantee Lehman's bonds, and they will still improve. Bear Stearns faced a run on the bank in March and was taken over by JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ) in May for a fire sale price. Bear's bonds became JPMorgan Chase obligations. Lehman is seen by many investors as unlikely to fail. The Federal Reserve is offering financing to investment banks, which should prevent runs on the banks. And Lehman has just raised $6 billion of new capital, bringing the total equity and equity-linked capital it has raised since April to $10 billion. Still, Lehman's shares are dropping at an alarming rate, and some investors are betting that Lehman's troubles will continue. These investors are therefore selling the bank's shares short, and buying bonds. If the bank goes out of business or is taken over at a low price, both sides of the trade could profit. At least two strategists see this trade as reasonable for brokers in general, on the theory that brokers will need to dilute shareholders more by raising capital, while debtholders will generally be safe. "We have a very strong view where you want to be short with financial equities and long with debt for the bigger institutions, the brokers, the money center banks," said Greg Peters, head of global credit strategy at Morgan Stanley in New York. "That is a trade that we think is a secular trade." CreditSights, an independent research firm, is recommending the trade using equity options and credit derivatives on Lehman, Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) and Merrill Lynch & Co MER.N, among others. Lehman shares fell 4.4 percent on Thursday to $22.70, their lowest closing price since 2002. The shares have fallen 30 percent since Friday. Meanwhile, Lehman's bonds rose relative to Treasuries, bringing down the extra yield the bonds pay. The company's notes with a 6.75 percent coupon maturing in 2017 saw their yields spreads over Treasuries fall 0.06 percentage points to 3.54 percentage points, according to MarketAxess data.
