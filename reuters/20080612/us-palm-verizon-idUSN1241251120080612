 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Palm Inc PALM.O will sell its $99 Centro smartphone through Verizon Wireless ( VZ.N ), giving the smartphone maker access to Verizon's 67.2 million subscribers, The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday. 

 Palm said it had already sold more than 1 million Centros through Sprint Nextel Corp ( S.N ), which began selling the Centro last fall, AT&T Inc ( T.N ) and international carriers, according to the Journal. The Centro email-enabled mobile phone has been a strong seller for Palm, which has been struggling to keep its share of a smart phone market dominated by Research In Motion's Ltd's RIM.TO Blackberry and Apple's ( AAPL.O ) iPhone. Earlier this week, Apple unveiled its latest iPhone, which features a lower price tag that it hopes will further fuel its drive into the market. In its most recent quarterly results, Palm said the low-priced Centro was off to the strongest start of any smartphone in its history. That didn't stop it from reporting a quarterly loss on restructuring charges and other items. (Reporting by Christopher Kaufman; Editing by David Cowell)
