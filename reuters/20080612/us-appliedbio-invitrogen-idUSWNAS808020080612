 NEW YORK/BOSTON  (Reuters) - Invitrogen Corp IVGN.O plans to buy Applied Biosystems Inc ABI.N for $6.7 billion to form a top provider of research tools for the life sciences industry, the companies said on Thursday. 

 The purchase price of $38 per share in cash and stock represents a premium of 17 percent over Applied Biosystems' closing price on Wednesday and a premium of 12 percent over its average closing price in the past 30 days. Applied Biosystems sells big-ticket systems for laboratory research, such as gene-sequencing machines, while Invitrogen supplies the reagents used by many of those systems. The merged company would generate $3.5 billion in combined sales and offer a wide variety of products in areas such as genetic analysis, proteomics, cell biology and cell systems. "It makes sense in terms of their expertise in molecular biology, efficiencies in combined sales forces, overlap on product line and intellectual property interests," said Garp Research & Securities analyst Alastair Mackay. Such a combination was a source of speculation at a conference in Denver last week, he added. Invitrogen shares fell nearly 9 percent on news of the deal, while Applied Biosystems rose more than 6 percent. Shares of other research equipment companies Waters Corp ( WAT.N ) and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc ( TMO.N ) also rose more than 3 percent and more than 2 percent, respectively. The deal values Applied Biosystems at about 22 times estimated fiscal 2008 earnings, according to Reuters data. The 17 percent premium on the deal is lower than some recent acquisitions in the research tools and biotechnology areas. Deals in the tools area struck over the past five years had an average premium of 28 percent, according to Cowen & Co analyst Doug Schenkel, whose evaluation suggests Applied Biosystems could have drawn a valuation in the low $40 per share range. Recent acquisitions for companies making biotechnology medicines have been even more lofty, with an average premium of 63 percent, according to a report from Credit Suisse analysts. Tony White, chief executive of Applied Biosystems' parent company, Applera Corp, defended the premium, saying that because the deal comprises both cash and stock, Applied Biosystems shareholders will have the opportunity to participate in future value. "They are almost an equal partner in the upside of this transaction," White said in an interview. "If we were doing an all-cash deal we probably wouldn't have thought it was a good deal." Besides which, he said, many of the high-priced acquisitions in the biotech industry are "more sizzle than steak." COMBINED COMPANY On closing, Invitrogen shareholders would own a majority of the merged company, which would be named Applied Biosystems Inc and boast 3,000 sales representatives worldwide. The Invitrogen and Applied Biosystems brand names would be retained for their respective products. Greg Lucier, Invitrogen's chief executive, would be chief executive of the combined company, while Mark Stevenson, chief operating officer at Applied Biosystems, would become president and chief operating officer of the combined company. The $38-per-share offer is expected to be divided 45 percent cash and 55 percent Invitrogen stock. Applied Biosystems and Celera Group CRA.N are operating groups of Applera, which announced the deal with Invitrogen. In February, Applera filed to separate itself from Celera, a company once led by entrepreneur Craig Venter, who devised a ground-breaking computer system to analyze the human genome. White said the company's board had previously engaged Morgan Stanley to examine its options, including the sale of Applied Biosystems. He said it is unlikely that another bidder would come in and top Invitrogen's offer, as the company had conducted a thorough process. "I think we have a pretty good handle on the level of interest from other parties," he said. "That doesn't mean someone might not change their mind, but I would be surprised." Indeed, noting that Applied Biosystems' shares were trading well below the offer price, Garp's Mackay said: "The wisdom of the market as it is says no one is going to top this bid." To fund the deal, Invitrogen plans to use cash on hand and proceeds from a fully underwritten debt financing from Bank of America, UBS Investment Bank and Morgan Stanley. The total debt of the combined company would be $3.5 billion, including $2 billion in new debt. The companies expect the merger to close in the fall. The combination is expected to be neutral or to slightly help earnings per share in the first year, and be significantly positive in the second year. Invitrogen expects earnings per share to grow 20 percent in 2010 and beyond, company officials said on a conference call. The deal has a break-up fee of $150 million. Some investors expect Invitrogen to divest Applied Biosystems' mass spectrometer business since the machines -- which can measure the weight of molecules -- do not use reagents, which need to be replaced and thus represent a recurring source of income. Lucier declined on a conference call to discuss his strategy for the mass spectrometry business in detail. For now, he said, the business is a good one and "we continue to run it for success." Invitrogen shares fell $3.77 or 8.7 percent to $39.58 in afternoon trading on Nasdaq. Applied Biosystems shares rose $2.14 or 6.6 percent to $34.58 on the New York Stock Exchange.
