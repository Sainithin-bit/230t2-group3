 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Brewing giant InBev INTB.BR aims to find a friendly takeover agreement with its U.S. target Anheuser-Busch ( BUD.N ), InBev CEO Carlos Brito said on Thursday. 

 "Our objective is to reach a friendly agreement with their board," he told a conference call with analysts a day after InBev announced its unsolicited $46.3 billion bid. "We think their board will act in the best interest of shareholders," Brito added. The offer of $65 per share for Anheuser-Busch is a full and fair price, InBev said. Dividends may be reduced for two to three years, InBev top executives told the conference call, adding that they expected dividends to resume at former levels after that. Belgium-based InBev, formed by the 2004 merger of Belgium's Interbrew with Brazil's AmBev, made on Wednesday an unsolicited $46.3 billion bid to buy Anheuser-Busch Cos and create the world's largest brewer.
