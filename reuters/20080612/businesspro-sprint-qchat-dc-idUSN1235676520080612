 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Sprint Nextel Corp ( S.N ) said on 
Thursday it will launch a walkie-talkie style mobile phone 
service in 40 U.S. markets on June 15, based on Qualcomm Inc's 
( QCOM.O ) QChat technology. 

  The service, which lets customers chat with each other at 
the touch of a button, rather than having to dial a number, is 
aimed at helping Sprint hold on to high-value monthly 
bill-paying customers who have been fleeing Sprint's service.  Sprint, the No. 3 U.S. mobile service, has been working 
with Qualcomm to get QChat to work on its network based on CDMA 
technology since it bought Nextel Communications in 2005.  Nextel, which runs a different network based on iDen 
technology, also offers a walkie-talkie style service that has 
been hugely popular among workers in such industries as 
construction and transportation.  But since the companies merged, problems on the Nextel 
network have depleted its subscriber numbers. QChat could 
enable Sprint to move Nextel customers to Sprint's service.  Sprint launched QChat in three markets in April for 
business customers. Starting June 15, it will be available in 
markets such as Boston, Chicago, New York City, Orlando, 
Florida, Philadelphia and Houston.  QChat service fees start at $49.99 a month, Sprint said.  It will work on four phones, including the PRO-200 and the 
PRO-700 from Sanyo Electric Co Ltd 6764.T; the LX400 from LG 
Electronics Inc ( 066570.KS ); and the Z400 from Samsung 
Electronics Co Ltd ( 005930.KS ).  The phones range in price from $49.99 to $99.99 for 
customers who sign up for two-year contracts.  (Reporting by  Sinead Carew ; editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)
