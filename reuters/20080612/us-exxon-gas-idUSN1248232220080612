 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Exxon is getting out of retail gas business, according to the Dallas Morning News and Fox Business News. 

 Exxon was not immediately available to comment on the news. The Dallas Morning News reported Exxon said it will sell the 2,220 service stations it still owns across the United States. There are 12,000 Exxon Mobil branded stations, the majority of which are already owned by families or companies outside of Exxon. (Reporting by Edward Tobin; Editing by  Gary Hill )
