 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc and Google Inc are close to reaching a search advertising deal, and talks between Yahoo and Microsoft Corp about a similar deal have fallen through, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday. 

 Talks between Microsoft and Yahoo concluded after Yahoo decided to pursue a deal with Google, one of the sources said. Yahoo also asked Microsoft if it would renew its $33-a-share takeover offer for the Internet company, but Microsoft was not interested, another source said.
