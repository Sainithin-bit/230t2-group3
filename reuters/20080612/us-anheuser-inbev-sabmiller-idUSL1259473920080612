 LONDON  (Reuters) - The world's largest brewer SABMiller Plc on Thursday said a link-up between Belgium's InBev and Anheuser-Busch will not change dramatically the global brewing competitive market. 

 "We do not think this changes the competitive landscape dramatically given Anheuser-Busch's small presence outside the United States," an SABMiller spokesman told Reuters. On Wednesday, InBev launched a $46.3 billion cash bid at $65 per Anheuser share, and the U.S. brewer said it will evaluate the bid carefully. An InBev-Anheuser deal would combine the world second largest and fourth largest brewer to knock SABMiller off top spot in world brewing in terms of global beer volumes.
