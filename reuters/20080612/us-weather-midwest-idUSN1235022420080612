 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Violent storms moved through the U.S. Midwest in the past day, dumping more rain across flooded crop fields, a forecaster said on Thursday. 

 More rain is headed to the Corn Belt, washing out fields, providing no relief to young crops standing in water which is expected to cut yield potential. "The only thing changing with this pattern is that we're going from wet and mild to wet and cool," said Mike Palmerino, forecaster with DTN Meteorlogix. "It will be reminiscent of the latter part of May. "The issues with all this wetness are just going to continue and will likely get worse." Powerful storms hit the western Corn Belt on Wednesday, spawning more than 30 tornadoes. Four teenagers at a Boy Scout camp in Iowa and two people in Kansas were killed by tornadoes. Heavy rains accompanied the storms, with 0.75 inch to 2.5 inches of rain, locally heavier falling in the western belt. More rains of 0.3 to 1.5 inch, locally heavier, are headed to the western belt on Thursday, favoring the southern and eastern portions. Friday and Saturday should be mostly clear, then rains return for Sunday-Monday. Some spots could get more than an inch of rainfall. East of the Mississippi River, which was dry on Wednesday, will see rains of 0.3 inch to 2.0 inches, locally heavier over the next two days. The next storm was expected to move through the east Sunday-Monday, dumping another 0.3 to 1.5 inch of rain, locally heavier. Temperatures will be normal to below for the next seven days in the west as highs will be in 70s to low 80s degrees Fahrenheit. The eastern belt will be warmer with highs in the low to mid 80s through Sunday. Then it turns cooler as highs stay in the 70s. Meteorlogix six- to 10-day Midwest outlook, Tuesday to Saturday, called for normal to below-normal temperatures and normal to above-normal rainfall.
