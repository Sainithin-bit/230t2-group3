 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The chairman of a U.S. Senate antitrust subcommittee said on Thursday lawmakers would "closely examine" the collaboration between Google Inc and Yahoo Inc. 

 Democratic Sen. Herb Kohl of Wisconsin said the deal between Google and Yahoo "raises significant competition concerns." "The consequences for advertisers and consumers could be far-reaching and warrant careful review, and we plan to investigate the competitive and privacy implications of this deal further in the Antitrust Subcommittee," Kohl said in a statement.
