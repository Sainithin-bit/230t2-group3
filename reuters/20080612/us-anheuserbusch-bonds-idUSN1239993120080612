 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. brewer Anheuser-Busch ( BUD.N ) bonds weakened on Thursday after it received an unsolicited $46 billion bid from European beermaker InBev INTB.BR, which is expected to be financed with debt. 

 Spreads on Budweiser-maker Anheuser-Busch's 5.5 percent notes due in 2018 widened by 21 basis points to 204 basis points over Treasuries, according to MarketAxess data. (Reporting by Anastasija Johnson; Editing by Theodore d'Afflisio)
