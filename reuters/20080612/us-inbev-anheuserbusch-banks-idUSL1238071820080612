 LONDON  (Reuters) - JP Morgan ( JPM.N )jumped to second from third place on a league table of the world's top M&A advisers for 2008 so far thanks to its role as adviser on InBev's INTB.BR $46.3 billion offer for Anheuser-Busch ( BUD.N ), data from Thomson Reuters showed on Thursday. 

 The bank has leapfrogged previous No. 2 Citigroup ( C.N ), pulling in a total of $414.5 billion worth of deals since January 1. Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) retains its top ranking, working on $515.3 worth of transactions. InBev's lead financial adviser Lazard Ltd ( LAZ.N ) now comes 12th, up from 18th. Belgium-based InBev, formed by the 2004 merger of Belgium's Interbrew with Brazil's AmBev, is the world's second largest beer producer by volume. It announced on Wednesday its bid for Anheuser-Busch, aimed at creating the world's largest brewer. The planned takeover is the second largest deal so far this year after Altria Group Inc's ( MO.N ) $113 billion spinoff of Philip Morris International ( PM.N ). League table credit, used by banks to attract clients, is more vital than ever as economic uncertainty and the fallout from the credit crunch keep dealmaking tough.
