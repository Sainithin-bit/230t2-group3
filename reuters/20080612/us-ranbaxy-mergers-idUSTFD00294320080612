 TOKYO  (Reuters) - India's Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd ( RANB.BO ) sees tremendous opportunities for growth in Japan's generics drug market and mergers and acquisitions are a likely option for it to expand, its chief executive said on Thursday. 

 "I think we would use a combination of organic and inorganic growth to strengthen our presence," Ranbaxy Chief Executive Malvinder Singh told a news conference. "There is tremendous opportunity here and clearly we would want to explore it to the fullest," he said. (Reporting by  Edwina Gibbs )
