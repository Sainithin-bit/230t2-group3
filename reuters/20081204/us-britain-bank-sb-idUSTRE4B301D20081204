 LONDON  (Reuters) - The Bank of England could slash interest rates to their lowest in more than half a century later on Thursday amid mounting evidence the rapidly sinking economy may be heading for a full-blown depression. 

 Policymakers had already discussed slicing more than 200 basis points off borrowing costs last month, but opted for a smaller, though still spectacular, 150 basis point reduction to 3 percent because they did not want to spook the markets. However, a rapid deterioration in business conditions since then has raised fears Britain could be heading for a much deeper downturn than anybody expected, and analysts warn policymakers must act now to ward off the much graver threat of deflation. Banks have clamped down on lending, choking off the lifeblood to businesses and the housing market, unemployment is soaring and consumer confidence has taken a dive. Stores are slashing prices, desperate to pull in shoppers. And a survey on Wednesday showed the services sector, which accounts for three-quarters of economic output, contracted at a record rate in November, indicating the economic downturn may have gathered momentum toward the end of this year. "They need to do something aggressive again, because of where the data's been taking us," said George Buckley, chief UK economist at Deutsche Bank, who sees a 100 basis point cut on Thursday, with a risk of a 150 basis point reduction. "Is it better to cut rates gradually, or take them down to a very low level very quickly, because that's going to have a much larger impact over a longer period of time?" A Reuters poll this week reflected that view, with 40 out of 62 economists expecting a full one percentage point cut to 2 percent. HOW LOW WILL THEY GO? Markets are pricing in UK rates falling to as low as 1 percent next year and the pound has fallen dramatically in recent sessions, hitting a 13-year low against other currencies on a trade-weighted basis on Wednesday, in anticipation of much lower interest rates. Former BoE policymaker Willem Buiter called this week for the central bank to bring rates down to zero and start pumping cash into the economy to bring it back to life, like Japan did in the 1990s when its economy dived and deflation took hold. "If zero is the floor, there is no reason not to go there immediately," Buiter wrote in his Financial Times blog. His former colleagues will probably want to wait and see what impact the government's 20 billion pound fiscal package will have on the economy before they take such a dramatic course of action. Still, the Monetary Policy Committee is only too aware that with banks still reluctant to lend to companies and individuals, despite receiving a cash boost from the government, it has little choice but to keep cutting rates. "We will take whatever action we feel is necessary on interest rates to steer the economy back into calmer waters," Governor Mervyn King told a parliamentary committee last week. "We may need to cut Bank Rate more than we would otherwise have done." And a growing number of analysts reckon there is a strong chance borrowing costs could soon be next to nothing. "We are increasingly of the view that rates will be pulled down close to zero and held there for the foreseeable future," said Philip Shaw, economist at Investec.
