 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. health-club operator Bally Total Fitness Holding Corp received interim bankruptcy court approval on Thursday to pay employee wages and access cash, until another hearing is held on Tuesday. 

 Judge Stuart Bernstein heard and granted the company's first-day motions, allowing the Bally clubs to continue operations. The case on December 9 will move to Judge Burton Lifland, who will rehear the motions. On Wednesday, the Chicago-based company and 42 affiliates filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors. It is the second time in 17 months Bally has filed for bankruptcy. SALE? Bally is currently in discussions with members of the first-lien bank group to receive debtor-in-possession financing in connection with a sale of the company, Bally attorney Kenneth Eckstein told reporters after the hearing at the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York in Manhattan. Eckstein declined to be more specific. "We are in active discussions with parties," said Eckstein. "The company is going to be evaluating that transaction." If the deal went through with the parties currently in negotiations, it would occur within about 45 days, Eckstein said. The company has said it can reorganize on its own if it fails to arrange a sale. Judge Bernstein granted the company's request to access its cash collateral until the next hearing. Bally has $17 million in cash in its bank accounts and is expecting to receive about $3.5 million more over the next 35 days, according to court documents. The cash will be used to operate the business. The company can also pay employees for pre-petition salaries and the judge approved its request to continue honoring its bonus- points program. 2ND BANKRUPTCY Bally filed for bankruptcy protection once before, in July 2007, and emerged as a privately held company in October 2007 after receiving $233.6 million from hedge fund Harbinger Capital Partners, which took a 100 percent equity stake. In a court filing, Bally lawyers said the company "encountered a liquidity crisis" in the summer of 2008 because of declining fees and dues and rising operating costs and capital spending. "There were significant fundamental operating problems encountered after emerging from bankruptcy," Eckstein told Judge Bernstein at the hearing. He added the company's "business plan did not succeed, to say the least." Bally said it operates 347 health clubs serving more than 3.1 million customers and employs 14,570 people. It had $1.38 billion of assets and $1.54 billion of debts as of September 30, and has more than 100,000 creditors. (Reporting by Chelsea Emery, editing by Gerald E. McCormick and  Andre Grenon )
