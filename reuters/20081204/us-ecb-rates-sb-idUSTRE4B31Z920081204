 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - The European Central Bank is expected to cut interest rates sharply on Thursday after a huge Swedish rate reduction stunned financial markets and abruptly raised expectations of a bigger than forecast move. 

 ECB policymakers will be armed with a new set of in-house forecasts likely to confirm that the euro zone economy is in serious trouble. Opinions on how far the ECB will move had been split between those who thought it would stick to a tried-and-tested 50 basis point cut or go for a record 75 basis points or more. Record rate cuts from two leading central banks changed the mood. "Following the surprising 175 basis point ease by the Riksbank this morning, we now believe you should expect at least 100bp of easing from the ECB later," said David Mackie, head of Western European economic research at JPMorgan. Hours before ECB policymakers were due to announce their decision, Sweden's central bank slashed its key interest rate by a record 175 basis points to 2.00 percent to try to prevent the economy from sliding deeper into recession. Economists had expected a big move, but the outcome was still far more than they had predicted and dwarfed its previous largest cuts of just 50 basis points. Earlier on Thursday the Reserve Bank of New Zealand lowered its key rate by 150 points to 5.0 percent to protect an economy battered by the global slowdown. As recently as Tuesday, most analysts still predicted only a 50 basis point ECB cut which would take euro zone rates to 2.75 percent -- a two year low. However, a significant minority thought policymakers will go for a 75, or even 100 basis point cut. Markets reacted sharply to the Riksbank decision and EONIA interest rate futures moved to discount a 75 basis point ECB cut fully. Sterling fell broadly, hitting a record low against the euro and its weakest versus the dollar in 6-1/2 years due to expectations that the Bank of England would also slash rates later in the day. This month's ECB meeting is taking place in Brussels, one of the bank's two away-days from its Frankfurt home and comes at a crucial time. The financial crisis is beginning to inflict major damage on the euro zone, money market problems show little sign of abating and Europe's governments are in the middle of hammering out how much money they will pump into their recession-hit economies. The meeting started at 0800 GMT (3 a.m. EST), the rate decision will be announced at 1245 GMT (7:45 a.m. EST)and President Jean-Claude Trichet will hold a news conference at 1330 GMT where he will explain the decision, give details of new staff economic forecasts and take questions. The 15-nation bloc was officially declared in recession last month following a second quarterly contraction in economic output and analysts don't see the economy growing again until the third quarter of next year -- and then only marginally. Adding to the European gloom on Thursday Credit Suisse said it was slashing another 5,300 jobs, 11 percent of its total workforce, Nomura said it would axe up to 1,000 European staff and electronics to lighting firm Philips became the latest corporate giant to warn on profits. FORECASTS The ECB will have a new set of ECB staff forecasts, which for the first time will stretch into 2010, will be enough to sway the more cautious at the ECB. "The Governing Council will have the benefit of a full update of its growth and inflation forecasts - that will almost certainly show sharp downward revisions," said Nick Kounis, Chief European Economist at Fortis bank before the Riksbank announcement. "Members will not have to exercise caution because of a sense that they are shooting in the dark... we think that it (the ECB) is more flexible than commonly perceived and will cut rates by a record 75 basis points because the data justify at least that amount." he added.
