 LONDON  (Reuters) - The Bank of England slashed interest rates by one percentage point to 2.0 percent on Thursday, taking borrowing costs to their lowest in more than half a century amid signs the economy is heading for a deep recession. 

 Following are reactions from business groups and economists to the decision. GRAEME LEACH, CHIEF ECONOMIST, INSTITUTE OF DIRECTORS "The MPC decision is bold but necessary. The MPC is clearly taking the view that the longer deep interest rate cuts are delayed the worse the recession is likely to become. The MPC still has some ammunition left but not a lot. We can expect further rate reductions early in 2009 but then the MPC will have exhausted its interest rate armory." IAN MCCAFFERTY, CBI CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISOR "The economy needs a significant monetary stimulus and the Bank has clearly decided this will be best achieved by another big cut in interest rates. What is critical for business and consumers alike is that this reduction is passed on. "The economy is stalling, inflation is expected to undershoot the Bank's own target and the headline RPI rate of inflation is likely to turn negative for at least a few months in 2009. We need to see lending improve and to keep business working."
