 BEIJING  (Reuters) - Zhou Xiaochuan, governor of the People's Bank of China, told Thursday's opening session of the cabinet-level Sino-American "Strategic Economic Dialogue" to prepare for the worst scenario, a PBOC official told reporters. 

 Officials said Zhou later flew to the United States for reasons that were not disclosed. Zhou expressed confidence that China could sustain economic growth and financial stability but said there was a need for "timely, effective and pre-emptive measures" to tackle the deepening financial and economic crisis, Jin Qi, head of the PBOC's international department, said.
