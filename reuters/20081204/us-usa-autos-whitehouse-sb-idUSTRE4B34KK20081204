 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - It is too early to judge the restructuring plans put forward by the ailing U.S. automakers, the White House said on Thursday, adding that the administration wanted to hear their testimony to Congress first. 

 "I think it's too early to give these plans a grade," said White House spokeswoman Dana Perino. "I also think that since the Democratic leadership invited the automakers to come to Washington to testify in front of them today and tomorrow, that we should then allow them to do that before passing any judgment on their plans." General Motors Corp, Ford Motor Co and privately held Chrysler LLC have sought $34 billion in loans and credit lines from the government as they also made pledges to slash costs and introduce more fuel-efficient models. The chief executives are testifying to Congress on Thursday and Friday to offer details and answer questions by lawmakers. "We will be watching that testimony closely," Perino said. The administration has supported legislation that would redirect $25 billion in aid already available for helping Detroit make more fuel-efficient vehicles. Since the car manufacturers are seeking more than that amount, Perino told reporters that the White House has said previously that the administration has been open to adding money to that program. "One of the things that we have always said to the members of Congress is that if they felt that they needed -- wanted to put more money into that 136 (energy loan) program that we would consider that," she said. But one caveat by the White House has been that officials there argue government aid should only go to those manufacturers who can prove long-term viability.
