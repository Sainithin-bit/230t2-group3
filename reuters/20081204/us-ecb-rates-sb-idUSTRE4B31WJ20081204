 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - The European Central Bank is expected to cut interest rates sharply on Thursday after a huge Swedish rate reduction stunned financial markets, stoking speculation of a record euro zone move. 

 ECB policymakers will be armed with a new set of in-house forecasts likely to confirm that the euro zone economy is in serious trouble. These might also encourage the normally cautious Governing Council to act boldly. Opinions on how far the ECB will move had been split between those who thought it would stick to a tried-and-tested 50 basis point cut, which would be its third by that amount in less than two months, or opt for a record 75 basis points or more. Record rate cuts by two leading central banks on Thursday fanned bets on a bumper move in the euro zone as well, with financial markets fully pricing in a 75 basis point cut from the current 3.25 percent, and some seeing even more. "The ECB has to be bold now," said Kenneth Broux, financial markets economist at Lloyds TSB. David Mackie, head of Western European economic research at JPMorgan, also predicted the ECB would cast caution aside. "Following the surprising 175 basis point ease by the (Swedish) Riksbank this morning, we now believe you should expect at least 100bp of easing from the ECB later," he said. However, other analysts disagreed the ECB would go that far. "I don't think it (the Riksbank) really changes anything. The ECB is just more cautious in the way it sets out monetary policy," said Barclays Capital economist Julian Callow. "I would have thought 75 basis points is likely, 100 is an outside chance but with ECB officials having made such issue to proceed steadily I don't see them really going by more than 75." RBS economists said a large cut was justified but the ECB had shown it could resist outside pressure and they stuck to their forecast of a 50 basis point cut. Hours before ECB policymakers were due to announce their decision, Sweden's central bank slashed its key interest rate by a record 175 basis points to 2.00 percent to try to prevent the economy from sliding deeper into recession. Economists had expected a big move, but the outcome was still far more than they had predicted and dwarfed its previous largest cuts of just 50 basis points. Earlier on Thursday the Reserve Bank of New Zealand set the standard by lowering its key rate by 150 points to 5.0 percent to protect an economy battered by the global slowdown. As recently as Tuesday, most analysts still predicted only a 50 basis point ECB cut, which would take euro zone rates to a two-year low of 2.75 percent. However, 24 of 81 in a Reuters poll forecast a bigger move. Markets reacted sharply to the Riksbank decision and EONIA interest rate futures firmed up expectations of a 75 basis point ECB cut. Sterling fell broadly, hitting a record low against the euro and its weakest versus the dollar in 6-1/2 years due to expectations that the Bank of England would also slash rates later in the day. AWAY DAY This month's ECB meeting is taking place in Brussels, one of the bank's two away-days from its Frankfurt home. French economy minister Christine Lagarde, who this week called for the ECB to cut rates, will also sit in on proceedings. It comes at a crucial time. The financial crisis is beginning to inflict major damage on the euro zone, money market problems show little sign of abating and Europe's governments are in the middle of hammering out how much money they will pump into their recession-hit economies. The meeting started at 0800 GMT (3 am EST) and the rate decision will be announced at 1245 GMT (7:45 am EST). President Jean-Claude Trichet will hold a news conference at 1330 GMT to explain the decision and give details of new staff economic forecasts. The 15-nation bloc was officially declared in recession last month following a second quarterly contraction in economic output. Analysts don't see the economy growing again until the third quarter of next year -- and then only marginally. Adding to the European gloom on Thursday Credit Suisse said it was slashing another 5,300 jobs, 11 percent of its total workforce, Nomura said it would axe up to 1,000 European staff and electronics-to-lighting firm Philips became the latest corporate giant to warn on profits. FORECASTS The ECB will have a new set of staff forecasts, which for the first time will stretch into 2010, and these may be enough to sway the more cautious policymakers. "The Governing Council will have the benefit of a full update of its growth and inflation forecasts -- that will almost certainly show sharp downward revisions," said Nick Kounis, Chief European Economist at Fortis bank. "Members will not have to exercise caution because of a sense that they are shooting in the dark," he said before the Riksbank announcement. "We think that it (the ECB) is more flexible than commonly perceived and will cut rates by a record 75 basis points because the data justify at least that amount."
