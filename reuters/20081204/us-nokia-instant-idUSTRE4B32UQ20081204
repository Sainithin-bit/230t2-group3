 HELSINKI  (Reuters) - The world's top cell phone maker Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ) said on Thursday it saw mobile phone sales falling by 5 percent or more next year. 

 Following are comments by analysts on Nokia announcement: GREGER JOHANSSON, Redeye "What is negative is that they indicate that Q4 will be worse than what they have said previously. But more important is what they say about next year. They say that volumes will decline 5 percent or more, but the market had expected a decline of 6 percent or more. Also, they are adjusting their margin targets, but that was anticipated." "(The share reaction) is a relief rally, because nothing very serious was said with regard to the development looking forward. The market will not have to make any big adjustments for 2009." HAKAN WRANNE, Swedbank "We note that they are not giving a floor for their market forecast and that they are giving a broader range for the margin than they usually do. This of course reflects the uncertainty that exists in the market right now. "Nokia can quite simply not forecast the situation with any greater precision. That says something of the uncertainty about the prospects for next year. One simply can't see that far ahead at the moment." "It (the stock) is up a little bit, which may be due to there were fears that they might say something even worse." SAMI SARKAMIES, Nordea: "The most positive news was next year's view of increased market share, also in smartphones, where the company has lost market share this year." "First half of 2009 will be weak, stocks throughout the supply chain will be lowered then, which will add to a hit." BEN WOOD, CCS INSIGHT: "2009 will be the most challenging year the mobile industry had ever faced." "The outlook for the mobile phone market continues to deteriorate. Nokia's guidance will depress the market given its role as the bellwether of the industry." CAROLINA MILANESI, Gartner: "Nokia's expectations for the fourth quarter are now in line with what we previously stated. For 2009 we are slightly more optimistic. Net new subscribers will be enough to hold the market at around -1 to -2 percent. Despite the challenging environment Nokia remains in the best position to deal with consumers needs thanks to their economies of scale and channel strategy."
