 DUBAI  (Reuters) - Oman's top banks said on Sunday they had a total exposure of $77 million to troubled conglomerate Dubai World, sending shares of most lenders down nearly 6 percent. 

 The country's central bank governor said the exposure announced by three banks was "about the total" and that there was no need to require local banks to book provisions for their exposure as it was not related to loans under restructuring. "There will be no surprises," Hamood Sangour al-Zadjali told Al Arabiya television, referring to the exposure of the sultanate's banking system to Dubai World. Muscat's bourse had asked all listed banks to disclose any exposure to Dubai World Group whether directly or indirectly. Government-owned Dubai World requested a payment standstill on November 25 for $3.52 billion worth of Islamic bonds maturing this month as it looks to restructure $26 billion worth of debt. Zadjali said on Sunday the debt was not part of the $26 billion figure. "I don't think (Omani) banks are dealing in these instruments of Islamic banks," he said in response to a question on whether part of the exposure is to Nakheel's Islamic bonds. Bank Muscat, Oman's largest lender by market value, said earlier on Sunday it had 19.25 million riyals ($50 million) in exposure to a syndicated loan from the group, the biggest of three exposures, which was still fairly limited compared to other regional and international banks. "These are all regular loans and they are not due at present. Their due dates start in mid next year," central bank chief Zadjali said. Bank Muscat's shares closed 5.9 percent lower at 0.77 rials a share. "I think Bank Muscat's exposure is better than expected," Adel Nasr, brokerage manager at United Securities in Muscat, told Reuters. "Dubai Holding has a 15 percent stake in the bank so there were expectations its exposure could be as much as 50 million riyals," he said. Bank Sohar declined 3.5 percent after it said its exposure was $4.3 million. Both Bank Muscat and Bank Sohar said their loans were still being serviced. National Bank of Oman, the country's third largest bank fell 6 percent after it said it had $22.6 million of exposure. Bank Dhofar, Oman's second largest bank, jumped 9.7 percent on thin volumes, after it said it had no exposure, while Oman International Bank and Ahli Bank also said they had no exposure. The exposures are minimal compared to the reported $5 billion combined exposure of four British banks. The Financial Times said last week Royal Bank of Scotland was the most exposed with between $1 billion and $2 billion, citing bankers and advisers. HSBC, Standard Chartered and Lloyds Banking Group had exposure of about $1 billion each, the report said. A senior executive at Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank told Reuters the bank has about $2.18 billion to $2.45 billion of exposure to Dubai World and related entities, While National Bank of Abu Dhabi said it had $345 million in total, the first such disclosure by a major regional lender. Dubai firms have yet to announce their exposure, although Emirates NBD is reported to have exposure of about $3 billion. On Friday, Muhammad al-Jasser, governor of the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency, said Saudi banks had limited exposure to Dubai World. ($1=0.3850 rials) (Editing by  John Irish )
