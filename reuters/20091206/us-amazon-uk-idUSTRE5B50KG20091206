 LONDON  (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc ( AMZN.O ), the world's largest online retailer, has no plans to open stores anywhere in the world, it said on Sunday, in response to a report it was planning to open high street shops in Britain. 

 A spokesman for the group said it had no plans to open physical stores after the Sunday Times reported the group was looking to cash in on the rising customer demand for so-called click and collect services, where customers buy goods online and pick them up from a shop. The Sunday Times report, which cited property landlords and a source familiar with the proposals, said the offer would save consumers from having to wait in for home deliveries. The Amazon spokesman declined to comment any further on the report, including whether it could partner with retailers, or its future plans. (Reporting by  Kate Holton ; editing by Karen Foster)
