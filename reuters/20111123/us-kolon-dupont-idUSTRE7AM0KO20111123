 SEOUL  (Reuters) - A U.S. court awarded DuPont ( DD.N ) $920.3 million in damages on Tuesday, ruling that South Korea's Kolon Industries Inc ( 120110.KS ) violated trade secrets for a fiber used to make Kevlar bulletproof vests, Kolon said on Wednesday. 
 The South Korean firm said in a regulatory filing that it would appeal the decision and take all legal measures in response to the court ruling. A U.S. federal jury in September ordered Kolon Industries Inc to pay $919.9 million in damages after finding the textile company willfully and maliciously stole trade secrets and confidential information regarding its Kevlar para-aramid fiber.
