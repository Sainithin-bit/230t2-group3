 ZURICH  (Reuters) - Roche Holding AG, Europe's largest drugmaker by market value, posted first-quarter sales up 2 percent in local currencies to 10.9 billion Swiss francs ($10.86 billion), hit by loss of pandemic Tamiflu sales, and missing forecasts. 

 Roche ( ROG.VX ) on Thursday confirmed its full-year forecast, saying it expected sales to increase at a high single-digit rate in 2008 and both its drugs and diagnostics units to outpace the market. "Despite considerably lower Tamiflu pandemic sales and significantly higher R&D spending, Roche is aiming for 2008 core EPS at constant exchange rates to remain at least in line with the record level achieved in 2007," the company said in a statement. Many pharmaceuticals makers face slowing earnings growth due to the loss of exclusivity on key drugs, pricing pressures and more complicated paths to market. Roche has so far been able to avoid the worst of the sector's troubles, though analysts had expected its first quarter to be hurt by the weak dollar and previously flagged loss of sales of flu drug Tamiflu for government stockpiling. Roche trades at about 12 times forecast 2009 earnings, a premium to the other large-cap European drugmakers thanks to its promising new drugs, limited exposure to copy-cat generic competition and profitable partnership with U.S. biotech company Genentech Inc DNA.N. Basel-based Roche had been expected to post first-quarter sales of 11.45 billion francs, according to a Reuters poll of 19 analysts. (Reporting by  Sam Cage )
