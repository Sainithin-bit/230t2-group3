 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Merrill Lynch & Co Inc MER.N on Thursday posted a first quarter loss, after taking several billion dollars of writedowns for subprime mortgages and other risky assets. 

 The world's largest brokerage said the first quarter loss was $1.96 billion, or $2.19 a share, compared with net income of $2.16 billion, or $2.26 a share, in the same quarter last year. The following is reaction from industry analysts and other experts: PAUL MENDELSOHN, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST AT WINDHAM FINANCIAL SERVICES IN CHARLOTTE, VERMONT "Rumors were floating around that it was anticipated their numbers would not be good. (The shares) are just a little bit to the low side. It came down a little last night in anticipation. But it doesn't' look like anything catastrophic will happen." MIKE LENHOFF, CHIEF STRATEGIST AT BREWIN DOLPHIN, LONDON "The expectations for earnings have been dramatically, greatly downgraded. It just strikes me that there is very little scope for shock value. Therefore I don't think the market will be going to be very fazed by what's happening in the financial sector."
