 LONDON  (Reuters) - World stocks rose to a one-week high on Thursday after better-than-expected corporate earnings announcements reassured investors that companies around the world are holding up despite the credit crisis. 

 The dollar fell to match all-time lows against the euro near $1.60 set on Wednesday, with weakness in the U.S. currency helping to drive up oil prices to new record highs above $115 a barrel. Better-than-expected results from tech bellwethers Intel ( INTC.O ) on Tuesday and IBM ( IBM.N ) on Wednesday added to a recent list of positive surprises in first-quarter earnings, feeding optimism that tighter lending and credit conditions are not affecting the economy as much as many had feared. Results from the banking sector -- the epicenter of the eight-month-old credit crisis -- showed financial firms are scrubbing their books clean to deal with problems. "What the market is most sensitive to in this earnings cycle is any hint, any sign that we're past the worst for the financial sector. Even more so, the concern for the rest of the market is the degree to which earnings are holding up," said Bernard McAlinden, strategist at NCB Stockbrokers in Dublin. The FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.2 percent while MSCI main world equity index rose 0.3 percent to a one-week high. Late on Wednesday, EBay ( EBAY.O ) posted a forecast-topping 22 percent rise in quarterly net profit. Key firms reporting their Q1 results later include Bank of New York Mellon ( BK.N ), Merrill Lynch MER.N and Pfizer ( PFE.N ). The dollar fell 0.1 percent to $1.5977 per euro. "There's quite a lot of momentum behind the euro," said Paul Robson, currency strategist at RBS Global Banking, adding that he saw a break above $1.60 in the next week or so. "The euro is probably one of the only safe ports in the current credit-tightening storm, and that's been giving euro a little bit of a boost." LIBOR STORM Daily fixing of interbank reference rates in London due just before 1100 GMT is set to attract attention as concerns about the credibility of the rates are affecting some interest rate markets. The spread on two-year U.S. interest rate swaps widened sharply on Wednesday to their widest level in about five weeks as a result of these concerns. In recent months, market participants have questioned the validity of the LIBOR rates, at which banks offer to lend unsecured funds to each other and which are used for setting prices of a wide range of financial instruments. Critics say LIBOR rates come from a small group of banks and do not accurately reflect the rates at which banks are willing to lend to each other, especially in times of stress. The British Bankers Association said it had brought forward a review of its setting process. Since the credit crisis broke in August, a gap between LIBOR rates and Overnight Index Swaps -- a short-term benchmark rate for secured funds -- has widened to more than 100 basis points. European credit spreads improved, with the iTraxx Crossover index tightening 10 basis points to 496 bps. Emerging sovereign spreads were steady while emerging stocks were up 0.7 percent. The June Bund future was steady on the day. U.S. light crude had risen as high as $115.45 a barrel. The dollar's weakness and a fall in U.S. gasoline stockpiles just weeks ahead of the summer driving season have attracted fresh fund buying. Gold edged higher to $948.75 an ounce.
