 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Baxter International Inc ( BAX.N ) posted a 6 percent increase in quarterly profit on Thursday and raised its 2008 outlook, but also announced another delay in getting its Colleague infusion pump back on the U.S. market. 

 The maker of blood therapy products, medication delivery systems and products used for kidney therapy, issued the higher profit outlook despite slow progress on Colleague, an intravenous pump that delivers medication and fluids into the bloodstream. The device was recalled almost two years ago. Last quarter, Baxter said it expected the pump to be back on the U.S. market in the second half of 2008. "I wouldn't say it has hurt our credibility," Chief Financial Officer Robert Davis said in a telephone interview. "People judge a company by how it responds to an event like this and I feel proud of how we've responded. From a financial perspective, it's manageable, otherwise we would not have raised our guidance." Better gross margins, firmer pricing on most products, greater manufacturing efficiencies and favorable foreign exchange translations also bolstered results. The gross margin, Chief Executive Robert Parkinson told a conference call, is "the most important financial metric that I look at and it is what I hold my line business executives to in terms of accountability." He said he expected continued improvements in margins for the foreseeable future. First-quarter net earnings were $429 million, or 67 cents per share, compared with $403 million, or 61 cents per share, a year ago. CHARGES WEIGH ON EARNINGS Results include an after-tax charge of $45 million for costs associated with the company's Colleague infusion pump remediation program and costs related to its recall of heparin blood thinner in the United States. Excluding that charge, Baxter earned 74 cents per share. On that basis, analysts on average expected a profit of 72 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Its investment in research and development of $190 million increased 19 percent in the first quarter. First-quarter revenue rose 8 percent to $2.9 billion from a year ago, led by a 13 percent increase in sales in Baxter's Bioscience business, which makes, among other things, blood therapy products. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange and revenue from Transfusion Therapies, which was divested in the first quarter of 2007, sales rose 4 percent. Deerfield, Illinois-based Baxter said it expects 2008 earnings per share of $3.18 to $3.24, before one-time items, up from its previous forecast of $3.10 to $3.18 per share, excluding items. The company also slashed its forecast for Colleague sales for the year to $30 million from $75 million. The $30 million represents replacement pump sales to existing U.S. customers. Baxter continues to expect sales growth, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, of 5 percent to 6 percent. Excluding both Transfusion Therapies and foreign exchange, the company expects sales growth of 6 percent to 7 percent. For the second quarter, Baxter predicted sales growth of 4 to 5 percent, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, and earnings per share, before items, of 81 to 83 cents. Davis said the charges related to its Colleague pump and heparin are behind Baxter now. "This is not something that's going to change our view of Baxter over the long term, but I think it damages Baxter's reputation slightly," Julie Stralow, an analyst with Morningstar, said. Shares of Baxter were down 16 cents to $60.27 in midday New York Stock Exchange trade. (Editing by Steve Orlofsky, Phil Berlowitz)
