 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Recent figures on core inflation have 
been "encouraging" but the United States still faces pressures 
from growing global resource utilization, Dallas Federal 
Reserve Bank President Richard Fisher said on Thursday. 

  Stable longer-term inflation expectations shown in the 
monthly University of Michigan survey are a positive, Fisher 
told reporters after a speech in Chicago. The Fed must "trust 
and verify" the inflation trend from here, he said.  Still, Fisher continued to argue against the need for rate 
cuts to boost the U.S. economy, which he said could stoke 
inflation pressures that would be hard to reign in.  He termed the economy "anemic," if still growing, and said 
it was difficult to judge how long the slowdown would persist.  (Reporting by  Ros Krasny )
