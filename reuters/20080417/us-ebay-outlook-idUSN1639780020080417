 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Internet auction leader eBay Inc ( EBAY.O ) said on Wednesday that 2008 was off to a strong start and the company was increasing its financial outlook despite signs of a weakening in two of its top three markets. 

 "We are encouraged by what we are seeing," eBay Chief Executive John Donahoe told investors on a conference call following its first-quarter report. "With Q1 behind us, I feel very good about the direction we are headed." But the company's presentation cautioned that its 24 percent growth in first-quarter revenue came in the face of a softening economy. EBay said it was increasing its outlook even while feeling cautious about the economic climate. "Softening economies have modestly slowed domestic demand in the U.S. and U.K.," eBay stated in a presentation released on its investor site ahead of the conference call. The United States accounts for 45 percent of eBay revenue. Germany is No. 2 and Britain is the No. 3 eBay market. Donahoe said eBay's long-term plan to revive growth in its core auctions business is showing early signs of progress. The moves involve sweeping changes in how buyers and sellers deal with one another on the site.
