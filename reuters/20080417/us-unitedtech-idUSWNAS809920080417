 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Diversified manufacturer United Technologies Corp ( UTX.N ) posted a 22 percent rise in quarterly profit on Thursday, topping analysts' forecasts, lifted by strong demand for aviation equipment and products used in commercial buildings. 

 The maker of products ranging from Otis elevators to Black Hawk military helicopters did not raise its full-year profit forecast, citing signs that the U.S. and European economies are slowing. But it said orders for equipment used in commercial construction were up. That presents a marked contrast to fellow blue-chip industrial General Electric Co ( GE.N ), which last week cut its profit outlook, citing weakness in its financial services business. "As we look to the back half of the year, we continue to adjust our operations in anticipation of the uncertain economic environment," Louis Chenevert, who succeeded George David as CEO of United Tech last week, said in a statement. The world's largest maker of elevators and air conditioners reported first-quarter profit of $1 billion, or $1.03 per share, compared with $819 million, or 82 cents a share, a year earlier. Factoring out 2 cents per share of restructuring charges, profit was $1.05 per share. On that basis, Wall Street had expected, on average, $1.01 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 11.6 percent to $13.7 billion. "UTX pumped out another very solid quarter," Nigel Coe, analyst at Deutsche Bank, wrote in a note to clients, referring to the company by its stock symbol. "The outlook remains cautious." The Hartford, Connecticut-based company confirmed its full-year profit forecast of $4.65 to $4.85 per share. United Tech, which also produces jet engines, has benefited from strong nonresidential building activity, particularly in emerging markets. It generates about 60 percent of its sales outside the United States. United Tech shares eased 1 percent to $71.60 in premarket trading, down from a Wednesday close at $72.63 on the New York Stock Exchange. As of the Wednesday close, the shares were down 5 percent this year, roughly in line with the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI , of which it is a component. United Tech in March made a $2.64 billion offer to acquire Diebold Inc ( DBD.N ), the world's No. 2 maker of automated teller machines. The bid was rejected. United Tech has since disclosed that it has taken a 3.5 percent stake in Diebold, and indicated that it was interested in buying more shares. (Editing by Maureen Bavdek and John Wallace)
