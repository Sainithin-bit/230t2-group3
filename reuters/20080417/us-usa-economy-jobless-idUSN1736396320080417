 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The number of workers applying for unemployment benefits rose by 17,000, which was marginally less than expected, while those of workers remaining on jobless benefits were at the highest level in almost four years, a government report showed on Thursday. 

 Jobless claims climbed to 372,000 in the week ended April 12, the Labor Department said. Analysts polled by Reuters were expecting 375,000. The four-week average of new claims, a more reliable guide to underlying labor market trends because it smoothes out weekly data fluctuation, moderated slightly to 376,000 from a revised 376,750 in the previous week, which was the highest since a big jump in claims after Hurricane Katrina ravaged the Gulf Coast in the fall of 2005. In another sign of strains in the labor market, the number of workers remaining on jobless benefits rose to 2.98 million in the week ended April 5, which the most recent data available and the highest since June 2004. Analysts were expecting continuing claims to ease to 2.93 million from the previously reported 2.94 million. A Labor Department economist said there were no special factors in the report.
