 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc posted a 56 percent jump in operating income and its highest profit margin in years, after grabbing a big share of online spending during the crucial holiday period. 
 Commentary: JORDAN ROHAN, ANALYST, STIFEL NICOLAUS "Incredibly strong margins. This is the highest fourth-quarter margin in North America that they've reported since the third quarter of 2009. The highest in over three years." KEN SENA, ANALYST, EVERCORE PARTNERS "It was a much better-than-expected gross margin, a strong forward indicator to drive margin expansion. What is really important is gross profit dollars and that line is stronger." KERRY RICE, ANALYST, NEEDHAM & COMPANY "Revenue was light. In general, weaker than everyone expected on the top line and guidance was similarly weaker than what everyone was expecting on the top line. There was a massive selloff at the beginning. "I'm not that surprised. We've had a lot of negative retail data points. General suggestions have been that e-commerce was not as strong as people had expected."
