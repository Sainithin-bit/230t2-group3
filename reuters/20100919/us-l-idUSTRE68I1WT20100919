 NEW YORK/PARIS  (Reuters) - Britain's BAE Systems ( BAES.L ) is close to buying the government consulting services business of L-1 Identity Solutions ID.N for about $300 million, sources familiar with the transaction said on Sunday. 

 If confirmed, such a move would allow the rest of the Stamford, Connecticut-based maker of biometric systems to be snapped up by French state-controlled defense company Safran ( SAF.PA ), which sources familiar with the matter last week identified as the front-runner for a deal worth some $1 billion. A BAE Systems ( BAES.L ) spokesman declined to comment, saying it was the company's policy never to discuss merger speculation. Paris-based Safran also declined to comment. L-1, which has been looking for a buyer since February, was not immediately available for a comment. The company is widely said to prefer splitting itself up for a sale given the clear distinction between its biometric identification and government consulting businesses. The sources told Reuters last week that L-1 hoped to wrap up both deals by the end of this month, but that differences remained over valuation. L-1 shares closed at $9.72 on Friday, giving it a market value of $900 million. L-1, formed in 2006 through the merger of Viisage and Identix, combines face and other biometric recognition technologies with credentialing and access control systems for protecting identity. Its products are used by government agencies for improving homeland security and border management, and commercially at financial institutions. It is among a number of mid-tier security and defense companies that have been put on the auction block in recent months as larger contractors target smaller businesses that provide niche technologies in cyber security, surveillance and intelligence and unmanned systems.
