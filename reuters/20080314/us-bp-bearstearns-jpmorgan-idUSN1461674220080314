 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A liquidity crisis has placed Bear Stearns Co BSC.N in peril, prompting the Federal Reserve and JPMorgan Chase ( JPM.N ) to come to the rescue with emergency financing. 

 JPMorgan's role in the rescue, and Bear Stearns' $3.2 billion loss in market value on Friday alone, has some investors looking for a takeover by JPMorgan. The following is snapshot of the two companies: Bear Stearns BSC.N -- 2007 Net Income: $233 million -- Assets: $395.362 billion -- Employees: 14,153 -- Market Capitalization: $3.50 billion -- Recorded fourth-quarter write-downs: $1.9 billion JP Morgan Chase ( JPM.N ) -- 2007 Net Income: $15.365 billion -- Assets: $1.562 trillion -- Employees: 180,667 -- Market Capitalization: $124.1 billion -- Recorded fourth-quarter write-downs: $1.3 billion (Reporting by  Steven Bertoni ; Editing by Leslie Adler)
