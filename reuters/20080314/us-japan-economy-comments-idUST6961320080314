 (Reuters) - Steps to break a deadlock over the selection of Japan's next central bank chief are unlikely to come until just before the current one retires next week, the government's top spokesman said on Friday. 

 Bank of Japan Governor Toshihiko Fukui retires next Wednesday, and uncertainty over who will succeed him may create a monetary policy vacuum in Japan at a time when central banks worldwide are working together to ease a credit crisis. Parliament's lower house, controlled by the ruling coalition, approved the government's choice for the top job, Deputy BOJ Governor Toshiro Muto, on Thursday along with retired central bank official Masaaki Shirakawa and academic Takatoshi Ito as deputies. But coming after the upper house's rejection of Muto and Ito on Wednesday, the vote simply confirmed a political impasse over the central bank's leadership. Of the three nominees, only Shirakawa has won approval from both houses of parliament, to be a deputy governor. Following are recent comments by Japanese policymakers on the selection of the next governor: PRIME MINISTER YASUO FUKUDA, March 14, told parliament: "I feel responsible for the current situation over the BOJ leadership at a time when there are a lot of changes and worries about the global economy and markets. "But given the situation, we need to decide on a central bank governor as soon as possible. "We are talking about the BOJ governor and deputy governors, so we need to decide cautiously and quickly." DEMOCRATIC PARTY SECRETARY-GENERAL YUKIO HATOYAMA, March 14, at a news conference: "If the Democratic Party thinks the candidate is inappropriate, it is hard to imagine that our party would approve the person just because that would be better than leaving the position vacant. "In that case, I am afraid we will have to reject the candidate. We will be doing so for the Japanese people." "In that scenario, people may worry about leaving the position vacant. But we have already approved Shirakawa as a deputy governor. I think it is desirable for a deputy governor to serve as acting governor under the current BOJ law." "We don't want to leave it vacant. But if we ended up having that situation, we should move on within the framework of the BOJ law. Experts overseas have told me that markets will be OK. So I don't think that will lead to any big confusion. Even so, we should not leave the position vacant for long, so I strongly hope for a candidate that we can approve and resolve the issue." "It is beyond the realm of possibility that our party will approve a person who we rejected once." CHIEF CABINET SECRETARY NOBUTAKA MACHIMURA, March 14, at a news conference: "The prime minister will consider the BOJ selection carefully as he knows that a (policy) vacuum cannot be created." "I expect concrete steps will have to wait until the start of next week." AKIHIRO OTA, HEAD OF JUNIOR RULING COALITION PARTNER NEW KOMEITO, March 14, at a news conference: "Ultimately, it is the government's decision and we think Muto is fine. But the rejection by the upper house should be taken very seriously." ECONOMICS MINISTER HIROKO OTA, March 14, at a news conference: "Above all things, I want them not to leave the seat vacant. A central bank governor is important not only for Japan but also for the world and global markets." "Especially now, central banks are trying to work together to overcome the turmoil in financial markets, so I really want to ask them not to leave it vacant." KENJI YAMAOKA, PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS CHIEF OF THE MAIN OPPOSITION DEMOCRATIC PARTY, March 13, speaking to reporters after meeting his counterpart from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, Tadamori Oshima: "We have agreed that it is desirable to avoid a policy vacuum, even just for one day. "We also agreed to ask the government to put forward a new candidate by March 17." He quoted Oshima as saying a change in the BOJ Law may be proposed. "They didn't give me specific names at the meeting." PRIME MINISTER YASUO FUKUDA, March 13, speaking to reporters: "It is not good to be unable to reach a decision on the BOJ leadership when there are issues such as currency moves." Asked how he will deal with the political row and whether the government will pick a new nominee for BOJ chief: "I did not have much time to think about it as I was attending the budget committee and plenary session of parliament today, but I have time until the end of this week so I would like to think about it thoroughly. "I would like to think about it tomorrow and the day after tomorrow while listening to opinions from many people." Asked about the possibility of revising the law governing the BOJ to avoid a policy vacuum when Fukui retires: "I think there are various opinions. I don't want to create any policy vacuum." DEMOCRATIC PARTY EXECUTIVE NAOTO KAN, March 13, news conference: "It's not the upper and lower houses that decide (the governor). It is the government that nominates the governor. If the candidate cannot get approval, the government should come up with someone else. I don't think there is any other way. Asked if there is an option to extend Fukui's term beyond March 19 to avoid a policy vacuum: "I don't know whether it is possible under the BOJ Law to extend the five-year term, for instance, by about two months. I haven't done research on the matter yet." CHIEF CABINET SECRETARY MACHIMURA, March 13, in news conferences: "I wanted them to discuss whether Muto was appropriate as BOJ governor based on his views expressed at the hearings. It was regrettable because they made their decision simply because he was a finance ministry bureaucrat ... "We've been working through various channels to start talking (with the Democrats). We have to avoid a policy vacuum. "Renominating (Muto) is one option but there are other options too."
