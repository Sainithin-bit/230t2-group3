 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - The euro's rise against the dollar is a "serious issue" but European Union leaders will not discuss any new action on it at a summit on Friday, EU president Slovenia said. 

 Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Jansa told reporters on arriving to chair the final session of a two-day summit: "This is a serious issue but we won't get involved into details about it during this European Council meeting. "Our colleagues, the finance ministers, addressed this issue quite properly during their last meeting and we won't add anything," he said after the euro slipped slightly from Thursday's high above $1.56.
