 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve Board said on Friday it unanimously approved a new funding arrangement for Bear Stearns and Co and pledged to continue to pump liquidity into the U.S. financial system. 

 "The Federal Reserve is monitoring market developments closely and will continue to provide liquidity as necessary to promote the orderly functioning of the financial system," The Fed said in a statement. "The Board voted unanimously to approve the arrangement announced by JP Morgan Chase ( JPM.N ) and Bear Stearns BSC.N this morning." JPMorgan Chase and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on Friday agreed to provide emergency financing to Bear Stearns after the investment bank said its cash position had deteriorated sharply. For more, see nN14389680 Bear Stearns shares fell nearly 40 percent after news of the financing, the latest in the Fed's efforts to soothe increasingly fearful financial markets. "Our liquidity position in the last 24 hours had significantly deteriorated. We took this important step to restore confidence in us in the marketplace, strengthen our liquidity and allow us to continue normal operations," said Bear Stearns Chief Executive Alan Schwartz.
