 NEW DELHI  (Reuters) - India is not considering banning Research In Motion's RIM.TO RIMM.O BlackBerry services at this point of time, the top official in the telecoms ministry said on Friday. 

 Security agencies have raised concerns the service posed a risk as emails sent using it could not be traced or intercepted. "There is no question of banning at this point," Telecoms Secretary Siddhartha Behura told reporters on the sidelines of an industry conference. "We are not interested that we say BlackBerry will not used in this country," he said, adding the telecoms department was "very keen" the services should continue. "The interactions are going on with various stakeholders including the home ministry ... I do believe it will be resolved," Telecoms Minister Andimuthu Raja said. The department of telecoms has told RIM officials of the concerns and on Friday evening will meet representatives of the four mobile phone service providers who offer BlackBerry in India, Behura said. Sector leader Bharti Airtel Ltd ( BRTI.BO ), No. 2 Reliance Communications Ltd ( RLCM.BO ), Vodafone Plc- ( VOD.L ) controlled Vodafone Essar Ltd and privately held BPL Mobile provide the service in India. "We want operators to talk to BlackBerry people and put pressure on them to provide the necessary and satisfactory answers to security agencies. That is what we are talking to them," Behura said.
