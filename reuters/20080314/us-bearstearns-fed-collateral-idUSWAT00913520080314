 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The ultimate size of Federal Reserve efforts to prop up investment bank Bear Stearns are uncertain and depend on the ability of the firm to provide collateral for credit, senior Fed staff said on Friday. 

 The size will depend on the credit needs of the firm and whether it has collateral to meet those needs, staff told Reuters. The credit extensions have to be collateralized to the satisfaction of the Federal Reserve, the staff said. (Reporting by  Mark Felsenthal , editing by Dave Zimmerman)
