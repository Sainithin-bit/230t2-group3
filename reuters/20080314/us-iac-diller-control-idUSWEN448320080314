 WILMINGTON, Delaware  (Reuters) - IAC/InterActiveCorp Chairman Barry Diller on Thursday said he would be interested in acquiring a controlling stake in IAC if he could. 

 Diller made his comments during testimony in a trial over the future of the Internet conglomerate. Asked in Delaware Chancery Court whether he would be interested in trying to seek control of IAC, Diller said "Yes, if I could." "I don't know how far I would get," he said. "I'm not sure the number of shares I would need to acquire I would (actually) obtain," he told the court. IAC and its controlling shareholder Liberty Media have sued each other over Diller's plan to spin off four of IAC's largest businesses. Diller also referred to Liberty CEO Greg Maffei as a "irresponsible executive" who would not benefit IAC if he took an operating role there.
