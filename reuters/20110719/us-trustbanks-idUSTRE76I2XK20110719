 BOSTON  (Reuters) - State Street Corp ( STT.N ) and Bank of New York Mellon ( BK.N ), two of the world's biggest custody banks, each reported stronger second-quarter earnings as new demand for their products boosted revenue. 

 Both banks faced questions around rising expenses, however, and State Street's shares were down 5 percent in morning trading at $40.74 after it said it plans to eliminate 530 technology jobs in coming years and outsource others -- its second major round of layoffs since November. "Most of the concern on (State Street's) quarterly numbers has to do with expenses," said RBC analyst Gerard Cassidy. During the quarter, expenses rose 20 percent on an operating basis, fueled by a 22 percent increase in salaries and employee benefits. Bank of New York Mellon's shares were flat in morning trading. Chief Executive Robert Kelly said the bank will continue moving jobs from New York and Boston to lower-cost areas and will outline more cost-cutting details at an investor conference in the autumn. New York-based Bank of New York Mellon said on Tuesday net income climbed 12 percent to $735 million, while Boston-based State Street's earnings rose 19 percent to $513 million. Each company earned more in investment management fees for overseeing trillions of dollars in assets for pension funds and other large clients. Bank of New York Mellon saw a 14 percent gain while State Street reported a 24 percent gain. Some of the fee increases were fueled by acquisitions. Bank of New York Mellon last year signed a deal to buy PNC Financial Services Group Inc's global-investment services business, while State Street acquired the Bank of Ireland's asset management business in January. State Street reported a 15 percent gain in assets under management to $2.1 trillion. Bank of New York reported a 22 percent gain to $1.3 trillion. Assets under custody climbed 19.6 percent to $22.8 trillion at State Street and rose 21 percent to $26.3 trillion at Bank of New York Mellon. Nomura analyst Glenn Schorr praised Bank of New York Mellon's strong new business trends and "very significant deposit growth." But the companies still face pressure from low interest rates, which have forced them to waive money market fees, and lower trading volatility, which cut foreign exchange revenue. State Street's foreign exchange trading revenue dropped 9 percent while it fell 25 percent at Bank of New York Mellon. Pension funds have accused both companies of cheating customers on currency trading by failing to execute trades at the lowest rates. Each bank has denied wrongdoing in the past and neither gave new details in their earnings releases on the matter. Both however mentioned that they will likely face rising legal and regulatory costs in the months ahead. (Reporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Ross Kerber; Editing by  Derek Caney  and Maureen Bavdek)
