 CHARLOTTE, North Carolina  (Reuters) - Two of the largest U.S. consumer banks said on Tuesday they expect new limits on debit card fees to have less of an impact than originally projected, after regulators softened the rules. 

 Bank of America Corp and Wells Fargo & Co both lowered their estimates during second-quarter earnings results for the revenue hit they expect from the so-called Durbin Amendment. The rule -- which caps the fees that banks can charge merchants for processing debit card transactions -- was a key provision of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law passed last year. BofA, the largest U.S. bank by assets, said it expects a $475 million quarterly reduction in card revenue -- or $1.9 billion annually. That figure is lower than the $2 billion annualized loss BofA initially projected, absent any other efforts to recover lost revenue. San Francisco-based Wells Fargo said the change should cost the bank $250 million per quarter, down from a $325 million estimate earlier this year. The banks revised their estimates due to an unexpected increase in the proposed rate set by the Federal Reserve for interchange fees. Late last year, the Fed proposed a 12 cents-per-transaction cap. That limit was then raised after a public comment period to 21 cents per transaction on June 29. The financial industry fought the initial limit, arguing banks could not make up their costs of providing debit card services at that rate. At BofA's investor day in March, Joe Price, BofA's consumer bank chief, said the industry could lose $12 billion to $14 billion in annual revenue under the initial rule. Most of the large U.S. banks have since announced account fees and other charges for consumers to make up for the lost interchange revenue.
