 LONDON, Jul  (Reuters) - The clock is ticking inexorably toward Thursday's summit and if it does not come up with at least the framework for a second Greek bailout, markets are likely to react badly, not least because the threat of a U.S. default still hangs heavy too. 

 The choreography appears to be that euro zone policymakers are waiting for the banks, under the auspices of the IIF, to produce their part of the plan and then frantic work will be done to bash it into a broader political deal (probably by sherpas on Wednesday and through the night). The banks seem to be rowing behind some form of hit on Greek holdings and deeper analysis of the data from Friday's stress tests suggests, that while some will take a sizeable loss, the problem for non-Greek banks would be manageable. The roadblocks remain the same: first and foremost the ECB, which says it will not accept any defaulted bonds as collateral, throwing the onus on national governments to prevent Greek banks collapsing by keeping the liquidity taps on. It should be noted that the ECB has folded before, most notably on its bond-buying program, but Trichet so far sounds pretty implacable. However, the ECB is not speaking with one voice - Nowotny is out this morning saying proposals that would only lead to a short-term "selective default" should be examined. Trichet has only about three months of his term to run and his successor, Draghi, has tonally sounded somewhat less hardline. But the assumption has to be that the Frenchman remains firmly in charge - though our ECB team should continue to test this. Could his colleagues go to him and force a change of course? The favored options remain to buy back Greek bonds via the EFSF or swap them for longer maturities, maybe both, which would almost certainly be viewed as a limited default and would require national parliaments to vote on changes to the rescue fund's mandate (far from guaranteed and time-consuming in any event). So last-minute gambits such as a tax on euro area banks to raise about 30 billion euros over three years have been thrown onto the table, which would be levied on banks regardless of their exposure to Greece, though that could only be in addition to a bond swap or buyback program and while it would hit the banks, would do little for Greece's plight. If you glance back to what was ruled out in the past and is clearly not ruled out now, it's pretty instructive. All of which leads wiser heads than mine to wonder whether this crisis is only over when the bloc's leaders agree to the euro zone bond, something which, for now, remains strictly off limits for the Germans and others. That will not be on Thursday's agenda! At least Merkel is definitely turning up to the summit now. She clearly needs to begin work on selling this new package to a German public which is anything but supportive. She conspicuously didn't do so in her big setpiece interview on German TV over the weekend. The threat of contagion remains the most serious concern for the bloc. Italian and Spanish 10-year yields have leapfrogged six percent and a Spanish T-bill auction today is our latest litmus test of that. (writing by Mike Peacock)
