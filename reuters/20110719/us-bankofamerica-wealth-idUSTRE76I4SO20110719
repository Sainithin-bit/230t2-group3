 LONDON  (Reuters) - Bank of America is to stop managing money for wealth management clients outside 20 core regions in an efficiency drive that will lead to a 3 percent reduction in non-US assets under management, a spokeswoman at the company said. 

 Bank of America, the world's largest wealth manager by assets following its tie up with Merrill Lynch during the financial crisis, will concentrate operations in 20 regions covering 77 countries, the spokeswoman said. The refocus will apply only to its international wealth management operations and the bank's core U.S. business, representing the bulk of assets under management, will not be affected, she added. BofA's wealth management business, which continues to use the Merrill Lynch brand, runs around $1.5 trillion in total assets for its clients, the spokeswoman said. She would not disclose how much of the total was attributed to the international, non-U.S. business. However, an industry analyst who asked to remain anonymous said the assets due to come under new management could amount to several billion dollars. "We're redefining and transforming our international wealth management business to serve clients more effectively, concentrating our global client footprint, refocusing our resources and assets on target markets and economies," the spokeswoman said. Wealth managers continue to struggle with a squeeze on profitability in the wake of the financial crisis. Many have suffered the double challenge of rising regulatory costs as authorities tighten the rules, alongside risk averse clients keeping more money in low risk -- and low margin -- investments or cash. Bank of America on Tuesday reported its biggest-ever quarterly loss of $8.8 billion, reflecting charges from the settlement of a raft of mortgage related issues and lending margins squeezed by low interest rates. A recent survey by specialist consultancy Scorpio Partnership identified BofA as the world's largest wealth manager by assets, followed by Morgan Stanley and UBS. (Editing by  David Holmes )
