 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Apple Inc shares are rallying in after-market activity following its strong earnings report and are poised to break $400 on Wednesday, which would be an all-time high for the stock. 

 Here are a handful of facts about Apple's stock: - The shares closed at $376.85 on July 19 but reached a high of $405 in after-hours trading. Based on a price of $400, it would have a market capitalization of $369.90 billion, putting it within shouting distance of Exxon Mobil, the largest company in the Standard & Poor's 500 index, which has a $411.97 billion market value. - Based on that capitalization, Apple is now worth $7.93 million for every one of its 46,600 employees. - Year-to-date, its shares have gained 16.8 percent. The stock has had only two "down" years in the last 10: in 2002, when it lost 35 percent, and in 2008, when it dropped 57 percent. - It is now worth $116 billion more than Microsoft Corp and $154 billion more than Google Inc. - CEO Steve Jobs now owns $1.78 billion of Apple stock, based on last available filings showing him with 5.55 million shares as of December 17, 2010. If the share price surpasses $400, his stake would be valued at about $2.2 billion. Source: Thomson Reuters (Reporting by  David Gaffen ; Editing by  Richard Chang )
