 BERLIN  (Reuters) - Germany's finance ministry said on Tuesday that talks between euro zone governments and private creditors over a second bailout package for Greece were going ahead in a "constructive" manner. 

 But finance ministry spokesman Martin Kotthaus told Reuters that he would not give further details on the talks. Leaders of the 17 euro zone countries are due to meet on Thursday to agree on the new Greek package but no consensus has so far emerged on how the private sector will participate. "The talks are going ahead in an intensive and constructive manner," he said. "But we won't give a running commentary." (Reporting by  Gernot Heller ; writing by  Stephen Brown )
