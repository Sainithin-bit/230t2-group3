 Jul (Reuters) - ATHENS, July 19  (Reuters) - Greeks can feel safe about their country's banking system as stress tests showed it is adequately capitalized, the head of the European Banking Authority (EBA) told a Greek newspaper on Tuesday. "Greek banks, even under the most adverse scenario, show a capital adequacy that is 2.44 billion euros ($3.45 billion) bigger relative to the threshold that has been set (Core Tier 1 ratio of 5.0 percent)," EBA Chairman Andrea Enria told Kathimerini newspaper. Two Greek banks -- ATEbank and EFG EUrobank -- failed the European stress test last week scoring Core Tier 1 ratios below 5 percent under the simulation's adverse scenario. Enria told the paper that countries under financial EU/IMF financial support should worry less as their rescue package sets aside funds to deal with any potential problems in their banking systems. In Greece, authorities have set up the Financial Stability Fund (FSF) which is to be funded with 10 billion euros. (Reporting by George Georgiopoulos; Editing by Richard Borsuk)
