 BOSTON  (Reuters) - State Street Corp ( STT.N ), one of the world's biggest institutional investors, said it would eliminate as many 850 jobs from its technology unit as it tries to curb costs. 

 The company said that 530 positions will be eliminated outright and another 320 technology jobs will be outsourced to IBM ( IBM.N ) and Wipro Technologies ( WIT.N ). Most of the job cuts will occur in North America. This is the second time in less than a year that State Street announced job cuts. In November the company said it would eliminate 1,400 positions by the end of this year. The company employs 4,000 people in its technology department worldwide. The announcement came on the same day that State Street reported higher quarterly earnings but also said that its expenses had ticked higher. On an operating basis, expenses climbed 20 percent, fueled by a 22 percent jump in salaries and employee benefits. The company's share price was down 2.8 percent, or $1.16, at $41.79 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange. State Street will take a charge of as much as $130 million in the second half of 2011 to pay for the job cuts. The total restructuring costs will result in charges of between $400 million and $450 million over four years, the company said. (Reporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss; Editing by  Derek Caney )
