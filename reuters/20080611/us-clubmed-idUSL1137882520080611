 PARIS  (Reuters) - French holiday resort operator Club Mediterranee ( CMIP.PA ) is trading well and will be profitable in the current fiscal year, its chief executive told Le Figaro newspaper. 

 His comments came after Club Med announced earlier this week that it would sell its Jet Tours unit to Thomas Cook ( TCG.L ) for 70 million euros ($108.9 million) and sell 80 percent of its Club Med Gym to 21 Centrale Partners in a deal that valued it at 74 million euros. "These two transactions will largely compensate the few real estate deals in the first half and ensure that we have a net positive result for the year 2007-2008," Henri Giscard d'Estaing told Le Figaro in an interview published on Wednesday. Club Med, whose fiscal year ends October31, is upgrading its resorts in an effort to boost margins and bookings. "We are winning new customers and satisfaction levels are at a record level," Giscard d'Estaing said. "Our operations are progressing well and our profitability is satisfactory." He said the group planned to use 100 million euros proceeds from the two latest transactions to strengthen its balance sheet and finance the refurbishing of holiday villages and the construction of new ones.
