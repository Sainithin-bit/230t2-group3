 ST. LOUIS  (Reuters) - St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said on Wednesday there had been a deterioration in U.S. inflation expectations, but he did not think this reflected an increase in wage demands. 

 "I think...we have seen a ratcheting up of inflation expectations. I'm not sure what the correlation would be with labor costs," he told a conference hosted by Macroeconomic Advisers, a private economic forecasting firm. He also favored the idea of the central bank adopting a point inflation target to help anchor inflation expectations, and criticized some of his Fed colleagues for talking about vague 'comfort zones'. "I would be an advocate of precision. Pick a number and stick to it. I've never understood the zone thing...that introduces a lot of uncertainty...I don't understand how we got into the comfort zone thing," he said.
