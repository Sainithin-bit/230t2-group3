 TAIPEI/SEOUL  (Reuters) - HSBC ( HSBA.L ) said on Wednesday it might consider pulling out of a $6.3 billion deal to buy Korea Exchange Bank (KEB), a move analysts say would heap more pressure on South Korean regulators. 

 The comments were the second time in as many weeks that Europe's biggest bank has warned it would not wait forever for South Korean authorities to decide on the deal, which is seen as a major test of the country's openness to foreign investors. "The comment is seen intended to pressure regulatory authorities," said Lee Byung-gun at Shinyoung Securities. "HSBC cannot drag its feet on the deal indefinitely, which will increase uncertainties for the bank. Now we cannot rule out HSBC scrapping the deal, based on today's comment." HSBC ( 0005.HK ) had already extended an April deadline on its offer to buy a majority stake in the sixth-largest bank in South Korea 004940.KS from U.S. investment fund Lone Star LS.UL by three months to the end of July. The deal has been held up by lengthy legal wrangling over Lone Star's purchase of KEB in 2003 and its involvement in controversial decisions by the South Korean bank. "It's an acquisition we would like to complete, but it's up to regulatory approval," Sandy Flockhart, chief executive for HSBC Asia Pacific, told foreign media in Taipei on Wednesday. "If nothing happens, we'll find ourselves in a position to pull out. The board will have to consider that position." HSBC's Hong Kong-listed shares ( 0005.HK ) climbed 0.9 percent on Wednesday, outperforming the broader market's  .HSI  0.3 percent gain. Korea Exchange Bank's shares were down 3.0 percent at 14,550 won by 1:43 a.m. EDT, lagging the broader market's 0.5 percent gain. Flockhart's comments come about two weeks after similar remarks by the bank's head of South Korean operations. "We have been in this Korean deal for a long time. We are patient," said Flockhart. Seoul's High Court is due to give a verdict to Lone Star and the head of its South Korean operations next Tuesday, after a lower court found both guilty in February of manipulating the stock price of a credit card unit of KEB so it could buy it cheaply. South Korean analysts speculate the appeal court ruling might clear the way for either regulators or Lone Star to make a final decision. South Korea's new government under Korean President Lee Myung-bak has said that it sees the deal as a litmus test of its pledge to open up Asia's fourth-largest economy far wider to foreign investors. But analysts say recent mass protests against the government, sparked by public outcry over a deal to widen its market to U.S. beef imports, have all but blocked President Lee's plans for sweeping economic reforms, including tax cuts and the sell-off of major state-run firms and banks. Shares in KEB fell as much as 3.7 percent at one point on Wednesday, but pared losses on expectations that an HSBC withdrawal would result in a bidding war from other domestic lenders such as Kookmin 060000.KS. "If the deal indeed falls apart, Lone Start will have to find yet another buyer, which I think will likely to be either Kookmin or Hana Financial Group ( 086790.KS )," said Park Jung-hyun, an analyst at Hanwha Securities. Kookmin confirmed again its strong interest in KEB on Wednesday, while KEB hopes HSBC will become its new majority shareholder. "We still firmly believe that the HSBC deal will be the best choice for the future of KEB," KEB said. Lone Star's representatives in Seoul declined to comment.
