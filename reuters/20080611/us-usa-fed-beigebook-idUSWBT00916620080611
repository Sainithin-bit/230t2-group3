 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. businesses have faced rising costs in recent weeks but retailers have had only "mixed results" trying to raise selling prices with the economy still weak, the Federal Reserve said in a report on Wednesday. 

 "Business contacts in most districts reported increases in input prices ... especially prices for energy, petroleum derivatives, metals, plastics, chemicals, and food," the Fed said in its Beige Book summary of economic conditions. The report said manufacturers reported "some ability" to pass along their higher production costs to their customers, but suggested the heightened price pressures had not ignite a broad consumer inflation. "Retailers reported mixed results with respect to raising final goods prices," the report said. The anecdotal report, based on an informal survey of the Fed's contacts across the nation, said economic activity was generally weak in late April and through June 2, the period covered by the report. The Fed has lowered interest rates to 2 percent from 5.25 percent since mid-September to brace an economy slammed by a housing-market collapse and credit crunch. But the upward march of energy and other commodity prices has triggered inflation worries and raised expectations the central bank's next step may be to increase interest rates to relieve price pressures. The Beige Book "is upping a notch the concerns about inflation," Scott Brown, chief economist with Raymond James & Associates in St. Petersburg, Florida. The report painted a vivid picture of a shaky economy plagued by rising prices for energy, food, and some other raw materials. Fed districts described economic activity as "softer, weaker, or lower," or "slower, sluggish, or modest." At the same time, consumer spending slowed as incomes were "pinched" by rising energy and food prices, the Fed said. Manufacturing was "soft," and residential real estate markets remained "weak," the report added. At the same time, pressure to raise workers' wages was moderate or limited, although hiring was "spotty," the Fed said. One New England contact told officials business is "the worst I have ever seen." While the Fed is expected to hold interest rates steady at its next meeting on June 24-25, markets expect the central bank to begin raising rates in September. (Editing by  Neil Stempleman )
