 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. consumers pared spending in recent weeks as they struggled under the weight of higher food and energy costs, limiting the ability of retailers to raise other prices, the Federal Reserve said on Wednesday. 

 The Fed's Beige Book, an anecdotal survey of economic conditions across the country, highlighted the pressures soaring commodity prices have put on producers, but suggested a broad inflationary surge had not taken hold. Separately, Fed officials kept up warnings about building pressure on prices and the possibility that a self-feeding inflationary psychology could emerge. Such warnings have led financial markets to price in a series of interest rate hikes later this year. "Any tendency for ... longer-term inflation expectations to drift higher or even fail to reverse over time would have troublesome implications for the outlook for inflation," said Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Donald Kohn. The Fed has lowered benchmark interest rates to 2 percent from 5.25 percent since mid-September to support an economy slammed by a housing market collapse and credit crunch. But the upward march of energy and other commodity prices has triggered a heightened focus on inflation, despite clear signs of U.S. economic weakness, including five straight months of job losses. The Beige Book, based on an informal survey of the Fed's contacts across the nation in late April and through June 2, noted businesses were paying more for raw materials. "Business contacts in most districts reported increases in input prices ... especially prices for energy, petroleum derivatives, metals, plastics, chemicals, and food," it said. While manufacturers reported "some ability" to pass along higher production costs to their customers, retail prices moved higher only in some parts of the country. "Retailers reported mixed results with respect to raising final goods prices," the report said. ADDRESSING INFLATION Fast-rising gasoline and food costs have led consumers to expect higher inflation down the road. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke on Monday said the Fed would "strongly resist" any increase in long-term inflation expectations. St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard said on Wednesday that after a period of low rates appropriate to help the economy navigate a deep housing downturn and a credit crunch, policy-makers needed to turn the focus to prices. "After a 10-month period in which the dominant policy concern has rightly been the state of financial markets, policy can begin to address pressing inflationary concerns during the remainder of the year," he said. "It is rule number one in modern central banking that inflation and inflation expectations be kept under control," Bullard added. Although Fed officials have made clear they have no plans to lower rates further, the economy remains on shaky ground. In the Beige Book, some of the Fed's 12 regional districts described economic activity as "softer, weaker or lower," while others said it was "slower, sluggish or modest." At the same time, the report said consumer spending slowed as incomes were "pinched" by rising energy and food prices. It also described manufacturing as "soft," and residential real estate markets as "weak." The Fed report found that pressure to raise workers' wages was moderate or limited while hiring was "spotty." One New England-based contact told central bank officials that business is "the worst I have ever seen." The Fed is expected to hold benchmark overnight rates steady at its next rate-setting on June 24-25, but financial markets have increasingly come to the view that borrowing costs will move higher before year-end. Futures markets see a rate increase as early as September. (Additional reporting by  Pedro Nicolaci da Costa  in Harwich, Massachusetts,  Alister Bull  in St. Louis; editing by Gary Crosse)
