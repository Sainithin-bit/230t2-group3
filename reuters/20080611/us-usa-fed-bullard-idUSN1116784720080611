 ST. LOUIS  (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve must start raising interest rates this year to keep inflation at bay, now that strains in the financial markets have eased, a top Fed official signaled on Wednesday. 

 "The probability of a very bad outcome from the financial crisis is receding and we've still got the low level of interest rates that we took out during that time period," St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard told reporters after a speech. "I see there being some inflationary consequences of that going forward if we don't take action and stay on top of this situation," he said. Bullard, not a voting member of the Fed's interest rate-setting committee in 2008, stressed in earlier remarks that imminent hikes were not warranted until later this year. "My view is that policy is appropriately calibrated at this time, given the current economic environment and the outlook for the next 18 months," Bullard told a conference hosted by Macroeconomic Advisers, a private forecasting firm. "After a 10-month period in which the dominant policy concern has rightly been the state of financial markets, policy can begin to address pressing inflationary concerns during the remainder of the year," he said in remarks that echoed parts of a speech he delivered on June 6. The Fed has slashed interest rates 3.25 percentage points since September to shield the U.S. economy from a housing crisis that sparked a global credit crunch. Bullard said that now that the sense of market panic was easing, it was time for the Fed to concentrate on inflation. "It is rule number one in modern central banking that inflation and inflation expectations be kept under control," he said in the speech. The remarks echo other recent hawkish contributions from Fed policy-makers and Bullard said that if the tone of the central bank's rhetoric had shifted, it was because the sense that markets could really suffer a meltdown had faded. He declined to say where he felt the 'neutral' level lay for the Fed's benchmark funds rate, although he said they were clearly negative at 2 percent. Neutral is a theoretical description of the level at which Fed rates are neither boosting nor hindering economic expansion. It matters because policymakers, when considering taking back policy easings, might want to have this in mind as a target. Bullard also stressed that the Fed should take little comfort from readings on core inflation, which strips out soaring energy and food prices and are much lower compared with headline inflation. "Unless there are compelling reasons to do otherwise, policy has to focus on the prices actually faced by households and businesses," he said. Bullard said that although financial market turmoil had not completely abated, emergency measures by the Fed to boost liquidity appear to have gained traction and were helping markets return to normal. "I am cautiously optimistic that we can move into the second half of 2008 on firmer footing with reduced financial market turmoil, reduced drag from the housing sector, more rapid economic growth, and a renewed effort on keeping inflation low and stable," he said.
