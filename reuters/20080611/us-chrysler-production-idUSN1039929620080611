 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Chrysler LLC may cut production further amid a steep drop in truck sales, according to a Wall Street Journal online report citing an interview with Chief Executive Robert Nardelli on Tuesday. 

 According to the story, Nardelli said on the sidelines of the Journal's "Deals and DealMakers" conference that Chrysler "may have to go back and resize" production again after May U.S. sales fell 25 percent from the year before due to a drop in sales of Dodge Ram pick ups. Cerberus Capital Management LP CBS.UL last August bought an 80.1 percent stake in Chrysler from former parent Daimler ( DAIGn.DE ) in a $7.4 billion deal.
