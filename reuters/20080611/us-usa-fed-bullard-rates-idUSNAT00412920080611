 ST. LOUIS  (Reuters) - St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said on Wednesday that interest rates of 2 percent were very low and could fuel inflation unless the U.S. central bank took action going forward. 

 "The easing that the Fed did in January and March was very sharp...some of which was viewed as insurance against the possibility of a very bad outcome from the financial crisis," he told reporters after delivering a speech. "The probability of a very bad outcome from the financial crisis is receding and we've still got the low level of interest rates...I see there being some inflationary consequences of that going forward, if we don't take action and stay on top of this situation," he said.
