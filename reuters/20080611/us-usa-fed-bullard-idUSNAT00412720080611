 ST. LOUIS  (Reuters) - U.S. Federal Reserve interest rates are appropriate for now but the central bank must begin turning its attention toward inflation, a top Fed policy-maker said on Wednesday, hinting at rate hikes to come. 

 "My view is that policy is appropriately calibrated at this time, given the current economic environment and the outlook for the next 18 months," said St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard, in prepared remarks that echoed parts of a speech he delivered on June 6. "After a 10-month period in which the dominant policy concern has rightly been the state of financial markets, policy can begin to address pressing inflationary concerns during the remainder of the year," he said. A copy of his remarks was released to the media prior to delivery.
