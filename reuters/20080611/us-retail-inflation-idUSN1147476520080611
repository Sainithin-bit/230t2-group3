 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Retailers may be able to offset rising costs this year and hold the line on prices, but in 2009 more retailers are likely to pass pricing increases along as inflationary pressures accelerate, Citigroup said on Wednesday. 

 Citigroup Global Markets analyst Deborah Weinswig said that, according to the latest data from April, import prices of apparel, footwear and household goods were up 2.1 percent year over year. "This compares with the period from December 1998 through February 2003, when import prices on this category of goods were fairly consistently down year over year each month," she wrote in a research note. Weinswig said that China and India, where many retailers source their goods, are experiencing the highest inflationary trends, driven by higher energy and raw material costs, rising labor costs, and a declining U.S. dollar. Meanwhile, skyrocketing energy prices are increasing the cost of making and transportation goods across the globe. "Each player along the retail supply chain will be impacted by product cost inflation, beginning with factories and spanning all the way up the supply chain to retailers (and even end-consumers)," she wrote. Manufacturers are likely to experience product cost inflation in the low- to mid-single digit range, she said, but she added that suppliers in China and India could experience inflationary pressures of 10 percent to 15 percent per year over the next several years. Meanwhile, retailers should see relatively little cost inflation on apparel components this year, but in footwear, the price increases could be closer to 10 percent due to higher leather costs, she said. PRICE HIKES AHEAD Consumers should see little cost increases in apparel this year at mid-market department stores like J.C. Penney Co Inc ( JCP.N ), Kohl's Corp ( KSS.N ), and Macy's Inc ( M.N ), and discounters Target Corp ( TGT.N ) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ), Weinswig said. High-end department stores like Nordstrom Inc ( JWN.N ) and Saks Inc SKS.N are already passing price increases along to their customers due to their more affluent status, she said. "Next year, we believe more retailers are likely to pass pricing increases along as inflationary pressures will accelerate by then." Of the companies Weinswig covers, she said Penney and Kohl's are best positioned in this environment. She cited Penney's extensive history of developing its own private brands, which has helped it form strong relationships with suppliers. "For 2008, J.C. Penney management believes that the company can hold apparel costs flat by shifting production from China to other countries," she wrote. Kohl's uses a third party sourcing agent, Li & Fung. "We believe that Li & Fung is probably willing to absorb some of the price inflation rather than passing all of it on to Kohl's, since Kohl's is one of their largest retail clients." But she said Macy's and Target "will be more negatively impacted by product cost inflation due to their relatively larger exposures to goods sourced from China." She said Macy's sources about 40 percent of its goods from China, while Target sources about 50 percent there. "We estimate that Macy's and Target's gross margins could each be negatively impacted by around (-50) basis points per year," she said, assuming low-single digit product cost inflation.
