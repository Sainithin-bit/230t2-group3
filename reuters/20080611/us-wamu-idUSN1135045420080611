 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Washington Mutual Inc ( WM.N ) on Wednesday denied what it called market rumors about regulatory activity after the shares fell more than 9 percent to a 16-year low. 

 "Neither our primary federal regulator, the OTS, nor any other bank regulatory agency has taken any enforcement action against WaMu that we have not previously discussed," the largest U.S. savings and loan said in a statement. The origin of the rumors was unclear, although Wamu has been hit by concern about losses on the bank's loan portfolio. On Tuesday, National City Corp NCC.N, a large U.S. Midwest regional bank, said it had entered into agreements with federal regulators concerning its asset quality and its ability to manage capital, risk and liquidity. Wamu, down 55 percent this year, is the worst performer among big U.S. bank stocks after Nat City, which has plunged 73 percent. Earlier, analysts and investors attributed the drop in Wamu shares to ongoing concerns about loan losses. "Finally you are starting to see some analysts really crunch the numbers on this story, and large institutional investors are out there believing it," said Les Childress, president of Childress Investment Research. "Everyone seems to be in the same direction, that the losses are going to be extensive." The company's shares fell 62 cents, or 9.3 percent, to close at $6.06 on the New York Stock Exchange, their lowest close since January 1992. The stock was the biggest decliner on the KBW banks index .BKX. "The company has said they will have some significant losses, and at the end of the day, no one knows how big those losses will be," said Blake Howells, director of equity research at Becker Capital Management in Portland, Oregon, with about $2.3 bln under management. "It makes Washington Mutual hard to value." Becker does not own Wamu shares. UBS AG analyst Eric Wasserstrom predicted earlier this week that WaMu could face losses of $27 billion in all asset classes through 2011. Wasserstrom had widened his full-year loss estimate for the thrift to $4.45 per share from $4 and cut his share-price target to $8.50 from $11. The forecast came after WaMu reported a first-quarter loss of $1.1 billion, triggered by its exposure to subprime mortgages, and sold a $7 billion stake to investors led by TPG Capital TPG.UL. In the capital plan, WaMu raised $1.54 billion from a sale of 176 million shares at $8.75 each. It also sold $5.5 billion of convertible preferred shares with an initial conversion price of $8.75. WaMu said this month it would strip Chief Executive Kerry Killinger of his title of chairman. For several months, shareholder activists had taken aim at Killinger and board members for not protecting the company from crippling losses. The latest sell-off -- WaMu's shares are down about 18 percent this week -- may be a further indication of shareholders' frustration, Childress said. "Perhaps they thought that if TPG came in that (it) would do something serious to protect their interest," Childress said. "By now (TPG) would have done something to turn over top management." Becker's Howells said financial stocks were under pressure on Wednesday. For example, FirstFed Financial Corp FED.N, parent of First Federal Bank of California, was down nearly 18 percent, and Downey Financial Corp ( DSL.N ), parent of Downey Savings and Loan Association, fell nearly 8 percent. "The market's becoming more bearish again on residential mortgage-type exposures," Howells said. (Reporting by  Paritosh Bansal ,  Dan Wilchins  and  Christian Plumb ; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
