 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc Chief Executive Susan Lyne is stepping down after nearly four years of navigating the lifestyle brand through quarterly losses and the brief imprisonment of its founder. 

 Martha Stewart Living said on Wednesday it will make two of its executives co-CEOs: Wenda Harris Millard, a former Yahoo Inc executive who now serves as president of media, and Robin Marino, president of merchandising. Shares of the media and merchandising network built by Martha Stewart fell 6 percent as some investors showed concern over a dual-CEO structure. "They are fairly rare and they typically don't work out to be that great," said Noble Financial research director Michael Kupinski, who rates the share a "buy." "But I can understand the reasoning behind it. The management team in place is very capable." The former head of entertainment at television network ABC, Lyne joined the company in late 2004 while Stewart served a five-month prison sentence over a suspicious stock sale. Stewart, 66, was barred from serving as a corporate officer with financial reporting and other duties for five years under a 2006 settlement with U.S. securities regulators. Lyne, once credited with spotting hit shows for ABC like "Desperate Housewives," was hired to stem a flight of advertisers at the Martha Stewart Living magazine, spruce up its television programming and expand its marketing partnerships. "Our principal goal was to rebuild the company and return it to profitability. We have done that," Lyne said in a statement on Wednesday. She gave no explanation for her departure and was not immediately available for comment. Media industry columnists and blogs have speculated that Lyne could vie for a top role at publisher Time Inc, among other jobs. NO SPLIT IN STORE In recent quarters, Martha Stewart Living reported improved advertising and growth for its websites. It has also taken steps to diversify its brand beyond Stewart's own tips for gracious living, including a deal with celebrity chef Emeril Lagasse. But investor concerns over future growth have weighed on company shares, which are off nearly 14 percent this year. The shares have fallen 57 percent since Lyne was named CEO, with much of that decline coming in the second half of 2007 due to concerns over a weakening U.S. economy and its toll on the publishing and retail businesses. David Kestenbaum, director of research at Morgan Joseph & Co, said investors had expected Millard might become CEO, but may have been surprised by the decision to divvy up the job. "(Chairman) Charles Koppelman is really the key there. I think he'll be more active," Kestenbaum said. "I liked what Susan was doing, but the overall retail environment is very difficult." Millard and Marino joined the company during Lyne's tenure, bringing their expertise in the areas of advertising and retail merchandising, respectively. Marino was previously president and chief operating officer at luxury designer Kate Spade Inc. Millard remains in charge of online, publishing and broadcasting operations while Marino oversees licensing partnerships with retailers such as Macy's and Kmart. Asked whether the choice of a co-CEO structure suggested the potential for eventually splitting the units, Koppelman said, "Absolutely not." "The stock price is undervalued by Wall Street, but not undervalued by Main Street," he said in an interview. Millard said in a joint interview that she and Marino already coordinate closely in running their respective segments of the company. "We saw an opportunity for even more collaboration," she said. Marino said, "The most valuable asset in the world is having a media platform residing next to me. Others in the merchandising world would die for it." Martha Stewart shares closed 48 cents lower at $7.50. (Editing by  Derek Caney , Phil Berlowitz)
