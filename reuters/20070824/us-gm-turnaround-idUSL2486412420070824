 ZURICH  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp.( GM.N ) was more than half way through with its turnaround plan, the car makers' Vice-Chairman told a Swiss newspaper in an interview. 

 "We have gone 60 percent of the way," Robert A. Lutz told Finanz und Wirtschaft according to a preprint of the interview released on Friday, a day ahead of the paper's publication. "GM is on track to achieve cost savings of $9 billion annually and to cut fixed costs from over 30 percent to 25 percent of sales," Lutz said. The three big U.S. car makers -- GM, Ford( F.N ) and Chrysler -- lost more than $15 billion on a combined basis in 2006 and are in the middle of restructuring plans that include closing more than two dozen plants and slashing more than 80,000 jobs. Lutz said the car market in the United States was in a cyclical low at the moment. "2007 is going to be the weakest year since 1998," he said. "Consumers are weakened after the downturn of the housing market und we are suffering because of that," he said. But Lutz said he was confident that GM was on the way to the top again. "In ten years, General Motors is going to be the world's largest and most profitable car maker," he told the newspaper.
