 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores ( WMT.N ) shares and options volatility ticked up on Friday on rumors that government-sponsored investment funds from China and Singapore may be eyeing the retailer's stock, U.S. and U.K. market sources said. 

 The moves are spurred by "unconfirmed chatter of an Asian investment by a new sovereign investment fund of the Chinese government and Temasek Holdings," said Paul Foster, options strategist for theflyonthewall.com in Chicago. A trader in London also said the rumor was circulating there. That trader, who declined to be named, said there is speculation that one or both of the Asian funds may buy about $8 billion of Wal-Mart shares in open-market purchases. That would represent about a 4 percent stake based on Wal-Mart's market capitalization Friday of about $179 billion. "At this point it remains speculation, and we wouldn't be able to comment on it," Wal-Mart Spokesman John Simley said. Wal-Mart shares were up 1.2 percent at $43.68 at midday on Friday in moderate volume. In options activity, Wal-Mart's implied volatility, a measure of the expected magnitude of near-term share price movements, was signaled at 26, above its 26-week moving average of 22, Foster said. That suggests greater risk of price swings. Call options giving the right to buy Wal-Mart shares at $45 by September 21 were the busiest series on the day, with 3,716 contracts traded by midday, according to Reuters data. That is below the average volume over the past 10 days for that series of about 5,386 contract. The September 45s last traded at 47 cents a contract, up 7 cents from Thursday's close. Markets have been rife with periodic rumors about where the Asian funds, China's in particular, will invest their vast reserves. China last spring set up a special investment arm to diversify its holdings away from government securities, such as U.S. Treasuries. The fund, estimated by Chinese state media to be managing about $200 billion, made big headlines in May when it struck a deal for a $3 billion stake in Blackstone Group ( BX.N ) just before the U.S. investment firm's initial public offering. Temasek Holdings TEM.UL, a state-sponsored fund of Singapore, has a wide range of significant minority stakes in companies worldwide. Last month it took at $2 billion stake in Barclays Plc ( BARC.L ) in conjunction with the British bank's bid for Dutch bank ABN AMRO AAH.AS.
