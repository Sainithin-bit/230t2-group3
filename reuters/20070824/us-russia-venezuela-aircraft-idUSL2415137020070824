 MOSCOW  (Reuters) - Russian state arms exporter Rosoboronexport denied media reports on Friday that it had signed a deal to sell 98 Ilyushin civilian aircraft to Venezuela. 

 The Vremya-Novostei newspaper reported that Rosoboronexport chief Sergei Chemezov had signed the deal for the Ilyushin-114 planes, which can be used as passenger and cargo planes. Izvestia newspaper also reported the deal and said it could be worth several billion U.S. dollars. But in a statement posted on its Web site (www.rosoboronexport.ru) the trader said: "Rosoboronexport's press service is authorized to announce that information published in the Russian media about a contract signed between Rosoboronexport and Venezuela to deliver 98 Il-114 aircraft is not true." Russia said last year it had sold 24 Sukhoi jets and 53 helicopters to Venezuela as part of a long-term package of arms contracts worth over $3 billion. Details were not disclosed. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez visited Russia in June when he thanked President Vladimir Putin for showing solidarity in Venezuela's feud with Washington. Chavez is a vocal critic of what he calls U.S. imperialism. Washington considers him a dangerous radical and had urged Russia to rethink the weapons sale. It bans American companies from selling weapons to Venezuela. Russia has been seeking to break into new markets for arms and aircraft sales in Latin America, southeast Asia and north Africa. Its main customers for arms are India and China.
