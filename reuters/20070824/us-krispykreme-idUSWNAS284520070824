 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Krispy Kreme Doughnuts Inc ( KKD.N ) said on Friday that it is realigning its franchise and company store operations, a move that should help the company improve sales at existing locations and cut costs. 

 The company said the changes will mainly affect a support center in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Jeff Welch will become senior vice president and general manager of global franchise operations and development and Steve Lineberger will become senior vice president and general manager of U.S. company operations. Executive Vice President of Operations Jeff Jervik decided to leave Krispy Kreme to return to his private business interests as of September 1, the company said.
