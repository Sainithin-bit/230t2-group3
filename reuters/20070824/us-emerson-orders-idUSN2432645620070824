 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Diversified U.S. manufacturer Emerson Electric Co ( EMR.N ) reported on Friday that orders rose 5 percent to 10 percent for the three months ended in July, continuing its earlier trend. 

 In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the maker of products ranging from factory efficiency systems to motors and tools said the strongest growth in the three-month period came at its network power unit, where orders were up 20 percent. Orders were up 15 percent at the process management unit and 10 percent in industrial automation. Orders at the climate technologies and appliance and tool units were flat to down 5 percent. The St. Louis-based company said favorable currency exchange rates boosted overall orders by about 3 percent.
