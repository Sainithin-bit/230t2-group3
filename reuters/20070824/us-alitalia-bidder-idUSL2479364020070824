 ROME  (Reuters) - U.S. private equity firm TPG TPG.UL is still interested in bidding for loss-making airline Alitalia AZPIa.MI and is waiting to see what conditions management puts on the sale, a source close to TPG said on Friday. 

 Italian financial daily Il Sole 24 Ore said TPG had lost interest in Alitalia. TPG is also leading a group of potential bidders for Spanish airline Iberia IBLA.MC, which include British Airways BAY.L and some Spanish firms. The source said TPG's interest in Alitalia was "not incompatible" with its pursuit of Iberia. Italy's government in July had to call off its seven-month long auction for Alitalia -- worth about 1.2 billion euros ($1.6 billion) -- after all bidders pulled out citing restrictive conditions. The Italian state, which is trying to shed its 49.9 percent controlling stake, has since handed responsibility for finding a buyer to Alitalia's management, which is scheduled to meet next week on its future. All the final contenders in the failed auction -- TPG and fellow U.S. private equity firm MatlinPatterson, Russian airline Aeroflot ( AFLT.MM ) and smaller Italian carrier Air One -- have said they could be interested again if Italy relaxed the terms of the sale -- which included protecting the airline's national identity and jobs. TPG has in the past asked for the freedom to talk to Alitalia's strike-prone unions before making a binding offer, people familiar with the situation have said. Alitalia -- which lost 626 million euros last year -- almost certainly needs more cash to survive just as Brussels blocks any more state bailouts. It said this week it had been contacted by a new, mystery group of investors -- mostly Italian -- which expressed an interest in the carrier. The group, represented by lawyer Antonio Baldassarre who has refused to name its members, has optimistic plans which include no cuts in jobs and more flight routes for the company -- whose jewel is a virtual monopoly on the busy Rome to Milan commute. UniCredit ( CRDI.MI ), the Italian banking giant that had backed Aeroflot's suit, said on Friday Alitalia had received so much state aid that it was now incapable of standing on its own. "Alitalia will disappear as an Italian company. By ... help and more help, the company is no longer capable of surviving," UniCredit Chief Executive Alessandro Profumo said at a conference in Rimini. Alitalia shares closed down 0.3 percent at 0.84 euros, as the overall Milan market .MIBTEL gained 0.6 percent.
