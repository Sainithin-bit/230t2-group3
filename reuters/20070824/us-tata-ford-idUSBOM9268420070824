 MUMBAI  (Reuters) - India's Tata Group is interested in acquiring Ford Motor Co's ( F.N ) Jaguar and Land Rover brands, the Indian conglomerate's chairman Ratan Tata said in remarks released on Friday. 

 "We certainly have some interest in it," he told the CNBC TV18 television channel in an interview that is yet to be aired in full. In excerpts of the interview shown by the channel, Tata said the acquisition would make Tata Motors ( TAMO.BO )( TTM.N ) less dependent on just one market. "It will give us more of a global presence," he said, but would not be drawn further on the group's interest. The full interview will be aired in two parts on Sunday and Monday. Ford said earlier this week it planned to have more details on the sale of Jaguar and Land Rover by the end of 2007 or early 2008. A source familiar with the matter told Reuters in July that Tata Motors Ltd and India's Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd ( MAHM.BO ), as well as U.S. buyout firms TPG TPG.UL and Ripplewood were among those who had expressed interest in a possible bid for the premium brands. Tata also reiterated the small car that Tata Motors is developing would be launched in the first half of the fiscal year to March 2009, and that it would be priced at 100,000 rupees ($2,400). "We are working towards the price ... We don't want to comment on whether it is the ex-factory or on-road price," he said in the interview. "It will meet all safety, emission and crash testing standards," he said.
