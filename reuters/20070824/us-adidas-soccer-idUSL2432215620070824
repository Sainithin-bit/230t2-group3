 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Germany's national soccer team will continue to wear Adidas ADSG.DE kit after rejecting a higher sponsorship deal from sport goods rival Nike ( NKE.N ). 

 The German football association (DFB) said on Friday it had agreed to a settlement in a supply dispute with Adidas. Nike offered 500 million euros ($678.4 million) to provide the German team's kit for eight years from 2011, an amount many times more than Adidas's deal. "German football has lost a great chance," a Nike spokesman in Germany said, He added Nike was not planning a legal challenge against the decision.
