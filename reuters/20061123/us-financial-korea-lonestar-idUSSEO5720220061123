 SEOUL  (Reuters) - U.S. buyout fund Lone Star said on Thursday it was ending an agreement to sell Korea Exchange Bank 004940.KS to Kookmin Bank 060000.KS in a $7.3 billion deal, which has been subject to a long-running prosecutor probe. 

 "We have concluded that we cannot move forward with the sale of KEB to Kookmin Bank due to the continuing investigations surrounding Lone Star's investment in KEB and KEB's subsequent rescue of its credit card subsidiary, which have been extended several times and now have no firm completion date," John Grayken, Chairman of Lone Star Funds LS.UL, said in a statement. A Kookmin official in charge of the deal declined to comment. KEB spokeswoman Lee Nam-yeon said: "We don't have much to say regarding the decision of our largest shareholder". Chae Dong-wook, an official at the Supreme Prosecutors' Office, told Reuters the announcement would not affect its ongoing investigations into KEB and Lone Star officials. The nine-month legal battle has led to the indictment of KEB and a Lone Star unit, and detention warrants against two Lone Star executives. The investigations, closely watched by foreign investors, centre on allegations that financial data on KEB was understated to help Lone Star buy the bank at a bargain price of $1.2 billion, against a backdrop of anti-foreign investor sentiment.
