 PARIS  (Reuters) - Pan-European stock exchange operator 
Euronext ENXT.PA said on Thursday it would ask shareholders 
to approve its planned merger with NYSE Group NYX.N, parent 
company of the New York Stock Exchange, at an extraordinary 
meeting on December 19. 

  "The supervisory board recommends that shareholders vote to 
approve (the) agreement and transactions," Euronext said in a 
statement.  It said full details of the agenda of the extraordinary 
shareholders meeting, to be held in Amsterdam, would be issued 
by December 1.  Euronext in June accepted a $10 billion takeover proposal 
by NYSE -- a deal which both companies say is a merger of 
equals.  Euronext must still obtain a green light for the deal from 
European regulators in countries where its businesses are 
based. French markets regulator AMF said on Thursday the 
rulings would be made by the start of December.  Euronext operates the Paris, Amsterdam, Lisbon and Brussels 
bourses as well as London's Euronext.Liffe derivatives market. 
It needs clearance from all the markets' regulators.  Euronext and NYSE plan to put management of the units under 
a Dutch foundation to keep them out of reach of U.S. 
regulations such as Sarbanes-Oxley.  Euronext said on Thursday it would also nominate Sylvain 
Hefes, chief executive of Paris Orleans ( PROR.PA ), a holding 
company of the Rothschild banking group, to serve on the board 
of the planned combined company NYSE Euronext.
