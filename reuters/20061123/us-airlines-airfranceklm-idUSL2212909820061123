 PARIS  (Reuters) - Air France KLM ( AIRF.PA ), under pressure from Rome to commit to a merger with Alitalia, announced exploratory talks with the ailing carrier on Thursday but reaffirmed conditions for a deal. 

 Chief Executive Jean-Cyril Spinetta, unveiling higher second-quarter operating results which contrasted with Alitalia's persistent losses, stressed the talks were at early stages and repeated demands for Alitalia AZPIa.MI to be privatized. But Air France KLM shares fell sharply on the mention of a merger that many analysts say could eat into profits at the world's largest airline by revenues, while Alitalia bounced higher in the latest round of bet-taking on a rescue deal. "At Alitalia's request, we have opened an exploratory phase of discussions," Spinetta told a results news conference. Air France KLM shares were down 7 percent at 30 euros by 1035 GMT, while Alitalia shares were up 2.8 percent at 0.9685 euros after rising more than 4 percent earlier on Thursday. In Rome, Alitalia said the exploratory talks with Air France KLM about a possible tie-up were not exclusive. It said it was looking for a partnership with a "sound" industrial basis. The disclosure of talks came as Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi prepared to raise concerns on the lack of progress at a Franco-Italian summit, and shortly after he challenged Air France KLM in a newspaper interview to take a clearer stand. "I have always supported contacts between the two groups. Now, I have a lot of doubts. I would like to know Air France's real intentions," Prodi told French daily Le Figaro. "Does it want to create a big European air transport group in which Italy has also its place, or simply to grab the Italian air transport market, which is big and very rich?" Prodi added. Some French commercial aviation officials welcomed Prodi's comments as they eased their fears that Air France KLM would be pushed into a quick merger with Alitalia. Investors took the opposite view, however, driving Air France KLM shares lower and Alitalia shares upwards. Air France KLM says it has always accepted the idea of a merger in principle, but will not do anything in practice until Alitalia has cleaned up its accounts and is free of what French officials regard as interference from its Italian state owner. ONE VISION? Spinetta said a merger with Alitalia was "possible" but would only happen if it created value. The talks will examine how soon Alitalia can halt its losses, whether they share the same vision and how much cash a merger would save, he said. A diplomatic source said Prodi would look into whether the struggling Italian airline could strike a deal with Air France KLM at a summit with French President Jacques Chirac starting with dinner in the Italian town of Lucca later on Thursday. Air France KLM meanwhile reported second-quarter operating profit up 7.8 percent to 568 million euros ($731 million) and hiked synergy targets from its 2004 Franco-Dutch airline merger. Yet even before the Alitalia comments, Air France KLM shares fell around 2 percent on disappointment over cargo losses as well as profit-taking triggered by the airline's failure to dazzle when compared with market forecasts, analysts said. Air France KLM's operating earnings lagged a Reuters survey of analysts who on average predicted 584 million euros. A 19 percent increase in passenger operating profit to 505 million euros met headwinds from a 6 million euro loss in cargo operations, triggered by price pressure in Asia. The group posted a sharp drop in net profit for the three months to end-September to 374 million euros, but this was expected because of a large capital gain a year earlier on the sale of a reservations system stake. The net figure exceeded the Reuters poll average of 360 million euros and compared with 717 million a year earlier. "The first quarter was excellent, the second was very good," said Pierre-Henri Gourgeon, deputy chief executive. "Reservations for coming weeks are completely in line with the strong activity of the first half. This enables us to confirm our target for a significant increase in (2006-07) operating profit compared to 2005-06," Gourgeon said. Air France KLM raised its synergy targets resulting from the 2004 merger of the French and Dutch national carriers from 465 to 500 million euros for 2006/07, from 570 to 605 million euros for 2007/08 and from 670 to 710 million euros for 2008/2009. Group revenues rose 8.8 percent to 6.13 billion euros. The airline's yield, the underlying amount it makes from each passenger, rose 4.7 percent as it adopted a firmer price policy to ease its high load factor, executives said.
