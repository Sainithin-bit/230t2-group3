 WARSAW  (Reuters) - The U.S. economy is slowing but the 
outlook is benign, while Japan is poised for its longest 
post-war growth spell, OECD chief Angel Gurria said on 
Thursday. 

  "The U.S. is slowing down but the overall diagnosis is 
benign," Gurria told reporters on the sidelines of an economic 
conference. "Japan is going into the longest, not the 
strongest, growth period after World War Two."  Asked whether current oil prices posed a threat to global 
economic growth, Gurria said: "No."  The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and 
Development is due to publish its twice-yearly world economic 
outlook on November 28.  Financial markets widely expect the U.S. economy to cool 
off, but most investors now bet on a soft-landing rather than 
an abrupt downturn that would badly hurt global growth and hurt 
financial markets worldwide.  Commenting on Poland, the OECD chief said he believed 
inflation remained well under control and that the country 
should only join the euro area once its economy was prepared to 
swap the zloty for the single currency.  While Polish inflation remains one of the lowest in the 
European Union, some central bankers have warned it masked a 
build-up of price pressures that could push prices sharply 
higher next year and beyond.
