 BERLIN  (Reuters) - German corporate sentiment unexpectedly 
rose in November to equal a 15-year high as business 
expectations and firms' assessment of current conditions 
improved, a key survey showed on Thursday. 

  The Munich-based Ifo research institute said its business 
climate index, based on a monthly poll of around 7,000 firms, 
rose to 106.8 from 105.3 in October.  The survey posted its second consecutive rise to equal its 
June reading, which was the highest since February 1991.  Euro zone government bond futures fell and the euro hit its 
highest level since early June on the back of the index, 
bolstering the view that interest rates are headed higher.  The Ifo headline figure was above the mid-range forecast of 
66 economists polled by Reuters last week for a fall to 105.2. 
Forecasts ranged between 104.0 and 106.0.  "These survey results indicate a further continuation of 
the economic upswing," Ifo said in a statement.  A breakdown of the survey showed the assessment of current 
conditions had risen to 113.9 from 111.9 in October. The 
expectations component improved to 100.1 from 99.2.  Analysts were stunned by the improvement in sentiment, 
which came just weeks before a three percentage point increase 
in value added tax (VAT) on January 1 is set to dampen German 
growth at the start of next year.  "I don't know what to say. The positive sentiment among 
German companies is indescribable," said DekaBank economist 
Andreas Scheuerle in Frankfurt.  "It's particularly surprising that the expectations did not 
fall. It appears that companies are looking past the expected 
dip in growth with a view that the economic pickup will regain 
steam thereafter," he said.
