 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - German truckmaker MAN ( MANG.DE ) said 
on Thursday it would not reduce production staff should it 
successfully acquire Swedish rival Scania ( SCVb.ST ) in its 10.3 
billion euro ($13.4 billion) hostile bid. 

  "Under my leadership no business unit will subsidise 
another. That means that there will be no discrimination of 
Swedish employees in favor of Germans or vice versa," MAN Chief 
Executive Hakan Samuelsson added in a statement.  The comments come as MAN tries to defuse objections from 
Scania workers who have said synergies would be exploited at 
their expense because MAN's German workforce enjoys job 
guarantees through 2011.  A combined MAN-Scania entity would become the European 
truck market leader, and would be better able to compete with 
global giants like DaimlerChrysler DCXGn.DE and Volvo 
( VOLVb.ST ) due to greater scale advantages in purchasing, spare 
parts distribution, customer finance and service networks.  MAN believes the combined businesses could grow faster and 
better target growth markets than either could achieve alone.  "Accordingly, it is the intention to have more people 
working in Sweden and in Germany in five years' time," MAN 
said.  The German truckmaker needs all the support it can get, 
since Scania's management under CEO Leif Ostling has fiercely 
rebuffed MAN's approaches.  Ultimately, the deal will come down to the support, or lack 
thereof, from Scania's two largest shareholders, Volkswagen 
( VOWG.DE ) and the Wallenberg family, together with its Investor 
AB ( INVEb.ST ) vehicle.  VW supports the tie-up in principle, but has left all 
options open in case MAN and Scania cannot agree on terms.
