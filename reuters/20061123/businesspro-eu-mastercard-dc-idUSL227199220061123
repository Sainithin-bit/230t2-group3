 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Credit card company MasterCard drew a 
rebuke at a closed European Commission antitrust hearing last 
week after claiming incorrectly that Britain had dropped an 
investigation into its fees, people who were present said. 

  MasterCard ( MA.N ) made the statement near the start of the 
two-day hearing on Commission allegations that it sets 
excessive charges on shops and others that accept its credit 
and debit cards, they said.  Merchants pay banks an "interchange fee" -- a percentage of 
each purchase -- to process card-based transactions.  EU countries, shops and representatives of the airline and 
petroleum industries sharply criticised MasterCard's fees.  The Commission conducted the hearing to let MasterCard 
reply to allegations that it restricts competition by setting 
minimum prices retailers must pay. The EU executive is 
considering abolishing the controversial and complex interbank 
fees charged by MasterCard, which can differ card by card.  Merchants hate the fees.  A representative of Ikea, the Swedish furniture chain, said 
it could lower costs on many items, even amid high energy 
prices, but could not negotiate the fees imposed by MasterCard.  Others that use the cards, from British Petroleum ( BP.L ) to 
the International Air Transport Association (IATA), a trade 
group of airlines, also complained.  Some said a MasterCard rule that they must accept all of 
the company's cards made it impossible to control costs. 
MasterCard imposes different fees on different cards, and 
merchants say it can be difficult to learn of the fees for a 
particular card.  Several countries -- in particular Britain, Belgium and 
Finland -- say MasterCard raised rates on debit cards when it 
took over their operation.  MasterCard said its fees were reasonable, citing as 
evidence what it called a decision by Britain to drop an 
investigation of them. But a British official said the probe 
was ongoing.  The two sides focused on Australia, whose central bank 
forced MasterCard and Visa to lower their interchange fees in 
2003 after the rival card firms lost a court battle.  The central bank this year also set new standards on debit 
cards, aimed at reducing interchange fees. Two weeks ago, New 
Zealand's competition authority started legal proceedings 
against 11 financial institutions including Visa and 
MasterCard.  MasterCard said it had been badly hurt by its Australian 
experience and the change of structure had cut its income. 
Those on the other side said the Australian sanctions had 
worked.  MasterCard called the Commission's complaint obsolete 
because it was made when the company was a non-profit 
organisation. MasterCard recently went public.  But the Commission said the violations dated to before the 
change occurred and that the earlier actions could be producing 
long-term effects.  MasterCard, when contacted by Reuters, had no immediate 
comment.
