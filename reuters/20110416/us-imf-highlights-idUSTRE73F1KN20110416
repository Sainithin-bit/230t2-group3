 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Following are highlights of comments by financial leaders attending the International Monetary Fund and World Bank spring meetings on Saturday. 

 FRENCH ECONOMY MINISTER CHRISTINE LAGARDE: COMMODITY PRICES: "We must collectively seek solutions for ... enhancing market integrity through better regulation and supervision of commodity derivatives, with a view to limit market abuse and price manipulation, notably by setting position limits." NEW FINANCIAL REGULATIONS: "Without concrete and effective implementation of this core agenda of the G20, commitments will remain vain lip-service, thus undermining the G20's legitimacy and could encourage cherry-picking by members over the agenda." CAPITAL CONTROLS "It seems vital to have a common set of rules on the management of capital flows and related policies, including the implementation of capital controls if necessary. SURVEILLANCE ROLE OF THE IMF: "I would hope that the triennial review (this year) ... will identify ways to strengthen and modernize for the long term our surveillance framework that is increasingly less adapted to new economic and financial realities. PROMOTING USE OF THE SDR: "A first step is to ensure the composition of the basket is a reflection of the global economy ... Promoting SDRs could also involve the development of a private SDR market, with the IMF issuing SDR denominated bonds or through regulator allocations, possibly with strict terms of use to mitigate the risk of moral hazard." IMF GOLD SALES "The IMF should use profits from its gold sales to continue lending to poor countries." WOLFGANG SCHAEUBLE, GERMANY'S FINANCE MINISTER: ON FINANCIAL STABILITY: "Global financial stability hast improved but has not been completely restored." "Germany agrees that the complex feedback between sovereign and banking risks and the real economy currently is the most relevant challenge for financial stability." ON CAPITAL CONTROLS: "We recognize that situations may arise where capital flow measures are appropriate to complement - as a last line of defense - sound macroeconomic and macro-prudential policies in order to protect an economy from shocks." MOHAMED LAKSACI, ALGERIAN CENTRAL BANK GOVERNOR ON UNREST IN ARAB WORLD: "While the recent events in the Middle East and North Africa are likely to have a negative impact on short-term growth prospects in the region, strong fundamentals in many countries should allow for a rapid resumption of growth as orderly conditions are restored, with a key challenge being to ensure sustained job creation to absorb the high unemployment, especially among the youth. "Adequate support from the international community to affected countries would help expedite the restoration of normal economic and social conditions and ease the financial burden of the growth-and-employment-accelerating programs." SULTAN NASSER AL-SUWEIDI, GOVERNOR OF CENTRAL BANK OF UNITED ARAB EMIRATES, ON THE MIDDLE EAST: "Besides rising commodity prices and associated inflationary concerns, new fiscal pressures have emerged as many economies increase subsidies and transfers. Chronically high unemployment, especially among the youth, is a daunting challenge that cannot be realistically addressed in the near term." IBRAHIM ALASSAF, FINANCE MINISTER OF SAUDI ARABIA ON OIL SUPPLIES: "Recent crude oil prices are not supported by basic supply-demand balances, and have more to do with financial speculation than industry fundamentals. At present the market remains well-supplied and there is still substantial additional production capacity available should it be needed. "Time after time (Saudi Arabia) has delivered .. by tapping its additional crude oil production capacity when supply conditions warranted, and Saudi Arabia will continue to reliably meet the world's petroleum needs. ON CAPITAL CONTROLS: "It is important that the Fund should not take steps that would appear to restrict policy choices available to member countries facing surges in volatile capital flows. What is important is that the Fund should continue, at the request of member countries, to provide technical assistance on capital account policies." YOSHIHIKO NODA, FINANCE MINISTER, JAPAN: ON MECHANISM FOR SHORT-TERM FUND SUPPLY: "When responding to a systemic crisis, similar to that of 2008, it is necessary to promptly provide sufficient funds in order to prevent a crisis contagion. From this perspective, it is important to establish a mechanism, similiar to the Short-term Liquidity Line (SLL) proposed by the Fund last summer ... by the next meeting of the IMFC, a conclusion should be reached on this matter." ON JAPAN FISCAL REFORM: "We will carry out plans to create a marvelous Tohoku region and a marvelous Japan. While these efforts will not require a permanent increase in government expenditures, the necessary amount of funds will not be small. Notwithstanding, achieving fiscal consolidation in the medium term will continue to be one of Japan's most critical tasks." DUVVURI SUBBARAO, GOVERNOR, RESERVE BANK OF INDIA: ON OIL PRICES: "The global recovery may be jeopardized by a sustained rise in oil prices." "Speculative movements in commodity derivative markets are also causing volatility in prices." SPECIAL DRAWING RIGHTS: "The SDR has to be accepted as a liability at the IMF, has to be automatically acceptable as a medium of payment in cross-border transactions, be freely tradable and its price has to be determined by forces of demand and supply. As the SDR does not satisfy these conditions, it cannot be a reserve currency in the international payment system." "Going by the recent initiatives, if at all there is a move to alter the composition of the SDR basket, we could consider including currencies of those dynamically emerging market economies that satisfy the existing inclusion criteria: in particular, a fully convertible capital account and a market determined exchange rate."
