 (Reuters) - Shares in American jewelry company Tiffany ( TIF.N ) could rise following a recent pullback, Barron's wrote in its July 9 edition. 
 The target price for the luxury goods maker's shares is $63, according to analysts at Canaccord Genuity, the financial weekly said. Tiffany stock closed at $53.45 on Friday, down from close to $70 in early May. Canaccord Genuity said the stock's recent pullback has opened a window of opportunity in a company with significant global expansion opportunities, according to Barron's.
