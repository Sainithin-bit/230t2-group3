 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - New U.S. claims for unemployment benefits fell last week, but held above the key 400,000 level, according to government report on Thursday. 

 KEY POINTS: * Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 13,000 to a seasonally adjusted 403,000, the Labor Department said, unwinding some of the prior week's quarter-end jump. * Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims slipping to 392,000. The prior week's figure was revised up to 416,000 from the previously reported 412,000. * The four-week moving average of unemployment claims, a better measure of underlying trends, rose 2,250 to 399,000. COMMENTS: PETER BOOCKVAR, EQUITY STRATEGIST, MILLER TABAK + CO, NEW YORK "For the second week in a row, initial jobless claims were above expectations. The Labor Department did say that end-of-quarter administrative changes were the reason for last week's jump but this week there are no special factors cited. The lack of robustness in the labor market is the main crutch that the Fed is leaning on in justifying to themselves their current policy and why QE2 will run to its conclusion on June 30th." ROBBERT VAN BATENBURG, HEAD OF GLOBAL RESEARCH, LOUIS CAPITAL MARKETS, NEW YORK "I think this is a recurring story that job growth is very anemic. The trend is still down but it's going at a snail's pace. The homebuilding sector is still very weak. Governments are struggling to hire people or are laying off people. It's a very sluggish labor market no matter how you slice it. This does help Treasuries, and the TIPS auction (later Thursday) should go off extremely well." SUBODH KUMAR, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, SUBODH KUMAR & ASSOCIATES, TORONTO "Looks like (jobless claims) have flattened out in the last weeks, consistent with an economy that is still growing, but moderating. "With this kind of data I expect continuation of weakness in the U.S. dollar. Some are looking forward to the Fed meeting next week, for the Fed to allow QE2 to expire but not sell off its portfolio quickly. These kinds of numbers would support that view. "I expect equities to see some consolidation today after yesterday's rally." SEAN INCREMONA, ECONOMIST, 4CAST LTD, NEW YORK "It is definitely a disappointing pullback. It gives the impression that the momentum of labor market improvement is a bit disappointing at this point. "We are still looking at a moderate recovery, so near-term we might have to edge lower some employment calls, I think we are still going to see the recovery sustained. "Stocks have pulled back -- they have been optimistic over the last few days with positive earnings and such -- and this might temper the macro view a bit. On the same hand this will be positive for bonds." ROBERT BRUSCA, CHIEF ECONOMIST, FACT AND OPINION ECONOMICS, NEW YORK "This suggests something is going on. Maybe last week's spike wasn't a fluke. The economy has been showing that things haven't been as robust. The rise in oil prices has shocked consumer confidence. The question mark is how higher energy prices will affect growth. "Manufacturing data are still robust, but the services sector is not producing a lot of growth with consumer spending on services still weak." VIMOMBI NSHOM, ECONOMIST, IFR ECONOMICS, A UNIT OF THOMSON REUTERS "Although initial claims did not fall last week as much as economists had expected (average forecast, 392k) from the quarter-ending effect that had spiked filings to 416k, claims did improve, as 403,000 unemployed filed for benefits in the week ending April 16. The seasonally adjusted decline of 13k corrects less than half of the 31k increase from the week prior, but on an unadjusted basis, filings actually fell more than expected (seasonals expected a 12 percent decline and received one of 15 percent). Claims are now 14 percent lower than the level this time last year. The average inched up, for the second week, to 399,000, a gain of 2.25k. "Continued filings nudged down 7k in the week ending April 9, to 3.695 mln. Its average fell a steeper 17.5k to 3.717 mln no longer referencing weeks whose levels rounded to 3.8 mln. The percentage of the eligible population receiving unemployment insurance held at 2.9 percent." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stock index futures slightly pare gains. BONDS: U.S. bond prices extend earlier gains. FOREX: The dollar falls to session low versus the yen.
