 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The summer launch of Toyota Motor Co's ( 7203.T ) small car, the Scion iQ, could be delayed this year as the world's largest automaker grapples with disruptions among parts suppliers in Japan. 

 Jack Hollis, the vice president of Scion, said he expected to know more about the iQ's launch schedule after the "Golden Week" holidays in Japan that last from April 28 to May 9. Toyota had previously suspended output for all its factories in Japan during that time and plans to re-open on May 10 at half the normal production rate. "Until we get confirmation from Japan on production, what we might end up having to forgo is the early launch of the new iQ," Hollis said in an interview on the sidelines of the New York International Auto Show. The March 11 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear crisis in Japan forced Toyota to close its Japanese assembly plants and curtail production in North America. Automakers have had to scramble as they search for auto parts, particularly electronic components and semiconductors, as their stockpiles dwindle. Toyota's luxury brand Lexus is expected to fall short of its plans for U.S. sales this year, the group vice president told Reuters on Wednesday. Hollis projected Scion will be able to meet its sales target for the year of between 55,000 and 65,000, even with a delay in the iQ's launch, which he called "really important" to the Scion brand. "I don't know that we lose many sales because I don't think anything else is able to deliver on what we're asking for," Hollis said. He added: "You just get those sales later." When it was unveiled last year, the iQ was seen as a competitor of Daimler's ( DAIGn.DE ) Smart car, which Hollis said has not delivered on everything buyers wanted. Scion is Toyota's brand aimed at younger consumers. The median age of the brand's buyers is 35, Hollis said. The minicar will be attractive for younger consumers living in major cities who desire ease of parking and travel. Rising fuel prices will also help drive demand for the iQ.
