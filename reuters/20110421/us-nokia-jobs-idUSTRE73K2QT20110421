 HELSINKI  (Reuters) - The world's largest mobile phone maker Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ) is expected to begin lay-off talks in Finland next week, labor union officials said on Thursday. 

 "Next week they will begin the lay-off talks," said Pertti Porokari from the Union of Professional Engineers in Finland. "Today the staff and the unions have been told that all contracts will continue until the end of the year," he said, adding he feared that Nokia would cut more than 1,000 jobs in Finland.
