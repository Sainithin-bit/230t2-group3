 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Confetti, loud music, and a century-old vase are just some of the things that set the Nasdaq Stock Market apart from the New York Stock Exchange -- so the U.S. Justice Department can just rest easy. 

 That is part of the message Robert Greifeld, the chief executive of Nasdaq OMX Group ( NDAQ.O ), is sending the antitrust enforcer as it reviews his proposed $11 billion merger with rival exchange operator NYSE Euronext NYX.N. "We have a lot of loud music going as we open our bell, we have confetti. Theirs, they're on a balcony over a trading floor," Greifeld said on a Wednesday conference call with analysts and members of the media. The CEO was defending his unsolicited bid for the Big Board against concerns that it will create a monopoly in listings, essentially arguing that the fierce competition between Nasdaq and NYSE to list shares is not really all that important to companies shopping around for a venue. "We host investor events in kind of a cool conference room, and they have a conference room with a lot of wood, a vase if I recollect from Czar Nicholas," Greifeld said with a touch of levity in an otherwise bitter takeover battle. "So we compete room to room and bell to bell, and it is competition but it's not essential. So that's a broad outline of some of the things that we're talking to the DOJ about," he added. "We pursue the arguments, and right now we're encouraged." In rejecting the joint takeover bid from Nasdaq and IntercontinentalExchange Inc ( ICE.N ), NYSE Euronext's board has suggested U.S. regulators would very likely block it, and reiterated its support for a friendly acquisition by Germany's Deutsche Boerse AG ( DB1Gn.DE ). Nasdaq has said the antitrust issues are manageable, and has pursued the bid. But the company generally needs to convince the DOJ that today's level of competition to list U.S. stocks will remain, if its buyout succeeds. Nasdaq will likely argue that listing fees will remain largely stable and highly regulated, that BATS Exchange intends to start listing shares, and that it competes globally with the London Stock Exchange ( LSE.L ), Hong Kong and others.
