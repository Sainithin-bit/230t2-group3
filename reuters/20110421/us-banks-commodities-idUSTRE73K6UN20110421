 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wall Street investment banks took more risk in trading commodities in the first quarter, with Goldman Sachs leading the pack, as strong oil, metals and agricultural prices helped drive profits. 

 The maximum money U.S. banks were prepared to lose a day on commodities, calculated by a measure called value-at-risk (VaR), rose by up to two-thirds from the previous quarter as raw materials markets extended a run-up that began in the middle of last year. Goldman saw the highest growth for the commodities VaR, which rose by just over 60 percent at the bank from the fourth quarter of 2010. That put it back above rival Morgan Stanley, whose commodities risk had led Goldman's in the second and third quarters of last year before narrowing. For the just-ended quarter, Morgan Stanley's commodities VaR was up just 27 percent. JPMorgan Chase, the second largest U.S. bank and another keen contender to Goldman and Morgan Stanley in commodities, kept its risk flat. All three reported healthy trading results from commodities, carried out largely for clients and, to a lesser extent, their own accounts. "Despite concerns that they're becoming increasingly expensive and somewhat of a tired trade, commodities have been providing banks with stronger and stronger returns since the end of the financial crisis," said Matthew McCormick, banking analyst at Bahl & Gaynor in Cincinnati, Ohio. "Goldman Sachs acknowledges this by once again leading risks in this area, though they're also calling for lower commodity prices now," McCormick said. GOLDMAN STUNS Goldman stunned traders and investors in commodities when it suddenly turned bearish last week after being a bull through most of the commodity market's rebound over the last 2-1/2 years. It called on its clients to underweight commodities over a three-to-six month period, saying prices, particularly those for oil, had gotten ahead of fundamentals. London's Brent crude oil fell almost 5 percent over two days after Goldman's call. But the correction was short-lived as a weaker U.S. dollar and supply concerns pushed prices back up. In Thursday's trade, Brent hovered near $124 a barrel, up 30 percent on the year and 175 percent higher since the lows of December 2008. Some analysts said even if commodities saw a sustained sell-off over the next three months, Goldman's risk levels in the area may actually rise rather than fall as the bank could be buying into futures made cheaper by the correction -- in the hope of selling them later for a windfall. "The great thing about trading commodities is what really helps drive them is the volatility," said Michael Nix, Co-Chief Investment Officer at Greenwood Capital Associates in Greenville, South Carolina. "It's not always a directional trade. You can as easily make money when it's going down as you would when it's going up. It's not a binary type of trade," Nix said. While Wall Street banks break down their earnings from equities, they are highly secretive when it comes to commodities, often using simple words like "good" or "weak" to describe performance. Goldman said commodities had a "pretty good" first quarter; Morgan Stanley reported "significant improvement from the previous quarter and JPMorgan noted a "strong performance". Goldman's commodities VaR rose to as high as $51 million in the third quarter of 2008, before the financial crisis forced it to dial down risks. After a rebound in 2009, the bank's commodities VaR fell again for three straight quarters last year, as it wound down proprietary trading to comply with new U.S. financial laws.
