 HELSINKI  (Reuters) - The euro zone is facing its worst crisis and, if the crisis sparked by Greece is not solved, there is a risk of a new recession, Finnish Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen said on Saturday. 

 "If the domino effect begins, no economy is safe," Vanhanen told national Finnish broadcaster YLE in an interview. "No one has a model from history for how the euro zone or the EU should act now. We are doing this with our best knowledge and consideration." But Vanhanen said efforts now under way would ensure the common currency will not collapse. "Actions are being take in such a way that there is no fear of this," he said. Euro zone leaders agreed on Friday that they would have special measures ready before financial markets open on Monday to prevent financial turmoil in Greece spreading to other countries such as Spain and Portugal. The leaders of the 16 countries that use the single currency said after talks with the European Central Bank and the executive European Commission that they were ready to take whatever steps were needed to protect the stability of the euro area. "Surely not it is not in the interest of markets that this situation should drift into chaos," Vanhanen said. (Reporting by  Brett Young  and  Terhi Kinnunen ; Editing by  Kevin Liffey )
