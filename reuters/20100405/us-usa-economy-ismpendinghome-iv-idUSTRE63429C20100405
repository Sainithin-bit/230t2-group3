 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. services sector grew in March at its fastest pace in nearly four years while pending home sales rose, suggesting ongoing improvement in the economy. 

 PENDING HOME SALES: Contracts for pending sales of previously owned homes unexpectedly rose in February, a survey from the National Association of Realtors showed, a rise the group said may be attributed to home buyers taking advantage of a soon-to-expire tax credit. KEY POINTS: * The Institute for Supply Management said its services index jumped to 55.4, its strongest reading since May 2006, from 53.0 in February. That was the index's third consecutive monthly gain and was above the 54.0 median forecast of 70 economists surveyed by Reuters. A reading above 50 indicates expansion. * The report's business activity index hit 60 in March, its highest level since April 2006, compared with 54.8 in February. The employment index edged up to 49.8 from 48.6 while new orders jumped to 62.3 from 55.0. * The Realtors said its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed in February, rose 8.2 percent to 97.6 from a downwardly revised 90.2 in January. * Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast pending home sales, which lead existing home sales by one to two months, would remain essentially unchanged in February. COMMENTS: STEVE GOLDMAN, MARKET STRATEGIST, WEEDEN & CO, GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT: "The data is generally friendly but it's not leading to another push higher given the fact that we've been moving higher for five consecutive weeks." SCOTT BROWN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, RAYMOND JAMES & ASSOCIATES, ST PETERSBURG, FLORIDA: "The ISM services data was stronger than anticipated, which should be a bit negative for Treasury bonds and positive for the stock market. There was pretty good growth on new orders, while the employment component was a bit soft." MARK VITNER, SENIOR ECONOMIST, WELLS FARGO SECURITIES, CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA: "(ISM) is certainly good news, the recovery seems to be gaining a little momentum. Just like the manufacturing index, the thing that is most important to me is the new orders and the order backlog and both improved substantially. The significance of the backlog of orders is, that is what businesses need to see before they boost employment because it gives them the confidence to go ahead and spend a little money if they feel like they have got a significant order backlog to fall back on. "The pending home sales number is a nice surprise because pretty much everybody had given up on housing. It does look like the extension of the first time homebuyers tax credit will produce some benefit at some point." ADAM YORK, ECONOMIST, WELLS FARGO SECURITIES, CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA: "Pending home sales showed a little bit of a bounce-back and overall we had pretty good readings across the country. In fact, decent to very good in some areas. We may be finally seeing help from the extension and expansion of the home buyer tax credits as they need to get signing done by the end of April. The strong pickup came despite bad weather as well, which is a good sign. Contract signings are more impacted by weather than closing. This was a decent report, however, you cannot make a trend out of one report." KURT KARL, CHIEF U.S. ECONOMIST, SWISS RE, NEW YORK: ISM NON-MANUFACTURING: "The momentum has started and it's hard to derail. I think we are in good shape. The employment index is going up and moving toward 50. New orders are very strong. This is a very good report." PENDING HOME SALES: "The housing recovery is weaker in magnitude compared with other recoveries, but it is still recovering. I don't see a lot of double-dip risk, and I don't see much upside risk in inflation with the economy still near 10 percent unemployment." TOM PORCELLI, SENIOR ECONOMIST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, NEW YORK "ISM looks pretty good, underlying details were all generally solid. We were encouraged by improvement in new orders index. We're moving in the right direction with regard to the service side of the equation. "Pending home sales -- both reports are generally supporting the idea that the recovery is moving ahead. We're moving along here -- there's no better way to state it." ALAN GAYLE, SENIOR INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, RIDGEWORTH INVESTMENTS, RICHMOND, VA "Looks like the good news continues. Obviously the pickup in pending homes is very encouraging, though it's difficult to sort out the impact of the home buyer tax credit. While that does introduce some noise, the momentum suggests excess inventories continue to clear, which is good news. "The better-than-expected ISM number is a consistent follow-on of the manufacturing report, which was strong, and the employment report, which suggests we have more people working longer hours. All this suggests that the economic recovery is spilling over into job creation." JOSEPH TREVISANI, CHIEF CURRENCY ANALYST, FXSOLUTIONS, SADDLE RIVER, NEW JERSEY: "Slightly better than expected, as with the manufacturing ISM survey, and will give the dollar a moderate boost." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stock indexes briefly ticked higher. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices were slightly lower. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar rose against the yen
