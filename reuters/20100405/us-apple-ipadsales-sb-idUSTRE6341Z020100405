 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Apple Inc said it had sold more than 300,000 iPad portable computers on its first day available at retail, eclipsing some Wall Street analysts' forecasts for sales during the entire weekend. 

 Sales on Saturday, April 3, included deliveries of preordered iPads to customers, deliveries to channel partners and sales at Apple Retail Stores, the company said. A number of U.S. stores were closed for the Easter holiday on Sunday, but some did remain open, which suggests that total weekend figures will be higher. Several analysts had expected the company to sell 250,000 to 350,000 units on the opening weekend. (Reporting by  Franklin Paul ; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
