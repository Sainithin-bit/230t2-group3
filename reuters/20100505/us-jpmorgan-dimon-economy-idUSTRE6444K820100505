 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ) Chairman Jamie Dimon says he hopes a strong financial regulatory bill will emerge that will also be good for the U.S. economy. 

 "We've support many of the administration's proposals," Dimon told reporters. "At this point the devils are in the details and we just hope that all those involved take the time to go through the consequences." "We're hopeful that somehow we'll end up with a strong regulatory bill that will also be very good for the future of the economy," he said. Dimon and Caterpillar Inc ( CAT.N ) CEO Jim Owens spoke to reporters about the results of a survey of industry chiefs on how they feel about the future of their companies. Dimon said CEOs expressed concern about the long-term U.S. fiscal deficit and they see positive signs of broad-based, economic growth in the United States, Europe and Asia. Dimon added that consumer delinquencies are improving, consumer spending is up, companies have plenty of liquidity and companies are hiring more aggressively this year. "We need a strong, vibrant, globally competitive financial services sector because it supports our success as businesses," Owens said. (Reporting by  John Poirier ; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)
