 HELSINKI  (Reuters) - Nokia and Microsoft unveiled on Wednesday the first result of their new software collaboration aimed at breaking the dominance of Research in Motion's BlackBerry in wireless services for corporations. 

 Nokia and Microsoft, at one time fierce rivals in the mobile telecommunications business, announced the alliance in August 2009. They expect to offer Nokia phones running Microsoft's Office programs later this year. On Wednesday the companies unveiled Communicator Mobile software, which enables people to see their colleagues' availability, and click to communicate with them using instant messenger, e-mail, text or phone call. The names and status of colleagues are embedded directly in the devices' contacts application. Owners of Nokia E52 and E72 models can download it as of today from Nokia's Ovi Store.
