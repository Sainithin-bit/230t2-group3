 (Reuters) - Euro zone finance ministers decided on Sunday that debt-stricken Greece cannot finance itself on the markets and should receive emergency loans in exchange for a multi-year austerity plan. 

 Below are the key points of the agreement between euro zone finance ministers on the loans. HOW MUCH MONEY CAN GREECE COUNT ON? A total of 110 billion euros ($146.5 billion). European Commission officials expect Greece will be able to return to markets in the second half of 2011 and that not all of the funds in the programme will be needed. LENGTH OF STAND-BY LOAN PROGRAMME Three years WHO WOULD LEND TO GREECE? All countries using the euro single currency and the International Monetary Fund. Euro zone member states would contribute to the loans according to their respective holdings in the European Central Bank's capital. For a detailed breakdown see:  here BURDEN SHARING AMONG LENDERS The euro zone would lend 80 billion euros in bilateral loans and 30 billion would come from the International Monetary Fund. FIRST PAYOUT Greece will get the first funds in mid-May to be able to pay back 8.5 billion euros of maturing debt on May 19. In 2010 Greece will receive 30 billion euros from the euro zone. WHEN WILL GREECE REPAY THE LOANS? The loans are for three years so Athens will start repaying them around mid-2013 and end in mid-2016, assuming the loans would continue to be paid out to Greece until the very end of the programme, which European Commission officials do not believe will be necessary. INTEREST For the euro zone, variable rate loans would be made on the basis of three-month EURIBOR rates, while fixed-rate loans will be based upon the rates corresponding to EURIBOR swap rates for the relevant maturities. On top of that, there will be a charge of 300 basis points. An additional 100 basis points will be charged for loans longer than three years. In conformity with IMF charges, a one-time service fee of a maximum 50 basis points will be charged to cover operational costs. The euro zone loans would carry an interest rate of around 5 percent, Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn said. Interest on IMF loans is smaller, Rehn has said. EURO ZONE PROFITS/LOSSES ON LOANS Euro zone countries will borrow on the market at their own rates. They will then send the money to the European Commission which will convert it into fixed interest loans and lend it to Athens. Commission officials said all euro zone countries should make a profit on the loans. If a euro zone country has to borrow on the market at rates that are higher than the loans to Greece, it will be compensated by other euro zone countries that still make profits, so that it does not make a net loss. HOW GREECE WILL GET THE MONEY A summit of euro zone leaders on May 7 will rubber-stamp the decision of euro zone finance ministers from May 2 to extend the loans. Eurogroup Chairman Jean-Claude Juncker said there was no possibility of the leaders changing the decision. The leaders are to exchange information on progress in the parliamentary approval process for the loans in their respective countries. The ECB pays out the money while the Commission acts as a coordinator of the bilateral loans. The IMF board is to approve its 30 billion euro portion of loans to Greece this week, IMF head Dominique Strauss-Kahn said. CONDITIONALITY The loans to Greece are linked to progress in the reform and austerity measures promised by Athens, which will be reviewed on a quarterly basis. The amount of loans to be paid out will be determined after each of such quarterly reviews. There will be 12 quarterly installments of the loans.
