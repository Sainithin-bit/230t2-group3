 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Trading for about a third of floor brokers on the New York Stock Exchange was hampered on Wednesday due to problems receiving reports on executed trades via handheld devices, according to a NYSE spokesperson. 

 "They are experiencing difficulty in receiving reports on orders that have been executed," said Ray Pellecchia. "It is for those individuals making business more difficult." Pellecchia said the cause of the problem was unknown and under investigation. (Reporting by  Edward Krudy ; Editing by  Chizu Nomiyama )
