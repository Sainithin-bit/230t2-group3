 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. private employers added 32,000 jobs in April, while revisions to previous data showed unexpected rises in February and March, according to a report by payrolls processor ADP Employer Services on Wednesday. 

 The March figure was revised to show a gain of 19,000 from an originally reported fall of 23,000. It also showed a rise of 3,000 for February after earlier reported losses, making February the first increase since January 2008. For April, economists had expected the privately released ADP report to show a rise of 30,000 jobs, based on a Reuters poll of analysts. (Reporting by  Burton Frierson ; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
