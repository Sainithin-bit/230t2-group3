 (Reuters) - Toys R Us Inc TOY.UL, which is looking to go public next year, reported a quarterly loss equal to a year earlier, as interest expense declined even as sales at established stores fell. 
 The world's largest dedicated toy retailer said its net loss was $93 million in the third quarter ended October 29, equal to the loss a year earlier. Sales dipped to $2.70 billion from $2.72 billion. Interest expense fell to $106 million from $158 million a year earlier. The New Jersey-based retailer, which operates stores under its namesake brand and the Babies R Us and FAO Schwarz labels, said same-store sales fell 2.2 percent in its domestic unit, while those at its international segment fell 3.9 percent. Toys R Us was taken private in 2005 by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Bain Capital and Vornado Realty Trust in a $6.6 billion deal. The chain filed its IPO paperwork in May 2010 but is not expected to go public until 2012, two sources told Reuters in early July.
