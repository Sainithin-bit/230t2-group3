 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - President Barack Obama will meet with Republican House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner and Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid to discuss ongoing negotiations on the budget at 8:45 p.m. EDT, the White House said. 

 White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters traveling with Obama in New York that the president called the meeting because too little progress had been made in reaching a budget agreement. (Reporting by  Patricia Zengerle  and  Jeff Mason , editing by Eric Beech)
