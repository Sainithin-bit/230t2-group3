 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Republican and Democratic leaders in the Congress do not have a meeting scheduled to discuss a budget deal that would keep the government running beyond Friday, a Republican aide said on Wednesday. 

 Though Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid and House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner, a Republican, have not scheduled a meeting at this point, staffers from both parties will continue their discussion, Boehner spokesman Michael Steel said.
