 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President Barack Obama is not providing leadership to pass a budget for the current fiscal year so the Republican-led House of Representatives will work on a bill to fund the government for another week, Speaker John Boehner said on Wednesday. 

 "The government is due to shut down tomorrow so we're going to be prepared to move forward with our troop funding bill," said Boehner, the top House Republican. "It would fund our troops, keep the government open for another week and cut $12 billion in spending. I think this is the responsible thing to do for the United States Congress."
