 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Assistant U.S. Democratic Senator Dick Durbin said on Wednesday that he is more optimistic that lawmakers would be able to craft a budget deal that will keep the government operating beyond Friday. 

 "I feel better about it today than I did yesterday at the same time," Durbin said at a news conference. (Reporting by  Donna Smith ; Editing by  Sandra Maler )
