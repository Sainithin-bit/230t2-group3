 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Daniel Inouye on Wednesday expressed optimism that a deal could come soon on federal spending this year and thus avoid a partial government shutdown starting on Friday night. 

 "We're moving" forward in negotiations between Democrats and Republicans, Inouye told Reuters. Asked if a deal could be sealed on Wednesday, Inouye responded, "No," but added, "maybe" on Thursday. (Reporting by  Richard Cowan , Editing by Sandra Maler)
