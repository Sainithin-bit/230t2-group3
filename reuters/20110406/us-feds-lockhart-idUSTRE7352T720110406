 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Dennis Lockhart said on Wednesday he does not see the need to raise interest rates before the end of the year with the economy facing headwinds. 

 "I wouldn't rule it out entirely, but at this stage, I am personally not leaning in the direction of thinking that that's absolutely warranted," Lockhart told reporters. (Reporting by  Pedro Nicolaci da Costa ; Editing by  Neil Stempleman )
