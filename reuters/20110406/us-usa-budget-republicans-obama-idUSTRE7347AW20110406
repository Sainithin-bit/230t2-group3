 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The White House said it strongly disagreed with a budget blueprint offered by Paul Ryan, chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives's budget committee. 

 The proposal, aimed at building on Republican promises to shrink the size of government, aims for nearly $6 trillion in budget savings over the next decade, in part by cutting healthcare benefits for the poor and elderly. "While we agree with his ultimate goal, we strongly disagree with his approach," the White House said in a statement. (Writing by  Caren Bohan )
