 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President Barack Obama is willing to hold a meeting with lawmakers at any hour of the day if that's what is needed to reach deal on the budget to avert a government shutdown, his spokesman said on Wednesday. 

 White House spokesman Jay Carney, speaking to reporters while traveling with Obama to Philadelphia, said Obama is willing to meet at any time because "we are very close to a situation that could bring about a shutdown of the government."
