 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said on Wednesday that budget talks to fund the government beyond a Friday deadline are continuing although Republicans keep changing the bottom line. 

 "Every time we agree to meet in the middle they move where the middle is," Reid said in remarks on the Senate floor. (Reporting by  Andy Sullivan ; Editing by  Vicki Allen )
