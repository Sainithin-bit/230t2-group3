 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Republicans and Democrats have mostly agreed on what would get cut in a budget deal that would keep the U.S. government running beyond Friday, but remain at odds over the composition of less than $10 billion in cuts, a Democratic aide said on Wednesday. 

 The final size of the package will depend on what is in it, but it will likely end up closer to the $33 billion number the Democrats have agreed upon rather than the Republicans' $40 billion target, the aide said. (Reporting by  Andy Sullivan ; Editing by  Eric Beech )
