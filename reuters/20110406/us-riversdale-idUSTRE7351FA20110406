 MELBOURNE  (Reuters) - Global miner Rio Tinto ( RIO.AX )( RIO.L ) beat its target to secure a 47 percent stake in Riversdale Mining RIV.AX with its A$3.9 billion ($4 billion) takeover offer, and will pay its sweetened offer. 

 The offer of A$16.50 a share depended on it getting to at least a 47 percent holding in Riversdale by late on April 6. Otherwise it was set to pay A$16 a share. Riversdale's two other key shareholders, India's Tata Steel ( TISC.BO ) and Brazil's CSN ( CSNA3.SA ), have held on to their combined 47 percent stake.
