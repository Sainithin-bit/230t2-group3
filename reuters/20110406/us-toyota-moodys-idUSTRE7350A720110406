 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Moody's Investors Service put its credit rating on Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ) on review for a possible downgrade on Wednesday, citing disruptions to the automaker's supply chain from the March 11 earthquake and tsunami and subsequent power cuts. 

 Moody's also cited Toyota's relatively high dependence on the Japanese market, which could be hit by weak consumer sentiment, for placing the Aa2 long-term senior unsecured and issuer ratings under review. While Toyota's factories have not suffered major damage, the disaster has disrupted shipments of key components and "normal production cannot be expected for many months," Moody's said in a statement. "Furthermore, although few of Toyota's production sites are located in the Kanto area, the company's suppliers may still suffer, given the potential power shortages during the coming high-demand summer season," Moody's added. Moody's said that a rating cut of multiple notches was unlikely, given the company's strong balance sheet. (Reporting by  Nathan Layne ; Editing by Edmund Klamann)
