 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group said it would issue preferred securities in a fund-raising one newspaper put at $4.1 billion, becoming the latest Japanese bank to bolster its capital amid the financial crisis. 

 SMFG, Japan's third-largest bank, said it would announce the capital raising at 0700 GMT. Once thought to be relatively unharmed by the global credit crisis, Japanese banks are now scrambling to raise cash as an economy in recession and over-exposure to plunging domestic stocks sap their capital. The Yomiuri newspaper reported earlier that SMFG would raise 400 billion yen ($4.1 billion) to finance the redemption of outstanding preferred securities and also beef up a capital base being sliced into by a rise in bad loans. "It's pretty clear they are looking less well-capitalized in the current environment. Just to offset the impact of a declining stock market, some serious capital raising is required," said Jason Rogers, credit analyst at Barclays Capital. Shares in SMFG closed down 7.9 percent at 314,000 yen amid a slide in the banking sector. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Japan's top bank, dropped 6.4 percent while No. 2 Mizuho Financial Group fell 7.5 percent. Mitsubishi UFJ and Mizuho have already announced plans to raise up to about $13 billion between them to replenish their capital. In addition to an increase in credit costs, Japan's banks have also been hurt by tumbles in Japanese stocks because they hold big stakes in their clients as a way of cementing ties. Last week SMFG posted a 51 percent fall in quarterly profit, hit by a rise in bad loans as Japan's economy slipped into recession.
