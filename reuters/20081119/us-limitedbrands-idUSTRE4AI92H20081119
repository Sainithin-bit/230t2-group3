 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Limited Brands ( LTD.N ), the retailer whose main chains are Victoria's Secret and Bath and Body Works, posted lower net profit on Wednesday and trimmed its full-year earnings outlook. 

 But the company beat Wall Street expectations by a penny in the third quarter, and shares rose 3.5 percent in after-hours trade, recouping some of its 9 percent drop during the day. Other retailers that posted better-than-expected earnings were Dress Barn Inc DBRN.O and Men's Wearhouse ( MW.N ), but both cut their 2008 earnings outlooks amid an ongoing slump in consumer spending that has cut into apparel companies' profit and sales. Teen retailer Hot Topic HOTT.O, meanwhile, stood by its fourth-quarter outlook as it posted higher net income and sales during the quarter. At Limited, net profit in the third quarter fell 66 percent to $4.17 million, or 1 cent per share, compared with the year-earlier $12.13 million, or 3 cents per share, which included gains from asset sales. Excluding gains, it posted a year-earlier loss of 1 cent per share. Analysts, on average, had been expecting break-even earnings for the latest quarter, according to Reuters Estimates. Operating income in the quarter rose nearly 13 percent to $41.2 million from $36.6 million a year earlier. The company said in August it was expecting earnings to be break-even to 4 cents per share. Limited has seen a long string of falling same-store sales, which measure sales at stores open at least a year and are a key gauge of retail performance. Consumers have cut back on purchases of lingerie and beauty products, saving their money for essentials like food and gasoline. To boost profits, Limited has been cutting back on capital spending, while trimming staff, overhead, inventory and store openings. Sales fell 4 percent in the quarter to $1.84 billion from $1.92 billion a year earlier. Same-store sales, a key gauge of retail performance, fell 7 percent in the quarter. Looking ahead, the Columbus-Ohio company said it expects fourth-quarter earnings between 85 cents and $1.00, compared to Wall Street's average estimate of 99 cents per share. Limited said full-year earnings are now expected to range between $1.20 to $1.35, excluding first-half significant items of 20 cents per share. That range was five cents below the adjusted earnings range of $1.45 and $1.60 the company gave in August. Shares, which are down 60 percent since January, rose to $7.85 after closing at $7.58 -- down 9 percent on the New York Stock Exchange in the regular session. Shares of Men's Wearhouse rose 3 percent to $10.10 after hours after tumbling 10 percent in regular trade, while Dress Barn rose nearly 2 percent to $6.62 after falling 5 percent during the day. Hot Topic shares, which were down 4 percent in regular trade, rose 2 percent to $7.25 in extended trade. (Reporting by  Alexandria Sage ; Editing by  Bernard Orr )
