 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp plans additional temporary plant shutdowns into 2009 due to slowing demand and will pare overtime to cut costs, a company spokesman said on Tuesday. 

 GM notified workers at five plants that produce a broad array of vehicles from mid and full size pickup trucks to SUVs and crossovers of the planned temporary downtime on Tuesday, GM spokesman Chris Lee said. The automaker, which has lobbied Congress for government bridge loans to survive the downturn, did not quantify the number of workers who would be laid off temporarily or the amount of money it expected to save by curbing overtime. The overtime cuts covered five plants also, he said. (Reporting by  David Bailey ; Editing by  Bernard Orr )
