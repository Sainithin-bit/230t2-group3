 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A forward-looking index of U.S. nonresidential construction activity fell to the lowest level in its 13-year history last month as spending slumped on healthcare and educational facilities, an architects' trade group said on Wednesday. 

 The Architecture Billings Index fell more than 5 points to 36.2 in October, the American Institute of Architects said. A reading below 50 indicates a decline in billings. A separate measure of inquiries for new projects fell to 39.9, from 51 in September, also reaching a record low. "Governments and nonprofit agencies are having difficulties getting bonds approved to finance large-scale education and healthcare facilities," AIA chief economist Kermit Baker said. "Until recently, the institutional sector had been somewhat insulated." The AIA's survey began in 1995. It is considered a leading indicator of construction activity about nine to 12 months in the future. Companies that sell to the nonresidential construction market include diversified manufacturer Honeywell International Inc ( HON.N ); lighting maker Acuity Brands Inc ( AYI.N ); electrical components maker Thomas & Betts Corp TNB.N; diversified industrial company Ingersoll Rand Co Ltd ( IR.N ); and Johnson Controls Inc ( JCI.N ), which makes heating, ventilation and cooling systems. Caterpillar Inc ( CAT.N ), Terex Corp ( TEX.N ), Cooper Industries Ltd CBE.N, and Illinois Tool Works Inc ( ITW.N ), among others, also have exposure to the sector.
