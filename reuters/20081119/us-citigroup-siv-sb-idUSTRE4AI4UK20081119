 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc ( C.N ) said it agreed to buy $17.4 billion of assets remaining in a series of funds known as structured investment vehicles, after previously having guaranteed the funds' liabilities. 

 The transaction will be nearly cashless because the funds were essentially on Citigroup's balance sheet already. The assets will be accounted for on an "available for sale" basis, meaning changes in their value will affect the company's balance sheet equity but not its earnings. Citigroup agreed in December to support the SIVs, which at the time had about $49 billion of assets. At one point the bank's SIVs were off balance sheet entities holding some $100 billion of assets. SIVs borrow in short-term and medium-term debt markets in order to fund longer-term assets. As commercial paper markets dried up last year, investors grew concerned that SIVs would have to liquidate nearly $400 billion of assets, further pressuring bond markets. Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ) and Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) last year had planned to set up a bailout fund to rescue the SIV market, but those plans were abandoned due to lack of demand in late December.
