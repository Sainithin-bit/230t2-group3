 LONDON  (Reuters) - Oil company BP said it had so far spent $2.35 billion on the response effort to its Gulf of Mexico oil spill. 

 The London-based company said the sum included $126 million paid out in claims to those affected by the disaster. Progress on the relief well, intended to kill the leaking well, and measures to improve the capture of oil from the leaking well, were on track, BP said.
