 (Reuters) - BP Plc said it will have up to 80,000 barrels (3.4 million gallons/12.7 million litres) a day of oil-processing capacity for crude collected from the leak in the Gulf of Mexico by mid-July. 

 Here are details of BP's efforts, as explained by the company and the U.S. Coast Guard: CURRENT SYSTEM: * A containment cap was on the remnant of a pipe jutting from the top of a lower marine riser package, or LMRP, which sits atop a failed blowout preventer at the wellhead. * Oil and gas continued to gush from under the cap and through three open vents at the top as BP pumps nitrogen and methanol into the cap. * Captured oil and gas travelled through a pipe, called a riser, connected from the top of the cap to Transocean Ltd's Discoverer Enterprise drillship at the ocean's surface, one mile (1.6 km) above. * BP ramped up collection from 6,000 barrels a day on June 4, the first full day of operation, to more than 16,000 barrels a day on June 23. * BP shut down the system for nearly five hours on June 15 when a fire was discovered at the top of a derrick on the Enterprise. BP said a lightning strike caused the fire, which was quickly extinguished and hurt no one. A faulty sensor caused another 30-minute shutdown. The interruptions reduced the day's oil collection to 10,440 barrels. * BP shut down the system and removed the cap on June 23 when an underwater robot apparently hit one of the vents and closed it. BP noticed the problem at 8:45 a.m. CDT (1345 GMT) when liquids discharged from a valve connected to a line that channels warm water to the leak site for temperature control. * BP intended to reinstall the cap. * The Enterprise can process up to 18,000 barrels a day. It can store up to 147,000 barrels, but oil must be separated from natural gas and water through processing first. Natural gas is being flared off. * A shuttle tanker began taking oil from the drillship to transport ashore on June 9. The tanker can hold up to 140,000 barrels and transport it to shore, unload it and return to the drillship in four days. ADDITIONAL OIL COLLECTION CAPACITY * At 1 a.m. CDT (0600 GMT) on June 16, BP started up a second containment system at the seafloor. * The system is using seabed equipment installed last month to conduct the failed "top kill" operation to boost the containment cap system. * That involved pumping heavy drilling fluid into the blowout preventer to try to smother the leak. Mud was pumped from a ship to a service rig and down to a manifold, which routed the fluid to two hoses connected to the blowout preventer. * BP is reversing direction to pull oil from the blowout preventer through one of the hoses and manifold to a service rig, Helix Energy Solutions' Q4000, at the surface. * The system surpassed its 10,000 barrels-per-day capacity, burning nearly 10,500 barrels on June 22. * The oil must be burnt off because the rig has no storage capacity to keep it on board. Natural gas is being flared as well. MORE CAPACITY COMING * The Enterprise and Q4000 will operate as originally planned. * By the week of June 28, BP intends to add up to another 25,000 barrels a day of capacity to the 28,000 provided by the Enterprise and the Q4000. The company originally had planned to reach up to 50,000 barrels (2.1 million gallons/7.9 million litres) day of capacity by mid-July. * BP will connect the blowout preventer hose not used by the Q4000 to the Helix Producer, a rig with capacity to process up to 25,000 barrels a day. * Collected oil would travel through the blowout preventer to a floating pipe, called a riser. * The riser will stretch to about 300 feet (91.5 metres) below the water's surface. * A hose will connect the riser to the vessel. * The floating-pipe setup allows the vessel to quickly disconnect from the pipe and move out of the way if a hurricane approaches. * Until mid-July, the Enterprise and Q4000 would remain hooked to less hurricane-ready systems that cannot be disconnected quickly. MORE HURRICANE PREPAREDNESS * By the end of June, BP plans to switch the current containment cap with a new one that is larger and has a stronger seal. If it works as planned, the cap will cover the entire top of the LMRP, not just the pipe remnant, and oil should not leak. * Oil will leak unchecked during the cap switch because nothing will cover the opening. * The switch is part of readying the entire system to be hurricane-ready. * By mid-July, the Toisa Pisces, a well-testing ship revamped to process up to 25,000 barrels a day, will be connected to the second blowout preventer hose via a floating pipe. * Both the Toisa Pisces and the Helix Producer will be accompanied by oil tankers that will carry collected oil to shore to be processed. * The Discoverer Enterprise and a second drillship, Transocean's Discoverer Clear Leader, will each be connected to the new containment cap via a drillpipe system. * The Q4000 will depart from the area. * The Toisa Pisces, Helix Producer, Enterprise and Clear Leader will have a combined capacity of up to 80,000 barrels a day. * The two drillships will siphon oil if needed. Otherwise, they will be on site to begin operating if the Toisa Pisces or Helix Producer have operational problems. * All four vessels will be able to disconnect quickly in the event of a storm. * If they disconnect, the oil leak will flow unchecked until they return and reconnect. * The Atlantic hurricane season began on June 1. OTHER BACKUPS * BP will bring 3,800 feet (1,160 metres) of extra hoses in case those at the seabed fail. * A floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel is being mobilized from South America to expand capacity by another 25,000 barrels a day if needed and fill in for the Toisa Pisces or Helix Producer if needed. ANOTHER HURRICANE-READY POSSIBILITY: * On June 22, U.S. Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen disclosed that BP is looking into designating one or more Gulf platforms to collect and process oil and gas from the leak. * Allen said the possibility was discussed at a private meeting the week of June 14 that included Energy Secretary Steven Chu and Interior Secretary Ken Salazar. * The system could involve fabricating and laying a new seabed pipeline to channel oil to one or more platforms. * The pipeline could also possibly be used to channel oil to an abandoned well and inject oil and gas back into a reservoir. * Allen said such a system, if realized, could provide a collection vessel that stays on site during hurricanes. Platforms are moored to the seabed and built to withstand storms, while drillships and rigs typically disconnect from seabed operations and move out of a hurricane's path. * No further details about how such a system could be installed or how it would work have been disclosed. THE RELIEF WELLS * Drilling continues on two relief wells intended to intercept the oil and cap the leaking well beneath the seabed. The first was begun on May 2 and the second on May 16. Both are expected to be finished in August. * The oil containment operations are stopgaps to minimize or corral the leak until the relief wells are drilled. (Reporting by Kristen Hays in Houston)
