 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said on Thursday his department is reviewing BP's plans for drilling in Alaska. 

 "We are looking into the issue right now," Salazar told lawmakers at a Senate Energy and Natural Resources committee hearing, when asked about reports that BP's planned Liberty project may not have received sufficient environmental review. The head of the recently renamed Minerals Management Service, Michael Bromwich, said they have reached out to the department's regional office in Alaska to get more details about the project's oversight.
