 LONDON  (Reuters) - Volkswagen ( VOWG_p.DE ) plans to shake up its management at Porsche SE ( PSHG_p.DE ), as it looks to strengthen its hold on the automaker, the Financial Times reported on Friday. 

 Citing people close to the situation the paper said Volkswagen Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn intended for Matthias Mueller to take charge of Porsche, in a move that could be announced in July. The paper said Porsche's current CEO Michael Macht was being touted as Volkswagen's head of production, replacing Jochem Heizmann who would take over responsibility for the truck operations on Volkswagen's management board. Last year Porsche acquiesced to a bailout, which would eventually see it being subsumed within the far larger and more solvent Volkswagen group sometime next year. Volkswagen could not immediately be reached for comment. (Reporting by  Caroline Copley ; Editing by  Lincoln Feast )
