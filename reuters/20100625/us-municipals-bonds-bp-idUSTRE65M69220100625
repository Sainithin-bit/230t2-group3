 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Moody's Investors Service on Wednesday downgraded the ratings on $500 million of Nebraska-based American Public Energy Agency gas supply revenue debt linked to BP Corp.. 

 The rating on long-term debt was cut to Baa1 from Aa3 and the short-term rating was downgraded to VMIG 3 from VMIG 1. "The downgrade is a result of the downgrade of BP Corporation North America, Inc's rating to Baa1 under review for further possible downgrade from Aa3," Moody's said in a statement. BP is the gas supplier for the Nebraska deals. (Reporting by  Karen Pierog ; Editing by Dan Grebler)
