 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives agreed on Wednesday to give subpoena power to the commission created by President Barack Obama to investigate BP Plc's Gulf of Mexico oil spill. 

 By an overwhelming vote of 420-1, the Democratic-led House passed a bill to grant the commission the power to compel witnesses to testify and produce evidence. The measure now goes to the Democratic Senate for anticipated concurrence. Obama issued an executive order last month to create the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Oil Drilling. Obama lacks the power to grant such a commission subpoena power, but Congress may do so, effectively giving it the ability to compel witnesses to testify and produce documents. "No member of Congress should be against giving the commission looking at this spill every tool in the toolbox to ensure that BP and other companies can't stonewall," said Democratic Representative Lois Capps, a chief sponsor of the measure. Last week, Senate Democrats tried to pass such legislation but Republicans managed to block it, at least temporarily. On Tuesday, however, Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski, the top Republican on the Senate Energy Committee, made it clear she supports giving the commission clout. "I don't have any problems with subpoena power," she told reporters, adding that she will include it in legislation she is crafting related to the BP spill.
