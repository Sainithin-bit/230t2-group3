 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - A $20 billion fund set up by energy giant BP Plc after the Gulf of Mexico oil spill should be used only to compensate victims, lawyers involved in litigation over the disaster said on Thursday. 

 The lawyers said they were shocked that the fund was also for purposes other than compensating people suffering economic losses from the worst oil spill in U.S. history. Those purposes could include massive clean-up costs and litigation. BP agreed to the fund under pressure from the White House as public anger runs high over the undersea leak that began at a BP deepwater well in April and continues to spew oil into the Gulf, damaging tourism, fisheries and fragile ecosystems. "That was sold to the American public as a compensation fund. And now we have learned that they can use it for whatever the heck they want to use it for," said Robert Kennedy, an environmental lawyer and activist. "It's another subterfuge by BP, one of the many that we have discovered recently," Kennedy told Reuters at a conference in Atlanta on litigation over the spill. The money can be used for a variety of purposes but compensation is central, said Michael Rozen, a partner in the Feinberg Rozen law firm charged with administering the fund. Kenneth Feinberg, the firm's founder, was named by the White House to oversee the process. To focus on the spill fund, Feinberg will step down from his role as the U.S. Treasury's "pay czar" this summer. The White House and Feinberg have said the $20 billion does not necessarily represent the ceiling of what BP could be asked to pay. "My present understanding is ... that it is available for all manner of costs," Rozen said, stressing that all legitimate claimants would be paid. "Twenty billion maybe isn't sufficient for the mass of stuff that's aired, in which case BP will have to add more. If that should be the case, people still have their rights and remedies under law." The British energy giant faces the costs of compensation, spill clean-up, lawsuits and setting up the fund after a verbal agreement that is now being put in writing, Rozen said. News that the fund can have other purposes amounts to a trick because the public expects all of the money to be used to compensate victims, said prominent toxic tort lawyers Mike Papantonio and Perry Weitz. They estimated clean-up costs alone could amount to $30 billion in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida. "Imagine if BP uses a significant portion for clean-up costs," Weitz said at the spill litigation conference. "What's left for the victims?" (Editing by  Tom Brown  and  John O'Callaghan )
