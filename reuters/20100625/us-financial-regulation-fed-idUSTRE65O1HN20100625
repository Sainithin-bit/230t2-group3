 (Reuters) - After being subject to harsh criticism for lapses during the financial crisis, the U.S. Federal Reserve emerged from an overhaul of financial regulations with a broader role in policing system-wide risk and most of its zealously guarded independence intact. 

 The reforms are part of a broader regulatory overhaul meant to prevent a repeat of the 2007-09 financial crisis that tipped the economy into a deep recession and triggered massive taxpayer bailouts of big banks. Lawmakers from the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate have melded versions of regulatory reform and are expected to send a bill to President Barack Obama to sign into law before the July 4 holiday. Following is a look at provisions that affect the Federal Reserve: CONSUMER PROTECTION An independent Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection would be set up within the Fed. It would be funded by the Fed, although it could turn to Congress if it saw the need for funding. The agency would have power to write and enforce consumer protection rules. The Fed would not be able to intervene in actions of the bureau or review or delay its rules. SYSTEMIC RISK REGULATION The Fed would be part of an inter-agency Financial Stability Oversight Council chaired by the secretary of the Treasury to watch for dangers that could roil the wider financial system, giving the Fed some powers to take action. The Fed could be put in charge of supervising large non-bank financial firms the council deems systemically risky. It would be able to break up those firms to guard against risks. EMERGENCY LENDING The Fed could no longer use its emergency lending authority to help a specific company, as it did during the crisis with Bear Stearns and American International Group. Instead, it would have to create a lending facility open to firms of a certain type, as it did with Wall Street investment banks and commercial paper markets. AUDITS AND DISCLOSURE The Fed's emergency lending during the 2007-09 crisis would be subject to a congressional audit, as would any future special emergency lending. The Fed would be required to make public information about borrowing at emergency facilities a year after each facility closes. Borrowing at the Fed's discount window and transactions at its open market desk would be made public after a two-year lag. Both of those facilities, whose operations are part of the Fed's ongoing activities, would be subject to congressional audit. GOVERNANCE The president would name a Fed vice chairman for supervision. Bankers supervised by the Fed who serve on the boards of directors of the 12 regional Fed banks would lose the ability to vote for the presidents of those regional Fed banks. Lawmakers agreed to an audit of Fed system governance by the Government Accountability Office. (For stories on Fed policy, please double-click on)
