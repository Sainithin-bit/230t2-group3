 BERLIN  (Reuters) - German President Horst Koehler on Saturday signed into law a bill allowing Europe's biggest economy to contribute to a 750 billion euro ($942.7 billion) emergency debt package, his office said in a statement. 

 The law authorizes Germany to contribute some 148 billion euros in guarantees to the international package, despite broad public opposition to the move in Germany. (Reporting by  Brian Rohan )
