 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. prices crept persistently higher in February and industrial output rose at an unexpectedly strong pace, according to data on Friday that implied little or no chance of interest-rate cuts soon. 


 A Reuters/University of Michigan report implied a litany of bad news about layoffs, softer stock and home prices and mortgage defaults was dampening consumers' spirits, but likely not enough to persuade Federal Reserve policy-makers meeting next week to alter their steady-as-it-goes rate policy. "With the economy softening, the FOMC members would probably like to start signaling that a cut was coming, but I doubt they can," said economist Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. The policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee meets Tuesday and Wednesday and is expected to again leave its trendsetting federal funds rate at 5.25 percent, where it has been at since June. The Consumer Price Index compiled by the Labor Department rose 0.4 percent after a 0.2 percent January rise, while core prices were up 0.2 percent after a 0.3 percent January gain. WATCHING AND WARY Wall Street analysts had forecast a more moderate 0.3 percent gain in overall prices but correctly anticipated the 0.2 percent rise in core costs, which exclude food and energy prices. "The only thing you can conclude ... is that we're still in this situation that we've been in the last eight months: watchful of the trend in inflation," said Kathleen Camilli, president of Camilli Economics in New York. Stock prices suffered because of the possibility that inflation worries, if they continue, potentially could trigger higher interest rates to keep prices in check. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  fell 49 points to end at 12,110 and the Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  slipped 6 points or 0.3 percent. Bond prices were mixed within narrow ranges, as investors paid more attention to stocks. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes US10YT=RR traded 1/32 lower in price for a yield of 4.55 percent. Thirty-year bonds US30YT=RR gained 1/32 in price for a yield of 4.70 percent. The Fed said industrial production shot up by 1 percent last month -- five times the 0.2 percent rise that had been forecast. But the jump was partly due to a cold weather-induced 6.7 percent jump in output by utilities last month, the biggest increase since a 7 percent gain more than 17 years ago in December 1989. Manufacturing was solid in February, with production rising 0.4 percent after a 0.5 percent decline in January. Motor vehicles output was up 3.1 percent last month after a 5.8 percent fall in January. In the consumer sentiment report, the key index for March slipped to 88.8 from 91.3 in the previous month. It was the weakest reading for the index in six months, but the survey noted the decline was concentrated in richer households and said it was "not consistent with an emerging downturn." On a year-over-year basis, core consumer prices were up 2.7 percent last month, the same rise as in January. That implied no sign that prices were decelerating as the Fed wants to see. HARD TO RATCHET DOWN "The big message is that there's no progress against core inflation, and (the CPI report) hints that progress will not be easy," said Pierre Ellis, New York-based senior economist with Decision Economics Inc. Energy prices climbed 0.9 percent in February, a peak winter heating period, after registering a 1.5 percent decline in January. Natural gas prices jumped 5 percent last month, the largest increase since October 2005 when they were up 14.2 percent. Food prices continued to rise sharply, up 0.8 percent in February after a 0.7 percent January increase. It was the largest rise in overall food prices since a matching increase in April 2005. Analysts played down the significance of the sharp rise in industrial output, noting the role of cold weather. "The 1.0 percent increase in industrial production overstates the strength because much of the gain was due to increased utility output which was due to the weather change, rather than to economic fundamentals," said Michael Moran, chief economist for Daiwa Securities America in New York.
