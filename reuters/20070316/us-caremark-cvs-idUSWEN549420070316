 NASHVILLE  (Reuters) - Drug-store chain CVS Corp. won the battle to buy Caremark Rx Inc. on Friday, as the pharmacy benefit manager's shareholders approved the $24 billion deal, thwarting a higher bid from Caremark rival Express Scripts Inc. 


 Caremark CMX.N said a "substantial majority" of outstanding shares were cast in favor of the merger. CVS ( CVS.N ) said it expects the deal to close by the middle of next week after the vote is certified. The deal will allow CVS, which already has more U.S. stores than any other drugstore chain, to expand its prescription benefits business and mail-order operations at a time when traditional pharmacies are under pressure from such mail-delivery facilities. "We have said from the beginning that this combination will transform the way pharmacy services are delivered," CVS Chief Executive Officer Tom Ryan said in a statement. CVS did not raise its original stock offer, which calls for Caremark shareholders to receive 1.67 CVS shares for each Caremark share. But CVS did sweeten its bid with a special dividend of $7.50 per share, which will be paid to Caremark shareholders once the deal closes. By comparison, Express Scripts' ( ESRX.O ) deal was valued at about $28 billion. "We have constantly put ourselves in a position to benefit shareholders," Caremark CEO Mac Crawford told reporters after the meeting in Nashville . OPTIMISM FOR CVS, EXPRESS Analysts said the conclusion of the takeover battle could bode well for both CVS and Express Scripts. Goldman Sachs analyst John Heinbockel said CVS' shares could rise another 5 percent in the near term as the stock benefits from technical issues related to short-selling, an upcoming tender offer, and the lack of negative comments from Express. "As 'new' CVS's enhanced growth prospects and stronger returns become recognized by the market, we expect the shares to trade solidly higher," Heinbockel said in a research note. The Caremark battle has thrust pharmacy benefit managers into Wall Street's spotlight. The companies administer prescription drug benefits for employers and health plans. For its part, Express Scripts said in February it would increase its share buyback should it lose out on Caremark. Jeffries & Co. analyst Arthur Henderson said in a research note he remained "enthusiastic" about Express Scripts' growth prospects and forecast further consolidation. "Either way, Express Scripts is sitting pretty as a consolidator or as an acquisition target," Henderson said. SAGA COMES TO END The vote ended a bitter battle underscored by heated rhetoric as the companies vied to win over investors using a litany of press releases and newspaper advertisements. Caremark agreed to be acquired by Woonsocket, Rhode Island-based CVS in an all-stock deal in November. However, the CVS offer initially valued Caremark with no premium. St. Louis-based Express Scripts joined the fray in December with an unsolicited cash and stock offer for Caremark, and sued to stop the friendly CVS offer from proceeding as planned. In the end, a judge postponed a shareholder vote but stopped short of canceling the vote. All along, Express Scripts' offer was higher than CVS' bid. But Express Scripts had not yet won U.S. antitrust clearance as regulators earlier this month asked for more information on the deal. Express Scripts sweetened its bid earlier this month, and said on Thursday it was "firmly committed" to raising the cash part of its offer if it could find more synergies. But Express added that Caremark would not open its books. Institutional Shareholder Services, the most influential proxy advisory firm, recommended that CVS and Caremark shareholders support the deal, but other advisors, such as CtW Investment Group, were against it. Calpers, the largest U.S. pension fund, voted its shares of Caremark and CVS against the deal. CVS will pay the special cash dividend to Caremark shareholders once the deal closes. CVS also plans a tender offer to retire 150 million of CVS/Caremark's outstanding shares -- or about 10 percent of the combined company -- part of the sweetened offer it presented in January, along with the special dividend. CVS shareholders had approved the takeover plan on Thursday. Shares of Caremark rose 27.5 percent from October 31 -- the day before CVS and Caremark confirmed that they were discussing a possible merger -- to Thursday's close. Caremark shares fell 37 cents to $62.38 Friday on the New York Stock Exchange. CVS shares fell 40 cents to $32.94. Express Scripts shares rose 7 cents to $82.48 on the Nasdaq.
