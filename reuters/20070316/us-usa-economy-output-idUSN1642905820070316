 Corrects 7th paragraph to read: "Industrial output..." rather than the subcomponent "Manufacturing output..." 


 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. industrial output posted its biggest gain in more than a year, rising a much larger-than-expected 1.0 percent in February, fueled by motor vehicles, high-tech and utilities, a government report said on Friday. Analysts had widely anticipated a rebound but the gain was five times bigger than Wall Street expectations of a 0.2 percent increase seen in a Reuters poll of economists. January was upwardly revised to a drop of 0.3 percent after previously being reported down 0.5 percent, the Federal Reserve said. A gain in December was also revised upward. February's output advance was the biggest since a 1.1 percent gain in November 2005. Motor vehicle and parts production rose 3.1 percent in February, partly offsetting a 5.8 percent drop in January. Manufacturing as a whole rose 0.4 percent after a 0.5 percent decline the prior month. Nonetheless, motor vehicle and parts output was down 3.3 percent from a year ago. Industrial output excluding motor vehicles and parts was up a solid 0.8 percent in February. Utility output climbed 6.7 percent, the biggest gain since a 7.0 percent rise in December 1989, after a 2.2 percent increase the prior month. Mining production edged up 0.1 percent after falling 1.3 percent the prior month. High-tech industries posted a 3.2 percent gain in output after a 2.1 percent increase the prior month. High-tech output was up 29.4 percent from a year ago. The capacity use rate of factories, mines and utilities rose to a five-month high of 82.0 percent in February from a revised 81.4 percent in January, previously estimated at 81.2 percent. Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted the overall cap use rate would be 81.3 percent in February. Capacity use of manufacturing edged up to 80.1 percent from 79.9 percent the prior month. Capacity use of mining was unchanged at 91.2 percent. Utilities climbed to 90.4 percent from 84.8 percent.
