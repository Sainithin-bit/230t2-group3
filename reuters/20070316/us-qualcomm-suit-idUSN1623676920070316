 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Wireless chip maker Qualcomm Inc. ( QCOM.O ) and rival Broadcom Corp. ( BRCM.O ) agreed on Friday to dismiss all patent and trade secret claims pending in a San Diego federal court, eliminating the need for five jury trials scheduled for this year. 


 The agreement dismisses claims against each other under six Broadcom patents and four Qualcomm patents, leaving intact their disputes in federal court in Orange County, California, and before the U.S. International Trade Commission, the companies said. Qualcomm and Broadcom have filed multiple patent-infringement cases against each other. But in February, they agreed to dismiss certain patent claims in the San Diego court before deciding to end their legal fight in that venue. Yet it is just one of many legal battles faced by Qualcomm, the dominant supplier of chips for cell phones based on CDMA, the most widely used U.S. cellular technology, and a supplier of chips based on W-CMDA, a popular technology in Europe. Apart from the lawsuits against Broadcom, Qualcomm faces regulatory complaints in Europe about its competition practices from several large rivals including Broadcom. Broadcom has asked the International Trade Commission to ban U.S. sales of certain Qualcomm chips and cell phones that include those chips. The ITC had been expected to decide on the case in early February but has extended its target date for a decision until May 8 after a hearing scheduled for March.
