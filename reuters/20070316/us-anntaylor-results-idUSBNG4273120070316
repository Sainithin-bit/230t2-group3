 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Women's apparel retailer AnnTaylor Stores Corp. ( ANN.N ) posted better-than-expected quarterly profit on Friday and forecast earnings for the year above the average Wall Street estimate, sending its shares up as much as 7 percent. 


 For the fourth quarter, ended February 3, the company reported lower earnings, hurt by unseasonably warm weather across much of the country and a fashion miss at LOFT stores. But the results beat analysts' forecasts, and the retailer said it expects first-half softness at LOFT, where it has reduced prices to spur sales, to be followed by improving trends in the second half. Additionally, the company said during a conference call that business at Loft, which offers more relaxed fashions, was looking better in March. Sales at stores open at least a year have fallen at the division in recent months. "Loft's business right now going into March is a little better than we thought it would be," Chief Executive Kay Krill said. "We are seeing strength across businesses that have been soft recently." Net income for the fourth quarter was $21.5 million, or 31 cents per share, down from $27.4 million, or 38 cents per share, a year earlier. Net sales for the quarter, which had one more week compared with the year-ago period, rose 6.3 percent to $610.5 million. Analysts on average had expected the New York-based company, which operates LOFT as well as its flagship Ann Taylor chain, to earn 29 cents per share on revenue of $605.6 million, according to Reuters Estimates. Taking into account the expected improvement in its LOFT division in the second half, the company forecast earnings for the full year of $2.15 to $2.25 a share. It forecast that sales at stores open at least a year would grow in the low single digits. Analysts' average profit forecast for the year is $2.11 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. AnnTaylor said its board had authorized a $300 million share buyback plan. AnnTaylor shares were up $2.13 to $37.80 in early New York Stock Exchange trading after touching a high of $38.50. So far this year the stock is up nearly 14 percent. (Additional Reporting by Rakesh Sharma in Bangalore)
