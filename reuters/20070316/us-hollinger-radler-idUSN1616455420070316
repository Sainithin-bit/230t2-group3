 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The former chief operating officer of media company Hollinger International Inc. has agreed to pay $28.7 million to settle fraud charges, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said on Friday. 


 The SEC alleges the executive, David Radler, and Conrad Black, Hollinger International's former CEO, who is on trial in Chicago, engaged in a fraudulent scheme to divert cash and assets from the company from 1999 through 2003. The SEC accused Radler of misappropriating millions of dollars from the Chicago-based company and making numerous misstatements to shareholders. Radler, who was also deputy chairman of Hollinger International, agreed to pay $23.7 million in disgorgement and $5 million in civil penalties. He was also barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, the SEC said. He agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying the charges. An attorney for Radler had no comment on the settlement. "The tough sanctions in this settlement, including one of the largest civil penalties in recent years against an individual wrongdoer, reflect our resolve to act forcefully against corporate officers who perpetrate fraud against those whom they were supposed to serve, the shareholders of the company," SEC enforcement director Linda Thomsen said in a statement. The SEC alleges Black and Radler diverted to themselves, other corporate insiders and Hollinger Inc. about $85 million of the proceeds of Hollinger International's sale of newspaper publications through supposed "non-competition" payments. Hollinger Inc. was Toronto-based holding company. Hollinger International, now called Sun-Times Media Group Inc., was once a worldwide media giant under Black's control. It sold off hundreds of Canadian and U.S. newspapers, as well as London's Daily Telegraph and the Jerusalem Post. The SEC also accused Black and Radler of selling certain newspaper publications at below-market prices as low as $1 to another private company owned by them. Radler has pleaded guilty to a single fraud count in a criminal case and agreed to testify against Black. Black is insisting that charges of pilfering millions in proceeds from his crumbling media empire represent the persecution of the powerful.
