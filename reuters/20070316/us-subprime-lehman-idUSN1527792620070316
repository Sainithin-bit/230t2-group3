 SEATTLE  (Reuters) - A Wall Street fixed income strategist warned on Thursday that the greatest risk investors face is for the troubled U.S. subprime lending sector to trigger a spiral of falling home prices and mortgage defaults. 


 There is not enough evidence to indicate such a scenario is taking place, but the risk of a broader market impact is "very real," Adam Topalian, fixed income strategist at Lehman Brothers, said at a dinner for investment professionals. The test will be whether lenders tighten up when $900 billion in adjustable rate mortgages -- including $650 billion from high-risk borrowers -- reset in the next two years, Topalian said at the CFA Society of Seattle's annual forecast dinner. "Any kind of sharp pullback in lending could lead to a vicious spiral of continued housing price depreciation and defaults," said Topalian. "This does have the potential to feed on itself and it's a real concern." Topalian believed, however, it was unlikely that defaults in subprime loans would derail the U.S. economy. At least 20 companies in subprime mortgage lending have gone out of business in recent months as defaults and foreclosures have risen in the wake of rising interest rates and falling U.S. house prices in the past year. The strategist dismissed the notion that high-risk home loans were limited to only certain areas and neighborhoods and cited data that 60 percent of U.S. zip codes have between 25 percent and 75 percent subprime home borrowers.
