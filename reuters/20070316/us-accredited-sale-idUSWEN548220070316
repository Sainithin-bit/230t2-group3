 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Accredited Home Lenders Holding Co. LEND.O, a big U.S. subprime lender hit by a cash squeeze, said on Friday it will sell $2.7 billion in loans, a move that buys it more time and sent its stock up 27 percent in early trading. 


 Earlier this week, shares of Accredited and other subprime lenders plunged amid fears they would run out of cash. The sale, expected to be completed within days, will result in a pretax charge of about $150 million. The loans will be sold at a substantial discount in order to alleviate recent pressures from margin calls, the company said. Accredited, which make loans to people with poor credit histories, said earlier in the week it needed to raise cash after paying $190 million demanded by lenders. The company said the sale of the loans will provide much needed funds and give it more time to explore strategic options, including potentially raising additional capital. Default rates in the subprime segment of the U.S. mortgage market have jumped in recent months as the housing industry slowed and prices fell. At least 20 lenders in the subprime mortgage sector, which serves borrowers with poor credit histories at high interest rates, have gone out of business as a result. The crisis has triggered broader concerns that the fallout may spread to mainstream lenders and damage the economy. The buyers of the Accredited loans were not disclosed. San Diego-based Accredited also expects to record a charge of about $130 million in the quarter ended December 31, reflecting all the goodwill associated with its acquisition of Aames Investment Corp. last October. Accredited said it was continuing to seek waivers and extensions of waivers of some financial and operating covenants from creditors. Accredited stock has more than doubled in the past two days on speculation the company would get a capital injection or a takeover bid. Shares hit a low of $3.77 on Tuesday as the crisis over subprime mortgages deepened. The stock rose to $12.02 in early electronic trading from the close of $9.43 on Nasdaq on Thursday. Accredited said its loans are funded out of warehouse and repurchase credit facilities, an asset-backed commercial paper facility and its equity. Terms of the sale include a holdback reserve of approximately $40 million to satisfy all future claims against the loans, including early payment defaults. Claims in excess of the reserve will have no recourse against the company. Accredited will keep approximately $120 million in loans held for sale in warehouse facilities, comprised mostly of loans originated since March 7. CHANGE IN GOODWILL The company reiterated it will not file its annual report by Friday as it changes the amount of goodwill recorded from its Aames takeover last year. The new goodwill figure of $130 million reflects the difference between Aames' fair value and its market price when the deal was announced in May 2006. Previously, Accredited calculated goodwill based on Aames market value when the deal closed on October 1. Accredited said it determined that the entire amount of goodwill established has been impaired and will be charged off. The charge-off will not affect operations, tangible book equity, cash or liquidity, the company said. Accredited added it is still evaluating whether it can realize deferred tax assets acquired from Aames. (Additional reporting by Joe Giannone)
