 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Hitachi Ltd. ( 6501.T ) said on Friday it expects to post a parent-only net loss of 200 billion yen ($1.7 billion) for this business year, down from its previous estimate of a 55 billion yen loss due to appraisal losses on its hard disk drive operations. 


 It left unchanged its group-based net loss forecast of 55 billion yen for the year ending March 31. Hitachi said its hard disk drive unit is likely to fall into a deeper loss in the first three months of 2007 than a year earlier due to steep price declines, prompting the sprawling electronics conglomerate to book the paper loss. The Tokyo-based company posted an operating loss of 5.4 billion yen for the January-March period a year earlier. "Since this January, we have seen steeper-than-expected price falls, mainly for 2.5-inch drives, and that is likely to hit earnings at the unit," a Hitachi spokesman said. Its 2.5-inch drives are mainly used in notebook computers. Hitachi bought International Business Machines Corp.'s ( IBM.N ) disk drive operations in 2002 for $2 billion, but the unit together with its flat TV operations have been a major drag on Hitachi's earnings. Of the appraisal losses of about 180 billion yen that Hitachi plans to post on an unconsolidated basis, the hard disk drive unit accounts for 160 billion yen. Hitachi has no plan to revise its consolidated earnings forecasts as the value of its group assets is adjusted periodically and reflected in its financial statements. Prior to the announcement, shares in Hitachi closed up 0.8 percent at 863 yen, outperforming the Tokyo stock market's electrical machinery index .IELEC.T, which gained 0.32 percent. ($1=116.82 Yen)
