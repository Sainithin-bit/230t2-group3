 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Tribune Co. TRB.N may pare back a restructuring plan even as the company's interest in bids from outside investors dwindles, media reports said on Friday. 


 Shares in Tribune fell more than 2 percent, deepening a slide that began on Thursday after its Chicago Tribune newspaper reported the company's interest in a late-breaking offer by Chicago real estate magnate Sam Zell was waning. The publisher and TV broadcaster likely will press ahead with a "self-help" plan that involves taking on debt to pay a shareholder dividend, spinning off its TV station group and selling the Chicago Cubs baseball team, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter. But due to declines in print advertising revenues, the company may opt to borrow less money and pay a smaller dividend than originally thought, the Journal reported. Zell's bid, meanwhile, is "losing steam," the New York Times reported, citing people close to the situation. One of the sources was cited as saying Tribune's options amounted to a "painful set of bad choices." Zell's bid is worth $13 billion, with $300 million coming from his own pocket, Barron's reported on Saturday. Tribune is reviewing bids that include buying out the company and spinning off divisions as it tries to satisfy restive investors. Shares fell 67 cents to $28.95, coming closer to a 52-week low of $27.09 on April 6. Tribune shares had traded as high as $34.28 in September after the company said it was reviewing its options.
