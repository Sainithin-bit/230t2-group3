 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Tribune Co. TRB.N is re-evaluating 
the economics of its restructuring plan even as its interest in 
a late-breaking offer from real estate magnate Sam Zell 
dwindles, according to people familiar with the matter, The 
Wall Street Journal reported. 


  The newspaper and television concern is still likely to 
press ahead with the so-called self-help restructuring, which 
would involve taking on debt to pay a dividend to shareholders, 
spinning off its TV-station group and selling the Chicago Cubs 
baseball team, these people said, the Journal reported.  But faced with continued declines in print advertising 
revenues, the company may opt to borrow less money and pay a 
smaller dividend than originally thought.  Chicago-based Tribune, which currently owns 11 daily papers 
in such cities as New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, is 
reviewing bids that include buying out the company and spinning 
off divisions as it tries to satisfy restive investors.  The company has a market value of $30.8 billion. Its shares 
closed down 1.66 percent on Thursday at $29.62.
