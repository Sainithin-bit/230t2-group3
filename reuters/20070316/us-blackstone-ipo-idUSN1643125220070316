 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Private equity firm Blackstone Group is deep into preparations for an initial public offering, according to a report on Friday, a move that would counter the negative view of public markets held by its CEO. 


 Blackstone BG.UL is working with investment bank Goldman Sachs Group Inc. ( GS.N ) on an IPO prospectus for all of the firm that could be filed in the next couple of weeks, business news TV channel CNBC said. Most IPOs require several underwriters, so other investment banks are likely to be involved if the firm goes through with an offering. The report added that the ultimate decision has not been made yet. Blackstone and Goldman Sachs declined to comment on the report. "It's major news in that not long ago (CEO Stephen Schwarzman) maligned the idea as a non-starter," said Scott Sweet, managing director for IPO research firm IPOboutique.com. Bankers and private equity investors have long expected Blackstone and other large buyout firms with multiple funds to spin off some divisions to diversify. Carlyle Group is launching a public, debt-related fund in Europe, a source close to the firm has said.  But the CNBC report said Blackstone plans to float the entire company. Blackstone's Schwarzman has repeatedly said he is not interested in an IPO for the firm or its divisions. "I think the public markets are overrated," he said during a panel discussion on February 27 at the annual Super Return private equity conference. Private equity firms, which buy and sell companies, have pursued public offerings because it allows them to diversify and raise money quickly without having to go to institutional investors on a long and costly fund-raising tour. According to IPO experts, valuing the firm is difficult because it is a private entity with multiple funds and divisions -- not to mention numerous fee channels. The New York-based firm says it has raised more than $64 billion across its private equity, real estate, corporate debt, distressed debt and marketable alternative investments groups. Through June 30, 2006, Blackstone said it had invested total capital of $24.1 billion in 318 transactions with a total enterprise value of over $198 billion through its Private Equity, Real Estate, and Mezzanine funds and over $5.1 billion across 439 different senior loan and other debt instruments through its Corporate Debt funds. The firm has 750 employees. When referring to a rival that had pursued an offering that came up short, Schwarzman said: "To divert yourself like that and then take on that cost, is really not worth it." Among Blackstone's recent deals are the $22.9 billion purchase of U.S. landlord Equity Office Properties Trust and the $17.6 billion buyout of Freescale Semiconductor. The report on Blackstone's IPO plans come amid speculation that more private equity and hedge funds will seek public money after the IPO last month of Fortress Investment Group LLC ( FIG.N ), a private investment fund that raised more than $600 million. The shares of Fortress, the first U.S. listed hedge fund, jumped 89 percent to $35 during its February 9 market debut, a day after it raised $634 million with a 34.3 million Class A share offering that sold for $18.50. But Fortress lost much of its appeal amid the general market turbulence that has included a global sell off and the tumble of the subprime mortgage market, and its shares have dropped almost 25 percent from their highs. They were trading at $26.55 each on Friday afternoon. In a recent interview on CNBC, Schwarzman said the emphasis on quarterly earnings for public companies "discourages risk taking." When asked in the interview about an IPO, Schwarzman said: "Every banker has talked to every company that's in the private equity and hedge fund business above a certain size. I mean, it's like a national sport at this point." Less than two years ago, Schwarzman told the channel that Blackstone was "absolutely not considering" an IPO. An offering of the whole firm would reveal the compensation earned by top executives at Blackstone, something it and most of its peers have held tightly. Blackstone's success has made Schwarzman a very wealthy man worth $2.5 billion, according to Forbes.
