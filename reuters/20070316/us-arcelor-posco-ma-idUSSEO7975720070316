 SEOUL  (Reuters) - Arcelor Mittal ( MT.N ) CELR.PA, the world's biggest steel maker, could be interested in making a hostile takeover of South Korean steel maker POSCO Co. Ltd. ( 005490.KS ), the Korea Economic Daily said on Friday. 


 Citing an unnamed POSCO executive, the paper reported that a senior Arcelor Mittal executive expressed interest in POSCO's M&A strategy when he visited Seoul last month to meet POSCO chief executive Lee Ku-taek. "That means that Arcelor Mittal has put POSCO on its M&A target list," the POSCO executive told the newspaper. "The top management is pondering how to react to a potential hostile takeover bid," the paper quoted the source as saying. At Thursday's close of 388,500 won POSCO is worth 33.87 trillion won ($35.87 billion). POSCO, the world's third-largest steel maker, has a fragmented, foreign dominated share ownership and is seen by some as a prime target for a takeover in the wave of global consolidation that began last year when Mittal bought Arcelor to create Arcelor Mittal. A POSCO spokeswoman could not confirm the report immediately.
