 LONDON  (Reuters) - Sterling jumped against the dollar and euro on Thursday after the Bank of England kept its quantitative easing target unchanged, surprising markets which had expected the central bank to expand its asset buying scheme. 

 The BoE left the target at 125 billion pounds. Markets had expected the central bank to expand the total by 25 billion pounds, which would have allowed the central bank to pump money into the economy until August when it publishes new quarterly economic forecasts. The central bank left key interest rates unchanged at 0.5 percent, as widely expected. Sterling jumped to a session high of $1.6272 from around $1.6170 shortly before the announcement. By 1412 GMT, it was up 1.0 percent at $1.6226. The euro was down 0.4 percent at 86.06 pence, after falling as low as 85.84 pence. "Part of sterling's weakness recently came on the back of expectations that the BoE would announce extra QE, and the fact that it did nothing will help sterling today," Brown Brothers Harriman currency strategist Audrey Childe-Freeman said. "You have to bear in mind that they haven't ruled out further QE altogether." The BoE said it would review the program in August, when it releases its quarterly Inflation Report. Analysts said the BoE tended to make major decisions in months it publishes new forecasts, and would expand its asset buying program next month. "It may just be a matter of timing with an increase at the August meeting and it may be more aggressive than another 25 billion," said Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec. But others took Thursday's decision as a sign the BoE was preparing to shut off the spigot of ample cash for good. "The MPC has sent a clear signal that the endgame for QE has arrived," said Ross Walker, UK economist at RBS. "The Bank has not completely closed the door to further gilt or private credit purchases, but it seems unlikely that there will be a significant increase in asset purchases beyond August." Sterling got a boost early in the day as equity markets rose. London's FTSE index was up 0.7 percent by afternoon trade. Stop-losses were hit near $1.6140 as speculative players pushed sterling to above $1.6200, traders said. "The decision not to expand QE for now provoked a knee-jerk boost to sterling, but one which has petered out perhaps because the pound already had such a good start to the day," said Daragh Maher, deputy head of global FX strategy at Calyon. Data on Thursday showed Britain's trade deficit narrowed to 6.263 billion pounds in May from 7.137 billion in April, much lower than the 6.75 billion pound gap forecast by analysts and the smallest deficit since June 2006, as imports from non-EU countries fell. Dismal economic data earlier this week has weighed on the pound as the figures reinforced views Britain's economy has yet to show any clear signs of recovery. Industrial output posted an unexpected fall in May while house prices also declined, albeit at a slower pace. Markets were shocked last week after revised data showed the UK economy shrank by 2.4 percent in the first quarter, its worst performance since 1958.
