 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Asset manager BlackRock Inc ( BLK.N ) plans to raise between $4 billion and $5 billion for a U.S. federal program that disposes of toxic assets, a spokeswoman said. 

 That would be far above the minimum investment required under the Treasury Department's Legacy Securities Public-Private Investment Program. BlackRock spokeswoman Bobbi Collins said the firm will raise the money through financing, private capital and government funds. (Reporting by  Ross Kerber ; editing by  Andre Grenon )
