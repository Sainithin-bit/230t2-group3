 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wall Street and European shares rose on Friday as investors were relieved that U.S. jobs figures did not live up to pessimists' worst fears after a deluge of horrific economic reports this week. 

 U.S. President-elect Barack Obama said fixing the economy would take time, which removed some of the froth from stocks' gains, but he added that economic stimulus, job creation and help for the auto industry were top priorities. U.S. employers slashed an unexpectedly steep 240,000 jobs in October but financial markets had braced for a much worse outcome in the days before release of the data. Bargain hunters bought beaten-down stocks after the report and equities' exuberance pummeled government bonds, which generally benefit more from weak economic news. However, the jobs report gave few signs of hope for the future and Obama's news conference illustrated the high level of anxiety in markets to learn how the new leadership in Washington will tackle the economic slump. "He is showing he will be ready to hit the ground running and that should provide some confidence to markets," said Greg Salvaggio, senior currency trader at Tempus Consulting in Washington. "But the truth is that this economy is hemorrhaging. The jobs report earlier today was awful, news from General Motors were awful and his comments today won't be able to change that." The price of oil, which is sensitive to economic growth prospects, overcame losses to rise back near $61 a barrel and gold also gained. The U.S. dollar slipped against the euro. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  ended up 248.02 points, or 2.85 percent, at 8,943.81. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was up 25.87 points, or 2.86 percent, at 930.75. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was up 38.70 points, or 2.41 percent, at 1,647.40. The 4.09 pct drop for the Dow this week marked the worst presidential election week for blue chips since Harry Truman upset Thomas Dewey in 1948. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  rose 1.84 percent. Japan's Nikkei average  .N225  dropped 3.6 percent. Payrolls data showed the world's largest economy shed many more jobs than first estimated during August and September, lifting total cuts to 1.2 million so far this year. "I think the numbers are weak across the board but I think they were well anticipated," said Thomas di Galoma, head of U.S. Treasury trading at Jefferies & Co in New York, adding: "It needed to be down 350,000 to really get the market rolling." BURNING MONEY Obama, at his first formal news conference since Tuesday's election victory, said help for the distressed U.S. auto industry is a high priority of his transition team. Obama urged the Bush administration to do "everything it can" to accelerate disbursement of $25 billion in advanced technology loans to the industry. General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) burned through $6.9 billion of cash in the third quarter and warned earlier on Friday that its cash holdings would fall short of the minimum needed to run its business without new funding or other drastic action. Markets have been volatile as big developed economies head for their first full-year contraction since World War Two. Industry surveys this week showed U.S. manufacturing suffered its worst slump in 26 years and a key gauge of the service sector posted the lowest reading in its 11 years. Those reports also indicated a sharp deterioration in employment and were accompanied by news that U.S. private employers made their deepest job cuts in six years last month and that companies' planned layoffs surged to the highest in nearly five years. The reports were further evidence that the United States is in the grips of the worst financial crisis in 80 years, which has spread its debilitating economic effects around the globe at an increasingly rapid rate in recent months. It all started with this decade's boom and bust in the U.S. housing market, and there were further signs of problems in this sector on Friday. Pending sales of existing U.S. homes fell in September. RELIEF REIGNS Still, Wall Street's relief rally reigned supreme on Friday, sending government bonds lower. "Treasuries were priced for Armageddon and we didn't get Armageddon," said Kevin Flanagan, a fixed income strategist at Morgan Stanley's wealth management arm in Purchase, New York. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was down 22/32, with the yield at 3.77 percent. The euro was up 0.37 percent at $1.2747 from a previous session close of $1.2700. U.S. light sweet crude oil rose 18 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $60.95 per barrel, and gold rose $2.10, or 0.29 percent, to $734.60.
