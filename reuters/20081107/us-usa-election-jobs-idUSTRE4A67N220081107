 (Reuters) - The ill health of the U.S. economy is likely to leave a lasting mark on President George W. Bush's legacy. 

 Since he took office in January 2001, the economy has added a relatively slim 4.43 million jobs. Following are details on nonfarm employment dating back to the beginning of President Franklin Roosevelt's first term in 1933: Franklin D. Roosevelt, 1933-45 First term: +5.44 million (estimated; see note *) Second term: +3.29 million (*) Third term: +7.42 million Partial fourth term: -460,000 jobs Total: +15.69 million (*) Harry Truman, 1945-53 Partial First term: +3.23 million jobs Second term: +5.47 million jobs Total: +8.70 million jobs Dwight Eisenhower, 1953-61 First term: +2.74 million jobs Second term: +795,000 jobs Total: +3.54 million jobs John F. Kennedy, 1961-63 Partial term: +3.57 million jobs Lyndon Johnson, 1963-69 Partial term: +2.33 million jobs Full term: +9.86 million jobs Total: +12.18 million jobs Richard Nixon, 1969-74 First term: +6.18 million Partial term: +3 million jobs Total: +9.18 million jobs Gerald Ford, 1974-77 Partial term: +2.07 million jobs Jimmy Carter, 1977-81 First term: +10.34 million jobs Ronald Reagan, 1981-89 First term: +5.32 million jobs Second term: +10.78 million jobs Total: +16.10 million jobs George H.W. Bush, 1989-93 First term: +2.59 million jobs Bill Clinton, 1993-2001 First term: +11.51 million jobs Second term: +11.24 million jobs Total: +22.74 million jobs George W. Bush, 2001-PRESENT First term: +7,000 jobs Second term to date: +4.42 million jobs Total to date: +4.43 million jobs * NOTE: The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics has monthly nonfarm payroll data under the current industrial classification system dating back to January 1939. Roosevelt's first two terms were calculated from annual nonfarm payroll data under a now-discontinued classification system. In addition, Roosevelt's first term began on March 4, 1933; Reuters prorated the 1933 annual jobs growth figure to account for the shorter term. Therefore, the jobs growth figures for Roosevelt's first two terms and the total figure under Roosevelt are not directly comparable to other data presented. Not all numbers will add up due to rounding.
