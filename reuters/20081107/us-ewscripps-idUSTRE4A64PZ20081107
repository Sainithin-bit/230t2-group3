 (Reuters) - Media company E.W. Scripps ( SSP.N ) swung to a third-quarter loss, suspended its dividend and said it will cut 400 jobs as the advertising market continued to deteriorate, sending its shares down to a more than 12-year low. 

 The owner of local newspapers and TV stations posted a net loss of $16.8 million, or 31 cents per share, compared with a profit of $88.4 million, or $1.63 per share, a year earlier. Revenue decreased 9 percent to $230 million. The latest third quarter included a $22 million charge to spin off the company's networks and interactive-media business, and a $25 million non-cash charge to further write down its investment in a Denver newspaper partnership. The company expects third-quarter revenue and expense trends to continue into the fourth quarter. E.W. Scripps has indicated that 2009 will be a challenging year, with uncertain economic conditions and weakness in advertising expected to continue into next year. The jobs cuts announced on Friday will result in annual payroll and benefits savings of about $15 million. Shares of EW Scripps fell to a low of $3.69, before recovering some losses to trade down 33 cents at $3.80 Friday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange. EW Scripps's results come a day after the Sun-Times Media Group Inc SUTM.OB also reported a third-quarter loss. The company, which publishes the Chicago Sun-Times daily paper, is a much smaller remnant of the one-time Hollinger International media empire. Like EW Scripps, Sun-Times Media has been cutting costs through job reductions, with its total headcount declining by 19 percent in the past 12 months. The company continues to explore strategic alternatives, which could include a sale or deregistration, Chief Executive Cyrus Freidheim said in a letter to shareholders on Thursday. Sun-Times posted a quarterly net loss of $2.04 a share, compared with $2.39 a share a year earlier. Operating revenue fell 15 percent to $78.8 million, while advertising revenue declined 18 percent.
