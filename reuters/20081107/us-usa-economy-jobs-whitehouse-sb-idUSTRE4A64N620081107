 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The programs being implemented by the Bush administration to address the financial crisis will promote economic growth and job creation, the White House said on Friday after a new report showed a big jump in unemployment. 

 "Today's employment numbers are a stark reminder of how critical it is we keep focused on utilizing the tools we now have to return our country to the strong job creation we had in recent years," said White House spokeswoman Dana Perino. "We know what the main problems are -- tight credit and housing markets -- and we have the tools to solve them," she said. "The programs we're putting in place will improve the flow of credit to consumers and businesses that will spur economic growth, job creation, and stabilization of our financial markets.
