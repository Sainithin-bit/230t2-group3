 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp posted a worse-than-expected $4.2 billion operating loss and burned through $6.9 billion in cash in the third quarter as the top U.S. automaker struggled with a deepening sales slump that has forced it to seek a federal bailout. 

 GM said it would cut white-collar jobs and cut $2.5 billion in capital spending next year as part of a revised restructuring plan now aimed at freeing up $20 billion in liquidity through 2009. The struggling automaker posted a third-quarter net loss of $2.5 billion, or $4.45 per share, compared with a loss from continuing operations of $42.5 billion, or $75.12 per share, a year earlier. Revenue fell to $37.9 billion from $43.7 billion a year earlier. The grim results come as GM joins with Ford Motor Co, Chrysler LLC and the United Auto Workers union in pressing for a U.S. government rescue package that backers say is needed to keep the industry from collapse at a time when sales have plunged to 25-year lows. GM Chief Executive Rick Wagoner said while the U.S. government had taken an important step to stabilize the economy, more needed to be done to help the battered auto industry. "The U.S. government's actions to help stabilize the credit markets and eventually ease the credit crunch are an essential first step to the economy's and the auto industry's recovery but further strong action is required," he said in a statement.
