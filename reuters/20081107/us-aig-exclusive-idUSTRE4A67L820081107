 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The United States government is looking at buying several billion dollars of preferred shares from American International Group ( AIG.N ) and possibly acquiring billions more of bonds guaranteed by the insurer, a source familiar with the matter said on Friday. 

 The options are being discussed as AIG and the government try to restructure the insurer's emergency loans, which saved AIG from bankruptcy but burdened the struggling insurer with a high interest rate. Talks to restructure the credit facility are expected to lead to improvement in the terms, the source said. Restructuring AIG's debt will give it more breathing room to sell assets over time to pay back the government. "Any easing of the terms that were struck in the original deal would be a plus," said Donald Light, an analyst at Celent LLC in San Francisco. The talks are at a sensitive stage and nothing definitive has been determined, the source cautioned. But an announcement could come as soon as this weekend or on Monday, when AIG is due to report quarterly results. The government gave AIG, once the world's largest insurer by market value, $85 billion in bailout financing in September after counterparties and rating downgrades forced it to post large amounts of collateral for credit derivatives positions. The government later offered additional financing to bring the total support to AIG to $123 billion. The initial credit line has a two-year term and an onerous interest rate, currently above 10 percent. AIG also granted the government warrants for a nearly 80 percent stake. AIG and the government are considering options including reducing the interest rate and increasing the term of the existing loan to five years, the source said. An equity injection through preferred shares may come with a reduction in the size of the $85 billion facility, the source said. The talks with the government also include the possibility of setting up vehicles to reduce the cash drain on AIG associated with credit default swaps and securities lending, the source said. One possibility being discussed is a plan to set up a facility where the government would buy some of the bonds that underlie credit default swaps, a type of insurance contract providing the buyer with protection against risk. Such a facility would be offset by the cash collateral of about $30 billion that AIG has posted to back those CDS and that the government can expect to get back, the source said. The size of such a facility is under discussion and could change substantially, but in talks earlier this week it was seen to be in the $60 billion to $70 billion range, the source said. "This is really just the portion of the credit default swap book that has caused like 90 percent of the writedowns," the source said. "They will only take out the bad stuff." ANOTHER VEHICLE Under another vehicle being considered, the government would buy residential mortgage-backed securities from AIG's securities lending portfolio, the source said. The size of the facility is unclear as well and the final figure could again change substantially, but in talks earlier this week the size being considered was $20 billion to $25 billion, the source said. Such a facility would wipe out the one for $37.8 billion created in October, the source said. As of November 5, the insurer owed $81.2 billion -- $61.3 billion under the $85 billion credit facility, and $19.9 billion under the $37.8 billion securities lending agreement. AIG spokesman Joe Norton said: "AIG continues to work on its plan to find a permanent solution to its liquidity losses, sell assets so it can repay the Federal Reserve Loan with interest, and explore other avenues to help AIG restore its financial health." On October 3, the insurer said it planned to keep its U.S. property-casualty, foreign general insurance businesses and an ownership interest in its foreign life operations but sell the remainder. It is expected to reach deals to sell its U.S. personal lines unit and an equipment insurer by the year end, a source told Reuters on Thursday. The insurer rescheduled its results announcement to early Monday. It is widely expected to post its fourth consecutive quarterly loss, hurt once more by writedowns on credit derivatives linked to subprime mortgages.
