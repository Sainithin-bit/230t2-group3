 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Windstream Corp WIN.N, which provides telecommunications services in rural U.S. areas, posted a 10 percent drop in quarterly profit and a revenue decline on Friday as it lost more traditional phone customers. 

 Third-quarter net income fell to $105.9 million, or 24 cents a share, from $117.7 million, or 25 cents a share, in the same quarter a year ago. Excluding items, Windstream earned 25 cents a share, a penny short of Wall Street expectations, according to Reuters Estimates. The company also reported an accounting charge of $6.5 million to adjust the value of its wireless spectrum holdings in North Carolina. Revenue fell 3 percent to $794.1 million, below the average analyst expectation of $802 million. Windstream said it received approval from the Federal Communications Commission to sell its North Carolina wireless properties to AT&T Inc ( T.N ) for $60 million in cash. Windstream's shares have lost about 40 percent in the past year as more people sign up for mobile phone service and abandon traditional land line accounts. The pace of Internet access customers also has slowed. Windstream had 3.08 million access lines at the end of the quarter, down 4.8 percent from last year. The company added more than 28,000 new high-speed Internet customers during the quarter, bringing its customer base to about 963,000, up almost 16 percent compared with last year. Windstream said it added 21,000 digital television customers during the quarter for a total customer base of about 252,000. (Reporting by  Robert MacMillan ; editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)
