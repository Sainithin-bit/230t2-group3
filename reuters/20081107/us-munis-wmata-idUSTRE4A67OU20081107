 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The transit agency for the Washington D.C. area sent a letter Friday to the U.S. Treasury Department asking for help with a soured leasing deal that could force the agency to pay millions in penalties. 

 Belgian KBC Bank ( KBC.BR ) held a "lease-back" contract with the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Agency (WMATA) that was guaranteed by insurance company American International Group ( AIG.N ). But when the insurer's ratings were downgraded the contract was considered in default, allowing KBC to collect a penalty payment of $40 million, which it has agreed to refrain from doing until next week. Recently, the United States has become a stakeholder in AIG in an effort to shore up the troubled company. "The best solution would be for the Treasury Department to guarantee AIG, thereby elevating AIG's rating and eliminating the technical default," wrote the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority's Christopher Zimmerman to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson. "Guaranteeing the payments would carry no practical risk or cost," he also wrote, adding that the agency has not missed a lease payment. Under lease-back agreements, municipalities sold their properties to bank or insurance companies and then leased them back, which netted the companies depreciation tax breaks. The U.S. District Court of Washington will hear WMATA's request for a preliminary injunction on November 12, and KBC has said it will not press for the penalty until then. Members of the U.S. Congress have also contacted the Treasury Department, but it has not issued a decision on helping WMATA or many of the other transit agencies that also have similar deals guaranteed by AIG.
