 SEOUL  (Reuters) - South Korea's central bank cut interest rates on Friday for the third time in a month, joining a global wave of monetary easing aimed at shoring up the world economy and calming panicked financial markets. 

 But the relatively small quarter percentage point cut in the country's benchmark interest rate disappointed some investors, who had hoped for a larger reduction due to rekindled market upheaval around the world on worry about a global recession. A media official at the Bank of Korea announced its decision to reduce the base rate to 4.00 percent, the lowest seen since early June 2006. Governor Lee Seong-tae is due to explain in detail at a news conference due from 9:20 p.m. EST. Analysts said the cut disappointed some who had expected up to 50 basis points off the key rate, but added the central bank would remain ready to take further action. "The central bank may have missed a good chance to cut it deeply," said Park Jong-youn, a fixed-income analyst at Woori Investment & Securities. "With major countries slashing their rates very deeply and rapidly, we should do it in the same way to maximise the effect. It's not time to save the bullets. The faster and deeper the rate cuts, the better for the economy." December treasury bond futures more than wiped out early gains of as much as 34 ticks to turn down 3 ticks on the day to 109.44 as of 8:51 p.m. EST. Won and stock market showed a generally muted reaction to the expected decision. The move follows a 100 basis point (bp) cut in two stages by the Bank of Korea in October, including a record 75 bp reduction at an emergency meeting last week, to join the global efforts to halt the financial crisis. It also comes after the European Central Bank and the Bank of England cut rates by 50 bp and 150 bp respectively on Thursday, part of a wave of reductions from central banks in the past week or so, including those in the United States, China and Japan. Nine of 14 analysts in a Reuters poll had predicted a 25 basis-point cut, four had forecast a 50 basis-point cut and one had expected no change. The government proposed an $11 billion economic stimulus package earlier this week, its latest move to shore up an economy that is losing steam rapidly.
