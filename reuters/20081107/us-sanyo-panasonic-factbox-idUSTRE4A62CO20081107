 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Panasonic Corp said it aims to make Sanyo Electric Co Ltd its subsidiary, creating Japan's largest electronics maker. 

 Following are some key facts about the two companies: * PANASONIC CORP: Panasonic is one of the largest electronics manufacturers in the world and comprises over 556 companies. It makes and markets over 15,000 products under the Panasonic brand. KEY FIGURES (12 months to March 31, 2008): Sales - 9.07 trillion yen ($92.82 billion) Pre-tax Profit - 435 billion yen Total Assets - 7.44 trillion yen Cash & Equivalents - 1.21 trillion yen Employees - 305,828 HISTORY - Founded as Matsushita Electric Devices Manufacturing Co by Konosuke Matsushita in 1918. Incorporated in 1935. - Starting out with two new products -- an attachment plug and a two-way socket -- the company soon became famous for new products such as a bullet-shaped bicycle lamp.
