 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson is considering "all options" regarding implementation of the $700 billion financial rescue plan, including areas of the financial sector beyond traditional banks, a senior Treasury official said on Friday. 

 "Treasury Secretary (Henry) Paulson has said he's looking at all options to accomplish his goals for the program," Assistant Secretary for Economic Policy Phillip Swagel told a news briefing. Swagel said the initial portion of a $250 billion capital injection plan focused on banks because of the economic leverage that could be gained from those institutions increasing their lending. But the financial sector is large, and the Treasury was also looking at other areas that provide funding to the economy. "We're just trying to balance all of the possible uses of TARP funds," he said, referring to the rescue plan's formal name, the Troubled Asset Relief Program. Sources familiar with Treasury's thinking said earlier this week that the department was considering extending capital injections to specialty finance firms such as General Electric's GE Capital unit or CIT Group Inc. Swagel said Friday's employment report showing job losses is evidence of difficult economic times, but noted that the Treasury was focused on implementing the financial rescue plan, which is helping to stabilize the financial markets. "We realize that moving from stability to growth will take some time," he said. (Reporting by  David Lawder , Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
