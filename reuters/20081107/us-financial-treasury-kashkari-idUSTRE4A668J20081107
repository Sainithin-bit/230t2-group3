 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Treasury's financial rescue program has brought some relief to credit markets but conditions remain vulnerable and more work needs to be done, a senior Treasury official said on Friday. 

 "Our markets remain fragile. Much work remains," Interim Assistant Secretary for Financial Stability Neel Kashkari said at a conference in New York. He also said the Treasury has not ruled out providing financial help to sectors other than the financial industry under the Troubled Asset Relief Program. Kashkari said he recognized the risk that the TARP would become a more permanent fixture of government under a future administration, but said his team hoped it would be temporary. He said provisions that restrict banks' ability to boost dividends or buy back shares gave Treasury some control over how the bailout funds are eventually spent. He urged patience with the disbursing of the funds, saying it was a slow process that required intricate planning and thorough coordination. "We continue to do a lot of work on the policy process," he said. Kashkari countered criticisms that the Treasury's program failed to adequately restrict executive compensation. "There are no golden parachutes above a certain level," he said. Kashkari also said it was difficult to blame mark-to-market accounting, where asset values are pegged to the current market price, for derailing the financial sector. "I haven't heard anyone come up with a better solution," he said. (Reporting by Pedro Nicolaci and  Kristina Cooke ; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
