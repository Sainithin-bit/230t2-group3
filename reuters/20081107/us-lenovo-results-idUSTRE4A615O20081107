 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - China's Lenovo Group Ltd ( 0992.HK ), the world' No. 4 PC maker, posted a 78 percent plunge in quarterly earnings on Friday on slower shipments and lower margins as the global financial crisis crimps appetite for technology products. 

 Corporate-focused Lenovo earned a net profit of $23.44 million in its fiscal quarter ended in September, compared with $105.26 million a year earlier. The result severely lagged an average forecast for $91.80 million, according to five analysts polled by Reuters Estimates. Analysts say China's top computer maker, which competes with Hewlett-Packard ( HPQ.N ), Dell Inc DELL.O and Asian rival Acer ( 2353.TW ), is expected to thrive in the long run due to its commanding share of China's market -- the world's top PC arena after the United States -- and other emerging markets. Shares in Lenovo plunged 36 percent between July and September, underperforming an 18.5 percent loss in Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index  .HSI , as investor's fled equities in the wake of the financial turmoil.
