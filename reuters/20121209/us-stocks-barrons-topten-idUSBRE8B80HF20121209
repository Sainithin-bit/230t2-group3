 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Corporate giants Apple ( AAPL.O ), JPMorgan Chase ( JPM.N ) and Royal Dutch Shell ( RDSa.L ) all made it into Barron's top 10 stock picks for 2013, the financial weekly reported on Sunday. 
 Barnes & Noble ( BKS.N ), BlackRock Inc ( BLK.N ), General Dynamics ( GD.N ), Marathon Petroleum ( MPC.N ), Novartis ( NOVN.VX ), Viacom ( VIAB.O ) and Western Digital ( WDC.O ) also made it onto the list as anticipated strong performers next year. Some of the year's picks, including Apple, BlackRock, Barnes & Noble and Viacom, already received bullish reviews in Barron's this year, while others were listed for their perceived undervaluation.
