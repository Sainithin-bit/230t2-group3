 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Australia's corporate regulator said on Monday it had refused an application by the group bidding for Qantas Airways Ltd. ( QAN.AX ) over its failure to reach 50 percent acceptances for its bid. 

 The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) said in a statement the bid group had sought to overcome its failure to reach 50 percent by a Friday deadline. "ASIC sees no reason to depart from long-established policies relevant to the application," ASIC said.
