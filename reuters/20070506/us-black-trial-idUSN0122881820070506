 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Much-anticipated testimony this week by David Radler, the ex-partner of former media baron Conrad Black, will likely make or break the criminal case against Black and three fellow executives, lawyers said. 

 The trial, which is entering its eighth week, will reach a crescendo when Radler, who was once operations chief at Hollinger International Inc., takes the witness stand some time on Monday and then faces what is sure to be withering cross-examination from each of the four defendants' lawyers. Federal prosecutors get first crack and will try to paint Radler, 64, as Black's co-conspirator in skimming $60 million from Hollinger as the two dismantled the Chicago-based company they had built into one of the world's largest newspaper publishers. Radler, a Canadian living in Vancouver, pleaded guilty nearly two years ago in exchange for a 29-month sentence and a promise to testify for prosecutors. Just before the trial began in March, Radler also agreed to pay $29 million to settle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and paid millions more to settle with Hollinger's successor company, the Sun-Times Media Group. The Canadian-born Black, 62, is charged with fraud, racketeering, money laundering and obstruction of justice. He faces up to 101 years in prison, millions in fines and $92 million in forfeitures if convicted. "Without Radler, they can't prove intent," said a lawyer involved in the case who requested anonymity. "Radler is going to have to be extremely specific about the conversations he had with the defendants and how they planned to get away with this," said Chicago attorney Hugh Totten, who has defended executives and is observing some of the trial in U.S. District Court. "There aren't any smoking gun documents," Totten said, noting prosecutors would have had to show the defense any such damning e-mails or recorded conversations before trial. Defense lawyers have said they intend to portray Radler, who was a key manager of Black's newspaper empire for more than 30 years, as the real culprit who is lying to save himself. PARSING DOCUMENTS Documents have been prominent in the trial that has occasionally been bogged down with repeated viewings and parsing of the dry language of financial statements, Totten said. Each side has appeared to score points with the jury, which has seemed attentive for the most part in a trial expected to continue through June. Testimony by newspaper executives, accountants, lawyers, and former Hollinger directors has been used to buttress the prosecution's accusation that Black and the other defendants disguised bonuses to themselves as non-taxed, non-compete payments. So-called non-compete fees ostensibly compensate executives or companies for agreeing not to reenter media markets that they exit. Prosecutors sought to show that the defendants claimed the  non-compete agreements were requested by the buyers of the newspapers when they were not, that some were never presented to Hollinger's board, and that the payments were left out or glossed over in financial statements or board resolutions. But on cross-examination, defense lawyers focused on bad advice from Hollinger's Canadian lawyers that the payments did not need to be disclosed. Representatives of Hollinger's outside auditors, KPMG, and independent directors that included luminaries Richard Burt, a former U.S. diplomat, Marie-Josee Kravis, an economist and Manhattan socialite, and James Thompson, a former Illinois governor, were similarly embarrassed by admissions that seemed to reveal lax oversight. "For the directors or senior management that signed off on this unwittingly, there's a challenge in why didn't they do a better job," Houston trial attorney Paul Francis observed. "These people were pilloried," Totten said. "Kravis was sliced and diced and Thompson was all but humiliated for his skimming" of important company filings. But the defense might have hurt itself if the jury is persuaded that incomplete disclosures of the payments by executives implied a cover-up, Totten said. Evidence of another crime Black is accused of -- that he used Hollinger's jet on a jaunt to the South Seas island of Bora Bora -- appeared ambiguous. Black's attorney showed that Black worked constantly, the company had no formal policy on the jet's use, and Black may have been overcharged by having to pay tax on the inflated $500,000 cost of the flight.
