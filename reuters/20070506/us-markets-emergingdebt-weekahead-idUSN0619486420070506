 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Emerging sovereign debt prices are likely to zigzag this week in an over-extended market as U.S. economic data and the Federal Reserve policy committee meeting are not set to renew any rally. 

 "The market looks overextended, exhausted, and we are still slowly grinding lower, and that is not going change very much. I don't think that the pending data or the Fed can really make an impact to renew a rally-type sentiment," said Enrique Alvarez, head of Latin America debt strategy at IDEAglobal. Investors will eye the Fed's meeting next Wednesday for clues on the direction of future interest rates and inflation risks. The U.S. central bank has raised short-term interest rates 17 times since mid-2004, lifting its fed funds rate to 5.25 percent, to keep the economic expansion going without allowing inflation to rise. "There's not much that the Fed is going to offer the market," Alvarez said. "Investors are convinced that the Fed is not going to move rates as it has very little to go on to make any type of insinuations that may move rates lower further out in the year; which is the preferred course of action that most people are expecting. They are going to be stuck at neutral." Exactly this type of scenario is ideal for emerging markets: a moderate slowdown of the U.S. economy that does not hurt demand for exports from developing economies but which allows U.S. interest rates to remain stable. Bond prices are close to all-time highs while yield spreads are near all-time lows amid strong flows into emerging markets as appetite for high-yielding assets rise, so investors could look to take some more profits this week. Inflows into dedicated emerging bond funds totaled $166.2 million during the week ending on May 2, according to EPFR Global. Brazil's global bond due 2040, considered the emerging market benchmark paper due to its high liquidity, was bid on Friday at 135.625 in price and yielded 5.565 percent. Investors will also eye U.S. retail sales as this data will likely show the speed with which the U.S. consumer continues to act and how that correlates to future economic growth, which in turn could affect Latin American markets. Import prices and producer prices are also on investors' agendas. Overall yield spreads between emerging market bonds and U.S. Treasury notes, an important gauge of investors' aversion to risk, was 166 basis points above U.S. Treasuries on Friday, according to JP Morgan's Emerging Markets Bond Index Plus (EMBI+) 11EMJ.JPMEMBIPLUS, nine basis points wider from its all-time low.
