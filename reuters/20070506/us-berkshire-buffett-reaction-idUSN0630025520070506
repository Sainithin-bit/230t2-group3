 OMAHA, Nebraska  (Reuters) - His voice was hoarse. Most of his message was the same. Some jokes were retreads. 

 If you're among the 27,000 people who on Saturday attended Berkshire Hathaway Inc.'s ( BRKa.N ) ( BRKb.N ) annual meeting here, you may not mind when the speaker is Warren Buffett. Attendance has grown from 7,500 just a decade ago, as the 76-year-old Buffett burnished his reputation for integrity and continued to build Berkshire into a $169 billion conglomerate. Berkshire owns 50-plus companies offering such things as car insurance, Ginsu knives, ice cream, paint and underwear, and invests in well-known companies such as Coca-Cola Co. ( KO.N ) and Procter & Gamble Co. ( PG.N ). At the meeting, Buffett and top lieutenant Charlie Munger, 83, snacked on Coke products, fudge and peanut brittle as they fielded hours of questions on such matters as Berkshire, the economy, Corporate America, private equity and even abortion. Buffett again termed the slow-speaking Munger "hyperkinetic," and joked that the two needed each other because "he can hear, I can see." "We enjoy Uncle Warren and Grandpa Charlie," said Jerry Jones of Omaha, a retired vice president of a travel agency. "That's the way most Omahans look at him. He's such a down-to-earth person. He talks about value investing, and walks the talk." Szabi Gyongyosi, a Hungarian native who is an investment manager in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, attended his third meeting -- "I knew what I was getting," he said -- and his wife accompanied him for the first time. He was intrigued when Buffett, who has unwound most of a $21 billion bet against the U.S. dollar, said Berkshire is betting on one currency, and that "it will surprise you what it is. We'll tell you about it next year." "He's been saying for a long time he expected the dollar to go down. That wouldn't be news," Gyongyosi said. "On the other hand, the yen has been very weak recently. Maybe he's thinking the yen is going to strengthen. Or something about the Chinese currency. It made me think, what is this secret trade?" A HAPPENING While parts of the weekend are a media circus, Marcia Schwiebert, a schoolteacher from Omaha who attended her fifth meeting, said Buffett's understated nature adds to his appeal. That even extends to the house he's lived in for half a century, and which is valued at just $710,000, according to the Douglas County Assessor. "Oh my word, Warren Buffett is like a god in town," she Schwiebert said. "Everybody listens to his advice. Also, it's a social function. Omaha is a small, little, I don't want to say cow town, but it's a very laid-back, simple little town. But this is a happening. This is something that happens. Along with the College World Series, Berkshire's meeting is the biggest annual event in Omaha, a city of 415,000. "He's done a lot of good anonymously," Schwiebert said. "I was talking to my neighbor, and she said he's given all this money to the underprivileged children's hospital, and no one knew about it. But she knew about it because she worked in the system." John Hoekstra, a Union Pier, Michigan resident and former ABN AMRO commodities trader, attended his first meeting. Like many shareholders, he's eyeing Buffett's succession plans. "I just wanted to see Warren, especially since he's getting up in years," he said. "The way he's talking about splitting his role into two jobs, figuring it's too much for one person now that the company is this big, I think he's on the right track. Whether it succeeds or not, time will tell."
