 LONDON  (Reuters) - Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ) and its partners continued talks about their possible takeover of Dutch bank ABN AMRO AAH.AS late on Sunday, sources familiar with the matter said on Sunday, as a key deadline neared for offers for the sale of ABN's U.S. arm LaSalle Bank. 

 The RBS-led consortium has made an indicative offer worth $24.5 billion for LaSalle, but the proposal is conditional on them also buying the rest of ABN, sources told Reuters on Saturday. The consortium also proposes an offer of about 39 euros per share, including a 60 euro cent dividend, for all of ABN, the sources said. If agreed, this would be the world's largest bank takeover valued at about 72 billion euros ($97 billion). ABN had previously agreed to sell LaSalle to Bank of America ( BAC.N ) for $21 billion, but higher offers can be made under a "go shop" clause that runs until midnight on Sunday in New York, or 0400 GMT on Monday. At the same time as ABN announced its sale of LaSalle, the Dutch bank announced it had agreed to be taken over by Britain's Barclays ( BARC.L ) in an all-share deal worth about 66 billion euros. RBS, ABN and Barclays either declined comment or could not be reached. The rival consortium -- which also includes Santander ( SAN.MC ) and Fortis FOR.BR - would trump both Bank of America's and Barclays' offers, but its proposals are conditional on a number of issues and their financing would not be finalized until later in the year, sources said. The consortium's offer for ABN is also conditional on the group not being exposed to any litigation related to the sale of LaSalle, the sources said. Bank of America on Friday sued ABN, seeking damages and a court injunction to block the sale of LaSalle to a rival bidder. The members of the consortium began talks with ABN on Friday, and discussions were still continuing on details late on Sunday, sources said.
