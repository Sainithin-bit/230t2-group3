 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Australia's Qantas Airways Ltd. ( QAN.AX ) said it had accepted that an A$11 billion ($9 billion) buyout bid by Airline Partners Australia (APA) for the airline had failed. 

 "While APA has made several regulatory applications over the weekend, the Qantas board considers that the current bid has failed," the airline said in a statement late Sunday. "Accordingly, Qantas will proceed with strategies and plans for its future." Qantas shares are expected to fall on Monday after Australia's Takeover Panel rejected an application by the bid group to include late support from a major shareholder who missed a deadline for acceptances. The bid group, which includes Macquarie Bank Ltd. MBL.AX and private equity firm Texas Pacific Group TPG.UL, said it would appeal the decision. Analysts said the offer was effectively dead and the role of senior Qantas management who supported the deal, particularly Chairman Margaret Jackson, was also in doubt. "It is hard to see her staying and her position is untenable," Shaw Stockbroking analyst Brent Mitchell told Reuters. APA failed to reach the 50 percent of shareholder acceptances it needed to trigger a two-week extension of the offer by a Friday deadline. But APA said on Saturday a late acceptance from a major U.S. investor hours after the deadline had pushed the acceptances to 50.6 percent and asked the Takeovers Panel to review the case. The panel said Sunday it had rejected APA's application. The sale of the national icon, dubbed the Flying Kangaroo, has faced political and strong union opposition, but was backed by the Australian government as well as Qantas management. However, some key shareholders attacked the A$5.45 per share offer as too low, forcing APA to reduce the level of shareholder acceptances needed for the deal to 70 percent from 90 percent. Qantas shares closed at A$5.38 on Friday. The bid group also includes Allco Equity Partners AEQ.AX, Allco Finance Group AFG.AX and Canadian investment firm Onex Corp ( OCX.TO ).
