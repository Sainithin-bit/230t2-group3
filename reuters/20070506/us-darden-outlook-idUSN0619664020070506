 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Darden Restaurants Inc. ( DRI.N ) said it has closed 56 of its Smokey Bones Barbeque & Grill restaurants and is offering the remaining 73 restaurants for sale, as part of an effort to better position Darden for future growth. 

 The Orlando, Florida-based restaurant operator will incur a pretax charge of about $260 million in the fourth quarter in connection with this action, the company said in a statement on Saturday. Darden expects earnings from continuing operations of $2.48 to $2.52 per share in fiscal 2007, above a prior forecast of $2.38 to $2.42 per share. Analysts, on average, have forecast earnings of $2.40 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. However, the company said due to actions related to the Smokey Bones restaurants it now expects a loss of $1.16 to $1.21 per share, from discontinued operations in 2007. The 56 Smokey Bones restaurants closed as of Friday night and the company will continue to operate the remaining 73 until they are sold, said a spokesman for Darden. Darden said it will give 4,000 employees who worked at closed Smokey Bones restaurants opportunities to transfer to other Darden locations like Olive Garden and Red Lobster.
