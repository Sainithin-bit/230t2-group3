 LONDON  (Reuters) - The European Central Bank issued a new statement on behalf of Vice President Vitor Constancio on Friday, altering his earlier comments on a Greek rescue plan. 

 Earlier, Constancio said that during his news conference on Thursday, ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet had only ruled out mechanisms that would create a credit event. "The president excluded many things yesterday but he did not say that he had excluded extensions of maturities. What he did say is that he excluded a scheme that could lead to a credit event or selective default," Constancio said. The ECB later said Constancio was replacing his earlier statement. The new one read: "President Trichet made clear that the ECB's Governing Council excludes all concepts that are not purely voluntary or have any element of compulsion, that entail any credit event or that entail any default or selective default. The ECB said Constancio also recalled that Trichet stated: "Whatever happens, it is not the ECB's decision but the responsibility of the governments. The ECB will apply its rules and framework as regards the soundness of counterparties for monetary policy operations and the quality of the collateral accepted in such operations."
