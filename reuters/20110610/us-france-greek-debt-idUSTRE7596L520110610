 LONDON  (Reuters) - French banks have agreed in principle to a rollover of Greek debt on condition that all creditors do the same, Britain's Financial Times reported on its website Friday. 

 The FT, citing unnamed people with knowledge of the negotiations, said the banks had agreed to subscribe to new issues of Greek sovereign debt to replace maturing bonds. The paper said the move could provide a way to involve private creditors in a Greek rescue package although it fell short of German demands for them to agree voluntarily to an extension of bond maturities. Thursday, sources familiar with the French government's thinking told Reuters that France could back a private sector rollover of the debt as part of a new EU-IMF bailout, dependent on whether a voluntary formula could be found to avoid wider damage in euro zone markets. Germany has demanded that private investors contribute to a second bailout for Greece. Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble urged parliament on Friday to back additional aid for Greece but said private creditor participation in a new package was "unavoidable" and said he favored a bond swap that would push out Greek debt maturities by seven years.
