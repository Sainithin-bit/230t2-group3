 LISBON  (Reuters) - French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde said she has no concerns about a judicial inquiry hanging over her candidacy to head the International Monetary Fund. 

 "I reaffirm as I did when I put my candidacy and threw my hat in the ring, that there is absolutely no ground to that inquiry," she told reporters in Lisbon. "I feel extremely confident and relaxed about it." A French court put off earlier on Friday until July 8 a decision on whether to open a formal inquiry into claims by opposition lawmakers that Lagarde abused her authority in approving a 285 million euro payout to a businessman friend of President Nicolas Sarkozy. Lagarde -- the front-runner for the IMF post and one of only two declared nominees as the window draws to a close on Friday -- also said she was a candidate representing all fund members.
