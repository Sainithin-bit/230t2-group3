 (Reuters) - Diageo, the world's largest spirits group, is close to a settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to end a long-running bribery investigation, the Financial Times reported. 

 The settlement talks are at an advanced stage and the British maker of Smirnoff vodka, Captain Morgan rum and Guinness beer has agreed to pay between $10 million and $20 million, the paper reported citing people familiar with the matter. The U.S. Department of Justice is not part of the settlement, the financial daily said. Diageo was not immediately available for comment and the SEC has declined comment.
