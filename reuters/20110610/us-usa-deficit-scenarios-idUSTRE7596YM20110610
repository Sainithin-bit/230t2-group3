 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The United States is grappling with a budget deficit set to top $1 trillion this year, but economists are confident that it won't get worse and is likely to start narrowing. 

 Despite a recent slowing of the U.S. economy, which means less tax revenues, and deadlocked budget talks in Congress, economists are not raising their forecasts for the shortfall. That is largely because stronger-than-expected economic growth at the end of 2010 gave a boost to tax revenues at the start of this year. If the recovery returns to something like its expected pace in the coming months, as many economists expect, the deficit could close the fiscal year ending September 2011 below the official forecast of $1.4 trillion. Below are two scenarios for how the U.S. fiscal situation might evolve in the remainder of 2011 and in 2012, plus an estimate of what very slow growth might mean for the deficit this year and next. GROWTH RECOVERS: DEFICIT EDGES DOWN Most likely scenario 2011 GDP 3.0 pct $1.2 trillion deficit 2012 GDP 3.5 pct $900 billion deficit The most likely scenario remains for the deficit to fall below official projections in 2011 and 2012, and even if the slowdown in growth proves more protracted than expected, the deficit should do no worse than stabilize near current levels. Tax revenues in April and May were helped by a pickup in the economic recovery at the end of 2010 and some of the U.S. government's fiscal stimulus measures are starting to expire. Current trends suggest the deficit in the fiscal year 2011 will come in closer to $1.2 trillion. That improvement, plus expectations among many economists that the slowdown in U.S. growth in recent months will be short-lived, mean the deficit for the fiscal year ending September 2012 is likely to come in below some of the most pessimistic forecasts, too, and could come in below $900 billion. GROWTH STAYS SLUGGISH: 2012 DEFICIT STABILIZES 2011 GDP 2.0 pct $1.22 trillion deficit 2012 GDP 2.0 pct $1.1 trillion deficit If the U.S. economy stays stuck at its current growth rate of around 2 percent, the budget deficit is likely to come in close to the Congressional Budget Office's projection of $1.1 trillion in 2012, assuming there are no policy changes. If there is no significant employment growth by the end of 2011, pressure to extend the 2011 payroll tax holiday for another year will grow. That could add close to $100 billion to the 2012 deficit although Republicans are likely to push hard for offsetting spending cuts. It seems likely some further cuts in spending will be forced by the Republicans as the price for an increase in the debt limit, and while lower spending will restrain growth in the short term, the spending reductions will outweigh the revenue losses in the deficit arithmetic -- meaning a net reduction in the deficit. If growth stays near 2.0 percent, unemployment may fail to fall from its current 9.1 percent level, though total spending on unemployment benefits may decline if lawmakers no longer extend benefits to the longer-term jobless. If there is no deal to increase the debt limit, any further revenue losses from an economic slowdown would have to be met with spending cuts to prevent an increase in the deficit. GROWTH SLUMPS: DEFICIT STAYS HIGH 2011 1 pct GDP $1.25 trillion deficit 2012 1 pct GDP $1.25 trillion deficit -- Please note that the GDP forecasts are for the year ending in December, but the budget forecasts are for the fiscal year ending in September.
