 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Friday it expects operating profit this business year to fall 35 percent to 300 billion yen ($3.7 billion) after Japan's biggest earthquake on record severely disrupted car production and slashed sales. 

 KEY POINTS: -- Toyota's operating profit forecast is far below the consensus of 434 billion yen in a survey of 23 analysts by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. -- Toyota incorporated a 100 billion yen negative impact from foreign exchange rates into its operating profit forecast. -- The company is assuming an average dollar/yen exchange rate of 82 yen this financial year. -- It forecasts sales to slip to 7.24 million vehicles from 7.3 million units the previous year. COMMENTARY: YOSHIHIKO TABEI, CHIEF ANALYST AT KAZAKA SECURITIES, TOKYO "The forecast is lower than market expectations and may be the result of incentives or leasing, but nonetheless it isn't really negative because (the outlook) makes clear a lot that was uncertain and that should bolster the shares. "Production of parts and vehicles is recovering and if there is an upswing in global demand, the company will probably beat its forecast." KAZUYUKI MURAI, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, PLAZA ASSET MANAGEMENT, TOKYO "Based on what the company has been saying, this is just what was expected. Toyota always makes conservative estimates. But it has its own problems (after the recall crisis). "I expect Toyota shares to recover only in line with the overall market. Toyota is in a period of restructuring its production structure after years of expansion. It is still not equipped with the ability to deal with rising demand in emerging markets. It's not that I'm worried about their future. But I think Toyota will be in for a sluggish period." KOICHI OGAWA, CHIEF PORTFOLIO MANAGER, DAIWA SB INVESTMENTS, TOKYO "This is probably another conservative estimate from Toyota, but it's predicting a loss in the fiscal first half so we can tell how serious the damage from the earthquake was. "Toyota shares have been rising recently so the stock may fall on Monday as investors react to the forecast, even though they know it's a conservative figure." MAKOTO KIKUCHI, CEO OF MYOJO ASSET MANAGEMENT, TOKYO "Toyota's announcement offered little surprise since that (300 billion yen in operating profit) somewhat falls in the lower end of the range sell-side analysts had been expecting." PARK SANG-WON, ANALYST, EUGENE INVESTMENT & SECURITIES, SEOUL "There is no change in Toyota's product competitiveness despite the earthquake. The quake rather offered the opportunity for Toyota to review and fix its quality control system while idling its plants. "But structural weakness remains for Toyota, as it has a higher portion of domestic production than Honda and Nissan, which makes it vulnerable to the yen's strength." BACKGROUND: -- Toyota said last month that the March earthquake contributed to a 52 percent fall in profit during the January-March quarter, but it delayed unveiling its annual forecasts as it weighed impact of the disaster on consumption and its supply chain. -- The massive disruption to production will almost certainly mean Toyota will fall behind General Motors Co and possibly Volkswagen AG to rank third in global vehicle sales this year. -- Shares of Toyota have fallen 7.5 percent since the March earthquake, underperforming a 6.5 percent fall in the benchmark Nikkei. The stock ended up 0.9 percent at 3,300 yen before the company announced its forecast on Friday.
