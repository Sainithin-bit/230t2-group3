 BERLIN  (Reuters) - German members of parliament late on Thursday agreed a joint motion for a resolution demanding the fair participation of private creditors in future aid to Greece, several participants said. 

 The deputies from all three parties in Chancellor Angela Merkel's center-right coalition agreed to have a say in agreements for new aid packages, several of them said after parliamentary group meetings had finished. "The German parliament urges the government to only agree to new financial aid for Greece if an appropriate participation of private creditors has been introduced," the resolution said. "That way a fair burden sharing between public and private sides can be reached." The resolution also demands for renewed IMF participation for any new rescue package and demands Greece to secure a noticeable part in its debt reduction through an "ambitious and short-term realizable privatization program." On Friday, the resolution will be put to a vote in parliament, where the ruling coalition has a majority of 19 votes. The resolution will become part of Germany's negotiating position, presented by Wolfgang Schaeuble at the meeting of finance ministers on June 20 and later by Chancellor Angela Merkel at the EU summit on June 24. It is non-binding. Late on Thursday at the parliamentary group meetings, there were eight votes against the resolution and four abstentions among the conservative parliamentary group. The Free Democrats faction also voted in favor of the resolution with one dissenting and one abstention vote. Both groups fiercely debated risks and opportunities of a new aid package for Greece and Peter Altmaier, who leads Merkel's conservative parliamentary group, said no one in the conservative group was in favor of a hard restructuring. Free Democrat parliamentarian Frank Schaeffler was, according to participants, against a new aid package for Greece -- though 91 deputies voted in favor of it. Schaeffler is one of the loudest dissenting voices against Greek aid in the FDP. Rainer Bruederle, FDP parliamentary floor leader, said his party strongly supported the joined resolution, the long debate was worth it. FDP party leader Philipp Roesler added: "The FDP stands clearly for a strong euro." Meanwhile, the leader of Germany's Social Democrat opposition, Sigmar Gabriel, emphasised his call for a hard restructuring of Greek debt and an extensive participation of private creditors after a meeting of his parliamentary group "I don't think that there is a way around a proper restructuring with a clear creditor contribution, in fact at a larger degree than through an extension of credit maturities," Gabriel said. How to involve the private sector is hotly contested within the single currency bloc. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble in a letter earlier this week proposed a swap in which private debt holders would trade in their Greek government bonds for new ones, giving Greece an extra seven years to work through its debt. France on the other hand, was against any form of debt restructuring, but sources familiar with government thinking said on Thursday it could back a private sector rollover if a voluntary formula could be found to avoid wider damage markets.
