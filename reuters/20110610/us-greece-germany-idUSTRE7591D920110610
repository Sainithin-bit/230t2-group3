 BERLIN  (Reuters) - German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble urged parliament on Friday to back additional aid for Greece but said private creditor participation in a new package for the heavily indebted euro zone member was "unavoidable." 

 In a speech to the Bundestag two weeks before EU leaders are due to meet in Brussels to finalize a new rescue for Greece that officials say will total 120 billion euros, Schaeuble warned of disastrous consequences if aid was not forthcoming and the country was pushed into a disorderly default. But in prodding skeptical lawmakers to support more assistance, he also laid out strict German conditions for a deal, saying Greece must make far-reaching reforms and that banks that hold the country's bonds should share the pain. "If there are doubts about the ability of Greece to pay back its debt and we must win time with a new package, then the participation of the private sector in the solution is unavoidable," Schaeuble said. Schaeuble's stance puts Germany on a potential collision course with the European Central Bank, which said on Thursday it opposed any form of private creditor participation that was not "purely voluntary." "I proposed a swap of Greek bonds that would lead to a lengthening of the maturities by seven years while maintaining the existing interest rate conditions," Schaeuble said, in reference to a letter he sent to euro zone partners this week. "This would give Greece the necessary time to carry out reforms and win back confidence. It would limit the risks of a negative market reaction, establish fair burden-sharing between taxpayers and the private sector and send a clear signal to all that losses cannot be pushed onto taxpayers alone." Ratings agencies warned on Thursday it might be impossible to conduct such a swap on a voluntary basis. Schaeuble acknowledged the ECB was opposed to his ideas for involving private creditors, but said he and his euro zone colleagues had agreed to set up a working group that would work on a solution that avoided negative market consequences. He said the ECB, International Monetary Fund and European Commission would participate.
