 JOHANNESBURG  (Reuters) - South Africa's Trevor Manuel said on Friday it would be unfortunate if the next head of the International Monetary Fund was from Europe. 

 After announcing that he would not enter the race to head the Washington-based institution, Manuel told a news conference it would be "most unfortunate if we end up with a European who is bound by the EU." (Reporting by  Peroshni Govender , Editing by Ed Cropley)
