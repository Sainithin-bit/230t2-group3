 LISBON  (Reuters) - French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde said on Friday she was confident about a judicial review of her role in a 2008 arbitration payout. 

 "I am always confident," Lagarde told reporters in Lisbon, where she will attend the African Development Bank annual meeting. Three judges will meet on Friday to discuss whether the case brought against her by opposition deputies merits a formal probe, and a judicial source said they will likely seek extra time before deciding. Lagarde is the favorite to head the International Monetary Fund after her compatriot Dominique Strauss-Kahn quit the post last month to defend himself against a charge of attempted rape. The deadline for nominations falls today. (Reporting by  Carolyn Cohn , editing by Mike Peacock)
