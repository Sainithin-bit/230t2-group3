 WINNIPEG, Manitoba  (Reuters) - Cargill Inc CARG.UL said Friday it will close its grain elevator and crop input facility at Strathroy, Ontario as of July 1. 

 The U.S.-based agribusiness, which is also Canada's third-largest grain handler, said it will move its Strathroy business to its existing location in nearby Melbourne, Ontario, which is newer and able to handle greater storage. (Reporting by Rod Nickel; Editing by John Picinich)
