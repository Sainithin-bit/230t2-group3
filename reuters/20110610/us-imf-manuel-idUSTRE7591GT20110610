 JOHANNESBURG  (Reuters) - Former South African finance minister Trevor Manuel all but ruled himself out of the race to head the International Monetary Fund on Friday, saying his focus was on his own country. 

 "Today is the deadline. I haven't put my hat into the ring as I speak to you," he told public radio station SAFM. "My adrenaline is flowing about South Africa right now. It's where my focus is." "We've got to turn this country round," he added. (Reporting by  Peroshni Govender , Writing by Ed Cropley)
