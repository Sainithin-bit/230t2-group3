 WASHINGTON/NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A federal judge gave final approval to Citigroup Inc's ( C.N ) revised $75 million settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to resolve allegations that the bank misled investors about its subprime mortgage exposure. 

 U.S. District Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle had signaled last month that she would approve a revised accord, which imposes more stringent procedures for corporate governance and in how the third-largest U.S. bank by assets discloses quarterly results. Huvelle's approval, dated October 8, was made public on Tuesday in the docket of the federal court in Washington. The accord requires Citigroup to maintain a disclosure committee and an earnings committee for three years. It also requires several bank officials, including the chief executive and chief financial officer, to certify to the accuracy of earnings press releases and scripts accompanying analyst conference calls. The SEC had accused Citigroup of misleading investors by telling them from July to October 2007 that its exposure to subprime securities was just $13 billion, only to reveal that November that the sum was more than $52 billion. Soaring losses on subprime and other debt led to a series of federal bailouts for Citigroup. Huvelle in August refused to approve the original settlement, which also called for a $75 million payment. At a hearing last month, she said she wanted to "make sure that procedures are in place to address the problem that occurred." Citigroup spokeswoman Shannon Bell and SEC spokesman John Nester said they were pleased the settlement was approved. Nester said the accord "appropriately addresses the alleged wrongdoing and provides significant investor protections." The SEC also sued two executives, who agreed to pay $180,000 to resolve related administrative proceedings. None of the defendants admitted wrongdoing. Shares of Citigroup were down 0.5 percent at $4.15 in afternoon trading. The case is SEC v. Citigroup Inc, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia, No. 10-01277.
