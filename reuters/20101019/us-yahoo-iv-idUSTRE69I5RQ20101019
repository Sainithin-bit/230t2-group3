 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc's fourth-quarter revenue forecast disappointed Wall Street, as it continues to struggle to revitalize growth and stave off rivals like Google Inc. 

 Commentary: YUN KIM, ANALYST, GLEACHER & CO "Definitely there's weakness in the Americas, year over year declines there. That's probably the main concern of investors. That's where more companies are showing improvement, in the Americas region. "That was Yahoo's weakness last quarter. Why did they decline year over year while their peers showed improvement?" BRIAN PITZ, ANALYST, UBS "A good part of the EPS beat was because of the sale of the Hotjobs business. The revenue was a little lighter than what we were looking for. EBITDA margins were slightly better. That was probably due to sales and marketing costs being slightly lower than we were anticipating as a percentage of revenue. The cost of sales were lower as well. "When you look at the guidance, it's a little light. This is more of a revenue story. The benchmark of success is going to be them re-accelerating the top line, so the revenue was a lot lighter than what the Street was looking for the fourth quarter. "It would make sense if they did something with AOL because the business is at the point where it's a game of scale. Having the largest amount of display advertising ... and ability to take out a large amount of costs, could be pretty compelling, but its easier said then done. There's a lot of politics involved and reasons why it wouldn't happen." COLIN GILLIS, ANALYST, BGC PARTNERS "It's the revenue growth, the revenue growth its still not there. It's 2 percent. And more troubling is that the display growth is starting to slow." SANDEEP AGGARWAL, ANALYST, CANTOR FITZGERALD "Basically modest miss top line, modest beat bottom line. It seems like display advertising is strong for them and they were able to impress us in terms of improving their margins, but top-line growth remains challenging." CLAY MORAN, ANALYST, THE BENCHMARK CO "The revenues were a little bit light and the guidance is also sort of uninspiring. The display business is up 17 percent, which is below expectation and, of course, the total revenues aren't growing. Not that surprising but certainly not inspiring or shows any noticeable change in operating trends." LOU KERNER, ANALYST, WEDBUSH SECURITIES "Given Google's recent report, and more broadly, the accelerating market place for Internet advertising, this is mildly disappointing. "It would have been great to see a beat. But given recent misses, at least performing in line is probably a win with Yahoo."
