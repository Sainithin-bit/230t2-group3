 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke made no comments on the economy or monetary policy in remarks on financial education prepared for delivery on Tuesday. 

 "Financial education helps young people cultivate a sense of financial responsibility," Bernanke said at the opening of the Junior Achievement Finance Park. "It is essential for their personal well-being, and for the effective functioning of our economy."
