 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - UnitedHealth Group Inc ( UNH.N ) on Tuesday provided a cautious view of its prospects next year, including likely lower profit, as it grapples with new healthcare reforms, overshadowing far better-than-expected third-quarter results. 

 The largest U.S. health insurer held back from providing a specific 2011 forecast because new rules governing spending on medical care have yet to be finalized. But UnitedHealth, considered an industry bellwether, said it expected "some level" of reduction in operating earnings and net earnings per share. After rising in premarket trading on the strong quarterly results, shares were down 2.6 percent in morning trading following comments by Chief Executive Officer Stephen Hemsley about next year. "Given this external environment and its uncertainties, ....our tone as we enter 2011 is appropriately measured," Hemsley told analysts on a conference call. While the projection for lower earnings was likely hurting the stock, those who follow the industry should not be surprised considering the new laws, CRT Capital analyst Sheryl Skolnick said. "Analysts and investors who are close to the story are not only not surprised by this, I think they're probably relieved that management isn't telling fairy tales," Skolnick said. "It's a very prudent statement of recognition of economic realities and regulatory uncertainties." The analyst also noted the weaker overall market on Tuesday could be weighing on the company's shares. The 2011 outlook took prominence for investors over the strong quarterly beat, which was driven by UnitedHealth's health plan members using fewer healthcare services. Third-quarter net income rose to $1.28 billion, or $1.14 per share, from $1.04 billion, or 89 cents per share, a year ago. Analysts on average were expecting 84 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. UnitedHealth's revenue rose 9 percent to $23.7 billion, ahead of the $23.3 billion estimate. The company also raised its 2010 profit outlook. AWAITING SPENDING RULES UnitedHealth and other insurers are awaiting final regulations that will govern how much the companies must spend starting next year on medical care as opposed to administrative expenses and profits. A key group of state insurance commissioners is expected to issue final recommendations this week on rules for the spending ratio, known as the medical loss ratio. For the quarter, the company spent 80.1 percent of its premium revenue on medical care, down from 82 percent a year ago. Wall Street often sees such declines in the medical loss ratio as a promising sign for profitability. But companies may have to give rebates if their ratios come in too low next year, erasing gains for the bottom line. UnitedHealth cited a lower use of healthcare services that also boosted industry results earlier this year. Consumers whose plans lead them to face higher out-of-pocket costs are delaying care, said Wedbush Securities analyst Sarah James. The decline in healthcare service costs also stems from lower expense from to the H1N1 flu compared with a year ago, James said. "It looks like a strong quarter, and the outperformance was driven by lower-than-expected medical expenses," James said. "A longer-term trend is from the continued lower hospital utilization, which is something that we've seen across the companies every quarter this year." Revenue in UnitedHealth's business serving Medicare and other plans for the elderly grew 11 percent to $8.8 billion, while its unit serving low-income Medicaid recipients rose 29 percent to $2.7 billion. Both units added significant amounts of enrollees. Its total membership stood at 32.7 million at the end of September, up about 2 percent. With the new law bringing more regulations over its core health benefits business, UnitedHealth has announced several recent acquisitions to boost its presence in health services, such as medical compliance or software for hospitals. Quarterly revenue in its Ingenix business providing healthcare information and other services rose 23 percent to $592 million. UnitedHealth forecast 2010 earnings in the range of $3.85 per share to $3.95 per share, up from its previous view of $3.40 to $3.60 per share. Analysts were projecting $3.60. UnitedHealth also raised its projection for full-year revenue to nearly $94 billion, up from about $93 billion before. UnitedHealth's shares fell 94 cents to $35.31 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Through Monday, UnitedHealth shares have risen about 19 percent this year, outperforming a 13 percent rise for the Morgan Stanley Healthcare Payor index .HMO of health insurers.
