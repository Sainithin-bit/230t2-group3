 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bank of New York Mellon ( BK.N ) reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by acquisitions that increased its assets under custody and management and the fees it can collect on them. 

 Third-quarter operating profit was $670 million, or 55 cents a share, up from $642 million, or 54 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts on average expected a profit of 54 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. BNY Mellon bought two companies during the quarter that charge fees for servicing client money. The acquisitions boosted its assets under custody and administration 10 percent from last year to $24.4 trillion. The acquisitions of PNC Financial's ( PNC.N ) Global Investment Servicing business and a German unit, BHF Asset Servicing, also bolstered BNY Mellon's fee revenue from securities servicing, the company said. Securities servicing fees increased 20 percent from a year ago to $1.5 billion, BNY Mellon said. BNY Mellon reported profit from continuing operations of $625 million, or 51 cents a share, up from a loss of $2.4 billion, or $2.04 a share, a year earlier. Revenue climbed 3 percent to $3.4 billion. Shares of BNY Mellon closed up 3 percent at $26.62 on Monday. (Reporting by Elinor Comlay. Editing by Lisa Von Ahn and  Robert MacMillan )
