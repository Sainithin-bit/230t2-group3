 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co ( KO.N ) reported higher-than-expected sales and earnings on Tuesday, helped by its second straight quarter of improved beverage sales in North America. 

 The world's largest soft-drink maker has made turning around the ailing North American market a top priority. It bought its largest bottler in the region, developed high-tech fountain machines that can dispense 100 different drinks, introduced smaller can sizes and improved its marketing. But that goal is far from complete as Coke integrates the North American operations of Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc ( CCE.N ), which it bought earlier this month. "This is not a victory lap. First stability, then growth," Coke Chief Executive Muhtar Kent said in an interview. The maker of Sprite, Fanta, Minute Maid and vitaminwater said volume in North America rose 2 percent in the third quarter. That follows a 2 percent rise in the second quarter, which was its first increase in more than two years. Coca-Cola does not give earnings forecasts and Kent declined to say whether the increases would last. "We feel our investments, our marketing, our brand health metrics are all in a good place," Kent said. "There is still a very challenging environment out there. With that, you will certainly see us outperform the industry." Coke's shares rose 0.7 percent to a 52-week high, while the wider stock market fell on concerns over China's move to raise interest rates. Shares of rival PepsiCo ( PEP.N ), which trimmed its full- year profit forecast earlier this month amid a tough consumer environment, fell 1.1 percent. Excluding benefits related to Pepsi's purchase of its own North American bottlers, its volume in the Americas was flat. The deals should give both companies more control and flexibility in selling their drinks. "Investors don't fully appreciate the sustainability of what Coke is doing," said Consumer Edge Research analyst Bill Pecoriello. "Coke will have to continue to do this quarter after quarter into 2011." Pecoriello said his 2011 earnings estimate is more than 10 cents per share above Wall Street's consensus. He is bullish about Coke's opportunities to cut costs and improve its business from the bottler acquisition. "If you couple a positive North America, which has been a drag on results for years, with very strong international growth, you have best-in-class (performance)," he said. Coke's third-quarter net income was $2.06 billion, or 88 cents per share, up from $1.90 billion, or 81 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, earnings were 92 cents per share, topping analysts' average estimate of 89 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 5 percent to $8.43 billion as worldwide volume rose 5 percent. Analysts had forecast revenue of $8.3 billion. STRENGTH AROUND THE WORLD Coke's results were helped by a 1 percentage point contribution from higher prices. Coke expects price and mix of goods to have a neutral impact for the full year. Coke said its efforts to integrate the bottler are well on track, and repeated its cost-savings target of at least $350 million per year, phased in over the next four years. It also expects to buy back about $2 billion in shares by the end of 2010. It plans to have its new Freestyle soda fountains in 15 markets by the end of the year. Kent declined to say what the ultimate potential of the soda fountains were, except that its current plan is "right on target." Coke said international volume rose 6 percent, fueled by growth of 12 percent in the Eurasia and Africa business, 11 percent in the  Pacific region and 4 percent in Latin America. Volume rose 30 percent in Russia, and the company cited the strength of its core soda brands such as Coca-Cola. Volume rose 11 percent in Japan, the biggest increase in more than a decade, as record-high temperatures spurred sales of soft drinks. The company also posted gains of 13 percent in Brazil and 19 percent in the Philippines. One soft spot was Mexico, where volume was flat, due in part to bad weather. Volume in Europe was slightly positive, but rounded to even, Coke said. In afternoon trading, Coke's shares were up about 30 cents, or 0.5 percent, at $60.30 on the New York Stock Exchange.
