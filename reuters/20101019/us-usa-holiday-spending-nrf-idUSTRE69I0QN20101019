 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Shoppers plan to part with more of their cash during the coming holiday season for the first time since a recession took hold three years ago, according to a retailing trade group's survey. 

 Consumers plan to spend an average of $688.87 on holiday shopping this year, an increase of 1 percent from 2009, according to the survey released overnight by the National Retail Federation. The survey was conducted by BIGresearch from October 5-12, and polled 8,767 people. The NRF has forecast total retail sales growth of 2.3 percent for the November-to-December period this year. Its survey of spending plans per capita shows consumers are slightly less concerned about high unemployment and a tepid economic recovery than a year ago. Some 61.7 percent said the economy will affect their spending, down from 65.3 percent a year earlier. In another sign of an improved consumer appetite, fewer shoppers said discounts would be a determining factor in their purchases. Just less than 41.8 percent said markdowns would be an important factor, down from 43.3 percent in 2009. In a sign that could cut into sales at lower-priced retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc, 65.1 percent said they would buy something at a discounter, down from 70.1 percent last year. A separate report from research firm ShopperTrak forecast that sales would rise 2.9 percent this holiday season as consumers continue hunting for bargains and visit stores less frequently. U.S. consumers have gone shopping less often in 2010, but they spent more per visit because shopping trips were planned around deals and promotions. ShopperTrak said it expects that trend to continue during November and December. According to the NRF, consumers are paying more attention to customer service, with 5.3 percent saying it would have an impact on their purchasing, up from 4.4 percent in 2009. The importance of product quality also rose for 12.7 percent of respondents, from 11.8 percent a year ago. Just more than 57 percent of people surveyed said they would use holiday sales to buy something for themselves, compared with 52.9 percent in 2009. This year, consumers plan to spend $393.55 on gifts for family, $71.45 on gifts for friends, $18.26 on co-workers and $34.82 for others. Total 2010 gift spending is expected to rise 2.1, with the remainder of money being used for decorations, greeting cards and postage, candy, food and flowers.
