 LONDON  (Reuters) - Miner Xstrata posted mixed third quarter production data on Tuesday and said financial performance was strong as metals prices remained healthy. 

 "Xstrata's operating and financial performance continues to be strong and the company's financial position remains robust," a statement said. The Anglo-Swiss group also released the first resource estimate for the West Wall copper project, a 50:50 joint venture with Anglo American, showing it contained 4 million metric tons of copper. "These latest successful exploration results confirm that the West Wall project represents an important discovery with the potential to contribute to Xstrata Copper's project development pipeline in Chile," a statement said. Copper is the group's most important product, accounting for 43 percent of first-half operating profit, while coal is second, making up 32 percent. Xstrata said production of mined copper increased 10 percent to 233,647 metric tons during the three months to the end of September due to improved mining rates and grades. Consolidated coal output fell 5 percent to 21.9 million metric tons following planned mine closures in Australia and South Africa and bad weather in Colombia. Xstrata more than doubled first-half earnings per share on higher metals prices when it reported in August, saying at the time it would pump over $5 billion into new mines. The trend of strong prices has largely continued through the third quarter, with copper prices up 24 percent compared with a year ago, Australian coking coal 53 percent higher and ferrochrome 46 percent stronger. Zinc in concentrate output fell by 10 percent due to lower production at the Brunswick and Mt. Isa mines. Mined nickel production jumped 21 percent to a record 16,174 metric tons due to output from its new Rim South mine. Ferrochrome output declined by 7 percent due to scheduled maintenance. Xstrata shares opened down 0.3 percent at 1301.5 pence, in line with the British mining index (Editing by Dan Lalor and David Cowell)
