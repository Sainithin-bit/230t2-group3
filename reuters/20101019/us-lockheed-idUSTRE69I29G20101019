 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Defense contractor Lockheed Martin Corp ( LMT.N ) posted a lower quarterly profit on Tuesday hurt by costs for executive buyouts, and said contract delays and pension expenses could weigh on 2011 results. 

 The maker of fighter jets cut its 2010 full-year forecast, citing the loss of projected sales from a unit it expects to sell this year. Lockheed, whose F-35 Joint Strike Fighter is the Pentagon's costliest weapons program, said net earnings fell 28 percent to $571 million, or $1.57 a diluted share, from $797 million, or $2.07 a share, a year earlier. Special items in the quarter included a 32 cents a share charge tied to executive buyouts that are expected to lower overhead costs. Analysts expected $1.53 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 6 percent to $11.38 billion, compared with $11.59 billion expected by analysts.
