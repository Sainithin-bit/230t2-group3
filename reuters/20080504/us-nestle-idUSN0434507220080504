 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Nestle SA ( NESN.VX ) shares look undervalued and could rise 20 percent over the next 12 months, weekly financial Barron's said on Sunday. 

 "Arguably, they're the strongest food company in the world," Eric Scher, a Sanford C. Bernstein analyst told Barron's. "Nobody else is growing at everything straight across the board like Nestle." Scher argues Nestle shares should be trading about 20 percent higher in a year. The report said that, at its recent price of about 490 Swiss francs, the stock was trading about 10 percent below its 52-week high and at a discount to most of its peers on several valuation measures. With names such as Butterfinger candy bars, Gerber baby foods, Stouffer's and LeanCuisine frozen meals, JuicyJuice beverages, Nestle has a global stable of blockbuster brands -- 29 of which have annual sales exceeding one billion Swiss francs each, the report said. One Swiss franc equals about 96 U.S. cents. (Reporting by  Jui Chakravorty ; Editing by  Andre Grenon )
