 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc will stay focused on evaluating strategic alternatives after Microsoft Corp walked away from a $44.6 billion takeover offer, a person familiar with the matter said on Saturday. 

 Yahoo is not looking for offers, the source said, but added that the board is open to considering options that maximize shareholder value. Yahoo has discussed tie-ups with both Time Warner Inc's AOL division and Google Inc, different sources earlier told Reuters. A partnership with Google, in which Yahoo search results would carry advertising from Google, may be announced as early a next week, another source told Reuters. (Reporting by  Anupreeta Das )
