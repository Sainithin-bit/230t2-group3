 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp Chief Executive Steve Ballmer told employees on Saturday he remains confident the software giant can achieve its goals without Yahoo Inc. 

 "Although the acquisition of Yahoo would have accelerated our ability to deliver on our strategy in advertising and online services, I remain confident that we can achieve our goals without Yahoo," Ballmer said in a letter to employees, obtained by Reuters. (Editing by  Todd Eastham )
