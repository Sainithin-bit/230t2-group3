 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp on Saturday ended a three-month public effort to buy Yahoo Inc. 

 Following is a timeline of key events in the corporate courtship, beginning with private talks held before the software company announced its offer for the Web pioneer. Late 2006/early 2007 - Microsoft and Yahoo discuss various partnerships, including a merger. February 2007 - Yahoo tells Microsoft it is not the right time to discuss a takeover as Yahoo board sees great potential from new advertising technology, internal changes. 2008 January 31 - Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer makes $44.6 billion, $31-per-share cash-and-stock takeover offer to Yahoo board. February 1 - Microsoft makes the offer public. Its shares fall 6.6 percent to $30.45; Yahoo shares rise 48 percent to $28.38. February 11 - Yahoo rejects Microsoft offer as too low. February 13 - MySpace owner News Corp and Yahoo discuss tie-up, according to a source. March 18 - Yahoo gives financial forecasts for next two years, in effort to prove it is worth more than Microsoft bid. April 4 - People familiar with the matter say Microsoft is evaluating its bid for Yahoo because the Internet company may have lost value since Microsoft first made its offer. April 5 - Microsoft sets three-week deadline for Yahoo to negotiate and reach a deal or face a proxy fight and possible cut to the bid. April 7 - Yahoo again rejects Microsoft and says it is open to a higher price. April 9 - Yahoo says it will test Google Inc search ads on its site, which could be more lucrative than selling its own search ads. Sources say Yahoo and Time Warner are in parallel talks to join Time Warner's AOL and Yahoo. April 26 - Microsoft deadline to Yahoo passes. April 30 - Ballmer flies to California for talks with Yahoo CEO Jerry Yang. May 3 - Yang meets Ballmer in Seattle. Microsoft raises offer to $33 per share, or $47.5 billion. That is about $5 billion over value of the previous offer at the time; Yahoo wants $37 per share, or about $5 billion more. Late in the day, Ballmer calls off the talks.
