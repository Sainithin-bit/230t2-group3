 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc. could make as much as $24 billion in writedowns and lay off 20,000 workers as part of a plan to cut costs and boost capital, CNBC said on its Website in a report dated Sunday. 

 The report said the plans will be unveiled on Tuesday, when it reports its fourth-quarter results. Citigroup is widely expected to report a quarterly loss and announce big lay-offs as it looks to cut costs in a tough business environment. Many analysts believe Citi will also look to suspend or cut its dividend in a bid to save $10 billion cash a year. (Reporting by  Ritsuko Ando , editing by Will Waterman)
