 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Italian luxury sports car brand Maserati might sell to the super-rich, but it is still worried about developments in the U.S. economy. 

 "The United States is our biggest market, and we are monitoring the situation very carefully, day by day," Chief Executive Roberto Ronchi told Reuters on Monday. "We are a small company, and I hope that we will not be hurt too much." Ronchi was at the North American International Auto Show to unveil a special series of Maserati's Quattroporte -- the Collezione Cento -- which has a smoother ride than the sporty Quattroporte GT. The series is aimed at business executives and could attract clients who drive a top-line Mercedes ( DAIGn.DE ). Only 100 Collezione Cento vehicles will be sold, with specifications tailored to client's tastes. The price, which starts at 140,000 euros, or $147,000, is at a euro/dollar exchange rate of almost one, even though it is $1.45 on the market. Ronchi aims to sell 8,500 to 9,000 cars in 2008, up from 7,353 in 2007, which was a 33.3 percent rise from the previous year. In the United States, the Fiat ( FIA.MI ) subsidiary aims to sell 3,200 cars, vs. 2,600 in 2007. VERY GOOD FEELING Ronchi declined to comment on 2007 results, which are due out on January 21, but said he had a very good feeling about them. Maserati was able to offset the dollar's fall against the euro, he added. In the first nine months of the year, Maserati had a profit of 6 million euros against a year-earlier loss 32 million euros. Sales rose 29.3 percent to 485 million euros. Ronchi said the luxury market was driven more by novelties than economic developments, and Maserati had a good take-up of its recently introduced automatic transmission gear box -- of which more than 5,000 cars had been sold. The United States makes up 36 percent to 40 percent of Maserati sales. The company derives 85 percent to 88 percent of sales from its top markets, which also include Japan, Italy, Germany, Britain, Australia, Switzerland and France. China is growing fast and will soon become the company's sixth-largest market, according to Ronchi. Maserati aims to sell cars in the 80,000-140,000 euro bracket, which positions it in price below Ferrari -- also of Fiat ( FIA.MI ) -- but above Porsche ( PSHG_p.DE ), he said. For Maserati to reach its annual unit sales target of 15,000 to 20,000 by 2014 -- a level at which it could fund its own research and development -- it needs what Ronchi called a "third pillar." Maserati has the GranTurismo and the Quattroporte and will decide in the first half of 2008 on a third model. "It will not be an SUV," Ronchi said. " ... The SUV market is starting to decline, the perception of SUVs is changing, and there are too many competitors already." He gave no indication of what the new car could be, but said it would be at the lower end of the Maserati price range -- which could set it up to capture Porsche drivers. In the first half of 2008, Maserati will also decide on a new engine and aim to cut carbon-dioxide emissions, he said. Ronchi said Maserati could also consider a hybrid engine, but because of the subsidiary's small size, it may not be able to fund the construction of an all-new hybrid.
