 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Biotechnology company Genentech Inc DNA.N said on Monday its fourth-quarter profit rose 6.4 percent, but sales of its blockbuster cancer drug and others fell short of investor expectations, sending the company's shares lower. 

 "Every single product relative to Street consensus was light. When you've got the biggest products that are the biggest growth drivers -- Avastin and Lucentis -- light, that's disappointing," said Mike King, an analyst at Rodman and Renshaw. The world's second-largest biotechnology company by sales posted a net profit of $632 million, or 59 cents a share, compared with a profit of $594 million, or 55 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding items, South San Francisco, California-based Genentech earned 69 cents a share, beating the average analyst estimate of 67 cents a share, as compiled by Reuters Estimates. For full-year 2008, the company expects earnings per share of $3.30 to $3.45, compared with the $3.38 per share forecast by Wall Street analysts. Quarterly U.S. sales of the colon-cancer and lung-cancer drug, Avastin, which most analysts view as the key barometer of Genentech's fortunes, rose 23 percent to $603 million, but still fell short of Wall Street expectations for sales near $616 million. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is expected to decide by late next month whether Avastin will also be approved to treat advanced breast cancer, but an advisory panel to the agency recommended in December that the application be turned down. Genentech's fourth-quarter revenue rose 9 percent to $2.96 billion, which was in line the $2.96 billion expected by Wall Street. U.S. product sales rose 7 percent to $2.2 billion. Domestic sales of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma drug Rituxan rose 6 percent to $596 million, while U.S. sales of breast cancer treatment Herceptin rose 2 percent to $327 million. Sales of eye-disease medicine Lucentis fell 9 percent to$197 million. Swiss drugmaker Roche Holding AG ( ROG.VX ), which owns a majority stake in Genentech, records sales of Genentech drugs outside the United States. Genentech shares, which fell about 17 percent last year, fell 2 percent in after-hours trading to $69.19 from a close of $70.64 on the New York Stock Exchange.
