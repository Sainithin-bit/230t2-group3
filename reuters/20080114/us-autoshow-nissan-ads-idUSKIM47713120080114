 DETROIT  (Reuters) - A top executive at Nissan Motor Co's ( 7201.T ) North American unit said on Monday the strike by screenwriters that has halted production on the most popular television programs was complicating his effort to revamp the Japanese automaker's U.S. marketing. 

 Mark McNabb, senior vice president for sales and marketing at Nissan North America, also acknowledged that the company's message to consumers had been "a little bit unclear" at times and said rectifying that was a priority in 2008. "We've probably wobbled a little bit at times and had some unclear messages," McNabb said in an interview with Reuters at the North American International Auto Show. "I think well try to clear that up." But those efforts will be complicated if the two-month-old Hollywood strike continues, McNabb said. "It's making it very difficult for marketers," he said of the walkout which began in early November. "Where do we want to go? Where do we want to spend money? The outcome of (the walkout) is going to be very important on what we do." McNabb downplayed U.S. dealer criticism that the Japanese automaker hadn't spent enough to advertise its new products in recent years. "I think dealers always want you to spend more, especially when times are tight and tough," McNabb said. "I would tell you that our spending on a (per new unit retailed) basis is very strong," he said. "It was probably a bit too strong in the past and has been 'level-ized.' We still spend a considerable amount of money in marketing." (Editing by  Richard Chang )
