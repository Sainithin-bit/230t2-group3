 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp's ( GM.N ) target of producing its all-electric plug-in Chevy Volt model could prove challenging for the No. 1 U.S. automaker but remains the company's target, a top executive said on Monday. 

 Briefing reporters at the North American International Auto Show, GM's vice chairman and product chief Bob Lutz described the Volt's 2010 production goal as a "big stretch." He added that producing a battery for the car has not been a problem and a working lithium ion battery pack for the Volt could be demonstrated by June 2008. But he also said the Volt is requiring a complete re-engineering for a standard passenger vehicle.
