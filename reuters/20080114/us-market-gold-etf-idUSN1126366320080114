 (Reuters) - Investment demand in precious metals 
exchange-traded funds (ETFs) remains robust as gold and other 
precious metals are trading at or near their record highs. 

 Changes in gold and silver ETF holdings are closely watched 
by market participants because sharp inflows in gold ETFs could 
be a bullish signal as it shows longer-term retail and 
institutional investors are entering the market. ETFs are listed on the stock exchanges and offer investors 
exposure in the underlying commodity -- gold -- without taking 
physical delivery. Sponsors of such funds buy a matching amount 
of the commodity from the market to keep in bank vaults. U.S.-based StreetTRACKS gold shares GLD.N is the world's 
largest gold ETF accounting for more than 80 percent of the 
metal held by all such funds, while iShares silver trust 
SLV.A is the top silver fund. For more details on gold ETFs, click within the brackets
