 ZURICH  (Reuters) - UBS ( UBSN.VX ), struck with billions of 
dollars of writedowns on subprime exposures, is trying to 
persuade investment bankers to stay with the company by 
allowing them to sell some of their share-based bonuses after 
just one year, the Financial Times reported. 

  In a report from London, the FT said UBS had upset 
employees by capping the cash portion of bonuses and announcing 
plans to pay the rest in stock.  UBS was not immediately available to comment on the report.  Investment bankers' cash bonuses are due to be slashed this 
year after the Swiss group's 2007 profits were wiped out by 
losses in the U.S. subprime mortgage market.  Citing sources close to the bank, the newspaper said UBS 
had told staff that they could sell the additional shares after 
12 months rather than waiting for the usual three years.  The Swiss bank's depressed share valuation has made 
share-based bonuses more attractive than in previous years, the 
newspaper said.  UBS's efforts to hold on to staff highlight the challenge 
many investment banks face in rewarding and keeping staff after 
a year of huge fixed-income losses.  Banks in the United States and Europe have taken billions 
of dollars of charges on exposures to subprime mortgages -- 
loans made to borrowers with patchy credit histories -- after 
the value of mortgage-backed securities held by the banks 
plunged.  (Reporting by Andrew Hurst; Editing by Erica Billingham)
