 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. investment bank Merrill Lynch & Co Inc. MER.N is seeking about $4 billion in a second capital raising, and the Kuwait Investment Authority is expected to be a significant investor in the new deal, the Financial Times reported on Sunday, citing people familiar with the matter. 

 A deal could be announced as soon as midweek, the paper said, citing those people. It added that other investors could come from Europe. Merrill Lynch was not immediately available for comment. In December, Merrill Lynch shored up its capital base by as much as $7.5 billion after selling a stake to Singapore's government and an asset manager. (Reporting by  Megan Davies )
