 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Australian financial services and property group City Pacific Ltd CIY.AX said on Monday it had made a proposal to acquire most of MFS Ltd's MFS.AX businesses in a deal with a value of about A$1.3 billion ($1.16 billion). 

 City Pacific said the transaction, which is still subject to due diligence, would exclude MFS's Stella Tourism Group. (Reporting by James Thornhill)
