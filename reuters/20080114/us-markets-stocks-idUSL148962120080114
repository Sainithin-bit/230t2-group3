 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Stocks rose on Monday after strong results from IBM ( IBM.N ) relieved concerns about the global economy and spurred a broad rebound from last week's slide. 

 The surprise preliminary report ahead of International Business Machines Corp's scheduled earnings release on Thursday eased fears about how much a global economic slowdown would cut into corporate profits. That, in turn, could help shore up a U.S. economy that some believe is on the brink of recession. More than half of IBM's revenue gains were due to currency benefits, suggesting other companies with big foreign sales, such as McDonald's Corp ( MCD.N ) and Caterpillar Inc ( CAT.N ), could profit from the weakened dollar. "It would be good to see more results like this, as that would mean those calling for a recession were doing so prematurely," said Linda Duessel, market strategist at Federated Investors in Pittsburgh. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was up 171.85 points, or 1.36 percent, at 12,778.15. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was up 15.23 points, or 1.09 percent, at 1,416.25. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was up 38.36 points, or 1.57 percent, at 2,478.30. The rebound came after the S&P 500 posted its fourth-worst start of the year in the history of the benchmark index. At the end of last week, charts showed stocks at their most "oversold" levels since 2005. Adding to the upbeat tone, Credit Suisse raised U.S. equities to "overweight" for the first time this decade, saying the United States has historically outperformed when leading economic indicators fall "because the speed of macro and corporate policy response is best there." IBM's shares rose 5.4 percent to $102.93 and made up about 40 percent of the Dow's advance. Other blue-chip tech stocks also gained, including microchip maker Intel Corp ( INTC.O ), up 5 percent at $23.08 and computer and printer maker Hewlett-Packard ( HPQ.N ), up 2.5 percent at $46.13. The semiconductor index .SOXX rose 3 percent. Apple Inc's ( AAPL.O ) shares rose 3.5 percent to $178.78 and were the biggest boost to the Nasdaq, a day before its annual Macworld event in San Francisco. The event is the favorite venue of Apple Chief Executive Steve Jobs to roll out new products and chart the company's course for the year. Caterpillar shares rose 1.9 percent to $67.27, while McDonald's gained 1.2 percent to $54.96. IBM's earnings assessment struck a positive note in a week of crucial earnings reports that will include major banks battered by subprime losses, including Citigroup Inc ( C.N ) and Merrill Lynch & Co Inc MER.N. Citigroup and Merrill have been mentioned in news reports as seeking more cash from sovereign funds and other wealthy investors as they face heavy losses. Merrill's shares rose 2.3 percent to $55.97 and Citigroup's stock rose 1.8 percent to $29.06. But two of the largest banks in the eastern United States, M&T Bank Corp ( MTB.N ) and Sovereign Bancorp Inc SOV.N, said turmoil in credit, mortgage and real estate markets hurt fourth-quarter results. M&T Bank shares fell 1.8 percent to $72.42 and Sovereign lost 0.5 percent to $10.63, both in New York Stock Exchange trading.  Retailers were under pressure after Sears Holdings Corp ( SHLD.O ) said sales fell during the key holiday period, sending Sears shares down 5 percent to $91.38 on the Nasdaq. Also weighing on retailers were analysts' cuts in price targets on more than a dozen stocks by Goldman Sachs, including Coach Inc ( COH.N ), Tiffany & Co ( TIF.N ) and Costco Wholesale Corp ( COST.O ). Coach shares slid 4.2 percent to $25.72 and Tiffany shares fell 4.9 percent to $34.04 on the NYSE, while Costco dropped 2.6 percent to $64.71 on the Nasdaq. Trading was moderate on the NYSE, with about 1.41 billion shares changing hands, falling short of 2006's estimated daily average of 1.84 billion, while on Nasdaq, about 2.17 billion shares traded, ahead of the 2006 daily average of 2.02 billion. Advancing stocks outnumbered declining ones by a ratio of about 2 to 1 on the NYSE and by 3 to 2 on Nasdaq.
