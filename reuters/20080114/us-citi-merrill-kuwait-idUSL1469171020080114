 KUWAIT  (Reuters) - The $200 billion Kuwait Investment Authority had no immediate comment on Monday on a report it may buy into Merrill Lynch & Co Inc MER.N and Citigroup Inc ( C.N ), two U.S. banks hit by credit market losses. 

 A KIA public relations official referred calls to Managing Director Bader al-Sa'ad, who could not be reached in his office or on his mobile. The Financial Times reported on Sunday Merrill Lynch was seeking about $4 billion in a second capital raising and the KIA is expected to be a significant investor in the new deal, citing people familiar with the matter. A deal could be announced as soon as midweek, the paper said, adding that other investors could come from Europe. The paper also reported on Saturday Citigroup, the largest U.S. bank by assets, was putting the final touches to a second big fundraising, seeking up to $14 billion from Chinese, Kuwaiti and other investors. The Kuwait Investment Authority, which manages the surplus revenue of the Middle East's fourth largest oil exporter, had at least $213 billion in assets at the end of March last year, according to official data.
