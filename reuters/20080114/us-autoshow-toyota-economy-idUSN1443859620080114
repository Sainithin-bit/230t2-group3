 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T )( TM.N ) does not expect to see a U.S. recession in 2008, but sees slower economic growth in the first half of the year, a top executive at the company's U.S. operations said on Monday. 

 "In no way do we expect a recession, but we do see slower growth in the first half of 2008, followed by a better second half," Bob Carter, general manager of Toyota's U.S. operations, told Reuters at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. Carter said Toyota's U.S. January sales have been surprisingly strong so far, thanks in part to mild winter weather. Jim Lentz, president of Toyota's U.S. operations, said that January sales were "on target to be on par with last January, which I'd consider a win in the current environment." Carter said full-year sales of the company's Tundra model pickup will be a "little over" 200,000, but predicted a "challenging year" for Tundra sales due to slower U.S. construction and new pickup models from rivals Chrysler LLC and Ford Motor Co ( F.N ). Toyota Tundra sales in 2007 totaled 197,000, falling short of the company's target of 200,000. In 2007 Toyota displaced Ford as the No. 2 automaker in the U.S. market.
