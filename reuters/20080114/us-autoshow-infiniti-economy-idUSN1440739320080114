 DETROIT  (Reuters) - The head of Nissan Motor Co's ( 7201.T ) Infiniti luxury unit said on Monday that some dealers are getting nervous as the U.S. economy softens because of the "fierce competition" that prevails in their increasingly crowded end of the vehicle market. 

 But in an interview with Reuters at the North American International Auto Show, Infiniti General Manager Mark Igo expressed optimism that the more affluent consumers drawn to the Infiniti brand would be less sensitive to any downturn. "I think what the dealers are concerned about is that as the market gets soft, we're acting more like a mass market in luxury, where you're seeing incentives increase immediately," Igo said. "It used to be more stable." With analysts predicting another year-over-year decline in vehicle sales in North America in 2008, Igo said "it is going to be a tough market for everybody." If rivals react to the softening by offering incentives, Infiniti would "obviously respond," Igo said. "We have to be competitive." Still, Igo said he was less worried about the deteriorating economic backdrop because the luxury vehicle segment tends to be "less volatile" than others -- not going up as much as others when the economy is booming but not falling as much when things go soft. "Obviously whenever you hear the word 'recession' you have concerns," he said. "But the typical luxury buyer is probably not as impacted as the customer who is making the decision between food and house and car. They have a little more disposable income." Igo said a dealer in the Detroit area told him he was seeing signs of a pullback by consumers. "He's seeing a trend toward six cylinders in his other makes," Igo said. "They're coming out of eight cylinders and going into six cylinders. I don't know whether that's because of concern over the economy or green or what." (Editing by  Tim Dobbyn )
