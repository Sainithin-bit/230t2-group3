 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Upgraded pickup trucks unveiled at the Detroit Auto Show by Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) and Chrysler LLC face a weak market and tough competition, limiting the financial gains Ford can expect from its market-leading F-150, a leading analyst and auto dealer said on Monday. 

 "We expect the profit contribution from a relaunch to be muted as the new vehicles face fresh competition from one-year-old GM and Toyota pickups, as well as a soft pickup market," Lehman Brothers analyst Brian Johnson said in a note for clients. "We maintain our cautious outlook for (Ford) in 2008 and 2009," Johnson said. Ford unveiled a revamped F-150 pickup truck on Sunday, a new version of its most profitable vehicle and the best-selling vehicle in the United States. At the same time, privately held Chrysler unveiled a new version of its competing Dodge Ram. "While too early to call a winner, both vehicles appear to be evolutionary, not revolutionary," Lehman's Johnson said. He added: "While we expect some loyalist effect to help sales of the new F-150 in the second half of this year, we are worried that in the current environment, the market share gain may be even more short-lived than historically, and pricing gains may disappear." Separately, Autonation Inc. ( AN.N ) Chief Executive Mike Jackson told Reuters that despite significant improvements in both new trucks, overall sales would continue to decline because of the pressure on the U.S. housing market. "Both are terrific new trucks. Both have interesting new features. Some luxury cars don't have the interiors these trucks have," Jackson said. "But pickup truck sales cannot recover until housing recovers." Ford, which lost its No. 2 position in the U.S. market to Japanese rival Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ) last year, saw its overall U.S. sales slip 12 percent in 2007, partly because of lower demand for its pickup trucks. Ford, which lost $12.6 billion in 2006, is in the midst of a massive restructuring of its North American operations. U.S. sales of Ford's F-Series, which includes both F-150 and the Super Duty, were down 13 percent to over 690,000 vehicles last year in a segment that had an overall decline of 3 percent. The Dodge Ram, which ranks third in the pickup truck segment behind the Ford and the Chevrolet Silverado, managed to take a slightly higher share of the truck market last year but at the cost of industry-leading sales incentives. Autonation's Jackson said that while pickup truck sales could fall another 10 percent in the United States in 2008, he expected automakers would cut production rather than offer more costly incentives. "I don't expect a price war. I think they'll be restrained on the production side," he said. (Reporting by  Kevin Krolicki  and  Poornima Gupta , Editing by Peter Bohan)
