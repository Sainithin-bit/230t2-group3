 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co.( F.N ) is moving toward using computer imaging technology to design its new vehicles, a step that will save the automaker millions of dollars, Ford's director of design said on Monday. 

 Peter Horbury said the digital tools will enable Ford designers to transform a sketch into a full-size model in about two weeks time. The conventional process takes at least six weeks. "This will save us millions of dollars," he told Reuters in an interview on the sidelines of the North American International Auto Show. Ford has set up digital high-definition screens, known as power walls, to view life-size digital vehicles so designers can spot problems early, Horbury said. The digital replica, while not eliminating the need to create an expensive clay model, is more easily manipulated. The company, which lost $12.6 billion in 2006 and saw its No. 2 position in the U.S. market eclipsed by Toyota, has invested heavily in upgrading its design department. He declined to name the exact amount invested. Ford's redesigned F-150 truck, which debuted at the auto show, was partially designed with the new technology, he said. The company, which is counting on a product-led rebound, is in the midst of a restructuring in North America that includes closing more than a dozen plants and cutting nearly 50,000 jobs.
