 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A strong earnings forecast from technology leader IBM helped Wall Street to one of its few gains of a gloomy new year on Monday, but the dollar continued on its path to record lows as recession worries lingered. 

 IBM surprised analysts with a preliminary statement touting a 10 percent jump in fourth quarters sales, though most of the increase was linked to foreign operations that generate more revenue as their currencies rise against the sagging dollar. The U.S. currency's drop also buoyed gold and oil. European shares rallied on IBM's result's, after losing ground for six sessions in a row, led by tech giants Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ) and Germany's SAP ( SAPG.DE ). "Big Blue helped us. You could be bullish on tech, and anybody with business abroad is going to be helped by the lower dollar," said Warren Simpson, managing director at Stephens Capital Management in Little Rock, Arkansas. The dollar slid into a record trough versus the Swiss franc and seven-week lows against the euro and yen. Analysts said in part this reflected concerns about weak U.S. corporate profits, which are expected to fall 9.1 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, according to Reuters Estimates. Still, IBM's strong showing put a more positive spin on the impending earnings season, especially for tech companies that have big foreign operations like Intel, up 4.05 percent to $22.88 and Dell, up 2.6 percent to $21.30. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was up 116.08 points, or 0.92 percent, at 12,722.38. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was up 9.43 points, or 0.67 percent, at 1,410.45. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was up 28.52 points, or 1.17 percent, at 2,468.46. The tech stocks have been among the weakest sectors in the market. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was still down about 7.2 percent since the start of the year, and the Dow down about 4.3 percent. B But many were skeptical that the day's upturn will have much staying power, given the woes faced by the economy, exacerbated by concerns over tight credit globally. "It may not be enough to carry (the Dow) back up to 13,000. We still have myriad problems from credit issues to inflation," said Stephens Capital's Simpson. Markets in general have been ruled by speculation that Federal Reserve will need to cut rates soon, which could undermine the dollar further. Gold shot to a record $914 on expectations of a sharp cut in U.S. interest rates and further dollar weakness. Oil rose to nearly $94 a barrel amid a wider commodities rally fueled in part by the dollar drop, and bond prices fell on expectations the Federal Reserve will slash interest rates by a half a percentage point at the end of the month in an effort to spur the economy. Recession fears were further fanned by a report from Goldman Sachs that the U.S. economy was likely to tip into recession, even though IBM added a counterweight with its higher-than-expected preliminary results ahead of its scheduled report on Thursday. The FTSEurofirst 300 index  .FTEU3  of top European shares, buoyed by IBM and Wall Street, ended up 0.3 percent higher at an unofficial 1,433.20 points, down from a session high at 1,437.97 points. Banks were the top performing sectors as expectations mounted for more growth-promoting rate cuts from the Fed and other major central banks. MSCI's main world stock index .MIWD00000PUS was up 2.58 percent and its emerging market gauge .MSCIEF up 3.86 percent. Japan's stock markets were closed for a holiday. Gold's surge prompting buying of other precious metals, with platinum hitting a record high before giving up some gains and silver was quoted below a 27-year peak. "It's human nature to buy into a market that is already showing strength," said Robin Bhar, metals analyst at UBS Investment Bank. "Gold could go higher still, but we don't think this is a right time for buying." Spot gold rose $12.15, or 1.36 percent, to $907.55. A weaker dollar makes gold cheaper for holders of other currencies and often lifts bullion demand. The euro was up 0.78 percent at $1.489 and against the yen, the dollar was down 0.82 percent at 108.07. Oil halted a three-day losing streak as fear of U.S.-Iranian tensions as well as violence in Nigeria rekindled worries of potential oil supply disruption and boosted prices. The oil market is caught between short-term tight supply and downside risks to oil demand from a slowing economy, with geopolitical events and speculators driving prices in the near-term, analysts said. "The market is still finding its view on what's going to happen over the course of the year," said Simon Wardell, analyst at Global Insight. U.S. light sweet crude oil rose $1.39, or 1.5 percent, to $94.08 per barrel.
