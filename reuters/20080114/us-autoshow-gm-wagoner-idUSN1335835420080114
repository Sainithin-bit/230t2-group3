 DETROIT  (Reuters) - The top executive at General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) said on Sunday that the woes of the U.S. economy were a concern to the automaker, but predicted that the second half of 2008 would be better than the first half. 

 "There is a range of uncertainty. I think it's fair to say there has been a reasonable amount of turmoil in financial markets driven off this housing thing," said Rick Wagoner, speaking to reporters at the North American International Auto Show. Higher gasoline prices combined with a weak housing market have raised concerns that the U.S. economy could tip into recession in 2008 and cause consumers to delay big-ticket purchases such as new vehicles. U.S. auto sales fell for the second consecutive year in 2007, dragged down by a slowing economy, a slumping housing market and tighter credit markets that pinched less creditworthy borrowers. While the consensus view among Wall Street analysts and high-profile investors points to a further decline in the world industry's single largest market in 2008, there is still a debate about how deep it will go -- especially if the U.S. economy tips into outright recession. Analysts agree that a decline of a high magnitude would force more sweeping production cuts and job losses, especially among the Detroit-based automakers that have been banking on a turnaround after already wrenching restructurings. Wagoner said a worsening economy could slow down GM's North American turnaround, which has included slashing more than 34,000 jobs and closing 12 plants. The automaker, which lost more than $10 billion in 2005 and 2006, has also cut structural costs by $9 billion. "The probability of it getting worse looks quite low," Wagoner said. "But sure it would slow down the turnaround. We need to work on cost and revenue. And obviously it would slow down revenue, which would slow down the financial results." Full-year 2007 sales dropped almost 3 percent to 16.14 million vehicles, the lowest since 1998. Wagoner said he expects the market in 2008 to be about as tough as the year just ended, estimating total U.S. industry sales to come in at 16.3 million to 16.5 million units. On a light vehicle basis, that would be 16 million to 16.2 million vehicles. "Maybe the range of outcomes is a little broader than what we'd be normally be expecting at this point. Could it come under pressure if things really got worse? Sure," Wagoner said. "But it will be more in this range, not radically smaller or radically better." MORE BUYOUTS SOON Wagoner said he expects most of the cost savings from a recent labor deal with the United Auto Workers union to be realized in 2009 and 2010, adding that he expects to announce additional buyouts of the blue-collar work force soon. "We are working with the UAW on a broader program ... We'll have something to say about that very soon," Wagoner said, adding: "Quite soon in fact." GM's head of North American operations, Troy Clarke, said the automaker could announce the new attrition plan within a week. Wagoner said GM could begin hiring low-wage union workers -- a provision it garnered as part of the new labor contract -- as soon as the second quarter of this year. GM is working with the UAW to offer buyouts to current UAW workers, paving the way for thousands of employees to be hired at wages less than half that of GM's current hourly workers. The automaker last month said it was offering buyouts to 5,200 workers, and is now working to cut a deal on a second phase of retirement and buyout offers for more employees in its 72,000 blue-collar employees. "We are still working through the timing with the UAW," Wagoner said. "The first wave has some opportunities for hiring of tier two. We see some potential opportunity for second-tier hires in the second quarter, third quarter." Analysts expect the entire attrition program to net 11,000 jobs in 2008. A $3,500 CAR Wagoner also said that GM has no immediate plans to compete directly with the "Nano" -- the world's cheapest car made by Indian automaker Tata Motors ( TAMO.BO ) and sold for about $2,500 -- but said he was open to the idea of entering that segment in India. "At this point we want to grow aggressively (in India)," Wagoner said. "Whether we eventually get into that product segment, we haven't made a call yet." Wagoner said the automaker is working on developing a cheap car for emerging markets, which could be sold for as little as $3,500 -- a price tag that already exists on its Wuling utility vehicles in China. "We are working on lower-cost architectures for emerging markets," Wagoner said. "It wouldn't work in the U.S. or Europe." Tata launched the Nano in India earlier this month. "We have a reasonable amount of experience with low-cost vehicles in other parts of the world," Wagoner said. "And we are anxious to see how that specific initiative goes in India before we make any decisions." (For more on the Detroit Auto Show in Reuters blogs, see  here ) (Reporting by Jui Chakravorty)
