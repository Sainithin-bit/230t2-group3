 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Microsoft said on Monday it would cooperate fully with the European Commission in its new investigation of the software giant for possible fresh antitrust violations. 

 "We will cooperate fully with the Commission's investigation and provide any and all information necessary," the company said in a statement. "We are committed to ensuring that Microsoft is in full compliance with European law and court obligations as established by the European Court of First Instance in its September 2007 ruling."
