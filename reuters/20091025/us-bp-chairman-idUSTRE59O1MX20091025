 LONDON  (Reuters) - BP's ( BP.L ) incoming chairman, the former Ericsson ( ERICb.ST ) boss Carl-Henric Svanberg, will lead a shake-up of the oil giant's boardroom when he takes over, The Sunday Times reported. 

 "From my point of view, that is not a negative. They probably held back a bit on changes because they were waiting for this change," Svanberg told the paper in an interview. BP Deputy Chairman Ian Prosser and Erroll Davis, a non-executive board member, are expected to leave next year after more than a decade on the board, with DeAnne Julius exiting by 2011, the paper said. The company is already looking for a replacement for Tom McKillop, who stepped down in April because of his involvement with the Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ).
