 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Investors should swap their shares of Yahoo Inc ( YHOO.O ) for those of Google Inc ( GOOG.O ) because Yahoo's advertising revenues are on the decline while Google's are rising, Barron's reported in its October 26 edition. 

 Google's cost to acquire new subscribers is also falling and its marketshare for Web search grew in September while Yahoo's did not, Barron's wrote. "What would you pay, then, for a company that's cutting expenses to the bone and producing only 'less bad' results? You certainly wouldn't want to pay what Yahoo! is fetching," Barron's wrote.
