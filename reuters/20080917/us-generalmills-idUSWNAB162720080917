 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - General Mills Inc ( GIS.N ) posted a higher-than-expected quarterly profit and raised its full-year forecast on Wednesday as consumers bought more cake mixes and frozen pizzas to save money. 

 The maker of Cheerios cereal, Betty Crocker baking mixes and Green Giant vegetables said earnings fell 3.6 percent to $278.5 million, or 79 cents a share, in the first quarter ended on August 24 from $288.9 million, or 81 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding a reduction tied to the value of commodity positions, earnings rose 19 percent to 96 cents per share and beat the analysts' average forecast of 87 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 14 percent to $3.5 billion, topping analysts' estimates of $3.3 billion. Sales in the U.S. baking products division soared 25 percent as cash-strapped U.S. consumers started to make more meals at home rather than dine out. Like many food companies, General Mills has been hit by soaring prices for grains and other commodities, although those prices have begun to decline a bit in recent weeks. The company has raised prices and taken a variety of actions to offset some of those cost increases, while still investing in marketing and new product development. In June, General Mills said it would introduce 300 new products this year. General Mills still estimates that its costs will rise 9 percent this year, Chief Executive Ken Powell said in a statement. The company said it would record a gain on the sale of its Pop Secret microwave popcorn business to Diamond Foods Inc ( DMND.O ) in the second quarter. Excluding that gain and assuming no impact from the valuation of commodity positions, General Mills now expects to earn $3.81 to $3.85 per share this year, up from a prior target of $3.78 to $3.83. Analysts were expecting $3.84. The company expects sales to grow at a mid single-digit percentage rate this year, driven in part by price increases.
