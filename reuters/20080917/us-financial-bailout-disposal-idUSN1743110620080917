 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Wall Street's turmoil and the Bush administration's erratic responses are stirring interest in a potentially more decisive approach -- a temporary agency to dispose of the toxic debt poisoning the system. 

 Various models -- the Resolution Trust Corp (RTC) of the 1980s and 1990s, as well as the Home Owners' Loan Corp and Reconstruction Finance Corp of the 1930s -- are being discussed by lawmakers, veteran regulators, academics and analysts. The chances of creating some sort of dumping ground for bad mortgage paper in the next few weeks are slim, but the idea is gaining traction as the markets continue sliding downhill. "Planning should begin for such a possibility. I think that would be the last thing to do. But it may be something we have to do," said Moody's Economy.com Chief Economist Mark Zandi. As the stock market plunged again on Wednesday, Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd said there was no time left to tackle creating a debt disposal agency in the current Congress, which is set to adjourn next week. "The Obama Administration or the McCain administration will have to assess whether they want to propose such an idea. I'm willing to entertain one," Dodd said, referring to presidential candidates Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain. Bush administration sources indicated that, with Congress set to leave, it was unlikely an RTC-style agency could be set up soon enough to significantly ease market pressures, and it preferred to concentrate on measures that can work quickly. White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said, "I wouldn't rule it out, but I'm not saying that it's necessarily on the list of issues that we're trying to deal with right now." The RTC liquidated almost $400 billion in assets from more than 700 insolvent savings and loans from 1989 to 1995. EX-REGULATORS URGE ACTION Three former top regulators, writing in The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday, called for establishing an RTC-style entity that could trim "decaying tissue" from the market. Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, former Comptroller of the Currency Eugene Ludwig and former Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said such a body could buy up troubled real estate debt to get credit markets working again. While proposals for a bad debt disposal agency have been kicked around for months, the latest debate was triggered on Monday by House of Representatives Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat. He said then that he could envision exploring an RTC-style solution to the market's troubles after November's election. On Wednesday, he told CNBC television: "We now have a situation with the Bush administration ... this pattern of ad hoc intervention. I don't think that's appropriate. "We have to consider whether or not we need to create another entity ... There would be some sort of limitation in terms of time," he said, adding no firm proposal exists yet. Stanford Group Co policy analyst Jaret Seiberg said the RTC model is a poor fit for today because it was established to dispose of assets the government obtained when S&Ls failed. At the moment, he said, the government does not own the mortgages underlying the broken debt instruments that are clogging up the credit markets. This troubled paper needs to be purchased by the government and taken out of the system. DEPRESSION AGENCIES EYED "A closer analogy would be the Home Owners' Loan Corp (HOLC), which in simple terms is the Depression-era agency that issued bonds to refinance borrowers," Seiberg said. The HOLC was set up by President Franklin Roosevelt in the 1930s to refinance homes to prevent foreclosures and to assist lenders by refinancing troubled loans and providing liquidity. Brookings Institution economist Robert Litan said the Depression-era Reconstruction Finance Corp, which pumped federal money into private companies, could be a worthy model. "It was not a dumping ground. It was basically an expanded version of what the Fed did with AIG," Litan said. The government on Tuesday announced it would lend $85 billion to American International Group Inc in exchange for an 80 percent stake in the insurer, in a move that was aimed at preventing the company's bankruptcy. The AIG bailout was the latest in a series of emergency measures taken this year by the Bush administration, including the federal seizure of mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the government-engineered buyout of investment bank Bear Stearns by JPMorgan Chase & Co. These moves, along with steps by the Fed to make more capital available to investment banks, have failed to stem growing market anxiety, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling another 4 percent on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.
