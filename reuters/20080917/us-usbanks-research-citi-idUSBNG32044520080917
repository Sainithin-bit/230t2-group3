 (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp and Wachovia Corp will be the hardest hit among U.S. banks from their exposure to Lehman Brothers, Citigroup analyst Keith Horowitz said. 

 Assuming that the Lehman Brothers commercial paper is marked at "zero," Bank of America's third-quarter earnings are expected to be hurt by 5 cents a share, while Wachovia could lose about 15 cents from its exposure, Horowitz said. Wells Fargo & Co could also see an impact of 4 cents a share on its third-quarter earnings, he said. JPMorgan Chase & Co would avoid any impact as it does not seem to have exposure currently, the analyst said. Lehman Brothers, once an investment banking giant, filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday after trying to finance too many risky assets with too little capital.
