 ZURICH  (Reuters) - UBS shares tumbled for a second day in a row on Tuesday, closing down 17 percent, although they recovered slightly after the bank said the cost of closing its exposure to Lehman Brothers would not exceed $300 million. 

 UBS chief executive Marcel Rohner said in a TV interview that the bank was prepared to weather the current market turmoil. "We are glad that we have taken the painful measures early -- the capital increase, the strong risk reduction," UBS CEO Marcel Rohner told Swiss TV channel SF1. "So we are now prepared to deal with this very difficult situation." UBS AG ( UBSN.VX ) shares fell to their lowest since listing in their current form in 1998, as soaring interbank loan rates exacerbated the worries of investors about the sector's prospects after the collapse of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEH.N. Rohner said in a second interview with SF1, the events in the United States would show up in the bank's results. "It will certainly have an impact, but it's hard to tell how strongly. Volatility is very high," Rohner said. The bank was better prepared to deal with the crisis than pure investment banks thanks to its broader business model, Rohner said. "What we have seen now is a worsening of the crisis, which nobody could have expected. But we are nevertheless convinced that we are able to deal with it," Rohner said. STORM Tuesday's share fall comes on top of a 15 percent decline on Monday that had reversed a steady recovery from the previous all-time low, hit in July. "UBS confirms that its direct and counterparty exposures to Lehman Brothers, net of hedges, are now substantially closed out. UBS does not expect the total cost of closing out its exposures to Lehman Brothers to exceed $300 million," the bank said in a statement. The Swiss bank giant said it decided to put out a statement on its exposure to Lehman after research by Bernstein suggested UBS would have to pay a much bigger price. UBS shares closed down 17.21 percent at 16.64 Swiss francs, off an intraday low of 15.18 Swiss francs after it recouped some losses following the release of its statement. But it was still the second worst performing European bank share on Tuesday. Only HBOS Plc HBOS.L, Britain's biggest home-lender, lost more, falling 21.7 percent. News of a slump in profit at U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs also added to the pressure on the overall banking sector. "The current events in the United States show that it is still too early to say the storm is over," Swiss National Bank Vice-Chairman Philip Hildebrand said in a speech on Tuesday. The shares of UBS's direct rival Credit Suisse Group AG( CSGN.VX ) closed down 4.69 percent at 47.18 Swiss francs. UBS has written down $42 billion of assets as a result of the subprime crisis, more than any other bank in Europe so far. But it has rebuilt its capital base after tapping investors twice this year and is better capitalized than U.S. banks. Its Tier 1 ratio, a measure of regulatory capital banks put aside against risk, stood at 11.6 percent at the end of June and Swiss regulators are coming forward with more stringent capital and liquidity requirements for both UBS and Credit Suisse. UBS has also taken steps to split its capital-intensive investment bank from its profitable wealth management business and said it will go back to profit in 2009.
