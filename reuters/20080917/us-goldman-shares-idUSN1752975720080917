 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) dropped below $100 for the first time in more than three years on Wednesday as concerns over the outlook for the remaining U.S. investment banks swelled. 

 Goldman shares fell more than 20 percent, taking the stock as low as $97.78 on the New York Stock Exchange. Goldman last traded below $100 in June 2005. Shares of rival investment bank Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) slid more than 30 percent to $19.91. (Reporting by  Ellis Mnyandu ; Editing by Tom Hals)
