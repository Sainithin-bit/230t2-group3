 TOKYO  (Reuters) - The Tokyo Stock Exchange said on Wednesday it has halted trading in American International Group Inc shares for the time being. 

 A source briefed on the matter said the Federal Reserve will extend AIG $85 billion in exchange for a nearly 80 percent stake to bail out the troubled insurance giant. (Reporting by Sachi Izumi)
