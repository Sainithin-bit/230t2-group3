 (Reuters) - U.S. federal regulators recently called a number of banks asking if they would consider buying Washington Mutual Inc should it eventually falter, the New York Post said, citing sources. 

 Federal banking regulators, in recent days, contacted Wells Fargo & Co, JPMorgan Chase & Co, HSBC and several other financial institutions to gauge their interest in a possible acquisition of WaMu, the paper said. No merger discussions are currently under way between the Seattle-based bank and anyone else, the sources told the paper. Washington Mutual could not be immediately reached for comment.
