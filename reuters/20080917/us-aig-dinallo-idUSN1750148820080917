 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - New York Insurance Superintendent Eric Dinallo said on Wednesday that assets of insurer American International Group have attracted strong interest but acknowledged that the company may need more capital. 

 "There is extremely strong interest in core assets from top-tier companies," said Dinallo, speaking on CNBC. U.S. authorities pieced together an emergency $85 billion rescue of AIG to stave off a bankruptcy that could have thrown world markets into deeper turmoil.
