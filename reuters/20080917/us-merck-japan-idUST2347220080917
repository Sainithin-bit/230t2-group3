 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc's ( MRK.N ) Japan unit said on Wednesday it will more than halve the number of its sales branches and offices nationwide, as part of a global strategic review by its U.S parent. 

 Banyu Pharmaceutical Co. will slash the number of its branches and offices to 20 by spring from the current 71. It will also makes changes to headcount, which is currently 3,700 and includes 1,700 sales representatives, a Banyu spokeswoman said, but declined to provide further details. Merck, whose earnings have been hurt by disappointing sales of its Vytorin cholesterol fighter and generic competition for its older Zocor cholesterol drug, cut 1,200 U.S. sales jobs earlier this year. The job cuts were part of a global restructuring plan announced in late 2005, meant to generate a total of $4.5 billion to $5 billion in savings through 2010. Other rivals have also trimmed their Japan operations. Pfizer Inc ( PFE.N ) spun off part of a Japan laboratory, which had 400 employees, as part of a major global restructuring.
