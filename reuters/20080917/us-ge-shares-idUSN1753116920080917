 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Electric Co ( GE.N ) shares tumbled 6.6 percent on Wednesday, even as the conglomerate's chief executive said people should be "concerned but not panicked" about the financial crisis. 

 GE has lost about 17 percent of its market value, or $46.7 billion, over the past week, as the bankruptcy of investment bank Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc and a U.S. government bailout of insurer American International Group Inc ( AIG.N ) spooked investors. "People should be concerned, but not panicked," GE chief Jeff Immelt said in an discussion with Google Inc ( GOOG.O ) Chief Executive Eric Schmidt at a conference organized by the Internet giant. "So far, the Fed and Treasury have been doing the right things. GE capital is a part of GE but we earned $5.2 billion through the first half of the year. We do boring stuff fundamentally in financial services. And I'm proud of that." GE shares have sold off as investors worried that the trouble at Lehman, AIG and other large financial services firms may be a warning sign about GE Capital. While GE is best known for making heavy equipment like electricity-generating wind turbines and railroad locomotive, it earns about half its profits through its financial arm. "This is about the fallout in the financial world," said Brian Langenberg, principal at Langenberg & Co in New York. "In the last week, we've seen the fire sale of Lehman, Merrill Lynch running into the arms of a bank, we've seen AIG bailed out. Anything out there that is financial services is at risk." The question worrying investors, Langenberg said, is "What are the risks on the balance sheet?" A GE spokesman said the company's triple-A credit rating remains secure, that its exposure to Lehman Brothers was "immaterial" and that its exposure to AIG has been "resolved" by the U.S. government's $85 billion in rescue loans to the insurer. "We're committed to the triple-A. We have strong cash flow and a diversified portfolio and even in this difficult environment the triple A remains secure," said Russell Wilkerson, a spokesman for the conglomerate. ECHOES OF FIRST QUARTER GE's 6 percent first-quarter profit drop, which stunned investors who had been looking for growth, came at another time of market turbulence following the near-collapse of Bear Stearns. The slide in GE's shares continued despite a Sunday letter to investors posted on the company's website that emphasized that its finance arm is stable and confirmed that its commercial real estate unit expects to earn $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion this year. "We were surprised that the company reiterated prior guidance of $1.5-$1.7B over the weekend given what competitors are saying about commercial real estate market," wrote Credit Suisse analyst Nicole Parent, in a note to clients. "Investors fear a repeat of Q1 miss related to (GE Capital), which is what's getting priced into the stock." The cost to insure the conglomerate's debt rose 30 percent to $510,000 per year for five years to insure $10 million in debt, according to Markit Intraday. JPMorgan analyst Stephen Tusa in a note to clients said he expects profit at GE's financial arm, which accounts for about half its profit, to fall 5 percent to 10 percent in 2009. "We see the potential for another year of decline at GE Capital," Tusa wrote. GE shares fell $1.67 to $23.39 on the New York Stock Exchange. GE's drop was deeper than the 4.1 percent slide of the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  and the 4.7 percent fall of the broad Standard & Poor's 500 index  .SPX . The past week's slide in GE shares have cost the Fairfield, Connecticut-based company its position as the second-largest U.S. company by market capitalization. It now ranks third, behind Exxon Mobil Corp ( XOM.N ) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc  ( WMT.N ).
