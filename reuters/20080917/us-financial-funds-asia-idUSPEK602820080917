 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Fund managers in Asia are sticking to defensive plays and keeping cash levels high as they shrug off a U.S. government rescue of insurer AIG amid fears of more bad news and threats to global economic growth. 

 Even as valuations tumble from the lofty levels seen during the recent bull run, money managers said they would need greater clarity before significantly increasing the level of risk in their portfolios. "It's still relatively early to say that we've seen the bottom, because the economic growth process is going to be delayed. So we're likely to see more subdued growth going into next year and probably the year after that," said Ronald Chan, CIO, Asian equities with Fortis Investments. The Hong Kong-based fund manager, who oversees about $1.5 billion, said he is underweight cyclical stocks and favoring defensive plays such as telecoms companies and more conservatively managed banks. Cash levels in his portfolios are "on the high side." U.S. authorities pieced together an $85 billion rescue of insurer American International Group Inc late on Tuesday to stave off a bankruptcy that could have thrown world markets into deeper turmoil. Equities rose and government bond prices weakened as reports about the plan surfaced, though the stock market response in Asia on Wednesday was tepid. The MSCI Asia-Pacific ex-Japan stock index was up 0.8 percent, after hitting a 2-year low on Tuesday. It is down 37 percent so far this year. "It's too early to call for a bottom because the subprime problem has blown up, but what about the other parts of the mortgage market in the U.S.?" said Winson Fong, head of greater China equities for Societe Generale Asset Management. "There will be a lot of deleveraging, a lot of selldowns, layoffs, restructuring, etc. There will be a lot of these things to happen in the coming months, if not years." Fong, who helps to oversee about $3 billion in assets, said he was overweight consumer non-cyclical stocks such as food and beverage companies which will benefit from reduced cost pressures as inflation cools. He said cash levels were at an unusually high 3-5 percent, partly because of the risk of redemptions. He was underweight commodity and materials plays, where he said valuations went through "a bubble". The Hong Kong-based manager said he was also wary of Chinese banks, which are "probably overowned" by big funds and could suffer as investors adjust portfolios. But Fong said he took some comfort from the fact that many stocks were trading at single digit price earnings ratios, which provide downside protection even if results forecasts are revised lower. Citigroup Global Markets estimated on Tuesday that Chinese stocks were trading at 9.8 times 2009 earnings, with South Korean stocks at 9.2 times, Thai stocks at 8.1 times and Indonesian stocks at 7.5 times. One Hong Kong-based chief investment officer for a European fund manager, who declined to speak on the record because of the sensitivity of the market situation, said valuations looked very good on a long-term basis but that the strain on the global financial system made his firm unwilling to buy. "Do you take a view on this stuff? No. Not right now. On a day to day basis, the events unfolding are extremely unpredictable," he said. "The best thing to do is if you haven't got a strong view, stay where you were or in a general sense be neutral. I don't think you can do very much in this environment right now. There's not enough transparency." Tahnoon Pasha, head of Asian equities investments with Manulife Asset Management in Hong Kong, said investors should expect further volatility in the near term. "It's still a stock pickers market. But I think there's a great deal of long-term value emerging. So ask me what I think from an 18-month view, I would be positive. But in the shorter term it's still very murky out there." (Editing by  Ian Geoghegan )
