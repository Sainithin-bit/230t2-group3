 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley said on Tuesday its third-quarter earnings fell nearly 3 percent, trouncing expectations, even as the year-old credit crunch slowed deal activity to a crawl and created one the toughest trading environments in decades. 

 The No. 2 U.S. investment bank reported income from continuing operations fell to $1.43 billion, or $1.32 a share, for the quarter ended August 31, from $1.47 billion, or $1.38, a year earlier. Net revenue rose 1 percent to $8.0 billion from last year. Analysts, on average, looked for revenue of $6.3 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Morgan Stanley shares closed down 11 percent Tuesday. Rival Goldman Sachs said third-quarter earnings dropped 70 percent, marked by sharply lower banking, trading and investment results.
