 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Levels of reserves in the banking system are estimated to be "abundant" for today, said the New York Federal Reserve in a statement about its open market operations on its website on Wednesday. 

 The U.S. central bank stands ready to conduct open market operations later today if needed, the statement said. So far on Wednesday, the New York Fed has refrained from any open market operations, it said. Typically the New York Fed conducts open market operations at 9:30 a.m. EDT. The regional Fed conducts these operations for the central bank system to meet its bank reserve and interest rate targets. The Federal Reserve, along with some other global central banks, has injected huge amounts of extra temporary liquidity to the financial system so far this week, in response to what market analysts and traders say is a near paralyzation of interbank lending markets. The New York Federal Reserve Website statement said: "Estimates show that reserve levels for today are abundant. The Desk stands ready to arrange operations later in the day if needed." Federal funds in the U.S. overnight interbank market last traded at 3.0 percent, above the target rate of 2.0 percent the Federal Reserve sets.
