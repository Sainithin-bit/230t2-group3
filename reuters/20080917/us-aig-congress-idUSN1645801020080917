 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said on Tuesday he met with Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke to discuss the latest rescue ideas for insurer American International Group Inc ( AIG.N ) but he offered no details. 

 "They expressed the administration's views on the deepening economic turmoil and shared with us their latest proposals regarding AIG," Reid said in a statement, saying the meeting was at the Bush administration's request. "The Treasury and the Fed have promised to provide more details in the near future, which I believe must address the broader, underlying structural issues in the financial markets," the Nevada Democrat said.
