 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - CME Group said on Tuesday that it took emergency action on Tuesday permitting limited block trades by American International Group Inc in certain CME and CBOT commodity future products to help protect orderly functioning of the market. 

 The derivatives exchange said the order would facilitate the reduction of the positions of AIG and its subsidiaries. It permitted block trades, which are held outside the public auction market, of futures products such as soybeans, soybean oil, corn, wheat, live cattle and lean hogs. It said that the order was effective through September 17 A spokesperson for The New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc, a subsidiary of NYMEX Holdings Inc was not immediately available for comment A representative for the Intercontinental Exchange was not immediately available for comment (Reporting by  Sinead Carew ; Editing by  Gary Hill )
