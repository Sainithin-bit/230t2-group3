 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers are looking for ways to cover the cost of granting the Federal Reserve authority to begin paying interest on bank reserves held at the Fed this year, Rep. Barney Frank said on Wednesday. 

 "We're trying to find a way to pay it," the head of the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee told reporters. "It would cost about $300 million. We're trying to work that out" in a temporary bill to fund government operations. Congress needs to pass a stopgap, catchall spending bill by the start of the new fiscal year on October 1. It is not clear how long a period that bill will cover and it might need to do another one before it expires. The Fed asked Congress in the spring for the authority to start paying interest on the reserves commercial banks hold at the central bank as it sought a new tool to combat the credit crisis. If the Fed had such authority, it could flood the banking system with excess cash without fear the overnight federal funds rate -- its main economic policy lever -- would plunge in a manner that could set off inflation. Banks must meet set reserve requirements, but since they receive no interest on those reserves, they have an incentive to lend out any excess cash in the open market, pressuring interest rates lower. If the Fed could pay interest on reserves, it could put a floor under benchmark rates. Lawmakers gave the Fed permission in 2006 to pay interest but set 2011 as the effective date as a way to hold down the budgetary costs. Jaret Seiberg, an analyst at Stanford Group Company, said the chances of Congress giving the Fed this authority are increasing. "Such a move would give the Fed more control over interest rates that banks charge each other for overnight loans, which would free the Fed to expand its balance sheet through these new lending facilities," Seiberg said.
