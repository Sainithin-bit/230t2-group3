 BOSTON  (Reuters) - The $11.6 trillion U.S. fund industry sought to reassure jittery investors on Wednesday that their money was safe after the first collapse of a money-market fund below the critical $1 a share level in 14 years. 

 Legg Mason Inc ( LM.N ), Fidelity Investments, BlackRock Inc ( BLK.N ), Vanguard Group and Invesco Ltd ( IVZ.N ) said their money-market funds were stable with little or no exposure to foundering U.S. financial firms. Money market funds are regarded as super-safe vehicles, buying interest-bearing securities that mature within a year, and frequently within a week or month. They lack federal deposit insurance, but are priced at $1 per share and are never supposed to fall below that level -- an event known as "breaking the buck." But on Tuesday, the New York-based Reserve Primary Fund, one of the oldest and biggest money-market funds, said its shares fell below that threshold due to losses on debt issued by Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEH.PLEH.N. The fund, whose chairman Bruce Bent is known as the "father" of the industry after creating the first money market mutual fund in 1970 with a partner, saw its assets more than halved to $23 billion by Tuesday from $65 billion on August 31. It marked the first such loss at a money-market fund since 1994, when Community Bankers, a small institutional money-market fund, paid investors just 94 cents on the dollar. Mike McNamee, a spokesman for the Washington-based Investment Company Institute, a fund industry trade group, said the fundamental structure of money market funds remains sound. "Millions of investors have benefited from its tight regulation and strict quality control. And that is as true today as it was yesterday," he said. Several firms expressed confidence in their products. "The net-asset values (NAVs) of Legg Mason money market funds remain stable," Legg Mason, the second-largest publicly traded U.S. asset manager, said on its website. Squeezed by the deteriorating values of some money-market fund securities, Legg has spent $1.1 billion to support the funds since late 2007, triggering losses in the past two quarters. Fidelity, the world's biggest mutual fund company, said its funds had "modest" exposure to Lehman and American International Group ( AIG.N ). Lehman sought bankruptcy protection on Monday. On Tuesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve pieced together an emergency $85 billion rescue of AIG. While the turmoil is unlikely to spark an exodus from the $3.5 trillion money funds industry, it could cause investors to switch to bigger and more stable firms. "Funds managed by smaller asset managers may see a greater rate of redemptions," J.P. Morgan Securities' analyst Alex Roever said in a note to clients. But he added, "We do not expect a massive wave of money fund redemptions tied to this event." Losses on Lehman's securities are forcing some institutions to shore up their money funds. Evergreen Investments said on Wednesday its parent Wachovia Corp WB.N will 'support' three Evergreen money market funds to prevent those shares from falling. The three funds had credit exposure of $494 million to Lehman as of September 12, Evergreen said. Sandler O'Neill & Partners said in a research note the deal could mean a pretax charge of $494 million, or 15 cents a share after tax, for Wachovia in its third-quarter 2008 earnings. Wachovia shares closed down 20.8 percent on the New York Stock Exchange to end the day at $9.12. The Dow Jones Industrial average lost 449.36 points, or 4.06 percent, to end trade at 10,609.66.
