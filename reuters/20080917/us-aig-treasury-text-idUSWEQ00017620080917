 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The following is the text of a statement by U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on American International Group Inc released on Tuesday: 

 "These are challenging times for our financial markets.

I support the steps taken by the Federal Reserve tonight to assist AIG in continuing to meet its obligations, mitigate broader disruptions and at the same time protect the taxpayers."
