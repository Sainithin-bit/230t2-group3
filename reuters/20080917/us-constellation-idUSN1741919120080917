 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. power company Constellation Energy Group CEG.N on Wednesday said it was in talks with potential buyers or partners as it moved to quash investor fears about the liquidity of its trading business. 

 Still, the company's shares erased early gains and fell as much as 45 percent in afternoon trading despite its statement that its bankers remained committed to a $2 billion line of credit it picked up late last month. The company's stock has shed more than 60 percent in the past three days, by far the worst performer in the utilities sector, on concerns about the lack of counterparties for the trading business due to the current financial crisis. Credit rating agency Standard & Poor's said it may cut its 'BBB' ratings on the company's debt if Constellation did not take rapid action to shore up its balance sheet. S&P said that if those actions were not taken, "a multiple-notch downgrade is likely," which could require a cash infusion for collateral to support Constellation's trading operations. "We do not expect the company to withstand such a rating action," S&P said. S&P said it had confirmed Constellation management's statement that Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ) and UBS' commitments for a $2 billion credit facility remained strong, and said the Baltimore-based company had informed it that talks regarding an outright sale of the company were at "an advanced stage." The company declined to comment on potential buyers or whether it would seek to sell the company in its entirety. Constellation has hired Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) and UBS ( UBSN.VX ) to advise it on strategic alternatives. An outright sale of the company might be the only path open for Constellation, Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Hugh Wynne said. "You need somebody that's well-capitalized and unaffected by the credit crisis and that, I think, precludes the normal path, which would be to go to Wall Street and find someone who wants to take on more trading business," he said. "That doesn't sound like it's going to work." He said France's EDF SA ( EDF.PA ), which already owns nearly 10 percent of Constellation, and Exelon Corp ( EXC.N ) could be good fits. EDF recently doubled its stake in Constellation to 9.51 percent, under an agreement that limited the French company's purchases to 9.9 percent of the company. EDF was unavailable for comment, and Exelon declined to comment. 'ACUTE CRISIS' The company's trading business has been a drag on its stock since August, when Constellation disclosed that a credit rating downgrade could force it to post billions of dollars of extra collateral. It later took steps to shore up its liquidity, including making an agreement for the additional $2 billion credit facility. Wynne said the trading business has been well-run since its inception, but could still be a problem in the current credit environment. "The trading business is one that relies on ready access to liquidity," he said. "There's a time when you can take that type of risk, when markets are awash with liquidity, and there's a time when you can't, like today." More than 80 percent of Constellation's total revenue of $9.9 billion in the first half of 2009 came from trading and its industry-leading wholesale power sales arm, while the rest came from its sale of electricity and gas into regulated markets. Despite the reassurances about the $2 billion credit line, S&P warned the company still faced hurdles. "Constellation is facing an acute crisis of confidence that has resulted in a decline in its stock price and a widening of its five-year (credit default swaps) spreads," S&P said, noting that some of its trading counterparties may have started backing away from new deals. The cost to insure Constellation's debt in the credit derivative market soared 30 percent on Wednesday to new record of 794 basis points, or $794,000 per year for five years to insure $10 million in debt, according to Markit Intraday. Another analyst said Constellation could also seek a partner with a strong balance sheet to back up its trading operation, much like Sempra Energy ( SRE.N ) did with RBS. "I don't think they need to be bought totally, they may just need a partner for the trading book," said Dot Matthews, analyst with CreditSights. Constellation, the power and gas wholesaler and owner of Baltimore Gas & Electric also reiterated that its exposure to financial institutions was limited, and that its credit exposure to the banks was about $120 million. Its exposure was no higher than $28 million to any single financial institution. The company also reaffirmed its third-quarter forecast of earnings of 83 cents to 99 cents per share and full-year earnings of $5.25 to $5.75. Shares of Constellation were down 25 percent at $22.99 on the New York Stock Exchange, well below their 52-week high of $107.97 on January 8. The stock traded as low at $16.70 earlier in the day.
