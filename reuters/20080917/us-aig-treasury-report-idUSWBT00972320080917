 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury on Tuesday declined to comment on a Bloomberg News report that the Federal Reserve was considering extending a "loan package" to American International Group to ease a cash shortage. 

 "We are focused on market developments," Treasury spokeswoman Brookly McLaughlin said, declining to comment on the report. U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson is in Washington and was scheduled to participate in a meeting at the White House of President George W. Bush's Working Group on Financial Markets at around 3:30 p.m. The group also includes Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Christopher Cox and other officials.
