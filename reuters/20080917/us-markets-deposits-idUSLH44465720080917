 NEW YORK/LONDON  (Reuters) - The cost of short-term borrowing climbed on Wednesday, as financial institutions' distrust and fear of lending to each other deepened and the global financial crisis intensified. 

 The interbank cost of borrowing three-month dollars posted its biggest daily gain in almost nine years, reflecting high stress in money markets. Shunning all but the safest paper backed by the full faith of the U.S. government, investors scrambled for the shelter of Treasury bills. That stampede sent the yield on the U.S. 3-month T-bill briefly down close to zero, nudging the lowest level since 1940, according to Global Financial Data. "Banks are just pulling back and not lending and not being able to get the funding they need," said Sean Murphy, Treasuries trader at RBC Capital Markets in New York. There's "a flight to quality into the Treasury bill market," Murphy said. "People are just panicking and they just want their principal," he added. Overnight interbank rates came off Tuesday's seven-year peaks but remained elevated, with the premium paid for three-month funds rising as banks continued to struggle to raise short-term funds. The U.S. Federal Reserve's $85 billion rescue of insurer American International group ( AIG.N ) late on Tuesday might have helped soothe some of the more acute concerns surrounding the global financial system, but proved to be no panacea. London interbank offered rates for three-month dollars jumped 18 basis points to 3.0625 percent, their highest since late February. Three-month Libor euro and sterling rates also rose, with analysts saying there was unlikely to have been much, if any, lending over periods that far out. But Libor rates for overnight dollars as fixed by the British Bankers Association -- against which trillions of dollars of derivative, financial and corporate contracts are referenced -- fell to 5.03125 percent compared with 6.43750 percent on Tuesday. There were some signs of relief in that rates were not as high as Tuesday's extraordinary peaks above 10 percent and market participants said liquidity was flowing through the system a little more easily than Tuesday. But conditions remain strained. Three-month borrowing rates for U.S.-based banks jumped some 39 basis points to 3.36 percent on Wednesday, according to ICAP's New York Funding Rate, the biggest daily rise since NYFR's introduction in early June. "After the AIG loan package the strains that have been evident in the overnight market earlier in the week moved out the curve with a vengeance," said Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP in Jersey City, New Jersey. Federal funds in the U.S. overnight interbank market traded at 3.5 percent, well above the Fed's target rate, which it kept on hold at 2 percent on Tuesday, surprising some who had bet on an official rate cut. Overnight dollar fund rates were indicated as high as 8 percent earlier in the European session, according to prices on Reuters screens, before easing back to around 3 percent USDOND= later in the session. Activity was still being carried out on a discreet basis, with no benchmark pricing and banks dealing with counterparties only on an ad-hoc basis. Banks able to lend out short-term funds continued to stockpile cash, concerned that some borrowers might be unable to repay. "Counterparty risk remains the chief preoccupation for all intermediaries," said Ciaran O'Hagan, strategist at Societe Generale in Paris. "Tensions remain very, very high. There's no reason for (interbank) rates to fall." "BREAKING THE BUCK" Reserve Primary Fund, a U.S. money market mutual fund whose assets have tumbled 65 percent in recent weeks, fell below $1 a share in net asset value on Tuesday -- "breaking the buck" -- owing to losses on debt issued by Lehman Brothers LEH.N. "To let a fund break the buck, it's usually a death knell for the company itself," said David Riley, director of portfolio strategist at Rydex Investments at Rockville, Maryland. "When the $1 value of money funds is questioned, that's as scary as it gets," he said. Despite the U.S. authorities' action on AIG, strife in the banking system was all too evident. Shares of Wall Street firms plunged, with Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) down as much as 43 percent and Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) down as much as 27 percent. Shares in UK bank HBOS Plc HBOS.L plunged up to 50 percent at one point on Wednesday before they rebounded as it said it was in advanced merger talks with Lloyds TSB ( LLOY.L ). After the U.S. markets closed, British media reported that Lloyds had reached an agreement to take over HBOS in an all-share deal. The premium paid for three-month dollar Libor over anticipated central bank policy rates, according to Overnight Index Swaps, expanded by more than four basis points to 120.75 basis points to the widest since the crisis hit financial markets in August last year. The increase in premium was not confined to dollars. The three-month sterling Libor/OIS spread widened by almost six basis points to 93.625 basis points. One source said overnight dollar funds swung wildly between 1 and 20 percent throughout Tuesday. The Fed had added some $70 billion of funds to the banking system for the second day running on Tuesday in an effort to drag overnight lending rates back down to target during U.S. hours. On Wednesday, the U.S. Treasury Department said it would begin auctioning Treasury bills at the Federal Reserve's request under a special program to help the U.S. central bank manage its balance sheet. The Treasury then sold $40 billion of cash management bills at a high rate of 0.30 percent, with a bid-to-cover ratio, a gauge of demand, of 2.45. The Swiss National Bank offered "tomorrow-next" money on Wednesday to the money markets, traders said, after the central bank did not renew its overnight funding offer in the regular daily repo announcement. The Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of England and Bank of Japan all pumped funds into their money markets earlier in the week. The Fed has been generous in pumping funds into the system but dollars in European money markets remained in tight supply, said Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec in London. Analysts said part of the problem remains the paralysis of foreign exchange swaps markets, which means European financial institutions cannot get the dollars they need in European trading hours to meet their dollar funding requirements and cover their dollar exposures and liabilities. "It's getting better as things progress, and rates are not as high as yesterday," said one source. "But liquidity will stay tight as we approach the end of the third quarter."
