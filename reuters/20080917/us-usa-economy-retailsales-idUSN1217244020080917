 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Total sales at U.S. retailers in August fell for a second month in a row, according to a government report on Friday that showed consumers were coming under increasing pressure amid rising prices. 

 U.S. August wholesale prices dropped by a bigger-than-expected 0.9 percent, the sharpest retreat in almost two years, the government said on Friday as a big decline in energy costs eased price pressures.  KEY POINTS:  RETAIL SALES * Sales dropped 0.3 percent in August to a seasonally adjusted $381.17 billion after a sharply revised 0.5 percent drop in July that previously was reported as only a 0.1 percent decline. * The August fall in sales was sharply contrary to forecasts by Wall Street analysts surveyed by Reuters who had expected a 0.2 percent sales increase. * Sales at motor vehicle dealers rose 1.9 percent in August -- the first increase since January -- after a 4.3 percent July drop. But August sales still were down 13.5 percent from a year earlier.  PPI * The Labor Department's Producer Price Index, which measures prices at the farm and factory gate, slid by the steepest amount since October 2006 after notching a 1.2 percent gain in July. Analysts polled by Reuters were expecting a 0.5 percent decline. * Core prices, which strip out volatile food and energy costs, rose 0.2 percent as expected after a 0.7 percent surge in July that had fanned inflation fears. Energy goods prices tumbled 4.6 percent last month, the biggest drop since September 2006.  COMMENTS:  NIGEL GAULT, CHIEF U.S. ECONOMIST, GLOBAL INSIGHT, LEXINGTON,  MASSACHUSETTS: "The retail sales numbers are clearly very weak, weaker than people had expected... "Aside from hurricanes, the gasoline news has been getting better and as long as natural gas prices stay down, we'll get some relief on the residential gas side. But we have to put the PPI numbers in the context of what went before... "The PPI indicates that people are going to get some relief relative to the extreme hikes that energy prices have reached. We're reversing some of the increase, but we're not going to make those prices low... "Will lower energy prices make everything all right (for the consumer)? No. Will they help stop making things much, much worse? Yes, clearly. "But it's on its own, it's not enough to turn the consumer around."  JIM FEHRENBACH, HEAD OF NASDAQ TRADING, PIPER JAFFRAY,  MINNEAPOLIS: "I'm not surprised that retail sales came in lower. I don't see a reason why they will markedly improve in the future." "I expect it (the stock market) to open weaker but I don't expect it to careen lower all day. I expect it will find some level of stability. We are beginning to see fatigue on the seller side."  LOU BRIEN, MARKET STRATEGIST, DRW TRADING GROUP, CHICAGO: "Retail sales were much weaker than expected and the weakness was spread throughout several sectors, but the sales ex-gasoline were unchanged on the month, suggesting that much of the decline was from a drop in gasoline prices." "But it should also be said that on a year over year basis headline sales are now negative."  CHRIS RUPKEY, SENIOR FINANCIAL ECONOMIST, BANK OF  TOKYO-MITSUBISHI UFJ, NEW YORK: RETAIL SALES: "It pretty much sounds the death knell for the consumer here. Real consumer spending was negative in July and retail sales are now down ex-autos in August. It looks like consumer spending is retrenching, not only retrenching but digging a new hole. I would be very surprised to see consumer spending in positive territory in the third quarter." PPI: "Pressures are certainly subsiding but the problem with PPI is that even this data is running behind because crude oil prices have come off further since the first few weeks of August. So I think this report is more favorable than a month ago for core inflation pressures but the future is likely to be even better still simply because energy prices are on a new downward track. "It is certainly possible that there are some odds of a rate cut by the Fed in October but these data in and of themselves probably is not quite enough to get the Fed to move off the sidelines and into action. We will get some more consumer data for the month at the end of the month and we will see how that is. This is potentially new information though for the Fed if the consumer does retrench but still it is going to take some time for the momentum to change and for them to consider cutting rates. It is going to take some time for them to change gears."  STEPHEN MALYON, CHIEF CURRENCY STRATEGIST, SCOTIA CAPITAL,  TORONTO: "Today's disappointing U.S. retail sales figures appear to have prompted a resumption of U.S. dollar weakness although so far the currency's losses are very modest in the wake of the numbers. The PPI headline undershot expectations and we can expect to see further moderation given the decline in crude oil. Too much uncertainty with respect to what Lehman (Brothers) might announce later this morning is the reason we are not seeing too much reaction."
