 LONDON  (Reuters) - A potential merger deal between British bank Lloyds and mortgage lender HBOS could be finalized as early as Thursday, the BBC reported on Wednesday. 

 "I suspect that...we will get some kind of an announcement pretty quickly," the BBC's Business Editor Robert Peston said in a report on the merger talks. "I would imagine that a deal could be concluded...as early as tomorrow. These are very advanced talks". (Reporting by  Kate Kelland )
