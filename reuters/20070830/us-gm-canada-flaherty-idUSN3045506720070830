 CALGARY, Alberta  (Reuters) - The decision by General Motors of Canada ( GM.N ) to cut about 1,100 jobs at a truck plant in Ontario reflects a weak U.S. market, Canadian Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said on Thursday. 

 "This particular product, the larger pickup trucks ... are used a lot by entrepreneurs in the construction business and so on, so that's a weak market right now," he told reporters in Calgary. "The American market has been weak on the auto side, the Canadian market has been stronger, so this is regrettable."
