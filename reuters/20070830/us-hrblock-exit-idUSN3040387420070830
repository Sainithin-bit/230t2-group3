 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The timing for H&R Block Inc's ( HRB.N ) plan to exit the subprime mortgage business is fluid, and the company hopes to know by year-end whether its deal to sell the operations to Cerberus Capital Management LP will go through as planned, H&R Block's chief executive said. 

 Speaking on a conference call, H&R Block CEO Mark Ernst said H&R Block intends to exit the mortgage business, in response to a question about whether the company intends to be "out of mortgage" by December 31 should the Cerberus deal fall through. "When and exactly how that would happen I guess is fairly fluid at the moment and ... by December 31 we will know what happens with the Cerberus contract one way or the other," Ernst said.
