 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The number of U.S. workers filing new claims for jobless aid unexpectedly rose 9,000 last week, government data on Thursday showed. 

 Initial filings for state unemployment rose to 334,000 for the week ended August 25 from an upwardly revised 325,000 the prior week, the Labor Department said. Analysts on Wall Street had expected claims to measure 322,000 last week. The number of unemployed people still on the benefit rolls after drawing an initial week of aid was the highest since mid-April. The number of so-called continued claims rose 13,000 to 2.579 million in the week ended August 18, the latest period for which these figures were available. It had been expected to come in at 2.580 million.
