 (Reuters) - Mattel Inc, the world's largest toy company, has only itself to blame for a huge recall of made-in-China toys, the ruling Communist Party's official paper the People's Daily said on Thursday. 

 Here is a timeline charting some key moments since the toy recall saga began in early August: * August 2: Mattel recalls 1.5 million toys made in China for its Fisher-Price unit, including popular Sesame Street characters like Big Bird and Elmo, due to fears about lead paint. Mattel estimates the recall will cost it $30 million. * August 9: China cancels the export licenses of two Guangdong-based factories linked to recalls, Hansheng Wooden Products Factory and Lida Toy Company. * August 13: The boss of Lida Toy Company, Zhang Shuhong, is found dead in his factory workshop. Local media reports say he hanged himself. * August 14: Mattel recalls more than 18 million Chinese-made toys globally, because of hazards from magnets. It is the company's largest recall since 1998. * August 21: The U.S.-based China Labor Watch reports "brutal conditions" and labor violations at eight Chinese toy plants. Corner-cutting by multinational's sub-contractors is highlighted as one cause of substandard production. * August 27: The head of China's quality watchdog hits back at critics, saying defective designs, differing national standards and lack of communication have fed a politically motivated storm surrounding Chinese-made goods. * August 28: A U.S. Senate Committee launches an investigation into American safety standards for childrens' clothing and toys. The committee says it will examine whether new legislation is necessary to protect children from hazardous toys. * August 30: Chinese state media says that Mattel must bear some blame for the huge toy recall, and charges that a slew of foreign scares about made-in-China goods reveal a protectionist agenda.
