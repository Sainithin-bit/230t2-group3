 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - A U.S. federal judge declined on Wednesday to overturn the conviction against the former chief executive of Brocade Communications ( BRCD.O ) on stock options backdating charges. 

 A federal court jury in San Francisco earlier this month found former Brocade CEO Gregory Reyes, 44, guilty of 10 counts, including conspiracy to commit securities fraud, mail fraud, falsifying books, records and accounts, and making false statements. His lawyers asked Judge Charles Breyer to overturn the jury's finding and order a new trial. "The Court holds that none of the events of the trial -- the evidence presented, the Court's curative jury instructions, or the prosecution's closing arguments -- constitute a 'miscarriage of justice,'" Breyer wrote in response. "It is beyond dispute that a backdating scheme existed at Brocade. It is also basically undisputed that Reyes knew about the backdating. And so the factfinder is left to wonder why the scheme existed at all. The most plausible answer is to hide expenses." Legal experts have said the conviction on all counts could embolden prosecutors and regulators in pursuing of other backdating cases. More than 170 U.S. companies have been impacted by scandals over whether their officials retroactively priced option grants on days when a stock was low, maximizing gains for employees.
