 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A federal judge in Rhode Island has denied a U.S. government request for tax documents belonging to diversified manufacturer Textron Inc ( TXT.N ), according to court documents. 

 The U.S. government had filed a petition to enforce an Internal Revenue Service summons seeking Textron's "tax accrual work papers" for its 2001 tax year, according to court documents. The court denied the petition, saying the requested documents are protected by the "work product privilege," according to a ruling issued by U.S. District Judge Ernest Torres on Wednesday.
