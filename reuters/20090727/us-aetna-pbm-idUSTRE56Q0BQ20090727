 (Reuters) - Health insurer Aetna Inc ( AET.N ) is looking to sell its pharmacy benefits management (PBM) business, the Wall Street Journal said, citing several people familiar with the matter. 

 Bankers at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch and Credit Suisse have been shopping around the business, the people told the paper. The people identified CVS Caremark Corp ( CVS.N ) and Medco Health Solutions Inc MHS.N as potential buyers, the paper said. The paper said Aetna's PBM business was also shopped to Express Scripts Inc ( ESRX.O ) which bought WellPoint Inc.'s ( WLP.N ) NextRx pharmacy benefits business for $4.68 billion in April. Aetna could not be immediately reached for comment by Reuters outside regular office hours. (Reporting by  Ajay Kamalakaran  in Bangalore; Editing by  Anshuman Daga )
