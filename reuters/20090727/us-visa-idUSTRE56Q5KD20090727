 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Visa Inc ( V.N ), the world's largest credit card network, announced a management reorganization on Monday that includes the departure of its president, even as it said performance is meeting or exceeds its forecast. 

 The San Francisco-based company said John "Hans" Morris will step down as president, but remain with Visa in a different capacity until year end. Visa said it will also consolidate oversight of its sales, client service, marketing, product development and "innovation" functions under Chief Operating Officer John Partridge. Morris joined Visa in 2007, when he was 48, and according to the company "played a central role" in its March 2008 initial public offering, when it raised about $19.7 billion. Before joining Visa, Morris had worked at Citigroup Inc ( C.N ) and its predecessors. Visa said the management changes will "heighten organizational effectiveness and increase the pace of Visa's global alignment." The company did not give a reason for Morris' departure. Visa spokesman Paul Cohen declined to elaborate, citing a quiet period ahead of the company's expected reporting of fiscal third-quarter results on Wednesday. Chief Executive Joseph Saunders also said Visa continues, "to meet or exceed all our current financial guidance." Analysts on average expect quarterly profit of 65 cents per share on revenue of $1.64 billion, Reuters Estimates said. Visa's main rival is MasterCard Inc ( MA.N ), which is scheduled to report quarterly results on Thursday. Visa shares rose 25 cents to $68.44 in after-hours trading. They had risen 90 cents to $68.19 in regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel; editing by Carol Bishopric and  Andre Grenon )
