 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Sales of new single-family homes in the United States rose more than expected in June. 

 KEY POINTS: * Sales rose to an annual rate of 384,000 in June, the Commerce Department reported, up 11 percent from May. * Housing inventory fell to 8.8 months of supply, compared with 9.6 months a year ago. * The rise in sales and the declining inventory is another indication the housing sector, which led the United States into the current recession, may have hit bottom and is starting to rebound. * Despite the encouraging data, the median sale price for a new home fell to $206,200, down 5.8 percent of the previous month, and down 12 percent from a year ago. COMMENTS: DAVID DIETZE, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, POINT VIEW FINANCIAL SERVICES, SUMMIT, NEW JERSEY: "There's a couple of factors. One, improving sentiment. There's nothing like some return to normalcy in the credit markets plus a raging bull market since March to boost sentiment among the home-buying population. The other thing of course is that there's been pent-up demand. New family formation and depreciation of the existing housing stock does not abate during periods of economic crisis. So you've also got a situation where there's been a lot of would-be buyers on the sidelines and that group has been growing, waiting for some sort of sign that the economy is not going to fall through the floor. "We're seeing some of those buyers get up off the bench and take advantage of the opportunities. The other thing is that affordability is now at levels not seen for a generation, when you factor in lower prices being sought by home-builders with far more reasonable mortgage rates relative to incomes. Affordability is also making it possible for people to step up and get active. "It's excellent news, but remember, it's just one month, it's not all of real estate, it doesn't include residential preexisting home stock, you're coming off very weak numbers so yes it's a nice edge up but from hopefully trough levels. It's still not at an annualized rate that signals that the unpleasantness is over with, but certainly it's a clear step in the right direction. Obviously we're also looking at the level of housing starts as an indicator for what sales might look like in the months to come, so you don't want to say that we're definitively out of recession by virtue of this one data point." SCOTT BROWN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, RAYMOND JAMES & ASSOCIATES, ST PETERSBURG, FLORIDA: "I take the numbers with a grain of salt but at face value they are encouraging. "Certainly it's a big surprise. These (home sales) numbers tend to be pretty choppy and subject to large revisions, but taken at face value it will be encouraging to the stock market and a big negative for government bonds. "Home sales may tend to bunch up in response to mortgage rates. We need to see what happens next month. "Prices are still coming down in a lot of areas." T.J. MARTA, FOUNDER AND MARKET STRATEGIST, MARTA ON THE MARKETS, SCOTCH PLAINS, NEW JERSEY: "The new homes market is clearing. These are huge percentage increases. Housing has become more affordable, not only because of the fall in prices, but mortgage rates have been pinned down by the Fed. It's certainly a positive development. When you compare the 11 percent jump in June new home sales to the 3.6 percent jump in June sales of existing homes reported on Thursday, the particular spike in new home sales might have to do with corporate pressures to unload inventory." STEPHEN MASSOCCA, MANAGING DIRECTOR, WEDBUSH MORGAN IN SAN FRANCISCO "It was better-than-expected. It's probably more of what this market needs to keep rolling along -- it's more good news. This is more sauce for the goose here. This is going to keep things going. There's a lot of liquidity out there. They've flooded the world with dollars, they've flooded the world with currency - it has to go somewhere." JACOB OUBINA, CURRENCY STRATEGIST, FOREX.COM, BEDMINSTER, NEW JERSEY: "Stocks had a delayed reaction but have now blasted into positive terrain, and we're seeing commensurate gains in the yen crosses and in euro/dollar. It's more good news and follows the good German confidence report. So while the data continues to come in better-than-expected, you're going to see this risk rally continue. It's going to take some pretty ugly earnings reports or a downturn in economic data to turn this around. I'd expect the euro/dollar high around 1.4337 to be the next resistance level if this euphoric rally continues." GARY SHILLING, PRESIDENT, A. GARY SHILLING & CO., SPRINGFIELD, NEW JERSEY: "I think the housing sector is still weak. Basic problem is there is a huge excess inventory and that continually depresses prices. Obviously prices are down. Case Shiller quarterly index will probably be down 10-15 percent from here before it's over. But there is still a lot of pressure because of excess houses. New home sales are going to be very limited whether they in a bottoming process or not remains to be seen. When you have got that excess inventory then there is no great zeal to build more houses." JIM AWAD, MANAGING DIRECTOR AT ZEPHYR MANAGEMENT IN NEW YORK "The data will reinforce the developing thinking that housing market has bottomed and that economy has stabilized and will grow in the third quarter. In the cocktail of the market, it will be viewed positively and will add credence to the bulls, who think we will have a rebound in the markets going forward." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stock indexes rallied. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices added to losses. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar rose against the yen, fell against the euro.
