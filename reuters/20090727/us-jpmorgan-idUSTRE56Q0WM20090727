 (Reuters) - JP Morgan Chase & Co revamped some of its senior equities staff looking to gear the bank for more push into prime brokerage, the Wall Street Journal said, citing people familiar with the matter. 

 As a result of the rejig, Richard Berliand, formerly the global head of cash equities and prime services will now focus on the bank's prime business, the paper said. David Long, who headed equity derivatives for the Americas, will now be global co-head of cash equities, along with Jim Brett, former head of cash equities for the Americas. The paper also citied sources saying Lee Cook, who was head of equities for Europe, Middle East and Africa, has quit. JP Morgan did not immediately reply to an email seeking comments, sent outside regular business hours. A company spokeswoman verified the changes with the paper.
