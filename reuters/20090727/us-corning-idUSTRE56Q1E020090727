 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Specialty glass maker Corning Inc ( GLW.N ) on Monday posted better-than-expected quarterly revenue, fueled by improved demand for glass for flat-screen television. 

 Corning, whose glass is used for flat-panel displays and fiber-optic cables, said second-quarter net income fell to $611 million, or 39 cents a share, from $782 million, or 49 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts were looking for profit of 32 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. It was not immediately clear whether the figures were comparable. Revenue in the quarter was $1.4 billion, off from $1.69 billion a year earlier, but better than the $1.36 billion that analysts had expected, according to Reuters Estimates.
