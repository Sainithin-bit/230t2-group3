 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Foreign central banks' overall holdings of U.S. marketable securities at the Federal Reserve fell in the latest week, data from the U.S. central bank showed on Thursday. 

 The Fed said its holdings of U.S. securities kept for overseas central banks fell $20.272 billion in the week ended May 26 to stand at $3.429 trillion. The breakdown of custody holdings showed overseas central banks' holdings of Treasury debt declined by $18.683 billion to stand at $2.704 trillion. Foreign institutions' holdings of securities issued or guaranteed by the biggest U.S. mortgage financing agencies, including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, fell by $1.588 billion to stand at $743.419 billion. Overseas central banks, particularly those in Asia, have been huge buyers of U.S. debt in recent years, and own over a quarter of marketable Treasuries. China and Japan are the biggest two foreign holders of Treasuries. The full Fed report can be found on:  here (Reporting by  Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss ; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
