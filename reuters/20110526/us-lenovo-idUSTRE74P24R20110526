 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Lenovo Group Ltd, the world's No. 4 PC brand, is facing a supply shortage on its LePad tablet device, its chief executive said on Thursday. 

 It is also aiming for a market share of more than 20 percent in China's tablet PC market, Lenovo's Chief Executive Yang Yuanqing told reporters after the release of its January-March earnings that beat market expectations. Lenovo launched the LePad tablet PC in China in March this year. (Reporting by Lee Chyen Yee; Editing by Jacqueline Wong)
