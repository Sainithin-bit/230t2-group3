 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ) shareholders mingled with protestors as they gathered in Frankfurt for the lenders annual general meeting. 

 The flagship lender, which faces a leadership vacuum and a raft of legal issues tied to its role during the financial crisis, ignored whistling protestors pacing up and down the Frankfurt fair and exhibition center and instead attempted to underline the bank's achievements. Chief Executive Josef Ackermann did not blink as a protestor attempted to interrupt his speech with a tin whistle and instead waited for a raft of burly security staff to evict the interloper before carrying on with his speech. Ackermann briefly paused before underlining the bank's milestone acquisitions that helped the lender achieve near record earnings in the first quarter and emphasized he would fight a raft of lawsuits that have recently hit the bank. "Where we believe we are being attacked unjustly, we will defend ourselves vigorously," he said. "Allow me however to add something here: In an organization of over 100,000 people in more than 70 countries around the world, breaches of these principles cannot be eliminated once and for all." Shareholder Simone Lennerz, a bespectacled protestor clad in a cream-colored summer dress from an organization called Urgewalt, was unimpressed. She said she wanted to highlight the fact that Deutsche Bank had helped finance Tepco ( 9501.T ), the operator of the Japanese nuclear power plant at Fukushima, and would seek to make her voice heard. She stood near Willi van Ooyen, a member of the Left party in the state of Hessen, who was campaigning for "better control of the banks, to get to a new global financial culture which is not so focused on profits, and financing weapons and wars." Meanwhile, legal problems are piling up for the bank. This week, it emerged that New York's attorney general has sought information from Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ), UBS AG ( UBS.N ) and others as part of a probe into mortgage operations. The U.S. government sued Deutsche Bank for more than $1 billion, accusing the German bank of fraud for repeatedly lying to obtain federal guarantees on mortgages it issued. Deutsche Bank has dismissed the lawsuits as being without merit. Deutsche Bank's supervisory board chairman Clemens Boersig did not provide any guidance on progress finding a successor for Ackermann, beyond reiterating the bank was following an "orderly process" that any developments will be communicated at the "appropriate time."
