 ZURICH  (Reuters) - Swiss bank UBS ( UBS.N )( UBSN.VX ) is committed to its integrated business model, including its investment bank. 

 The bank made the comment after the Wall Street Journal reported that it was planning to move its investment bank from Switzerland, which UBS called "speculation." (Reporting by Albert Schmieder)
