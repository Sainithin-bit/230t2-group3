 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Sony Corp said on Thursday it still aims to restore its PlayStation network in full by the end of May, adding that if it is later it would only be by a few days. 

 The consumer electronics company is reeling from one of the biggest ever Internet security breaches, which forced it to close its PlayStation videogames network for nearly a month after data on tens of millions of user accounts was leaked. (Reporting by  Isabel Reynolds )
