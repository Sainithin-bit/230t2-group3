 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - New orders for long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods fell more than expected in April to record their largest decline in six months as aircraft and motor vehicle orders tumbled, a government report showed on Wednesday. 

 KEY POINTS: * The Commerce Department said durable goods orders dropped 3.6 percent after an upwardly revised 4.4 percent rise in March, which was previously reported as a 4.1 percent increase. * Economists polled by Reuters had expected orders to decline 2.2 percent last month. COMMENTS: CARY LEAHEY, SENIOR ECONOMIST AND MANAGING DIRECTOR, DECISION ECONOMICS, NEW YORK: "The report is disappointing. Any optimism one gleaned from last month's report was kind of squashed in the latest report for April. "Unfortunately, core durable goods orders have done very little since late summer 2010, stuck at around $64 or $65 billion, about 30 percent of the total. This is the so-called non-defense capital goods ex-aircraft category which is seen as a proxy for business sending. "The April level is about where it was in the first quarter so it suggests that firms' capital spending inclinations are pretty flat or sluggish in the second quarter. "For better or for worse, firms are slowly adding to their payrolls, but since they think underlying demand growth is still very sluggish, they don't feel any hurry to do much of anything in terms of capital investment, particularly since the average firm is already making so much money with a lot fewer workers. The worry is that whatever capital spending occurs in the next year, a lot of it will substitute for new hiring. "We have a pretty anemic bounce-back forecast for the second quarter to about 2.5 percent. Anything under 3 percent is pretty anemic." AICHI AMEMIYA, ECONOMIST, NOMURA SECURITIES INTERNATIONAL, NEW YORK: "It's a huge drop, but it's part due to a fall in orders in aircraft. On the positive side, there is an upward revision to the prior month. So overall, we don't think the report will have a major negative impact on Q2 GDP. After the upward revisions, based on our model, we expect the Q1 GDP would be revised up to about 2.3 percent." FRED DICKSON, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, D.A. DAVIDSON & CO., LAKE OSWEGO, OREGON: "All over the place, slightly disappointing but it's a very volatile number. The key piece was that Boeing had 98 orders for aircraft last month, this month it had 2. So it's hard to draw any meaningful conclusion. You need about 3 or 4 months of data to draw something meaningful out of it. It's another modestly disappointing data point in a long series of slightly disappointing data points that we've gotten in the last month. Not indicative of an economic downturn, just kind of paints a picture that the economy is in a momentary lull." OMER ESINER, CHIEF MARKET ANALYST, COMMONWEALTH FOREIGN EXCHANGE, WASHINGTON: "I guess there's no positive way to spin these numbers. The headline number is down sharply in April. I like to look at the key gauge of business spending --- non-defense capital orders ex-aircraft -- (which) is down more than 2 percent. It's consistent with overall negative tone of these numbers. It's in line with some weaker global data lately and as such is a negative for risk appetite -- for equities, commodities, high-yield currencies -- and will likely lend some modest support to the dollar. Earlier this year, markets were overly optimistic, which you could see in the earlier price action in commodities and equities. So as those come off the boil, it represents a more balanced outlook." GARY THAYER, CHIEF MACRO STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO ADVISORS, ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI: "Durable goods orders were weaker than expected, but we had a good month in March and it appears that a lot of the weakness was in transportation, particularly aircraft orders. Weakness in vehicles and parts was probably related to the Japanese supply disruptions. Overall, it's still probably a weak number this quarter for the economy, but not suggesting a new recession or anything like that." TOM PORCELLI, U.S. ECONOMIST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, NEW YORK: "It's pretty much weakness across the board. Fortunately other data suggests that manufacturing activity should hold up, particularly ISM, but we are starting off the quarter on a softer tone. "There has already been talk (in the Treasury market) of more weakness in the data and I think that this will just fuel that talk."
