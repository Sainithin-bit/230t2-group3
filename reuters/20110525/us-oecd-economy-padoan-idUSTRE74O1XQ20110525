 PARIS  (Reuters) - Major economies are strong enough to begin tackling debts that exploded during the 2008-09 economic crisis, OECD chief economist Pier Carlo Padoan said. 

 Padoan told Reuters Insider TV that growth was not only firm enough to withstand tightening but that the 34 countries belonging to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development needed to start to keep debt from becoming a drag on growth. "Debt accumulation has been rising as we know very very rapidly," he said on the sidelines of a forum at the OECD in Paris. "While in the short term there is a cost in terms of fiscal consolidation, there are big benefits in the medium term, both in terms of market response and especially (because) higher debt means lower growth," he added. The OECD said in a report on Wednesday that debt levels had reached an average just above 100 percent of output, compared with an average of 70 percent before the crisis. Padoan said that debt levels greater than 75-80 percent of output become a brake on growth, which in turn can drive debt even higher. "Many countries are already beyond that and that is the worrying situation that we face." Turning to the euro zone's debt crisis, he said that "certainly more needs to be done in the periphery" countries such as Greece, Ireland and Portugal struggle to get to grips with their debts.
