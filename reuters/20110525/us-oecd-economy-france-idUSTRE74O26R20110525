 PARIS  (Reuters) - France's economy is on track to grow by just over 2 percent in 2011 and 2012 despite a progressive reduction in the budget deficit, though unemployment will remain stubbornly high, the OECD said on Wednesday. 

 In its twice-yearly Economic Outlook, the Paris-based organization also said spare capacity in the euro zone's second largest economy would limit second-round inflationary pressures, with headline inflation easing to 1.6 percent in 2012. Growth of France's 2 trillion euro economy would rise to 2.2 percent this year, from 1.4 percent in 2010, and ease slightly to 2.1 percent in 2012. The forecast was slightly more optimistic than an estimate the OECD made last month for growth this year of 2.0 percent. With French households holding relatively modest net debt levels, there was no need for the deleveraging seen in some other European economies, and consumer spending would remain supportive of growth. There were also signs that business investment is recovering. Unemployment in France would decline toward 9 percent by the end of next year. It is currently stuck at around 9.6 percent. "On the other hand, debt restructuring in EU peripheral countries could prolong turmoil in sovereign bond markets, harming French banks, which are highly exposed to those markets," the OECD said. While France's public finances are in poor shape, steps to reduce its fiscal deficit were appropriate, the OECD said. France plans to cut its deficit from 7 percent in 2010 to 4.6 percent of GDP by 2012 and 2 percent of GDP by 2014. "Beyond 2014, the more ambitious objective of eliminating the deficit entirely is called for in order to bring down debt at an appropriate pace," the report said. The OECD urged France to push ahead with a constitutional deficit rule and to focus on supply side reforms aimed at improving competitiveness. It repeated a warning that low interest rates risked leading to a housing bubble. (Reporting by  Daniel Flynn ; Editing by Mike Peacock)
