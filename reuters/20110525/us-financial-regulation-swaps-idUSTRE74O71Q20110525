 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The United States is far ahead of Europe in bringing the $600 trillion swaps market under regulation, which could drive trading overseas, one of the five commissioners who oversee the U.S. futures markets said on Wednesday. 

 Besides the timeline, Commissioner Jill Sommers of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said there are significant differences in the impact of rules being drafted in the European Union and the United States, the biggest swaps markets. "I believe a material difference in the timing of rule implementation is likely to occur, which may shift business overseas as the cost of doing business in the United States increases and create other opportunities for regulatory arbitrage," said Sommers at a House subcommittee hearing. Sommers told reporters the EU may not complete its rules until late 2012 or into 2013. CFTC chairman Gary Gensler wants to adopt financial reform rules by the end of this year, with implementation in following months. "There is no doubt we will be in front of other jurisdictions," said Sommers. With a phased implementation of U.S. rules, the gap could be short, said Bart Chilton, another CFTC commissioner. "We're not talking a year delay," he said, adding "I agree we need to be deliberate on this" and coordinate with other regulators. Leaders of the Group of 20 large industrialized nations have a goal of regulating over-the-counter derivatives by the end of 2012. In general, they want OTC derivatives to go through clearinghouses and trade on regulated arenas as much as possible, with all deals being reported and larger cash reserves required when swaps are not cleared. Sommers said EU rules may differ from U.S. proposals by exempting pension funds from mandatory clearing and by requiring one quote, rather than five, when a swap is traded. The EU has yet to unveil proposals on issues such as capital and margin requirements for uncleared swaps, she said. Two financial trade groups, the Financial Industry Association and the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, after saying they were concerned by potential differences in U.S. and EU rules, suggested CFTC should allow a new round of comment once its array of rules are final. "We think a 60-day comment period would be well within the timetable set by the G20," said FIA chief John Damgard. Sommers and Chilton said a 15 percent funding cut proposed by lawmakers for the new fiscal year would cripple CFTC's ability to enforce its rules on swaps.
