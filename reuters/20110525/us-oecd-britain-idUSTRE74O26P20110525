 LONDON  (Reuters) - The Bank of England should raise interest rates this year to prevent persistently above-target inflation from embedding expectations of higher prices, the OECD said on Wednesday. 

 In its semi-annual report on the global economy, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said it expected British inflation to remain above 4 percent this year -- double the BoE's target -- but to return to around 2 percent in 2012. "Monetary policy remains highly expansionary," the OECD said. "This is appropriate as inflation is expected to fall in 2012. "Nevertheless, a modest increase in interest rates should be taken during 2011 to stave off increases in inflation expectations, which are already elevated." The BoE has held interest rates at a record low 0.5 percent for more than two years, with the majority of its policymakers concerned that economic recovery is too fragile to withstand any tightening, even though inflation remains high. Money markets are not pricing in a first quarter-point rise in rates until early next year after a raft of subdued economic data. The OECD recommended that the BoE should step up the pace of "normalization" of interest rates next year, but should not start unwinding its 200 billion pounds ($322 billion) of quantitative easing asset purchases until after 2012. The BoE has said it would not start selling back its QE gilt purchases until it has started raising interest rates. GROWTH SLUGGISH The OECD said it expected growth to remain slow this year, partly as a consequence of public spending cuts, and revised down its forecast for GDP growth to 1.4 percent from 1.5 percent in March. It saw a modest pick-up to 1.8 percent in 2012. The UK government's Office for Budget Responsibility has forecast growth of 1.7 percent for this year and 2.5 for 2012. The OECD praised the government's austerity measures to eliminate its budget deficit over the next four years, saying they "strike the right balance," but said the cuts should be implemented in a way that minimized the detrimental impact on short-term growth. It also recommended raising the retirement age for Britons and improving public sector efficiency as ways of easing long-term pressures on public finances.
