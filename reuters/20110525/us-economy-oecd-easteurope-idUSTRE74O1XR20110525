 PRAGUE  (Reuters) - The OECD lifted its 2011 growth forecast Israel on Wednesday and said the outlook for central Europe's fastest-growing economy, Poland, remained strong. 

 The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development also said domestic demand would pick up in the Czech Republic and Hungary even as fiscal consolidation holds back growth. In a regular report, the group said a rise in Polish inflation called for monetary tightening and that more rate hikes in Israel were needed to stem inflationary pressures. Following are the main points from the OECD Economic Outlook report on its member countries, including Israel and ex-communist European Union states. POLAND Poland is seen growing nearly 4 percent in 2011 and 2012 due to investment this year connected to EU-financed infrastructure projects and 2012 Euro football championship preparations. The OECD also sees robust private consumption and a recovery in business investment in 2012. It said a sharp rise in headline inflation mainly due to food and energy price growth so far this year may translate into wage increases, and that this called for monetary tightening. "Any delay in monetary tightening would result in stronger domestic demand and higher inflation," the OECD report said. On the fiscal side, economic growth will help cut the budget deficit to 3.7 percent by 2012, from 7.9 percent last year. Diverting some contributions from the second pension pillar to the first pillar will also reduce the deficit in both years. "Further measures are needed if the government is to achieve its deficit goal of 2.9 percent of GDP in 2012," the OECD said, adding a proposal to introduce deficit and debt limits for local authorities would be a step in the right direction. It said there was a risk that if fiscal tightening measures were not taken due to parliamentary elections later this year, the deficit could be higher than projected. HUNGARY The OECD sees Hungary's economic growth picking up to 2.7 percent in 2011 and 3.1 percent in 2012, supported by exports and an improvement in domestic demand, although fiscal consolidation would restrain pace of the expansion. It said the center-right government's reform program unveiled earlier this year was a step in the right direction. "Implementing credible structural measures to consolidate public finances is the next necessary step to foster market confidence and pave the way to sound growth," the report said. The main risk would be a failure to follow through on fiscal consolidation and structural reform. While Hungary's cash budget deficit exceed its full-year target in the first quarter, the OECD said one-off revenue coming from the "dismantling" of the second pension pillar would create a 2011 surplus, before a return to deficit in 2012. The OECD said the pension liabilities taken on from the second pillar have deteriorated long-term fiscal sustainability. CZECH REPUBLIC The OECD expects the Czech economy to grow by 2.4 percent in 2011, mainly due to strong foreign demand. Growth should accelerate to 3.5 percent next year once consumption picks up. The center-right government's budget tightening will have a restraining effect this year, the OECD said. It said the state should continue with fiscal tightening to achieve medium-term targets and use the economic recovery to secure sustainability of the pension and healthcare systems. Czech headline inflation will spike temporarily in 2012 due to indirect tax increases, but core inflation will remain low. The OECD said monetary policy should normalize gradually as recovery takes hold. The key Czech interest rate is at a record low of 0.75 percent, 50 basis points below the euro zone's. ISRAEL The OECD expects Israel's economy to grow 5.4 percent in 2011 before slowing to 4.7 percent in 2012 due to rising labor-supply constraints and more interest rate hikes. In November, it had penciled in growth nearer four percent for this year. It said recent political developments in the region were a risk to the economy. The report also said fiscal goals would probably be achieved. Annual inflation will remain above the central bank's target band until the beginning of 2012, while underlying consumer price inflation is projected to edge up. To stem inflationary pressure, the OECD said the policy rate should rise to 4.75 percent this year, from 3.25 percent now, and by a further 75 basis points in 2012. It said increases may be smaller if the shekel firms but that partly depends on whether currency intervention continues. "The continued efforts to curb currency appreciation reflect a strategy that is less single-mindedly focused on hitting the inflation target," it said. The OECD said some of the currency measures were increasingly at odds with the pace of economic recovery and authorities should return to a "straightforward" policy if export growth looks strong.
