 DUBLN  (Reuters) - Ireland should not raise its low rate of corporate tax, a senior OECD official said on Wednesday. 

 "We don't think it should be increased because capital is mobile and can move to another country," Patrick Lenain told a fiscal conference in Dublin after the Paris-based OECD released its twice-yearly economic outlook. France has said Ireland should raise its 12.5 percent rate of corporate tax if it wants to get a cut in the cost of emergency EU loans. (Reporting by Carmel Crimmins; Editing by Ruth Pitchford)
