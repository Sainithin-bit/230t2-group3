 BERLIN  May 25 (Reuters) - Debt levels in Greece, Ireland and Portugal are unsustainable if market interest rates remain high for long and policy options for restoring the countries to a healthy fiscal path all carry big risks, the OECD said on Wednesday. 

 In its twice-yearly economic outlook, the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said the three countries faced formidable challenges even if they met targets set out for them in EU/IMF rescue packages. "Even if the governments are more or less on track to meet their fiscal targets, their fiscal positions would not be sustainable if market interest rates were to remain for long at their current level," the OECD said. It mapped out three policy options should market confidence not return, but also spelled out the risks associated with each path and stopped short of endorsing any of them. The first option was continued funding from the European Union and International Monetary Fund at interest rates well below those in the market. "However, if eventually any of these countries were unable to repay their debts at the interest rate on offer, such continued assistance would only have postponed the resolution of unsustainable positions," the OECD warned. While continued assistance could calm markets in the short term, the OECD said, it could also drive up debt yields if official loans were seen to have senior status. "Unless such senior assistance reduces the probability of default significantly, it thus translates into higher risk premia," the OECD said in the report. A second option would be to reschedule the existing debt stock, but this would have to be done over a "very extended period" and at low interest rates to restore fiscal sustainability. The third option would be reduce government liabilities through a more far-reaching debt restructuring. "In practice, however, the use of this option is severely circumscribed by the need to find adequate answers to three issues: how to avoid a breakdown of domestic financial sectors, which would have calamitous effects; how to address spillovers to other countries through the financial system; and how to prevent contagion effects from one country to others," the OECD said. A disorderly debt restructuring could spark contagion to the core of the euro area financial system, heightening risk aversion globally. "In this event, there could also be adverse fiscal effects in the core countries if further support for the banking system were required, and risks to the credibility of monetary policy, given likely large hits to the ECB balance sheet," the OECD said. For the euro zone as a whole, the OECD forecast a strengthening of the economic recovery this year but said underlying inflation pressures would remain low, making further interest rate hikes from the European Central Bank unnecessary. It predicted that economic growth in the 17 countries sharing the euro would be 2.0 percent this year and next, and that inflation would rise to 2.6 percent this year before falling back to 1.6 percent in 2012. "Provided that the recovery continues and that underlying inflationary pressures remain weak, monetary policy stimulus should be withdrawn only gradually, and further increases inpolicy rates are not required immediately," the OECD said. The European Central Bank raised interest rates for the first time in two years in April and is expected to tighten further in July.
