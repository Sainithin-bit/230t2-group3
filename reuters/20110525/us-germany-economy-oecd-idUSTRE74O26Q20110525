 BERLIN  (Reuters) - Germany will expand considerably faster than its long-term trend this year and next, as accommodative euro zone interest rates encourage an investment boom, a key report showed on Wednesday. In its Economic Outlook published twice yearly, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) projected growth would slow ever so slightly to 3.4 percent this year before dropping back to 2.5 percent in 2012, spurred mainly by businesses buying machinery and equipment to expand capacity. 

 "Growth will be boosted by the ECB monetary conditions, which are too loose given the rise in Germany's nominal gross domestic product," it wrote in the report. Add to this an increase in both construction as well as household consumption, and the economy will shrug off lower exports to speed past its trend growth rate estimated at around 1.5 percent, according to the OECD. On Tuesday, official German statistics showed GDP rose at a red-hot rate of 1.5 percent quarter-on-quarter in the first three months of this year, after notching up an annual rise of 3.5 percent for 2010. [ID:nLDE74N08M] The OECD added that historically high levels of business confidence suggests that "any adverse growth effects from the earthquake in Japan -- notably through supply chains -- will be limited." Although labor shortages are beginning to emerge in some sectors, it projected that German inflation as measured across the euro zone should peak at 2.6 percent this year before easing to 1.7 percent in 2012, The OECD cautioned though that this forecast assumes a drop in volatile food and energy prices, while core inflation would rise thanks to compensation per employee climbing about 3 percent next year, its highest rate since the mid-1990s. Germany's boom will help alleviate a continued deterioration in the government's balance sheet, a risk that the OECD say needs to be held in check in view of worsening demographics. "Financing this additional debt burden coupled with the rise in government bond yields (to 4 percent for 10-year Bunds next year) will raise interest expenditures by around 0.3 percent of GDP," the organization said.
