 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said on Wednesday that the country's economy was already showing signs of recovering from the slump that immediately followed the devastating March 11 earthquake. 

 Some companies are pushing forward their plans for repairing supply chain disruptions, and consumers seem less cautious about spending than they were immediately after the quake, Shirakawa told a seminar. "It might not be a V-shaped recovery but there is a good chance we will feel a stronger sense of a recovery in the latter half of the current business year," he said.

MONETARY POLICY "A typical example of how our asset-buying scheme has had an effect is the real estate investment trust (REIT) market. The scheme has had the effect of supporting and lifting asset prices. "We increased the size of the scheme after the earthquake and tsunami ... The corporate bond market, in particular, showed unstable moves after the disaster due partly to problems with the bonds issued by electric utilities. The BOJ's purchases have produced effects there. "As for the future, the current economic slump is basically due to supply constraints, namely, supply chain disruptions and power shortages... "Even if we ease policy, it would not change the fact that automakers are unable to make their products... "We are steadily buying assets under the asset-buying fund ... We will take action if it is deemed necessary or desirable." LOANS FOR GROWTH INDUSTRIES "The loan scheme for growth industries has played a role in helping develop the basis for Japan's economic growth ... It is one of the ways for the BOJ to make a contribution. "We are currently studying whether there is room to make better use of the scheme. As for reconstruction, it is likely to take time for full-fledged reconstruction so it is difficult to determine the timing for us to get involved. "Support for growth industries and reconstruction have some overlapping features but they are not the same issues. We would like to discuss how the two should position themselves in our policy from the next monetary policy meeting and beyond." ACCORD WITH GOVT "The U.S. Treasury had an accord with the central bank in 1951 and before that, the Federal Reserve needed to keep long-term rates at a certain level ... The accord was designed so that the central bank could carry out policy independent from the government ... "If the central bank is to conclude an accord with the government for tolerating monetization of government debt instead of ensuring stability of prices and the economy, this would have adverse effects."
