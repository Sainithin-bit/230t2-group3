 PARIS  (Reuters) - The United States will work to help Russia join the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a western-dominated forum for advanced market economies, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said on Wednesday. 

 She was speaking after Moscow signed an anti-bribery convention at OECD headquarters in Paris and became a member of an OECD Working Group on Bribery in International Business Transactions. "We are looking forward to working with Russia as it continues to (move) toward full OECD membership," Clinton said. "Meeting the high standards of the OECD will complement Russia's own goal of further modernizing and diversifying its economy-and at the same time, Russia will enrich the OECD's efforts to drive economic and development cooperation around the world." Russia is regarded as one of the most corrupt countries for doing business in the world, according to pressure group Transparency International's 2010 corruption perceptions index, which rated it 154th out of 178 countries.
