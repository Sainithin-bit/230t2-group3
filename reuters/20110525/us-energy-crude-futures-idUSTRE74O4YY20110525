 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Brent crude futures extended gains to $2 and U.S. crude to more than $1 on Wednesday, as a large drop in distillate stockpiles in the United States reported by the government sparked a heating oil futures rally. 

 ICE Brent July crude rose $2.01 to $114.54 a barrel by 11:40 a.m. EDT (1540 GMT), trading from $111.14 to $114.62. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the July crude contract rose $1.22 to $100.81 a barrel, trading from $98.20 to $100.93. Front-month June heating oil futures rose 6.41 cents to $2.9738 per gallon. (Reporting by  Robert Gibbons ; Editing by  David Gregorio )
