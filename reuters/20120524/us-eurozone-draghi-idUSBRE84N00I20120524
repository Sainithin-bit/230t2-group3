 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Issuing jointly backed European debt would not make sense until the euro zone reaches some kind of fiscal union, the European Central Bank's President Mario Draghi said on Thursday at the end of a meeting of EU leaders. 
 "Euro bonds make sense when you have a fiscal union, otherwise they don't make sense. They are the first step towards a fiscal union," Draghi told reporters in Brussels (Reporting By  John O'Donnell  and Robin Emmott)
