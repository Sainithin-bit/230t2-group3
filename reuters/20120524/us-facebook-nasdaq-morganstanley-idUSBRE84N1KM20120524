 (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) will adjust thousands of trades to ensure no limit orders will be filled at more than $43 a share for Facebook ( FB.O ) stock from last Friday's botched initial public offering, the firm told its brokers on Thursday, a person familiar with the call said. 
 The source, a broker who could not speak for attribution, said the firm again insisted that the trading problems were Nasdaq-related. ( NDAQ.O ) (This story is corrected to reflect nature and timing of orders being adjusted) (Reporting By  Ben Berkowitz ; Editing by  Gary Hill  and Phil Berlowitz)
