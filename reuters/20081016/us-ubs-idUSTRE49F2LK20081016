 (Reuters) - UBS AG ( UBSN.VX ) will get a 6 billion francs capital injection from the Swiss government and will unload up $60 billion of illiquid securities and other assets to a separate fund entity agreed with the Swiss National Bank. 

 Here is an edited version of its statement. SUMMARY The Swiss National Bank (SNB) and UBS have reached an agreement to transfer up to $60 billion of currently illiquid securities and other assets from UBS's balance sheet to a separate fund entity. With this transaction, UBS caps future potential losses from these assets, secures their long-term funding, reduces its risk-weighted assets, and materially de-risks and reduces its balance sheet. This transaction allows the SNB and shareholders of UBS to participate in the recovery potential of the entity's assets once the loan is fully repaid. The solution significantly reduces the uncertainty for UBS shareholders and clients and contributes to the stability of the financial system by ensuring an orderly sale of these assets. The fund will be capitalized with up to $6 billion of equity capital provided by UBS and a non-recourse loan in the maximum amount of $54 billion provided to the fund by the SNB. The entity will be controlled by the SNB. UBS will sell its equity interests to SNB for $1 and will have an option to repurchase the equity once the loan is fully repaid for a purchase price of $1 billion plus half of the equity value exceeding $1 billion. To fund its equity contribution, and at the same time maintain its strong capital position, UBS can raise 6 billion Swiss francs of new capital in the form of mandatory convertible notes (MCN). The MCN has been fully placed with the Swiss Confederation. EXECUTIVE COMMENTS Peter Kurer, Chairman of UBS said, "In these turbulent times we want to ensure that we do everything possible to safeguard the solidity of our bank. We are taking practical steps to eliminate legacy risks. We thank the Swiss Government and the Swiss National Bank for their willingness to develop a commercial solution under economic terms that will support both the stability of the Swiss financial system and UBS. Their efforts and decisiveness to act swiftly demonstrates the professionalism of the Swiss financial center, to which we are deeply committed." Marcel Rohner, Group CEO said, "This transaction gives comfort in UBS's future. The extremely difficult market environment led us to accelerate our risk reduction with a definitive move. Our aim is to protect our clients from the impact of the crisis to the fullest extent possible and to provide our shareholders an opportunity to renew their confidence in the bank. Our shareholders have borne the losses from this crisis. They now have the certainty that our risks related to these distressed assets have been substantially removed while still participating in the recovery of these assets." FOURTH QUARTER CHARGE The transaction will result in a significant reduction in UBS's risk-weighted assets and its balance sheet total. The impact of the transaction and related capital measures will be shown in the fourth quarter results separately from the operating performance. On a preliminary basis, UBS estimates that the transaction will result in a charge against earnings of approximately 4 billion Swiss francs. These impacts would produce a year-end Tier 1 ratio of approximately 11.5%, before any other fourth quarter effects. NEW CAPITAL UBS will raise 6 billion Swiss francs of new capital in the form of mandatory convertible notes (MCN). This will allow the bank to retain a strong Tier 1 capital ratio, even after providing the equity to the newly established entity. The MCN has been fully placed with the Swiss Confederation. The Swiss Confederation reserves the right to reduce part or all of its investment by transferring the MCN to third party investors. The MCN issue is subject to approval by UBS shareholders who will vote on the creation of the required conditional capital underlying the MCN at an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) to be held in late November 2008. The MCN will count as Tier 1 capital for BIS capital adequacy purposes following EGM approval. Issuance of the MCN is expected to take place five business days after the EGM. Upon conversion of the mandatory convertible note (MCN), the Swiss Confederation will hold approximately 9.3 percent of UBS's share capital, on the basis of currently outstanding shares and assuming conversion of the mandatory convertible notes issued in March 2008. THIRD QUARTER UPDATE In line with the pre-announcement on 2 October, UBS recorded a small net profit attributable to its shareholders of 296 million Swiss francs for third quarter 2008. Estimated third quarter results by division are: * Global Wealth Management & Business Banking's profit before tax rose 66 percent from second quarter 2008 to 1.862 billion Swiss francs. The previous quarter, however, included a provision of 919 million Swiss francs for the expected costs of the repurchase of auction rate securities and related costs, including fines. * Global Asset Management's pre-tax profit was 414 million Swiss francs, up 18 percent from the previous quarter. This includes an extraordinary gain of approximately 168 million Swiss francs from the previously announced disposal of Adams Street Partners. * The Investment Bank's pre-tax result was negative CHF 2,748 million, compared to a loss of 5.233 billion Swiss francs in the second quarter. As credit spreads widened in the third quarter, the Investment Bank recorded gains of 2.,207 billion Swiss francs on own credit (compared to CHF 122 million in second quarter). Disclosed concentrated risk positions were significantly reduced by $13.5 billion, mainly through the sale of assets. Writedowns and losses on those disclosed positions totaled $4.4 billion (compared to $5.1 billion in second quarter), recorded in the Investment Bank's Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities (FICC) business. Revenues were down across businesses, in line with prevailing market conditions. Group results in third quarter include a tax credit of CHF 912 million. Costs were again reduced across the bank, with cuts in discretionary spending and lower personnel expenses, reflecting lower staff levels and a decrease in bonus accruals in line with business performance. During third quarter, UBS reduced its balance sheet by around CHF 80 billion to CHF 1,997 billion. UBS's total BIS capital ratio on 30 September was estimated at 14.8% and its Tier 1 ratio at approximately 10.8%, compared to 15.7% and 11.6% respectively at the end of June. Wealth Management & Business Banking invested assets were CHF 1,932 billion. The division recorded net new money of negative CHF 49.3 billion in the third quarter, with a significant part of the outflow taking place in the last few weeks of the quarter. Global Asset Management invested assets were CHF 708 billion with net new money negative 34.4 billion. With today's measures, in addition to its earlier steps, UBS is confident that it has created the conditions necessary to reverse the outflow of client assets. ($1=1.133 Swiss Franc)
