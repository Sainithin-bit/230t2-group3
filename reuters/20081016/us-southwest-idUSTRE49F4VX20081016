 (Adds dropped word "million" to net loss figure in 2nd paragraph) 

 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Southwest Airlines ( LUV.N ) reported a quarterly net loss on Thursday, reversing a year-ago profit, on charges related to its fuel hedging program. The low-cost airline's third-quarter net loss amounted to $120 million, or 16 cents per share, compared with a profit of $162 million, or 22 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, Southwest earned $69 million, or 9 cents per share, beating the average Wall Street estimate of 7 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. The airline industry has been severely battered this year by soaring fuel costs that peeked at a record high in July before falling rapidly. Southwest, whose fuel hedges are the envy of the industry, was somewhat insulated from the spike in fuel prices but reported charges of $247 million related to adjustments on a portion of the future period of its hedge portfolio. The airline's revenue rose about 12 percent to $2.9 billion. The company ended the quarter with $3.4 billion in cash and short term investments. (Reporting by Kyle Peterson)
