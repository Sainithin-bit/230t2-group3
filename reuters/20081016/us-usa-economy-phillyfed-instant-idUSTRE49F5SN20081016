 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Mid-Atlantic factory activity crashed in October, a survey showed on Thursday. 

 The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank said its business activity index slumped unexpectedly hard to -37.5 in October from 3.8 in September. KEY POINTS: * The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank said its business activity index slumped unexpectedly hard to -37.5 in October from 3.8 in September. * Wall Street economists had expected a reading of minus 10.0, according to a Reuters poll. Their 54 forecasts ranged from minus 25.0 to plus 5.0. * A reading below zero indicates contraction in manufacturing in the region, which encompasses eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware and is as one of the first monthly indicators of the health of the U.S. manufacturing sector COMMENTS: DANA SAPORTA, ECONOMIST, DRESDNER KLEINWORT, NEW YORK: "The data put simply were horrendous coming out of the Philadelphia Fed region today. This reading is consistent with the recession we are in and probably have probably been in for a while." ALAN RUSKIN, CHIEF INTERNATIONAL STRATEGIST, RBS GLOBAL BANKING IN GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT: "The Philly Fed data provides the first reliable lead into the October numbers, and confirms that the meltdown in financial markets is being closely followed by a dramatic slide in real economic activity. All the Philly Fed growth components collapsed both present and 6 months out, and the only good news was that the price numbers similarly confirmed that we have turned off the mains to inflation dramatically. A Philly Fed at -37.5 is consistent with an ISM number below 40. We have seen weaker Philly Fed data but only fleetingly at the depths of recessions. Ugly data, more risk aversion." CHRIS RUPKEY, CHIEF FINANCIAL ECONOMIST, BANK OF TOKYO-MITSUBISHI UFJ, NEW YORK: "It is one for the record books, or just about. It is just a thumbs up or thumbs down reading on the prospects for the manufacturing sector, it is not especially based on shipments or orders, and so it is a fairly accurate reading of the severity of the credit crunch that has hit the economy with full force following the Lehman bankruptcy on September 15. It shouldn't be a shock, but the stock market has turned around. It is a sign that the economy is falling away quickly, and it is certainly consistent with the recession that we seem to be in." BRIAN DOLAN, CHIEF CURRENCY STRATEGIST, FOREX.COM, BEDMINSTER, NEW JERSEY: "Philly Fed drop is shocking and we're going to see stocks dive. All the sub-gauges are equally horrendous and paint a bleak picture of the future. However, it's a fluid sentiment index and coming as it does at the peak of the maelstrom, it probably exaggerates the true state of affairs." STEVEN BUTLER, DIRECTOR, FX TRADING, SCOTIA CAPITAL, TORONTO: "The Philly Fed data, which reflects a further slowdown in the U.S. economy, is not good for the dollar. We're starting to see investors focusing a little more on the economy and a bit less on the financial crisis." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. equities turn negative after Philly Fed. BONDS: Treasury debt prices turn higher. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar pares gains vs. yen. RATE FUTURES: Fed fund futures increase chance of 50 basis point interest rate cut at October meeting.
