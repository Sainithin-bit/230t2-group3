 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Nike Inc ( NKE.N ) has sued Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ), saying the world's largest retailer is selling athletic shoes that infringe on its design patents. 

 In a complaint filed on Monday, Nike claims Wal-Mart is selling shoes that infringe on its Shox line, which is designed with what looks like springs in the heels. "Wal-Mart knowingly and intentionally sold and continues to sell the infringing Shoes as simulations of Nike shoes," the Nike complaint states. Nike is seeking an order to bar Wal-Mart from selling items that infringe on its patents and "damages adequate to compensate Nike for the patent infringement that has occurred." Wal-Mart could not be reached for an immediate comment. The complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division.
