 CHICAGO/NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Volatile fuel prices caused losses at Continental Airlines CAL.N and low-cost carrier Southwest Airlines ( LUV.N ) in the third quarter as they struggled to adjust to wild swings in the cost of fuel. 

 Both airlines were cautious on the future as a recession looms, but shares of all major U.S. airlines rose sharply as oil plunged to a 14-month low. "On one hand, fuel prices have declined significantly and if they stay around their current level, we'll benefit greatly," said Continental chief executive Larry Kellner on a conference call with analysts. "On the other hand, we know that demand for air travel will be adversely affected by a recession, and it remains to be seen how deep, wide and long the recession will be." Continental blamed its quarterly loss on soaring fuel prices in the quarter. Southwest, which has been protected from oil's spike by its fuel hedges, reported a loss because it had to write down the value of those hedges. "I can assure you that falling energy prices is a great thing for Southwest Airlines," Southwest CEO Gary Kelly told reporters. But he added that it may be time to "dehedge a bit," because "nobody knows where the bottom is," referring to the plunging price of oil. After trading up and down, Continental shares were up 13 percent at $14.50 in early afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Southwest shares were up 4.8 percent at $12.12. CONTINENTAL WARY OF RECESSION Continental blamed its loss on a spike in fuel prices that accompanied the run-up in crude oil to a record high in July. Expensive fuel also plagued Continental's rivals AMR Corp AMR.N, parent of American Airlines, and Delta Air Lines ( DAL.N ), which reported losses on Wednesday. While fuel is now much lower, Continental was more concerned with a recession and the impact of the current financial turmoil. The Houston-based airline said it was expecting to see a hit on corporate travel, especially among Wall Street banks, and was already seeing slower growth in sales on its online booking site, signaling weakness in the leisure travel market. "Retail sales are down, industrial production dropped to its lowest level in 34 years -- clearly, the U.S. is headed into a recession," said Basili Alukos, an analyst at Morningstar. "Therefore, the tendency is for customers to scale back, which means they will fly less." Anticipating cutbacks in capacity, Continental delayed the delivery of some planes from Boeing Co ( BA.N ), a setback for the plane maker which is already grappling with a strike by its assembly workers. SOUTHWEST HEDGES IN THE MONEY While Continental was hurt by fuel prices on the way up, Southwest was cut by the other side of that sword. The carrier, whose fuel hedges are the envy of the industry, wrote down $247 million in mark-to-market losses on the value of its fuel hedge program after a stunning 50 percent drop in oil prices since July 11, when crude hit its record high above $148. Despite the drop in fuel prices, which lessened the value of its hedge portfolio, Southwest said its fuel hedge remains "in the money," meaning it has locked in prices that are below current market prices. Southwest said that because of the strike at Boeing, it will likely not take delivery of three remaining planes originally scheduled for this year. The carrier said it now expects to take delivery of 13 Boeing 737-700 aircraft next year. (Editing by Maureen Bavdek and  Tim Dobbyn )
