 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - UnitedHealth Group Inc ( UNH.N ) offered a cautious 2009 profit forecast influenced by the weak economy that fell below Wall Street's target, overshadowing enthusiasm for its third-quarter results. 

 The largest U.S. health insurer by market value, which moved up its earnings report by five days, said it assumed job cuts stemming from the troubled economy would hurt its enrollment. It projected enrollment at the end of the first quarter in 2009 would be down "significantly" from year end. "The negative economic climate and outlook severely limits our visibility into 2009," UnitedHealth CEO Stephen Hemsley told analysts on a conference call. The forecast led company shares to fall by 1.4 percent after rising as much as 9.8 percent in opening trading as the company posted third-quarter profit that met expectations. Analysts cited improving membership trends for its employer plans and said medical costs ate into premium revenue less than expected. "I think it was a decent quarter, but the 2009 guidance was not very bullish," said Sanford Bernstein analyst Ana Gupte. "My sense is the company is being conservative." UnitedHealth twice reduced its initial 2008 expectations earlier this year amid challenges for its commercial business for employers and its Medicare plans for seniors. Health insurers, whose shares have been crippled this year amid worries of a sector downturn, also have been pressured in recent weeks because of concerns about their investment portfolios amid the global credit crisis. UnitedHealth, the first U.S. health insurer to report results this period, said its balance sheet position was "strong," with more than $6 billion of its $20 billion portfolio in cash and cash equivalents and the rest in a diversified investment-grade portfolio. The Minneapolis-based company also said it reduced its total debt position by $337 million in the quarter, and had 2 cents per share in net capital losses on investments. "There were no major broken investments that the company took any big charges for," said Stifel Nicolaus analyst Thomas Carroll. IN LINE Third-quarter net income fell to $920 million, or 75 cents per share, from $1.28 billion, or 95 cents per share, a year ago. Excluding certain items, adjusted earnings of 73 cents were in line with analyst estimates, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 7.9 percent to $20.16 billion. UnitedHealth's medical care ratio, a key profitability measure of medical costs as a percentage of premiums, worsened to 81.7 percent from 79.5 percent a year ago. Premiums have not kept pace with costs in some of its plans for employers, seniors and mental health patients, the company said. But the result was better than the 82.7 percent expected by Bank of America analyst Brian Wright, who called that the "highlight" of the report. Goldman Sachs analyst Matthew Borsch said in a research note: "Overall the results show significant improvement from (the first half) and were better than expected." The company forecast 2009 earnings per share of $2.90 to $3.15. Analysts had expected $3.18. Earnings for 2008 are now expected to be $2.95 to $2.99 per share, Borsch said. UnitedHealth had been expected to report results on October 21, but announced on Wednesday it was moving up its report to provide it to the market in a "timely" fashion. UnitedHealth shares were down 31 cents at $21.36 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange as other health insurers also traded lower. Through Wednesday, shares of UnitedHealth had slumped 63 percent this year, worse than a 56 percent drop for the S&P Managed Health Care index .GSPHMO.
