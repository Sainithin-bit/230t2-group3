 VILNIUS  (Reuters) - Lithuania's economy is facing a slowdown, but it will try not to breach the European Union's deficit ceiling and rejects any suggestion of comparisons the Icelandic crisis, the finance minister said on Thursday. 

 "Of course, the public sector deficit will be higher than that of the state budget, but we will try to make sure it does not exceed 3 percent," Finance Minister Rimantas Sadzius told Reuters in an interview. Dalia Grybauskaite, the EU budget commissioner who is from Lithuania, on Wednesday warned that her country's public sector budget deficit could overshoot the EU limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). The public sector includes the government budget, municipalities and social funds. Lithuania has abandoned plans for a balanced budget next year, aiming for a deficit of 2.3 percent of GDP. The gap is also this year expected to be higher than the planned 0.5 percent of GDP. The fiscal derailment has come due to a slowing economy. The Finance Ministry forecasts growth next year of 1.5 percent after 5.3 percent this year. The International Monetary Fund has forecast Lithuanian growth next of just 0.7 percent. "The economy is likely to recover to close to its potential growth rate in 2011, but much depends on external factors, such as the situation in the main export markets," Sadzius said. "We do not exclude the hard landing scenario, but we are working hard to avoid it," he added. The ministry expects the economy to recover to 4.5 percent growth in 2011. "We are going to move to a single-digit zone. I personally, think this is going to happen already in December," Sadzius said. The inflation rate eased to 11 percent in September from a decade-high of 12.5 percent in June. He said the inflation rate reached its peak in the summer and would fall gradually. He said that despite the slowdown, Lithuania was not similar to Iceland, though the two share wide current account deficits. "Lithuanian banks are not living through the easiest of times, but they are stable, and the banking system is healthy, based on foreign capital coming from countries with conservative banking traditions," Sadzius said. The three large banks -- SEB, Swedbank and DnB Nord -- account for more than two-thirds of the bank sector share by assets and loans. "We also have a currency board regime. These two things guarantee the stability of our banking system," Sadzius said. "I categorically reject the possibility Lithuania may follow the path of Iceland, our situation is completely different." (Reporting by Nerijus Adomaitis; Editing by Victoria Main)
