 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Mid-Atlantic regional factory activity crashed to an 18-year low in October, a survey showed on Thursday, adding to the grim toll the last month of credit turmoil has taken on the economy. 

 The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank said its business activity index slumped unexpectedly hard to -37.5 in October from 3.8 in September. That was its lowest since October 1990. "The data, put simply, were horrendous coming out of the Philadelphia Fed region today," said Dana Saporta, economist at Dresdner Kleinwort in New York. "This reading is consistent with the recession we are in and probably have probably been in for a while." U.S. stocks turned negative on the news and the dollar pared its gains versus the yen. U.S. government bonds, which benefit during weak economic times, pared their losses. Wall Street economists had expected a reading of minus 10.0, according to a Reuters poll. Their 54 forecasts ranged from minus 25.0 to plus 5.0. The report was bleak across the board. The index of new orders tumbled to the lowest since 1980, indicating a very poor outlook. The survey's gauge of employment fell to its lowest since December 2001. A reading below zero indicates contraction manufacturing in the region, which encompasses eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware and is as one of the first monthly indicators of the health of the U.S. manufacturing sector.
