 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Advanced Micro Devices Inc's ( AMD.N ) quarterly results bettered Wall Street targets on Thursday, and its shares rose 33 cents in after hours trading as the smaller rival to Intel Corp ( INTC.O ) prepared to become two companies. 

 Net loss for the third quarter ending September 27 was $67 million, or 11 cents per diluted share, compared with a loss of $396 million, or 71 cents per diluted share, in the same quarter a year earlier. After excluding charges, the company made 13 cents a share, far better than the average analyst estimate of a loss of 39 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Net revenue rose to $1.78 billion, ahead of the average analysts' estimate of $1.48 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. AMD stock is down about 50 percent since the start of the year, compared with a 43 percent loss by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index .SOXX during the same period.
