 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oil fell more than 6 percent to below $70 a barrel on Thursday, touching a 15-month low on rising U.S. inventories and concerns a possible recession would slow demand further. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 slipped in a choppy session on Thursday as major U.S. banks reported huge losses and other companies painted a grim outlook for the battered U.S. economy. U.S. crude settled at $69.85, down $4.69, after sliding to as low as $68.57, the lowest level since June 27, 2007. In London, front month November Brent crude, which expires on Thursday, settled at $66.32, down $4.48. "It's still a demand story, we're moving lower following the report," said Amanda Kurzendoerfer, commodities analyst at Summit Energy in Louisville, Kentucky. "We saw some very large builds in gasoline and crude oil for the second week in a row. This confirms the fact that demand is truly weakening in the United States," she added. Crude oil inventories in the United States rose 5.6 million barrels last week, far exceeding analysts' expectation of a 1.9-million-barrel increase, as demand in the world's top consumer continued to fall, the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported. Gasoline inventories rose 7.0 million barrels, more than double analysts' forecast of a 2.9-million-barrel increase, as overall product demand over the past four weeks dropped 8.9 percent from year ago levels. U.S. crude has fallen from record highs above $147 hit in July, and has dropped nearly a third in value in three weeks, the steepest such decline since it began trading in 1983 amid the mounting threat of a global recession. Data from the Federal Reserve showed U.S. industrial production posted the biggest monthly decline since 1974. "Economic weakness is hitting the stock and oil markets, but the oil price fall is also reflecting a lack of demand. It is very difficult to buy oil if you are having a hard time getting credit lined up," said Francisco Blanch, head of commodity research at Merrill Lynch. Analysts have scaled back global oil demand growth estimates after a slew of gloomy economic data that suggest the credit crisis has begun to undermine economic growth in the United States, the world's top energy consumer. OPEC The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) said on Thursday it had brought forward to Friday next week an emergency meeting to discuss the impact of global recession on oil markets. Pressure has been mounting within the 13-member group to reduce supplies. There are expectations it may take action to support prices. Nigerian Oil Minister Odein Ajumogobia said the emergency OPEC meeting was an opportunity to consider options regarding the world oil price but that no course of action had yet been proposed. "I regard it as an exploratory meeting to review facts and options. Not even tentative proposals have been discussed at this stage," Ajumogobia told Reuters. Hurricane Omar weakened rapidly as it surged into the Atlantic on Thursday, after threading its way through the small islands of the northeastern Caribbean as a fiercely powerful storm that ended up causing relatively little damage, U.S. forecasters said.
