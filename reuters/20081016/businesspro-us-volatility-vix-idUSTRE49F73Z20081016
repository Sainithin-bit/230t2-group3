 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index .VIX, Wall Street's main barometer of investor fear, surged to new highs on Thursday, in a sign investors remain cautious and anticipate more market turmoil. 

 The widely-watched VIX vaulted to an unprecedented high of 81.17 before retracing to 78.62, up 13.68 percent. "We are seeing the VIX enter new historic levels as investors and traders continue to seek out protection and hedges at an apparently more frantic pace," said Scott Fullman, director of derivative investment strategy at broker-dealer WJB Capital in New York. The index blew past last Friday's record highs of 76.94 and is now in uncharted territory based on the modern VIX format which only goes back to 1990. "Fear is driving the market. It is due to the ongoing credit crisis and the subsequent risk to the global economy," said Frederic Ruffy, options strategist at New York-based Web information site WhatsTrading.com. There are concerns, given the massive expansion in credit over the past years and the heavy reliance on debt on the part of both financial and non-financial companies, that frozen credit markets will tip the global economy into a deep recession, Ruffy added. The VIX tracks projected volatility embedded in Standard & Poor's 500 index  .SPX  option prices and tends to move inversely to the S&P 500 benchmark. It shot up quickly this morning as U.S. stocks slid on data showing signs of regional weakness in manufacturing, igniting recession fears, one day after the S&P 500 had it worst tumble since the 1987 market crash. As stock prices fall and investors grow more anxious, the demand for portfolio protection in the form of index options rises, pushing up the price of that insurance. Technically, the VIX is testing the extended resistance trend line of 80.45 on the daily chart, suggesting it has reached extremely overbought levels, Fullman said. It is trading above two standard deviations of the 20-day moving average of 48.57, reflecting this extreme upward movement. The VIX tends to revert to its average and rarely remains at lofty levels in extended periods. But during this stretch of heightened volatility investors have been aggressively bidding up put options or VIX calls in anticipation of more volatility, Fullman said.
