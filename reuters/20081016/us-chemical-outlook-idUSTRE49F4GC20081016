 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The lingering effects of Hurricanes Gustav and Ike are likely to hurt the third-quarter profits of some U.S. chemical makers, and analysts and investors alike will be closely watching quarterly results for signs of weakening demand in quarters to come. 

 Early indications suggest that the sector is already feeling the pinch from the global credit freeze, as the weak domestic automotive and housing end-markets are showing signs of further deterioration. "Now that the storms have passed, we have a much bigger storm that we are battening the hatches for right now, in terms of what is going on with the economy," said Morningstar analyst Ben Johnson. The U.S. chemical sector was battered by soaring crude oil and natural gas costs in the first half of 2008; although these cost pressures have waned, the turmoil in financial markets has caused concerns and some analysts have trimmed their 2008 and 2009 earnings expectations. Wall Street is especially concerned about a weakening in overseas demand. Profits of U.S. chemical makers, in recent quarters, have been buoyed by strong demand from developing economies, but the global financial crisis is likely to crimp international results going forward. "This (crisis) will obviously be the subject of all the conference calls that will start in the coming weeks," said Soleil Securities analyst Mark Gulley. Furthermore, the tailwind from a weak U.S. dollar, which many chemical companies have enjoyed in recent quarters, is unlikely to provide much of a boost in upcoming results, as the dollar has pared some its losses. Bank of America analyst Kevin McCarthy estimates that the strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the euro, Brazilian real and Asian currencies will prove to become a headwind as early as the fourth quarter and a 5 to 6 percent drag by mid-2009. MIXED RESULTS The third-quarter results of most U.S. chemical makers will be hurt by the hurricanes that hit the Gulf Coast this September. The storms caused major utility outages and idled about a quarter of U.S. crude oil production and refining assets, which are a key source of raw materials for the chemical sector. "Whether it be their plants directly, or the supplies coming into their plant gates -- the ripple effects have been felt by just about everybody in the North American chemical industry," said Morningstar's Johnson. Since the hurricanes struck, chemical shipments via railroads have fallen sharply, in stark contrast to the earlier part of the year, when shipments had risen consistently. Last month, the world's No. 2 paint and coatings maker PPG Industries Inc ( PPG.N ) warned that its third-quarter results would be reduced by hurricane-related shutdowns, along with a workers strike at Boeing Co ( BA.N ) and a further deterioration in the U.S. automotive sector. However, the hurricanes this year are unlikely to have a prolonged impact on the industry. "The damage from these hurricanes in 2008 is nowhere near the damage that was suffered in 2005. This time it was problems with utilities, but there was little direct damage to production facilities or customers' facilities," said Soleil's Gulley. The hurricanes might actually help some chemical makers, as hurricane-related shutdowns in September caused shortages of some chemicals. "The tightness of such products as caustic soda, soda ash, and polyethylene (temporarily in September) has allowed some producers to expand margins through price increases," said BB&T analyst Frank Mitsch, in a note to clients. Additionally, the sharp decline in crude oil and natural gas prices will also boost profit margins in the quarter. Last week, Eastman Chemical Co ( EMN.N ) said its third-quarter results would beat expectations, as the recent decline in raw material and energy costs, coupled with higher sales revenue, will offset lower sales volume due to softening demand. However, the sharp drop in energy costs does not necessarily spell good times for chemical producers. "The current drop in energy prices is likely due to lower expected global demand in 2009, hence lower chemical demand. If true, this would lead to reduced pricing power for many chemical manufactures, therefore reduced profitability," said Barclays Capital analyst Sergey Vasnetsov.
