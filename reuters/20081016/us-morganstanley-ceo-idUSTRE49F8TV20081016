 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) Chief Executive John Mack said on Thursday the company would likely cut back in a number of businesses in light of the global financial crisis roiling banks and weighing down the economy. 

 In an interview with CNBC television, Mack said the global economy appears to be in a deep recession, adding that he would not be surprised if the slump lasted into 2010. "Clearly 2009 is going to be a slow period of growth for the United States and the world," he said on the sidelines of a Business Council meeting in Kiawah Island, South Carolina. "It could be a year, or more" before there is a recovery, he added. Mack said the ongoing crisis is unlike anything he has ever seen because it is global and "credit has absolutely dried up." Moreover, the market must now deal with the aftermath of excessive leverage employed by banks and fund managers. "We're all learning that leverage works both ways," Mack said, referring to the measure of how much debt a company supports with its equity capital. Yet as Morgan Stanley and other companies move to reduce leverage, profit and revenues have plunged, forcing banks to cut back. "Any time you take a business running at 30 times (leverage) and take it down to 16 to 17, that changes the nature of your business," he said. "We have to look at that and resize it." As many as 30 percent of hedge funds are expected to go out of business in the next year due to market losses and redemptions, Mack said. As a result, revenues flowing through Morgan's prime brokerage business will decline. Morgan Stanley shares some of the blame for being overleveraged, he said, and has been shedding assets and raising capital to reduce its leverage ratio. Morgan Stanley now has less than $20 of assets for every dollar of equity, down from more than $30. The company intends to reduce the ratio to the "mid teens," after factoring in two capital raising deals. On Monday, Morgan agreed to sell a 21 percent stake to Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc ( 8306.T ) for $9 billion. On Tuesday, it agreed to sell $10 billion of preferred stock to the U.S. Treasury. Mack predicted that the deleveraging trend is far from over, citing unnamed European banks with 40 times leverage. "There's more work to be done. And it's not just investment banks. It's also the fund managers." He also noted the company is likely to continue investing in its $600 billion asset management business and a wealth management arm with about 9,000 financial advisers. Mack also suggested the global nature of the financial crisis has created the need for cross-border regulation. "It shows us that securities regulation and coordination has to be done on a global basis. I don't think it can be done country by country," he said. "It's pretty difficult to say I'll work under one set of rules in one country and a different set somewhere else." Morgan Stanley shares rose 24 cents to $18.37 on the New York Stock Exchange.
