 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Google Inc ( GOOG.O ) reported stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings as growth in its Internet advertising revenues withstood the global financial crisis, sending its shares up about 7 percent. 

 COMMENTARY: COLIN GILLIS, ANALYST, CANACCORD ADAMS "It's a nice clean quarter. In this environment, it's enough to send the stock zooming in the after-hours. It's the power of the model -- paid search is the best form of media advertising out there." "Even in a down market, advertisers are going to be seeking customers. These results separate out Google from the eBays ( EBAY.O ) and the Yahoos ( YHOO.O ) in the space." GREG WOODARD, PORTFOLIO STRATEGIST, MANNING & NAPIER ADVISORS IN FAIRPORT, NEW YORK "Obviously investors will be very happy with the earnings per share. The whisper number was around $4.60, I think the general consensus was that they were going to miss, so it's certainly an upside surprise." "Going forward, I think there's too much pessimism baked in with this market environment to see shares rise much. The highest quality names are getting sold first and are seeing some of the biggest losses. Google we'd quantify as being in a great competitive position, with gaining market share in the U.S. and overseas and in terms of being a dominant player in the industry globally." "While it won't be immune from the economic downturn, the valuation is very competitive, and at the same time, Yahoo, its biggest competitor, is struggling. So from a competitive stance, they're great. And the business model will remain intact after we exit the credit crisis." "All would indicate that people will continue to see the secular shift of advertising to the online venues so we would continue to monitor that going forward. As I mentioned, they won't be immune to the economic downturn but I think they'll emerge strong." MARIANNE WOLK, ANALYST, SUSQUEHANNA FINANCIAL GROUP "Very strong execution in a very difficult market." "They're doing a much better job controlling expenses and headcount growth and I really think the key now will be hearing their tone regarding the fourth quarter." CLAYTON MORAN, ANALYST, STANFORD FINANCIAL GROUP "It's a very good quarter, essentially, across the board for Google. They beat the Street expectation on cash flow and EPS. If you wanted to look a little deeper, it was pretty good in the U.S. and on the Google.com site itself. The U.S. has been an area that was a little bit of a drag in previous quarters." "In the third quarter we saw a stabilization of the trends that had weakened the first half of the year. The first half of the year you saw consumers pull back, the number of ads Google was showing was down. In the third quarter, that seemed to stabilize. If you could point to one underlying metric, that would be it. The ad coverage stabilized after dropping off this year." "The stock is up. That's not a surprise given they beat the expectations in a very tough environment." "Even though these numbers are good, I think investors will be cautious about what's happening in the fourth quarter." MARTIN PYYKKONEN, ANALYST, WUNDERLICH SECURITIES "Looks like they controlled their operating expenses and hiring in the quarter, which very recently and through the quarter has been one of the main issues." "On balance, everything in their numbers look solid. Margins were good, controlling their expenses in light of the economy especially but just in general." Google has "gotten beaten down with the market. I think over the longer haul, if this (is) a longer and deeper recession than people would like it to be, I don't think they're immune, but I think right now you have a little bit of a relief rally." YOUSSEF SQUALI, ANALYST, JEFFERIES & CO "On a relative basis, 18 percent growth in paid clicks is impressive and points to the fact that search does perform better than other mediums."
