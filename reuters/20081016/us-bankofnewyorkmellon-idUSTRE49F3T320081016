 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bank of New York Mellon Corp's ( BK.N ) third-quarter profit fell 53 percent due of securities losses and a big charge to bail out money market funds, but operating results topped forecasts. 

 Chief Executive Robert Kelly said the bank, one of nine so far to participate in U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson's $250 billion plan to help unlock credit markets, will use its $3 billion injection to expand loan and deposit activity in its wealth management unit and to provide short-term financing for banking clients. "Banks haven't been lending with each other, but we are, and we're doing more of it," Kelly said in an interview. "Most counterparties have been willing to lend only overnight, and we, in contrast, because of our relatively strong capital base and the flight to quality we have enjoyed, are supporting financial institution clients in particular by providing term funding of as long as one month, which helps stabilize the market." Quarterly net income declined to $303 million, or 26 cents per share, from $640 million, or 56 cents, a year earlier, the bank said on Thursday. Excluding one-time items, profit was 72 cents per share, topping analysts' average forecast of 69 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 1 percent to $3.63 billion, short of the average forecast of $3.71 billion. Growth in securities servicing, which involves providing custodial and other services to institutional investors and is the bank's biggest source of revenue, helped offset $162 million of losses on mortgage and other securities holdings. Results included a charge of $433 million, or 37 cents per share, to rescue 10 funds that invested in securities of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEHMQ.PK, which went bankrupt. The rescue shielded investors from losing principal. The bank also had 6 cents per share of merger costs, and a 3 cents per share charge for an Internal Revenue Service settlement over structured lease transactions. Another major custody bank, State Street Corp ( STT.N ), posted a 33 percent increase in quarterly profit on Wednesday. Bank of New York Mellon shares rose $1.50, or 5.1 percent, to $30.75 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange but later gave up most of those gains. Through Wednesday, the shares were down 40 percent this year. NO ACQUISITIONS PLANNED On a conference call, Kelly said the $3 billion of new capital "in essence strengthens our balance sheet, and I don't intend to be using it." In the interview, he clarified that he was referring to not using the funds for acquisitions, which he expects to become "cheaper" in future quarters. The bank this week also won a coveted mandate to provide custodial services for Paulson's $700 billion financial industry bailout. Bank of New York Mellon's Tier-1 capital ratio, which measures its ability to cover losses, ended September 30 at 9.33 percent, above the 6 percent regulatory minimum. It said the ratio could rise to 12 percent including the new capital. "We don't need more capital," Kelly said. Bank of New York's July 2007 purchase of Mellon created a custodial power now handling $22.4 trillion of assets, and an asset manager now overseeing $1.07 trillion. Third-quarter revenue from securities servicing rose 6 percent to $1.54 billion, while declining equity markets led to a 7 percent drop in asset and wealth management fees to $792 million. "We're clearly in the most uncertain environment we've ever seen ourselves in for certainly many, many years," Kelly said on the conference call. "We have lots of expenses and there's lots of ways in which we can work those down." Bank of New York Mellon still faces a $22.5 billion lawsuit by Russia related to a 2000 money-laundering case involving a former bank vice president. Bank of New York in November 2005 agreed to pay $38 million to settle two U.S. criminal probes. Founded in 1784 by Alexander Hamilton, Bank of New York is the oldest U.S. banking company. Mellon was founded in 1869 and grew to prominence under financier Andrew Mellon. Both companies quit branch banking this decade. (Editing by  Derek Caney  and John Wallace)
