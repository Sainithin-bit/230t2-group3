 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc on Thursday posted its fourth straight quarterly loss, hurt by increasing credit losses and write-downs tied to complex or low quality debt. 

 The net loss totaled $2.8 billion, or 60 cents per share, and compared with a profit of $2.2 billion, or 44 cents, a year earlier. Revenue fell 23 percent to $16.7 billion, while expenses rose 2 percent to $14.4 billion. Market reaction: Citigroup shares rose less than 1 percent to $16.35 in premarket trading. The following is reaction from industry analysts and investors: MATT MCCORMICK, PORTFOLIO MANAGER AND BANKING ANALYST, BAHL & GAYNOR INVESTMENT COUNSEL, INC IN CINCINNATI "I always said there will be two types of banks: those that survive and grab market share, and those that struggle. Citigroup is trying to position itself as being in the strong camp. They're going to be trying to tell people that they're turning the corner. But that doesn't make their job any easier. They have significant economic headwinds, and they have continued exposure to illiquid securities. "They beat expectations this quarter, but they're not hitting the ball out of the park. It's not an investment for the faint of heart. I'd expect continued pressure and volatility for the next year at least." (Reporting by  Dan Wilchins )
