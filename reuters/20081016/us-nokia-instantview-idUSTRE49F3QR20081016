 HELSINKI  (Reuters) - Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ), the world's top cellphone maker, reported on Thursday underlying quarterly earnings below expectations, but its outlook for the rest of the year calmed jittery markets. 

 Following are views from analysts on the results: INGE HEYDORN, FUND MANAGER, SENTAT ASSET MANAGEMENT "The margin looks strong. They keep their market volume forecast. Nokia has on purpose put the brake on sales. Cash flow is fantastic. It is overall a strong report." JARI HONKO, EQ BANK "Overall, it was very much in line with the consensus median. Sales and average sales price are below, but the operating profitability for the units are slightly ahead of the estimates. When it comes to guidance, it was very close to expectations. Very much in line with my reports. "Market share was slightly below, but I wouldn't pay too much attention to that now. I prioritize the overall result. Market share is important, but overall the devices margin and the ASP this quarter will matter the most." HAKAN WRANNE, SWEDBANK "I think people are breathing a sigh of relief that the phone market isn't going completely to pieces now in the fourth quarter. I think the most important thing Nokia is saying is that they expect the market to grow 10 percent for the full year. Also, the margins are holding up well, and that is important going into the fourth quarter." GEOFF BLABER, CCS Insight: "Nokia's volume reflects the guidance it delivered at the start of September, but its performance in the Americas is particularly disappointing. We believe the company decided to sacrifice volumes for margin, and it would appear other players, notable Samsung, have extended their reach into lower-tier products." "Nokia's high-tier volumes appear to have been dented by the 'iPhone effect' having a detrimental effect on shipments of Nokia's smartphones." THOMAS LANGER, WEST LB "The share price going up is to a degree justifiable, but only to a degree. The top line was weak, EPS was steady. That was OK due to very good cost control. However, the cash flow generated during the quarter was below our estimates. "I'm not quite sure whether it's good or a bad thing that the company is not talking more about the overall macroeconomic picture. "They usually have a good effect in Q4 and usually take more market share during the Christmas season, so the point of the market share being slightly up is not so excellent. "When we look at cost control, that is the most positive point. "The report will be taken with a bit of relief because there was not much mention of the economic crisis, but people would want to know how the company is seeing the competitive environment and the outlook for 2009. "The Q3 results didn't fall off a cliff, but have put investors in limbo." HANNU RAUHALA, POHJOLA "The guidance was actually a relief taking the global economy situation into account. "The guidance came in line with Nokia's profit warning and better than feared. "The gross margin was a positive surprise." MARTTI LARJO, NORDEA "Nothing dramatic in the numbers, and the guidance was better than expected as there were a lot of fears about it." MICHAEL SCHRODER, GLITNIR "The reported sales numbers came in marginally lower than I had expected on all lines. Fourth-quarter industry volume guidance is relatively strong, but the Nokia market share guidance of sequentially flat or slightly up is somewhat disappointing. Overall neutral to slightly disappointing report." (Reporting by Helsinki and Stockholm Newsrooms; Editing by Will Waterman)
