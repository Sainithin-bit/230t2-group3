 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission should get more power to police credit derivatives even though it failed to use its existing authority to rein in risky behavior that contributed to a global financial crisis, a former SEC chief told Congress on Thursday. 

 Arthur Levitt, chairman of the SEC from 1993 to 2001, harshly criticized his former agency for falling down on the job in recent years. "As the markets needed more transparency, the SEC allowed opacity to reign," Levitt said in prepared testimony for a Senate Banking Committee hearing. "As an overheated market needed a strong referee to rein in dangerously risky behavior, the commission too often remained on the sidelines. However, the agency is the best-placed regulator to crack down on credit derivatives, credit rating agencies, investment banks and municipal markets, Levitt said, and should have more authority in those areas. Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat, said regulators, including the Federal Reserve, failed to adequately police the mortgage lending markets. "Our nation's financial regulators willfully ignored abuses taking place on their beat, choosing to embrace the same faulty assumptions that fueled the excessive risk-taking in the marketplace," Dodd said.
