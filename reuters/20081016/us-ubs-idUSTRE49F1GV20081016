 ZURICH  (Reuters) - UBS AG ( UBSN.VX ) will get a capital injection of 6 billion Swiss francs ($5.3 billion) from the government in the form of mandatory convertible notes, the Swiss bank said on Thursday. 

 UBS has also reached an agreement with the Swiss National Bank to transfer up $60 billion of currently illiquid securities and other assets from its balance sheet to a separate fund entity. "With this transaction, UBS caps future potential losses from these assets, secures their long-term funding, reduces its risk-weighted assets, and materially de-risks and reduces its balance sheet," UBS said in a statement.
