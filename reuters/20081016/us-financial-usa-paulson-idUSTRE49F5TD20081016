 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Thursday said that there were plenty of other banks interested in an equity injection under the government's $700 billion financial rescue plan. 

 "We got nine banks to sign up initially and we're going to be going out broadly. And you know, we have we have interest from a good number of other banks," he told Fox Business News in an interview. Paulson on Tuesday persuaded the country's nine largest banks to accept a total tax-payer equity injection of $125 billion to recapitalize the banking system and confront a global credit crisis.. "We took unprecedented actions on a case by case basis...now we're going to the heart of the problem. We're taking a systemic approach. These are bold actions. I'm confident they're the right actions," he said. (Reporting by  Alister Bull ; Editing by Theodore d'Afflisio)
