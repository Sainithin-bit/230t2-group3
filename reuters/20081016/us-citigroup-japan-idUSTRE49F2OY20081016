 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Citigroup ( C.N ) will delay a planned merger of two of its Japanese units, the Nikkei newspaper said on Thursday, the latest sign the subprime-hit U.S. bank is looking to trim costs from its Tokyo operations. 

 Separately, Citigroup's Japanese holding company said on Wednesday it would sell 91 percent of its stake in investment company Nikko Antfactory to investors including unlisted Norinchukin Bank and Mitsubishi Corp ( 8058.T ), a deal that was widely expected. Citigroup last year embarked on an aggressive push to expand in Japan, but has since been hit by heavy losses in the global credit crisis. Citigroup will delay its merger of brokerage Nikko Cordial Securities Inc and investment bank Nikko Citigroup Ltd, which it had expected to complete by March 2009, to concentrate on strengthening group revenues in Japan, the paper said. The U.S. bank decided to delay the merger due to the cost of integrating the two businesses, the Nikkei said. Another reason for the delay is that the retail brokerage, Nikko Cordial, is taking longer than expected to prepare for Japan's switch to electronic stock certificates next year, industry sources said. Nikko Citi Holdings, Citigroup's Japanese holding company, did not say in a statement whether it would delay the merger. The firm said it would announce details about the merger once they were decided. Nikko Citi said on Wednesday it had sold most its stake in Nikko Antfactory to Norinchukin, the central bank for Japan's agricultural cooperatives, and trading company Mitsubishi. The terms of the sale were not disclosed. Citigroup has recorded more than $58 billion of credit losses and writedowns in the past year and is laying off thousands of employees as it looks to cut expenses. Reuters reported on Wednesday the firm is also cutting its research staff globally, as it scales back the number of companies it covers by nearly 10 percent. Citigroup in June said it would all but close its consumer lending business in Japan, shutting down more than 30 outlets and 540 unmanned branches. It also offered early retirement to 1,350 employees of the unit. (Additional reporting by Emi Emoto; Editing by  Michael Watson )
