 (Reuters) - Louis Freeh, former head of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, was named as an examiner to conduct a bankruptcy court probe of energy trader SemGroup LP, court documents show. 

 Freeh's appointment was authorized by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware on Tuesday. SemGroup, the parent of SemGroup Energy Partners LP SGLP.O, collapsed in July after $3.2 billion in bad bets on oil prices. Its oil suppliers and main lender Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) have clashed over who has first priority claim on the company's assets. Freeh, who was chosen by the U.S. Trustee's office, will be looking at SemGroup's oil price trading. Creditors allege that SemGroup's trades fell outside the bounds of its normal hedging activity.
