 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The number of U.S. workers filing new claims for jobless benefits fell a far greater than expected 16,000 last week, government data showed on Thursday. 

 Initial claims for state unemployment insurance benefits declined to a seasonally adjusted 461,000 in the week ended October 11 from a revised 477,000 the prior week, the Labor Department said. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected new claims to fall to 475,000 from an initially reported 478,000 the prior week. A Labor Department spokesman noted that because of Monday's federal holiday, data from several jurisdictions was estimated and may have affected the data. The 4-week moving average of claims, considered a better gauge of employment trends because it irons out weekly fluctuations, rose to 483,250 from 482,500 the prior week. It was the highest level since the week of October 20, 2001, in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. The number of people remaining on the benefits roll after drawing an initial week of aid rose 40,000 to 3.711 million in the week ended October 4, the most recent data available. It was the highest since June 2003. (Reporting by  Mark Felsenthal , Editing by Andrea Ricci)
