 KIEV  (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund may lend Ukraine a sum ranging up to $14 billion to shore up its financial system, but made any credit contingent on calling off a snap election, Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko said on Thursday. 

 In Washington, however, the IMF denied any aid to the Eastern European country would be linked to the poll. "IMF support for Ukraine is not contingent on an election timetable," said IMF spokesman Bill Murray. Political woes in Ukraine, which faces its third parliamentary poll in as many years, have been compounded by fears that government and banks may not be able to refinance debt as its currency weakens and global lending dries up. IMF officials arrived Wednesday to discuss how it could help cushion the impact of the global financial crisis. It has also been approached for aid by Iceland, Hungary and Serbia. "We have information today that the International Monetary (Fund) is ready to examine special credits from $3-14 billion to stabilize the financial system," Tymoshenko told a news conference after a cabinet meeting. "At the same time, the IMF said it finds it very difficult to talk with Ukraine amid all these proposals for an early election." "Let me stress that in order to receive this standby credit needed to stabilize the currency and financial system, it is vital to postpone the election. The IMF also said this," she said. Ukraine has so far avoided direct blows to its economy from the global financial crisis, but the hryvnia currency fell when investors rushed out of emerging assets and scrambled for dollars. It hit an all-time low last week of 5.9 to the dollar. The central bank has a difficult balancing act -- letting the hryvnia weaken under the weight of the current account gap would take away one of the few constants in a country gripped by political turbulence since the "Orange Revolution" of 2004. Propping it up would deplete hard currency reserves which now amount to the equivalent of $37.5 billion. Authorities are also keen to calm depositors' fears after speculation of a takeover deal led to a run on Ukraine's sixth largest bank, Prominvest. POLITICAL BATTLES The central bank's First Deputy Chairman, Anatoly Shapovalov, said the size of the credit from the IMF would depend on Ukraine's quota subscription in the Fund. "At the moment, we do not need these funds, but who can say how the global crisis will develop tomorrow?" he said. Another central bank official declining to be identified said Ukraine's quota was the equivalent of $2 billion and that countries can receive three to five times their quota -- amounting to a total of $6 billion to $10 billion. The rest could come from other international organizations. Ukraine has become accustomed to political turmoil since Yushchenko came to power seeking NATO and European Union membership. But its economy had been growing at about 7 percent annually. Now growth is expected to slow substantially -- the IMF says to 2.5 percent next year from 6.4 percent this year. Tymoshenko, the president's estranged ally, restated her opposition to the December 7 poll, called after Yushchenko blamed her for breaking up the government and dissolved parliament. Citing the background of the financial crisis, Tymoshenko offered to accept "any conditions" to persuade the president to call off the election. Her allies have launched court action suspending preparations for the vote. Analysts in Ukraine saw her comments as yet another political maneuver in her standoff with Yushchenko. "If Tymoshenko secures IMF support, it will be a very strong argument for the political elite, for people in the know," said Oleksander Dergachyov, an independent political analyst. "If she doesn't get it, Yushchenko will look the guilty party. Her argument allows her to get the support of business."
