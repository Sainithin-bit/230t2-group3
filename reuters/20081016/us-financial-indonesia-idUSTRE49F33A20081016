 JAKARTA  (Reuters) - Indonesia has issued a new ruling to make it clearer what government and central bank officials can and can not do when dealing with market crises, including how to handle the bail out of troubled banks. 

 Some analysts have said officials would be reluctant to take tough decisions to tackle the global financial crisis for fear that they could subsequently face prosecution and jail because of murky regulations. Scores of central bank officials have been questioned by the attorney general's office in the past decade over their handling of the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis -- in particular, on a decision, controversial at the time, to extend billions of dollars in emergency liquidity to troubled commercial banks. The new ruling is expected to give "a stronger legal basis for decision-makers and give clear guidelines to every party involved in handling a crisis," Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati told a news conference. Indonesia has responded to the current global financial crisis with measures ranging from greater protection for bank deposits to efforts to improve liquidity and avoid a credit crunch. The central bank has intervened in currency markets to support the rupiah. The new ruling would spell out more clearly what kinds of emergency decisions government and central bank officials can take to try to avoid some of the mistakes and subsequent backlash the country experienced a decade ago. Southeast Asia's biggest economy was hard hit by the 1997-98 crisis, when former dictator President Suharto attracted widespread criticism for his handling of the financial meltdown. "Anything can happen right now, even in countries as powerful as the U.S.," Boediono, governor of Bank Indonesia, the central bank, told reporters. Europe and the United States have announced multi-billion dollar plans to inject capital into their banks to try to restore confidence following the financial storm unleashed by the collapse of investment bank Lehman Brothers last month. Various measures announced globally to tackle the crisis add up to more than $3 trillion. "We should be better prepared with the guidelines. Our banking sector, however, is still solid now," Boediono said. His predecessor, Burhanuddin Abdullah, is one example of an official caught up in regulatory uncertainty in Indonesia. He is on trial for his alleged role in a scandal whereby a foundation linked to Bank Indonesia was used to pay for legal representation for central bank officials involved in the liquidity payments to banks during the Asian crisis. Abdullah has denied any wrongdoing. Indonesia stocks dropped 3.76 percent on Thursday, falling in line with regional markets, which tumbled on fears of widespread recession. The rupiah fell almost 1 percent to 9,860 per dollar, bringing total losses so far this year to around 5 percent. The government already has a tough task balancing economic growth, double-digit inflation, and slowing demand for its commodities and manufactured goods. Apart from murky regulations, analysts have said that government may be reluctant to take tough action to combat the crisis for fear of turning voters against them in parliamentary and presidential elections due next year. One aspect of the new regulations means the government could offer incentives to investors interested in turning around troubled banks, the finance minister said. "If the solution by the private sector leads to less burden in terms of costs and economic risk, the government and Bank Indonesia could offer incentives and provide facilities for the process," Indrawati said. Earlier this week, the government raised guaranteed bank deposits twenty-fold to 2 billion rupiah ($202,800). ($1=9,860 Rupiah) (Writing by Gde Anugrah Arka; Editing by  Sara Webb )
