 SHANGHAI  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp.'s ( GM.N ) chief executive officer Rick Wagoner told reporters on Monday that he expected the company's global output volume to be roughly similar to last year's. 

 The president of GM's Asia-Pacific operations, Nick Reilly, told Reuters that the company expected to remain the biggest foreign seller of autos in China this year. The company first achieved that position last year. GM has two vehicle manufacturing joint ventures in China making cars and minivans.
