 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal took the reins at Arcelor Mittal CELR.PA ( ISPA.AS ) on Monday, replacing an Arcelor man at the top just four months after a $33 billion merger to form the combined group. 

 The world's largest steelmaker, still in the process of being formed, also reported third-quarter figures, showing pro-forma core profit slightly ahead of expectations, and confirmed its guidance for the full year. Mittal Steel ( MT.N ), which took over Luxembourg's Arcelor after a ferocious battle of words, had pledged to keep an Arcelor man as chief executive following the merger of the two groups in a bid to calm political opposition to the deal. Arcelor Mittal said in a statement on Monday that the board of directors had unanimously appointed Lakshmi Mittal as the new chief to replace Roland Junck of Arcelor, who would remain a member of the group management board. "We are making these changes to clarify the leadership of the company. It had become clear over the past months that the interests of the company were not best served by the previous structure," said Joseph Kinsch, chairman of the board, who had been a leading Arcelor figure resisting Mittal's advances. The move, which will also add Lakshmi Mittal to the group management board and take effect immediately, will be put to the group's shareholders for a vote in which the Mittal family will not participate. The takeover battle for Arcelor by Mittal ended in late June and by the end of August Mittal Steel held 93.7 percent of Arcelor's shares. The merger should be completed in April or May next year, Kinsch said. Mittal shares dipped 1.0 percent to 32.67 euros by 1150 GMT after the news. The Dow Jones European base resources index .SXPP was up 0.9 percent at the time. MOVE EXPECTED A London-based analyst, who declined to be named, said it was no great surprise. "Pretty much everyone knew who the leader of the group was. The chief has not really changed. But why let investors, especially French investors wait until now? It was always going to be the case," he said. Colette Neuville, head of the Adam minority shareholder group, said it was a shame Mittal had not said from the start that he would head the group. "But it doesn't pose a problem as long as there are effective checks and balances in the company and that for example board members play their role fully," she said. Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker told local radio he took note of Junck's resignation with "extreme regret". The company will remain headquartered in Luxembourg. Lakshmi Mittal had been a non-executive president of the group and was due to succeed Kinsch as chairman when the latter retired. Mittal had always been the figurehead of the merging group. Junck, a low profile Arcelor executive, had given few interviews in his brief period in charge. Arcelor Mittal said EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) amounted to $4.35 billion, compared with the average forecast of $4.29 billion from a poll of seven analysts by Reuters. "The anticipated low seasonal volume was offset by a strong rise in steel prices... Looking ahead, we are on track to deliver guidance for the full year," Chief Financial Officer Aditya Mittal said in a statement. Third-quarter sales amounted to $22.1 billion compared with the average forecast from the poll of $23.07 billion. Arcelor Mittal said the integration of the two groups was progressing well. "Due to planned production cut-backs in European and American operations, the company expects fourth quarter EBITDA to be below third quarter levels," it said, adding 2006 EBITDA should be in line with expectations at $15.2-15.4 billion. The company also put the total price of the takeover of Arcelor at $33.4 billion. (Additional reporting by  Philip Blenkinsop , Julien Ponthus in Brussels, Michele Sinner in Luxembourg)
