 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - The merger of Arcelor CELR.PA and Mittal ( ISPA.AS ) to create a global steel giant should be completed in April or May next year, its chairman said on Monday. 

 "We are continuing to work very hard on the preparation of the merger of the two companies and we hope that we can finish this work, let's say, at the end of April or May of next year," Chairman Joseph Kinsch told a telephone news conference. "At that time we will have in fact the real, from a legal point of view, Arcelor Mittal company."
