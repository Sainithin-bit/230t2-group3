 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Boston Scientific Corp. ( BSX.N ) on Monday said patients given its Taxus drug-coated stent had no greater risk of death or heart attack than those receiving a bare-metal device, despite a small but significant risk of developing dangerous blood clots with Taxus. 

 Donald Baim, the company's new chief medical and scientific officer, said analysis of long-term stent data showed the danger of late stent thrombosis, or blood clots, seen with Taxus was offset by the risk of restenosis, or reclogging of cleared arteries, with the older, cheaper bare metal stents and the need for repeat procedures. "Restenosis in bare metal stents is not just a benign nuisance," Baim said at a meeting with analysts in Boston, noting a significant increase in heart attacks and death that can occur with revascularization procedures. Stents are tiny mesh tubes used to prop open arteries that have been cleared of plaque. Drug-coated stents have become a $5 billion a year market because of their ability to prevent the build-up of scar tissue. The incidence of blood clots seen with the increasingly popular drug-coated stents has raised concern among physicians and health officials, leading some to take a second look at the older bare-metal stents as an alternative. But Baim said a reanalysis of data from more than 3,400 patients through four years showed that the chances of death or heart attack are not only small, but equivalent or less with Taxus versus bare metal stents. "Given that the risk is equal in terms of death and MI (heart attack), the overwhelming benefit is a reduction in number of revascularizations by 50 percent with Taxus compared with bare metal stents," Baim said. "Restenosis and repeat procedures can also cause major complications and Taxus prevents them," he added. Baim noted that Taxus patients should take the blood clot preventer Plavix for at least six months and possibly longer, adding that prematurely stopping Plavix can increase stent thrombosis. Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ.N ), whose Cypher stent competes directly with Taxus, has said it sees no statistically significant risk of late thrombosis with its device. But Boston Scientific said data show Taxus and Cypher have similar blood clot risks. "Clinically, scientifically, mechanistically, I have little doubt that both of these stents have a similar late stent thrombosis pattern," Baim said. (Additional reporting by  Ben Hirschler )
