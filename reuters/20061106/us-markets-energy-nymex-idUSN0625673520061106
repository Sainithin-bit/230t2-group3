 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil prices were hovering to the firm side in choppy electronic trading Monday morning as traders weighed turmoil in Nigeria threatening output there while waiting for signs OPEC will implement its recent production cut. 

 "We're caught in a range recently and, with the possibility of more disruption of Nigerian production out there, along with skepticism about OPEC's ability to implement cuts, we're just waiting for something to break out of the range," said Mike Fitzpatrick, vice president, energy risk management, at Fimat USA. At 9:50 a.m. EST (1450 GMT), December crude CLZ6 on the New York Mercantile Exchange was up 3 cents, or 0.05 percent, at $59.17 per barrel, trading from $58.50 to $59.30. In London, ICE December Brent crude LCOZ6 was up 15 cents, or 0.25 percent, at $59.30 a barrel, trading from $58.49 to $59.40. Crude oil futures rose more than $1 to end above $59 Friday amid concern that Nigerian militants might attack oil facilities and news of a bomb threat against BP Plc's refinery in Indiana. OPEC President Edmund Daukoru, also Nigeria's oil minister, said on Monday oil markets may not feel the effects of OPEC's recent production cut of 1.2 million barrels per day until later this month and restated another cut may be needed. Analysts have expressed skepticism that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will cut the full amount. So far, only buyers of crude from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Algeria have confirmed those three members have made cuts totaling more than 500,000 bpd. Daukoru insisted the latest violence in Nigeria was a social rather than political issue and that a Briton and an American kidnapped in the area would be released soon. The two were kidnapped from an oil industry ship off the southern Nigerian state of Bayelsa, one of Nigeria's top oil producing states. On Monday suspected militants invaded an oil production facility operated by Italian oil company Agip at Tebidaba in southern Nigeria, a government official said.  Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi said on Monday very low oil prices were not sustainable and could lead to price volatility. "Prices must be high enough to offer an adequate return to producers without hurting consumers," Naimi said in a speech in Islamabad. A copy was made available to Reuters in Dubai.  In the U.S. Northeast, which uses the bulk of the nation's heating oil, temperatures averaged 5 to 10 degrees (3-5 C) below normal during the past 3 days, according to private forecaster DTN Meteorlogix. But there will be normal temperatures on Monday, and above normal through Friday.  Oil dealers have watched as crude was unable to break out of a range between the 2006 low of $56.55 hit October 20 and the October 26 high of $61.79. Markets will also eye Wednesday's fresh snapshot of U.S. oil inventories, after last week's data showed crude supply rebounded, along with imports, after slumping in the previous week's data. Crude oil, refined products, and natural gas storage all sit well above year-ago levels. On Monday morning, NYMEX December RBOB RBZ6 was near flat, down 0.07 cent, or 0.05 percent, at $1.5250. December gasoline HUZ6 was down 0.14 cent, or 0.09 percent, at $1.5055 per gallon. December heating oil HOZ6 was up 1.25 cents or 0.75 percent at $1.69 per gallon. TECHNICALS December crude CLZ6 resistance was expected at $59.00. Support was pegged at $58.00. December RBOB RBZ6 resistance remained pegged at $1.55, with support slated at $1.45. Heating oil's resistance was slotted at $1.70. Support lies at $1.62. The crack spread CL-HO1=R was at $11.7720. Gasoline resistance was put at $1.55. Support was pegged at $1.45. The crack spread CL-HU1=R was at $4303.78.
