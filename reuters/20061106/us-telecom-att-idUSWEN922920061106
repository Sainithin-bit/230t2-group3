 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - AT&T Inc. ( T.N ) said on Monday that AT&T Services Inc. had amended a lawsuit filed in federal court in Texas to name seven suspected defendants whom the company claims accessed customer information without authorization. 

 The group of defendants, which include individuals and companies, are accused of pretexting, in which data brokers, investigators or others pose as the customer in order to gain confidential information.
