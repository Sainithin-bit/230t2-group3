 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Trucking company Swift Transportation Co. Inc. SWFT.O has received a $29-per-share buyout bid from its largest shareholder, former Chief Executive Jerry Moyes, the company said on Monday. 

 In its quarterly earnings report on October 25, Swift reported 75.9 million shares outstanding, making the takeover offer worth about $2.2 billion. The shares rose above the offer price in Nasdaq trade -- jumping 24 percent to $29.80. Analysts said the bid may undervalue the company because trucking company stocks have been hurt in recent months by fears of a U.S. economic slowdown. Phoenix-based Swift, which operates a fleet of about 18,000 tractors and 52,000 trailers from a network of more than 30 terminals, said its board has set up a special committee to evaluate the offer. In a letter to the board, Moyes, currently a director, said he has received a written commitment from Morgan Stanley to provide all necessary debt financing for the deal. "Given Swift's recent performance, $29.00 per share is a full and fair price for Swift's common stock," Moyes wrote in his letter, dated November 3, "providing an attractive opportunity for its stockholders to maximize the value of their investment in Swift." Moyes added that he could be persuaded to go higher than $29 a share. "I am prepared to consider any factors that you believe justify a higher purchase price, and, upon completion of due diligence, I may be willing to increase my proposed price," he wrote. In a research note, UBS transportation analyst Rick Paterson wrote that this "clearly leaves the door open for a premium above" the current offer. Swift's board has until November 20 to consider the offer, Moyes wrote in his letter. Moyes told Reuters in a telephone interview on Monday that he will "pull the offer" after November 20, but did not say what his next step would be if his bid is rejected. "I encourage shareholders to look at this fair offer seriously," he said. Swift is currently working its way through a program to boost its bottom line and improve its services. Some analysts say a higher offer price may come. "We believe the deal may require a higher premium, given depressed valuations of the group and given that Swift continues to successfully execute on its turnaround," R.W Baird & Co. analyst Jon Langenfeld wrote in a research note. "We remain neutral on the truckers (including Swift) but recognize this proposal will aid investor sentiment for the broader trucking group," he added. Langenfeld wrote that the potential upside that the bid brings may boost trucking outfits J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc. ( JBHT.O ), Heartland Express Inc. ( HTLD.O ) and Con-way Inc.  ( CNW.N ). Paterson of UBS wrote, "We see Swift as a long-term margin story and have every confidence that it would be able to attain a fair market value of $29 a share without a takeover." "Therefore the offer from ... Moyes essentially represents a timing issue and opportunity for investors to realize those gains earlier," he added.
