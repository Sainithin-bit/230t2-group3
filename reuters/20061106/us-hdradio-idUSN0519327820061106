 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. radio operators on Monday said sales of its high-definition radios will expand to Circuit City CC.N, and stations are set to air some 75,000 ads a week pushing HD Digital radio, in an effort to defend its turf against satellite radio and iPods. 

 In the latest phase of a $200 million marketing push, timed to take advantage of the holiday season, the radio industry starting November 13 will also cut prices, bringing some automotive units to around $150, according to the HD Digital Radio Alliance, a group of broadcasters hoping to speed consumer adoption of HD Digital Radio. Along with its arrival at "big-box retailer" Circuit City, the radios will also be found in additional RadioShack ( RSH.N ) locations, where they had been selling in selected regions. The moves comes at a time when holiday shoppers may already be checking off lists for other digital music players, such as new versions of Apple Computer Inc.'s ( AAPL.O ) Inc.'s iPod, recently discounted models of Sandisk's Sansa or Microsoft's Zune, which will debut later this month. A consumer who buys or owns an iPod may still take interest in HD radio, which receives over-the-air terrestrial stations with CD-quality sound and multiple new-program formats, says Peter Ferrara, chief executive of the HD Digital Radio Alliance. He said radio listeners, who have already simultaneously owned CD players, cassette players and iPods, are comfortable using more than one system. "I don't want to set any false expectation that this will be the 'HD Radio Christmas' -- we don't think that is the case. But I think we have a foot well in the door right now," he told Reuters in an interview. Shoppers who listen to traditional radio will be hard pressed to miss on-air ads for HD radio, since many stations will air 150 commercials per week. The stakes remain high for traditional radio, which has lost listeners tuning into commercial-free options offered by satellite radio or digital music players that can store hundreds of songs that consumers chose themselves. Indeed after buying one of those other items, they may not desire spending more on radio, which is often seen as a free commodity. Ferrara said the industry is optimistic and has seen solid return for its $200 million marketing investment in HD digital radio. Ferrara, who in August said some 100,000 units had been sold, declined to update the total number of radio sold during the course of the 10-month push. However, he said he remains optimistic that more and more, HD radio technology will become standard, and that a wave of sales to consumers replacing older radios -- from alarm clock radios to car radios -- is due in 2007 and 2008. "I think we are still in the early stages of the adoption curve and the understanding of the technology by the consumer," he said. "There are ... about 70 to 80 million AM/FM radios sold each year in the U.S. We will get in (that) roll as more products become available, and as the technology becomes easier to purchase because of the price point and the availability."
