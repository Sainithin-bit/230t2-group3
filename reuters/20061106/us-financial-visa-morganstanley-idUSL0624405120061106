 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Visa Europe and Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) have settled an antitrust dispute over access to Visa's credit card network that could lead to the end of a European Commission probe into Visa, the Financial Times said on Monday. 

 The paper said Visa had denied Morgan Stanley access to its network because the U.S. investment bank runs the Discover card in the United States to compete with Visa. That refusal triggered a complaint by Morgan Stanley to the European Union's top competition regulator, which charged Visa in August 2004 with abusing a dominant market position. Citing executives from both groups, the paper said that Morgan Stanley had withdrawn its complaint after Visa allowed it to join the card network. If the Commission in turn stopped its investigation Visa Europe would no longer face a potential fine of up to 10 percent of its global annual turnover, the paper said. A European Commission spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment.
