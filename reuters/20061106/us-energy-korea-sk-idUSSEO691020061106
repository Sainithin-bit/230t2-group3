 SEOUL  (Reuters) - SK Corp. ( 003600.KS ), South Korea's top refiner, is seeking to raise as much as $700 million in a London IPO of its SK Incheon Oil refinery, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday. 

 SK Corp. had opted for a London listing later this year because South Korean regulations forbid a company from listing a year after it has posted an annual net loss, the newspaper quoted people familiar with the situation as saying. It did not mention how much of the 275,000 barrel-a-day (bpd) business SK Corp. planned to offer. Merrill Lynch, which confirmed it had been picked as the underwriter for the IPO, declined to comment further, while an SK Corp. spokeswoman said it was considering various options about selling its stakes in SK Incheon. SK Corp. said on October 27 it was considering selling part of its 90.63 percent stake in SK Incheon as part of its effort to pay off debt. In December 2005, SK Corp. signed a final deal to pay about $1.6 billion for the stake and acquired about $1.4 billion of its debt. SK bought Incheon, formerly known by a different spelling as Inchon Oil Refinery Co. Ltd., as part of an expansion drive targeting export markets such as energy-hungry China. SK Incheon is based in Inchon, the western port city of South Korea, which is closer to China than other local refiners. SK Incheon Oil posted a 170 billion won ($180.4 million) net loss on sales of 3.55 trillion won in 2005. ($1=942.3 Won)
