 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - Dutch food retailer Ahold ( AHLN.AS )AHO.N will continue to review its retail stores as it restructures by divesting businesses and cutting costs, chief executive Anders Moberg said on Monday. 

 "We need to operate at a lower cost level, reduce costs across the company," Moberg told reporters at a news conference, "we will review underperforming stores on an ongoing basis." Ahold announced earlier that it will divest its U.S. Foodservice business and reduce operating costs by 500 million euros ($635.7 million) by the end of 2009. The company, the world's fourth-biggest food retail and foodservice group by sales, is struggling to get back on track after an accounting scandal in 2003 centered on U.S. Foodservice, its catering supplies business.
