 LONDON  (Reuters) - Wall Street stocks were expected to claw back up on Monday after the Dow registered its longest losing streak in a year, but the tone remains cautious ahead of U.S. mid-term elections and lingering economic slowdown concerns. 

 Oil majors were likely to be in focus as crude oil CLc1 traded below $59 a barrel, while there was expected to be little market reaction to the court ruling sentencing ousted Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein to hang. By 1114 GMT, U.S. stock futures were pointing to opening up 0.4 percent for the three main indexes SPc1 DJc1 NDc1. "It seems the third-quarter results themselves were excellent, so that's definitely a positive surprise. That could make people a little bit more optimistic for the future," said Johan Van Der Biest, a fund manager at Dexia. "Certainly important is the mid-term elections tomorrow. If the Democrats win a majority in the House and the Senate, that could have an impact on the market." U.S. stocks fell on Friday, with the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  suffering its longest losing streak in more than a year, as jobs data showing strength in the economy raised worries the Federal Reserve may resume raising interest rates. The Dow fell 0.3 percent, to end at 11,986.04. The S&P500 Index  .SPX  slipped 0.2 percent and Nasdaq  .IXIC  fell 0.1 percent. Historically, the U.S. mid-term elections have been bullish for the stock market, according to the Stock Trader's Almanac. But politically sensitive stocks could experience some volatility on Tuesday, when U.S. voters go to the polls, and on Wednesday as traders digest election results. HEAVYWEIGHTS REPORT No major economic news was scheduled for release on Monday when El Paso EP.N and Fluor Corp ( FLR.N ) were among major U.S. corporates reporting earnings. Andarko ( APC.N ) was also due to report on Monday. Norway's Statoil ( STL.OL ) said it has agreed to buy some stakes in Gulf of Mexico deepwater oil discoveries and prospects from the U.S. company for $901 million. In other news, the Wall Street Journal reported General Motors ( GM.N ) said a deal over GM's contribution on labor costs at auto-parts maker Delphi Corp. DPHIQ.PK could be reached "reasonably soon" and cost GM $6 billion to $7.5 billion. The newspaper also said Merrill Lynch's MER.N private equity arm has received a request for information from the U.S. Justice Department as part of its informal inquiry into anti-competitive behavior in the private equity sector. Meanwhile financial weekly Barron's said consumer and commercial finance company CIT Group Inc's ( CIT.N ) stock could jump if the company decides to spin off its aircraft-leasing business. Barron's also said General Electric Co. ( GE.N ) is a favorite pick of major money managers, some of whom see the shares rising as much as 30 percent in the coming months. However, Web search leader Google Inc. ( GOOG.O ) and automaker General Motors Corp.( GM.N ) were named as the market's most overvalued shares in its Big Money poll.
