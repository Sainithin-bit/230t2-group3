 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - Natural gas producer and pipeline company El Paso Corp. EP.N said on Monday it swung to a third-quarter profit from a year-ago loss, but warned it would miss its full-year output target. 

 Natural gas production for the year would likely average between 790 million to 800 million cubic feet a day (cfd), short of its previous forecast of 825 million cfd. Growth of reserves was also likely to miss the targeted growth of 5 to 10 percent, Chief Executive Officer Doug Foshee told a conference call, although the year-end evaluation of the assets had just begun. Shares in the company fell about 2.5 percent to $13.56 per share versus a 0.6 percent gain in the broader Standard & Poor's Energy index. The company posted a profit of $126 million, or 18 cents per share, versus a loss of $321 million, or 50 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter, beating the average analysts' expectation of 17 cents per share. Boosting the quarterly earnings was a $48 million pretax gain on the mark-to-market value of contracts that El Paso said it used to hedge its natural gas and crude oil production. Revenues rose to $1.06 billion from $752 million a year ago. GULF WOES Problems in the Gulf of Mexico hurt the production unit, Foshee said, where the company has pushed back some expected output to next year. "Whereas back in August we expected 65 to 100 million (cubic feet) a day to come on in the Gulf of Mexico by year-end, we now expect 30 million a day plus," he said. The company expects to reach year-end output per day of 830 million to 850 million cfd, with another 40 million cfd expected to come on line in early 2007, he added. Exploration and production earnings fell to $141 million from $169 million a year ago as average output excluding affiliates' volume rose to 744 million cfd from 736 million cfd. However, realized prices for natural gas fell to $6.30 per thousand cubic feet versus $6.40 a year ago, and costs rose to $1.95 per thousand cubic feet from $1.74. Earnings from the company's pipeline operations rose to $305 million from $272 million, driven by higher rates, capacity sales and new projects.
