 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - Dutch retailer Ahold ( AHLN.AS )AHO.N is expected to announce a wide-ranging overhaul of its business on Monday that may include the sale of underperforming assets and cost cuts. 

 Ahold has been struggling to boost profitability and recover from an accounting scandal as hedge funds Centaurus Capital and Paulson & Co., which together own about 6.4 percent of the retailer, are pushing it to sell its flagging U.S. activities, including its U.S. Foodservice unit. Ahold, the world's fourth-biggest food retail and foodservice group in terms of sales, has refused to meet with the funds until it completes its review, which will be detailed in an 1145 GMT announcement, followed by a news conference. Ahold shares were trading 0.48 percent up at 8.39 euros at 0921 GMT, outperforming a 0.1 percent rise in the DJ Stoxx retail index .SXRP, as investors waited for news of its long-anticipated retail review. "The market is expecting the sale of U.S. Foodservice. It is not illogical as it is not really a retail business. Downside risks are very limited for Ahold as speculation on a merger or more drastic action will remain whatever it does," said Lex Boumeester, a trader at Delta Lloyd. Buoyed by merger and asset disposal talk, Ahold shares have gained 32 percent since the start of the year versus a 23.6 percent increase in the DJ Stoxx retail index. The stock trades at 17 times estimated 2006 earnings against France's Carrefour ( CARR.PA ) at 18 times. Analysts said selling off assets, especially U.S. Foodservice, followed by a share buyback, could help Ahold to regain an investment-grade credit rating and pave the way for the return of dividends for shareholders. The U.S. Foodservice business, which sells catering supplies, had 14.87 billion euros ($19 billion) in 2005 sales, one-third of the group's revenues, but has few synergies with Ahold's core food retail business. Some private equity firms, including Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (which bought Ahold's Stop & Shop chain) and Cerberus Capital Management are interested in the U.S. Foodservice business, a source familiar with the matter said last week. A slimmed-down Ahold would also find it easier to merge with Belgian rival Delhaize DELBt.BR, which has a market value about half of the Dutch group's, analysts have said. Ahold also has a retail presence in the United States with combined 2005 sales of 18.15 billion euros, or 41 percent of the total, but is facing stiff competition from U.S. retailers such as Kroger Co. ( KR.N ) and Safeway Inc. ( SWY.N ). Few expect Ahold to dispose of its core Albert Heijn unit in the Netherlands, one of its most profitable supermarket units, but lossmaking operations in Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia are considered prime targets for disposal.
