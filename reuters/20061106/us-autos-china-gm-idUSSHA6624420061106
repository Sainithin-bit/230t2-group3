 SHANGHAI  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) Chief Executive Rick Wagoner said on Monday that he expected the U.S. company's global output this year to roughly match 2005, with sales largely overseas. 

 In 2005, the world's largest automaker saw the majority of its sales and production generated outside the United States for the first time, Wagoner said, adding that the trend should persist over the next decade. "Last year, we produced about 9.2 million units globally, and I would suspect that this year we will end up with the same number of vehicles," Wagoner said. He is in Shanghai to start a tour of the firm's facilities. The Detroit-based company, which lost $10.6 billion last year, is in the process of restructuring and plans to slash more than 34,000 jobs and close 12 plants. It is also selling a controlling state in its finance arm GMAC to shore up its capital base. Wagoner said in August that the $14 billion sale to an investor consortium, led by hedge fund Cerberus Capital Management, could hopefully be concluded before the end of the year. He stuck to that target on Monday, adding that his company would end up owning 49 percent of GMAC and Cerberus the remaining 51 percent. While conceding market share to Asian rivals such as Toyota Motor Corp. ( 7203.T ) and Honda Motor ( 7267.T ), GM has been making headway in China -- the world's second-largest auto market -- outpacing Volkswagen AG ( VOWG.DE ) as the top foreign auto seller for the first time in 2005. Nick Reilly, president of GM's Asia-Pacific operations, told Reuters that the U.S. giant would remain the top player in that country in 2006 and that it was working hard to retain the position in coming years. GM has two vehicle manufacturing joint ventures in China making cars and minivans. Sales jumped 37 percent to 645,680 vehicles in the January-September period, beating 25 percent growth in the overall market. Growth should keep outpacing the market in coming years, Reilly said, adding the company will keep investing there despite cost-cutting initiatives in North America and elsewhere. "There will be substantial investment in China. We will invest in new plant facilities, powertrains and new products," he said.
