 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Northeast Utilities ( NU.N ) on Monday said it swung to a third-quarter profit, mainly due to the absence of divestiture charges that weighed on year-ago results. 

 The New England power company posted a profit in the third quarter of $111.5 million, or 72 cents per share, compared with a loss of $94.5 million, or 73 cents per share, a year earlier. The company reiterated its full-year earnings target of $1.57 to $1.70 per share for its regulated business and parent company. The company did not provide a 2006 earnings estimate for its competitive business, which it continues to exit. For 2007, the company expects to earn $1.30 to $1.55 per share. Going forward, the company expects earnings per share to grow between 10 percent and 14 percent annually, largely driven by capital investments in its regulated businesses. Northeast expects to spend $925 million on capital expenditures for 2006 and nearly $4.9 billion from 2007 to 2011, including some $1.2 billion in 2007. "We have substantially exited our competitive businesses and are building much of the energy infrastructure New England needs," Chief Executive Charles Shivery said in a statement.
