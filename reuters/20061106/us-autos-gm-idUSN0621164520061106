 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - General Motors ( GM.N ) Corp. Chief Executive Rick Wagoner said that a deal over GM's contribution on labor costs at auto-parts maker Delphi Corp. DPHIQ.PK could be reached "reasonably soon" and end up costing GM between $6 billion to $7.5 billion, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday. 

 Wagoner said in an interview Monday with The Wall Street Journal, during a trip to China, that "a huge amount of progress has been made" toward a deal, but that "some issues remain". Wagoner said he expects the cost to GM to be at the "lower end" of the $6 billion to $7.5 billion range, the Journal reported. GM has already booked $6 billion in charges in expectation of a deal. Separately, Wagoner told reporters on Monday that he expected the company's global output volume to be roughly similar to last year's. The president of GM's Asia-Pacific operations, Nick Reilly, told Reuters that the company expected to remain the biggest foreign seller of autos in China this year.
