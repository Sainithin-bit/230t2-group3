 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley Smith Barney ( MS.N ) hired a pair of top financial advisers from UBS, and also added advisers from Barclays Wealth to focus on Latin American markets. 

 Shannon Brightman and Steve Peet joined the company's Park Avenue, New York City office last Friday. Peet spent a decade at UBS, while Brightman spent four years at the company, according to FINRA filings. The pair previously oversaw $151 million in client assets and generated $1.2 million in annual fees and commissions. A Morgan Stanley spokeswoman confirmed the hirings. Morgan Stanley's Private Wealth Management division, which caters to clients with at least $20 million in investable assets, has hired Luis Miguel Gonzalez Ocque and Alan Shlesinger, to join the company's Miami office, according to the company. The team comes from Barclays Wealth, a division of Barclays PLC ( BARC.L ), and will focus on wealthy clients in Venezuela and Colombia. (Reporting by Helen Kearney; Editing by  Richard Chang )
