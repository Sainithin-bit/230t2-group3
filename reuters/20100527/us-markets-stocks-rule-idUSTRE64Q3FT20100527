 NEW YORK (Reuters) -The New York Stock Exchange invoked a rule on Thursday to smooth trading at the open as stock index futures rose sharply, signaling a possible volatile start to trading in the cash market. 

 The exchange's "rule 48" gives it the ability to bypass price indication requirements that help determine the floor price at the open during regular sessions, speeding the beginning of trading. (Reporting by  Edward Krudy ; Editing by  Padraic Cassidy )
