 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Warren Buffett said on Monday it's "very, very unlikely" he would bid for Dow Jones & Co. Inc. DJ.N as a personal investment, though he said the publisher of the Wall Street Journal has an appeal beyond economics. 

 Buffett, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. ( BRKa.N ), said his company couldn't bid for Dow Jones because the price is too high. "I couldn't do it for Berkshire," Buffett said during an interview on the business news channel CNBC. Buffett acknowledged that deep-pocketed investors around the world are salivating at the prospect of owning the Wall Street Journal as part of an acquisition of Dow Jones. But News Corp. NWSa.N Chairman Rupert Murdoch has set the bar high for Dow Jones, offering about a 50 percent premium for the company.
