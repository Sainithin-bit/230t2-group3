 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Macquarie Bank Ltd. MBL.AX raised its offer for Australian energy infrastructure firm Alinta Ltd. AAN.AX to at least A$7.9 billion ($6.5 billion) on Monday, to trump rival Babcock & Brown Ltd.'s BNB.AX recommended offer. 

 Macquarie's first A$15.45 a share bid was rejected by the Alinta board in March in favor of Babcock's lower A$7.4 billion cash and stock proposal, because of reservations about the value of Macquarie's offer of shares in a new company. Macquarie said in a statement on Monday its revised takeover proposal to Alinta gives shareholders three options: all cash, all shares or a combination. The bank also said it would make an unspecified equity commitment. A source familiar with the situation has said that some options in Macquarie's revised bid, submitted late on Friday, amounted to more than A$16 a share. Analysts said Macquarie's all-cash option would probably be in the range of A$15.50 a share, while its cash and scrip option would top A$16 per share. "Both bidders are putting in very full prices...considering Alinta has fairly low yield multiple compared to other utilities," said Credit Suisse analyst David Le Carpentier. "But it is quite rare that you get an opportunity like this to achieve massive scale in the market overnight. That's why people are willing to pay the premium." Perth-based Alinta has a dividend yield of about 3 percent, compared with smaller rival Envestra Ltd.'s ( ENV.AX ) 7.6 percent, according to Reuters data. Alinta confirmed it had received a revised bid from Macquarie, but gave no details of the offer. Analysts said there was still no guarantee Macquarie would win the battle. "There's still uncertainty over the value of the new listed vehicle. That was (Alinta's) main concern then and would remain so," Carpentier said. The tussle for Alinta, which came after it put itself up for sale following a management buyout proposal in January, has sent its shares surging 37 percent since the start of the year to Friday's close of A$15.25. Its was on a trading halt on Monday. Alinta is Australia's largest energy infrastructure firm with assets including gas transmission pipelines and a lucrative asset management division, which operates and maintains all the distribution and transmission assets. The company, which completed a A$6.3 billion asset swap with AGL Energy Ltd. ( AGK.AX ) in October, has seen its market capitalization jump 20-fold to about A$7.6 billion since listing in 2000. BABCOCK CONFIDENT Babcock, which has teamed up with state-owned utility Singapore Power, said in a statement that Alinta's board has advised the consortium of an alternative proposal that the board had a "fiduciary duty" to consider. "We are well advanced in preparation of documentation and are confident that upon satisfaction of its fiduciary obligations, the board will continue to recommend the consortium's proposal," Babcock & Brown Chief Executive Phil Green said in a statement. Babcock's initial A$7.4 billion offer valued Alinta at around A$15 a share. The Babcock offer included A$8.50 in cash, and shares in Babcock's infrastructure, power and wind funds, A$0.40 franking credits, as well as 1.51 Australia Pipeline Trust ( APA.AX ) units for every five Alinta shares. According to Reuters calculations, the value of the offer has since increased to A$15.98 based on Friday's closing prices, largely because of a rise in the value of the Babcock funds. To sweeten the deal, Babcock said last month shareholders with 1,000 Alinta shares or less could receive all cash. Singapore Power owns 51 percent of Australia's SP Ausnet ( SPN.AX ), an energy network operator. Macquarie and Babcock want Alinta's assets for their scarcity value following a recent flurry of consolidation in the sector. Alinta's raft of profitable assets have also lured AGL, Australia's largest energy distributor, into the mix. AGL said on Friday it had agreed to pay Macquarie A$345 million to acquire the 67 percent of AlintaAGL it does not already own, if Macquarie succeeds in a bid for Alinta. AlintaAGL, spun off in last years' asset swap deal, is a joint venture company that holds Alinta's Western Australia retail and generation businesses. ($1=1.22 Australian dollar)
