 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch's News Corp NWS.N said on Monday it has sold its 7.5 percent stake in Australian newspaper publisher John Fairfax Holdings Ltd. ( FXJ.AX ). 

 "Yes, we have sold all our shares in Fairfax," a Sydney-based News Corp spokesman said. A parcel of 75 million shares valued at A$381 million ($310 million) was sold to institutional investors by Goldman Sachs JBWere earlier Monday at A$5.07 per share, sources familiar with the transaction told Reuters. Fairfax shares fell 2.9 percent to A$5.12 at 0052 GMT. News Corp bought the stock at A$5.20 a share in October last year ahead of a change in Australia's media ownership laws but said at the time the stake was not a precursor to a takeover for Fairfax. A source familiar with the situation said News made a profit on the transaction in U.S. dollar terms following a sharp rise in the Australian dollar and the payment of a fully franked dividend since its purchase. The Fairfax stock was valued at US$3.95 when it bought and US$4.16 when it sold, the source said. Fairfax had been considered one of the most likely media takeover targets in Australia because of its open share register. It bid A$2.8 billion for regional media group Rural Press RUP.AX last year to strengthen against a possible bid. Seven Network Ltd SEV.AX also bought a stake in the publisher. News Corp. last week it had made a $5 billion bid to buy Dow Jones & Co. DJ.N, publisher of the Wall Street Journal.
