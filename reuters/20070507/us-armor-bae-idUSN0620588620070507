 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - British defense contractor BAE Systems BA.L was in final talks to buy Armor Holdings Inc. ( AH.N ) in a deal worth $3.5 billion, the Wall Street Journal reported on its Web site on Sunday. 

 Final preparations for the deal with Armor Holdings, which is a leading maker of armor for U.S. troops and Humvees, were being made and it was still possible the transaction could fall apart, the Journal said, citing unnamed sources. The deal would give Armor shareholders about $88 a share, about 7 percent premium to the company's stock price on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, the paper said. A BAE spokesman declined to comment. Armor could not immediately be reached for comment.
