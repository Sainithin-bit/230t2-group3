 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Some U.S. airlines rolled back much of their recent systemwide fare increases on Monday in a sign that carriers are losing pricing power amid softening demand. 

 Continental Airlines CAL.N sparked a broad fare increase last Friday by raising prices $5 each way on all continental U.S. flights. The move was matched by most major airlines, but not by budget carriers like Southwest Airlines Co. ( LUV.N ) American Airlines, a unit of AMR Corp. AMR.N, said it partially rolled back the fare hike. United Airlines, a unit of UAL Corp. UAUA.O, also rescinded part of its increase, and US Airways Group Inc. ( LCC.N ) pulled back the hike entirely, according to fare analyst Neil Bainton at Farecompare.com. Continental wasn't immediately available to comment. The unsuccessful attempt at a fare increase is the latest setback for the long-suffering industry, which has been contending with jet fuel prices that have risen by about one-third over the last four months. With demand showing signs of softening and competition intense, the U.S. carriers appear to have little power to pass the higher costs on to consumers. "We continue to doubt the effectiveness of subsequent domestic fare increases," said JP Morgan analyst Jamie Baker in a research note. He said despite 20 fare increases since January 2006, domestic flights cost only about 1 percent to 2 percent more than a year ago. Last year, fare increases along with reduced capacity and lower costs helped the industry claw its way out of a five-year downturn. AMR shares rose 1.3 percent to $27.82 on the New York Stock Exchange, while UAL shares rose 1.8 percent to $36.20 on Nasdaq. US Airways shares were up 13 cents at $36.27 on the NYSE. Continental was up 34 cents at $39.21 on the NYSE. (Additional reporting by  Chris Reiter )
