 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Carl Icahn said on Monday he does not expect to win a seat on the board of Motorola Inc. MOT.N because three or four large mutual fund shareholders likely voted against him. 

 Icahn made the comments in a speech to more than 500 Motorola shareholders as they cast votes at the No. 2 mobile phone maker's annual meeting in Chicago. "I think it's going to be relatively close," Icahn told shareholders at the meeting at the Art Institute of Chicago, adding that he thought he had secured support from small funds and small shareholders. "I probably won't win." Motorola said the preliminary results of the vote will not be available for about three weeks. Icahn, 71, has taken roughly a 3 percent stake in Motorola since he revealed plans in late January to seek a board seat. The news was welcomed by investors who wanted to jolt Motorola into making changes, though some shareholders also feared that Icahn could be a distraction for executives. Motorola's management, led by Chief Executive Ed Zander, has come under increasing criticism in recent quarters as the company struggled with weak cell phone sales that caused it to post a first-quarter loss. Icahn had initially said he wanted Motorola to conduct a large share buyback. But after the company said last quarter that its 2007 outlook was bleaker-than-expected, he changed his position, saying fixing Motorola's operational problems took precedence over repurchasing shares. Motorola had urged shareholders not to vote for Icahn, saying the activist investor was already on too many boards and lacked experience in the wireless industry. "The argument against me I took some umbrage to," Icahn said. But he added that no matter the outcome, he had won because "this company has gotten the message." CORDIAL TONE In a shareholders meeting that was surprisingly cordial following a bitter months-long proxy battle, Icahn even went as far as to congratulate Zander if he won. That was in sharp contrast to Icahn's earlier criticisms, such as when he said Motorola had "suffered a critical failure in oversight and leadership" and likened reported comments by Zander to "something straight out of Alice in Wonderland." Icahn started his speech on Monday by saying, "I feel like Marc Antony coming to the funeral of Caesar here." He paraphrased Shakespeare, "Ed Zander is a qualified man, so are they all qualified men." When asked by a shareholder who he would put in Zander's place, Icahn responded, "I don't have a person in mind to put in." He added, "This isn't personal about Ed. I like Ed." For his part, Zander made a point of starting the meeting by recognizing Icahn and allowing him to answer shareholders' questions. After touting progress by the company in 2006, Zander said Motorola needs to do better. He said Motorola will unveil next Tuesday new mobile devices based on 3G mobile and Java technologies. The company had blamed a lack of 3G devices for its recent weak sales. "We need to do a better job in mobile devices," Zander said. "We know what we have to do as a management team."
