 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - A group bidding for Qantas Airways Ltd. ( QAN.AX ) said on Monday it was considering the possibility of making a renewed offer at A$5.45 per share after its previous proposal expired on Friday. 

 The bid group, which includes Macquarie Bank Ltd. MBL.AX and private equity firm Texas Pacific Group TPG.UL, said it was considering alternative proposals as a majority of Qantas shareholders by number and value had lodged acceptances for the offer. ($1=A$1.23)
