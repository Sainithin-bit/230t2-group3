 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Liquidnet, a rapidly growing electronic stock-trading marketplace, is considering an initial public offering as early as next year, its chief executive, Seth Merrin, said on Monday. 

 "We are exploring the idea of potentially listing in 2008. No guarantees. For sure not in 2007, but a potential for 2008," Merrin told the Reuters Exchanges and Trading Summit in New York. Liquidnet, founded by Merrin in 1999, manages electronic networks that let institutional investors anonymously trade large blocks of stock without traditional brokers and exchanges. The company has become a Top 10 broker in the United States and Europe, taking advantage of the accelerating shift from human trading to faster, less costly electronic systems. Liquidnet said that by the end of 2006 it handled, on average, the trading of 53.6 million shares a day. It is a Top 10 broker on the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq and the London Stock Exchange. By comparison, Investment Technology Group Inc. ( ITG.N ) is the biggest stock-crossing network with average first-quarter trading of 61.1 million shares a day on its POSIT system. Over the next 12 months to 18 months, he said, Liquidnet will focus on adding new products and expanding into new regions to broaden its sources of revenue. Liquidnet recently acquired Miletus Trading, a broker-dealer offering program trading for investment managers and hedge funds. The company also is expanding into the Asia-Pacific region, where developing stock markets and rapidly growing economies are creating new opportunities, Merrin said. Calling in by telephone from China's Macao, Merrin said Liquidnet is opening offices in Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore and Australia. The firm is working with regulators in those countries to launch its trading system, he said. "We have a tremendous amount of opportunity on our plate and have a lot of execution to do," Merrin told the summit. "We have to deliver over the next year and a half, further diversify our revenue stream." Liquidnet contemplates converting to a publicly traded company at a time when the exchanges industry undergoes sweeping change. In recent years a number of nonprofit, membership-owned markets have gone public, and exchanges are consolidating rapidly through mergers. Fast growth in trading activity, and merger activity among markets, have sent the stock value of exchanges soaring in the past few years. Yet Merrin tells Reuters that going public is not an easy decision. "I'm not especially enthusiastic about taking it public. My aspiration was not to run a public company," Merrin said. Merrin blamed Sarbanes Oxley corporate governance reforms in the United States as being a deterrent for foreign companies going public. Indeed, Merrin said he has not decided where Liquidnet shares will list. Still, Liquidnet wants to take care of its investors and employees. Merrin said major investors include private equity firm Thomas H. Lee Partners THL.UL, employees and himself. "We made a commitment from the start that we wanted everyone to be partners in this venture and to benefit from it. Unless I can figure out another way to have everyone benefit from, the IPO would be the avenue I would take," Merrin said.
