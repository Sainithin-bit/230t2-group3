 OMAHA, Nebraska  (Reuters) - Warren Buffett said on Sunday that the $5 billion takeover bid by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. NWSa.N for Dow Jones & Co. DJ.N may not be the final offer for the owner of the Wall Street Journal. 

 Dow Jones has taken no action on Murdoch's $60 per share offer, and a majority of its controlling Bancroft family opposes the bid. In a press conference, Buffett said Dow Jones carries an extra cachet because of the Journal's reputation and broad international reach, and that this could prompt some prospective bidders to offer more for the company. Buffett said newspaper companies have "A" and "B" values, with the former measuring the cash they can generate, and the latter involving factors including "power (and) ego" that can accompany purchases of specific companies. He said Dow Jones has a high "B" value, as would New York Times Co. ( NYT.N ). "I think Rupert would even acknowledge that some part of his interest in the Wall Street Journal goes beyond economics," said Buffett, who runs Berkshire Hathaway Inc. ( BRKa.N ) ( BRKb.N ). "The truth is there are a lot of people in the world who would pay a lot more." "The question is, who will add the most for the B value," Buffett continued. "The B value for Dow Jones is huge. It's going to be a factor with Rupert. It's going to be a factor for any other bidder who emerges .... The last chapter has not necessarily been written on that." Dow Jones also publishes Barron's and the Marketwatch.com financial news Web site, and runs Dow Jones Newswires, which competes with Reuters Group Plc in publishing financial news. Shares of Dow Jones closed Friday at $55.80 on the New York Stock Exchange.
