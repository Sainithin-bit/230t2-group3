 TORONTO  (Reuters) - Electronic publisher Thomson Corp. TOC.TO TOC.N confirmed on Monday that it has approached Reuters Group Plc RTR.L RTRSY.O about a potential takeover that could create a global financial services and media powerhouse. 

 Thomson said in a brief statement that it had made a "preliminary" approach to Reuters' board of directors that "may or may not lead to an offer being made for Reuters." The company added that a further announcement would come "in due course" and did not give any indication of the value of any potential offer. A spokesman had no further comment. A Reuters spokesman also had no comment. Reuters shares soared as much as 32 percent in London on Friday to 649-3/4 pence after reports that Thomson was in talks regarding a takeover bid. U.K.-based Reuters also confirmed last week it received an approach, but did not name the potential suitor. An offer of 650 pence per share would give Reuters an equity value of about 8.2 billion pounds, or $16.3 billion. On Monday, Reuters' U.S. ADRs rose $1.74 to $76.50. In London, the shares last traded at 615-3/4 pence on Friday, as British markets were closed on Monday. Thomson provides software, information and other applications for professionals in law, finance, health care and science. It had 2006 revenues of $6.6 billion. Reuters, which is well known for its financial data and real-time news, was founded in 1851. Today, it makes more than 90 percent of its revenue from its financial services business. A combination of the companies would create a financial data and news empire that analysts have said would give Thomson a lead over privately owned Bloomberg in terms of both revenue and the number of screens on which the services are provided. Bloomberg is a major competitor of Reuters. Thomson is selling its education division, which analysts estimate could fetch more than $5 billion. The proceeds could be used to help finance a purchase of Reuters. Gavin Graham, chief investment officer at Guardian Group of Funds in Toronto, which owns Thomson shares, said the levels to which Reuters shares spiked on Friday could foreshadow the price at which bidding could begin. "The present level of price probably is a fair indication of where the initial bid might be," he said. Thomson Chief Executive Richard Harrington has said the proceeds from the Thomson Learning sale would be spent on acquisitions and "tactical investments." Thomson is controlled by its founding billionaire Thomson family of Canada, which owns 70 percent of its shares. The company is based in Toronto, but its operations are headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut. Paul Bradley, director of research at Fraser Mackenzie in Toronto, said Thomson moves carefully and deliberately, "so the very fact that it's even having some kind of discussion says that they think this can stack up and make sense." Bradley also said it's too early to speculate about valuations for Reuters, given the scant amount of information provided by the company. He added the business of providing electronic data to the financial services industry is people-intensive and spreading those costs and capital investments over a larger customer base could help Thomson make its business stronger. Under Reuters' ownership structure, a single "golden" share can block a hostile bid. That share is held by The Reuters Founder Share Co., which is run by 15 trustees charged with ensuring Reuters' "independence, impartiality, integrity and freedom from bias." A friendly bid would be possible, however. Thomson made its announcement after North American markets closed. During the day, its shares fell 86 Canadian cents to C$47.23 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. In New York, they fell 62 cents to $42.83. ($1=$1.10 Canadian) ($1.99=1 pound sterling)
