 MONTREAL  (Reuters) - Alcoa Inc. ( AA.N ), the world's top maker of primary aluminum, said on Monday it expects to obtain anti-trust agency approval for its proposed $27 billion takeover of global No. 2, Alcan Inc. AL.TO. 

 "We are confident that the transaction will be approved," Alcoa Chief Executive Alain Belda told analysts on a conference call on Monday morning. Belda said he expected that the merged companies would likely have to divest assets in the aerospace sector. Belda said Alcoa had already had discussions with various anti-trust regulators, and with government officials in Ottawa, Quebec City and Montreal.
