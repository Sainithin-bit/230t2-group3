 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Clear Channel Communications Inc. ( CCU.N ) said on Monday it was delaying a shareholder vote on a buyout proposed by two private equity firms, as it considers a higher, revised $19.6 billion offer by the bidders. 

 The company said it was in talks with the bidders, Bain Capital Partners and Thomas H. Lee Partners THL.UL, about a possible change in the structure of the deal to value Clear Channel at $39.20 a share, rather than $39 a share, and give shareholders the option to take an ongoing stake in the company following the deal's closing. The radio station operator also said it was delaying Tuesday's vote on the $39 offer to May 22 -- the third time the vote has been delayed. The bidders last week put forward a proposal to increase the bid to $39.20 a share for unaffiliated shareholders, while the founding Mays family and Clear Channel board would receive the $37.60-a-share bid originally recommended. Clear Channel originally rejected that bid, arguing that its acceptance would delay the date of the meeting by up to 90 days, with no certainty the transaction would be approved by shareholders. But shareholders have since been pressuring Clear Channel to reconsider its decision, with several stockholders telling Reuters they had called the company's board to persuade them to delay the vote. The latest deal structure being discussed would see $39.20 paid to all shareholders -- not just unaffiliated parties -- and offer shareholders a choice of taking cash or stock, up to 30 percent of Clear Channel, following the buyout. "The deal's prospects are slightly better than a week ago when to all intents and purposes it did not look good," said John Blackledge, analyst at JP Morgan. "There may have been some shareholders that were on the fence who maybe would consider this now." Blackledge wrote in a research note that it was a signal that the private equity buyers want this asset "enough that they are willing to shape the deal in some fashion that would ultimately appease enough shareholders to approve the deal". VOTE DELAYED The delayed May 22 vote is still for shareholders to decide on the $39 bid, a source familiar with the situation said. The vote could be delayed for a fourth time if shareholders request that the $39.20 deal be voted on instead. The vote would then be rescheduled for up to 90 days, because a new proxy statement would have to be drawn up and circulated to shareholders and to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, that source said. At some point in the next two weeks, Clear Channel is expected to make clear whether the May 22 vote will go forward or be rescheduled again. Consideration of a revised deal is the latest twist in the battle for Clear Channel since it announced in October that it had hired Goldman Sachs & Co. ( GS.N ) to help it evaluate strategic alternatives. That provoked interest from a number of private equity players. In November, Bain and T.H. Lee beat out a rival consortium including Providence Equity Partners, Blackstone Group BG.UL and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts KKR.UL, to buy Clear Channel for $37.60 a share. Bain and T.H. Lee's bid ran into trouble when a small number of large shareholders, and influential proxy advisory service ISS, said the bid undervalued the deal. Earlier this year, they raised the bid to $39 a share, then put forward a proposal last week for $39.20. SHAREHOLDER SUPPORT? While the revised proposal appeared to gain more shareholder support, it was unclear whether it would gather enough to succeed. The deal faces a difficult hurdle because under Texas law, holders of at least two-thirds of a company's shares must approve the transaction. Shareholders who fail to vote are counted as voting against the deal. The revised structure had been supported by Highfields Capital Management LP, a significant shareholder that originally opposed the bid, sources told Reuters last week. However it was still unclear whether Fidelity Investments, a major shareholder that has steadfastly opposed the sale, would support the new bid. A source close to the mutual fund firm and familiar with the situation said on Friday it would still oppose a bid at $39.20. Fidelity declined comment on Monday. Opposition from Fidelity and Highfields as well as from proxy advisory service ISS to the original deal had dealt a large blow to the prospect of getting it through a vote. Clear Channel's shares closed 95 cents higher, or 2.6 percent, to $37.30 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Additional reporting by Muralikumar Anantharaman in Boston)
