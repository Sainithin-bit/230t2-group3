 OMAHA, Nebraska  (Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Sunday said his Berkshire Hathaway Inc. ( BRKa.N ) ( BRKb.N ) insurance and investment company has cut in half from 2006 its exposure to hurricane-related losses, citing a less favorable pricing environment. 

 "We wouldn't mind it being as much as last year, we wouldn't mind it being more than last year, if the prices were appropriate," Buffett said at a press conference. "This year, we will be less of a player by quite a margin." Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire typically generates more than half of earnings from insurance-related operations. The company suffered some $3 billion of losses in 2005 from Gulf Coast hurricanes, including Katrina. It benefited in 2006 from a lack of major storms, and as rivals pulled back from offering some policies. This allowed Berkshire to command higher prices because of a lack of competition.
