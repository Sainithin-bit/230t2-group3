 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - British defense contractor BAE Systems Plc BA.L moved to expand its share of the lucrative U.S. military market on Monday with a $4.1 billion deal to buy body armor and Army truck maker Armor Holdings Inc. ( AH.N ). 

 The deal is the second multibillion-dollar U.S. purchase in two years for BAE, which is now the No. 8 supplier in the world's biggest military market. Two years ago, BAE bought United Defense Industries, maker of Bradley fighting vehicles, for $4.2 billion. Europe's largest defense contractor -- which makes Typhoon jet fighters, Nimrod reconnaissance planes and nuclear-powered submarines -- is building up its military business after selling its stake in planemaker Airbus ( EAD.PA ) last year. BAE already gets about 40 percent of its almost 14 billion pounds ($27.8 billion) annual sales in the United States. It ranks as No. 8 among Pentagon contractors, taking the lead role on $4.7 billion of awards last year. It gets billions more from subcontracting on big jobs for other firms like Lockheed Martin Corp. ( LMT.N ) and Northrop Grumman Corp. ( NOC.N ). "BAE is already big in the North American armor market and it needed to put the cash from its Airbus sale to work," said Loren Thompson of defense research group the Lexington Institute. "This is the latest sign that BAE is deeply committed to concentrating in the defense business, with the U.S. government as its premier customer." SHARES UP SHARPLY The purchase price for Armor Holdings -- which makes military vehicles, Humvee armaments and body armor for soldiers -- was $88 per share, a 7 percent premium to its closing stock price on Friday. That values Armor Holdings at about 18.6 times Wall Street's forecast for this year's earnings, compared to an average of 16.7 times for other U.S. defense firms. Armor Holdings shares rose $4.41, or 5.3 percent, to $86.55 on the New York Stock Exchange. Earlier in the session they hit an all-time high of $87.75. BAE shares did not trade as London's stock exchange was closed for a holiday. Armor Holdings' stock has shot up since the start of the Iraq war, now worth nine times what it was in early March, 2003. Snipers and roadside bombs in Iraq and Afghanistan pushed the Pentagon to order more of Armor Holdings' protective gear, and armor sales are set to rise despite mounting pressure for U.S. forces to withdraw from Iraq. The Pentagon is planning to spend up to $8.4 billion over the next few years on 7,000 Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicles. U.S. prime contractor General Dynamics Corp. ( GD.N ) -- the leading maker of tanks and armored vehicles for the U.S. Army -- is BAE's major competitor on the contract. BAE said the Armor Holdings purchase would add $3 billion to its U.S. revenues and would add to earnings immediately. It said it would finance the deal partly by selling new shares, with a placement set to launch on Tuesday in London. About two-thirds of the purchase price would be funded from cash. BAE will also assume $388 million of Armor Holdings debt. The U.S. company, which itself bought Army truck maker Stewart & Stevenson in May 2006, has about 8,000 employees. BAE, which was formed in 1999 after British Aerospace merged with GEC's Marconi Electronic Systems, has 88,000 employees. POLITICAL OBSTACLES Political sensitivity to defense mergers should not hold up the deal, the head of BAE's U.S. unit said on Monday. "We have never had an acquisition denied by the U.S. government and we do not believe this acquisition will have any issues going through the regulatory process," said Walt Havenstein, who took over as BAE's U.S. chief early this year. He said he was not aware of any government issues that might scuttle the deal, despite recent reports that the United States' Justice Department was concerned about BAE's dealings with Saudi Arabia. British investigators abruptly halted a two-year corruption inquiry into BAE's $12 billion sale of fighter jets to Saudi Arabia last December, after the UK government warned the probe might threaten national security. BAE has denied wrongdoing. Armor Holdings may yet face charges from the U.S. Justice Department over its use of zylon in its body armor vests, which turned out to be less effective than expected in stopping bullets, which forced the company to replace vests. BAE's Havenstein said he would consider selling units of Armor Holdings after it has completed the purchase of the whole company, saying that some parts of the company are more "aligned" with BAE than others. That could herald a later sale of Armor Holdings' business selling bullet-proof vests, clubs and other equipment to police forces.
