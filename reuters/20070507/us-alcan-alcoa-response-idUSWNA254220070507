 MONTREAL  (Reuters) - Alcan Inc. AL.TO, the world's second-largest maker of primary aluminum, said on Monday it would consider an unsolicited $27 billion takeover bid its No. 1 rival Alcoa Inc. ( AA.N ) 

 Alcan said it recommended that its shareholders defer making any decision on the Alcoa offer until the Canadian company's board has had an opportunity to review the bid and make a formal recommendation on its merits. Alcan said it remained committed to building and delivering value for its shareholders and other stakeholders. Alcan shares surged $21.15, or 31 percent, to C$88.70 on the Toronto Stock Exchange and $19.78 to $80.81 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday morning. ($1=$1.10 Canadian)
