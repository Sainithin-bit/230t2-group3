 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - ABN AMRO AAH.AS said on Monday that it received a $24.5 billion proposal for its U.S. subsidiary LaSalle Bank from a consortium of banks led by Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ). 

 The offer is higher than the $21 billion that Bank of America ( BAC.N ) agreed to pay for LaSalle, but a Dutch court ruled last week that ABN must put the sale of the U.S. bank to shareholders for a vote, throwing into doubt whether Bank of America could complete the deal. Bank of America sued ABN AMRO on Friday, seeking damages and a court injunction to block the sale of ABN's U.S. unit LaSalle to a rival bidder. Because the consortium's offer for LaSalle was conditional on the RBS and its partners Santander ( SAN.MC ) and Fortis FOR.BR acquiring all of ABN in a separate offer rivaling the $88 billion Barclays buyout of ABN, the Dutch bank said that it would hold an extraordinary shareholder's meeting to let shareholders decide. "It is ABN AMRO's intention to hold an Extraordinary General Meeting, the details of which will be made available in due course, to enable shareholders to express their views on the alternatives available to them at that time," ABN said in a statement.
