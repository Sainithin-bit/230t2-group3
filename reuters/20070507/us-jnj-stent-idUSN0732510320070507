 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ.N ) said on Monday an experimental drug-coated stent failed to meet its primary goal in a study, pushing J&J shares down 1.3 percent before the bell. 

 J&J unit Conor Medical Systems also said it will discontinue sales of the so-called CoStar stent in certain countries in Europe, Asia and Latin America -- where it is already approved. A pivotal study compared J&J's investigational device with one already sold by Boston Scientific Corp. ( BSX.N ). Drug-coated stents are tiny wire mesh tubes used to prop open recently unclogged heart arteries and have until recently been reliable cash cows for device makers. J&J, which said it is stopping all ongoing trials of the device, said it saw no signs of safety troubles with the CoStar stent, but it failed to prove "non-inferiority" against Boston Scientific's Taxus stent. The company blamed the study's failure to meet its clinical goal on a problem with the dosing of paclitaxel, the drug that coats the stent. It said it will try to develop a new version of the device with a different drug, sirolimus, which is used on J&J's already marketed drug-coated stent called Cypher. Overall rates of death, heart attack and other serious heart events were consistent with other drug-coated stents, J&J said. The CoStar stent is one of several in a next generation of the drug-coated devices that companies and analysts hope will restart growth, which has been slumping amid safety worries. Doctors have been switching back to cheaper bare-metal stents amid concerns of a small but serious risk of blood clots linked to the drug-coated varieties, depressing profits for device makers. The company was set to hold a conference call on the issue Monday morning.
