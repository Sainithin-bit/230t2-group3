 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - American Home Mortgage Investment Corp. AHM.N said on Thursday it had ceased most operations and would cut nearly 7,000 jobs. 

 The mortgage lender's rapid descent is surprising because it makes loans to people who are considered good credit risks. Most of the turmoil in the mortgage industry has been with subprime borrowers, or people with weak credit. American Home Mortgage said it has ceased taking mortgage applications and has notified loan production employees that they will be terminated, effective Friday. The company's employee base will be reduced to about 750 from more than 7,000, the company said.
