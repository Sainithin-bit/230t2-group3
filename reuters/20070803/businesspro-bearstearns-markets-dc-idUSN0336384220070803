 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bond market turmoil sending investors 
fleeing from risk may be a worse predicament than the 1980s 
stock market fall and Internet bubble burst, Bear Stearns Chief 
Financial Officer Sam Molinaro said on Friday. 

  "These times are pretty significant in the fixed income 
market," Molinaro said on a conference call with analysts. 
"It's as been as bad as I've seen it in 22 years. The fixed 
income market environment we've seen in the last eight weeks 
has been pretty extreme."  "So, yes, we would make that comparison" to market events 
that also include the debt crisis of the late 1990s, he said.
