 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp. ( 7203.T ), the world's largest and most profitable automaker, said on Friday that there had been no change to the upward trend for its U.S. sales, despite a fall in July. 

 Senior Managing Director Takeshi Suzuki told a news conference that although sales had dipped last month, it was the second highest level of July sales the company has seen. The highest was July 2006, when industry volumes grew on back of big incentives being offered led by Detroit brands. He also said U.S. sales incentives on the Tundra pick-up truck were on track to decline.
