 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The service sector grew much more slowly in July as the economy continues to show signs of weakness, according to a report released on Friday. 

 The Institute for Supply Management's services index fell to 55.8 last month from 60.7 in June, well below forecasts for a drop to 59.0. A number above 50 indicates growth. The services sector represents about 80 percent of U.S. economic activity, including businesses like restaurants, hotels, banks and airlines.
