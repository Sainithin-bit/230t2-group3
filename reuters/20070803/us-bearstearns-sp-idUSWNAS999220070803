 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bear Stearns Cos. BSC.N said on Friday Standard & Poors' decision to change its outlook on Bear Stearns debt to "negative" was unwarranted. 

 "Most of the themes highlighted in its report are common to the industry and are not likely to have a disproportional impact on Bear Stearns," Bear said in a statement. "S&P's specific concerns over issues relating to certain hedge funds managed by (Bear Stearns Asset Management) are unwarranted as these were isolated incidents and are by no means an indication of broader issues at Bear Stearns," the company said. S&P earlier on Friday changed its outlook on Bear's debt to "negative" from "stable," which means it is more likely to cut Bear's ratings over the next year or two. "S&P's action highlights the concerns in the marketplace over the recent instability in the fixed-income environment," Bear Stearns Chairman and Chief Executive James Cayne said in the statement. "Contrary to rumors in the marketplace, our franchise is profitable and healthy and our balance sheet is strong and liquid."
