 LONDON  (Reuters) - British Airways BAY.L Chief Executive Willie Walsh said on Friday the airline's provision of 350 million pounds ($710.9 million) is expected to cover all fines related to fuel-surcharge price fixing. 

 "That was a best estimate and that remains the case," he told reporters on a conference call. BA set aside the provision in May and this week U.S. and UK authorities unveiled fines worth almost 270 million pounds. Authorities in Europe, Canada, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand are also probing BA's fuel surcharges.
