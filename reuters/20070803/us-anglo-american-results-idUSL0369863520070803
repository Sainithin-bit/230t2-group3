 LONDON  (Reuters) - Miner Anglo American ( AAL.L ) unveiled plans to sell Tarmac, its UK-based road building unit, as it met forecasts with a 22 percent rise in first-half earnings and announced a further $4 billion share buyback. 

 The sale, which analysts believe could raise around $6 billion, is the latest move by Anglo aimed at focusing on its core mining business following bouts of underperformance against its peers and speculation it might attract a break-up bid. The copper, platinum and gold specialist said on Friday it made underlying earnings of $3.1 billion in the six months to June 30, broadly in line with analysts' average forecast of $3.2 billion, according to Reuters Estimates, and said the outlook for most of its metals and minerals remained positive.
