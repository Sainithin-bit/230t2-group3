 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) is hoping to have a tentative deal to sell its Land Rover and Jaguar operations by September 30, and a pact to dispose of Volvo by year end, The New York Times reported on its Web site on Friday. 

 The auto maker's advisers have begun putting together information that bidders want for Land Rover and Jaguar, the paper said, citing unnamed sources. A Ford spokesman called the report "speculation" and would not comment further.
