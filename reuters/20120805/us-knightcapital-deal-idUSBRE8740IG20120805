 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Embattled equities trading firm Knight Capital Group ( KCG.N ) was close to securing a $400 million capital injection from a group of about a half dozen investors, CNBC reported Sunday, citing a person involved with the deal. 
 Chicago market-maker Getco and Omaha brokerage firm TD Ameritrade ( AMTD.N ) appear likely to be part of the investment group, the source told CNBC. A Knight spokesperson could not be reached by CNBC and the report did not cite any response or comment from Getco or TD Ameritrade. The reported $400 million capital infusion would come in the form of sale of convertible securities or bonds that turn into stock in Knight at a certain fixed price, CNBC reported. Knight has been in crisis since Wednesday, when the firm lost $440 million -- most of its capital -- after a software glitch caused it to make thousands of unintended trades. The company said on Thursday it was actively pursuing strategic and financing alternatives. (Reporting By  Katya Wachtel ; Editing by Maureen Bavdek)
