 ESSEN, Germany  (Reuters) - A column of several hundred anti-globalization protesters marched through central Essen on Saturday as finance ministers and central bankers from the G7 rich nations met to discuss the global economy. 


 About 700 marched peacefully through the center of the industrial German city, waving banners carrying slogans such as "another world is possible", "make capitalism history and create a new world", "stop the WTO" and "stop locusts, ban hedge funds". Hedge funds, trade and other topics are being discussed over two days of talks among the world's richest countries in the Group of Seven and six rapidly expanding emerging economies. The column of protesters -- marching about a kilometer from the hotel where the VIPs are staying -- had a broad mix of people. It was headed by about 50 youths in black hooded tops, while further along there were some senior citizens. There was a heavy police presence, with officers walking in front of, alongside and behind the crowd. Riot police guarded the approach to the VIPs' hotel. On Friday, a small group of debt campaigners gathered near the meeting place to keep up the pressure on rich countries to deliver on commitments to boost aid to Africa and allot 0.7 percent of gross domestic product to development aid. The G7 groups the United States, Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada. Brazil, China, India, Mexico, Russia and South Africa were invited to Friday's talks. China and Russia were also involved on Saturday.
