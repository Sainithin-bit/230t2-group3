 LONDON (Reuters) -- Nasdaq Stock Markets Inc. ( NDAQ.O ) suffered a resounding defeat in its 2.7 billion pound ( ($5.31 billion) bid for the London Stock Exchange ( LSE.L ) on Saturday, saying it had won just 0.41 pct of acceptances for its offer for Europe's largest share market. 


 Added to the 28.75 percent shareholding it already owns it fell well short of the level of just over 50 percent of shareholder acceptances it needed to take control of the LSE. The London Stock Exchange, which has seen off four takeover attempts in the last two years, said it was now free to fulfil its vision to be the world's capital market without the distraction of defending itself from "ill-considered approaches which fail to understand the value of the business." "The exchange intends to build on its exceptionally valuable brand by progressing various competitive, collaborative and strategic opportunities, thereby reinforcing its uniquely powerful position in a fast evolving global sector, the LSE's Chairman Chris Gibson-Smith said in a statement. LSE shares closed at 1,282 pence on Friday, a 3 percent premium to Nasdaq's 1,243 pence a share offer. Two analysts said the shares were likely to hold relatively firm when dealing opens on Monday since the investors and hedge funds who control interests in the exchange through derivatives, such as contracts for difference (CFDs) and options, have demonstrated by their dismissal of Nasdaq's offer that they believe the LSE's future prospects underpin the share price level. Both exchanges had engaged in a war of words in recent weeks, with Nasdaq stressing that its offer price also reflected the impact of increased competition from dissatisfied investment banks, which agreed late last year to create a rival trading platform. That plan, called Project Turquoise, is being developed by a group including Citigroup Inc. (C.N), Credit Suisse Group (CSGN.VX) and Merrill Lynch & Co. (MER.N). The LSE has said the boom in electronic trading, together with its ability to attract companies from around the globe to list on its exchange in an environment of benign regulation means it is worth considerably more than 1,243 pence. "I increasingly believe that Project Turquoise will happen. A year ago I wouldn't have believed that 50 percent of the LSE's liquidity would club together to take that business away from the exchange," Mamoun Tazi, an analyst at Man Financial said on Friday. The pace of mergers among the world's stock exchanges is picking up as they come under pressure from customers to offer global services and cut fees. Competition is also becoming more intense, with a group of investment banks planning to create a pan-European equity trading platform this year. The LSE has long been a takeover target, in part because of its relatively small market capitalization compared with rivals. Its shares have more than trebled over the past two years as it has received and rejected a string of offers. Nasdaq said it stood by its view that 1,243 pence was a fair price, given increased competition in the industry. "We are naturally disappointed at this outcome as we remain of the view that the final offer represented a full and fair price for LSE shareholders," Nasdaq CEO Robert Greifeld said in a statement. "However, this disappointment is tempered by the knowledge that we remained true to our value case." Speculation now falls on what Nasdaq intends to do with its 30 percent stake, which on average -- taking into account the foreign exchange hedge on its investment and the LSE's share buyback -- cost it around 1,100p per share. Some analysts say it is likely to hang onto its stake, while others think it may sell to a strategic investor or a private equity firm. "It could be that they want to sell it. Unlike the last time they should not tell the market what they plan to do before doing it," said one analyst who declined to be named. A combination of the Nasdaq and LSE would have created the world's second transatlantic exchange with a market value of the shares quoted on it of $11.8 trillion. Under UK takeover rules Nasdaq cannot bid for another 12 months. New York Stock Exchange owner NYSE Group (NYX.N) is currently taking over European exchange Euronext (ENXT.PA).
