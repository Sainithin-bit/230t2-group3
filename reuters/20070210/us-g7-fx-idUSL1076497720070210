 ESSEN, Germany  (Reuters) - The Group of Seven countries agreed on the following communique wording on exchange rates at their meeting in Essen on Saturday, a G7 source told Reuters ahead of the official release of the statement. 


 "We reaffirm that exchange rates should reflect economic fundamentals. Excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates are undesirable for economic growth. We continue to monitor exchange markets closely, and cooperate as appropriate. "In emerging economies with large and growing current account surpluses, especially China, it is desirable that their effective exchange rates move so that necessary adjustments will occur." The wording is almost identical to that of the exchange rate paragraph from the Singapore G7 meeting last September.
