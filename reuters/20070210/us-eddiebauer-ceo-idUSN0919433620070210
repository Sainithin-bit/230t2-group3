 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Eddie Bauer Holdings Inc. EBHI.O, the outdoor and casual clothing retailer, on Friday announced the resignation of Chief Executive Fabian Mansson, one day after shareholders rejected a $286 million takeover by two private equity firms. 


 Howard Gross, a member of the board and a former chief executive of Limited Stores and Victoria's Secret Stores, was named interim chief executive. Shareholders on Thursday rejected the proposed $9.25 per share buyout by affiliates of Sun Capital Partners and Golden Gate Capital. Eddie Bauer said 44 percent of shares outstanding voted for the merger, short of the necessary majority, and 37 percent voted against it, according to a Thursday regulatory filing. The company said its board is evaluating "appropriate next steps" for the company's turnaround. Mansson had overseen Eddie Bauer's 2005 emergence from the Chapter 11 reorganization process. Its former parent, catalog specialist Spiegel Inc., had sought protection from creditors in March 2003. Eddie Bauer was established in 1920 in Seattle. It is now based in suburban Redmond, and sells products through about 390 stores in the United States and Canada. Eddie Bauer shares closed Friday up 38 cents at $9.17 on the Nasdaq.
