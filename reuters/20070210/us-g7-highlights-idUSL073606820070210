 ESSEN, Germany  (Reuters) - The following are comments by finance ministers, central bank chiefs and other key officials in relation to the Group of Seven meeting in Essen, Germany. 


 JAPANESE FINANCE MINISTER KOJI OMI On possibility of G7 mentioning yen in communiqu: "I don't think the yen will be specifically mentioned in the statement." "I want to say that exchange rates should reflect economic fundamentals." From Friday: FRENCH FINANCE MINISTER THIERRY BRETON On likely FX content of communiqu: "We never name a specific currency. Don't expect a specific paragraph on a specific currency." GERMAN FINANCE MINISTER PEER STEINBRUECK On Doha round of international trade talks: "I am a bit more optimistic after talks I have had recently, for example with our foreign minister, for example after Davos, for example given the position of the United States. "But that is still a long way away from meaning that we are close to a result. "I hope that at the end of February, start of March, there should be a signal or some support from finance ministers, although they are not primarily responsible for this. "This is desirable, so that this window of opportunity does not close again." On hedge funds: "There is no doubt about the advantages and positive function of hedge funds. It's not about calling this positive function into doubt. We want to look more deeply at systemic risk. I am pleased that it's on the agenda. In the United States, investor protection is more the issue whereas in Europe we have the financial sector more in mind. We want to talk to hedge fund managers. "It would be good if the Financial Stability Forum got a mandate to update the report (from 2000) with a view to assessing the risks (hedge funds pose). "It's a victory that we are even talking about it at the table. This has not happened before in meetings of finance ministers and central bank governors. We could not talk about the issue if the British colleagues did not agree. It does not make any sense to treat the issue in a warlike manner as you would chase the other interlocutors from the table. "I want to organize a process where the most important players take part -- it does not make any sense to use strongarm tactics. We will start the process and work to take it forward." On possibility of including Russia as full G7 member: "It does not make sense to have the Russian Federation not as a full member at the table." "There are a lot of topics that cannot be discussed without the important emerging market countries like China, India, South Africa, Australia to name a few. I think that one should have them at the table. "It's not a formalized process, but in my opinion, this G7-G8 meeting will be expanded to include this circle, and in the sense of full membership." Asked whether there was evidence that the weak yen was hurting Europe: "No, I don't think so. We had a very, very advantageous trade balance during all the last year. This didn't affect any other neighbor in Europe negatively." On economy, interest rates, forex: "The global economy is in a good state and has been for several years. Germany is also making its contribution toward this. We haven't had a financial crisis for five years. There is plenty of liquidity. We have low long-term interest rates in Europe and the euro zone. We're finally getting capital flows to emerging and developing countries. But we will still have to deal with global imbalances. "We will obviously talk about exchange rates. But I am not going to make any comment now or later which will create unrest." BUNDESBANK PRESIDENT AXEL WEBER On hedge funds: "We must take the dialogue with industry forward. We must place great value on the effectiveness of market supervision mechanisms. It's certainly a difficult discussion." On world economy: "The world economy has been in a very robust growth environment for the past five years with global growth of around 5 percent. World trade is still expanding dynamically. Germany and Europe are making a clear contribution with stronger domestic demand. "We will make considerable progress on global imbalances. But risks remain. The main factor is the oil price -- there has been considerable volatility there recently."
