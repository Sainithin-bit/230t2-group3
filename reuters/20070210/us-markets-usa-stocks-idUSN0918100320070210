 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Friday after Countrywide Financial Corp. became the latest mortgage lender to warn of rising defaults, while chip maker Micron Technology Inc.'s poor forecasts shook the tech sector. 


 Countrywide, the No. 1 U.S. mortgage lender, said foreclosures hit their highest since at least 2002, while delinquencies hovered near a five-year high, fanning concern over the erosion of the U.S. housing market after two of the top three U.S. subprime mortgage lenders warned on Thursday about the impact of bad loans on their bottom line. Investors were jolted after Britain's HSBC Holdings Plc and New Century Financial Corp. issued their warnings, which punished shares of major U.S. banks like Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase & Co. for a second day in a row. The much anticipated market debut of Fortress Investment Group LLC, the first hedge fund to go public, did little to dispel the worries about what further deterioration in the housing market could do to the economy. "The market was looking for a reason to go down and I guess you could point to that. You could even point to oil trading above $60 a barrel," said Angel Mata, managing director of listed equity trading at Stifel Nicolaus Capital Markets in Baltimore. HSBC "obviously had an effect on the psychology of the market here," Mata said. Micron said it believes prices for memory chips used in consumer electronics will fall 30 percent to 40 percent this quarter from the last one. That projection sent Micron's stock down more than 3 percent in their biggest one-day percentage slide in more than three months. The Dow Jones industrial average slid 56.80 points, or 0.45 percent, to end at 12,580.83. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index dropped 10.25 points, or 0.71 percent, to finish at 1,438.06. The Nasdaq Composite Index tumbled 28.85 points, or 1.16 percent, to close at 2,459.82. For the week, the Dow fell 0.57 percent, while the S&P 500 declined 0.71 percent and the Nasdaq slipped 0.65 percent. FINANCIAL STOCKS TUMBLE Financial services stocks were the S&P 500's worst-performing sector. MasterCard Inc. shares slid almost 10 percent after the credit card company cautioned that operating margin growth may slow this year. Shares of MasterCard closed at $103.60, down $11.14, their worst day since the company went public in May. Citigroup's stock ended at $53.40, down $1.04, for a decline of 2 percent, making this its worst week since the 3 percent slide in the week of July 16. Citigroup was the most negative influence on the S&P 500. It also was among the blue-chip Dow's biggest decliners. Shares of JPMorgan fell 1.0 percent, or 51 cents, to close at $50.42 on the New York Stock Exchange, while Washington Mutual shares dropped almost 2 percent, or 82 cents, to $43.35. JPMorgan also dragged on both the Dow and the S&P 500. One bright spot was Fortress Investment Group LLC, the first U.S.-listed hedge fund, whose stock soared as high as $35.49 -- up 92 percent from its initial offering price at $18.50 -- in a debut that many believe could encourage other hedge funds to go public. Fortress shares surged 67.6 percent, or $12.50, to end at $31.00 on the NYSE. The stock was the Big Board's top percentage gainer. SEMIS FALL ON MICRON'S VIEW A sell-off in the semiconductor sector began in the early afternoon, triggered by Micron's dismal forecast for a plunge in the prices of memory chips. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange's index of semiconductor stocks, which includes Micron, fell 1.38 percent. On the Nasdaq, shares of Intel Corp., the world's largest chip maker, fell 1.5 percent, or 33 cents, to $21.07 after Micron's negative outlook. Intel, whose stock also is among the 30 in the Dow and part of the S&P 500, dragged on those indexes as well. Micron's stock ended the session down 34 cents at $12.56 on the New York Stock Exchange. Earlier, Micron tumbled to $12.40 -- its lowest level since October 2005 -- a drop of 3.9 percent from its NYSE close on Thursday. Oil's climb above $60 a barrel also weighed on the market as the price increase revived concern among investors about the impact of higher energy costs on corporations and consumers. U.S. crude oil futures for March delivery rose 18 cents to settle at $59.89 a barrel, below its session high at $60.80 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Trading was active on the NYSE, with about 1.64 billion shares changing hands, below last year's estimated daily average of 1.84 billion, while on Nasdaq, about 2.25 billion shares traded, above last year's daily average of 2.02 billion. Declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones by a ratio of about 7 to 3 on the NYSE and by 2 to 1 on Nasdaq. (Additional reporting by  Chris Sanders  and  Caroline Valetkevitch )
