 SCOTTSDALE, Arizona  (Reuters) - The chief executive of US Airways Group Inc. was arrested on January 31 on suspicion of drunk driving and had a blood alcohol level above legal limits in Arizona, a spokesman for the Scottsdale Police Department said on Friday. 


 Police said a blood test showed Douglas Parker had an alcohol level of 0.096 percent. The legal limit for driving in Arizona is 0.080 percent. "I will accept the consequences of my actions, and I will ensure that it doesn't happen again," Parker said in a statement. "In this instance, my actions have not reflected well on US Airways and for that, I apologize." US Airways issued an additional statement from Parker, 45, late on Friday in which the executive admitted to three other alcohol-related incidents in his twenties. "Two involved driving under the influence (one a misdemeanor) and the third occurred in college while a passenger in a friend's car," Parker said in the statement. Parker said he was "irresponsible at times" in his twenties but said he "got my wake-up call long ago as I got married, had kids, and assumed positions of responsibility at work." He said his incident last week was "a mistake, not a trend," and that events from 15 and 20 years ago did not reflect on the person he is today. The January 31 arrest occurred hours after Parker pulled US Airways' bid to acquire bankrupt Delta Air Lines Inc. after Delta creditors rejected the bid. Police said that officers on a drunk driving task force clocked Parker driving 65 m.p.h. in a 45 m.p.h. speed range in his BMW in Scottsdale, a city in the Phoenix valley area. "When the officer pulled Parker over, he noticed the smell of alcohol on his breath, and that he had watery eyes and slurry speech," said Mark Clark, a spokesman for the Scottsdale Police Department. Clark said officers arrested Parker for suspected drunk driving, then sent him home in a taxi. (Additional reporting by  Sinead Carew  and  Chris Reiter  in New York)
