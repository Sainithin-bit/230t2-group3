 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - Attorneys for those injured in the deadly 2005 explosion at BP Plc.'s ( BP.L ) giant Texas refinery can question company Chief Executive John Browne, a Texas appeals court said in an opinion issued on Friday. 


 A BP spokesman said the company was reviewing the opinion. "We're weighing our options," said BP's Neil Chapman. "As we've said before Lord Browne doesn't have any unique knowledge of the events leading up to the explosion." The Texas First Court of Appeals in October stayed a motion to depose Browne sought by attorneys for those injured in the explosion issued by a Texas judge in Galveston, Texas. A leading plaintiff's attorney said the decision bolstered the cases of those suing BP. "The ruling is unique in that it is rare for a CEO of a major company to be forced to testify against his will, lending further support to our long-standing contention that Lord Browne was directly involved in decision-making roles that contributed to this horrible tragedy," said attorney Brent Coon. "Hopefully his deposition will shed further light on the full extent of his knowledge," he said. BP has settled lawsuits brought by survivors of the 15 people killed in the March 23, 2005, explosion at an octane-enhancing unit of the 460,000 barrel per day (bpd) capacity refinery in Texas City, Texas. The first of hundreds of lawsuits by those injured in the explosion are scheduled to begin trial this spring if BP cannot reach settlements. BP has set aside up to $1.6 billion to settle lawsuits arising from the explosion, which injured more than 170 people. BP has claimed responsibility for the explosion, which federal safety investigators and an independent panel have said happened because of a lack of attention to the risk of massive destruction from the failure of refinery equipment. Browne is set to resign at the end of July and is scheduled to be replaced by BP's exploration and production chief Tony Hayward.
