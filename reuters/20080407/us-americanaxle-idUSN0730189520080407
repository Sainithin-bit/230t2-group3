 DETROIT  (Reuters) - American Axle & Manufacturing Holdings ( AXL.N ) on Monday said it would resume full negotiations between company representatives and a bargaining team for the United Auto Workers union on Wednesday. 

 A meeting between American Axle Chief Executive Dick Dauch and UAW President Ron Gettelfinger on Monday afternoon in Detroit broke an impasse in a six-week old strike by some 3,650 union-represented workers at the parts supplier when both sides agreed to resume full talks this week. "It was very productive," American Axle spokeswoman Renee Rogers said of the meeting between Gettelfinger and Dauch. Full negotiations between bargaining teams for both sides broke off on March 11 and only sporadic talks have been held since. Rogers said UAW officials from the Detroit-based company's five local bargaining units would rejoin the talks on Wednesday. The strike has idled production at some 30 facilities operated by General Motors Corp ( GM.N ), which accounts for about 80 percent of American Axle's sales.
