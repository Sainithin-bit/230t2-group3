 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Consumer borrowing rose by a smaller-than-expected $5.16 billion in February as borrowing for big-ticket items moderated, a Federal Reserve report showed on Monday. 

 Overall February consumer credit rose at an annual rate of 2.44 percent to a total of $2.540 trillion. The January increase was revised upward to $10.29 billion from an originally reported gain of $6.9 billion. Analysts polled by Reuters were expecting a $5.5 billion rise in consumer borrowing for February. Non-revolving credit, which includes closed-end loans for big-ticket items like cars, boats, college educations and holidays, rose $497 million, or by 0.38 percent, to $1.588 trillion. This compares with a revised January rise of $4.72 billion. Revolving credit, made up of credit and charge cards, rose $4.66 billion, or by 5.91 percent, to $951.68 billion in February. This compares to a January increase of $5.57 billion. (Reporting by  Mark Felsenthal ; Editing by  Andrea Ricci )
