 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The chairman of a U.S. congressional committee on Monday asked the Federal Reserve for details about its hiring of BlackRock Financial Management ( BLK.N ) to run the $30 billion portfolio tied to the Fed's financing of a buyout of investment bank Bear Stearns BSC.N. 

 Amid intensifying scrutiny of the Fed's unusual role in the acquisition of troubled Bear Stearns by Wall Street rival JPMorgan Chase ( JPM.N ), Rep. Henry Waxman, in a letter to New York Fed President Timothy Geithner, wrote that the assets in the portfolio "appear to belong to the federal taxpayer." "Only limited details are known about the Federal Reserve's understandings with BlackRock," said the California Democrat, who chairs the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. "It appears that BlackRock is serving as a government contractor providing complex financial services," he said. Waxman raised questions about the lack of competitive bidding when the Fed chose BlackRock, as well as an "apparent lack of concrete terms with BlackRock." He asked Geithner to supply information by April 18 on BlackRock's selection; any plans for seeking competing bids; the terms of the job; the Fed's oversight program, and the names of BlackRock employees involved in doing the work. The New York Fed said on Thursday that it would report on a quarterly basis the value of assets held as collateral for a $29 billion credit line to JPMorgan to buy Bear Stearns. The portfolio contains collateralized mortgage obligations, most of which are obligations of government-sponsored entities such as Fannie Mae FNM.N and Freddie Mac FRE.N, as well as asset-backed securities, adjustable-rate mortgages, commercial mortgage-backed securities and other loan obligations. Bear valued the assets in mid-March at $30 billion. "If BlackRock does its job well, the taxpayers will be made whole or even experience a gain. If BlackRock is not successful, the taxpayers stand to lose billions of dollars," Waxman said. (Reporting by  Kevin Drawbaugh ; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)
