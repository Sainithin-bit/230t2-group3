 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The White House on Monday said it was too soon to discuss the need for a second economic stimulus package because the first one had not been fully implemented yet. 

 "It's too soon to talk about a second stimulus package when you haven't even implemented the first stimulus package," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said. President George W. Bush was scheduled to meet later on Monday with owners of small- and mid-sized business owners to talk about the economic stimulus package that will deliver tax rebate checks in May.
