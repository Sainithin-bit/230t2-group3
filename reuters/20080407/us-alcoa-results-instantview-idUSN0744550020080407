 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Aluminum producer Alcoa Inc ( AA.N ) said on Monday that first-quarter profit was cut in half from a year ago because of higher energy and raw material costs and a weak dollar, which offset a surge in the metal's price. 

 Income from continuing operations, excluding restructuring and tax impacts, were $361 million, or 44 cents per share. Revenue fell to $7.4 billion from $7.9 billion a year earlier, Alcoa said. Analysts on average were expecting earnings of 49 cents per share and revenue of $7.388 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. The price of aluminum on the London Metal Exchange slipped below $2,500 per metric ton at the beginning of the year but has risen since February and on Monday gained $17 to $2,970.  COMMENTS:  PAUL MOOMAW, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, HESTER CAPITAL MANAGEMENT IN AUSTIN, TEXAS: "There was a negative effect from currency translation in the quarter that was significant. Alcoa is not the same as other multinationals in that a lot of their production is sold in dollars, and a lot of their costs are not in dollars." "This is a company in transition. They completed the sale of their packaging unit, they bought in some of their own stock, they kept the balance sheet reasonably strong. They will benefit from higher aluminum prices in the second quarter." "There are things to look forward to. The share count is down, the balance sheet is fine, we've got a simpler company than we had a year ago, and we have new management coming in. And we've got higher prices that they will benefit from in the next few months."  BRIAN HICKS, CO-MANAGER, U.S. GLOBAL RESOURCES FUND "We weren't expecting a whole lot. Our view is that we are still optimistic about aluminum and constructive on Alcoa. It looks like there is international demand for aluminum that is picking up, and China looks to be cutting back on production. We think that aluminum prices there seems to be more room to go on the upside." "I think the fundamentals for aluminum could be quite strong over the next couple of years. That's the way we're looking at it -- we're not so focused on near-term quarterly results. I think the Street might allow for this mishap."  PETER SCHIFF, PRESIDENT OF EURO PACIFIC CAPITAL "I think this is more of an indication that inflation is a bigger problem than people understand. It's driving costs higher, and even companies that you would think would benefit from it are having trouble because the cost pressures are very strong. But ultimately you're going to get big increases out of Alcoa in their prices as well."  BRUCE ZARO, CHIEF TECHNICAL STRATEGIST, DELTA GLOBAL ADVISORS, BOSTON: "It looks like a pretty solid quarter. Everybody knows the dollar has been weakened, and that's one of the most difficult things, especially for the commodity makers, to estimate how that's going to impact the numbers at the end of the quarter. "They would have reported 52 cents if they didn't have that, so you can understand and excuse that. The revenue was in-line. But more important was that their margins improved by 340 basis points-- that's significant."  SCOTT BURNS, ANALYST, MORNINGSTAR "That it was going to be a tough quarter was not a surprise, given the currency problems. "It looks like the problem is the currency, but what really should be noted is that at the end of the quarter, LME aluminum went from about $2,500 per ton to $3,000 per ton, which is about 20 percent, so I expect things to be better going forward. "There's not really a demand problem, (and) aerospace is still strong. When the LME goes up, Alcoa goes."  REBECCA ENGMANN DARST, EQUITY OPTIONS ANALYST AT INTERACTIVE BROKERS GROUP IN GREENWICH, CONN "Some options traders may have been expecting a larger-than-usual stock move up or down in the aftermath of Alcoa's earnings," said Rebecca Engmann Darst, equity options analyst at Interactive Brokers Group. The price of the at-the-money April $37.50 straddle was $3.08 at the close, which prices in a stock swing of more than $3 on the back of the news. "But what is notable is that traders sold the April $40 call strikes and bought puts at the $37.50 strike in April and May in anticipation of a drop in stock price in Alcoa. Many analysts were chatting up the bear argument in Alcoa on Monday, citing that the company could suffer from the weak dollar, unlike other commodity producers, and lower global metals demand."  RICHARD SPARKS, SENIOR EQUITIES ANALYST AT OPTIONS RESEARCH  FIRM SCHAEFFER'S INVESTMENT RESEARCH IN CINCINNATI, OHIO. "It looks like today's option activity in Alcoa on the International Securities Exchange, the largest U.S. equity options market, was weighted slightly on the put side as its call-to-put ratio on Monday stood at about 81 new calls traded for every 100 puts." These put positions, which allow investors to sell the underlying shares, appear to be downside directional bets, he said. "This is in contrast to its 10-day average of 5.44, which is more than five times the number of new calls bought compared to puts."  ALAIN BELDA, ALCOA CHAIRMAN AND CEO, IN A RELEASE. "Upstream margins were squeezed by higher energy costs and a weaker U.S. dollar, but the global market remains tight and prices are near historic highs, primarily driven by demand in Asia, especially China. "Our engineered products and solutions business delivered its strongest quarter ever, driven by robust aerospace and industrial gas turbine sales and productivity improvements. Market fundamentals remain strong and we are well positioned to boost returns when the North American and European economies rebound."
