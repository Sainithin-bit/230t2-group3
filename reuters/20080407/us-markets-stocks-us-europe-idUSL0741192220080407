 LONDON  (Reuters) - Stock futures pointed to a stronger open on Monday, suggesting that Wall Street would extend gains made last week, as investors focused on results from aluminum group Alcoa ( AA.N ) and consumer credit figures. 

 By 5:20 a.m. EDT, futures for the Dow Jones the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 were up by 0.6-0.8 percent, and European shares were trading nearly 1 percent higher. Consumer credit data for February is expected at 3:00 p.m. EDT. Analysts forecast a $5.5 billion increase in borrowing, according to Reuters Estimates, against a $6.9 billion rise for last month, suggesting a decline in spending and tighter lending in the face of concern about a recession in the U.S. economy. Some analysts expect the data to cause volatility, but say any positive momentum will come from the generally bullish sentiment seen last week and so far in Europe. "A lot of the strength we've seen has been lifted from the strength we've seen in the European markets," said David Jones, chief market analyst at IG Index. "The only thing today (which) could cause volatility, is the consumer credit numbers ... on the Dow the big level people are going to be watching is 12,800 (points) and that's the highs from February," he said. "We've seen the market run out of steam twice from that ... it would be interesting to see what happens when it pushes up to there," he added. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  ended Friday 0.13 percent lower at 12,609.42 points, while the S&P 500  .SPX  gained 0.08 percent, and the Nasdaq  .IXIC  rose 0.32 percent. Aluminum producer, Alcoa ( AA.N ) will release its results after the bell. First-quarter earnings estimates for U.S. companies have fallen sharply since the period began as expectations for a recession have grown. S&P 500 companies are now expected to show an 8.1 percent decline in earnings, compared with analysts' projections at the beginning of the quarter for a 4.7 percent gain in earnings, according to Reuters Estimates. JOB DATA SHOCK The S&P 500 rose 4.2 percent last week, but ended the week on a tame note after weak jobs data revealed the highest unemployment rate in the U.S. economy in two and a half years, while non-farm employment fell by 80,000 jobs in March.  Former Federal Reserve Chairman, Alan Greenspan, was reported on Sunday as saying there was more than a 50 percent chance the United States could go into recession. Greenspan told Spanish newspaper El Pais that the world's largest economy was still yet to enter a phase marked by sharp falls in orders, strong rises in unemployment and intensive weakening of the economy.  Greenspan's comments follow those made by his successor, Ben Bernanke last week, who indicated a recession in the U.S. economy was possible. Since mid-September, the Federal Reserve has slashed interest rates by 3 percentage points, and further rate cuts are widely expected. On Sunday, a U.S. Treasury official told Reuters that plans from the Financial Stability Forum (FSF) to buy up distressed mortgages to ease the global credit crisis would likely receive a cool reception from the Group of Seven (G7) industrialized countries when they meet on Friday. The FSF, which comprises central banks and finance ministries with major exchanges, drafted an options paper that includes a plan to recapitalize banks and repurchase mortgages with the possible use of taxpayers' funds.
