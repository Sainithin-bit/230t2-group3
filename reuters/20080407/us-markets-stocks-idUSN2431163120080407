 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Stocks were little changed on Monday as rising oil prices stoked fears that corporate profits will suffer, overshadowing optimism the credit crisis is easing on news that Washington Mutual Inc was close to securing a $5 billion investment. 

 Alcoa Inc ( AA.N ) was the biggest drag on the Dow on Monday as investors shifted their focus to the first-quarter earnings reporting period. After the bell, Alcoa said its first-quarter profit was halved from a year ago because of energy costs and the weak dollar, but shares of the aluminum producer edged up, largely on expectations for higher metal prices. Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD.N ), however, darkened the mood after the bell, saying it will cut 10 percent of its work force after first-quarter sales fell more than it had expected. Shares of AMD, the second largest maker of computer processors, fell 2.7 percent to $6.17 in extended trading, more than giving up gains of 1.8 percent in regular trading. Other industrial shares also declined as oil prices rose to within striking distance of a new record as several refineries prepared for the U.S. summer driving season, boosting supply concerns. General Electric ( GE.N ) was the top drag on the S&P, shedding 0.8 percent to $37.26. Major stock indexes were higher for most on the day, boosted by the financial sector on news that Washington Mutual ( WM.N ) is close to securing a capital injection, feeding investor hopes the worst of credit crisis is over. "Those assumptions will face a reality check as companies report first-quarter earnings over coming weeks beginning tonight with Alcoa and as you get second quarter guidance," said Jim Awad, chairman of W.P. Stewart & Co. Ltd. in New York. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was up 3.01 points, or 0.02 percent, ending at 12,612.43. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was up 2.12 points, or 0.15 percent, finishing at 1,372.52. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was down 6.15 points, or 0.26 percent, at 2,364.83. The Alcoa release kicked off the first-quarter reporting period, with earnings for S&P 500 companies expected to decline 11.8 percent, according to Reuters Estimates. Despite Alcoa's relatively large drop in first quarter earnings, investors took the news in stride. "I think the fundamentals for aluminum could be quite strong over the next couple of years," said Brian Hicks, co-manager at U.S. Global Resources Fund. "That's the way we're looking at it -- we're not so focused on near-term quarterly results. I think the Street might allow for this mishap." Shares of Alcoa rose 0.6 percent to $37.67 in after-hours trading, after having closed down 4 percent at $37.44 in regular New York Stock Exchange trade. Shares of WaMu, the largest U.S. savings and loan company, surged 29 percent to $13.12, on hopes the investment would ease the company's need for capital as losses from subprime mortgages and other loans soar. For details see <ID:nN07475686>. The WaMu news pushed up the financial sector, which had been suffering as a result of taking billions of dollars of losses from bad mortgages, and helped to lift the Standard & Poor's 500 index for the fifth trading day of the last six. The S&P financial index .GSPF gained 0.98 percent. Cisco Systems Inc was the second-biggest drag on the S&P 500, falling 1.85 percent to $23.94, after JPMorgan Securities cut its revenue estimates on the network equipment maker. Some investor focus, however, was slowly shifting to the positive effects from fiscal and monetary stimulus, turning away from fear and where the next credit blow-up might occur. Since the Federal Reserve in mid March said it would help to finance JPMorgan Chase's takeover of Bear Stearns, the S&P 500 has risen around 7 percent. "We believe we are now in a 'base-building' phase," said Bob Doll, global chief investment officer for equities at BlackRock. "The negatives in the market are becoming more transparent, which is key to establishing a bottom," said Doll, who helps to oversee $1.36 trillion in assets. However, any rebound in the market since early last week when Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEH.N said it had strong demand for a share offering has lacked strong conviction. the U.S. economy was still sending negative signals, particularly on Friday, when a report showed the biggest monthly decline in five years. "It's likely that the Fed created a bottom but that doesn't mean we're off to the races. There will probably be more pain to come," said Awad at W.P. Stewart & Co. Ltd. Volume was relatively light on the New York Stock Exchange, with about 1.3 billion shares changing hands, below last year's estimated daily average of roughly 1.9 billion. On the Nasdaq, about 1.7 billion shares changed hands, below last year's daily average of 2.17 billion. On the NYSE advancers were beating decliners 17 to 14, while on the Nasdaq decliners were just barely beating advancers 15 to 14. (Editing by Leslie Adler)
