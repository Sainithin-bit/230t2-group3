 SEOUL  (Reuters) - Flat screen maker LG Display Co Ltd 
( 034220.KS ) and two smaller Taiwanese rivals are expected to 
post strong first-quarter earnings as the booming market for 
thinner, sleeker TVs boosted panel demand amid tight supplies. 

  Makers of liquid crystal display (LCD) panels saw solid 
demand and stable pricing in the usually-slow first quarter, 
helped by drastic investment cuts after a painful panel glut in 
2006. The investment cutback will continue to limit capacity 
throughout 2008, analysts said.  Earnings are set to increase further in the second and 
third quarters with sales of LCD TVs to replace bulky tubes 
picking up pace ahead of Beijing Olympics this summer.  "The LCD industry in 2008 should enjoy the sort of boom 
that has not been observed since 2004," said John Soh, an 
analyst Goodmorning Shinhan Securities. "LCD TVs and notebook 
computers are becoming widespread globally, leading the trend. 
LG Display should see its best results ever this year."  Analysts expect the market to tilt toward oversupply again 
at the end of the year, but many say the scale of excess 
production would be small, with TV demand growing fast.  South Korea's LG Display ( LPL.N ), formerly LG.Philips LCD, 
is forecast to report on Thursday a 715.5 billion won ($735 
million) net profit in the first quarter, according to 8 
analysts polled by Reuters.  The profit marks a rebound from a 169 billion won net loss 
from the year-earlier period and compares with the record 760 
billion won earned in the October-December quarter.  Besides strong demand, the weaker won  KRW=  currency and 
improved production yields also boosted earnings at LG Display, 
the world's No. 2 maker of large-sized LCD screens.  First-quarter sales are expected at 4.18 trillion won, up 
sharply from 2.72 trillion won a year earlier.  The average panel price at the company likely fell around 5 
percent in the first quarter from the previous quarter. TV 
panel prices were steady and notebook computer screens posted 
smaller-than-expected declines, analysts said.  The average panel price fell 9 percent in the year-earlier 
quarter.  LG Display trails home rival Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 
( 005930.KS ) but ranks ahead of Taiwan's AU Optronics Corp 
( 2409.TW ) ( AUO.N ), the world's No. 3.  AU is expected to post on April 22 a first-quarter net 
profit of T$14.7 billion ($483.5 million), a strong reversal 
from a year-ago loss of T$5.1 billion although lower than the 
record profit of T$33.1 billion from the fourth quarter of 
2007, according to Reuters Estimates.  Smaller Taiwanese maker Chi Mei Optoelectronics Corp 
3009.TW likely earned T$9.3 billion in the January-March 
quarter, swinging from a year-ago loss of T$1.1 billion, 
Reuters Estimates showed. Chi Mei, which will report earnings 
on April 29, booked a net profit of T$20.1 billion in the 
fourth quarter.
  NEW CAPACITY IN 2009  After curbing spending in 2007, the industry is cranking up 
capacity and will face several new, bigger production lines 
coming onstream in South Korea and Taiwan mostly in the first 
half of 2009. More capacity is expected later from Japan.  The slowing U.S. economy darkens the outlook somewhat, 
although demand from emerging markets, mostly for 32-inch or 
smaller size LCD TVs to replace cathode-ray TVs, is robust.  "There's still room for LCD companies to adjust their 
ramp-up schedules as the North American TV market seems to be 
slowing," said Lee Hak-moo, an analyst at Mirae Asset 
Securities.  However, any negative impact from the new capacity is 
likely to be mitigated by the overall market's growth, analysts 
said.  Research firm iSuppli forecasts worldwide LCD TV shipments 
to reach 100.1 million units in 2008, up from 78.5 million in 
2007. The number should reach 193.9 million in 2012, it 
predicts.  LG Display is expected to more than double its net profit 
in 2008 to 2.7 trillion won, according to Reuters Estimates.  Shares in LG Display, which came under pressure from a 
stake sale by Philips ( PHG.AS ), fell 10 percent in the first 
quarter, in line with the broader market's  .KS11  10 percent 
loss.  ($1=973.5 Won)  ($1=30.40 Taiwan Dollar)  (Additional reporting by Baker Li in TAIPEI; Editing by
