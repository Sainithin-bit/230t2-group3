 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Top leaders of The United Auto Workers and American Axle & Manufacturing Holdings Inc ( AXL.N ) are to meet on Monday for the first time in months in what may be a positive development toward ending the union's nearly six-week-old U.S. strike against the auto parts supplier. 

 UAW President Ron Gettelfinger and American Axle Chief Executive Dick Dauch have not met since negotiations opened in December. About 3,650 UAW workers at American Axle have been on strike, hampering production at the parts maker and its main customer, General Motors Corp ( GM.N ), where some 30 plants have been idled or partly idled. American Axle spokeswoman Renee Rogers confirmed that Dauch and Gettelfinger would meet, but provided no other details. A union representative could not be reached for comment. "I think most people would interpret it as a positive move," said Harold Stack, director of the labor studies center at Wayne State University. "Hopefully they will get into serious negotiations. Negotiations will hopefully take place at the bargaining table and not in the press." Intensive talks broke off March 11 and the two sides have met only sporadically since, with both sides arguing their cases through press interviews. Gettelfinger told Reuters last week there had been little progress in the talks and blasted "excessive compensation" paid to Dauch over the years. Dauch is a co-founder of American Axle, which investors bought out of GM in 1994. American Axle has said its hourly labor costs average more than $70, about three times higher than rivals, and without steep cuts in exchange for buyouts or some other payments, it would have to close the five striking U.S. plants. The union has said American Axle failed to provide enough details to evaluate the company's demands for wage and benefit cuts. American Axle provided additional financial information to the UAW last week at the union's request. Members of the UAW's negotiating committee met over the weekend in Detroit, but local representatives from New York and southwestern Michigan went home afterward. UAW Local 235 President Adrian King told Detroit's News and Free Press newspapers the information was incomplete. The union had filed a grievance with federal labor regulators, saying the company had been reluctant to share information with the UAW.
