 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Halliburton Co ( HAL.N ) Chairman and Chief Executive Officer David Lesar took home $14.8 million in compensation in 2007, a drop from the package of more than $16 million he earned the previous year. 

 In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the world's No. 2 oilfield services company said Lesar was paid a salary of $1.3 million and non-equity incentives of $7.4 million and was given stocks and options worth $5.1 million. He also was given nearly $1 million in other compensation, including $157,000 for personal use of the company airplane, $7,100 per month for security and $52,000 to cover his costs to move to Dubai to open another company headquarters. Lesar, 54, also reaped an additional $11 million from exercising previously awarded stocks and options. (Reporting by  Matt Daily ; Editing by  Brian Moss )
