 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The cost of protecting Washington Mutual's ( WM.N ) debt with credit default swaps fell 19 percent on Monday after the Wall Street Journal reported that private equity firm TPG and others were near a deal to invest $5 billion in the savings and loan. 

 Five-year debt insurance costs on Washington Mutual fell by about 72 basis points to about 302.5 basis points, or $302,500 a year to protect $10 million of debt, according to data from Markit Intraday.  (Reporting by  Dena Aubin ; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
