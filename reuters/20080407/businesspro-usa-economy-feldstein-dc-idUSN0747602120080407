 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Martin Feldstein, who leads the group 
that is considered the arbiter of U.S. recessions, said on 
Monday that he personally believes the economy has been sliding 
into a recession since December or January. 

  "I think that December/January was the peak and that we 
have been sliding into recession ever since then," Feldstein, 
the president of the National Bureau of Economic Research, said 
on CNBC television.  Feldstein said he believes that the recession will linger. 
"I think it could go on longer" than the "last two recessions 
(which) lasted eight months peak to trough," he said, adding 
the current recession could last about twice as long.  He also said the first quarter U.S. gross domestic product 
number will be a "misleading" number in that it may not reflect 
the economy was in a recession in the first three months of the 
year.  The NBER, a non-profit research organization, typically 
declares start and end dates for U.S. recessions. The group has 
not officially declared the U.S. is in a recession.  (Reporting by  Chris Reese  and  John Parry ; Editing by Tom
