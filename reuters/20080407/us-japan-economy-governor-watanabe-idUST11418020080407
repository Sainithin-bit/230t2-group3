 (Reuters) - The Japanese government it considering nominating Hiroshi Watanabe, a confident, English-speaking former senior finance ministry official as deputy governor of the Bank of Japan, but that may just reignite a row over links between the ministry and the central bank. 

 The main opposition Democratic Party and allies that control parliament's upper house have already vetoed two former finance ministry bureaucrats for top BOJ positions and Watanabe may become the third. While the government sees experience in the government bureaucracy as valuable at the central bank, the opposition says it fears a loss of monetary policy independence at the BOJ. Ichiro Ozawa, the leader of the main opposition Democratic Party, has signaled his opposition to Watanabe, prompting speculation that Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda may postpone plans to confirm acting governor Massaki Shirakawa as permanent governor and bring in Watanabe as his deputy. Here are five facts on Watanabe: -- A former currency policy tsar at the Ministry of Finance and well versed in international negotiations, 58-year-old Watanabe is currently an adviser at a semi-government research institution, the Japan Center for International Finance. He has recently taken up a position as a professor at Hitotsubashi University's graduate school, teaching some seminars including one in English on the global financial environment. -- Before retiring from the ministry, Watanabe served as vice finance minister for international affairs from 2004 to 2007, during which he said he believed in letting markets determine currency rates. Unlike his predecessors, he never intervened in the currency market while in office, although his time in charge saw the yen stay relatively stable. For that reason, Watanabe said he was sometimes called "Mr. No Action." -- Some say he believed in the need for the BOJ to normalize very low interest rates when the economy was doing well a few years back, but his current views on monetary policy are unclear. While at the ministry, he publicly stuck to the government's standard line that monetary policy was the BOJ's prerogative. -- Initially a tax expert at the ministry, Watanabe also served as an assistant to former heavyweight Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa. Since leaving the ministry, Watanabe has met Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda and advised him on recent international monetary and financial issues. -- Independent, confident and a fluent English speaker, Watanabe has spent several months speaking at seminars in Japan and abroad. He likes preparing his own presentation materials, using colorful graphs and satirical cartoons. He is also a big fan of mystery stories and has written a book using mysteries from around the world as a way to look into various cultures. (Reporting by  Yoko Nishikawa ; Editing by  Rodney Joyce )
