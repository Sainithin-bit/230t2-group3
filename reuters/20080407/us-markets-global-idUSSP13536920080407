 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks pared solid gains to close little changed on Monday after a jump in crude oil raised fears about corporate profits and curbed enthusiasm that a potential capital infusion at the largest U.S. thrift may mean the worst of a worldwide credit crisis is over. 

 Gold futures rallied to a one-week high as rising crude prices stirred inflation fears, while the dollar rose. U.S. Treasury debt prices slid as a perceived ebbing of the credit crisis that has battered financial markets for months cut demand for low-risk investments. Many investors shifted their focus away from the recovering financial sector to the first-quarter earnings reporting period, which begins in earnest after the close with the release of Alcoa Inc ( AA.N ) results. Speculation that the U.S. recession will be mild, the credit crisis is winding down and third-quarter earnings will be great was tested on Monday, the first day of the first-quarter reporting season. "Those assumptions will face a reality check as companies report first-quarter earnings over coming weeks, beginning tonight with Alcoa, and as you get second-quarter guidance," said Jim Awad, chairman of W.P. Stewart & Co. Ltd. in New York. "It's likely that the Fed created a bottom but that doesn't mean we're off to the races. There will probably be more pain to come," he said. Alcoa ( AA.N ) shares were the biggest drag on the Dow, falling 4 percent and contributing more than double that of any other component of the 30-share index. Other industrial shares suffered as oil prices rose to just shy of a new record as several refineries prepared for the U.S. summer driving season, boosting supply concerns. GE ( GE.N ) also fell, making it the top drag on the S&P. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  closed up 3.01 points, or 0.02 percent, at 12,612.43. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  rose 2.14 points, or 0.16 percent, to 1,372.54. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  gained 6.15 points, or 0.26 percent, to 2,364.83. Major U.S. stock indices spent most the session holding solid gains on news that Washington Mutual Inc ( WM.N ) was close to securing a $5 billion cash infusion. That fed market hopes that the Federal Reserve in mid-March had stabilized markets by helping JPMorgan Chase to take over Bear Stearns. Financial stocks helped shares in Europe close higher after Merrill Lynch raised Swiss bank UBS ( UBSN.VX )( UBS.N ) to a "buy." Euro zone government bonds fell, pushing the 10-year yield to near six-week highs as investors who are increasingly confident that the worst of the credit crisis may be nearing an end turned to riskier assets like stocks. "We had a good performance by Asian equities overnight, which itself is indicative of resurgent risk appetite ... Equity strength has continued in Europe and the U.S., which has taken the shine off the now characteristic safe-haven bid for fixed income," said Richard McGuire, fixed income strategist at RBC Capital Markets. European shares advanced as rising metals prices and a favorable research note boosted mining stocks, while reasonable stock valuations made shares in Europe attractive. European shares trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of about 10 and a dividend yield of about 3.5 percent, said Dennis Nacken, capital markets analyst at Allianz Global Investors. Shares in diversified miner Anglo American ( AAL.L ) rose nearly 4 percent after Goldman Sachs added the stock to its "conviction buy" list and upgraded the European metals and mining sector to "attractive" from "neutral." The DJ Stoxx basic resources index .SXPP rose 3.1 percent, making it the day's top sectoral performer. The FTSEurofirst 300 index  .FTEU3  of top European shares closed unofficially 0.8 percent higher at 1,329.37 points, having risen by more than 4 percent last week. Asian shares also gained, with resources companies benefiting from stronger metals and oil prices. Tokyo's Nikkei  .N225  rose 1.3 percent, while stocks elsewhere in Asia, as measured by MSCI's index .MIAPJ0000PUS gained 1.06 percent. Asia ex-Japan stocks are still down 10 percent this year. Before U.S. stocks slid late in the session, a global stock rally reversed Friday's rush into bonds after a government report showed U.S. payrolls suffered their biggest monthly loss in five years in March. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was down 25/32 to yield 3.5621 percent. The 2-year U.S. Treasury note fell 8/32 to yield 1.9441 percent. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond was down 30/32 to yield 4.3644 percent. Oil rose nearly $3, just past $109 a barrel as a fire at a Neste Oil refinery in Finland stirred fuel supply concerns. The news pushed prices for London gas oil, a distillate fuel closely related to diesel and heating oil, to a record $1,005 a tonne and led U.S. heating oil and crude prices sharply higher in New York, dealers said. "It's the gas oil situation in Europe that's pushing up NYMEX heating oil," said Tom Knight, a trader at Truman Arnold. U.S. crude CLc1 settled up $2.86 to $109.09 a barrel after touching $109.48 earlier in the day. London Brent crude LCOc1 settled $2.24 higher at $107.14 a barrel. New York gold futures rallied to a one-week high as rising crude oil prices stirred inflation fears and the International Monetary Fund was set to announce plans to consider revamping its income model by selling part of its gold. Gold for June delivery GCM8 settled up $13.60, or 1.5 percent, at $926.80 an ounce. Currency traders said they were reluctant to buy the euro aggressively ahead of Thursday's European Central Bank policy meeting and the G7 nations' gathering late in the week. The dollar rose against a basket of major trading-partner currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index .DXY up 0.37 percent at 72.199. The euro fell 0.20 percent to $1.5704, while against the yen, the dollar rose 0.91 percent to 102.44. While sentiment toward the dollar had improved, worries about the overall health of the U.S. economy continued to cast a pall over the market, restricting the greenback's gains, they said. "Ahead of the G7 and ECB (meetings), people are not going to get aggressive in terms of buying the euro," said Brian Dolan, chief currency strategist at Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey.
