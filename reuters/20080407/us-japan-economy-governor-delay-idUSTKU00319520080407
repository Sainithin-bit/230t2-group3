 TOKYO  (Reuters) - The Japanese government will likely delay its nomination of a new governor for the Bank of Japan until Monday evening, a ruling party lawmaker said. 

 "We will meet again at 5:20 p.m." (4:20 a.m. EDT), he told reporters after emerging from a meeting between lawmakers and government officials at which the government had been expected to name its candidates. (Reporting by Tokyo Economic Policy Desk)
