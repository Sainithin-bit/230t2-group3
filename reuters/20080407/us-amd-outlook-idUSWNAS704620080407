 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Advanced Micro Devices Inc ( AMD.N ) on Monday said it will cut 10 percent of its work force after first-quarter sales fell more than it had expected. 

 AMD, the second largest microprocessor maker after Intel Corp ( INTC.O ), said it expects to record a restructuring charge in the second quarter. The amounts and details of the charge are still being determined, AMD said. AMD said it expects to report first-quarter revenue of about $1.5 billion, down 15 percent from the previous quarter. It said the decrease is due to lower-than-expected sales across all business segments. (Reporting by  Philipp Gollner )
