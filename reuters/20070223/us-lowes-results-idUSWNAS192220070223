 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Home improvement retailer Lowe's Cos. ( LOW.N ) reported better-than expected earnings on Friday even as the weak U.S. housing market hurt results, and its shares rose as much as 6 percent to an all-time high as it said sales could trend upward this year. 


 "We believe our (same-store sales) performance has bottomed and we expect to see gradual improvement" in 2007, Lowe's Chairman and Chief Executive Robert Niblock said during a conference call. The No. 2 do-it-yourself retailer behind Home Depot Inc. ( HD.N ) said it sees first-quarter and full-year profit about in line with Wall Street estimates. Lowe's "was willing to put a floor on the weakness and talk about improving dynamics at the end of the year," said Sarah Henry, an investment analyst with Sovereign Asset Management. By contrast, she said, Home Depot delivered worse-than-expected results earlier this week. Lowe's shares rose $1.27, or 3.8 percent, to $34.90 in afternoon New York Stock Exchange trading, while Home Depot fell 28 cents to $40.90. Lowe's shares hit their previous record high of $34.82 in February 2006. Lowe's, based in Mooresville, North Carolina, said its outlook was based less on an expected upturn in housing than on easier comparisons. Same-store sales rose for the first half of 2006, but fell in the last half. "We've given guidance for negative (comparable-store sales) and actually a decline in earnings for the first quarter," Niblock told Reuters in an interview. "The comparisons get easier through 2007." Earnings for Lowe's were $613 million, or 40 cents a share, for the fourth quarter ended February 2, down 11.5 percent from $693 million, or 43 cents, a year earlier. The year-ago quarter included an extra week. Analysts, on average, expected 37 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Total sales in the quarter fell about 4 percent, to $10.4 billion, higher than analysts' estimates, while sales at stores open at least a year declined 5.3 percent. After adjusting for the extra week in the prior year, Lowe's said total sales rose about 5 percent for the fourth quarter. Weak home sales and construction weighed on Lowe's and Home Depot for the past year. Housing starts fell 13 percent last year, their biggest tumble in 15 years. Earlier this week, Atlanta-based Home Depot posted a 28 percent drop in fourth-quarter profit and its CEO said he does not expect a dramatic turnaround in the housing market this year. Home Depot will give its financial outlook next week at an analyst meeting. Lowe's, which has 1,385 U.S. stores and plans to enter Canada this year, cited the potential for more than 2,000 stores in North America as it expands to big U.S. cities. Niblock also told Reuters that Lowe's store count in Mexico, a market it plans to enter in 2009, could reach 50. The chain forecast per-share profit of 49 cents to 51 cents for the first quarter and $2.02 to $2.09 for the full year. Analysts expect profit of 51 cents a share for the first period and $2.03 a share for the year, according to Reuters Estimates. Some analysts questioned the Lowe's outlook, noting that it lowered estimates more than once in the past year as the housing slump worsened. "We continue to worry about comments from builders, the subprime market and Lowe's biggest competitor that the recovery may take longer," Credit Suisse analyst Gary Balter said in a research note. Lowe's stock is up 10.6 percent this year, while Home Depot's stock is about flat.
