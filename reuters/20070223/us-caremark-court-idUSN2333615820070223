 PHILADELPHIA  (Reuters) - A Delaware Chancery Court judge ruled on Friday that Caremark Rx Inc. CMX.N must delay a shareholder vote on its planned acquisition by CVS Corp. ( CVS.N ) until at least 20 days after it provides more details on the transaction. 


 The judge, however, stopped short of canceling the shareholder vote outright. Caremark's hostile suitor, Express Scripts Inc. ( ESRX.O ), and certain Caremark investors had sought a temporary restraining order to prevent the CVS-Caremark deal from proceeding as planned. The court ordered Caremark to provide more information on appraisal rights and the structure of investment banking fees. Appraisal rights give shareholders the right to refuse a buyer's offer and to seek a fair determination of the value of their shares. Caremark, which manages pharmacy benefits for corporations, has maintained its $23.7 billion deal to be acquired by drugstore chain CVS would bring more value to shareholders than Express Scripts' $27.4 billion bid. "Shareholders would suffer irreparable harm only were they to be forced to vote without knowledge of the material facts relating to the structure of bankers fees and, most importantly, their entitlement to appraisal rights," Judge William Chandler said in an order on Friday. "Although serious questions remain regarding the process surrounding the merger negotiations, this court places great trust in the decisions of informed, disinterested shareholders. Shareholders fully apprised of all relevant facts may protect themselves. They need no further intervention from this court." Caremark said it was pleased with the court's decision. "The transaction with CVS offers our shareholders significant near-term value, as well as long-term strategic and financial benefits," Caremark said. "We look forward to obtaining shareholder approval and promptly closing the merger, which has already received regulatory approval." CVS and Express Scripts were not immediately available to comment.
