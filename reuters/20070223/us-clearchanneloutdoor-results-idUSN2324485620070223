 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Outdoor advertising company Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings Inc. ( CCO.N ) posted higher quarterly profit on Friday, helped by higher revenue. 


 The San Antonio, Texas, company posted fourth-quarter net profit of $65.1 million, or 18 cents per share, up from $40.4 million, or 12 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 13 percent to $830.7 million, including a $32.4 million increase due to the movement of foreign exchange. Excluding foreign exchange effects, revenue growth would have been 9 percent, the company said. The company said revenue in the Americas region increased 10 percent in 2006, with airport revenue boosted by its acquisition of Interspace Airport Advertising in July 2006. International revenue increased 7 percent in 2006, including Clear Media, which the company began consolidating in July 2005. For the full year 2007, the company forecast "high single-digit to low double-digit growth" in operating expenses, and said capital spending would likely be $225 million to $250 million.
