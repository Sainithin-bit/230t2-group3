 NEW DELHI  (Reuters) - U.S. retail giant Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) and India's Bharti Enterprises are very close to finalizing a cash-and-carry joint venture, Bharti's chief said on Friday. 


 However, the Indian government said there were no immediate plans to ease regulations for foreign retailers, despite recent speculation that rules on foreign investment might be relaxed. "We are very close," Bharti Enterprises chairman Sunil Mittal told reporters. "We can't fix a time-frame, but we hope it will happen in the next few weeks," Mittal said, adding the legal agreement of the proposed cash-and-carry joint venture was being looked into. Asked if there may be any regulatory hurdles to the venture, which has attracted some political opposition, Mittal said: "Zero." Mittal and Wal-Mart Vice Chairman Mike Duke met Planning Commission Deputy Chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia, Farm Minister Sharad Pawar and Trade Minister Kamal Nath on Friday. Nath said there was no proposal to open up multi-brand retail to foreigners. "Whatever is there in existing government regulations will be allowed," he told reporters after meeting Mittal and Duke. "There is no FDI (foreign direct investment) in multi-brand retail. I've always said that." Foreign multi-brand retailers are only allowed to set up cash-and-carry or franchise operations in India, the route chosen by Germany's Metro AG ( MEOG.DE ), Shoprite Holdings ( SHPJ.J ) and Marks & Spencer Plc ( MKS.L ). Wal-Mart said on Thursday it was also in talks to partner Bharti on supply chain logistics and technology support, but that no specific business announcement would be made during this trip. Duke's visit sparked protests from trade unions and small shop owners, who fear job losses if the retail sector is opened up to foreign companies keen to tap India's $300 billion industry that is forecast to more than double by 2015. Bharti Retail, a wholly-owned unit of Bharti Enterprises, said earlier this week it would spend $2.5 billion by 2015 on hypermarkets, supermarkets and other stores.
