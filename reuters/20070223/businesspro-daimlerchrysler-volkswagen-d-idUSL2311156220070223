 STUTTGART, Germany  (Reuters) - Volkswagen ( VOWG.DE ), 
Europe's biggest carmaker, has no interest in acquiring 
DaimlerChrysler's DCXGn.DE loss-making U.S. arm Chrysler or 
expanding cooperation accords, a VW spokeswoman said on Friday. 


  "There is no such consideration here," she said.  DaimlerChrysler Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche said last 
week all options were open for Chrysler, which swung to a 2006 
operating loss of 1.12 billion euros ($1.47 billion) as 
consumers shunned its lineup that relied heavily on pickup 
trucks and sport utilities.  VW joins a growing list of companies to rule themselves out 
as a strategic partner for Chrysler.  South Korea's Hyundai Motor Co Ltd ( 005380.KS ), Japan's 
Mitsubishi Motors Corp ( 7211.T ), Italy's Fiat ( FIA.MI ) and the 
alliance between Renault ( RENA.PA ) and Nissan Motor Co ( 7201.T ) 
have all rejected a tie-up.  This has taken some of the steam out of DaimlerChrysler 
stock's rally since Zetsche's comments. The share eased 0.5 
percent to 53 euros by 1041 GMT -- off a 5-1/2-year high at 
56.34 on Monday -- while the DJ Stoxx European car sector index 
.SXAP slipped 0.3 percent.  Sources familiar with the matter have told Reuters that 
General Motors ( GM.N ) had opened talks with Chrysler on an 
acquisition or a strategic alliance.  (Additional reporting by  Marcel Michelson  in Paris)
