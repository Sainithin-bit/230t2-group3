 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Clear Channel Communications Inc. ( CCU.N ), which has agreed to be bought by two private equity firms and the company's founding Mays family, posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings on Friday as radio broadcasting revenue and outdoor advertising sales rose. 


 Excluding special items, the largest U.S. radio station operator earned $210.1 million, or 43 cents per share, in the fourth quarter, up from $182.7 million, or 34 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting 41 cents a share, excluding a gain from a favorable legal settlement and merger costs, according to Reuters Estimates. Net profit was $211.3 million, or 43 cents per share, down from $461.6 million, or 86 cents per share, a year earlier. Clear Channel booked a $279 million gain in the fourth quarter of 2005, when it sold its concert promotion business, now called Live Nation Inc. Revenue rose 11 percent to $1.94 billion. Radio broadcasting revenue was up 7 percent to $966.8 million, outpacing the overall market average gain of 1 percent, Miller Tabak media analyst David Joyce said. "They have a pretty good handle on how to embrace the newer world order," Joyce said, highlighting Clear Channel's advertising inventory reduction program. Clear Channel Outdoors posted a fourth-quarter profit of $65.1 million, or 18 cents a share, up from $40.4 million, or 12 cents a share a year earlier. Analysts expected the company to post a profit of 15 cents, compared to the company's profit of 17 cents, excluding the impact of foreign exchange movement. Outdoor advertising revenue rose 13 percent to $830.7 million. RADIO REVENUE 'PACING' Clear Channel, which is being acquired by Thomas H. Lee Partners LP THL.UL, Bain Capital and the Mays family for almost $19 billion, said that as of February 22, radio division revenue "pacing," or indications from the current sales environment, was seen up 1.8 percent for the first quarter and up 0.5 percent for the full year. The company said it expects 2007 capital spending of $325 million to $350 million, excluding new contracts. Clear Channel is in the process of selling 448 of its 1,150 radio stations, as well as its 42-station television group, and a bid deadline for its radio assets passed on Friday. Frank Kalil, president of Kalil and Co. Inc., which buys and sells radio and television stations and was retained by Clear Channel to sell the radio stations, said: "The interest that has been shown is everything from buying a single station in a single market to buying the entire group. We have had interest in every permutation of a transaction imaginable." He declined to elaborate further about the bids. (Additional reporting by  Megan Davies )
