 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Circuit City Stores Inc. CC.N said on Friday that its chief financial officer is leaving the company to become finance chief at Petco Animal Supplies Inc., sending shares of the consumer electronics retailer down as much as 5.1 percent. 


 Michael Foss' departure, after 3-1/2 years at the retailer, comes as Circuit City is in the midst of multiyear effort to revamp its business and win back market share from larger rival Best Buy Co. Inc. ( BBY.N ). Earlier this month, Circuit City announced a restructuring that included store closures and the departure of Chief Merchandising Officer Douglas Moore as it tries to offset gross margin pressure in the flat-panel TV business. "CEO Phil Schoonover's hand-picked team is turning over faster than we would like to see in a turnaround situation," wrote Goldman Sachs analyst Matthew Fassler in a note. "Foss' intimate knowledge of Circuit City's financials is important at a moment when the turnaround effort appears to be leaning more on cost control. In the past five years Circuit City has installed new management, sold its troubled credit card portfolio, spun off its stake in auto retailer Carmax Inc. ( KMX.N ) and improved its checkout systems. While its sales have increased, rising 11 percent this fiscal year through November 30, it reported a surprise third-quarter loss in December after cutting prices on flat-panel TVs and computers during the ultra-competitive holiday season. "I have an opportunity not unlike Circuit City a few years ago, and I am excited to pursue a new challenge," Foss, in a statement, said of his decision to leave Circuit City. Petco was acquired last year for $1.8 billion by private equity firms Texas Pacific Group and Leonard Green & Partners. Petco has been grappling with rising costs for new store openings and increasingly tough competition from rival Petsmart Inc. ( PETM.O ). Circuit City said a search for a new finance chief has started, and Foss would remain on its board until the June annual meeting. Circuit City shares were down 78 cents or 3.8 percent at $20.00 in late morning New York Stock Exchange trading after touching as low as $19.72 earlier in the session.
