 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Richard Fisher said on Friday that although inflation may have "turned the corner," he would like to see it well below 2 percent. 


 "I don't like to be pinned down on a number. I will be personally ... much more comfortable when we get that well below 2 percent, and I'll leave it at that," Fisher, speaking at an event here, said when asked if 2 percent was the maximum rate of inflation with which the U.S. central bank was comfortable. Inflation may be ebbing from elevated levels, but the Federal Reserve is monitoring price trends closely, he said. "There is hope that we may be turning the corner on inflation, but that needs to be confirmed and we are still vigilant," said Fisher, who is not a voting member of the U.S. central bank's policy-setting committee this year. The Fed kept its target for benchmark interest rates steady at 5.25 percent at its most recent meeting January 30-31, but renewed a warning on inflation, although it said the price picture seemed to be improving. Recent economic reports have shown that consumer prices climbed more sharply than expected while home construction fell sharply in January. Other Fed officials this week have made clear that they consider a flare-up in inflation a greater potential risk than an economic slowdown. Fisher said he sees some price pressures building as a result of skilled labor shortages. But he also said housing costs might be helping to ease some of upward push on prices. "Overall, I think that there might be a moderation in inflation pressures," he told reporters after the speech. But he also made plain that he remained wary. Asked by reporters about the Fed's warning on inflation risks in the minutes of its January 30-31 meeting released earlier this week, Fisher spelled out where he saw the danger in terms of growth or inflation. "Clearly, if I were to be asked which I had more concern about, it would that there are still risks to the upside. In the distribution curve, there is a tail that is a little bit fatter in terms of risks to the upside on inflation," he said. However, Fisher reiterated his optimism that price pressures would abate over the course of this year, while growth would come in around 3 percent of gross domestic product. "If we conduct the right policy, I believe we can bring inflation, have inflation this year at or below 2 percent." He also said that the slowdown in the housing market was not likely to tilt the economy into recession, and while it was a drag, strength from consumer spending was providing support. "I think that (housing) needs to be continued to be monitored, in terms of the effect of equity withdrawals on consumption behavior, but the consumer has been pretty solid and we saw that over the holiday season," Fisher said. "I think the underlying economic dynamics here are pretty good...right now I think we're in pretty good shape," he added.
