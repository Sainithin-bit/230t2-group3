 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - At least four private equity groups have been in preliminary talks with DaimlerChrysler AG DCXGn.DE about buying Chrysler, the Financial Times reported on Friday on its website. 


 Apollo Management LP, the Blackstone Group, the Carlyle Group, and Cerberus Capital Management LP, as well as several European firms, were contacted about their potential interest in buying the company's loss-making U.S. arm, the paper said, citing people familiar with the matter. The buyout firms were contacted before last week's announcement by DaimlerChrysler that "all options are on the table" for the unit, the paper said, adding that the discussions continued after the announcement. In New York Apollo, Blackstone, Carlyle and Cerberus could not immediately be reached.
