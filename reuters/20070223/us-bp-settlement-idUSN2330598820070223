 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oil giant BP Plc ( BP.L ) said on Friday it settled two more civil lawsuits linked to the 2005 blast at its Texas City, Texas, refinery that killed 15 people. 


 Terms of the settlement between the company and the two contractors who were among the 170 people injured in the explosion were confidential. The deals were "consistent with our long-stated desire to settle these cases," BP spokesman Scott Dean said. BP said settlements would be paid from the $1.6 billion the company has set aside to cover its liability from the explosion. A civil trial in the cases filed by E.J. Godeaux and Clarence Kinard had been scheduled to begin next week in Texas state court. BP had previously settled several lawsuits related to the explosion, which was one of several incidents that called into question its safety practices. Another 500 or so claims remain pending before a Texas judge, according to a plaintiffs' lawyer. An advisory panel headed by former U.S. Secretary of State James Baker said last month it found dangerous conditions at all five of BP's U.S. refineries and recommended the company overhaul its safety procedures. A deposition of BP Chief Executive John Browne by plaintiffs lawyers that had been scheduled to take place on Friday was delayed on Thursday. The Texas Supreme Court is expected to rule later on whether Browne should be required to be deposed in the case.
