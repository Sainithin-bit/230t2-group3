 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Major automakers believe stricter fuel economy standards for passenger cars are inevitable, but they want the Transportation Department -- not Congress -- to set the goal, the industry's lead U.S. trade group said on Friday. 


 "There will be an increase in fuel standards, but it needs to be through a process that relies on data in a balanced system," Dave McCurdy, president of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, told Reuters in an interview. The alliance represents General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ), Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ), DaimlerChrysler AG DCXGn.DE, Toyota Motor Corp. ( 7203.T ) and smaller companies. It is not recommending a fuel savings target and believes proposals for change must be carefully weighed. The Bush administration has submitted draft legislation ahead of a hearing next week by the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The Transportation Department's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is seeking authority to increase mileage standards for passenger cars based on size, rather than the current formula of averaging the performance of an automaker's fleet. The NHTSA proposal did not set a target for raising passenger car fuel economy, which is now required to average 27.5 miles per gallon. Last year, NHTSA increased fuel standards for light trucks, including sport utility vehicles, pick-ups and mini-vans, incrementally to 24.1 mpg by 2011 using the weight-based formula. "We believe that the one agency that has been authorized by Congress to develop those standards is NHTSA and they do a good job because they collect and analyze a large amount of data," McCurdy said. "We think there can be reform of the passenger car rule and we think the model that has been tested recently on light trucks is a good model." Some in Congress want sharp, across-the-board increases in fuel standards, an approach McCurdy criticized.
