 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - KB Home, the No. 5 U.S. home builder, said on Friday the Justice Department was looking into past stock options practices at KB, but added the agency said KB was not a target of the investigation. 


 "KB Home has and intends to fully cooperate with any government agency looking into this matter," the company said in a statement. Separately, Mark Beck, an attorney for former KB Home human resources chief Gary Ray, said in a telephone interview that prosecutors had asked to speak with Ray and other former executives as part of a stock options probe. Beck said his client has done nothing wrong. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission started looking into the company's stock options practices last August. Last November, following an internal investigation by KB Home into its stock options practices, Chairman and Chief Executive Bruce Karatz abruptly retired, Ray was fired and Richard Hirst, the company's chief legal officer, resigned. At that time, KB Home said that based on an internal investigation into stock options backdating, its "board of directors concluded that Mr. Karatz and Mr. Ray selected grant dates under the company's stock option plans." Backdating of options allows the holder to reap a greater profit when the option is exchanged. KB has said the practice occurred from 1998 to 2005.
