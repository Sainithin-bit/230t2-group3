 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Chrysler Group plans to cut 1,000 salaried jobs by the end of June, the first action under a previously announced turnaround plan that targets a total of 13,000 job cuts, the automaker said on Friday. 


 In a statement, Chrysler said eligible white-collar workers would be offered buyouts and early retirement packages in May and June. The buyouts will be offered to workers over age 53 with 10 years or more of seniority and effective as of June 30. The early retirement packages will be available to salaried workers over age 62 and effective as of end May, the automaker said. Younger workers and those with less seniority are not eligible for the buyout offers. Chrysler, which is targeting a return to profitability in 2008, is aiming to cut its salaried work force by 2,000 jobs by 2008. Its total planned job cuts, including 9,000 factory jobs in the United States and 2,000 blue-collar jobs in Canada, represents about 16 percent of the automaker's work force. The automaker, the fourth largest in terms of U.S. sales in 2006, had 16,800 white-collar workers and 82,500 total employees as of the end of the fourth quarter, said Chrysler Group spokesman Mike Aberlich. Chrysler said it remained in talks with the United Auto Workers on the terms of buyout offers for unionized workers. Of its unionized workers, about 4,700 Chrysler employees work outside factories in more traditional white collar areas like engineering and design. Those workers will have their buyout packages detailed next week, Aberlich said. Most of Chrysler's U.S. salaried employees work in its Auburn Hills, Michigan headquarters and the company's other facilities in the state. On a combined basis, the Detroit-based automakers have announced plans to cut over 80,000 factory jobs over the past year. That restructuring has hit the auto-reliant economy of Michigan especially hard. The state's unemployment rate 7.1 percent in December was the second highest in the United States, behind Mississippi.
