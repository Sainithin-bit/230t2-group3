 DETROIT  (Reuters) - A detailed sales prospectus for Chrysler Group bidders should be completed soon, according to two sources close to the process, the first step toward a potential sale that would unwind the 1998 merger that created DaimlerChrysler AG DCXGn.DE. 


 Private equity firms are expected to be among the potential bidders for Chrysler that would consider the automaker's sale-related documents, the sources said. Such information on Chrysler would be offered selectively to potential buyers -- with German parent DaimlerChrysler DCX.N avoiding an outright auction in favor of a more flexible sale process and leaving open the prospect that no bid might be strong enough to complete a deal, both sources said. "The process is going to take some time, but things are about to start," said a private equity investor who has been in contact with Chrysler. Chrysler and its investment bank J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. plan to offer detailed financial information on a selective basis to interested bidders, according to the investor and a second source connected with the process. "It's a way of controlling the process and it's a way for Daimler to say that this is not a distressed asset," said the investor of the planned Chrysler sales process. DaimlerChrysler had no comment. Its shares rose on the New York Stock Exchange, touching an intraday high of $71.10. Late in the session they were trading at $70.93, up 95 cents or 1.4 percent. The question of how quickly a deal to sell or spin off Chrysler would proceed has been considered closely by investors, analysts and employees of the struggling automaker since last week. At that time, DaimlerChrysler Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche surprised investors and analysts by saying all options were on the table for Chrysler, which represents the Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep brands. Chrysler Group Chief Executive Tom LaSorda told employees this week it might take months before questions about a possible sale of Chrysler could be answered. Some analysts have suggested that Chrysler could gain leverage in upcoming contract negotiations with its major union if a sale process remained underway through the summer. The current four-year contract between the United Auto Workers and Detroit-based automakers expires on September 14. Talks on a new contract are expected to focus on calls by the downtrodden industry for concessions. General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ), which has been hurting itself, has held preliminary talks with DaimlerChrysler about an outright acquisition of Chrysler or some kind of alliance with the automaker, sources have said. Other automakers -- including Germany's Volkswagen AG ( VOWG.DE ), Italy's Fiat SpA ( FIA.MI ), affiliates Renault SA ( RENA.PA ) of France and Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. ( 7201.T ) of Japan and South Korea's Hyundai Motor Co. Ltd. ( 005380.KS ), have said they are not interested in buying Chrysler. The automaker could attract bids from buyout groups. The Financial Times reported on Friday that at least four private equity groups have been in preliminary talks with DaimlerChrysler about buying Chrysler. Citing people familiar with the matter, the paper reported that Apollo Management LP, Blackstone Group, Carlyle Group and Cerberus Capital Management LP -- as well as several European firms -- were contacted about their potential interest in acquiring Chrysler before last week's announcement. The newspaper said those discussions continued after the Zetsche's announcement. Carlyle, Apollo and Cerberus declined comment. Blackstone was not immediately available for comment. Chrysler lost $1.48 billion last year and is cutting 13,000 jobs and closing an assembly plant in Delaware as part of a plan to return to profitability by 2008. UAW President Ron Gettelfinger, who holds a seat on Chrysler's supervisory board, said earlier this week that it was possible that Daimler would opt at the end of the day to keep Chrysler. "It may end up that it's not sold. Who knows?" he said in an interview with a Detroit radio station.
