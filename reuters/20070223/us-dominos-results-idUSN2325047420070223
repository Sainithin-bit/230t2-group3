 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Domino's Pizza Inc. ( DPZ.N ) reported lower fourth-quarter earnings on Friday as the pizza delivery chain's marketing and promotions failed to take off, but it managed to edge past analysts' expectations. 


 Higher costs led several store operators to adopt cost-cutting measures, hurting sales and leaving the company unprepared to meet income expectations, Chief Executive David Brandon said in a statement. "When we moved into the second half of the year, our stores were not well-positioned with the staffing and energy required to effectively execute against our stronger second-half marketing calendar," Brandon said. Sales at U.S. stores open at least a year, or same-store sales, fell 4.4 percent in the fourth quarter. Net income was $31 million, or 49 cents per share, a penny above analysts' average forecast as compiled by Reuters Estimates. In the year-earlier quarter the company earned $40.2 million, or 59 cents per share. Revenue fell 4.8 percent to $435.3 million. The company said the latest results were not comparable to the year-ago period due to the financial impact of the sale of its French and Dutch operations during 2006. International revenue fell almost 15 percent in the quarter due to the sale, it said. Domestic sales are expected to grow by 1 percent to 3 percent annually, and international sales by 3 percent to 5 percent, the company said. It did not provide specific earnings guidance. Earlier this month, Domino's unveiled a recapitalization plan that called for converting to securitized financing from traditional bank and bond financing. It set equity and debt tender offers to move ahead with the plan. Domino's shares were down 76 cents, or 2.35 percent, at $31.54 in early trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
