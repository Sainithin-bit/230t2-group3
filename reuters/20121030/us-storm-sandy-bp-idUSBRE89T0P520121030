 LONDON  (Reuters) - Fuel supplies to the U.S. North East should recovery fast in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, according to the chief executive of BP Plc ( BP.L ), which has no refineries in the affected region but which operates supply infrastructure there. 
 "It has disrupted logistics, but there is an efficient infrastructure ... It will bounce back quickly... I don't think it (disruption) will be long-lasting," CEO Bob Dudley told reporters on a conference call. (Reporting by  Andrew Callus ; editing by Jane Baird)
