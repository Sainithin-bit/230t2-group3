 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. equities exchanges, which have been shut down since Monday due to a massive storm that ravaged the East Coast, were discussing plans early Tuesday to open markets the following day, said a source at one of the exchanges. 
 "Our intention remains to open for business," on Wednesday, said a source at another exchange. (Reporting By  John McCrank ; Editing by  David Gregorio )
