 GREENSBORO, North Carolina  (Reuters) - The White House said on Tuesday that it was sticking with its position that ailing automakers must prove their viability before receiving government aid, as the industry's top three companies presented plans to Congress. 

 "We are sticking to our guns that the companies have to prove that they are viable before the taxpayer dollars should be given to them," White House spokeswoman Dana Perino told reporters traveling with President George W. Bush to North Carolina. "I realize that they say they are teetering on the edge of bankruptcy," she said. "We've said that we wanted to support them, and we've provided what we believe is a bipartisan way to do that." (Reporting by  Matt Spetalnick ; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
