 DETROIT  (Reuters) - The leadership of the United Auto Workers plans to brief members on the economics of the embattled Detroit automakers on Wednesday, a day after the companies are set to submit restructuring plans to U.S. lawmakers. 

 Executives from General Motors Corp, Chrysler and Ford Motor Co are appearing before Congress this week to win support for a $25 billion rescue package amid a downturn in global sales. UAW President Ron Gettelfinger said on Detroit radio station WWJ on Tuesday, "We're going to use it as an opportunity to bring our membership and fellowmen up on where we are at and especially bring them up to speed on the economics within the various companies." Gettelfinger declined to comment on whether the UAW would reopen the 2007 contracts with GM, Ford and Chrysler. That contract, hailed as a breakthrough when it was ratified a year ago, allows the automakers to hire new workers at wages as low as $14 per hour and shift retiree health care costs to a trust fund aligned with the union from 2010. But analysts expect the UAW to make new concessions to the Detroit automakers that would eliminate job security for workers at plants that are closed and could change the terms of payments pledged for the retiree health care trust. UAW officials are expected to discuss what concessions the union is prepared to make at Wednesday's meeting, a person with knowledge of the agenda said on Tuesday.
