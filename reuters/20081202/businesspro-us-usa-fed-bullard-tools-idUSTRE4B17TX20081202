 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve has ample tools to use to stimulate the economy even with interest rates nearing zero, the head of the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank said on Tuesday. 

 "I think the Fed has plenty of tools that we can use," James Bullard said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. "One of the main things that I'm concerned about is somehow we can communicate what we're going to do to a private sector that's used to thinking in terms of interest rates, because for the time being it looks like that's going to be off the table for awhile."
