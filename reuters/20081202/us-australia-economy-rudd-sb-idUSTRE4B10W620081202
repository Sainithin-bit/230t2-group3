 CANBERRA  (Reuters) - Australia is concerned its revised economic forecasts for slower growth and rising unemployment are at risk due to the deepening global slowdown, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said on Tuesday. 

 "We are concerned that the global economic recession will further impact negatively on Australia's projections in both these areas," Rudd told the Australian parliament. The government on November 5 forecast the economy to grow by 2.0 percent in 2008/09, down from its May budget forecast of 2.75 percent, with unemployment to rise to 5.0 percent by the June quarter 2009, from the current 4.3 percent.
