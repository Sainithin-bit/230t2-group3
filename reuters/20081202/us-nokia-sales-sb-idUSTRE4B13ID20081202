 BARCELONA  (Reuters) - Nokia Oyj, the world's largest mobile phone maker, said on Tuesday it does not expect the economic downturn to have much impact on sales of its upcoming flagship N97 model. 

 "Our target group, 200 to 300 million technology leaders, in all times buy devices they are interested in," Nokia's head of sales Anssi Vanjoki told reporters, adding he also expects to see operators subsidize phones. "Operators have to compete for these clients, regardless of (the market)," he said. Vanjoki said Nokia had no reason to enter the market for netbooks, or small laptops, something some analysts have expected. "Our aim is to make mobile devices for the next generation, beyond netbooks," Vanjoki said. He said the company aims to keep its dominating position in emerging markets, despite pressure from new rivals. "Many people have tried over the years, but (rivals) have always changed. We are the only one who has kept their position, and so we aim to do also in the future," he said. Vanjoki also said he had no interest to become chief executive of Finnish sporting goods group Amer Sports, something widely speculated in the Finnish media. (Reporting by  Tarmo Virki )
