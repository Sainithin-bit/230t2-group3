 BERLIN  (Reuters) - Germany is ready for further talks with General Motors on the sale of European carmaker Opel and wants to avoid confrontation with the U.S. firm on the matter, a government spokesman said on Monday. 

 "It is important not to resort to confrontation," government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm said at a regular government news conference, adding the government aimed to invite a member of the GM board to Germany to discuss Opel this week. On Friday, GM failed to recommend either of two bidders for Opel -- Canadian supplier Magna, Germany's preferred buyer, or rival bidder RHJ International.
