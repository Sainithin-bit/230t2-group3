 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - News Corp's ( NWSA.O ) Dow Jones & Co Inc is only in the early stages of exploring a sale of its stock market index business and a sales prospectus has not gone out yet, a source familiar with the matter said. 

 Goldman Sachs has been hired as a financial advisor to explore the options for the business, which includes the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI , according the source, who declined to identified because the process is private. A Dow Jones spokesman could not be reached immediately for comment. Rupert Murdoch's News Corp bought Dow Jones in 2007 for $5.7 billion, but since then he has come under criticism for paying such a hefty price for a publishing company whose businesses have suffered from the sharp drop in ad sales. Earlier this year, News Corp wrote down $2.8 billion in Dow Jones' value. The move to explore options for the business is not surprising. Industry analysts never felt it was much favored by Murdoch, a passionate backer of newspapers and one of the best-known media moguls. Indeed, a number of analysts expected him to consider a sale of the index business soon after striking the deal for Dow Jones. Potential buyers for the business could include McGraw-Hill Cos MHP.N Standard & Poor's, Russell Indexes, MSCI Inc MXB.N, Bloomberg, Pearson Plc's ( PSON.L ) Financial Times and Thomson Reuters Corp TRIN.O ( TRI.TO ) Tril.L. ( TRI.N ). On Friday, all of those companies declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the news, said the process could result in an arrangement other than a sale, like a joint venture.
