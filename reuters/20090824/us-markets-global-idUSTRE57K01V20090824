 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Crude oil extended gains on Monday but a rally in world equity markets sputtered in the United States after investors questioned whether stock prices had outpaced the potential strength of economic recovery. 

 Oil prices briefly touched a 10-month high near $75 a barrel after reports showed that new industrial orders in the euro zone rebounded in June and U.S. economic activity improved again in July.. The dollar edged up against the euro and yen in extremely thin trade as Wall Street surrendered earlier gains and traders repositioned themselves ahead of key U.S. consumer and housing data due later in the week. The early rally in U.S. stocks faded about midday after U.S. Treasuries rose as investors swooped in to take advantage of sharp losses in government debt markets on Friday. "We have been recently seeing a disconnect between the two markets. Stocks were up on economic optimism and bonds were up on economic concerns," said Peter Boockvar, equity strategist at Miller Tabak & Co in New York. "Investors are finally catching up with this, and seeing Treasuries as a sign that they should not be buying so much," Boockvar said. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  closed up 3.32 points, or 0.03 percent, at 9,509.28. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  slipped 0.56 point, or 0.05 percent, at 1,025.57. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  fell 2.92 points, or 0.14 percent, at 2,017.98. RISE IN MIDWEST MANUFACTURING Economic data was cheered by some investors, but others saw reasons for caution. A rise in the Chicago Federal Reserve Bank's Midwest manufacturing index was led by a surge in auto output after the White House's "cash for clunkers" program. In addition, Nouriel Roubini, one of the few economists who predicted the magnitude of the world financial crisis, said in an Financial Times article a recovery is likely to be anemic and there is a "big risk" of a double-dip recession. The lock-step in which commodity prices have tracked equity markets higher in recent months is an anomaly and could come under pressure, said Troy Buckner, managing principal of hedge fund NuWave Investment Management in Morristown, New Jersey. "It's been an extreme correlation between equity market movements and commodities, especially copper, aluminum and crude oil," he said. "Prices have moved too far too fast." NuWave has bet crude and heating oil prices will fall, while it has reduced long positions in copper and aluminum. U.S. crude rose 48 cents to settle at $74.37 a barrel after peaking at $74.81, the highest intraday price since October 21. Brent crude gained 7 cents to $74.26. The gains followed the early rise on Wall Street. "The stock market's rise is driving crude oil futures higher, with the outlook controlled by economic optimism," said Phil Flynn, analyst at PFGBest Research in Chicago. U.S. gold futures fell, losing more than 1 percent in thin volume. U.S. December gold futures settled down $11 at 943.70 an ounce in New York. The dollar strengthened against a basket of currencies, putting downward pressure on gold by making dollar-priced commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies. The dollar was last up 0.1 percent at 94.49 yen, while the euro slipped 0.2 percent to $1.4293. European shares hit their highest closing level in nearly 10 months, boosted by banks and miners. The FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of top European shares ended 0.9 percent up at 975.19 points, the highest closing level since early November. Banks were among top gainers, with DJ STOXX banking index .SX7P rising 1.8 percent. Japan's Nikkei average  .N225  jumped 3.4 percent, boosted by hopes for a global recovery and lifted by camera maker Canon Inc ( 7751.T ) and other exporters.
