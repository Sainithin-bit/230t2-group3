 BEIJING  (Reuters) - European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said in Beijing on Friday that he thinks China had "clearly understood" the message on currencies. 

 Speaking to reporters after a meeting with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, Barosso added that there needs to be "predictable" ties between major currencies. He also said the Group of 20 industrialized and developing nations should discuss issues of "monetary stability," including the level of China's yuan.
