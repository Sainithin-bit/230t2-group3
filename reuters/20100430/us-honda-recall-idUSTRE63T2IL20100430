 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co Ltd ( 7267.T ) said it would recall 167,255 Acura TSX sedans sold in the U.S. market to address the risk that power steering fluid could leak and cause an under-the-hood fire. 

 The recall, covering 2004-2008 model year Acura TSX vehicles with 2.4-liter inline four-cylinder engines, comes after one fire was reported due to leaking fluid. Honda and U.S. safety regulators said that over time power steering hoses may crack and leak. U.S. safety regulators in a statement issued Friday morning said power steering fluid "leaking onto a hot exhaust pipe will generate smoke and a burning smell, and could potentially result in an under hood fire." Honda will notify U.S. Acura TSX owners and its dealers will repair the Acuras for free, beginning on May 28, said the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in a report. The repair, Honda said, involves installation of a new power steering hose, O-ring gasket and fluid. Honda officials in Canada said that cars in Canada were not subject to the recall.
