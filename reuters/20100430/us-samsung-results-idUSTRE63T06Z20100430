 SEOUL  (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co Ltd ( 005930.KS ), the world's top maker of memory chips and flat screen TVs, forecast record results as it aims to sharply boost spending, betting on still strong demand in the second half. 

 Samsung is firing on all cylinders as consumers snap up gadgets and appliances, marking a steep recovery in the once-battered global technology sector, but rising industry investments threaten to restart the chronic oversupply cycle. Samsung, also the world's No.2 handset maker behind Finland's Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ), has little traction in the lucrative smartphone markets, which could also be an earnings drag for Asia's most valuable technology firm. "I expect earnings to peak at Q3 as seasonal demand for memory chips reaches its highest...there is a gloomy air in its telecommunication segment since it has lost ground on smartphones," said Kim Young-june, an analyst at LIG Investment & Securities. By 0320 GMT, shares in Samsung, valued at around $107 billion, rose 2.1 percent in a strong broader market  .KS11 . The shares have slipped 4 percent after hitting a record high in early April on growing worries of oversupply in LCD and chips. "We are cautiously optimistic Q2 earnings will improve... As for H2, we are again cautiously optimistic because we expect strong demand for memory chips and LCD to continue, helped by seasonality, as well as continued increase in sales of handsets and TVs," Robert Yi, Samsung's vice president of investor relations, told analysts. Samsung competes with Sony Corp ( 6758.T ) and LG Electronics ( 066570.KS ) in flat-screen TVs and Toshiba ( 6502.T ) and Hynix ( 000660.KS ) in semiconductors. Samsung reported a 4.4 trillion won ($3.95 billion) operating profit in January-March, beating a consensus forecast for a 4.27 trillion won profit by 13 analysts from Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Chips accounted for 44 percent of the company's profit in the first quarter, while telecoms generated a quarter and the rest was almost evenly split between LCD and appliances. OVERSUPPLY CONCERNS Samsung declined to give details on its much-awaited update on 2010 capital spending plans but said it would "substantially increase" investment this year from its previous outlook of 8.5 trillion won. The spending plan underscores an aggressive push toward new technology by Lee Kun-hee, who returned as Samsung chairman last month and has orchestrated its successful foray into the chip business since the early 1980s. Lee, 68, has repeatedly warned most businesses and products that represent Samsung today would disappear from the market in 10 years and the company needed to start again. A local paper reported on Friday that Samsung was planning a record 19.3 trillion won spending in semiconductors until 2011 and has started placing equipment orders, as it fails to meet soaring customer demand. Samsung's earnings were better than it's median estimate of 4.3 trillion won in a range of 4.1 trillion to 4.5 trillion won given earlier this month. This marked a more than seven fold rise from a year ago and 28 percent from the previous quarter. Samsung sold 64.3 million mobile phones in the first quarter, up 40 percent from a year ago, and expects higher sales and double-digit margins in the second quarter, driven by higher-margin smartphones.
