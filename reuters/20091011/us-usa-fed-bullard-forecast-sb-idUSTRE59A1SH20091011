 ST. LOUIS  (Reuters) - The U.S. economy is growing again and can probably generate somewhere around 2.5 percent to 3 percent growth in 2010, a Federal Reserve official said on Sunday. 

 St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said it was "reasonable" to expect growth in that range, although the economy could expand even faster in the first part of the year. Still, he described the labor market as "upsetting" and said it would probably remain weak for a while. (Reporting by  Emily Kaiser ; Editing by  Diane Craft )
