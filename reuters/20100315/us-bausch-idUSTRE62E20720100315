 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Two former top executives of drugmaker Schering-Plough Corp were named on Monday as new leaders of privately owned eye-care company Bausch & Lomb. 

 Former Schering-Plough Chief Executive Officer Fred Hassan will be chairman of Bausch's board, while Brent Saunders, who previously served as president of Schering-Plough's consumer healthcare unit under Hassan, will be Bausch's CEO. Both appointments are effective immediately, said Bausch, which is majority-owned by Warburg Pincus. Bausch's Chairman and CEO Gerald Ostrov is retiring and will serve as a consultant to the new leaders. One of the drug industry's most prominent executives, Hassan left Schering after its acquisition by Merck & Co ( MRK.N ) last year. He has served as senior adviser to Warburg Pincus since November.
