 CANBERRA  (Reuters) - Negotiations for a free trade deal drawing together the United States and seven other Pacific countries began in Australia on Monday. 

 The Trans Pacific Partnership, or TPP, is billed as a "new generation" regional deal that could free up access to crucial export markets for the world's largest economy, while breathing new life into frozen world trade talks. Here are some questions and answers about the TPP: WHAT IS THE TPP? The TPP idea stems from a 2001 trade deal between Singapore and New Zealand, but current "scoping" talks involve eight nations, the United States, Australia, Chile, Brunei, New Zealand, Singapore, Vietnam and Peru. Canada and Malaysia could also be future members, while more ambitious hopes rest also on bringing in China, Japan and South Korea. The eight immediate nations have a combined GDP of $16.2 trillion and are home to 470 million people. Talks in Melbourne will cover tariffs and non-tariff trade barriers, e-commerce, services and intellectual property. At least three more negotiations will take place this year, with Vietnam initially an observer. Australia's Trade Minister Simon Crean has described it as "an ambitious, 21st-century agreement" that will build economic integration in the region. It could also help reinvigorate the stalled Doha round of world trade talks. WHY IS THE U.S. SUPPORTIVE? President Barack Obama, who has described himself as the first "Pacific President," identified the TPP last year as a top trade priority and will discuss it during an upcoming Australia visit. The United States sees an eventual deal as moving beyond free trade and underpinning a broader regional economic integration A successful outcome could help lever open more access to Asia for U.S. exports and ease double-digit unemployment in the wake of the global financial crisis. The United States, like European nations, has found it difficult until now to lock into trade deals with Asian counterparts. Obama's administration aims to double exports over the next 5 years and create 2 million new jobs by deepening U.S. engagement with major emerging markets such as China, India, Brazil and the Asia-Pacific region. U.S. Deputy Trade Representative Demetrios Marantis last month said it was Washington's aim "to advance our mutual economic interests with the fastest growing economies in the world." WHY SOME SECTORS ARE OPPOSED? American beef and dairy farmers are worried about the prospect of free-trading competition, particularly from dairy farming giants such as New Zealand. New Zealand firm Fonterra has been described as the "Saudi Arabia of milk," and would have much more access to the lucrative U.S. market under a successful TPP. The U.S. National Milk Producers Federation estimated that competition from New Zealand would see American dairy producers lose $20 billion in revenue over 10 years. U.S. beef producers are also calling for a deal to be rejected, worried about competition from New Zealand and Australia. U.S. cattlemen say 20 years of increasing overseas access have led to lower prices for cattle producers, while benefits have flowed to U.S. meat packers and retailers. Unions across the Pacific are calling for any agreement to protect workers, worrying that a freeing of investment rules could make it more difficult to regulate public services and the financial sector. U.S. lawmakers last week also stressed that any deal must recognize the importance of democratic values, worker rights and food safety. (Reporting by  Rob Taylor ; Editing by  Alex Richardson )
