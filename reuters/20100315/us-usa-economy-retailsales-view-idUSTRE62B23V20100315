 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Sales at U.S. retailers rose unexpectedly in February despite a drop in vehicle purchases and inclement weather that was expected to curtail shopping, according to a government report on Friday that bolstered hopes of a sustainable economic recovery. 

 KEY POINTS: * The Commerce Department said total retail sales rose 0.3 percent as consumers bought an array of goods from necessities to luxury items. Sales for January were, however, revised down to only a gain of 0.1 percent from the previously reported 0.5 percent rise. * Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales slipping 0.2 percent last month. Compared to February last year, sales were 3.9 percent higher. * Motor vehicle and parts purchases fell 2 percent last month, likely reflecting vehicle recalls by Toyota Motor Corp, that have held back auto sales. They fell 1.5 percent in January. COMMENTS: FRANK LESH, FUTURES ANALYST AND BROKER, FUTUREPATH TRADING LLC, CHICAGO: "The numbers support this move up. We've got a lot of concern about the consumer and going forward that is a surprise when they do better than expected. But yeah, it's good news. I'm not sure what the correlation is between this and UMich, so we'll have to see. So as long as UMich is unchanged or better that will keep the rally intact as well." CAMILLA SUTTON, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST, SCOTIA CAPITAL, TORONTO: "Everything is really turning in favor of dollar-yen: stronger U.S. data as well as comments from the Japanese government and central bank saying there are limits to how much yen strength they can take. As for the data on retail sales, I think it keeps hinting that the U.S. recovery is intact and ongoing. There's been a lot of worry about how the economy will transition from government spending to consumer spending and we're starting to see some evidence of that. It's good news."
