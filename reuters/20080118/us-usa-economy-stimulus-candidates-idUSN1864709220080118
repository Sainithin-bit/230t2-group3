 (Reuters) - President George W. Bush announced a $150 billion plan on Friday to help stimulate the ailing economy. 

 Here are reactions from some of the main candidates in the U.S. presidential race: DEMOCRATS SEN. HILLARY CLINTON "Unfortunately, the Bush plan shortchanges the 50 million Americans who most need an economic shot in the arm." "For the White House to propose spending over $100 billion to jump-start the economy, while shortchanging assistance to the 50 million families who are struggling the most and are most likely to inject those funds into the economy makes no sense." "The Bush approach would fail to fully help the millions of lower income senior citizens who live on fixed incomes and are under enormous financial stress. And it would disproportionately leave out African-American and Hispanic families who have, on average, lower incomes than white families." FORMER SEN. JOHN EDWARDS "Now that George Bush has finally joined the call for an economic stimulus package, the time for debate and delay is over. American families cannot wait any longer for swift and decisive action. After years of stagnant wages, the economy may be slipping into a recession and if we don't act now we may make our problems worse." "The economic damage done by Bush and Cheney is deep and long-lasting, and the temporary tax cuts he proposes will not solve it alone. Making matters worse, his plan provides little or no help to some 50 million low-income and middle class families." SEN. BARACK OBAMA "After months and months of watching families struggle to get by in this economy, George Bush finally offered a plan that would leave out tens of millions of working Americans and seniors who need help most and are most likely to spend and boost our economy. That's why when I announced my economic stimulus package last week, I called for immediate tax relief for working families and seniors who shouldn't have to wait for help any longer." REPUBLICANS FORMER MAYOR RUDY GIULIANI "President Bush's stimulus package is a positive step toward re-energizing the American economy. In times like this it is important to ease the burden on American families by creating an environment where businesses can thrive and jobs can grow." "It's the reason why my tax plan to strengthen the economy is the largest tax cut in American history, saving families thousands of dollars a year. I will extend the current tax rates immediately and go even further - calling for lower rates, while also dramatically simplifying the tax code. It's the pro-growth plan that can get our country moving again." SEN. JOHN MCCAIN "I have to see it. I can't tell you whether I'd vote for something I haven't even seen. I cannot tell you how I would vote for it until I have seen it. But we've got to stop the out-of-control spending, which is the cause of the problems that we have." "I want to see where that money is going to come from." FORMER GOV. MITT ROMNEY "Today, the President took an important step forward to jump-starting our economy by laying out his principles for an economic stimulus package. We must immediately cut taxes on both individuals and businesses, and address the housing crisis to help American homeowners. Permanent reductions in both individual and corporate tax rates are vital to strengthening the economy in the long term." "It is critical for every American that Washington quickly debate, pass and sign into law a pro-growth stimulus package."
