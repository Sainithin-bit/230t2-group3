 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - World stocks fell further on Friday, leading bond yields mostly lower, after an economic stimulus package announced by President George W. Bush left investors somewhat disappointed. 

 Bush called for a package of tax cuts and other measures totaling around 1.0 percent of U.S. gross domestic product, or up to $150 billion, after weak recent reports on employment, retail sales, factory activity, and housing construction this month suggested the United States -- the world's largest economy --may be heading into recession. Under consideration in the package announced by Bush are ideas like tax rebates, incentives for businesses, and extensions of unemployment insurance. "The fear is that the plan and even the Fed may not have enough firepower to turn the path to recession around," said Richard Sparks, senior equities analyst at Schaeffer's Investment Research in Cincinnati. Earlier this week Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke again pledged that the U.S. central bank was ready to act to prop up economic growth, reinforcing expectations for interest rates cuts at the Fed's next policy meeting on January 29-30. In the United States, the benchmark S&P 500 stock index on Friday ended its worst week in 5-1/2 years. Financial and telecommunications companies, including insurer American International Group ( AIG.N ) and Sprint Nextel Corp ( S.N ), were among the top decliners on the S&P 500. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was down 59.91 points, or 0.49 percent, at 12,099.30. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was down 8.06 points, or 0.60 percent, at 1,325.19. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was down 6.88 points, or 0.29 percent, at 2,340.02. U.S. markets are closed on Monday for the Martin Luther King Day holiday. European stocks also ended lower, dropping for the 10th time in 13 sessions as banks and insurers tumbled on renewed worries over mortgage-related losses, while investors gave a cold initial reception to the U.S. economic stimulus package. The FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of top European shares ended down 1.2 percent at 1,358.51, capping a dismal week during which Europe's benchmark index lost 4.8 percent. The FTSEurofirst 300 index has lost nearly 9.0 percent since the beginning of 2008, as worries about the U.S. economy tipping into recession knocked equity markets worldwide. "The persisting pressure on the financials suggests the credit crisis harbors further risks for overall market," Tammo Greetfeld, equity strategist at HVB, wrote in a note. He cited risks that the banks may have to take "provisions for the credit risks emanating from a general deterioration in the credit portfolio because of a slowing economy." Earlier on Friday, Japan's Nikkei average  .N225  recovered from an early dive to end 0.6 percent higher at 13,861.29 points, lifted by expectations for the U.S. economic stimulus package. BOND YIELDS LOWER BUT U.S. DOLLAR STEADY Bond yields also fell as stocks lost more ground on investor fears the White House stimulus package might not keep the U.S. economy from sliding into recession. "It is probably going to be too little and too late," said Mary Ann Hurley, vice president of fixed-income trading at D.A. Davidson & Co. in Seattle. The U.S. two-year Treasury note yield fell to a three-year low around 2.35 percent, while European government bond yields fell for the fourth straight week, with the two year Schatz yield ending around 3.46 percent, and the Japanese two-year note yield slipped to 0.575 percent. The U.S. dollar was little changed though as investors weighed the likely impact of the Bush fiscal package. "The market is no longer viewing the U.S. economic slowdown in isolation. Although domestic demand-based emerging market growth will provide a counterbalance, a cyclical global moderation now appears more likely," UBS said in a note to clients. The euro ended the week around $1.4626, while against the U.S. dollar the yen was steady around 106.6 yen. Investors said the dollar's problems are not over yet with the longer-term outlook for the U.S. economy remaining bleak. U.S. crude oil prices edged up to above $90 a barrel after a three-day slide. On the New York Mercantile Exchange February crude was up 42 cents at $90.55 per barrel. Crude oil prices hit a record just over $100 a barrel on January 3 before slipping back on concerns about slowing demand due to the threat of a global economic slowdown. Gold also firmed slightly from a one-week low and ended around $883.90 an ounce, after seeing a record around $914 earlier this week. "External factors such as higher inflation expectations, broader economic concerns, geopolitical tensions and Fed rate easing are likely to drive prices higher," Barclays Capital said in a report.
