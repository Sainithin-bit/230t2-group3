 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and Continental Airlines have all raised their domestic fuel surcharges, matching a move by American Airlines amid soaring fuel prices. 

 American, a unit of AMR Corp AMR.N, on Thursday doubled its domestic fuel surcharge to $40 per round-trip fare, except in markets where it faces low-fare competition. Delta ( DAL.N ) and United, a unit of UAL Corp UAUA.O, both said on Friday they matched American's increase. Fare tracker FareCompare.com said Continental matched the increase and also levied different surcharges on many city pairs depending on the date of travel. FareCompare also said that United and Continental raised fuel surcharges on some round-trip fares to as high as $60. A fuel surcharge increase initiated by United last week was withdrawn after rival carriers failed to support the $50 fee. The airline industry hopes to combat soaring fuel costs by raising fares, but that strategy will be tested if the weakening U.S. economy saps travel demand. "The bottom line for air travelers is that deals are going to be harder to find in 2008," FareCompare CEO Rick Seaney said in an e-mail. "The only wildcards that may stop this freight train of increases in 2008 are a dip in fuel prices or softening in demand." (Reporting by  Chris Reiter ; Editing by  Richard Chang )
