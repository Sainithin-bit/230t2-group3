 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Stocks tumbled for a fourth day on Friday to close out the worst week for the S&P 500 in five years on worry that a White House effort to boost the economy may not prevent a recession. 

 The U.S. stock market is off to its worst start to a year on record. Financial firms absorbed the brunt of the selling, again, on worries over spreading subprime mortgage fallout, and were joined in the route by telecommunications companies after Sprint Nextel ( S.N ) announced big subscriber losses and thousands of layoffs. Sprint fell 25 percent on the day. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was down 55.36 points, or 0.46 percent, at 12,103.85. The Standard & Poor's 500 index  .SPX  was down 7.48 points, or 0.56 percent, at 1,325.77. The Nasdaq Composite index  .IXIC  was down 5.86 points, or 0.25 percent, at 2,341.04.
