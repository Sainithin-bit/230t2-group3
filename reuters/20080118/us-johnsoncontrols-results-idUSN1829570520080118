 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Johnson Controls Inc ( JCI.N ) said on Friday quarterly earnings jumped 45 percent, better than expected, on strength in its building controls and automotive interiors businesses. 

 The company also stood by its forecast for double-digit earnings and sales growth in the fiscal year begun in October, seen as a positive sign by analysts, and its shares rose 3 percent in pre-market trading. "We are encouraged at the reiteration of '08 guidance, despite the now weaker North American macro outlook," JP Morgan analyst Himanshu Patel said in a note to clients. Johnson Controls first issued its fiscal 2008 outlook in October, long before automakers and analysts began to trim expectations for North American industry vehicle sales and before wider concerns about a possible U.S. recession. The company said net income rose to $235 million, or 39 cents per share, in the fiscal first quarter ended December 31, from $162 million, or 27 cents per share, a year earlier. The results beat analysts' average forecast by 2 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue increased 15.5 percent to $9.48 billion, ahead of analysts' expectations of $9.14 billion. Johnson Controls, one of the biggest U.S. car-parts suppliers, greatly reduced its exposure to the volatile auto industry when it bought York International in 2005 to expand its building controls business. Fitch Ratings Managing Director Mark Oline said of the first-quarter results, "It really provides evidence that the company continues to demonstrate the benefits of the York acquisition and the solid growth platform that it provides going forward." Auto interiors and seating remains Johnson Controls' biggest business segment, with building controls second. The company also produces lead-acid batteries used to start cars, and invests in advanced battery technology for hybrid vehicles. First-quarter sales rose 8.7 percent to $4.59 billion for automotive parts, 11 percent to $3.24 billion for building controls, and 54.6 percent to $1.65 billion in the battery segment. In the automotive interiors business, revenue rose 14 percent in Europe and 5 percent in North America. Segment income more than doubled due to stronger parts pricing and benefits from a restructuring in North America. The company reported strong demand in the United States and internationally for building controls, where the backlog of uncompleted contracts was up 13 percent to $4.4 billion at the end of December. The controls business's focus on buildings in the education, health care and government sectors, as well as offices and service contracts, has provided some insulation from the U.S. residential real estate downturn. Demand for building efficiency equipment also rises as energy costs increase. Investments in hybrid technology pressured income for the batteries segment. A large part of the revenue increase was due to pass-throughs of higher lead costs to customers. The company forecast second-quarter earnings of 46 cents to 48 cents per share from continuing operations. Analysts average estimate is 46 cents. Johnson Controls said it still expects fiscal 2008 earnings of $2.45 to $2.50 per share from continuing operations, and sales growth of 10 percent to about $38 billion. Analysts are looking for $2.49 per share on revenue of $38.16 billion. Johnson Controls shares were at $34.80 in pre-market trade, up from $33.76 at Thursday's close on the New York Stock Exchange. Through Thursday, the stock was down 6.3 percent this year, while the Dow Jones U.S. automobiles and parts index .DJUSAP had fallen 11.6 percent.
