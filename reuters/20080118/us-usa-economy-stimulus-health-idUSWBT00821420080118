 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The economy is "relatively healthy" despite turmoil in the housing and financial markets, White House economic adviser Edward Lazear said on Friday. 

 In a news conference regarding the Bush Administration's call for a prompt economic stimulus plan, Lazear noted that the unemployment rate remained below the average of the past three decades. In December, the unemployment rate unexpectedly spiked to a two-year high of 5 percent, deepening investors' concerns about an imminent recession. (Reporting by  Emily Kaiser ; Editing by Tom Hals)
