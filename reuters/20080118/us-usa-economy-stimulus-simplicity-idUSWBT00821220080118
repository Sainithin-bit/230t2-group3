 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Bush administration and Congress should work together to quickly pass a fiscal stimulus package that boosts consumer spending and spurs business investment, U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said on Friday. 

 "We've looked at a lot of things. We believe that there's a great benefit to being simple. You know, the Christmas season has come and gone. We're not trying to decorate a Christmas tree here," Paulson told reporters at a White House briefing. (Editing by Tom Hals)
