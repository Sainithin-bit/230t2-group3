 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. President George W. Bush on Friday plans to call for an economic stimulus package equal to about 1.0 percent of U.S. gross domestic product, according to a White House document obtained by Reuters. 

 The document, which was circulated to lawmakers, also urges that the plan focus on tax cuts for individuals and businesses rather than expanding federal government spending.  COMMENTS:  IAN LYNGEN, INTEREST RATE STRATEGIST, RBS GREENWICH CAPITAL,  GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT: "It's $130 billion, which was in the range of what people were expecting. Both of which, the size and focus on tax cuts, are consistent with what I think the vast majority of the market was looking for, particularly in the context of what happened last time this became an issue. "They are announcing the principles of a stimulus package but it feels like there are details that are left to be decided. "Unless it is, 'We are going to do X, the market believes it's really impressive and it's a sure deal,' I think that there is going to be a little bit of reluctance to think that the problems facing the economy are behind us." "Maybe, maybe it's conceivable that whoever they decide should get some type of tax relief gets it maybe at the end of the second quarter or beginning of the third quarter. Maybe sometime in 2008. What's that going to do to this economy?"  OWEN FITZPATRICK, HEAD OF U.S. EQUITY GROUP, DEUTSCHE BANK  PRIVATE WEALTH MANAGEMENT, NEW YORK: "It all hits at once, and it's not something that's lasting. The (stock) market is looking for something that will have more of a lasting impact on the tax structure. The last time we had one of these, it did help the economy, but it would just be a one-time event. "The market is really looking for some action out of the Fed."  PETER KENNY, MANAGING DIRECTOR, KNIGHT EQUITY MARKETS, JERSEY  CITY, NEW JERSEY: "At first blush it appears the news is a little less dramatic than people were hoping for. Uncertainty is the primarily reason why the market has gone lower. The market is hoping for help both fiscally and monetarily that it can qualify as likely to have a real impact."  MARY ANN HURLEY, VICE PRESIDENT OF FIXED-INCOME TRADING, D.A.  DAVIDSON & CO., SEATTLE: "It's a really small amount as a percentage of GDP. Given the magnitude of the problems that are facing the economy I think it is probably going to be too little and too late."  CHRISTOPHER LOW, CHIEF ECONOMIST, FTN FINANCIAL, NEW YORK: "The economy is enormous and it needs a lot of stimulus. The proposed 1.0 percent of GDP package is all we can justify because it will put us in a big deficit as it is. It's not enough to solve all our problems."  MARK WAGGONER, PRESIDENT, EXCEL FUTURES, HUNTINGTON BEACH,  CALIFORNIA: "The markets are skeptical of this plan. People are looking for checks, money, which was what the government gave them in the 2001 recession. This Bush plan says relief will come in the form of tax cuts, which is not going to help those who need help most. People need immediate relief, they need money to help them right now, with the high price of gasoline and with their holiday bills coming in. They are also worrying about paying their taxes, which will come due very soon."  WILLIAM SULLIVAN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, JVB FINANCIAL GROUP, BOCA  RATON, FLORIDA: "Those headlines suggest to me that we're not going to have a quick agreement between the White House and Congress on a stimulus package and if that's the case, that's why the markets could be disappointed. "In order to have a bi-partisan stimulus package, the Democrats have said that Bush cannot make his expiring tax cuts permanent so if talk about broad tax cuts includes making those tax cuts permanent, it's a non-starter for bi-partison action and that's where the disappointment would lie. It gives the market the idea that there might be some delay in getting a stimulus package through Congress and signed into law."  SHAUN OSBORNE. CHIEF CURRENCY STRATEGIST, TD SECURITIES,  TORONTO: "It is all pretty vague at the moment. The key really is to get it through quickly. We won't get too much detail today but 1.0 percent of GDP will be pretty decent boost from a fiscal point of view, but it does diminish the Fed's ability to cut interest rates down the road. The key will be what equity markets make of it. It is probably about that people were looking for. Not much more to be said than that. Equity markets perhaps a bit disappointed hoping for more."  OMER ESINER, SENIOR MARKET ANALYST, RUESCH INTERNATIONAL,  WASHINGTON, D.C. "The dollar isn't reacting too much, though stocks have turned negative. In the long run, any attempt to provide stimulus to the economy at this time will be positive for the dollar. We have seen it come off its lows against the yen overnight, and that's in line with a growing view that the government will step in an offer the economy some help. So at the end of the day, that's dollar-positive, intraday volatility notwithstanding."  TIM EVANS, ENERGY ANALYST, CITIGROUP FUTURES RESEARCH, NEW  YORK: "The good news is that the government is taking action that may result in a firmer economic performance six months from now. The bad news is that this rush to action confirms how fragile the economy currently is." "In general it is a nice idea to try to put some extra dollars out there into people's pockets, but I really don't know at this point if they're going to jump in the car and fill up the gas tank and turn up the thermostat. They may want to make a mortgage payment first."  JIM RITTERBUSCH, PRESIDENT AT RITTERBUSCH AND ASSOCIATES IN  GALENA, ILLINOIS: "The crude oil market has been tagging along behind the stock market like a puppy. Oil markets are shifting from their previous focus on the dollar and inventories to the concern about an economic slowdown."  TOM BENTZ, OIL ANALYST FOR BNP PARIBAS COMMODITY FUTURES INC: "The stocks market doesn't seem to be too impressed, so I doubt the oil market will be. The market is fading as the day goes on, it has been having trouble sustaining rallies. All the economic concerns are keeping pressure on the markets. I did think we would get a rally today but we were notable to sustain $91 a barrel. The recent downtrend seems to be intact."  BILL O'NEILL, MANAGING PARTNER, LOGIC ADVISORS, UPPER SADDLE  RIVER, NEW JERSEY: "It's a step in the right direction for the copper market, as long as the Federal Reserve does its part to provide the rate cuts and the other methods to stimulate the economy. It has to be a very coordinated process between the administration, the Congress and the Federal Reserve. It seems like they are all on the same page." "The one thing about gold, in the short term, is that the dollar may move in the trading range pattern as opposed to the straight down pattern. I think in the short term, it looks like gold could be a little on the defensive side. I still think that the long term fundamentals are there, but I do think in the short term the market is looking a little vulnerable."
