 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - After a string of setbacks, British Airways BAY.L shares might be on the verge of a rebound, business weekly Barron's reported. 

 American depository receipts of BA have fallen from 36 in April to 28.76 on Friday amid concerns about labor strikes, a volcanic eruption in Iceland and the euro. In its May 31 edition, Barron's said BA's ADRs could rebound to over 40, even amid a labor dispute, with the successful integration of Iberia, which it acquired last year. On Sunday, members of a BA's cabin crew union began a second five-day strike after talks held last week aimed at resolving the long-running dispute ended without an agreement. Barron's said the airline seemed to be handling walkouts by its cabin crew with "aplomb," as it carried more than 65,000 passengers a day, more than 75 percent of its normal volume. Seven days of walks in March cost BA $62 million. (Reporting by  Steve Eder ; editing by Gunna Dickson)
