 BERLIN  (Reuters) - Talks are continuing with all three bidders for German carmaker Opel, but discussions have been most intense with Fiat and Magna because their offers are the most complex, a German government spokesman said. 

 "Fiat and Magna have submitted more complex blueprints," the spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm told a news conference. The third bidder for Opel is Belgium-listed industrial holding RHJ International. (Reporting by  Kerstin Gehmlich  and  Noah Barkin )
