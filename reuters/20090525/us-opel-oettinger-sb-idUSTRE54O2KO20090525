 MOSCOW  (Reuters) - Germany is likely to make a final decision on Opel by the end of June while bidders have until the middle of next month to submit improved bids, Guenther Oettinger, the Premier of the German state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, said. 

 "I think the final decision is end of June," he told Reuters on Monday. Asked about a deadline for improved bids, he said: "Just now there are close debates... I think by mid of June it will be clear." (Reporting by Dmitry Sergeyev, writing by Dmitry Zhdannikov; editing by Simon Shuster)
