 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - RadioShack Corp ( RSH.N ) said on 
Tuesday that it teamed up with Western Union Co ( WU.N ) and 
wireless company Trumpet Mobile to offer a service that lets 
people wire money through their cellphones. 

  The company said the service -- which allows money to be 
transferred within the United States and to Latin America and 
Caribbean countries -- is aimed at immigrants and customers 
without bank accounts.  (Reporting by  Justin Grant ; Editing by David Cowell)
