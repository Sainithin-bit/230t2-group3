 LONDON  (Reuters) - Global manufacturing activity slowed to its weakest pace in nearly five years in March as growth in factory orders ground to a halt while cost pressures soared, a survey showed on Tuesday. 

 The JP Morgan Global Manufacturing PMI for March eased to 50.8 in March from 51.1 in February, the lowest since May 2003, as the pace of factory growth slowed across the U.S., euro zone and Japan. This is still above the 50.0 mark that divides growth from contraction. The slower pace of growth comes after the U.S. ISM Manufacturing Index hit 48.6 in March, above expectations for a decline to 47.5, but the third time in four months the index has been in negative territory. New orders received by manufacturers slipped to 50.0 in March from 51.4 the previous month, with the rate of growth falling at its fastest in six and half years in the U.S. "Global manufacturers faced the dual headwinds of muted demand and accelerated cost inflationary pressure in March," said David Hensley at JP Morgan in a release. Input prices faced by factories leapt, with that index soaring to 75.9 from 70.9 in February, the second highest in the survey's 10-year history. The index combines survey data from countries including the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, China and Russia. (Reporting by Nigel Davies, editing by David Christian-Edwards)
