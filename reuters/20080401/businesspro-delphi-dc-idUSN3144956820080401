 DETROIT  (Reuters) - A U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge on Monday 
gave auto parts maker Delphi Corp DPHIQ.PK more room to 
complete its reorganization by allowing it to extend looming 
deadlines on agreements with General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) and the 
Internal Revenue Service. 

  Delphi, which filed for bankruptcy in October 2005, has 
been struggling to wrap up exit financing for a reorganization 
plan confirmed by the bankruptcy court in New York in January 
because of tight U.S. credit markets.  Troy, Michigan-based Delphi had sought to emerge from court 
protection by the end of the first quarter, but said recently 
it would emerge as soon as practicable and has been requesting 
extensions for deadlines on various agreements.  Judge Robert Drain allowed Delphi to extend until April 15 
an agreement that allows it to transfer billions of dollars of 
union pension liabilities to former parent GM. The agreement 
was to expire on Monday.  Drain also granted Delphi an extension on pension funding 
waivers with the Internal Revenue Service through April 7 that 
was to expire Monday. Delphi was also allowed to extend letters 
of credit provided to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp until 
April 22 and increase their size by $2.5 million.  Delphi has made nominal contributions to the pensions 
during the reorganization and said in court papers it could 
face penalties of more than $1.4 billion without extensions.  Delphi has sought $6.1 billion of exit financing, including 
up to $2.825 billion of loans from GM. An investor group led by 
Appaloosa Management LP has backed a $2.55 billion equity plan 
to support the reorganization as well.  (Reporting by  David Bailey ; Editing by  Lincoln Feast )
