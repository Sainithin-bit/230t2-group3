 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is probing whether short-sellers are spreading bogus rumors to push down shares of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc,, a person familiar with the matter said on Monday. 

 Shares of Lehman have fallen more than 40 percent since the beginning of February, far more than the broader index, amid market rumors the company was wobbly. Lehman has said on multiple occasions that it has enough money to fund itself, it has ample access to financing, and that customers are standing by it.
