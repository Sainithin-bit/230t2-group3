 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) said on Tuesday that its U.S. sales fell an adjusted 13 percent in March to 282,732 vehicles and left intact its second-quarter production forecast. 

 GM, the largest U.S. automaker, said it had lost nearly 100,000 units of production due to a five-week-old strike at parts supplier American Axle & Manufacturing Holdings Inc  ( AXL.N ). GM also said that its retail market share appears to have remained stable throughout the month and the quarter. (Reporting by  David Bailey , editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
