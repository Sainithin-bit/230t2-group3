 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Chrysler LLC said on Tuesday its U.S. sales fell 19 percent on an unadjusted basis in March due to lower sales to car rental agencies and the industrywide slowdown in sales of large pickup trucks and SUVs. 

 Truck sales fell 22 percent to 118,047 vehicles and car sales fell 13 percent to 48,339 vehicles, Chrysler said. It said it finished March with 423,607 vehicles in inventory, which represented a 66-day supply. (Reporting by  David Bailey ; editing by John Wallace)
