 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - U.S. airline shares vaulted higher alongside the broader stock market on Tuesday with AMR Corp AMR.N, parent of American Airlines, gaining more than 9 percent. 

 One analyst said airline stocks were simply tracking the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  and the Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  -- up 2.3 percent and 2.7 percent, respectively. "I think it's the overall market being up," said Jim Corridore, equity analyst at Standard & Poor's. "The entire market is giddy about the prospects of the economy improving." The Amex airline index  XAL  was up 2.7 percent. AMR was up 8.1 percent at $9.75 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange. UAL Corp UAUA.O, parent of United Airlines, was up 5 percent at $22.61 on Nasdaq. Delta Air Lines ( DAL.N ) rose 7 percent to $9.20 on the NYSE.
