 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Canon Inc's ( 7751.T ) strong quarterly results show the world's largest maker of digital cameras is reaping the benefits of cost cuts and managing to counter the impact of a strong yen. 

 The shares are expected to trade stronger on Thursday as the maker of IXY compact cameras raised its full-year profit outlook on strong sales of office equipment and cameras and beat forecasts with a 74 percent jump in quarterly profit. Along with rival camera makers Sony Corp ( 6758.T ) and Nikon Corp ( 7731.T ), Canon is fighting a rising yen that is crimping the value of overseas earnings. "While the revised forecast is roughly in line with the consensus, I think these are positive figures because some expected Canon to keep its outlook given the yen's gain," said Naoki Fujiwara, a fund manager at Shinkin Asset Management. In the longer term, analysts say Canon may have trouble expanding sales enough to meet its ambitious 2012 profit goal of a record profit, which would need to beat the 2007 operating profit of about 757 billion yen. On Wednesday, Canon shaved 40 billion yen off its full-year sales forecast of 3.75 trillion yen. Sales of Canon's EOS digital single-lens reflex (SLR) cameras, high-end models with interchangeable lenses, struck a record high for the month in September despite Sony's attempts to make inroads into the market with new, lightweight models. Canon edged up its full-year sales forecast for digital SLR camera sales for 2010 to 5.7 million from 5.5 million. "I think shares will rise on this tomorrow, if only slightly, in comparison with TOPIX  .TOPX ," said Ryosuke Okazaki, senior vice president at ITC Investment Partners in Tokyo, referring to Canon's results and the broader share index. The results marked the fourth straight quarter of year-on-year profit growth for Canon. Sony unveils earnings on Friday and Nikon on November 4. Profits in Canon's office equipment business grew 30 percent, while Xerox Corp ( XRX.N ), Canon's rival in office equipment, also beat quarterly profit estimates last week, signaling a rebound in companies' confidence about spending. Overall, Canon's sales grew in all geographical areas except Japan. Last month, Chairman Fujio Mitarai said he was keen to pursue growth via merger and acquisition opportunities in medical and industrial technology. Mitarai returned full-time to his post five months ago after a four-year stint as chairman of Japan's big business lobby. YEN WORRY Canon revised its dollar-yen exchange rate assumption to 80 from 90 yen. Many other Japanese firms had also set their dollar rate assumptions at 90 yen. The dollar has slumped to 15-year lows and stood at about 81.7 yen on Wednesday. "We don't think the yen will continue to rise in a one-sided manner," said Canon executive vice-president Toshizo Tanaka. "We think it will stay around the current level of 80 yen. But it will take a while to see a clear economic recovery in America." For the full year to December 31, Canon now expects operating profit of 390 billion yen ($4.79 billion) versus a previous forecast of 360 billion yen and just under a consensus forecast of 396.4 billion yen in a poll of 16 analysts by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Canon's July-September operating profit was 104.42 billion yen, compared with 59.9 billion a year ago and a consensus forecast of 89.5 billion yen in a poll of four analysts by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Canon shares have fallen about 7 percent so far this year, compared with an 11 percent fall in the Nikkei average  .N225 . Its shares ended 2.3 percent lower on Wednesday in a flat broader market  .N225  ahead of the results.
