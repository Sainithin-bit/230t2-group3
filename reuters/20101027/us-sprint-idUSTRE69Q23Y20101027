 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Sprint Nextel's ( S.N ) failure to turn around its wireless subscriber business in a period when investors bet heavily on growth sent its shares down about 9 percent. 

 The No. 3 U.S. mobile operator promised a better fourth quarter, but did not specify if it would continue to lose subscribers or begin adding more high value, bill-paying customers again. Helped by the EVO smartphone from HTC Corp ( 2498.TW ), Sprint the No. 3 U.S. mobile operator, posted a third-quarter net loss of 107,000 customers who pay monthly bills compared with analyst expectations for a loss of 173,500 and losses of 801,000 customers a year earlier. But this was not a big enough change for shareholders who had pushed its shares up 20 percent since late August in the hope this customer segment would start growing again in the third quarter. "Expectations got ahead of themselves," said Mizuho analyst Michael Nelson, who saw the results as a "vast improvement" from previous quarters, but he noted it would take Sprint "another couple of quarters to start growing the postpaid base." Sprint has struggled to retain customers since its 2005 purchase of Nextel Communications, which operated the iDen network that was incompatible with Sprint's existing technology and does not support high speed Web surfing. While the company has sought to address complaints over customer service issues and network problems, including a possible plan to combine the two networks, Sprint is still losing customers it acquired from Nextel. Its rivals have fared much better. Verizon Wireless added 584,000 postpaid customers in the third quarter and AT&T Inc ( T.N ), the No 2 U.S. mobile service and exclusive U.S. provider for Apple Inc's ( AAPL.O ) iPhone, added 745,000 subscribers. SMARTPHONES PRESSURE MARGINS Like other wireless providers, Sprint is dependent on smartphones and new devices for growth. But it comes at a cost. The company's Chief Executive, Dan Hesse, said more new device launches would put further pressure on profits and would mean more subsidies in the fourth quarter, the busiest quarter of the year for phone sales. "We hope they put pressure on our subsidies," he told reporters on a conference call. "It's better than the alternative." Sprint reported its third-quarter net loss had widened to $911 million, or 30 cents per share from $478 million, or 17 cents per share in the same quarter a year ago. The latest quarterly loss included a massive tax-related charge and was 2 cents wider than Wall Street expectations of 28 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. One bright spot in the third quarter was a slight revenue increase to $8.15 billion from $8.04 billion a year earlier and compared with the average analyst expectation for $8.04 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It was the company's first revenue increase that was not caused by an acquisition since 2007, but the company's Chief Financial Officer Bob Brust noted revenue would come under pressure in the fourth quarter in both landline and wireless. Hesse would not say if the company could increase revenue again in the fourth quarter. He told reporters consumers should also expect a tablet computer based on the WiMax technology, which powers Sprint's fourth-generation (4G) high-speed wireless service. "You should be surprised if that wasn't one being planned. We won't say when but stay tuned," he said. Sprint has the advantage of being the first U.S. operator to sell phones based on 4G services. Its biggest rival Verizon wireless will not have 4G phones until next year. But Hesse said on a conference call that: "We know they'll be on our heels pretty quickly." The executive said Sprint is in talks with its Clearwire Corp CLWR.O venture about options for new funding to expand its network, which Sprint uses to offer 4G services. One option could be for Sprint, which already owns about 55 percent of Clearwire, to invest more in the venture. Sprint shares were down 45 cents, or 9.4 percent, at $4.32 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by Sinead Carew; editing by  Derek Caney , Dave Zimmerman and  Andre Grenon )
