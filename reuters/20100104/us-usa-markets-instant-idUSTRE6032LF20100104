 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. manufacturing sector grew for a fifth consecutive month in December, hitting its highest level since April 2006, but construction spending fell for a seventh straight month. 

 KEY POINTS: * The Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity rose to 55.9 in December from 53.6 in November. The median forecast of 60 economists surveyed by Reuters was for a reading of 54.3. * The December reading was the highest since April 2006. CONSTRUCTION SPENDING: U.S. construction spending fell more than expected in November to its lowest level in over six years, dragged down by a sharp decline in private home building, government data showed on Monday. KEY POINTS: * The Commerce Department said construction spending fell 0.6 percent, declining for a seventh straight month, to $900.1 billion, the lowest level since July 2003. October's construction spending was revised down to show a 0.5 percent drop, instead of being flat as the government previously reported. * Economists surveyed by Reuters had forecast construction spending would decline by 0.4 percent in November. * Spending on private home building dropped 1.6 percent in November, the biggest decline since June, after rising 4.8 percent the prior month. * Spending on public construction projects fell 0.4 percent in November after being flat in October. Spending on healthcare, highways and streets fell from October, while investment in power and communication projects increased, the department reported. COMMENTS: MARC PADO, U.S. MARKET STRATEGIST, CANTOR FITZGERALD & CO, SAN FRANCISCO: "The focus right now is on (corporate) earnings and any number that shows us that the picture is better than expected, which this number does, is going to bring to light a positive earnings season in the next two to three weeks. That, I think, is going to push the market to its peak in January -- it's going to be earnings, and this is a number that supports that." TORSTEN SLOK, SENIOR ECONOMIST, DEUTSCHE BANK, NEW YORK "This is definitely better than expected and a very solid reading. It means that the recovery is on track and even the details here if you look at both the production numbers 61.8 was continuing ongoing improvement. "For the Fed, the key number-one issue is to what extent they will continue to use the 'extended period' language. "This has to change the Fed-speak and Fed body language going forward. Things are improving, suggesting that they may eventually have to look very carefully at the extended period language. "The biggest risk indeed is that the current recovery is driven mainly by the fiscal stimulus. Up to this point about 32 percent of the fiscal stimulus has been paid out. Once the fiscal stimulus starts to fade, once the government steps away from supporting the economy, that will be the real test. That will be in the second half of 2010. We still have six months where the economy is on important life support from government stimulus." KEVIN FLANAGAN, FIXED INCOME STRATEGIST FOR GLOBAL WEALTH MANAGEMENT, MORGAN STANLEY, PURCHASE, NEW YORK: "The ISM report is certainly showing the recovery process is entrenched. We are looking to see if we can build now on this recovery. This will be the theme early in the first quarter: what kind of recovery are we looking at. "Manufacturing will continue to be an area that provides support to the U.S. economy. Developing countries are doing well and there is certainly a demand for U.S. exports. "Treasuries are unchanged to slightly weaker. You finished out 2009 with some flight-to-quality buying. Now that it is no longer year end, with the economic data, Treasuries will have to stand on their own two feet." DOUG ROBERTS, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CHANNEL CAPITAL RESEARCH.COM, SHREWSBURY, NEW JERSEY: "Kind of an improvement over where we thought it would be so maintaining the trend. Construction numbers were a bit worse than expected. But for the most part, what it means is the economy right now is repairing but doesn't seem to be repairing enough to change the Fed's position if you listen to what Bernanke has been saying. "Right now the reaction came with the speaking down in Atlanta. What people are really concerned with right now is the tightening of liquidity. These numbers, although an improvement, better than expectations, it doesn't look like it will be anything significant enough to cause pressure to the Bernanke opinion." ALAN LANCZ, PRESIDENT, ALAN B. LANCZ & ASSOCIATES INC, TOLEDO, OHIO: "This is what we need in 2010 for a V-shaped recovery. This bodes well for the situation now. It's a very positive sign to have the ISM follow-through after months of improvement in leading indicators. Being over the 50 level is important, but having an increase on top of that especially bodes well. Looks like we're off to a fresh start for the year and the economy continues to roll along. I think this could be part of a trend with stimulus and a more positive outlook. Until we see interest rates moving up, we're pretty positive that the numbers will continue to move up. DAVID SLOAN, ECONOMIST, 4CAST LTD, NEW YORK: "It was generally positive ISM data, there is no real dispute about it -- it was stronger across the board. New orders were very encouraging, employment was positive and prices were up so it is a sign of manufacturing recovery. "Construction spending was not a surprise; it is still weak." DAN COOK, SENIOR MARKET ANALYST, IG MARKETS, CHICAGO: "A pretty positive number. A good way to start the year. It remains to be seen whether this will help or hurt the dollar. We have the divergence where good data helped the dollar which we had not seen through most of the year. Whether people are speculating on interest rates or something else the initial reaction is dollar positive." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stock indexes rose a bit. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices firmed slightly. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar was modestly stronger against the euro.
