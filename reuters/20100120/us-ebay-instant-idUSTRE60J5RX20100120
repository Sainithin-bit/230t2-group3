 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - EBay Inc reported a higher-than-expected profit for the fourth quarter, helped by a strong performance from its PayPal online payments service, as well as growth in its main online marketplaces unit. 

 The company, whose shares rose 5 percent in after-hours trading, said profit excluding items was 44 cents per share, compared to the average analyst forecast of 40 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. COMMENTARY: LARRY WITT, STOCK ANALYST, MORNINGSTAR "I thought (eBay's results) looked pretty good, the best they have looked in at least a year. Auction volume has stopped falling, which is a good thing for them. PayPal is hitting the ball out of the park. Guidance is what we expected." On outlook: "Historically, they tend to guide pretty conservatively and I wouldn't be surprised if they are thinking they'll do better." "(Shares) are up a little more than 3 percent -- as far as what's driving it: the outperformance and the core marketplace business is stabilizing." On gross merchandise volume (GMV): "The numbers were good -- the best growth in almost a couple of years. Part of that was juiced a little by the acquisition last year. Their GMV grew excluding currency by 17 percent ... if you exclude the acquisition, it was up 8 percent. That is pretty good for them." "I'd say you are seeing the signs of a turnaround. This is the best growth rate they have seen in years ... We are seeing some rebound to growth. It's fair to say a turnaround is taking shape. I think you're gonna see more of the same (in 2010). They are going to continue to focus on the core business. You will see PayPal gain penetration online and potentially some acquisitions. They have more than $5 billion in cash now and I would be surprised if they want to deploy it." TIM BOYD, ANALYST, MKM PARTNERS "It was a strong finish for the year. Overall gross merchandise volume grew 20 percent globally but clearly continued weakness in the U.S. was offset by strength in the international marketplace." "The guidance was uninspiring because it was light on revenue but that's probably because they're being conservative." He said the earnings report could be construed as a positive barometer for Amazon. BENJAMIN SCHACHTER, SENIOR INTERNET ANALYST, BROADPOINT AMTECH "Generally speaking, the initial take is pretty good -- overall it looks pretty good. (The share price) is not moving too much but I think people are pleased to see things are actually pretty good and they are benefiting from the macro-environment." "The core business is showing some rebound and PayPal is benefiting from e-commerce growth and the rebound. (Their gross merchandise volume number) looks okay. It's not knocking the cover off the ball. (The strength of the rebound) is still too early to gauge. The guidance here is pretty good but we have to see how the turnaround takes shape." MARC PADO, U.S. MARKET STRATEGIST, CANTOR FITZGERALD & CO, SAN FRANCISCO "It looked like a modest beat on revenue and the net." "The official expectations were below (the numbers) but the so-called whisper was (for) more." "I think it's a net positive for market valuations where they are."
