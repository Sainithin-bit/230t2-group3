 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co ( WFC.N ) swung to a fourth-quarter profit on a pickup in fee income, even as it repaid $25 billion in bailout funds to the U.S. government. 

 The fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets reported a profit of $2.82 billion, or 8 cents a share. Analysts on average expected a loss of 1 cent a share, according to Thomson Reuters    I/B/E/S. In the fourth quarter of 2008, excluding the impact of Wachovia Corp, which Wells Fargo bought at the end of the year, it reported a loss of $2.73 billion, or 84 cents a share. While analysts broadly view the San Francisco-based bank as among the stronger survivors of the financial crisis, it is facing mounting losses on Wachovia mortgage portfolios. Loan losses jumped to $5.9 billion in the fourth quarter from $3 billion a year earlier, driven by residential and commercial mortgage losses. But the bank set aside just $5.9 billion against loan losses in the quarter, compared with $8.4 billion a year earlier. Chief Financial Officer Howard Atkins said losses from Wachovia are "tracking better than originally estimated at the time of the merger." Offsetting credit losses was a surge in revenue from the bank's fee-based businesses, such as investment management and mortgage servicing. Noninterest income climbed to $11.2 billion in the fourth quarter from $2.8 billion, excluding Wachovia, a year earlier. Wells Fargo shares climbed 3 percent in premarket trading to $29.10. Last month Wells Fargo repaid a $25 billion government bailout it received in October 2008 under the Troubled Asset Relief Program. The bank sold $12.25 billion in stock to help fund the repayment.
