 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley lost $807 million in 2009, but its employees got a combined payday of $14.4 billion, the bank said Wednesday. 

 Even as Wall Street faces a public backlash for issuing outsized paychecks so soon after the taxpayer rescue of the banking industry, Morgan Stanley set aside an eye-popping 62 percent of revenues for compensation in 2009. Most banks set aside closer to 45 or 50 percent. The $14.4 billion payout was up from $11 billion last year, a 31 percent hike. "They are paying up to retain people and mitigate the discomfort employees felt in 2008," said Marshall Sonenshine, chairman of boutique investment bank Sonenshine Partners in New York. "They are now creating some discomfort for investors," Sonenshine added. Morgan Stanley's compensation in percentage terms could decrease over time. It was inflated in part by pay to employees in connection with the formation of the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney joint venture with Citigroup Inc. Morgan Stanley has lagged behind rival Goldman Sachs Group Inc, which has been robustly profitable and is on pace to set aside a record $22.3 billion for compensation this year. Morgan Stanley returned to profitability in the third quarter after reporting three straight losing quarters. The firm posted a $413 million profit for the fourth quarter, which after preferred stock dividends amounted to 29 cents a share. But the profit fell 7 cents a share short of Wall Street's average expectations, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S and the bank posted a loss of 76 cents per share for the year. Weak trading results, which had powered the banking industry's recovery from the financial crisis, weighed on Morgan Stanley's fourth-quarter earnings. Morgan Stanley's trading revenue dropped 65 percent to $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter from $3.2 billion in the third quarter. Morgan Stanley shares were trading for $30.64 in afternoon dealings, down 52 cents or about 1.7 percent. "We all knew the trading results were off," said Anton Schutz, president of Mendon Capital. "It just wasn't a good quarter to trade, particularly fixed income. The volumes weren't there." The results were hampered by accounting charges related to the appreciation of the value of the firm's debt, which reduced fourth-quarter earnings by $600 million. "It does have a significant impact, at least at the headline level," said Les Satlow, portfolio manager at Cabot Money Management. "Having said that, I still think the trading results should have been better." TOUGH DECISIONS In making year-end decisions, Morgan Stanley had to decide whether to reward employees or shareholders -- and it clearly chose to reward employees, analysts said. "They obviously think that is the right thing to do as a business matter," Sonenshine said. Colm Kelleher, co-president of Morgan Stanley Institutional Securities, said in an interview that pay had become a populist issue and that the firm was working to balance competitive pressures with shareholders' interests in setting compensation. The firm is joining in an industry trend to pay top performers largely in equity in an effort to tie pay to long-term performance. Former chief executive John Mack, who stepped down at the start of the year, did not accept a bonus for 2009. Mack retained his role as chairman. New CEO James Gorman told investors that he is "bullish" on Morgan Stanley and that the firm is well-positioned to capitalize on the recovery of the capital markets. Gorman named his own leadership team last month, hiring Greg Fleming, a former Merrill Lynch president and chief operating officer, to run Morgan Stanley's investment management group. "James Gorman has put together a very solid team that was forged through the crisis of 2008 and is very much hell-bent on rebuilding this business," Kelleher said.
