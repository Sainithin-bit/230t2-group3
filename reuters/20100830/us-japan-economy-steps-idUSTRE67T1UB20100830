 (Reuters) - Japan decided on Monday to compile economic steps using 920 billion yen ($10.8 billion) in reserves from this fiscal year's budget, as the strong yen threatens to derail the country's fragile economic recovery. 

 Prime Minister Naoto Kan said that the cabinet would decide details of the steps on September 10, adding that the government could compile an extra budget if needed depending on future economic and job conditions. Following are key comments and steps mentioned in the outline of economic steps, approved by relevant economic ministers on Monday. -- The economic policy goal for the time being is to beat deflation and put the Japanese economy on a full-fledged recovery path. -- Downward economic risks are increasing as the yen continues to rise and worries grow over a slowdown in overseas economies. -- Excessive moves in currency markets will have a negative impact on the stability of economic and financial conditions. We will continue to closely monitor currency moves and take decisive action as needed. -- The Bank of Japan further eased monetary policy at an emergency meeting on Monday. We hope the BOJ will continue to cooperate with the government and take appropriate and flexible monetary policy to support the economy. -- The government will promote and accelerate its growth strategy, including compiling a program around October to November to promote domestic investment such as helping firms to keep factories and headquarters in Japan. -- The government said it would support the following five areas: jobs, investment, consumer spending, disaster prevention measures and deregulation. Details are as follows. JOBS: * Help young people find jobs by having more career counselors at colleges and increasing the number of internships. * Boost jobs by offering financial support to small and medium-sized firms. INVESTMENT: * Prevent companies from moving factories overseas by promoting energy efficient industries and supporting technology development at small and medium-sized firms. CONSUMER SPENDING: * Extend a low-interest housing loan scheme for environmentally friendly homes and incentive programs in which consumers buying environmentally friendly homes or electrical appliances are awarded "points" that can be exchanged for products or coupons. DISASTER PREVENTION MEASURES: * Take steps to make hospitals more resistant to earthquakes and take measures to prepare for possible heavy rains and other disasters. DEREGULATION * Promote deregulation in urban development, environment and energy sectors, healthcare and tourism. ($1=85.37 Yen) (Reporting by  Yoko Nishikawa  and  Chisa Fujioka )
