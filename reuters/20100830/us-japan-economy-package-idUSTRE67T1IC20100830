 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan will carefully watch currency moves and take decisive action when needed, the government said on Monday in an outline of its measures to support the economy. 

 In the outline, the government also said it hopes the Bank of Japan continues to communicate closely with the government, and take appropriate and flexible monetary policy to support the economy. (Reporting by  Leika Kihara ; Editing by Edmund Klamann)
