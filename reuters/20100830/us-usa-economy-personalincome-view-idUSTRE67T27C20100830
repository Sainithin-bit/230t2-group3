 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending rose at the strongest pace in four months in July, supported by a small gain in incomes, offering hope that consumers will be able to keep contributing to a modest recovery. 

 KEY POINTS: * The Commerce Department said on Monday spending increased 0.4 percent in July, the largest gain since March, after being flat in June. * Analysts polled by Reuters had expected consumer spending to rise 0.3 percent. COMMENTS: JOHN CANALLY, ECONOMIST/INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, LPL FINANCIAL, BOSTON: "On the real wage side, you had a good bump that's a sign that income is recovering from the recession. On the spending side, the quarter is off to a solid start. It's not a booming one by any means. On the inflation side, you are not getting a good dose of it so that's good news. But this is not going to convince people that the Fed will not conduct more quantitative easing if there is more weakness." JIM AWAD, MANAGING DIRECTOR, ZEPHYR MANAGEMENT, NEW YORK: "The spending is in line with estimates, income a little less. This isn't going to be market moving. "Consumers spending more than income grows doesn't speak well for future growth. You want to see people gradually increase savings at this time. Stronger growth now robs from future growth, so this could be a current positive but a future negative." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stock index futures tick slightly higher after data. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices steady at higher levels. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar holds losses versus yen, gains versus euro.
