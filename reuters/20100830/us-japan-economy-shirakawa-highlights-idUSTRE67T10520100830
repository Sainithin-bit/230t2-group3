 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said on Monday the central bank needs to carefully examine the drawbacks when considering cutting already low interest rates. 

 He also told a news conference he saw little need now to increase the BOJ's purchases of long-term government bonds from the current 21.6 trillion yen ($253 billion) per year. As widely expected, the BOJ kept its policy rate at 0.1 percent and expanded its fund supply tool at an emergency meeting on Monday, saving more aggressive steps for when there is clearer evidence of a slowdown in a fragile economy. Following are key quotes from Shirakawa's news conference: MONETARY POLICY "(Board member) Suda voted against today's monetary easing on the view that data showed Japan's economy was moving in line with the BOJ's expectations, and that more time was needed to gauge the impact that stock and currency moves had on the economy. "She was also opposed on the view that acting now would be interpreted as aimed at influencing exchange-rate moves ... "The BOJ will act appropriately and in a timely manner, taking into account economic and price developments as well as changes in market moves ... "When considering the effects and drawbacks, I see the current amount of government-bond purchases by the BOJ as appropriate ... "I won't rule out any specific policy option and have no preset idea on future policy. But currently interest rates are low and near zero. We need to carefully examine the drawbacks when considering cutting interest rates further ... "We decided to ease policy today by examining the outlook for the economy, including the impact from currency moves." ECONOMY "Uncertainty over the U.S. economy has heightened and this has led to unstable moves in currency and stock markets. We therefore judged that we need to more carefully watch out for downside risks to Japan's economy ... "Several weak U.S. figures came out, while the yen rose and stock prices fell. When we saw this, we decided that we need to take more precautions against risks to the outlook ... "An increasing number of board members gradually felt that downside risks (to Japan's economy) were increasing ... "Today's meeting was an emergency one so we couldn't spend as much time as at the regular rate review examining economic and price conditions. Looking at data that came out from Japan, they were somewhat strong. But there are risks to the outlook, so we cannot rule out revising down our economic scenario in the future."
