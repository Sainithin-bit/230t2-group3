 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Tyco International Ltd. ( TYC.N ) aims to rely on gaining ground in its core markets, including fire and security systems, and increase core revenue 4 percent to 6 percent annually after it spins off its electronics and health-care business, company officials said on Tuesday. 

 The conglomerate plans to split into three parts later this month, with Tyco International continuing as a stand-alone company. Tyco Electronics and Covidien health care will then operate as independent, publicly traded entities. The company aims for long-term revenue growth, factoring out the effect of any acquisitions, of about 4 percent to 6 percent a year, said Chris Coughlin, executive vice president and chief financial officer. "We are going to focus on organic growth initiatives," Edward Breen, Tyco's chairman and chief executive, told investors in New York. Referring to the fire, security and engineered-products segments, he said: "They are extremely fragmented industries from a competitive standpoint ... that's one of the keys to the future success of Tyco, is how we go about changing that landscape." By way of example, Breen estimated that the world electronic security market is a $65 billion business. He said that Tyco's 11 percent share of that market makes it the leader, with "thousands" of companies carving up about 75 percent of the market. The businesses that will remain in Tyco International generated about $18.6 billion in proforma revenue last year, the company said. Breen, who will continue as chairman and CEO of Tyco International after the spin-offs, said that Tyco would continue to make small "tuck-in" acquisitions of related businesses while focusing much of its investment on the growth of its existing businesses and internal restructuring. PUTTING THE PAST BEHIND IT Former chief Dennis Kozlowski, who in 2005 began serving a prison sentence for looting Tyco, proposed a break-up in 2002. Those plans were put on ice as the company worked to repair its image, which had come to be defined by a notorious $6,000 shower curtain and a $15,000 umbrella stand purchased for Kozlowski with company funds. Breen emphasized that the company has put the problems of the Kozlowski era behind it. "The legacy issues are behind us, the balance sheets are all in great shape," Breen said. Tyco International expects to take about $350 million to $400 million in restructuring charges in 2007 and 2008 as it better integrates its operations, Breen said. Noting that Tyco International has recently paid about $800 million in shareholder dividends each year, Coughlin said that amount would be broken down among the three after the spin-offs. Tyco International expects to pay about $230 million in shareholder dividends each year, with Tyco Electronics paying about $280 million and Covidien paying about $300 million, Coughlin said. After the breakup, Tyco Electronics plans to trade under the symbol "TEL," while Covidien health care will adopt the symbol "COV." Both will trade on the New York and Bermuda stock exchanges. The top executives of Tyco Electronics and Covidien are scheduled to speak to investors later Tuesday. Tyco International shares were down 7 cents at $34.02 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange. They are up 11.9 percent so far this year, roughly in line with the 11.6 percent gain in the Standard & Poor's capital goods index. .GSPIC (Additional reporting by  Chris Reiter  in New York)
