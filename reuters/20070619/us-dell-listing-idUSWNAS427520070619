 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Dell Inc. DELL.O said it was informed by Nasdaq that it was not in compliance with the exchange's stock-listing requirements after it delayed filing first-quarter financial results with regulators. 

 Dell, the world's second-largest, personal computer maker, said it expected the Nasdaq finding, which follows earlier non-compliance determinations as Dell has delayed filing financial statements with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission pending an audit of its accounting practices. Dell has not filed required financial statements for the second and third quarters of its fiscal 2007 and its annual report for 2007, as well as for the first quarter of 2008. The company has asked a Nasdaq panel to extend Dell's conditional stock listing while it completes its overdue statements.
