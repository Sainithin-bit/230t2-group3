 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bids for the main index of subprime mortgage bonds dropped to a record low on Tuesday as concerns of losses at a hedge fund and weak housing suggest a deeper downturn for the debt. 

 The ABX-HE BBB- 07-1 was bid at 59.24 on Tuesday, down from levels above 60 on Monday, according to dealer indications to a portfolio manager. Losses at a hedge fund run by top mortgage bond dealer Bear Stearns Cos. BSC.N have captivated the industry as investors prepare for possible sales of low-rated assets from the fund. Bear Stearns last week sold about $4 billion of the fund's best bonds to cover losses, and today is meeting with creditors and private equity firm Blackstone Group to prevent its collapse, according to people familiar with the situation. A government report on Tuesday showed U.S. housing starts set an annual pace of 1.474 million units in May, off from the 1.506 million rate in April. The National Association of Home Builders on Monday said its confidence index is at its lowest level in 16 years. "Everyone is still pretty bearish in ABX space," said Chris Sullivan, chief investment officer for the United Nations Federal Credit Union in New York. "Shorts are being increased, it seems." The fallout from poor underwriting practices and the housing slump now in its second year are expected to take a toll on markets until at least 2008, many economists predict. Rising delinquencies and foreclosures cause losses to the bondholders who receive principal and interest from homeowners' monthly payments. The series of ABX indexes contain bonds backed by subprime mortgages, and are used by hedge funds and other investors to hedge exposure to the market. By "shorting" the index, they bet on declines in the price while a dealer counterparty accepts the "long" position.
