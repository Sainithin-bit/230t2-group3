 ROME  (Reuters) - Italy has allowed U.S. private equity firm MatlinPatterson to re-enter the bidding for national airline Alitalia AZPIa.MI, boosting an auction that has been rattled by concern that Aeroflot ( AFLT.MM ) might pull out. 

 Italy has barred any new contenders in the auction, but one government source said the firm was not technically a new entrant since it had earlier formed part of a consortium with fellow U.S. private equity company TPG TPG.UL. That consortium withdrew from the auction last month citing difficulties with the conditions imposed by Italy, leaving just smaller Italian carrier Air One and Aeroflot in the running for the unprofitable airline. The Italian treasury said MatlinPatterson could access Alitalia's books starting on Tuesday and present a binding offer for the airline, worth about $1.3 billion on the market. A senior executive at Aeroflot, which on Monday denied it was pulling out of the auction but complained about Alitalia's price tag, said the appearance of a new bidder could have an impact on the Russian flag carrier's own plans. "All conditions are significant for us and can have an influence on our decision. Especially if they change during the course of a tender," Aeroflot's deputy chief executive, Lev Koshlyakov, told Reuters. "This will probably add further questions over how this contest has been organised," added Koshlyakov, who declined to say whether Aeroflot would pull out of the process. Alitalia shares fell in morning trade before paring losses to rise more than 2 percent in afternoon trade, with one trader blaming it on speculative trading in the stock. FRAGILE AUCTION The auction is now heading into the final stretch, with binding offers for the airline to be submitted by July 2. Italian newspapers have speculated this could be extended, however. Another source close to the auction said the so-called dataroom that gives bidders access to confidential financial information was initially set to close on June 13 but this was extended to June 28. Alitalia's auction looked increasingly fragile on Monday after Aeroflot said it would not buy the airline at just any price, though it denied a Russian news agency report that it had pulled out of the bidding. That sparked fears the auction would be left with just Air One, a much smaller private carrier whose annual revenues do not match up to Alitalia's annual losses. Citigroup on Tuesday cut its price target on Alitalia to 0.50 euros per share and maintained its sell rating on the stock. Among other reasons, it cited a substantial cash injection needed at the airline and the likelihood that it would not turn a profit until at least 2010 by its own devices. The airline, which has not reported an annual profit since 1999, was put up for sale by Rome in December in a final attempt to turn it around after repeated restructuring efforts failed to do so. The Italian government owns 49.9 percent of Alitalia and is looking for a buyer for at least a 39.9 percent stake, but is willing to sell its entire holding if needed. The airline has been burdened by high costs, strike-prone labor unions and frequent government meddling in its affairs. Its auction initially attracted 11 bidders before the list was whittled down to three contenders that met the criteria for presenting binding offers. Italy, which had said no new entrants would be allowed after an April 2 cut-off for adding new entities to existing groups, did not give a reason for MatlinPatterson's return.
