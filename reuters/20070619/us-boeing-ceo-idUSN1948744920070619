 LE BOURGET  (Reuters) - Boeing Co.'s ( BA.N ) Chief Executive hailed this year's Paris Air Show as a success for the U.S. plane maker on Tuesday, despite trailing rival Airbus in orders after two days of frenzied announcements at the show. 

 "Was it a good show for Boeing? Yes," Boeing CEO Jim McNerney told reporters at the Paris show. "We like orders to come when they come, which fortunately they have been doing at a pretty steady drumbeat." Airbus has claimed orders for 387 planes so far at the show, compared with Boeing's 109. Boeing's orders tend to be more evenly spread out over the year, whereas Airbus's often come in bunches at major air shows. The latest order figures, if classified as firm, would even up the race for sales this year between the two firms. Boeing outsold Airbus more than two to one in the first five months of the year. Boeing collected a deal for 63 planes worth a total of $8.8 billion on Tuesday with International Lease Finance Corp., the world's largest plane lessor by fleet value. McNerney did acknowledge Airbus's haul of orders at the show, and paid testament to the rival firm's chief. He introduced himself as "Louis Gallois's best friend" at a Boeing cocktail reception on Tuesday, referring to the head of Airbus, who joked earlier in the day that he would send a brochure for Airbus's new A350 jet to McNerney. "He is a fine leader and he had a good show," McNerney said of Gallois. The two know each other from previous jobs, when McNerney worked for General Electric Co.'s ( GE.N ) aerospace unit and Gallois for French engine maker Snecma. McNerney said more orders are likely from the large U.S. carriers, whose plane fleets are aging. "We're having deeper discussions with legacy carriers," said McNerney, which could lead to orders late this year or early next. Delta Air Lines Inc. ( DAL.N ) said on Monday it was weighing up a multi-billion dollar order for mid-sized widebody planes this year. Other large carriers such as Northwest Airlines Corp. NWA.N and UAL Corp.'s UAUA.O United Airlines are expected to make orders in the next year or so.
