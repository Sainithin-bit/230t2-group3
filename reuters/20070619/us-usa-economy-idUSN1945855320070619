 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. home construction fell last month for the first time since January as builders struggled with a glut of unsold homes, but permits for future building rose, offering mixed signals on the housing outlook. 

 Housing starts slipped 2.1 percent to an annual pace of 1.474 million units in May compared with a 1.506 million unit pace in April, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday. The level of starts was a touch below what was expected on Wall Street, but permits for future groundbreaking rose 3 percent to a faster-than-expected 1.501 million unit rate. Prices of U.S. government bonds rose, pulling yields lower, as traders viewed the drop in construction as a sign the housing sector would continue to weigh on the economy. The lower bond yields gave a lift to U.S. stocks. Some economists said the rise in permits could signal a sharp slide in the U.S. housing sector was beginning to ease. "While there are still considerable headwinds working against housing, signs are emerging that the overall trend in housing is stabilizing," said Bart Melek, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets. "But ... the trough could be very prolonged." Other analysts, however, were less certain housing was reaching bottom and warned that trouble in the subprime mortgage sector, rising interest rates and the high level of unsold homes on the market could mean further distress ahead. In addition, while building permits rose, the uptick was concentrated in multifamily units. Permits for single-family home starts fell 1.8 percent to their lowest since July 1997. "That's another indication that things are going to stay weak," said David Resler, chief economist with Nomura Securities International in New York. WEST TAKES A HIT The report showed how hard the once-thriving housing market on the West Coast had been hit. Housing starts there were off 38 percent in May from a year ago -- the largest year-on-year drop since a 49 percent decline in March 1991. In May alone, starts dropped by nearly 20 percent in the West. They were also off a bit in the South, which accounts for the lion's share of construction. However, they rose by more than 15 percent in both the Northeast and Midwest. A sharp slowdown in U.S. home sales has flooded the market with unsold homes and prompted builders to sharply curtail activity. A report on Monday showed home-builder confidence at its lowest level in over 16 years, a finding that stood in contrast to the optimism suggested by the rise in permits. Excess inventory, growing foreclosures among borrowers with damaged credit and climbing mortgage rates have led economists to extend their timeline for a housing market recovery. Many think the sector will not fully recover until next year. Mortgage rates have risen sharply in recent weeks along with yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which hit a five-year high of 5.33 percent last week. The 10-year yield has since retreated to about 5.09 percent. A senior economist with the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank said in an interview posted on the regional Fed bank's Web site that woes for borrowers with damaged credit will continue to act as a drag on the housing sector. "Unwinding the dramatic rise in nonprime mortgages could have a noticeable effect on home construction beyond what we've seen through the first quarter," Dallas Fed economist John Duca said. Duca noted some industry analysts believe home building could slow by another 10 percent to 15 percent. "With nonprime lending at nearly 40 percent last year, the effect could be even greater," he warned. Two separate reports on Tuesday painted a muddled picture for the retail sector, with chain store sales sluggish last week. Redbook Research said sales growth slowed 2 percent from a year ago. The International Council of Shopping Centers and UBS Securities said in a joint report that sales rose only 1.9 percent.
