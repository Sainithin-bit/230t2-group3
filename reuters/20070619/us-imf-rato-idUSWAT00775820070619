 TORONTO  (Reuters) - The United States economy is likely to regain momentum as the drag from the current housing correction and softness in the business sector eases, the head of the International Monetary Fund said on Tuesday. 

 In text prepared for a speech in Toronto, IMF Managing Director Rodrigo Rato said the situation in the U.S. housing market was "more ambiguous" but added that the effects from problems in the subprime mortgage market appeared to be limited. "We believe that the U.S. economic prospects are good," Rato told the Economic Club of Toronto. Turning to global financial markets, Rato said he was concerned with investors' attitudes about risk. In particular, he said he was worried that a shift in monetary policy in major economies will change investors' willingness to take on risk and, if so, how this will play out in the markets. "On the face of it, there appears to be a greater willingness to take risks in financial markets, motivated in part by the search for yield and in part by greater ease in transferring risk," he said. "However, I am less concerned about a general shift in risk preferences than I am about places where markets still seem complacent about risk," he added. He said some lenders may also have become complacent about credit risk because of the rapid rise of risk-transfer markets. "We know credit risk is being transferred, but it is often not clear who it is being transferred to, or whether the ultimate holders of these risks fully understand them and can manage them prudently," he added. The IMF chief also called for greater scrutiny by regulators of hedge funds and risks related to the dramatic growth in large private equity buyouts, which are being financed by a rising proportion of debt.
