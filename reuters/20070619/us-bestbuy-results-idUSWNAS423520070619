 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Best Buy Co. Inc. ( BBY.N ) reported quarterly earnings on Tuesday that missed analyst estimates by a wide margin and gave a disappointing full-year forecast as television sales cooled. 

 The results and a weak earnings forecast sent the shares of the top U.S. consumer electronics retailer down 6 percent. It also cast new doubts on consumer spending trends, weighing on the shares of rivals and the U.S. stock market as a whole. "It appears that the industry had its first significant slowdown in some time," even as Best Buy gained market share, Chief Executive Brad Anderson said in an interview. "We really didn't see that coming." Large flat-screen TVs have been a hot ticket for several years. Best Buy executives said on a conference call that TV sales took an unexpected breather after the U.S. Super Bowl football championships in February, despite a 25 percent decline in prices. Best Buy's bottom line was also hurt as less profitable notebook computers and video game consoles made up a greater percentage of sales, the company said. Economic concerns such as higher fuel prices and a weak housing market played a role as well. Analysts noted that profit margins were pinched by markdowns of older TV models and sales of related services. "Results last year and in this quarter point to much more rapid deterioration in gross margin than they or we anticipated," said Credit Suisse analyst Gary Balter in a note. "Management needs to convince the Street that margins can be sustained." Best Buy, whose rivals include Circuit City Stores Inc. CC.N and RadioShack Corp. ( RSH.N ), said net income fell to $192 million, or 39 cents a share, for the first quarter that ended June 2, from $234 million, or 47 cents per share, a year ago. Analysts on average were expecting profit of 50 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. This was Best Buy's second earnings miss in the past three quarters and by far the widest in terms of percentage in nearly three years. Revenue rose to $7.93 billion from $6.96 billion, beating analysts' targets of $7.83 billion. "The margin numbers were terrible and we've known from the data we've seen that consumer spending has moderated," said Peter Boockvar, equity strategist at Miller Tabak & Co. DEMAND SEEN IMPROVING IN SECOND HALF Best Buy forecast fiscal-year earnings of $2.95 to $3.15 per share, short of the analysts' average view of $3.16. The company expects demand, and profits, to gain steam later this year, fueled by mobile phones, music players and high-definition TVs. "We expect the same trend we saw in the first quarter is likely to sustain through the summer, with strong gaming sales offset with some weakness in the home theater business," Anderson said. Economic concerns also played a role, executives said. "We believe it's a timing issue -- no relief with the price of gas and many other factors that give our customers cause for real concern right now," said Chief Operating Officer Brian Dunn during a conference call. Electronics retailers have come under pressure as mass chains such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) compete more aggressively. Circuit City is closing stores and cutting headquarters jobs to boost results, and just last week, Tweeter Home Entertainment Group Inc. TWTR.O filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors. "We're finding the marketplace competitively more difficult," Anderson said. "Other retailers with fewer options are being even more impacted." Minneapolis-based Best Buy said a 14 percent revenue rise in the quarter reflected a net addition of 230 new stores in the past year and a comparable-store sales gain of 3 percent. The average size of customer transactions also increased as the chain has seen a shift toward higher-ticket items. The company's stock closed down $2.83 to $45.18 on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock is down roughly 8 percent for the year compared with a nearly 8 percent rise for Standard & Poor's 500  .SPX . The shares in Circuit City, which is due to report results on Wednesday, dropped about 3 percent to close at $16.07. RadioShack also fell about 3 percent, to $33.71.
