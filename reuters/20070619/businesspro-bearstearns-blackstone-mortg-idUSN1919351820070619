 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bear Stearns Cos. BSC.N has offered 
to infuse $1.5 billion of its own capital to help rescue a Bear 
Stearns hedge fund on the brink of collapse, people familiar 
with the situation said on Tuesday. 

  Negotiations to rescue the fund are continuing, and the 
situation is still fluid, a person familiar with the matter 
said.  The fund would pledge collateral against the $1.5 billion 
from Bear Stearns, sources said.  The struggling Bear Stearns High-Grade Structured Credit 
Strategies Enhanced Leverage Fund suffered 23 percent losses 
through April, amid money-losing investments in subprime 
mortgages, and faced demands from creditors to post additional 
collateral.  Late last week, the fund sold off at least $4 billion of 
mortgage securities, to help pay for client redemptions and 
expected margin calls.  Soon after that, Merrill Lynch MER.N seized some $400 
million of the funds' assets, and planned to sell them off, 
according to news reports.  But instead, creditors including Merrill, Citigroup ( C.N ), 
and JPMorgan Chase ( JPM.N ) agreed to discuss a reorganization 
for the fund.  On Tuesday, Blackstone Group presented creditors with a 
plan to keep the fund going, including a capital infusion and a 
year-long freeze on collateral calls.  Blackstone BG.UL, the private-equity investment giant 
that is also an active restructuring adviser, Merrill, and 
JPMorgan declined to comment. Representatives of Citigroup and 
Bear Stearns did not return calls seeking comment.  Bear Stearns has about $40 million of exposure to the fund, 
and executives last week said the fund's struggles would not 
affect its earnings.  (Reporting by  Walden Siew ,  Joseph Giannone ,  Dan Wilchins )
