 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A U.S. judge ruled on Tuesday that the patent on Plavix, a multibillion-dollar drug that prevents blood clots, is valid, handing a major victory to Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. ( BMY.N ) and Sanofi-Aventis ( SASY.PA ). 

 The ruling revived debate on Wall Street about a takeover of Bristol-Myers.  The following is reaction from industry analysts and investors: LES FUNTLEYDER, HEALTH CARE ANALYST, MILLER TABAK "Most people had assumed that they would win, but it's nice to have the overhang removed. "I'm not so sure that Bristol wants to be acquired... Given that they've signed (product) deals with AstraZeneca and Pfizer, it kind of suggests that maybe they don't want to be." "Their pipeline is getting much, much better, so they may feel confident enough to do it on their own, to remain an independent entity." VIREN MEHTA, A PRINCIPAL AT MEHTA PARTNERS. "The 10 percent risk that Sanofi and Bristol might have lost this case has now dried to dust, and now strengthens the opportunity for management at Bristol to reassess an independent future." He said Bristol is in the "top quartile" of U.S. drugmakers in terms of new products being launched, although sales of those products will hinge on the company's marketing skill. He said those new drugs, and ones waiting in the wings, could help the company remain independent but could also be a lure to potential suitors. JASON FOX, H&R BLOCK FINANCIAL ADVISORS "The decision will help solidify Bristol-Myers' earnings and dividend, and perhaps open the door for another drugmaker -- most logically Sanofi -- to come in at this point and purchase Bristol." The Zimulti setback "could push Sanofi's hand to do something on the mergers and acquisition front, in order to get new products and bigger geographic reach." Last week a U.S. health panel rejected Zimulti, an experimental Sanofi obesity drug. JAMI RUBIN, ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY "While broadly anticipated, we see this outcome as highly positive for Bristol-Myers as it removes a theoretical cloud over the stock. The news opens the door to a takeout, which has been widely discussed in the press (including the London Times), although late-stage product deals with AstraZeneca and Pfizer could complicate this, in our opinion. (Bristol-Myers has not commented on the various press reports.) "Bristol-Myers is the most expensive equity in the large-cap group, already reflecting expectations of a deal ($2-$3 of takeout premium). While our fundamental fair value remains at $30, we see a potential takeout price in the mid 30s  ... " PAUL DIGGLE, ANALYST AT NOMURA CODE SECURITIES IN LONDON: He thinks Sanofi will now bid for Bristol-Myers, although CEO Gerard Le Fur is less keen on such a move than Chairman and former CEO Jean-Francois Dehecq. "I think Dehecq wants Bristol on board and Le Fur doesn't. But Le Fur's argument for not bidding is that he has a world-class pipeline -- well, for the third-biggest drug company in the world, it is not world class anymore." BEN YEOH, ANALYST AT DRESDNER KLEINWORT IN LONDON: "I don't think (Sanofi buying Bristol) makes that much sense in terms of creating value for Sanofi because they can't do it all with cash. But it is very difficult to second guess Sanofi management." MARK PURCELL, INDUSTRY ANALYST AT DEUTSCHE BANK IN LONDON: "There is more pressure for them (Sanofi) to do something strategically, but obviously the Bristol-Myers share price has moved up a lot. At this stage, if Sanofi could stomach it, a higher number of smaller deals would probably be more beneficial to the company than one large deal -- but it is the obvious thing that people will speculate about. There were signs that the board approved the idea of a deal (earlier this year), whereas Gerard Le Fur did not. He was the champion of Acomplia, which has now fallen apart, so I think you will see increased speculation that they will do something."
