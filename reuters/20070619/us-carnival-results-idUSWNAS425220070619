 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Carnival Corp. & Plc ( CCL.N ) ( CCL.L ), the world's largest cruise operator, posted slightly higher quarterly profit on Tuesday as growth in Europe more than offset weakness in the Caribbean. 

 Carnival, which operates the Holland America, Cunard and Princess cruise lines as well as its namesake line, said net profit rose to $390 million, or 48 cents per share, in the fiscal second quarter ended May 31, from $380 million, or 46 cents per share, a year earlier. Wall Street analysts had expected Miami-based Carnival to earn 47 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 9 percent to $2.9 billion despite price pressures in Caribbean operations. Carnival has been expanding in the growing European cruise market as business in the Caribbean, the industry's top market, suffers from overcapacity and tepid demand following extensive hurricane damage in recent years. Carnival said its fiscal second-half bookings and pricing are showing gains from a year earlier. "It does appear that the pricing picture is improving," Chief Operating Officer Howard Frank said on a conference call with analysts. Robert LaFleur, an analyst at Susquehanna Financial Group, said in a research note that Carnival remains vulnerable to economic instability. "An economic slowdown could hurt consumer spending, which could further pressure cruise pricing and have a negative impact on earnings estimates and investor sentiment," he said. Carnival said it had cut its fiscal 2007 earnings forecast by 12 cents a share because of high fuel prices. It now expects to earn $2.85 to $2.95 per share. It forecast fiscal third-quarter earnings of $1.60 to $1.62 per share. LaFleur said the guidance was a "neutral factor" on the stock. Carnival warned in March that high fuel costs might hurt its earnings this year. Analysts' average earnings forecasts are $1.66 per share for the third quarter and $3 per share for the year. Carnival shares, which have risen 9 percent over the last three months, were up 28 cents to $49.94 near midday on the New York Stock Exchange.
