 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Retailer Best Buy Co. Inc. ( BBY.N ) said on Tuesday it is still optimistic about the market for consumer electronics, partly blaming a shortfall in quarterly profit on a drop in flat-panel television sales. 

 Best Buy, the top U.S. consumer electronics retailer, said TV sales slowed dramatically during its fiscal first quarter, ended June 2. The company explained it as a temporary pause after consumers snapped up TVs ahead of the U.S. Super Bowl championship football game in February. "Despite what we believe to be the first industrywide interruption in six years, we have never been more optimistic about our future growth opportunities," Chief Operating Officer Brian Dunn said during a conference call with analysts. "Does this (interruption) mean that people are changing their minds, turning away from technology and entertainment products and solutions? We don't think so," he said. "They simply hit the pause button."
