 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Investors in Yahoo Inc. ( YHOO.O ) abandoned on Tuesday their initial excitement over a management switch at the Internet media company, sending its shares lower on expectations that little real change was in the works. 

 Yahoo shares dropped 1.5 percent on Tuesday, partly retracing gains of more than 6 percent in extended trading on Monday after the company said co-founder Jerry Yang would take over the chief executive role from Terry Semel. Some shareholders had bet that Yang's taking the helm signaled more drastic changes, such as extensive partnerships with technology and media players, or even a potential merger. But that speculation cooled after Yang himself pledged a commitment to keeping Yahoo a "vibrant independent company." "We believe this announcement implies that the near-term probability of a sale of the company is low," wrote Goldman Sachs analyst Anthony Noto in a note on Tuesday. If Yahoo had truly been close to doing a deal, it probably would not have replaced Semel and would have weathered growing criticism of performance that has fallen behind that of Web search rival Google Inc.( GOOG.O ), Noto said. Analysts also pointed to Yahoo's warning that its display advertising sales are slowing as the latest sign that the company is still wrestling with its financial performance. But with intensifying competition from Google, Yahoo needs to make a move soon to shore up its business model, they said. "We believe Yahoo will consider partnerships with Comcast (Corp. ( CMCSA.O )), AT&T (Inc. ( T.N )), (Time Warner Inc. ( TWX.N ) unit) AOL, NewsCorp/MySpace, and Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT.O ))," RBC Capital Markets analyst Jordan Rohan wrote in a note to clients. Speculation surrounding Yahoo's future has included the idea that it might give Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. NWSa.N a stake in the company in return for the popular MySpace social network. "We believe an acquisition of Facebook would also be interesting, although a more likely acquirer of Facebook may be Microsoft," Rohan added. Facebook.com is a main rival to MySpace. Semel is taking the role of nonexecutive chairman at Yahoo, while Susan Decker, the company's former chief financial officer, was named president to oversee the company's key advertising and media business operations. Yahoo shares dipped by 43 cents to $27.69 on the Nasdaq.
