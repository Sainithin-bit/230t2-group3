 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Sales of previously owned U.S. homes fell at the fastest pace on record in December, though prices rose for the first time since the credit crisis began in August 2007. 

 KEY POINTS: * The National Association of Realtors said existing home sales fell 16.7 percent to an annual rate of 5.45 million units in December, a sharper decline than the 5.90 million unit pace expected. * For the entire year, sales rose 4.9 percent in 2009 to 5.156 million units, while prices fell from 2008 by 12.4 percent. COMMENTS: DAVID DIETZE, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, POINT VIEW FINANCIAL SERVICES, SUMMIT, NEW JERSEY "It was ugly. The question for investors is, does this suggest we are on the precipice of perhaps a double dip, at least in so far as real estate is concerned? This was the epicenter of the downturn, residential real estate, and this suggests that all is not well despite very low mortgage rates. "On the other hand, we have to look at the role of the government and they had enacted a cash-for-cul-de-sacs type program which gave first-time home buyers a generous credit against their taxes. "The first wave of that program ended or was thought to end permanently come November 30 and so some trade groups are suggesting that that downturn was not due to fundamentals in that market but rather the effect of that popular tax credit expiring. "Are there any kind of glimmers of hope? One I think was the fact that although there were fewer sales than expected they were bringing a larger price per home sold than a year earlier." MARC PADO, U.S. MARKET STRATEGIST, CANTOR FITZGERALD & CO., SAN FRANCISCO: "This big of a decline is a little bit of a disappointment. I think 2010 is still going to be a tough year for housing." STUART HOFFMAN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, PITTSBURGH: "We had a surprising surge in November, capturing what at the time was an expiring first-time home buyer credit. In November you had a very busy month for mortgage brokers and other lenders, conference rooms were quite busy with closings, and then December comes along. The tax credit has been extended and expanded subsequent to that, so maybe that's why the collapse wasn't even greater. "Also there was pretty darn cold weather across the country to make it that much less hospitable to go looking for a home even though the credit was extended. "You have to take the two months together, you come out with a number that is right around 6 million and that's still a good solid pace of home sales and that's probably more the underlying trend. "It's still a very weak market, and still a lot of foreclosures, but in terms of home sales I think we're likely to see continued improvement over the first half of this year. I would not be surprised if in the spring quarter you saw a pretty good surge in home sales ... for the full year I have existing home sales up by better than 10 percent." TOM PORCELLI, SENIOR ECONOMIST AT RBC CAPITAL MARKETS IN NEW YORK: "Obviously worse than expected." "The key factors are that the home buyer tax credit was extended, so that pulled activity forward and so we are seeing a let-down. People were trying to get in ahead of the end of the program, but that since been extended. "In general, there are so many headwinds that the housing market has to deal with. First, the tax credit is going to expire in the next few months, then you will have rising mortgage rates as the Fed ends its MBS repurchases. "Yields are down a bit here in reaction, but there  is so much going on the week to whip the market back. First, the Fed meeting, second the uncertainty around Bernanke, and third the GDP number." PETER BOOCKVAR, EQUITY STRATEGIST, MILLER TABAK + CO, NEW YORK "In a clear hangover from the buying-induced jump in the summer and fall due to the home buying tax credit, December existing home sales totaled below forecasts as both single family and condos/co-ops saw declines from November. Through the artificial suppression of mortgage rates and the home buying tax credit, the industry has lifted off the mat but we're left with the distortions where the true equilibrium between supply and demand won't be realized until the summer when both have run its course." BEN HERZON, ECONOMIST, MACROECONOMIC ADVISERS, ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI: "The data was absolutely much worse than we had expected and is a testament to just how important the first-time home buyers tax credit is for boosting sales. There was a flurry of sales activity leading up to the original expiration at the end of November and so December sales fell off a cliff. This is an unwind of activity, but not much of a surprise since it was hinted at from pending home sales data and we therefore knew a drop was coming. The level of decline was much lower, however. The best way to get a feel for the market is to take the two months of November and December and average them. We will probably see a boost in sales activity this spring, but probably not as strong as this past fall." RICHARD SPARKS, SENIOR EQUITIES ANALYST, SCHAEFFER'S INVESTMENT RESEARCH, CINCINNATI, OHIO: "The initial reaction looks like some of the housing stocks dipped a little bit on the news, but they've really popped back up to where they were before the news came out. Even though the number came in a little bit less than expected, it doesn't seem that it has had much of a negative impact here in the first few minutes. The market's pretty strong this morning, you've got some resiliency built into stocks." PIERRE ELLIS, SENIOR ECONOMISTS, DECISION ECONOMICS, NEW YORK: "The drop in home sales is the payback for the acceleration of sales that occurred with the original first-time home buyers tax credit. But the drop is more than economists looked for so there is an issue as to whether the decline represents a fundamental weakening. It will take a few months to know for sure. There may be some underlying new weakness in housing demand that is being exacerbated by the payback factor from the expiration of that first tax credit program. "The most important number is the pending home sales index coming up [next week] which will tell what demand looked like in the aftermath of the first expiration of the tax credit. Pending home sales is the initiation of purchase transactions. It leads closings by a month or two. The drop in existing home sales is close to what the drop in pending home sales showed in November. December numbers for existing and new home sales will probably be below-trend and will probably climb back toward the trend at a very moderate pace." ZACH PANDL, ECONOMIST, NOMURA SECURITIES, NEW YORK "Housing data is showing the after-effects of the first time homebuyers' tax credit. This one-time tax credit appears to have caused a surge in home sales. Now we've passed the scheduled expiration of that program, sales seem to be falling off. How much are prices going to be weakened now that this government stimulus has faded away? "If you're shopping for homes, the decision takes a while. People that were shopping for homes this summer did not know that the program was going to be extended. It caused a big surge in sales. We think that even though the tax credit was extended it will be much less potent this time around because the pool of available buyers is smaller. "We're going to have some choppiness in the housing data, but fundamentally affordability has improved. We think activity has bottomed out. "For the market this is negative data. It suggests that one-time government measures were more important in boosting data than most people thought." CHARLES LIEBERMAN, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, ADVISORS CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, PARAMUS, NEW JERSEY: "The data was adversely affected by bad weather, and doesn't provide much information about underlying trends. It doesn't concern me at all, and I don't think it will be a big impact on trading. The market upside we're seeing today is because of Bernanke, since it now appears that Washingtonians think he will be reconfirmed, removing a big source of uncertainty for investors." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stock indexes briefly dipped, then recovered. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices were little changed. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar fell slightly against the euro.
