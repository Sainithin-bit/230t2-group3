 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc is capping pay for partners in the UK at $1.6 million, according to a source familiar with the matter. 

 Goldman has been at the forefront of the debate over pay because of its quick return to large profits soon after taxpayer bailouts. The company last week announced it would pay about $16 billion to its employees for 2009. The source was anonymous because pay is an internal matter.
