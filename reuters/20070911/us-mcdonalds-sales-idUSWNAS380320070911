 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - McDonald's Corp. ( MCD.N ) on Tuesday reported an 8.1 percent increase in August sales at restaurants open at least thirteen months, helped by new food offerings in the United States and strong demand in Japan, Australia and China. 

 The world's biggest restaurant company said same-store sales, a key retail measure, rose 7.4 percent in the United States, citing the ongoing strength of its breakfast business, beverages and new food offerings. In Europe, special summertime menu items helped push sales up 6.1 percent. Same-store sales rose 12.4 percent in an area that includes Africa, the Middle East and Asia/Pacific regions, the company said, due to strong sales in Japan, Australia and China that benefited from extended hours and breakfast items. McDonald's shares rose 2.1 percent to $51.20 in premarket trading. ( here  for "Shop Talk" -- Reuters' retail and consumer blog) (Reporting by  Martinne Geller )
