 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Nasdaq Stock Market ( NDAQ.O ) said on Tuesday its matched market share of stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange rose to 19.3 percent in August from 12.5 percent a year before. 

 Matched market share represents stock trades executed on Nasdaq's systems and excludes those routed to other market centers. Its matched market share of all U.S. equity share volume was 30.4 percent in August. Its matched market share in securities listed on its own exchange was 48.4 percent in August, a slight drop from 48.8 percent the previous year. Nasdaq's matched volume in all U.S. stocks increased to 51.8 billion shares from 27.5 billion a year ago. Nasdaq's handled market share of Nasdaq-listed stocks was 75.1 percent in August, compared with 83.1 percent the previous year. Its handled market share has fallen steadily since the beginning of 2007. (Reporting by  Anupreeta Das )
