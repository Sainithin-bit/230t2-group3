 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co ( 7201.T ) will decide whether to develop a $3,000 car next year, at which time it expects to have an Indian partner for the project, a top executive at the Japanese automaker said on Tuesday. 

 "We're now in the period of trying to summarize and framework our understanding of market needs for a $3,000 car," Executive Vice President Carlos Tavares told Reuters in an interview at the Frankfurt International Motor Show. "I would say a decision would be made next year," he said, adding it was premature to say when the car, if pursued, would be ready. Japan's third-biggest automaker, controlled by Renault SA ( RENA.PA ), has said it may try to build a $3,000 car to compete with the "one-lakh", or 100,000-rupee ($2,500) car planned for India by local carmaker Tata Motors Ltd ( TAMO.BO ). Renault recently began talks with Indian motorcycle maker Bajaj Auto Ltd ( BJAT.BO ) on a possible project for such a car, but Nissan's involvement has not been made evident. Tavares said it would probably make sense to join with its French partner, but said Nissan was also exploring other options. In addition to a $3,000 car, Tavares said Nissan had a project to develop a family of entry-level cars benchmarked in price against Renault's popular, low-cost Logan model. A timeframe has not been set, but Nissan was "serious" about entering the segment, not just to win in emerging markets but also in mature ones, he said. "We have a specific entry-level car strategy," Tavares said, noting that Nissan would aim to best its French partner's runaway success with the 5,000-euro ($6,900) Logan. The family of cars would not necessarily share a platform with Renault's no-frills model, but would try to share as many components as it can with Renault to save costs, Tavares said. Sourcing would be from multiple emerging markets, including India, which Nissan has identified as a strategic supply source for cheap but quality components. Nissan this year began selling a Nissan-badged Logan in Mexico under the name Aprio, but Tavares said that was an exception. "I don't think we will expand this to other markets. We will bring our own specific car for the entry-level segment for other markets," he said.
