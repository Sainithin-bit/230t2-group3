 TAIPEI  (Reuters) - AIG's ( AIG.N ) private banking unit is aiming to take 10 percent of Taiwan's wealth management market within five years, targeting residents who have made big money in China, a top executive said on Tuesday. 

 AIG, the world's biggest insurer, also expects its newly launched Taiwan wealth management business to reach the break-even mark by the end of next year, Peter Wild, chief executive of AIG Private Bank, told reporters at a launch event. "The aim of market share should be getting into 10 percent over the next five years," said Wild, a Swiss native. "Taiwan is a very flourishing economy. You have major investments in China." The rush by AIG and others into Taiwan's wealth management market -- which includes large numbers of executives who made their fortunes manufacturing in China -- mirrors a larger global move into the sector by many top financial institutions. HSBC ( 0005.HK )( HSBA.L ) said earlier this month it planned to make wealth management one of its top priorities in Taiwan, aiming for a 6 to 7 percent market share in three years, as it hoped to tap strong demand in Asia's third-largest wealth management services market behind Japan and China. Other players in the Taiwan market include UBS ( UBS.N ) ( UBSN.VX ), which aims to boost its share of Taiwan's wealth management market to 10 percent by 2015 from about 1 percent now. "AIG Private Bank is being very aggressive in Taiwan, meaning the market's potential is pretty solid," said Dennis Chen, head of UBS wealth management in Taiwan. EXPANSION IN ASIA AIG Private Bank's Taiwan unit is its fourth in Asia as the group expands beyond its core insurance business into wealth management, where margins in Asia are higher than those in Europe. "We are applying for a branch license in Singapore.... We are dedicated to bring services to the China market.... We have business plans in India," said Wild. "Asian investors are more aggressive than European investors," he added. AIG has a private bank license in Hong Kong and representative offices in Singapore and Shanghai. AIG told Reuters in May that it was aiming for US$20 billion in assets in five years at its new unit in Taiwan. The company hoped to build its business by signing up the 9,000 to 10,000 high-net-worth clients with investable assets of US$2 million that its insurance operation now serves. The operation -- Nan Shan Life Insurance Co -- is one of Taiwan's top three players in the sector, competing with Cathay Financial ( 2882.TW ) and Shin Kong Financial ( 2888.TW ). Citigroup ( C.N ) is also active in Taiwan's wealth management market, as well as local player Chinatrust Financial ( 2891.TW ), which is aiming to boost fee income from its wealth management business 20 percent this year to more than T$10 billion ($302 million).
