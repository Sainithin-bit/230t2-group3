 DALIAN, China  (Reuters) - An economic recession in the United States could shave up to 2.5 percentage points off China's rate of growth, but that might not be such a bad thing, said Stephen Roach, Morgan Stanley's Asia Chairman. 

 The recent turmoil in global financial markets has prompted concern that if the downturn in U.S. housing spreads to consumers and saps demand for Chinese goods, the Chinese economy could suffer with global implications. Roach said that Chinese exports, which make up about 40 percent of gross domestic product, could indeed be hit by a U.S. slowdown, but that the economic impact would not be severe. "That's clearly a point of vulnerability, but I think we're talking about a haircut of maybe two (percentage) points off the growth rate on a worst-case basis -- two, two-and-a-half points," he told Reuters in an interview. "China is probably growing much too fast right now anyway. This would be in many respects a helpful cooling," he added on the sidelines of World Economic Forum meeting over the weekend. China has seen its economy grow by at least 10 percent for four years in a row, and policy-makers have repeatedly warned about the need to keep it from overheating and rebalance growth to rely more on household consumption and less on exports. Output in the second quarter expanded by 11.9 percent from a year earlier, prompting measures by China's central bank, including raising both interest rates and banks' required reserves. Roach said that while the economy was in "terrific shape," more steps would need to be taken to rebalance it. "I think the results so far have been somewhat disappointing, but I think the policies are headed in the right direction," he said. While China would probably be able to weather a downturn in U.S. demand, Roach said that other areas could be harder hit. "I think the bigger risk comes to other countries, whether they're in Asia, through a China-centric supply chain, or even in slower-growing regions like Europe that don't have the cushion to get hit by a slowdown in their major external market," he said. ASSET BUBBLES Another concern for Beijing might be that if the United States goes into recession, the resulting rise in unemployment could intensify U.S. trade protectionism, leading to a worsening of the political environment on U.S.-China trade, Roach said. Beijing faces pressure from critics in Washington to let its yuan  CNY=CFXS  currency appreciate more quickly to end what they call an unfair trade advantage. A recent series of food and product safety scandals has only heightened such scrutiny. Roach said that as a developing economy with a relatively undeveloped financial system, gradual currency appreciation was a "perfectly reasonable" strategy. Beijing would probably need to do more, however, to address the rapid rise in the domestic stock market, Roach said. Many fear the market, which has nearly doubled so far this year as retail investors have moved en masse to shift their savings into equities, is developing a bubble. "I'd say that there are excesses in the Chinese stock market. I think currently the government has concluded that the market has probably run too fast, too far," he said. Roach said that a recently announced initiative for allowing Chinese individuals to invest directly in Hong Kong stocks was a significant development in Beijing's efforts to keep a lid on destabilizing capital inflows. Some media reports have suggested that the scheme, announced last month, may have backtracked recently, and some analysts have cited concerns that if the flood gates are opened too widely, it could have harmful consequences for domestic shares. But Roach said he thought Beijing would press ahead with more such moves to encourage capital outflows in the coming months, as other attempts to cool the A-share market, including raising the stamp tax, had proven unsuccessful. "The government knows that by allowing some controlled capital outflows it can create a venting mechanism to deal with this liquidity build-up problem," he said. "The government is not trying to pop a bubble. The government would like a more stable market climate. So I think that's the goal, but they recognize that there are obviously some two-way risks to these markets the higher it goes," Roach said.
