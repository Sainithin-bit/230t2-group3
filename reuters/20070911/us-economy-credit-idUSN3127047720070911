 LONDON  (Reuters) - Major banks are set to remain sound despite credit losses from the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis, European Central Bank chief Jean-Claude Trichet said on Tuesday as investors awaited a speech from his U.S. counterpart, Ben Bernanke. 

 "It is important to remark that credit losses were not significant enough to materially impact the soundness of core financial institutions," Trichet told a European Parliament Committee. He added the Eurosystem of euro zone central banks had shown its capacity to react quickly and effectively to the challenges it had faced since the beginning of August when the crisis first surfaced. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke will deliver the fourth Bundesbank lecture on "Global Imbalances: Recent Development and their Implications", in Berlin at 1500 GMT. The European Commission forecast euro zone growth was likely to slow more than previously expected this year, partly as a result of recent market turmoil, and could suffer a bigger deceleration in 2008. But it foresaw no sharp slowdown. "The economies should ... be in a relatively good position to weather the turbulence, at least if the disruption remains short-lived," the Commission said. German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck was upbeat, though his country has been the worst hit in Europe by credit upheaval, stemming from mass defaults in the U.S. mortgage market for borrowers with poor credit histories. "The German financial market has sufficient reserves to weather the current tensions," Steinbrueck told parliament, adding there were no signs of the economic outlook darkening. In a similar vein, British finance minister Alistair Darling told his cabinet colleagues the UK economy was in good shape and should be able to withstand financial market ructions. The Bank of Japan, meanwhile, said problems in the U.S. home loan sector were unlikely to unsettle Japan's financial system. The ECB drained 60 billion euros ($83 billion) of excess liquidity from the interbank overnight market. It had added record liquidity over the past month to ease a credit squeeze caused by banks' reluctance to lend to each other because of uncertainty about who is exposure to U.S. subprime mortgage defaults. The ECB later announced an extra tender for three-month bank refinancing, confirming a statement by Trichet last week. Money markets remained tight. London interbank offered rates for overnight euros rose sharply from Monday levels after the ECB action, while three-month sterling rates hit their highest in nearly nine years, showing just how scarce ready cash remains in that area. MIXED MESSAGES The Fed is widely expected to cut rates at its September 18 meeting with many analysts arguing a shock drop in job creation in August, the first in four years, justified a half-point move. But Fed officials struck differing tones on Monday about the depth of the crisis facing the U.S. economy.  "The market is waiting for the next signal. It could come from Bernanke, but I doubt he is likely to offer any great insight into what the Fed is going to do next week," said Laura Ambroseno, currency strategist at Morgan Stanley in London. The National Association of Realtors trimmed its forecast for U.S. existing home sales in 2007 to 5.92 million units from 6.04 million and said the median price will probably fall 2.2 percent this year. Ratings agencies said nearly $100 billion of loans had been hit by the credit crisis but European companies were in sound enough shape to ride the unrest. Forty-nine high-yield loan and bond deals worth 70 billion euros ($96.5 billion) have been affected since mid-June, Standard & Poor's said. The deals have either been cancelled, put on hold, reduced in size, or had their pricing or structure changed, the agency said in a report. Moody's Investors Service said European companies' mostly solid balance sheets should help them withstand the upheaval but "junk" bond defaults would rise due to higher borrowing costs. "European issuers are still generally in solid financial shape, helping to damp down fears of a repeat of the corporate credit quality crisis of the early 2000s," the agency said. The upcoming third-quarter results season will show how companies have fared and, in particular, how much banks will be forced to write off. (Additional writing by Gerrard Raven)
