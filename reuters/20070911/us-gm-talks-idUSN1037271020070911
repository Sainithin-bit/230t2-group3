 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) in its contract negotiations with the United Auto Workers union has proposed one option that excludes establishing a union-run healthcare trust but calls for deeper cuts in several areas, the Wall Street Journal reported in its online edition. 

 That option is one of two proposals GM has put on the table, with the other being establishing such a healthcare trust, which would be funded by GM cash, debt and possibly stock, the Journal reported, citing people familiar with the proposals. GM was not immediately available for comment. GM and Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) have proposed establishing a trust fund for healthcare costs that would be administered by the UAW as part of ongoing contract negotiations, people familiar with the matter said last month. Negotiations on a new labor deal could go past the Friday expiration of the current contract, a person familiar with the talks said on Monday.
