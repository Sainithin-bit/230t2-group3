 By  Martha Graybow NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Biovail Corp BVF.TO said on Monday it has agreed to drop a former Banc of America Securities analyst from a group of nearly two dozen parties the drugmaker is accusing of conspiring to drive down its stock price. Canada's biggest publicly traded drugmaker said it will drop analyst David Maris unit from the racketeering case filed in New Jersey state court last year. Biovail said in a statement that along with the settlement with Maris, it also had settled with Banc of America Securities regarding related legal matters pending in federal court in Manhattan. The Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) unit was not named as a defendant in the New Jersey state court case. A federal judge in Manhattan had ruled earlier this year that Biovail violated a protective order in a shareholder lawsuit in New York by using documents obtained from Banc of America Securities to bring the New Jersey case. A Bank of America spokesman, Scott Silvestri, said the bank does not comment on pending litigation. The news was first reported in Monday's editions of the New York Post. The report said that Biovail had also agreed to pay Banc of America Securities $2 million in legal fees, citing a person familiar with the proceedings. In its lawsuit, Biovail contended that its share price was sabotaged by hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors, research firm Gradient Analysts and other analysts who it said conspired to produce unflattering reports. The lawsuit sought $4.6 billion in damages. Banc of America Securities was named separately in a shareholder lawsuit in New Jersey, also filed last year, contending that it and other parties issued biased reports to drive down Biovail stock. The bank decided to end its research coverage of Biovail soon after the shareholder lawsuit was filed, saying it needed to focus on its defense of the litigation. Biovail has been hounded by concerns about its financial bookkeeping since the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission launched an inquiry into its accounting in 2003. The investigation surrounds a company warning of a revenue shortfall in the third quarter of 2003, an October 2003 truck accident involving the company's Wellbutrin antidepressant and its disclosure of the accident's impact on 2003 earnings. The company is also being investigated by federal prosecutors about similar matters. (Additional reporting by Scott Anderson in Toronto and  Lewis Krauskopf  in New York)
