 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Former bond trader Orlando Joseph Jett, who was accused of creating false profits to hide losses, has been ordered by a court to pay $8.41 million, the Securities and Exchange Commission said on Tuesday. 

 The Southern District Court of New York entered a judgment last Friday enforcing the SEC's 2004 order that Jett repay $8.21 million and pay a $200,000 civil penalty. The case dates back to the late 1990s when a federal administrative judge ordered the former Kidder Peabody bond trader to repay the millions in bonuses he received as a result of his fraudulent transactions on top of a civil penalty. The SEC had found that Jett exploited an anomaly in Kidder's automated trading records system to book nonexistent profits of about $264 million when his activities caused the firm to lose $75 million. The scandal eventually led to the sale of the firm. Jett appealed the decision, arguing that he had maintained proper books and record-keeping in the way he recorded profits on government bond deals into the firm's computers. The SEC then brought an action in 2006 to enforce its order against Jett. (Reporting by  Rachelle Younglai )
