 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Co ( 7203.T ) President Katsuaki Watanabe said on Tuesday he expected a slight decline in the U.S. auto market in 2007 to around 16.3 million units. 

 Speaking at the Frankfurt International Motor Show, Watanabe said he expected Toyota to maintain its position in the market. "In that context we want to achieve a sales level that is by no means inferior to the market's and in that regard I think we are on track," he told Reuters, adding Toyota continued its U.S. expansion plans. He said the construction of Toyota plants in North America on schedule and believed U.S. economic fundamentals remained strong.
