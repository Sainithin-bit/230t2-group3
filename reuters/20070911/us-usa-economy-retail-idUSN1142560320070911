 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Chain store sales rose more than expected last week mainly due to back-to-school shopping, in a sign that consumers continue to spend despite a weaker economy, two reports showed on Tuesday. 

 Redbook Research said its retail sales index was up 2.8 percent in the week ended September 8 versus a year ago, while month-to-date retail sales also rose 2.8 percent in September, compared with target growth of 2.6 percent. In a separate report, the International Council of Shopping Centers and UBS Securities said weekly retail chain store sales rose 0.3 percent in the week ended September 8, compared with the prior week, and year-over-year sales were up 2.9 percent. ICSC expects year-over-year growth of 2.5 percent for September. "Once again we're seeing a very important point being made by consumers here," said David Kelly, economic adviser at Boston-based Putnam Investments. "No matter how gloomy they feel about the state of the economy, they are not going to stop spending because of it. Businesses may react to consumer confidence, but consumers don't." Michael P. Niemira, chief economist for ICSC, said the August sales momentum continued into September. "Despite the more negative economic picture painted by the August decline in employment, consumers continued to spend at a moderate pace," he added. The Labor Department said on Friday that U.S. nonfarm employment fell by 4,000 in August, the first decline in four years. Despite healthy numbers in same-store sales, expectations for an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve stayed high. "It does affect in a small way the language they will use, but I think the Federal Reserve will still cut rates in a week," Kelly said. The Federal Reserve's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee is scheduled to meet on September 18. Confidence in the state of U.S. consumer spending was supported by a report from McDonald's Corp. ( MCD.N ) on Tuesday, as the world's biggest restaurant company said same-store sales rose 7.4 percent in the United States in August. Tuesday's numbers came before the broader U.S. government retail sales measure for August, due out on Friday. Economists in a Reuters survey expect a growth of 0.40 percent, compared with a July increase on 0.30 percent. (Additional reporting by  Martinne Geller )
