 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Dubai World will take a 25 percent stake in a planned multibillion-dollar resort on the Las Vegas Strip led by MGM Mirage Inc ( MGM.N ), marking the state-owned investment firm's latest foray in the U.S. gambling haven. 

 Under an agreement with MGM Mirage and Kerzner International Holdings Ltd, Dubai World unit Istithmar will provide cash equity for the new project, casino operator MGM Mirage said on Tuesday. In August, Dubai World said it planned to invest up to $5.2 billion in MGM Mirage by buying a 9.5 percent stake and half of the casino company's CityCenter development in Las Vegas. "The Las Vegas market is one which we firmly believe will continue to expand," Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem, Dubai World's chairman, said in a release. MGM will own 50 percent of the planned resort, and Kerzner, the developer of the massive Atlantis resort in the Bahamas, will hold the remaining 25 percent. When plans for the project were originally announced in June, MGM and Kerzner were to be 50/50 partners. MGM is contributing about 40 acres of land to the joint venture. The land is valued at $20 million per acre, putting the casino company's contribution at $800 million. Kerzner is leading the planning and conceptualization of the project. The new Las Vegas resort, which has yet to be named, is due to open in 2012. Construction is set to start in 2009, Kerzner said. DUBAI WORLD SEEKS RATING To help the group issue bonds to fund its expansion, Dubai World is seeking a credit rating. "We are in the rating process and preparing documentation," Chief Financial Officer Maryam Sharaf told Reuters on the sidelines of a meeting with bankers in the Gulf commercial hub of Dubai. Sharaf said Dubai World would sell bonds once it had received the rating. The government of Dubai, one of seven emirates that comprise the United Arab Emirates, has also said it is planning a rating as it draws up a financial strategy for the emirate. Dubai World launched a road show on Tuesday in Dubai for a one-year $2.7 billion loan. The facility will be used for general corporate activities, Sharaf said, declining to be more specific. Syndication closes on October 1, with the roadshow now heading to Hong Kong. Dubai World's loan is priced at 85 basis points over the London interbank offered rate for the first six months, and 110 basis points for the rest of the term.
