 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate will vote on Friday on the $789 billion economic stimulus package that President Barack Obama wants quickly to boost the struggling economy, said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. 

 The vote could take a couple of hours to accommodate one Democratic senator who will be attending a funeral out of town, Reid said. Senator Ted Kennedy, who is suffering from brain cancer, was not expected to vote, he said. The House of Representatives also plans to vote on Friday morning and if both chambers pass it, as expected, the package would then go to President Barack Obama for his signature.
