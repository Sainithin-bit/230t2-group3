 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Sirius XM Radio said its XM Satellite has refinanced some of its outstanding debt, but acknowledged it may file for bankruptcy protection as soon as Tuesday. 

 Sirius, the pay-radio provider under pressure to address some $1 billion in debt this year, on Friday said it exchanged $172.5 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due December 2009 for newly issued notes due in June 2011. The company said that it is in talks toward refinancing some of its other debt. A person familiar with the situation told Reuters that both EchoStar Corp and Liberty Media continue intense talks with Sirius XM. An agreement could include a loan to Sirius, or paying off its debt, or assuming the debt obligations. If the talks fail, Sirius -- home to programs by personalities including Howard Stern and Oprah Winfrey as well as Major League Baseball -- may file for bankruptcy. "These transactions may not be successfully consummated," the company said in a statement. "If these transactions are not consummated, it may be forced to file for bankruptcy protection as early as February 17, 2009." (Reporting by  Franklin Paul ; Editing by  Brian Moss )
