 (Reuters) - The $789 billion U.S. economic stimulus package provides $311 billion in appropriations. A further $196 billion is allocated for Medicaid and other social program spending, while $282 billion is devoted to tax cuts. 

 Both the Senate and the House of Representatives are expected to vote on Friday on the package, which President Barack Obama says is essential to boost the U.S. economy out of its recession. Here is a summary of some of the major spending in the package: * $120 billion for infrastructure and science including $27.5 billion for highways, $8.4 billion for public transport and $9.3 billion for Amtrak and high-speed rail. * $7.2 billion to improve access to high-speed Internet in unserved or underserved areas; $4.2 billion for energy efficiency projects at U.S. defense facilities. * $6 billion for local clean water projects. * $6 billion for environmental cleanup of former weapon production and research sites. * Health spending includes $19 billion to encourage doctors and hospitals to upgrade computers and other technology to share patient information. * $1 billion for wellness and prevention programs. * $1.1 billion for studies on the cost effectiveness of various treatments. * $10 billion for biomedical research such as cancer, Alzheimer's and heart disease and to improve facilities at the National Institutes of Health. * Some $21 billion to help workers who lose their jobs maintain employer-provided health insurance through the COBRA program, a federal law that allows workers to temporarily maintain coverage at 102 percent of the cost. The bill provides a 65 percent subsidy for up to nine months. * Some $53.6 billion for a stabilization fund to help cash-strapped states plug holes in their budgets. Most of the money is to be used to avoid education cutbacks and layoffs but a portion is available for school modernization. * $13 billion to help disadvantaged students. * $12.2 billion for the education of disabled children. * Energy spending includes $4.5 billion to increase the energy efficiency of federal buildings. * $11 billion to modernize the electric grid and upgrade technology so customers can instantly see the price of the power they are buying. * $3.4 billion for fossil energy research and development. * $5 billion for weatherization assistance. * $6.3 billion for energy efficiency conservation grants. * $6 billion for loan guarantees for wind and solar projects. * Aid for poor families includes $19.9 billion in additional food stamp assistance. The aid is increased by 13.6 percent. (Compiled by Donna Smith; Editing by  Alan Elsner )
