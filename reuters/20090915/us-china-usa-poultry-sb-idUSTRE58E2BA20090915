 BEIJING  (Reuters) - China has launched an anti-dumping investigation into imports of chicken from the United States after Washington put new tariffs on imported Chinese tires. 

 Following is information about the U.S.-China poultry trade. * The United States is the top chicken importer into China and China is the top export market for U.S. chickens. * Most of the U.S. shipments are wing tips and "paws" -- chicken feet, considered a delicacy in China but garbage in the United States. * In 2008, U.S. shipments totaled 623,884 tonnes, with a value of over $800 million, according to the USA Poultry & Egg Export Council (USAPEEC). In January-July 2009, the volume was 436,544, valued at $376 million, according to the National Chicken Council. * China consumes about 11 million tonnes of chicken a year. Around half is from white feather chickens, mainly bred in northern China, while yellow feather chickens are mainly bred in the south. China imports about 10 percent of its white feather chicken meat and the U.S. is the biggest supplier. * U.S. imports accounted for 73 percent of China's total poultry imports in 2008, rising to 89 percent in the first half of this year, according to the China Animal Agriculture Association (CAAA). * China's slaughter houses are running at only 80 percent of capacity, partly due to alleged U.S. dumping, said Ma Chuang, CAAA deputy secretary general. Ma said that if China's plants ran at full capacity they could meet domestic demand. He said wing tips and paws are more popular than chest meat in China. * USAPEEC says China would not easily be able to replace the imports from domestic poultry suppliers since it would not be economic to increase bird numbers just to supply the market for paws and wing tips. * Exporting chicken feet and wings helps pad profits for U.S. breeders like Tyson Foods Inc. The parts sell for about 40 U.S. cents a pound in China, compared with about 2 U.S. cents/pound in the United States. The CAAA says the U.S. export price represents freight costs only, since the meat is effectively worthless in the United States. USAPEEC says the price difference proves U.S. exporters are not dumping. * Chicken imports into China need two permits: a document from the quarantine office and an "automatic registration form" (ARF), issued twice yearly from the Ministry of Commerce. China has not issued any ARFs for U.S. imports for the second half of this year, putting an obstacle in front of U.S. shipments. USAPEEC says shipments have continued but with higher costs. * In August China said it wanted notification of all new poultry shipments directly from the U.S. Department of Agriculture rather than individual exporters, a change designed to make it harder for smugglers. * China launched a WTO case in April over U.S. legislation that forbids the U.S. government from beginning the process of certifying Chinese cooked poultry exporters. The House of Representatives appropriations bill extends the measure for a fourth year, while the Senate version orders the government to begin the certifying process.
