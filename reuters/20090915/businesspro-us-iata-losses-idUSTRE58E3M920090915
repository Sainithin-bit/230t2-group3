 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The world's airlines are expected to post losses of $11 billion this year, as weak passenger traffic and cargo demand pressures revenue, the International Air Transport Association said on Tuesday. 

 The revised forecast is $2 billion worse than the previous projection for losses of $9 billion due to rising fuel prices and weak yields, the association said in a statement. The Geneva-based airline trade group also forecast that the industry would post losses of $3.8 billion in 2010. (Reporting by  John Crawley  and  Karen Jacobs ; Editing by Maureen Bavdek)
