 CARLSBAD, California  (Reuters) - The United States tried to reach a settlement with Beijing before slapping special duties on Chinese tire imports and acted responsibly in doing so, a senior U.S. economic adviser said on Monday. 

 Larry Summers, director of President Barack Obama's National Economic Council, further defended the decision, saying Washington had tried to negotiate a solution with Beijing but those talks failed. "I believe it would have been an abdication of responsibility if we had not carried through on the legal obligation we had to protect from (an import surge). We suggested ways to reach a negotiated solution and that (failed)," Summers told business executives at the Fortune Most Powerful Women conference in Carlsbad, California. He said China had agreed to allow "temporary cushioning" as a condition of its entry into the World Trade Organization. Summers, who as president of Harvard University once said women were less adept at math and sciences than men, also underscored the need for deep reform of financial regulations -- a top priority for the White House. Obama warned financial firms on Monday to heed the lessons of Lehman Brothers' collapse a year ago and get behind a regulatory overhaul he wants Congress to pass this year, saying signs of economic and financial recovery should not yield an excuse to avoid reform. Summers said the political will to accomplish far-reaching financial reform was "very strong." "We only do this every several decades so we need to get it right," he said. "I am very confident you will see the farthest reaching financial reforms since the Great Depression passed in the near future." Under a proposal put forward in June, the Federal Reserve would get new powers to monitor big financial firms and a new Consumer Financial Protection Agency would be created. Obama emphasized the CFPA as he outlined his proposals, indicating it has become a top priority. But many of the overhaul provisions are controversial and have met resistance from Wall Street and the legislation has bogged down in Congress, possibly delaying reforms until 2010 or resulting in a watered-down package. Congressman Barney Frank, who is at the center of efforts to overhaul financial rules, said the Obama administration may have to compromise on its proposal to put the Fed in charge of systemic risk. Summers declined to comment on Frank's statement. He said the economy "had turned a very important corner from rescue to recovery ... This is looking like a more successfully surgical intervention than one could have reasonably expected six months ago." The government's aggressive intervention in the financial crisis -- pumping hundreds of billions into the private sector -- could make its exit strategy easier, he said. "I actually think we are going to be able to get out faster and with less cost to taxpayers than otherwise would have been possible." He had no "date certain" for recouping the government's investment in insurer AIG but said the company "has plans for strengthening the key insurance business so they will be ready for sale." Nor does the government want to remain in the auto business, he said. "General Motors and Chrysler are running ahead of projections and running with central governance coming from their boards rather than the government."
