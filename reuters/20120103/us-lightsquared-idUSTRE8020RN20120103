 (Reuters) - Billionaire hedge fund manager Philip Falcone's LightSquared Inc on Tuesday named telecommunications veteran Marc Montagner as chief financial officer, replacing Michael Montemarano. 
 LightSquared is trying to position itself as a low-cost alternative to the big wireless operators like Verizon Communications Inc ( VZ.N ) and AT&T ( T.N ). Montagner, who has nearly 25 years of experience, had worked with France Telecom FTE.PA, Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ), Sprint Nextel ( S.N ) and Banc of America Securities ( BAC.N ). He was responsible for mergers and acquisitions at Sprint and supervised the merger between Sprint and Nextel. On Monday, Sprint Nextel extended a December 31 deadline for LightSquared, with which it may share infrastructure, to get a regulatory clearance for operating a planned telecommunications network.
