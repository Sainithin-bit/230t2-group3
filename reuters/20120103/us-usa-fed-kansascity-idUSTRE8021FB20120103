 (Reuters) - The Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank promoted its information technology chief to the bank's No. 2 post under the institution's new president, Esther George. 
 Kelly Dubbert, who has worked at the Kansas City Fed since 1986, will be first vice president at the institution and its chief operating officer, the bank said in a statement on Tuesday. George took the reins at the bank in October after long-time hawk Thomas Hoenig retired. George's personal views on monetary policy are not widely known. Dubbert would participate in discussions at the Federal Reserve's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee if George were absent. Dubbert has a bachelor's degree from Kansas State University and is a graduate of Harvard University's Advanced Management Program and the Wisconsin Graduate School of Banking. He had headed the Kansas City Fed's information technology division since 2006. (Reporting by  Jason Lange  in Washington; Editing by Leslie Adler)
