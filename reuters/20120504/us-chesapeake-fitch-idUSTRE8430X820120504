 (Reuters) - Fitch Ratings revised Chesapeake Energy Corp's ( CHK.N ) ratings outlook to negative, but maintained the company's current default rating at BB, Fitch said on Friday. 
 "The revised Outlook stems from a still aggressive capital spending program for 2012 in a very weak natural gas environment," Fitch said in a statement. The ratings agency added that "corporate governance and board of director oversight" remains a concern. Shares were lately up 20 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $17.39 a share.
