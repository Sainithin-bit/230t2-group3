 (Reuters) - Medical device maker Boston Scientific Corp ( BSX.N ) said a jury in the U.S. District Court in San Francisco found that the company infringed a patent of Cordis Corp, a unit of Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ.N ). 

 Boston Scientific said the jury also found four of the company's patents, which it said were infringed by Cordis, to be invalid. The patents in the case involve balloon catheter technology. Boston Scientific said no damages were determined as the judge found that Cordis failed to submit enough evidence to enable a jury to make a damage assessment. The company said it will request the judge to overturn the finding of infringement.
