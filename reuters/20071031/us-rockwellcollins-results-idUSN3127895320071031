 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Rockwell Collins Inc ( COL.N ) said on Wednesday quarterly profit rose a greater-than-expected 13 percent, helped by sales of its aviation electronics as the commercial and military aerospace business continues to boom. 

 The Cedar Rapids, Iowa, company, which supplies Boeing ( BA.N ), Airbus ( EAD.PA ) and U.S. forces with a range of cockpit and electronic systems, reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings of $156 million, or 93 cents per share, compared with $138 million, or 79 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. That beat Wall Street's average forecast of 89 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 16 percent to $1.23 billion, ahead of analysts' average estimate of $1.17 billion. Rockwell, like most aerospace suppliers, is benefiting from record levels of U.S. defense spending and a three-year boom in commercial aircraft production amid a resurgence in global travel. The company said revenue at its commercial systems unit was boosted by sales of avionics equipment for Boeing 787 simulators. Boeing's new carbon-composite plane -- one of its biggest-ever projects -- is in the process of ground tests and is not set to fly until next year. Earlier this month, Boeing put back the plane's production schedule by six months, but did not postpone deliveries from major suppliers such as Rockwell Collins. Rockwell made no mention of Boeing's delay on Wednesday. For fiscal year 2008, which began on October 1, Rockwell kept its forecast for earnings of $3.80 to $3.95 per share on sales of $4.7 billion to $4.75 billion. Analysts are expecting earnings of $3.90 per share on sales of $4.77 billion, on average. (Reporting by  Bill Rigby )
