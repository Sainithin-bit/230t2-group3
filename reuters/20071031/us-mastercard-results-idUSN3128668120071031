 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - MasterCard Inc ( MA.N ) the largest publicly traded credit card network, posted a stronger- than-expected increase in earnings on Wednesday as consumer spending volume rose globally, and its shares surged more than 20 percent to a record high. 

 Revenue rose 20 percent as the number of credit and debit card transactions that MasterCard processed rose 13 percent. Purchasing volume growth in the United States was 9.4 percent compared with 18.5 percent growth in last year's third quarter, but growth internationally accelerated. "MasterCard's global model is helping them quite a bit. They're one of the more attractive stories in this environment," said Sanjay Sakhrani, analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in New York. In an interview with Reuters, MasterCard Chief Executive Bob Selander said U.S. consumer spending growth may have slowed but still appears fairly strong. "From the standpoint of the data that I do have, I haven't seen any dramatic changes in terms of trends in the U.S. marketplace over the last couple of months," Selander said, adding that October spending data has not yet been tallied up. American Express Co ( AXP.N ) last week posted similar slower growth rates in U.S. transactions and faster growth internationally for the third quarter. MasterCard's third-quarter results were helped by delaying some hiring and marketing expenses until the fourth quarter, analysts said. "It's gotten difficult to determine when MasterCard will defer expenses," said Robert Dodd, analyst at Morgan Keegan in Memphis, Tennessee. The Purchase, New York-based company said third-quarter earnings were $314 million, or $2.31 a share, compared with $193 million, or $1.42 a share, a year earlier. The third quarter results included a $70 million, or 51 cents-a-share, gain from the sale of a stake in Brazilian credit and debit card network Redecard S.A. Excluding that gain, results were $1.80 a share, or 38 cents a share more than analysts on average had expected, according to Reuters Estimates. MasterCard shares rose $32.40 to close at $189.55 on the New York Stock Exchange, their biggest one-day gain since going public last year. HIGH VALUATIONS Revenue rose 20.1 percent to $1.08 billion. The dollar volume of transactions processed on the MasterCard network rose 12.8 percent to $577 billion, in local currency terms. Advertising and market development expenses rose to $264.4 million from $209.2 million in the same quarter last year. The company's shares trade at about 30 times expected 2008 earnings. That ratio may decline a bit as analysts increase their estimates, but is still well above the average for the transaction processing sector of about 20 times. At current levels, shares are appropriately valued, but there is still room for the shares to rise longer term, said KBW's Sakhrani.
