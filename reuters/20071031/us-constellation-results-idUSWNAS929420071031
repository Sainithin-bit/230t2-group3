 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Power company Constellation Energy Group Inc CEG.N said on Wednesday third-quarter earnings fell, hurt by credits to residential customers, along with higher operations and maintenance costs. 

 The company also announced a $1 billion share buyback plan. Constellation, whose planned sale to FPL Group FPL.N collapsed under regulatory scrutiny last year, posted net income of $251.4 million, or $1.38 a share, compared with $324.4 million, or $1.79 per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company posted quarterly earnings of $1.45 a share. (Reporting by  Euan Rocha  and  Lisa Lee )
