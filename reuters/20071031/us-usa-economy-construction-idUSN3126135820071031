 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Construction spending rose surprisingly in September, logging a 0.3 percent gain after the prior month was revised downward, government data on Wednesday showed. 

 The Commerce Department said construction spending increased to a $1.16 trillion seasonally adjusted annual rate in September after the August spending level was revised down to show a 0.2 percent decrease, first reported as a 0.2 percent gain. Analysts polled by Reuters ahead of the report were expecting construction spending to fall 0.5 percent. Still, private residential spending fell by 1.4 percent last month to a $511 billion annual rate, the 19th consecutive monthly decrease and the lowest annual rate since November 2003. However, private nonresidential construction rose 1.5 percent to an all-time high. Construction spending was down 0.8 percent from a year ago, reflecting the 16.8 percent drop in private residential spending during that time period. For the month, public construction hit an all-time high.
