 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Jones Apparel Group Inc ( JNY.N ) reported sharply higher quarterly profit on Wednesday, thanks to a gain on the sale of its Barneys New York chain. 

 The owner of the Nine West, Jones New York and Gloria Vanderbilt brands said net income for the third quarter ended October 6 rose a whopping 535.1 percent to $400.1 million, or $3.97 per share, from $63 million, or 56 cents per share, a year earlier. But excluding items the impact of the Barneys sale, restructuring and severance charges and other special items, adjusted earnings were 51 cents per share, down from 59 cents per share a year earlier. Quarterly revenue fell 4.6 percent to $1.03 billion from $1.08 billion a year before. Sales at company-owned retail stores fell 8.7 percent during the quarter. "Despite the continued challenges in the retail environment throughout the third quarter, which were primarily due to the unseasonably warm weather and economic conditions affecting our target consumer, our business performed in line with our expectations for the period," said Chief Executive Officer Wesley Card in a statement. The company said its 2007 forecast for adjusted earnings per share remains in the range of $1.20 to $1.25, as the Barneys sale, the exit of some moderate sportswear labels and the continuing weakening in the retail environment are offset by a lower tax rate and the benefit of share repurchases. Analysts on average have been expecting $1.28 per share, excluding items, according to Reuters Estimates. Jones, like rival Liz Claiborne Inc LIZ.N, has struggled due to a squeeze on moderate apparel lines, falling demand for traditional upscale brands and lower sales from consolidating department stores that increasingly promote their own private labels.
