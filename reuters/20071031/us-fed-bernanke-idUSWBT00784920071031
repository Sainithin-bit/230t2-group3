 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke will testify before the congressional Joint Economic Committee at a hearing on the U.S. economic outlook, the committee said on Wednesday. 

 At the November 8 hearing, committee members will ask Bernanke for his views on the economic fallout of the subprime mortgage crisis, large trade deficits, the weakening dollar and the overall health of the U.S. economy, the committee said in a release.
