 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Stocks rose sharply and Treasury debt prices extended losses on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates as expected to stimulate the economy, but signaled the risk of inflation makes future cuts less certain. 

 The Fed lowered its benchmark federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point on Wednesday, as expected, to 4.5 percent to limit economic damage from the housing market's downturn. The rate cut "should help forestall" any further deterioration in economic growth, the Fed said, after its cut in the discount rate in August and an aggressive half-point cut in rates made last month.  The dollar slid to a record low against the euro following the Fed's rate reduction and its statement that it expects the pace of economic growth will slow this year. The euro jumped to $1.4504 earlier in the session, a record high, according to Reuters data, while the Canadian dollar hit US$1.0616, its highest level in almost 130 years. U.S. gold futures touched $800.80 an ounce -- not far below the COMEX spot-month record high of $875 set on January 21 in 1980. The dollar's weakness prompted investors to pour some money into gold. U.S. crude oil futures jumped to a record above $94 a barrel on a surprising stock draw. NYMEX December crude settled at a record $94.53, up $4.15. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was up 137.54 points, or 1.00 percent, at 13,930.01. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was up 18.36 points, or 1.20 percent, at 1,549.38. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was up 42.41 points, or 1.51 percent, at 2,859.12 -- near a seven-year high. During the regular session, the Nasdaq climbed to an intraday high at 2,861.51. "The Fed's decision and the accompanying statement sound like the Fed wants to take themselves out of future eases," said Andrew Brenner, analyst with MF Global Inc in New York. Bonds extended losses after the release of the Fed statement. Stronger-than-expected jobs and gross domestic product growth data, along with the stock market's gains, had already pushed bond prices down early in the day. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was down 18/32 in price, with the yield at 4.46 percent, up from 4.39 percent late on Tuesday. Bond yields move inversely to prices. The two-year U.S. Treasury note was down 7/32, with the yield at 3.93 percent, up from 3.81 percent late the previous day. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond was down 26/32, with the yield at 4.73 percent, up from 4.68 percent late on Tuesday. STOCKS CLIMB AFTER BRIEF PULLBACK U.S. stocks rallied, after initially paring earlier gains as rate-sensitive shares of financial companies fell after the news, including JPMorgan Chase ( JPM.N ), and then regained their footing. "The initial market reaction, especially with a dissent in there, is 'Hey don't count on a series of cuts.' That's why we had a pullback in stocks," said Scott Wren, senior equity strategist at A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc In St. Louis. Stocks had been solidly higher before the decision. Government data showing gross domestic product expanded at an annual rate of 3.9 percent in the third quarter -- its fastest rate since the beginning of 2006 -- had added to the positive market tone. Earlier, the ADP National Employment Report showed U.S. private employers added 106,000 jobs in October, above a forecast of 60,000 and September's upwardly revised 61,000 gain. While the surprisingly strong data on Wednesday cast doubts over future Fed rate cuts, many analysts said the protracted housing slump and glitches in the credit market will keep the pressure on Fed policy-makers to ease monetary policy further. DOLLAR AT LOW AGAINST EURO The dollar rose against the yen and crawled off lifetime lows against the euro after the Fed's decision, though it remained slightly lower on the day against the European currency. The dollar was down against a basket of major trading-partner currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index .DXY down 0.38 percent at 76.478 from a previous session close of 76.773. The euro was up 0.35 percent at $1.4489 late in the day -- off its record high above $1.45 -- but above the previous session close of $1.4438. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar was up 0.61 percent at 115.32 from a previous session close of 114.62. In overseas stock trading, the FTSEurofirst 300 index  .FTEU3  gained 0.9 percent, or 14.01 points, to end at 1,595.70, a two-week high, on a rally in bank and retail shares. Strong U.S. data created a buoyant mood ahead of the Fed's interest-rate decision. Japan's benchmark Nikkei average  .N225  added 0.5 percent, or 86.62 points, to close at 16,737.63, following a surge in Fujifilm's shares on a higher full-year profit forecast.
