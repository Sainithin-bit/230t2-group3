 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Kraft Foods Inc KFT.N on Wednesday posted a 20-percent drop in quarterly profit, hit by soaring dairy costs, though sales and earnings still beat analysts estimates. 

 The largest North American food company has boosted spending on marketing and has seen sales lifted by new products, even as it raises prices to cope with rising ingredient costs. The company, which derives almost one-fifth of its sales from cheese, said profit was $596 million, or 38 cents a share, in the third quarter, compared with $748 million, or 45 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, earnings were 44 cents a share for the company, whose broad portfolio also includes Oscar Mayer deli meats, Oreo cookies and DiGiorno pizza. Analysts on average forecast 41 cents a share. Sales rose 9.8 percent to $9.05 billion, besting the average analyst estimate of $8.7 billion. Excluding acquisitions and a 2.5 percentage point boost from the weak dollar, sales still rose 6.2 percent. Volume, a measure of products shipped, rose 2 percent, despite price increases. Kraft, which was spun off from Altria Group Inc ( MO.N ) on March 30, said it still expects earnings of $1.80 to $1.82 a share, excluding one-time items. Analysts on average forecast $1.81 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. The company plans to spend $500 million, or 20 cents a share on restructuring in 2007, down from its previous estimate of $575 million, or 23 cents a share.
