 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Internet conglomerate IAC/InterActiveCorp ( IACI.O ) reported on Wednesday a quarterly profit that was slightly ahead of Wall Street expectations and posted revenue growth at its shopping network HSN that revived investor hopes for a turnaround at the troubled unit. 

 Shares in IAC, which is controlled by media veteran and Internet investor Barry Diller, rose 4 percent in early trading to $29.53. Goldman Sachs analyst Anthony Noto said in a note to clients that the results were ahead of his expectations. "Most trends showed a positive trajectory, with the exception of continued issues at Lending that were likely anticipated given the macro environment," Noto said, referring to the company's LendingTree mortgage unit. IAC said its third-quarter net profit available to common shareholders fell to $71.8 million, or 24 cents per share, from $74.9 million, or 24 cents, a year ago. The results were hurt by higher expenses at HSN and an operating loss at LendingTree. Before special items, earnings were 37 cents a share, the company said. Revenue rose 7.4 percent to $1.52 billion. Analysts on average had forecast earnings at 35 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates, on revenue of $1.53 billion. "With the exception of LendingTree, this was a satisfactory quarter for IAC," Diller said in a statement. "Trends at our businesses are good, and particularly so at HSN."
