 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Senior Obama administration officials on Monday said in a newspaper op-ed piece that a landmark financial regulation reform plan to be released this week will target capital requirements, securitization and other problem areas blamed for the global financial crisis. 

 In the most complete summary of the plan seen in some time, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and National Economic Council Chairman Lawrence Summers said the plan would offer "a stronger framework for consumer and investor protection." The piece was published in The Washington Post days ahead of the expected release on Wednesday of a package of administration proposals following six months of debate about what should be in it.
