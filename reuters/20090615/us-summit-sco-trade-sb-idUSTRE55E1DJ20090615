 The following are details about trade between Russia and China: BILATERAL TRADE: -- Trade between the two nations soared 38.6 percent last year to $55.9 billion. China is Russia's second largest trade partner after the European Union. Trade with the EU totaled $382.1 billion last year, or 52 percent of Russia's $735 billion foreign trade while trade with China totaled 7.6 percent. Russia has a trade deficit with China of $13.6 billion, its biggest trading deficit. - China and Russia say they have plans to increase bilateral trade to $60-80 billion by 2010. ENERGY: -- China is a hungry customer for Russian mineral resources and Moscow is keen to diversify buyers for its oil and gas amid rising tensions with major European customers. - Russia will start shipping crude to China in 2010 via the country's first pipeline to Asia, which will supply around four percent of China's annual crude demand. -- Russian gas export monopoly Gazprom wants to supply China with pipeline gas. In 2006, the Russian gas export monopoly said it would build two major pipelines to China but the project has been delayed due to disagreements over gas pricing with Beijing. -- China's state-owned Sinopec group has a multi-billion dollar investment with Russia's biggest oil producer, Rosneft.

LOANS: -- China, which holds the world's largest gold and forex reserves, has increased lending to Russian companies in recent months. -- China's Development Bank has opened a credit line worth $1 billion to its Russian equivalent, state corporation VEB, to finance investment projects by Chinese companies in Russia, VEB said on Sunday. -- China's Development Bank has also agreed to lend VEB $310 million to finance construction of a cement factory by developer LSR Group , which will create 450 new jobs in the Leningrad region in Russia's north-west. -- Russian state-run oil firm Rosneft and state oil pipeline monopoly Transneft have agreed a $25 billion loan from the Development Bank secured by 20 years of oil supplies. -- Russia's second-largest bank VTB received a seven-year, $240 million loan from Export-Import Bank of China while third largest mobile operator Megafon received a $300 million loan also from the Development Bank.
