 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc and the private sector arm of the World Bank have struck a deal to offer a $1.25 billion funding facility intended to stimulate emerging markets trade over three years. 

 The U.S. bank said on Monday it would provide 60 percent, or about $750 million, while the World Bank arm, International Finance Corp, and other development agencies will purchase participations for the remaining $500 million. The groups said they expect the funding to support trade flows of up to $7.5 billion. Under the facility, Citi will provide funding to banks in Asia, Africa, Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe, and the Middle East. With the partnership, Citi aims to get a lead over competitors by tapping into opportunities arising from lack of credit in the capital markets, which has driven up the price of trade finance, according to the Financial Times.
