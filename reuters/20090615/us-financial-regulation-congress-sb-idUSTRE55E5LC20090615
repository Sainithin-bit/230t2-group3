 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Congressional committees have tentatively scheduled more than a dozen hearings between now and mid-July to examine proposals to overhaul U.S. financial regulation, said congressional aides on Monday. 

 New hearings not previously announced include one on Monday, June 22, at the Senate securities subcommittee focused on regulating over-the-counter derivatives, a Senate aide said. Witnesses at that hearing are expected to include Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Schapiro, Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Gary Gensler and bank executives, the aide said. The House Financial Services Committee and the House Agriculture Committee have tentatively scheduled a joint hearing on the same topic for June 23, said a House aide. The House Financial Services Committee and subcommittees have tentatively set hearings on regulatory restructuring for June 24, 25 and 26, and July 15, 16 and 17, the aide said. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner is scheduled to testify on Thursday before the Senate Banking Committee and the House Financial Services Committee on regulatory reform. The House capital markets subcommittee will hold a hearing on Tuesday on insurance industry oversight.
