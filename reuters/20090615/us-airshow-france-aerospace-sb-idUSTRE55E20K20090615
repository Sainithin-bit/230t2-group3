 PARIS  (Reuters) - The much-delayed A400M military transport aircraft is vital for France and delays must be reduced as much as possible, French Prime Minister Francois Fillon said on Monday. 

 "For us, this program is essential," Fillon told journalists at the Paris Air Show, which opened on Monday. Fillon also said the government would increase support to small and mid-sized aerospace companies, adding that it was working on plans for reimbursable loans. "The French government will support the aerospace industry with all its strength," Fillon said.
