 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Obama administration's financial regulatory reform plan would require originators of asset-backed securities to retain 5 percent of the credit risk, CNBC reported on Monday. 

 The financial news channel, citing a Treasury spokesman, also said the plan would prohibit security originators from hedging their retained credit risk. (Reporting by  Tim Ahmann , Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
