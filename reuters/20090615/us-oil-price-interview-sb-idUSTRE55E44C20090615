 LONDON  (Reuters) - Oil prices should not rise too quickly and hurt the world economy, but a price of $80 a barrel would not put a brake on growth, OPEC's Secretary General told Reuters on Monday. 

 "Of course we do not want to see oil prices rising too rapidly and certainly not to harm growth in the global economy," Abdullah al-Badri said in an email response to questions. "We need a stable oil price." "Yes, I am concerned that high oil prices will affect the economy but even at $80 a barrel, I am confident that this will not be the case."
