 (Reuters) - Aircraft components maker Goodrich Corp GR.N said on Monday it signed service agreements with EADS ( EAD.PA ) unit Airbus, British Airways BAY.L and Scandinavian Airlines System ( SAS.ST ). 

 The company, which makes aircraft wheels, brakes and landing gear, will provide cabin attendant seats for the Airbus A350 XWB aircraft. The Airbus deal is expected to generate $100 million in original equipment and aftermarket revenue over the life of the program, Goodrich said. Goodrich signed a service agreement with British Airways covering engine controls systems for Boeing 747 and 767 aircraft. The deal covers over 300 Rolls-Royce RB211-524 engines for a minimum of five years, the company said. The company also signed a 5-year deal with Scandinavian Airlines System to provide thrust reverser overhaul services on all V2500 engines that are used in the carrier's Airbus A320 aircraft. In April Goodrich cut its sales forecast and the upper end of its outlook for the full year, citing weakness in commercial aerospace.
