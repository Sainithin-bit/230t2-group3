 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Obama administration will target critical weaknesses in the troubled U.S. financial system, such as thin bank capital cushions and eroded lending standards, when it proposes an overhaul of financial regulation this week, two senior officials said on Monday. 

 In the fullest summary to date of the administration's reform plan, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and White House economic adviser Lawrence Summers urged stronger consumer and investor protections, new "systemic risk" policing powers for the Federal Reserve, and less reliance on credit ratings. The plan was outlined by the officials in The Washington Post ahead of the release on Wednesday of a detailed package of proposals that has been under discussion for six months. President Barack Obama will speak on Wednesday on his "new rules of the road for the financial industry," a White House official said. Geithner will joint him at the event. Obama has said he wants to enact changes into law by the end of the year. Several more months of debate lie ahead in Congress, with Democrats widely supportive of the president's plan. A group of U.S. House of Representatives Republicans last week unveiled a rival package of more modest proposals. "The White House plan is similar to the House Republican regulatory reform legislation in some ways," House Republican Leader John Boehner said in a statement. "But it also includes a provision that would allow government bureaucrats to continue deciding behind closed doors who gets taxpayer funds." In a sharp repudiation of government bailouts launched last year under the Republican Bush administration, some congressional Republicans are now making the slogan "no more bailouts" the centerpiece of their reform strategy. Committees of the U.S. Congress have scheduled more than a dozen hearings between now and mid-July on financial reforms, congressional aides told Reuters on Monday. At the same time, the powerful financial services industry is pushing to water down the Obama plan, with time on the side of the status quo, especially if the economy keeps improving and public outrage over the financial crisis fades. RULES REWRITE SOUGHT Administration officials have argued that a rewrite of U.S. financial rules is needed to prevent future crises like the one that has been hammering world economies since early 2008. The Geithner-Summers outline offered few new details not already known and it sidestepped questions about streamlining bank supervision and regulating over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. But it did clearly underline the administration's determination to give the Federal Reserve a central role, and to create a new way for the government to handle troubled, large, non-bank firms whose failure could pose a risk to the economy. Geithner and Summers said a key goal will be "raising capital and liquidity requirements for all institutions," with tighter standards for the biggest, most interconnected firms. In addition, they said, the big firms whose failure could threaten the entire system "will be subject to consolidated supervision by the Federal Reserve, and we will establish a council of regulators with broader coordinating responsibility across the financial system." The officials said the plan will also propose new reporting requirements for issuers of asset-backed securities, as well as a rule saying securitizers must "retain a financial interest" in the asset-backed securities they are involved in issuing. ERODING LENDING STANDARDS EYED Securitization, or the packaging and selling of loans as securities, has been blamed by critics for eroding lending standards in the mortgage and other lending businesses. A Treasury spokesman said the administration would propose requiring lenders to retain 5.0 percent of the risk they securitize. A bill to do this was approved in May by the U.S. House of Representatives, but is languishing in the Senate. Addressing another market implicated in the crisis, the officials said the Obama plan will urge oversight of OTC derivatives. It will call for unspecified "harmonizing" of futures and securities regulation, and stronger payment and settlement systems, they said. They also said the plan will call for a new mechanism to seize and unwind troubled large non-bank firms. In March, the administration proposed giving this authority to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp in the hope of avoiding on-the-fly approaches, such as the costly bailout of mega-insurer American International Group. The plan will also urge reducing "investors' and regulators' reliance on credit-rating agencies," the officials said, in a provision likely to affect credit rating giants such as Standard & Poor's and Moody's Corp. WORLD LEADERSHIP Summers and Geithner said the United States "will lead the effort to improve regulation and supervision around the world." The European Union has moved out briskly on financial reform, announcing plans for a systemic risk council and a crackdown on hedge funds, but tensions remain to be resolved over the regulatory roles of the EU and its 27 member nations. On bank supervision, Geithner has previously said the administration will "streamline" financial regulation. But he has stopped short of endorsing particular changes. One proposal with some political support is merging the Office of Thrift Supervision, which mainly regulates mortgage lenders, with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which regulates some of the nation's largest banks. No mention was made in the outline of that idea. Nor was any mention made of possibly merging the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Such a move was once seen likely, but is off the table, said sources familiar with administration discussions.
