 PARIS  (Reuters) - Now may be a good time to place an order for new aircraft, the finance chief of United Airlines parent UAL Corp UAUA.O told Reuters on Monday. 

 Any order could be a mix of planes from both Boeing ( BA.N ) and European rival Airbus ( EAD.PA ), Kathryn Mikells said in an interview at the Paris Air Show, adding that fuel efficiency and maintenance costs would be key to any decision. Mikells added that capacity cuts by airlines in the United States were "greatly needed."
