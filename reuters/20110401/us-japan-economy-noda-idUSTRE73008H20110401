 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda said the government was not considering asking the Bank of Japan to underwrite government bonds to help fund disaster relief after last month's devastating earthquake and tsunami, and it would need to be cautious about asking for any such underwriting. 

 He added that the government would freeze about 5 percent of public works spending in the budget for the fiscal year that began on Friday to focus on disaster relief. (Reporting by  Tetsushi Kajimoto  and  Leika Kihara ; Editing by Edmund Klamann)
