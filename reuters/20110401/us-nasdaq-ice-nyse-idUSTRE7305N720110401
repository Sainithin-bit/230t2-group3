 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Nasdaq OMX Group and IntercontinentalExchange are confident on getting financing for their unsolicited bid for NYSE Euronext, but decided to wait to gauge the Big Board's response before signing commitments, a source familiar with the matter said on Friday. 

 The exchange operators have the financing papers for the roughly $11 billion bid ready to go when needed, the source said, declining to be named because these discussions are not public. (Reporting by  Paritosh Bansal , editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
