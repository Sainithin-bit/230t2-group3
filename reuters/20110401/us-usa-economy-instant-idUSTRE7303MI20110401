 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. manufacturing sector grew at a marginally slower pace in March after accelerating at its fastest rate in nearly seven years the month before, according to an industry report released on Friday. 

 CONSTRUCTION SPENDING: U.S. construction spending fell more than expected in February to its lowest level since October 1999, a government report showed on Friday, pulled down by weakness in both public and private construction. KEY POINTS: * The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity dipped to 61.2 last month from 61.4 in February, roughly in line with economists' expectations for a reading of 61.0. * A reading below 50 indicates contraction in the manufacturing sector, while a number above 50 means expansion. COMMENTS: DAVID SLOAN, ECONOMIST, IFR ECONOMICS, A UNIT OF THOMSON REUTERS: "Even if March sees some recovery assisted by improved weather, construction looks set to be a clear negative in the Q1 GDP breakdown, where other components also look to be heading for disappointing outcomes. The arithmetic suggests a Q1 GDP outcome below 2.0% cannot be ruled out. Total construction spending is now at its lowest level since October 1999 with private spending at its lowest since April 1997."
