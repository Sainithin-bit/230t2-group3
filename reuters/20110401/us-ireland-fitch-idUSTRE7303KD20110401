 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Ireland was put on review for a potential downgrade to its credit ratings on Friday by Fitch Ratings. 

 Fitch said it placed Ireland's on rating watch negative and said it may cut Ireland's long-term foreign and local-currency issuer default ratings of 'BBB+'. Earlier in the day Standard & Poor's stripped Ireland of its last 'A' rating, citing future risks to bondholders, but the one notch cut was less severe than feared.
