 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Tokyo Electric Power Co ( 9501.T ) said on Friday that it was unaware of any government plan to inject public funds into it and that now was not the time to discuss the future structure of the company. 

 Tokyo Electric was responding to an earlier Mainichi newspaper report that said the government was planning to inject public funds into the utility, citing an unnamed government official. (Reporting by  Nathan Layne )
