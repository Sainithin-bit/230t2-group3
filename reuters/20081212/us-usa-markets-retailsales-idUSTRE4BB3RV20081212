 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Sales at U.S. retailers posted a fifth straight drop in November as gasoline sales took a record tumble, according to government data on Friday that showed consumers still shopping despite the recession. 

 U.S. producer prices fell slightly more than expected in November as energy costs slumped for the fourth consecutive month, government data showed on Friday, providing further evidence that price pressures were abating sharply. KEY POINTS: RETAIL SALES: * The Commerce Department said total retail sales fell 1.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted $355.66 billion last month following a revised 2.9 percent plunge in October. * Excluding motor vehicles and parts, sales were down 1.6 percent in November after a revised 2.4 percent October fall. * The November sales decline was slightly less than the drops of 1.9 percent for total sales and 1.8 percent for sales excluding motor vehicles forecast by Wall Street economists surveyed by Reuters. * Gasoline sales plummeted a record 14.7 percent after falling 12.9 percent in October. PRODUCER PRICES: * The Labor Department said the producer price index fell 2.2 percent, also posting its fourth straight monthly decline. * The index dropped 2.8 percent in October, which was the biggest monthly decline on record. * Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a 2.0 percent decline in the headline number. * Compared to the same period last year, the producer price index rose by 0.4 percent, the lowest reading since January 2007, braking sharply from a 5.2 percent increase in October. * Core producer prices excluding food and energy costs increased by 0.1 percent in November, matching market expectations and slowing from October's 0.4 percent increase. * Core producer prices were up 4.2 percent over the last 12 months. COMMENTS: KEVIN HARRIS, CHIEF ECONOMIST, INFORMA GLOBAL MARKETS, NEW YORK: "We're seeing some headlines that say this number is better than expected. But if you look at the actual dollar figure these figures are worse than expected. This is a bad number." MATT ESTEVE, FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRADER, TEMPUS CONSULTING,  WASHINGTON: "The data came out largely within expectations. I was actually surprised by the retail sales data. I thought that would actually be a little bit worse than expected. I guess we'll see what happens next month if they have to revise it down. "We haven't seen that big of a move yet, except that the dollar has decreased significantly against the Japanese yen. Unfortunately, I think risk aversion still dominates trades here, but the dollar is no longer benefiting from it. Investors are still flocking to the yen with the Japanese banks obviously a little bit better insulated from this global downturn than the American banks and definitely the European banks." KIM RUPERT, MANAGING DIRECTOR, GLOBAL FIXED INCOME ANALYSIS, ACTION ECONOMICS LLC, SAN FRANCISCO: "It came in pretty close to most expectations so it's not too surprising. Still pretty hefty declines in retail sales although not the pace we saw in October. "We're in a recession, sentiment is very bad and it is not surprising to see sales continuing to fall. "The market had already priced in bad news. The numbers met those expectations, so it was almost a buy-the-rumor, sell-the-fact type of trade." ROBERT MACINTOSH, CHIEF ECONOMIST, EATON VANCE CORP, BOSTON: "It just speaks to how weak economy is, and it is definitely impacting costs. I think this all fits with the fact we are in a pretty deep recession. "Everything else being equal, this is supposed to be positive for bonds. It shouldn't be a surprise to anybody. "What worries me is the panic that retailers put in peoples' minds that they had go shop at 5 a.m. the day after Thanksgiving. There might have been borrowing of spending in December into November, so even though this number looks pretty weak on the face of it, it may be actually less weak than it would have been. Therefore, I think December is going to be pretty grim. So it's hard to make a clear conclusion until you see December's numbers and meld them together." PETER KENNY, MANAGING DIRECTOR, KNIGHT EQUITY MANAGEMENT, JERSEY CITY, NEW JERSEY: "First of all, no surprise here. This is ugly and getting uglier. Retail sales, you name it, auto sales, the entire retail space is under enormous pressure. Some were hoping for a surprise, hoping for better-than-expected numbers, and they didn't really get it. "Core PPI is a little bit of a surprise, but its still pointing toward a deflationary environment, the likes of which we haven't seen in ages. "Pick your poison. Do you want to talk about autos, or some of the macroeconomic data we've had coming out or do you want to talk about Madoff? If there's something positive here, share it with me. I see nothing here that is going to give anyone any reason to buy the market." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. equity index futures little changed after better-than-expected retail sales data. BONDS: U.S. Treasuries trim gains. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar little changed.
