 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A Federal Reserve spokeswoman on Friday declined comment on House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi's call for the Treasury Department or the Fed -- the U.S. central bank -- to lend to ailing U.S. auto makers if legislative solutions stall. 

 Pelosi, a California Democrat, urged that the White House and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson consider short-term financial assistance for struggling car makers, including use of the $700 billion financial rescue fund or measures open to the Fed, after congressional negotiations collapsed. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke last week told a senior Senator that the Fed would be "extremely reluctant" to lend to car makers if Congress, after a period of hearings and debate, decided not to help the industry. "Our view is that questions of industrial policy are best resolved by Congress because they require balancing political and social priorities about the shape and desirability of involvement by domestic companies in specific industries," Bernanke said in a December 5 letter to Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd.
