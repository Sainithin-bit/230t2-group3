 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co ( 7267.T )( HMC.N ) will cut another 119,000 units from planned production in North America through March amid a deepening downturn in industrywide auto sales, the company said on Friday. 

 The latest production cut means Honda will have cut a total of 175,000 vehicles from planned production for its fiscal year ending in March 2009. The move by Honda follows similar steps by most other automakers, including Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T )( TM.N ) in the U.S. market, where consumer demand has slumped due to tight credit and a weakened economy. Honda's vehicle production for the current fiscal year will now total 1,293,000 vehicles, down 12 percent from a year earlier. Like rivals, Honda has been hurt by the collapse in sales of cars and trucks in the United States, a downturn that accelerated in October and November amid tightening credit and deepening consumer uncertainty. Honda's U.S. sales dropped 32 percent in November from a year ago. Year-to-date, Honda's U.S. sales are down 5 percent. (Reporting by  Soyoung Kim ; editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)
