 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The auto and mortgage finance company GMAC LLC raced on Friday to meet a self-imposed deadline to complete a debt swap that would qualify it for federal aid, and avoid what analysts called a potential bankruptcy. 

 GMAC is trying to swap $38 billion of debt for a smaller amount of debt, preferred stock and cash, in an effort to raise sufficient capital to become a bank holding company. This would make it eligible for capital infusions under the U.S. Treasury Department's $700-billion bank rescue plan. The Detroit-based lender needs holders of 75 percent of the debt to agree to the swap, but on Wednesday said it was less than one-third of the way to that goal. It extended a deadline for holders to swap their debt under more favorable terms to 5 p.m. EST on Friday. But it said that if the swap fails, it will withdraw its application to become a bank and explore other options. "GMAC may need to extend the deadline," said Mirko Mikelic, a portfolio manager at Fifth Third Asset Management in Grand Rapids, Michigan, which invests $22 billion. "Becoming a bank holding company is pretty much GMAC's last lifeline. If it doesn't happen, then there's a very high likelihood of a Chapter 11 filing, at minimum." Bankruptcy would be an admission of failure for private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management LP CBS.UL, which in 2006 bought 51 percent of GMAC from General Motors Corp ( GM.N ). The automaker kept the rest. Gina Proia, a GMAC spokeswoman, said on Friday morning: "We have no update right now. When we do, we'll put it out." Cerberus did not immediately return a request for comment. Created in 1919, GMAC has lost $7.9 billion in the five quarters ending Sept 30. While its Residential Capital LLC mortgage unit has been the main source of its troubles, GMAC's auto finance unit is also losing money as more borrowers are missing payments and the value of leased vehicles declines. Cerberus also owns 80 percent of Chrysler LLC. That automaker, along with GM, are scrambling to avoid their own bankruptcies, following the failure Thursday night of a proposed bailout of automakers in the U.S. Senate. In partnership with GM, a consortium of 1,200 Midwest credit unions this week pledged to make $10 billion of loans to fund vehicle purchases. This could cushion damage if GMAC were to go bankrupt or otherwise further reduce its lending. Analysts said GMAC bondholders may be holding out for better terms, and might be less willing to help out in the absence of government help for General Motors. "Investors who own this debt at this time could have a strong incentive to take over this company and force Cerberus out," Mikelic said. Bond investors are showing little confidence that GMAC can pay even its bills over the next several weeks. The lender's 6.15 percent notes maturing January 15 were quoted late Wednesday at 90 cents on the dollar, yielding 140.17 percent, according to bond pricing service Trace.
