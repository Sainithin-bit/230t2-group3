 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The White House weighed emergency funding to avert collapse of the U.S. auto industry on Friday and buttress a financial system tested anew by possibly the biggest Wall Street fraud ever. 

 Ecuador declared itself in default on its debt, OPEC debated production cuts and Europe agreed to a 200 billion euro ($268 billion) stimulus while America struggled to navigate the recession with President George W. Bush a lame duck until Barack Obama takes over on January 20. "This is ugly and getting uglier," Peter Kenny, managing director at Knight Equity Management in New Jersey, said on Friday. "Pick your poison. Do you want to talk about autos, or some of the macroeconomic data we've had coming out or do you want to talk about Madoff? If there's something positive here, share it with me." The pain was already widespread in the U.S. economy, where 10.3 million Americas are out of work and Wall Street bonuses are expected to fall 50 percent this year. Then Bernard Madoff, a quiet force on Wall Street for decades, was arrested late on Thursday on allegations his hedge fund perpetrated a $50 billion fraud, which sent investors scrambling to assess their potential losses. "It appears that at least $15 billion of wealth, much of which was concentrated in southern Florida and New York City, has gone to 'money heaven,'" said Douglas Kass, who heads hedge fund Seabreeze Partners Management. After Bush failed to persuade senators in his own party to support a $14 billion auto bailout, the White House warned that the U.S. economy could not withstand an auto collapse and said it might provide emergency funding from the $700 billion financial bailout fund known as TARP. That helped Wall Street reverse an early sell-off. .N The Dow  .DJI  and S&P 500  .SPX  both closed about 0.7 percent higher. JOBS IN JEOPARDY The bailout legislation failure prompted concerns that one of the last bastions of the U.S. manufacturing base could be forced into bankruptcy or collapse, jeopardizing millions of jobs and having repercussions worldwide. General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) and Chrysler LLC were seeking billions of dollars in immediate aid to avert collapse, while Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) wanted a hefty line of credit. With the rescue plan dead in Congress, it was unclear what the next step would be from the White House. "What will happen if General Motors goes into Chapter 11? It will be bad for car parts suppliers and many carmakers have the same suppliers. It will be a meltdown, it is a systemic risk," said Gaetan Toulemonde at Deutsche Bank in Paris. The U.S. troubles were accompanied by unsettling news around the world. Ecuador's leftist President Rafael Correa declared he had defaulted on the South American country's foreign debt, refusing to make an interest payment due on Monday on its bonds. That sent Ecuador debt prices plummeting and threatened to halt a recent emerging market rally. Correa is an ally of Venezuela's Hugo Chavez and his slogan is "life before debt." Ecuador has received record income from oil exports this year, and economists say it has enough funds to make the payment but the default is driven by ideology. Tokyo's Nikkei average  .N225  fell 5.6 percent on the bailout failure, even as Japan expanded a fiscal stimulus plan and increased a war chest for bank rescues to $131 billion. Tokyo had kept markets guessing on whether it would intervene to stop a surging yen from pushing the economy deeper into recession, but that likelihood passed once the dollar stabilized above the 91-yen rate after the White House signaled it might use TARP funds to help the auto industry. European stocks  .FTEU3  closed down 2.8 percent after European Union leaders sealed the 200 billion-euro stimulus package, which had exposed deep differences between Britain and Germany. The good news for consumers was falling oil and commodities prices. Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) slashed its commodity price forecasts, citing a collapse in global economic growth and demand because of the credit crisis. However, OPEC appeared likely to agree on another big production cut when it meets in Algeria next week in the face of shrinking fuel demand and battered oil prices. The issue was how deep that cut should be. Demand is down with the United States, Europe and Japan in recession, but China's once insatiable appetite for oil has diminished as well.
