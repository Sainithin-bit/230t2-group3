 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oil prices settled nearly $2 lower on Friday after the collapse of a $14 billion rescue plan for U.S. automakers kept Wall Street and oil markets volatile. 

 U.S. crude oil settled down $1.70 at $46.28 a barrel, after falling below $44 earlier. London Brent crude settled down 98 cents at $46.41 a barrel. Oil recovered from earlier lows as U.S. stocks pared losses on the possibility that the White House or U.S. Treasury might come through with an aid package for the automakers, after the Senate failed to approve a $14 billion plan late Thursday. Oil has fallen from record highs above $147 a barrel in July as the global economic crisis dents demand in large consumer nations. U.S. bank Goldman Sachs on Friday predicted oil could drop as low as $30 as the credit crunch puts a strangle-hold on the world economy. "The auto bailout plan dying in the Senate is weighing on all markets," said Tom Bentz, an analyst at BNP Paribas Commodity Futures Inc. "Yesterday's late pullback is looking like another failure on the upside." The plight of Detroit's Big Three U.S. automakers -- General Motors, Chrysler and Ford -- illustrates the severity of the global economic downturn that has hit demand for oil. U.S. Department of Transportation figures showed U.S. motorists drove 9 billion fewer miles in October than a year earlier, down 3.5 percent. [ID:nWAT010658] Sales at U.S. retailers fell for a fifth straight month in November -- the longest decline in at least 16 years -- as consumers tightened belts during the credit squeeze. "The collapse in world oil demand in the fourth quarter of 2008 as the global credit crunch intensified now threatens to push oil prices below $40 a barrel in the near term," Goldman Sachs said in a research note. "The impact of the global economic recession has swung the oil market from pricing demand destruction in 2008 to pricing supply destruction in 2009," it added. OPEC MULLS MORE SUPPLY CUTS Goldman Sachs, which earlier this year had predicted $200 per barrel oil, virtually halved its 2009 price forecast for U.S. crude to $45 a barrel and said the price could fall to $30 in the short term, hitting a trough in the first quarter. The bank said a cut of an extra 2 million barrels per day by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries was needed. The producer group meets next Wednesday in Algeria. French bank BNP Paribas cut its 2009 price forecast to $53 a barrel from $75. OPEC President Chakib Khelil has called for more "severe" supply cuts at next week's meeting. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said the country was ready to work with OPEC on possible oil output cuts. Japan's Nippon Oil said it expected OPEC to agree to cut 1.5 million to 2 million bpd next week.
