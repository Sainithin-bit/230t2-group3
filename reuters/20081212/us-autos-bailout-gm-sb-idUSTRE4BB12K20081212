 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp was "deeply disappointed" at the U.S. Senate's failure to reach an agreement on a U.S. auto industry bailout package, a spokesman said late on Thursday. 

 "We are deeply disappointed that agreement could not be reached tonight in the Senate despite the best bipartisan efforts," GM spokesman Tony Cervone said. "We will assess all of our options to continue our restructuring and to obtain the means to weather the current economic crisis." The U.S. Senate failed on Thursday night to reach a last-ditch compromise on a bailout program to support U.S. automakers GM, Chrysler and Ford Motor Co, effectively killing congressional action on the matter this year.
