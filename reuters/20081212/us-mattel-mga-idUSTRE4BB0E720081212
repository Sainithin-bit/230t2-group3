 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Toymaker MGA Entertainment asked a California federal judge on Thursday to indefinitely delay enforcing a court order that bars it from selling its popular Bratz dolls and using the Bratz name. 

 MGA attorney Thomas Nolan filed a notice of appeal late on Thursday, informing the court that MGA intends to appeal the December 4 court order. U.S. District Judge Stephen Larson last week issued a permanent injunction, preventing MGA from selling the dolls, after finding that "hundreds" of Bratz products infringe on copyrights owned by rival toymaker Mattel Inc MAT.N. The judge also ordered MGA to recall all Bratz dolls from retailers and destroy doll molds. The order was stayed until early next year. Nolan told Reuters that he asked Larson to rule by the end of this month on whether he would extend the stay until after the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rules. MGA will seek am emergency stay from the federal appeals court if Larson rules against the company, he added. (Reporting by Syantani Chatterjee; editing by  Richard Chang )
