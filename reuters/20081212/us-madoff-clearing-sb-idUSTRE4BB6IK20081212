 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - All equity trades involving market-making firm Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, which was founded by Bernard Madoff -- the broker arrested for an alleged $50 billion fraud -- will be processed as usual, the Depository Trust Clearing Corp told Reuters on Friday. 

 "Any trades that were received, processed and reported back to firms as of last night (Thursday) involving Madoff's firm will be guaranteed by us," said Stuart Goldstein, spokesman for the DTCC, whose National Securities Clearing Corp arm clears all U.S. equity trades.
