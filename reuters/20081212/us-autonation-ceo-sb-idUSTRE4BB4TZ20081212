 DETROIT  (Reuters) - AutoNation Inc Chief Executive Mike Jackson said on Friday that a failure of one of the U.S. automakers was unlikely as he "fully" expected the White House to extend bridge funding to help the companies get through first quarter of 2009. 

 "I really don't think it will come to (the failure of one of the Big 3)," said Jackson, who runs the largest U.S. public dealership group. The White House said on Friday that it was considering tapping a $700 billion financial industry bailout fund to prevent a collapse of ailing U.S. automakers after a proposed bailout of U.S. automakers failed in the Senate on Thursday night. "I hope he announces it today," Jackson said, referring to President George W. Bush. "I hope he doesn't let this thing twist in the winds through the weekend." Jackson said if there is no decision by the president on the request for a bridge loan, it could lead to a bankruptcy filing by one of the U.S. automakers. Both General Motors Corp and Chrysler LLC have warned they would be forced into bankruptcy within weeks in the absence of government aid. "This is an emergency situation," Jackson said. The CEO said a failure of one of the U.S. automakers would lead to "cascading bankruptcies" among dealers and suppliers. "Only the ones diversified away from the domestics and with the strongest operations and strongest balance sheet will get through a bankruptcy by one of the Detroit three," he said, adding that AutoNation "will get through."
