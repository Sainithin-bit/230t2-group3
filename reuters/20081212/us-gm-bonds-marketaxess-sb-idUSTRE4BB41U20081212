 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp's bonds tumbled on Friday as investors priced in a greater risk of a bankruptcy filing after government efforts to provide urgent funding for the auto industry collapsed. 

 GM's bonds were trading at the same price regardless of maturity, a sign that investors expect a bankruptcy, a trader said. In a bankruptcy, maturities become irrelevant in ranking the order of payments to creditors. GM's 8.375 percent bonds due in 2033 fell to 11 cents on the dollar, down 6 cents on the day, according to MarketAxess. Its 7.2 percent notes due in 2011 also fell to 11 cents on the dollar, down 10 cents on the day. Ford Motor Co's 7.45 percent bonds due in 2031 fell to 17 cents on the dollar, down over 7 cents on the day. The automaker is in a better cash position than GM, but analysts say Ford would be hurt by the failure of a rival, which could flood the market with cheap cars.
