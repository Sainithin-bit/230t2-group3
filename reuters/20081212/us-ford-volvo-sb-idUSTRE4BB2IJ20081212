 STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - The failure of the U.S. government bailout for the automotive sector has no direct consequences for Ford's unit Volvo Car Corporation, a spokeswoman for the Swedish subsidiary said on Friday. 

 Sweden on Thursday presented its own measures, including up to 25 billion Swedish crowns ($3.1 billion) in emergency loans and credit guarantees to aid the nation's auto industry. "This does not directly affect us. The Swedish government presented its package yesterday and that is what matters for us," said Maria Bohlin, spokeswoman at Volvo Cars. Sweden's Industry Minister Maud Olofsson told local news agency TT on Friday that Sweden's aid package will not be revised as a result of the United States' senate's decision.
