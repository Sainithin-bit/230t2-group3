 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices fell in November as energy costs slumped for a fourth consecutive month, government data showed on Friday, providing further evidence that price pressures were abating sharply. 

 The Labor Department said the producer price index fell 2.2 percent, also posting its fourth straight monthly decline. The index had dropped 2.8 percent in October, which was the biggest monthly decline on record. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a 2.0 percent fall in the headline number. Compared to the same period last year, the index rose 0.4 percent, the lowest reading since January 2007, braking sharply from a 5.2 percent increase in October. "Core PPI is a little bit of a surprise, but it's still pointing toward a deflationary environment, the likes of which we haven't seen in ages," said Peter Kenny, managing director at Knight Equity Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. The global economic downturn, spawned by the collapse of the U.S. housing market, has suppressed demand for oil and sent prices plunging. Economists fear the year-long U.S. recession coupled with plummeting raw materials prices could usher in a phase of disinflation, which could extend into deflation, and complicate the economic recovery process. Core producer prices excluding food and energy costs rose 0.1 percent in November, matching market expectations and slowing from October's 0.4 percent increase. Core producer prices were up 4.2 percent over the last 12 months. Energy prices slumped 11.2 percent in November while gasoline prices plunged a record 25.7 percent.
