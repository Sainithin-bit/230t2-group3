 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Friday laughed off the "Madame Non" nickname critics have given her over her European policies, saying "yes" had been her credo during climate and economic talks at an EU summit. 

 Merkel, who faces a general election next year, left the meeting with a mixed bag of gains and setbacks that might give some relief to German industry, but will also see Berlin pay more for climate measures in eastern Europe than it intended. "'Yes' has been the motto of the day," a smirking Merkel told a news conference at the end of the two-day meeting of European leaders, when asked about her "Madame Non" image. Merkel had raised concern among some EU partners ahead of the summit when she insisted that new climate plans must not hurt German industry and said Berlin could not afford to top up an economic stimulus package that countries such as France, Britain and the European Commission saw as too modest. Indicating a softer approach when arriving in Brussels, Merkel called Germany's 31-billion euro national stimulus package "a first step" and said Europe's largest economy was willing to consider doing more to help boost growth. "We already brought our package...And we're holding talks on whether we will need more," Merkel said. The chancellor also faces pressure at home from industry and her own conservatives to step up growth plans, but Merkel has made clear the government must strike a balance between measures to boost the economy and keeping a close watch on the budget. CLIMATE Merkel said she welcomed an agreement by European leaders to battle climate change, saying the deal proved the region's lead role on the issue and should encourage the incoming U.S. administration of President-elect Barack Obama to follow. To Berlin's relief, the climate deal exempts around 90 percent of industry from the cost of buying permits to emit CO2 from the EU's flagship emissions trading scheme (ETS). But the compromise also includes an arrangement under which Europe will pay east European states to accept changes that will punish their heavily polluting power sectors -- a mechanism Germany, as large contributing state, had sharply criticized. "I'm very happy we managed to come (to this agreement) and showed willingness to compromise," Merkel said. But environmentalists criticized Merkel, who only a year ago was labeled the "climate chancellor," when she pushed through deals to combat global warming within the EU and G8. "With the exceptions, the emissions trading scheme now looks like a swiss cheese," Green party leader Cem Oezdemir told N24 television. "There's not much left of the climate chancellor." European leaders postponed a decision on reduced value-added-tax rates on some services, another issue on which Germany is at odds with some of its European partners, saying they would let finance ministers deal with the issue by March. "We will approach this in a constructive way but also safeguard German interests," Merkel said. (Reporting by Kerstin Gehmlich; editing by  Ralph Boulton )
