 HAMBURG, Germany  (Reuters) - The collapse of a U.S. government bailout for the automotive sector makes the situation more difficult for General Motors but does not affect its German unit Opel, an Opel spokesman said on Friday. 

 Opel still has sufficient liquidity, he added. Opel has sought German government funding guarantees to help it weather tough market conditions. (Reporting by Jan Schwartz, Writing by Michael Shields)
