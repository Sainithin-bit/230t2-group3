 (Reuters) - European Union leaders backed on Friday a stimulus package worth around 1.5 percent of the 27-nation bloc's gross domestic product in a bid to limit the impact of the EU's sharp economic slowdown, or, in some cases, recession. 

 The package, proposed by the European Commission, envisages injecting 200 billion euros ($265.3 billion) into the 13 trillion euro economy, laid low by the worst financial crisis in 80 years that has made credit scarce for companies and consumers. The bulk of the money -- 1.2 percent of EU GDP -- is to come from national governments stimulating their economies. Germany,, France, Italy, Spain, Britain and the Netherlands have already unveiled their national programs to boost the economy. EU leaders also: -- backed the use of 30 billion euros by the European Investment Bank, the EU's lending arm, in 2009-2010 to help finance smaller companies in particular and for developing renewable energy and clean transport; -- put pressure on banks and financial institutions to make full use of the public money and guarantees given to them to maintain and support lending and pass on the large interest rate reductions made by central banks across the EU; -- committed to applying the guarantees for banks so that lending can resume properly to companies and people; -- called for the threshold that triggers a requirement for EU state aid approval to be more than doubled to 500,000 euros to help smaller companies. The European Commission is set to take a decision next week. -- failed to broker a deal on whether to prolong and make permanent reduced rates of value-added tax on local services. Instead, they asked their finance ministers to take a decision by March. -- will discuss in March how well the recovery plan is working and if further actions are necessary.
