 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The White House said on Thursday it would evaluate its options after negotiations collapsed in Congress to pass a $14 billion rescue package for ailing U.S. automakers. 

 "It's disappointing that Congress failed to act tonight," said White House spokesman Tony Fratto. "We will evaluate our options in light of the breakdown in Congress." He declined to say what those options included. The Bush administration has resisted Democrats' past demands to use some money from the $700 billion bailout package approved in October to help struggling financial institutions. Fratto said that the legislation was a way to use money that was already going to automakers and "presented the best chance to avoid a disorderly bankruptcy while ensuring taxpayer funds only go to firms whose stakeholders were prepared to make difficult decisions to become viable."
