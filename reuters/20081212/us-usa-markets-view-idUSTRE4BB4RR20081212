 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. consumer sentiment improved this month helped by falling gasoline prices, retail discounts and "tumbling" inflation expectations, but pessimism over the future tempered their enthusiasm, a survey showed on Friday. 

 KEY POINTS: * The Reuters/University of Michigan Survey of Consumers said its index of confidence for December rose to 59.1 from November's 55.3, as one-year inflation expectations fell to their lowest in five years. * That was the highest since September and contrary to economists' expectations of a fall to 54.8, according to the median of forecasts in a Reuters poll. * Sentiment remains depressed by historical standards. The University of Michigan confidence index dates back to 1952 and is still mired near the record low of 51.7 hit in May 1980. * Expectations declined for the third consecutive month, hitting their lowest since June. * One-year inflation expectations fell to 1.7 percent -- their lowest since July 2003 -- from 2.9 percent in November. COMMENTS: JACK ABLIN, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, HARRIS PRIVATE BANK, CHICAGO: "It's encouraging. The sentiment tends to lead retail sales by about six months. Any tick-up in sentiment is certainly a positive in my view." STEVEN WOOD, CHIEF ECONOMIST, INSIGHT ECONOMICS, DANVILLE, CALIFORNIA: "Despite this month's increase, household assessments of the economy are still mired at recessionary levels. The causes of consumers' pessimism are also dampening real consumer spending." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. equity indexes pare losses after better-than-expected data. BONDS: U.S. Treasuries pare gains. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar holds losses versus euro, yen.
