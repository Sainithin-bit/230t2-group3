 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Lawmakers are angry and individual investors are livid. But if mutual funds are mad, they sure aren't showing it. 

 The $9.6 trillion U.S. funds industry is keeping almost stoically silent through the worst financial crisis in 80 years, despite its tumbling assets and its customers loss of retirement savings. The silence is angering investors and some corporate governance activists, and potentially threatening chances of meaningful corporate reforms such as giving shareholders a voice on executive pay at companies. "This is the largest block of shareholders. If we can't count on them, then we really are in trouble," said Jackie Cook, founder of Fund Votes, a fund proxy-vote tracking firm based in Vancouver, Canada. "They just don't want to stick their necks out and ruffle management's feathers," Cook added. Mutual funds owned about a quarter of all outstanding stock of U.S. companies in 2007, according to the Investment Company Institute, the funds industry trade body. That puts them in a unique position to set governance standards at firms, yet they rarely bring that influence to bear. Two of the best-known stock funds, Fidelity's Magellan and Legg Mason's Value Trust, for example, had hardly a harsh word in their communications to investors in November for the financial sector firms that caused them heavy losses. "Most of the fund company reports that I've read just identify the problems generally. I haven't seen too many, 'Well, the management of ABC Corp really messed up' kind of comments," said Richard Bregman, chief executive of MJB Asset Management LLC, a New York-based investment advisory firm. Reflecting unhappiness with fund managers and fears over market conditions, investors pulled $136 billion out of U.S. stock and mixed-equity mutual funds in September and October, according to research firm Lipper Inc. Portfolio managers are inherently less forthcoming than marketing-focused bankers or analysts at banks and brokerages. Some fund companies expressly prohibit managers from talking about investments they may be buying or selling. Funds are also mostly "buy-and-hold" investors. They are not expected to be critical of their own picks and remain invested in them. "The conventional wisdom among (fund) managers is to say they would potentially either stay with management or they would get out," said Barry Barbash, a former director of investment management at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and now a partner at law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher. "HYPOCRITICAL" Rather than getting out, some fund companies scooped up more of the fallen financial-sector names, likely causing more pain for investors as the stocks dropped even further. American Funds, AllianceBernstein and Dodge & Cox, among other fund companies, bought more of Citigroup ( C.N ) in the quarter to September 30. Shares of Citigroup, the second-largest U.S. bank by assets, were trading on Friday at about $7.43, down 64 percent from September 30. Some of the biggest fund companies also have failed to support so-called "say on pay" resolutions that gave shareholders the right to cast nonbinding votes on the pay of top executives. According to data from Fund Votes, over the 12 months to June 30, none of the biggest funds supported the resolutions targeted at eight major U.S. banks. Many analysts have faulted lofty compensation and executive bonuses for encouraging risk-taking by financial firms and causing the credit crisis. The U.S. government has set executive pay restrictions in exchange for injecting capital into banks under the $700 billion bailout plan. AllianceBernstein Holding ( AB.N ), Dodge & Cox, Putnam Investments, Vanguard Group and State Street Corp ( STT.N ) were among fund firms that rejected all say on pay resolutions at the eight banks, according to Fund Votes. Fidelity Investments abstained from voting on any of the resolutions. American Funds and Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) funds voted against a majority of the proposals. But some of the smaller investors in banks differed. Franklin Templeton voted for all the proposals and T. Rowe Price ( TROW.O ), Legg Mason ( LM.N ) and BlackRock ( BLK.N ) voted for a majority of the proposals, according to Fund Votes. AllianceBernstein said the firm votes according to what it considers to be in the best interests of its portfolios and clients. Fidelity said it was not in favor of these proposals that target specific companies. American Funds said it will not comment on its voting and portfolio changes. Morgan Stanley said it has supported say on pay resolutions where it saw "significant problems in pay structure that have not been addressed". Vanguard, State Street, Dodge & Cox and Putnam either did not comment on the voting or did not return phone calls. One reason for the reluctance of fund companies to speak up against the financial sector is understandable -- they are, in some cases, owned by banks and insurers. "The Morgan Stanley fund manager is not going to come out and trash the financial services industry. They are part of the financial services industry," said Mercer Bullard, a professor at the University of Mississippi Law School and a mutual fund shareholder rights activist. "Many of them have a lot of affiliations that would make (criticism) a little hypocritical," Bullard added. Richard Ferlauto, director of pension and benefit policy for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, a union with 1.6 million members, said the silence of the funds sometimes was also due to conflicts of interest. Their stance on issues may be influenced by the retirement business of firms that fund companies handle, Ferlauto said. Money managers, he said, also have widespread "soft dollar" deals with financial firms, under which they pay inflated commissions to brokers for perks such as free stock research. "The small investor loses every time," Ferlauto added. (Additional reporting by  Jason Szep ; Editing by  Brian Moss )
