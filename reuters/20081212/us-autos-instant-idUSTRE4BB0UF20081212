 Senate negotiators failed late on Thursday to reach a compromise deal to bail out struggling U.S. automakers, effectively killing any chance of congressional action this year and sending financial markets sharply lower. 

 Some U.S. politicians, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, urged the White House to look at short-term aid to automakers via the TARP program or Federal Reserve loans. Asian stocks extended losses on the news, with automakers such as Toyota Motor Corp leading the declines, while the dollar slipped to the day's lows versus the yen. U.S. stock futures were down 3.8 percent. EIJI DOHKE, CHIEF FIXED-INCOME STRATEGIST, UBS SECURITIES, TOKYO "The report on the U.S. auto rescue failure casts a shadow on the revival of credit market troubles and it would reduce investor tolerance for risk. That means Japanese banks, a major buyer of JGBs, may become so cautious of taking risks and they could turn away even from building up holdings of the debt." ALEX FONG, CHIEF EXECUTIVE, HONG KONG GENERAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, BEIJING "Even if the auto makers had reached a deal it would only have delayed the problem, not solved it. But it's certainly bad news for export-oriented firms in both Hong Kong and China. Confidence will be dampened and exports like clothes and shoes will be hit hard." ERICH MERKLE, CONSULTANT, CROWE CHIZEK, GRAND RAPIDS, MICHIGAN "This is still kind of in the negotiation process, still some hope that we could see some modification to the bill to get it through. "A lot of folks would believe that the UAW hasn't given enough and that the American automakers cannot be economically viable with the difference in the labor rates between the Japanese automakers and the Big Three. "It's always possible that it could come out of the TARP too ... I think maybe he (Paulson) might be warming up to it if you start taking a look at the unemployment rate and the jobless numbers. "It's going to be very difficult for them not to file for bankruptcy. GM has probably got until January and I would suspect the next step would be that GM will provide a date and say that at this date we will file. "Ford can make it a little longer, but if GM goes down, it will be a very difficult situation for Ford. It becomes very questionable if the supply base shuts down ... it will be a very difficult situation even though Ford is in a much better, a much stronger position than the other two. "It's not just the automakers' stocks, you have to look at the broad index and the banks ... the auto industry will not implode in a vacuum, when it implodes it will spread from coast to coast." HIROYUKI FUKUNAGA, REPRESENTATIVE DIRECTOR OF INVESTRUST, TOKYO "If this causes the parts makers under the umbrella of the Big Three to go under that could disrupt the supply of parts to Japanese automakers producing in the U.S. And that would hamper their output plans. "One way some people choose to look at this is that it could eliminate competition from the U.S., leading to a concentration of power in the auto industry to Europe and Japan. But the reality is that this would probably lead to severe conditions for the Japanese automakers as well." SONG SANG-HOON, ANALYST, KYOBO SECURITIES, SEOUL "The decision is really bad, although it had been expected. The failure is expected to hit not only the auto industry but also the whole economy, both of which have been battered. That means a further economic slowdown, more crisis and a higher unemployment rate. All of that will hit the global auto sector." LEE SANG-HYUN, AUTO ANALYST, HANA DAETOO SECURITIES, SEOUL "It is really bad news for the South Korean stock market at a time when it had just managed to rebound from a deep trough on hopes that the U.S. economy would not slip into a serious recession and the U.S. auto industry would survive this financial crisis. "I believe that U.S. politicians would come up with ways to prevent the Big Three from going for Chapter 11 while asking for more compromises from automakers and unions." JOHN CHIU, FUND MANAGER, FUH HWA SECURITIES INVESTMENT TRUST, TAIPEI "The failure of the bailout came as a big disappointment for Asian investors. It means the U.S. economy and unemployment will deteriorate, hurting the global economy further." JOSEPH TAN, CHIEF ASIAN ECONOMIST, CREDIT SUISSE, SINGAPORE "I think it's a big setback because the markets have been waiting for this to pass. There was positive gains in equities over the past few days based on this. It is looking pretty bad for equity markets right now. The auto industry really needs this bailout and if they do go under, this will clearly push up unemployment figures...to 7 to 8 percent. What the failure of this deal does is that it will set back sentiment not only in the U.S., but also set back sentiment globally. There is going to be further risk aversion going forward." SHANE OLIVER, HEAD OF INVESTMENT STRATEGY, AMP CAPITAL INVESTORS, SYDNEY "The market was counting on some rescue package and it looks like that won't happen. It could cause a further setback to the market, though some of that is already reflected. It's not good news. If there is no assistance for the auto industry in the U.S., then GM and Chrysler could have to file for bankruptcy." ALVIN LIEW, SOUTHEAST ASIA ECONOMIST, STANDARD CHARTERED BANK, SINGAPORE "Everybody is a bit jittery. When you get news like this, there will be flight to safety, which is from emerging Asia to the dollar and yen. Asian equity markets are open so they are being hit. "There's significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar against emerging Asian currencies." TIM ROCKS, EQUITY STRATEGIST, MACQUARIE SECURITIES, HONG KONG: "It shouldn't come as a surprise that Asian equity markets are selling off today on the news of the U.S. auto bailout failure. There has been some excess optimism on the effects of fiscal stimulus packages, and the market has been volatile the whole year. For Asia, the major issue is how much damage is being down to earnings and balance sheets, and we won't know until February next year when companies announce their fourth-quarter earnings." SEAN TSANG, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, POLARIS SECURITIES, HONG KONG "I would be very surprised if the rescue package didn't go through eventually, it is a highly sensitive and politicized issue. "The (labor) union will play a much bigger role in the next round of give and take. Their participation is absolutely crucial for the success of the bailout plan." CHOI DAE-SIK, ANALYST, HI SECURITIES, SEOUL "If the bailout plan fails, the whole U.S. industry will collapse. Obviously Hyundai and Kia may not able to avoid suffering as well. "The U.S. government should pour money into the industry to prolong its carmakers' lives." MARKUS ROSGEN, ASIA-PACIFIC STRATEGIST, CITIGROUP, HONG KONG: "My view is that they will still get bailed out. I can't see them going out of business. The fact they might go to Chapter 11 does not have a great economic impact on Asia but it might have a bigger impact on the U.S. taxpayer. This will likely hit short-term sentiment more with Dow futures off a lot. "No one wants to be long the equity market over the weekend. But I don't think this a make or break for Asia."
