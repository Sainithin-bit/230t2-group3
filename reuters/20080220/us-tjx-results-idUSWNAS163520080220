 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - TJX Cos Inc ( TJX.N ) posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday, and the off-price retailer's fiscal 2009 outlook exceeded Wall Street's expectations, sending its shares up nearly 3 percent. 

 "We were extremely disciplined in managing inventories, which gave us the ability to buy into current trends and offer great brands and fashions at compelling values," Chief Executive Carol Meyrowitz said in a statement. Retail analysts agree that like other off-price retailers, TJX stands to benefit from a wider and more favorably-priced supply of products in the current economic downturn, where consumers have cut spending and hunt for bargains as they wrestle with higher costs and falling home values. TJX, which buys excess merchandise in bulk below wholesale prices, said that net profit for the fourth quarter ended January 26 was $301.1 million, or 66 cents per share, compared with $205.5 million, or 43 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding a benefit tied to the reserve it set aside for an earlier data breach, TJX earned 64 cents a share, a penny above analysts' average expectation, according to Reuters Estimates. Quarterly sales from continuing operations rose 8 percent to $5.5 billion. TJX expects to earn between 40 cents and 41 cents a share from continuing operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. The company forecast same-store sales to increase between 4 percent and 5 percent in the quarter. For the fiscal year ending January 31 2009, TJX expects to earn $2.20 to $2.25 a share from continuing operations. The forecast includes a 9 cents per share benefit from an extra week on the company's fiscal 2009 retail calendar, TJX said. Analysts expect it to earn 43 cents a share for the first quarter and $2.14 for the year. Its shares were up 2.9 percent at $30.58 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
