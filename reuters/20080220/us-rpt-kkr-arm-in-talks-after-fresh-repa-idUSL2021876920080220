 TOKYO  (Reuters) - KKR Financial Holdings ( KFN.N ), the listed affiliate of private equity group Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co KKR.UL, has delayed repayment of billions of dollars of commercial paper for the second time and begun a new round of talks with creditors, the Financial Times said on Wednesday. 

 The paper said KKR Financial Holdings said in a regulatory filing that it had begun talks with creditors and deferred repayment of a chunk of debt due last Friday. The report dragged Asian shares lower and dragged the dollar lower against the yen, traders in Tokyo said. KKR Financial Holdings is a leveraged investment vehicle that had borrowed in commercial paper markets to invest in home loans, the FT said. The move follows a $270 million bail-out of the leveraged investment vehicle last September, which saw founders Henry Kravis and George Roberts personally inject cash, the newspaper said in a report on its Web site.
