 KIRKSVILLE, Missouri  (Reuters) - The rise in U.S. consumer prices seen in January was not welcome but the numbers are not a reason for alarm, St. Louis Federal Reserve President William Poole said on Wednesday. 

 "It is going in the wrong direction...but it is creeping in the wrong direction, not galloping," he told reporters after delivering a speech here. "I think it is something that the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) has to watch, but I am not alarmed," he said. January CPI rose by 0.4 percent overall while the core number, which excludes food and energy prices, advanced 0.3 percent.
