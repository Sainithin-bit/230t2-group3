 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Office supplies maker Avery Dennison 
Corp ( AVY.N ) said on Tuesday higher inflation and slowing 
economies would hurt its 2008 results, predicting that European 
and Asian markets would slow in addition to a weaker U.S. 
market. 

  Offsetting price increases and productivity improvements 
will not materialize until later in the year, Avery Dennison 
said.  It estimated full-year earnings of $3.75 to $3.95 per 
share, excluding one-time items, below average Wall Street 
estimates of $4.03 per share. In April the company had cut its 
forecast to a range of $4 to $4.30 per share.  The lowered forecast came as the company posted a 7 percent 
increase in quarterly profit as demand in emerging markets 
offset U.S. and European weakness and rising raw material 
costs.  Second-quarter net income rose to $92.4 million, or 93 
cents per share, compared with $86.2 million, or 87 cents per 
share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected the company to 
earn $1 per share in the second quarter.  Sales rose 20 percent to $1.83 billion, ahead of an average 
forecast of $1.79 billion.  (Reporting by Nick Zieminski, editing by Mark Porter and
