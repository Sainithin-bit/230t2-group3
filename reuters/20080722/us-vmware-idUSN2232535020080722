 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Business software maker VMware Inc ( VMW.N ) issued a revenue outlook on Tuesday that fell far short of expectations, saying customers were delaying purchases or opting for smaller and shorter contracts due to a weak economy. 

 Shares of VMware tumbled 14 percent as the third-quarter forecast overshadowed the company's second-quarter results, which were in line with expectations. "In a word: disappointing," said Jefferies & Co analyst Katherine Egbert. "They might be trying to lower the bar for the new CEO." VMware shocked investors two weeks ago by cutting its full-year revenue target and replacing Chief Executive and Co-founder Diane Greene with former Microsoft Corp ( MSFT.O ) executive Paul Maritz. The shares have lost a third of their value since then. The company is facing increased competition from rivals like Microsoft, which have launched cheaper products. VMware executives said Microsoft's sales efforts have the potential to lengthen the period it takes VMware to close deals. "We are not aware of having lost any deals to them (Microsoft)," Chief Financial Officer Mark Peek said on a conference call. "But there is potential their marketing and sales efforts will slow decision cycles, while customers sort the facts out for themselves." VMware, which is majority owned by EMC Corp ( EMC.N ), said it expected to report third-quarter revenue of between $462 million and $468 million, far below the average analysts forecast of $497 million, according to Reuters Estimates. It also forecast full-year revenue growth of 42 percent to 45 percent, compared with its July 8 forecast of growth "modestly below" 50 percent. In 2007, VMware's revenue soared 88 percent. WEAK ECONOMY Despite talk of the greater competition, VMware primarily blamed the state of the economy for its weak outlook. Corporate customers are taking longer to sign enterprise license agreements, through which they buy large quantities of software over multiple years, Peek said. "We are convinced this is due to the uncertain economic conditions," he said. He also said that some of VMware's customers were signing smaller, shorter-term contracts rather than entering into larger enterprise license agreements. Maritz also said on the conference call that VMware would start giving away one of its software products, ESXi, to entice businesses to buy other programs in its software line. Over the past year, Microsoft, Citrix Systems Inc ( CTXS.O ), Oracle Corp ORCL.O and privately held Virtual Iron have introduced software that costs less than VMware's market-leading ESX line of server virtualization software. Virtualization allows one computer to perform the work of multiple machines, reducing energy costs, maintenance and other expenses. Shares of VMware, based in Palo Alto, California, fell to $32.50 in after-hours trade, from their New York Stock Exchange close of $37.97. The stock made its debut at $29 in August 2007 and reached a high of $125.25 in October of last year. VMware said its second-quarter net income increased to $52 million, or 13 cents per share, from $34 million, or 10 cents, a year earlier. Profit excluding items was 23 cents per share, in line with Wall Street expectations. Second-quarter revenue rose 54 percent to $456 million, compared to the average analyst forecast of $458.6 million. (Reporting by Jim Finkle; editing by Jeffrey Benkoe,  Gary Hill )
