 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp ( LMT.N ) said on Tuesday quarterly profit rose, as sales of its electronic defense systems and a one-time gain related to a sale of some land offset lower sales for its F-16 fighter jet program. 

 Lockheed, the world's biggest defense contractor, reported a second-quarter profit of $882 million, or $2.15 per share, compared with $778 million, or $1.82 per share, in the year-ago quarter. (Reporting by  Bill Rigby  and Steve Orlofsky)
