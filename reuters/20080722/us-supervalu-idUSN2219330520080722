 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Supermarket chain Supervalu Inc ( SVU.N ) on Tuesday posted higher quarterly earnings on fewer charges, but weak sales prompted it to cut its full-year profit forecast and shares fell 6 percent. 

 The third-largest U.S. grocery store operator is grappling with record fuel prices at the same time that cash-crunched consumers have been cutting grocery bills by trading down to lower-cost store brands and generic medicine. "This environment certainly is more volatile than we've had over a number of years," Supervalu Chief Executive Jeff Noddle said in a conference call. "The ongoing weakness in the economy combined with higher food and energy inflation has created conditions that make us take a more cautious view for the balance of the fiscal year," he said. Supervalu, whose chains include Albertsons, Jewel-Osco, Shaw's and Save-A-Lot, said profit was $162 million, or 76 cents a share, in the first quarter ended June 14 compared with $148 million, or 69 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts on average forecast 75 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Acquisition-related costs were 3 cents a share in the quarter compared with 8 cents a share a year earlier. Sales were flat at $13.3 billion as a 4.6 percent increase in supply chain services sales helped offset a 0.7 percent decline in retail food sales, the company said. The company noted that it faced more store openings by competitors such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ) in the quarter. Closely watched identical-store sales were down 0.9 percent for the quarter. Supervalu's identical-store sales figure includes results from outlets operating for four full quarters, including store expansions, and excludes fuel sales. Gross margin fell to 23 percent from 23.2 percent as more of its sales came from the supply chain services business, the company said. The Minneapolis-based company forecast full-year earnings of $3 to $3.16 a share, down from its previous forecast of $3.06 to $3.22 per share. The company now expects a 0.5 percent increase in identical store sales, down from its previous forecast of 1 percent to 2 percent. The company said there was no meaningful impact in the quarter from its promotion that offered free groceries to shoppers who put money from their tax rebate check on a Supervalu gift card. Separately, Supervalu called the recent launch of its Wild Harvest organic brand its most successful ever. Later this quarter, it plans to unveil a new brand of premium prepared meals. Supervalu shares were down $1.68 at $26.14 in midday trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Through Monday, the stock was down 26 percent year-to-date while larger rival Kroger Co ( KR.N ) was up 6 percent.
