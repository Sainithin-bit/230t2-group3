 (Reuters) - Baker Hughes Inc ( BHI.N ), an oilfield services company, said on Tuesday its second-quarter profit rose 8.4 percent, helped by a jump in oil and gas drilling. 

 The Houston company said profit in the quarter was $379.3 million, or $1.23 a share, compared with $349.6 million, or $1.09 a share in the same period a year earlier. The second-quarter net income includes a net charge of $40.3 million, or 13 cents a share, related to a litigation settlement. Revenue rose 18 percent to $3 billion.
