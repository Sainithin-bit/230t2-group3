 (Reuters) - Construction and mining equipment giant Caterpillar Inc ( CAT.N ) will increase prices by 5-7 percent on its products worldwide, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 

 In the filing, the company said the price increase would be effective January 2009, and includes adjustments to list prices and merchandising support. The price increase is the result of current industry factors as well as general economic conditions, the company said.
