 (Reuters) - Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEH.N hired Julian Cheong, a managing director at rival Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ), as co-head of its financial institutions group for Asia-Pacific, the Wall Street Journal said on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the situation. 

 Cheong, who left Goldman in May, is expected to start at Lehman by the end of August. Lehman's current Asia head of financial institutions, David Kim, will remain in his role and share the same title as Cheong, the paper said. Lehman had recently hired Patrick Lee from UBS AG ( UBSN.VX ) to head its southeast Asia practice and Sungwoo Park from Credit Suisse Group ( CSGN.VX ) to lead its investment banking coverage of South Korea, the paper said.
