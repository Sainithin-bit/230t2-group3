 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - The following is a summary of recent comments by Fed policy-makers: 

 * Denotes 2008 voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets U.S. monetary policy. * PHILADELPHIA FED PRESIDENT CHARLES PLOSSER, JULY 22: "To keep inflation expectations anchored means that monetary policy-makers will have to back up their words with actions. "We will need to reverse course. I anticipate the reversal will need to be started sooner rather than later." * MINNEAPOLIS FED PRESIDENT GARY STERN, JULY 18: "We can't wait until we clearly observe the financial markets at normal, the economy growing robustly, and so on and so forth. Our actions will affect the economy in the future, not at the moment. Forecasts play a critical role. "We're pretty well positioned for the downside risks we might encounter from here. I worry a little bit more about the prospects for inflation." KANSAS CITY FED PRESIDENT THOMAS HOENIG, JULY 16: "It will be important for the Federal Reserve to monitor inflation developments and inflation expectations closely, and to move to a less accommodative stance in a timely fashion. "When to begin this process, and how fast to move, will be difficult decisions. "While a 2-percent federal funds rate may be appropriate in a period of extreme economic weakness, if maintained for too long it could allow inflationary pressures to build over time." * FED CHAIRMAN BEN BERNANKE, JULY 16: "I couldn't agree with you more that inflation is a tax, and that inflation currently is too high and it's a top priority of the Federal Reserve to run a policy that's going to bring inflation to an acceptable level." "The housing market is really the central element of this (financial) crisis, and anything we can do to strengthen the housing market, to strengthen mortgage finance, would be beneficial" * FED CHAIRMAN BEN BERNANKE, JULY 15: "The possibility of higher energy prices, tighter credit conditions and a still-deeper contraction in housing markets all represent significant downside risks to the outlook for growth. At the same time, upside risks to inflation outlook have intensified lately." "Many financial markets and institutions remain under considerable stress, in part because the outlook for the economy, and thus for credit quality, remains uncertain. Helping the financial markets to return to more normal functioning will continue to be a top priority." "I think we're looking at the remainder of the year being probably positive growth but certainty not robust growth." SAN FRANCISCO FED PRESIDENT JANET YELLEN, JULY 10: "I am somewhat reassured by the recent data, which suggest that my biggest fears on the downside have, so far, been avoided. However, a few months of data don't make a trend." * FED CHAIRMAN BEN BERNANKE, JULY 8: "We are currently monitoring developments in financial markets closely and considering several options, including extending the duration of our facilities for primary dealers beyond year-end, should the current unusual and exigent circumstances continue to prevail in dealer funding markets." RICHMOND FED PRESIDENT JEFFREY LACKER, JULY 8: "It could happen that we find it necessary to raise rates even if unemployment is still rising and growth is still weak. "That is a possibility ... it is something that we need to be prepared to do." SAN FRANCISCO FED PRESIDENT JANET YELLEN, JULY 7: "On a continuum I would say things are shifting to somewhat more inflation risks. "The risks to inflation are likely not symmetric and they have definitely increased. We cannot and will not allow a wage-price spiral to develop." ST LOUIS FED PRESIDENT JAMES BULLARD, JULY 3: "It is hurting Fed credibility to say that we are trying to keep inflation low and stable, but at the same time we are not counting some of the prices that are going up at the most rapid pace." FOMC STATEMENT, JUNE 25: "Recent information indicates that overall economic activity continues to expand, partly reflecting some firming in household spending. However, labor markets have softened further and financial markets remain under considerable stress. Tight credit conditions, the ongoing housing contraction, and the rise in energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters. "The Committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year. However, in light of the continued increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities and the elevated state of some indicators of inflation expectations, uncertainty about the inflation outlook remains high. "The substantial easing of monetary policy to date, combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity, should help to promote moderate growth over time. Although downside risks to growth remain, they appear to have diminished somewhat, and the upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations have increased. The Committee will continue to monitor economic and financial developments and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability."
