 (Reuters) - H&R Block Inc ( HRB.N ) on Tuesday named Russ Smyth, a former head of Europe for McDonald's Corp ( MCD.N ), as its new president and chief executive officer effective Aug 1. 

 Smyth's appointment comes about eight months after former CEO Mark Ernst, who oversaw the tax preparer's failed subprime lending strategy, resigned in November last year. Health insurer Aetna Inc's ( AET.N ) former chief financial officer, Alan Bennett, had been named interim CEO at the time. H&R block had also said Bennett was not in the running to become permanent CEO. (Reporting by Varsha Tickoo in Bangalore; editing by Sue Thomas)
