 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc on Tuesday posted a nearly 19 percent fall in net profit, and net revenue short of lowered Wall Street expectations, as it faced a weakening economy and the distraction of Microsoft Corp's pursuit. 

 Net income for the second quarter fell to $131 million, or 9 cents per diluted share, from $161 million, or 11 cents per diluted share, in the year-earlier quarter. Excluding one-time items, profit was $139 million, or 10 cents per share, down from $163 million, or 12 cents per share, a year ago. Gross revenue rose 6 percent to $1.798 billion. Net revenue excluding off-the-top payments to affiliated Web sites who carry Yahoo advertising services rose 8 percent to $1.35 billion. Wall Street analysts, on average, were looking for profit excluding items of 10 cents per share and net revenue of $1.37 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Yahoo's earnings come a day after the Internet pioneer agreed to appoint activist investor Carl Icahn and two of his nominees to its board, ending a proxy battle and reducing the chances of immediately revisiting a Microsoft deal.
