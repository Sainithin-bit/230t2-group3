 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Shares of top Chinese PC maker Lenovo Group Ltd ( 0992.HK ) fell 5.02 percent after a broker downgrade and a sale of the company's shares by International Business Machines Corp's ( IBM.N ). 

 Shares of Lenovo were set to open at HK$5.3 on Tuesday, compared with its previous close of HK$5.58. JP Morgan downgraded Lenovo to neutral from overweight due to a near-term slowdown in revenue growth from weak China demand and a slower ramp-up of the U.S. consumer business. The downgrade came soon after U.S. computer giant International Business Machines Corp (IBM) ( IBM.N ) sold $77.3 million worth of Lenovo shares.  IBM sold 116.19 million shares, or a roughly 1.3 percent stake in Lenovo, at HK$5.19 each, the bottom of a range of HK$5.19 to HK$5.36 per share, a source close to the deal said.
