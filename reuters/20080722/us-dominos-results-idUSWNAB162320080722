 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Pizza delivery company Domino's Pizza Inc ( DPZ.N ) said on Tuesday that quarterly profit rose sharply from a year earlier, when it booked a large charge related to a recapitalization. 

 The Ann Arbor, Michigan-based company said second-quarter net income was $18.7 million, or 32 cents per share, compared to $2.3 million, or 4 cents per share, a year earlier. The company also cited gains on the sale of company-owned stores, which were partly offset by "continued challenges in the domestic environment and resulting domestic same store sales and supply chain volume decreases."
