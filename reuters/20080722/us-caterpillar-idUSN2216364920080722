 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Construction and mining equipment company Caterpillar Inc ( CAT.N ) said on Tuesday that its quarterly earnings rose a surprising 34 percent as strong sales in the developing world offset continued weakness in North America and creeping softness in Western Europe and Japan. 

 The company also raised its full-year sales and profit outlook, sending its shares up as much as 3.6 percent, even as it acknowledged that material costs would be significantly higher than forecast during the remainder of the year. "The good news is that the global industrial economy is still holding up very well," said Matt Collins, an analyst at Edward Jones. "But rising steel and commodity prices are a huge variable." Even as investors cheered the better-than-expected results, some analysts noted that a lower-than-expected tax rate accounted for a good chunk of the beat. "It's a good quarter, but it's not as strong as it looks," said Eli Lustgarten at Longbow Research. And while Caterpillar's latest quarterly results came in 20 cents a share better than expected, the company only lifted its full-year EPS guidance by 9 cents, suggesting a second half deceleration in sales and profits, analysts said. Alex Blanton, an analyst at Ingalls & Snyder, agreed and said that Caterpillar's EPS guidance for the second half implied a profit of $2.82 a share, down from $2.90 a share last year and $3.18 in the first half. Caterpillar, a component of the Dow Jones industrial average and a U.S. business bellwether, reported a second-quarter profit of $1.11 billion, or $1.74 a share, compared with $823 million, or $1.24 a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 20 percent to $13.64 billion. Analysts, on average, expected the Peoria, Illinois-based company to earn $1.54 a share on sales of $11.87 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. In North America, Caterpillar, the world's largest maker of earth-moving equipment, said economic conditions in construction and quarrying continued to deteriorate during the quarter, offsetting some improvements in commodity sectors. It characterized the downturn in U.S. housing as "the worst environment since the 1930s." The softness spread to nonresidential construction during the quarter as "banks tightened lending standards for commercial and industrial loans, property prices softened and vacancy rates increased," Caterpillar said. But strength in Asia, where machinery sales surged 50 percent during the quarter, more than offset weakness here and in Western Europe. "Given what's going on in North America, and the softness taking shape in Western Europe, it's pretty impressive," said John Kearney, an analyst at Morningstar. Caterpillar warned that higher steel and commodity prices would increase its material costs by as much as 3 percent this year -- double its estimate at the beginning of the year. The company said it continues to work with suppliers to reduce those material costs. But it also announced separately that it was raising prices 5 percent to 7 percent worldwide, effective January 2009. That price increase comes on top of another increase of up to 5 percent that Caterpillar announced earlier this year. But analysts said the prices would stick -- as long as global commodity boom continues. "A lot of the people who are buying their equipment are beneficiaries of the higher commodity prices," said Kearney at Morningstar. "So everybody knows what they're going through and they're willing to pay. Caterpillar shares were last up about 2.4 percent at $74.99 after trading as high as $75.87 earlier in the day. Options investors, meanwhile, sold calls and bought puts, according to Susquehanna Financial Group's market intelligence team. "The overall sentiment is that volatility has collapsed because Caterpillar came in better than expected and a wall of worry has been lifted," said Joe Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at online brokerage thinkorswim Inc. "People are cautiously optimistic as we continue forward." (Additional reporting by  Doris Frankel , editing by Phil Berlowitz)
