 STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - Telecom equipment maker Ericsson's chief executive, Carl-Henric Svanberg, said on Tuesday his firm had not seen evidence that revenue worries hitting Vodafone were more widespread among its other customers. 

 "Of course we're all looking for signs when ... the consumer is constrained from telecom spending," Svanberg said in an interview with Reuters Television. "We haven't seen such things on any other operators." Vodafone cut its revenue outlook on Tuesday as tougher economic conditions were forcing consumers to hold back from buying and using new handsets, sending its shares down as much as 16 percent and helping to push down Ericsson stock. "We haven't so far seen anything in our business that is impacted from the financial crisis," he said, noting North American business was up and Europe has been slow for some time. Svanberg said the firm wanted to be cautious in its outlook. "Price pressure and price competition have been quite tough. It's always tough in this industry, but even more so over the last years," he added.
