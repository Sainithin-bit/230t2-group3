 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) is at least five years away from manufacturing substantial numbers of plug-in electric vehicles for the mass market, an executive said on Tuesday. 

 "When we look at volumes, we're clearly at least five years away from starting what I would call the ramp from very small volumes to substantial volumes," Nancy Gioia, Ford's director of sustainable mobility technologies and hybrid vehicle programs, said in an interview. Ford is currently testing 20 plug-in versions of its Escape sport utility vehicles, Gioia said. (Reporting by  Nichola Groom ; editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)
