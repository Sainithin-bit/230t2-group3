 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Biogen Idec Inc ( BIIB.O ) on Tuesday reported a better-than-expected second-quarter profit as sales of closely watched multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri surged past Wall Street estimates, pushing its shares up more than 2 percent in pre-market trading. 

 The biotechnology company, which this month fended off activist investor Carl Icahn's attempt to place three hand-picked candidates on the board, posted a net profit of $206.6 million, or 70 cents per share, compared with a profit of $186.1 million, or 54 cents a share, a year ago. Excluding items, Biogen earned 91 cents per share, beating analysts' average expectations by 6 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Global sales of Tysabri, which Biogen co-markets with Irish drugmaker Elan Corp ( ELN.I ), nearly tripled to $200 million, easily topping Wall Street expectations of about $182 million. Biogen recognized revenue of $147 million from Tysabri sales. Tysabri this month celebrates the second anniversary of its relaunch after it was pulled from the market for a time over concerns of cases of a potentially fatal brain infection. With more than 31,000 patients on the drug, there have been no new confirmed cases of the infection since relaunch. "Tysabri sales were significantly above expectations, beating our above-consensus estimate of $190 million," JPMorgan analyst Geoff Meacham said in a research note. "The long-term Tysabri outlook continues to improve, with record patient adds in the second quarter and over 31,000 patients on commercial drug," Meacham added. Revenue for the quarter jumped 28 percent to $993 million, topping Wall Street estimates of $962.6 million. Biogen raised its full-year revenue forecast to $4 billion. Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Biogen said it now expects full-year earnings of above $3.50 per share, excluding items, up from its prior forecast of $3.25 to $3.45 per share. Sales of Biogen's older multiple sclerosis drug, Avonex, rose 14 percent to $527 million. Revenue from Rituxan, the non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and rheumatoid arthritis drug Biogen sells in a joint arrangement with Genentech Inc DNA.N, rose 21 percent to $279 million. The quarterly sales performance appears to justify shareholder confidence in Biogen's leadership. Icahn had accused Biogen management of bungling or sabotaging an effort to sell itself and lobbied shareholders heavily in an attempt to get his slate of directors elected to the board. Shareholders overwhelmingly voted for the company's slate of directors, handing Icahn a resounding defeat. Biogen shares rose 2.5 percent to $68.50 in pre-market trade from their Monday Nasdaq close at $66.85. Biogen shares are up about 17 percent this year, outperforming the American Stock Exchange Biotech Index .BTK, which is up 10 percent for the year.
