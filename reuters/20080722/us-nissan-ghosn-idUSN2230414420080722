 NASHVILLE, Tenn  (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co ( 7201.T ) does not expect U.S. auto sales to bounce back in 2009 after a sharp decline this year, Nissan Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn said on Tuesday. 

 Speaking to reporters, Ghosn said Nissan would adapt to the shift in U.S. vehicle buying patterns by shifting more production to more passenger cars equipped with fuel-efficient four-cylinder engines and cutting output of heavier trucks if current sales trends persist. "The market has changed dramatically," Ghosn said. He added: "For the past few weeks, it looked like the only car you could sell in the United States was a four-cylinder." Ghosn said Nissan expected industrywide U.S. sales to be near 14.3 million units in 2008, down from 16.15 million in 2007. Next year's tally would be about the same at 14.3 million, he said.
