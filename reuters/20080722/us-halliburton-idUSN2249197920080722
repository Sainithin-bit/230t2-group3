 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - Halliburton Co ( HAL.N ) said on Tuesday quarterly net earnings fell sharply from a year earlier, when it recorded a big gain from the separation of its KBR Inc ( KBR.N ) unit, but the company's operating profit met Wall Street expectations. 

 Halliburton, the second-largest oilfield services company behind Schlumberger Ltd ( SLB.N ), also said its outlook had brightened as high oil and gas prices prompt energy companies to spend more on drilling and production. "We have seen prices stabilize across all of our product lines in North America," Dave Lesar, Halliburton's chief executive officer told investors on a conference call. "Our customers increased drilling plants are providing us with a more robust outlook for our services in the second half of the year." Even so, steep declines in natural gas and crude oil prices on Tuesday weighed on the energy sector. Halliburton shares which traded only slightly lower early, slid 5 percent in early afternoon trading. "The long and short of it is it looks like a pretty solid quarter," said Jeff Spittel, oilfield services analyst with Natixis Bleichroeder. "Things have started to stabilize in the North American fracturing market, which is a positive." Still, analysts noted that Halliburton results only met expectations. By contrast, Halliburton's smaller rivals Baker Hughes Inc ( BHI.N ) and BJ Services Co BJS.N topped analyst estimates, sending their shares higher. Baker Hughes' second-quarter profit rose more than 8 percent. Its adjusted earnings were $1.36 per share, topping the analysts' consensus forecast of $1.24 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 18 percent to $3 billion. And shares of BJ Services soared more than 7 percent after the Houston company reported fiscal third-quarter earnings per share of 48 cents, well above the analyst consensus of 40 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. BIG GAIN Halliburton said second-quarter net income declined to $507 million, or 55 cents per share, from $1.5 billion, or $1.62 a share, a year earlier, when results included a $933 million gain from the separation of KBR. Halliburton split off KBR, its engineering and construction arm, last year in a bid to focus on growing its oilfield services business. Income from continuing operations rose to $623 million, or 68 cents per share, from $595 million, or 63 cents a share. On that basis, analysts had expected a profit of 68 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Consolidated revenue climbed 20 percent to $4.5 billion, exceeding analysts' expectation of $4.26 billion. Revenue outside North America, where Halliburton is focusing its growth efforts, increased 26 percent, the company said. On its conference call, Halliburton said it expects to see healthy growth in its international markets in 2009, along with continued profit margin expansion. Pricing declines in the company's U.S. pressure pumping market, which has been dogged by overcapacity, eased in the quarter and are expected to firm or improve, Halliburton said. Operating income for the company's completion and production business rose 1 percent to $561 million, with growth tempered by pricing declines in the United States and higher costs. Revenue rose to $2.44 billion from $2.07 billion. In Halliburton's drilling and evaluation unit, operating income climbed 38 percent to $480 million and revenue jumped to $2.05 billion from $1.67 billion. Halliburton shares fell $2.57 to $46.34 in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. BJ Services rose $1.97, at $31.98 and Baker Hughes was up 2.3 percent, or $1.95, at $86.31.
