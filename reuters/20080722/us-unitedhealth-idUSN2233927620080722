 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - UnitedHealth Group Inc ( UNH.N ) on Tuesday reported a 72 percent drop in quarterly profit on a big charge from a legal settlement and challenges in its businesses serving seniors and employers, although its results surpassed previously lowered expectations. 

 The largest U.S. health insurer by market value also declared its shares undervalued and offered no negative surprises -- relief for investors who have endured a bevy of earnings warnings this year from the industry. Beaten-down shares of UnitedHealth rose more than 9 percent, and its report lifted shares of rival health insurers. "There's no other shoes to fall, so they're rallying on that," said Edward Jones analyst Aaron Vaughn. Health-insurer shares have plummeted this year on disappointing earnings forecasts stemming from a variety of setbacks. Even with Tuesday's rally, the Morgan Stanley Healthcare Payor index .HMO is down 38 percent this year. UnitedHealth, the first health insurer to report, has been the group's laggard, with its shares down 59 percent this year through Monday. Chief Executive Stephen Hemsley called the shares "undervalued and compelling," and the company said it would continue buying back its stock, with more than $3 billion in repurchases planned for 2008. The company also said it would consider raising its dividend once its shares rebound. THE NUMBERS For the quarter, net earnings fell to $337 million, or 27 cents per share, from $1.23 billion, or 89 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, UnitedHealth earned 67 cents per share, 2 cents ahead of the analysts' average forecast, according to Reuters Estimates. Earlier this month, UnitedHealth estimated earnings for the quarter at 64 cents to 66 cents per share, excluding special items, far below analysts' forecasts at the time. Second-quarter revenue rose 6.7 percent to $20.3 billion. Earnings from operations at its main health-care benefits unit fell 35 percent to $1.14 billion. Pressure in its commercial business serving employers -- where the company has cited tough competition -- hurt margins and enrollment. Membership in the company's plans for which it assumes full insurance risk fell by 95,000 from the first quarter to about 10.5 million members. Vaughn said the company soothed some concerns by maintaining it would not cut pricing to grab market share, despite enrollment losses. Profitability in the company's Medicare business for seniors also was under pressure, as the company offered overly attractive plans to seniors with special needs. The company's consolidated medical care ratio, which measures the portion of premiums spent on medical costs, worsened to 83.2 percent from 80.3 percent a year ago. Overall, the Minneapolis-based company provided medical benefits to 32.68 million members at the end of the quarter. The company said it still expects full-year adjusted earnings per share of $2.95 to $3.05. UnitedHealth lowered the outlook earlier this month, marking the second such reduction to initial 2008 expectations. The company earlier this month agreed to pay more than $900 million to settle lawsuits related to past stock options practices. The legal settlements brought it closer to moving past a scandal over the manipulation of stock option dates that led to the 2006 departure of William McGuire as chief executive. UnitedHealth shares rose $2.26, or 9.5 percent, to $26.09 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. (Editing by  Brian Moss  and Lisa Von Ahn)
