 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc Chief Executive Ivan Seidenberg, in a television interview on Tuesday, reiterated the company's goal to close its planned acquisition of Alltel by the end of the year. 

 "The end of the year looks like a good target," he said on CNBC. Verizon Wireless, a venture of Verizon and Vodafone Group Plc, plans to buy rural mobile phone service provider Alltel Corp for $28.1 billion, including debt, which would vault it to first place in the U.S. market, ahead of AT&T Inc.
