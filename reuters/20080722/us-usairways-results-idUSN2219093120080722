 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - US Airways Group ( LCC.N ) posted a quarterly loss on Tuesday, reversing a year-earlier profit, on soaring fuel prices. 

 The carrier said its second-quarter net loss amounted to $567 million, or $6.16 per share, compared with a profit of $263 million, or $2.77 per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time charges US Airways, which formed in 2005 from the merger of America West and the former US Airways, said it posted a loss of $101 million, or $1.11 per share. On that basis the company had been expected to lose $1.29 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Operating revenue rose 3.2 percent to $3.26 billion. The carrier paid $1.09 billion for fuel in the second quarter, an increase of 65.1 percent from a year ago. US airlines have been punished this year by skyrocketing fuel costs that have outpaced a series of fare hikes that began in 2006. Carriers are responding with sweeping cuts to capacity and staff. US Airways, which previously announced capacity cuts to offset its fuel bill, said on Tuesday it would reduce its fourth quarter and 2009 capacity by an additional one to two percent. That brings total capacity cuts to 4 percent to 6 percent for the fourth quarter and for 2009. The company reported a $622 million non-cash charge to write off goodwill. The elimination of goodwill stems from record high fuel prices. The company also reported a non-cash charge of $18 million related to the decline in the fair market value of some assets associated with its fleet. The company ended the quarter with $2.8 billion in total cash and investments, of which $2.3 billion was unrestricted. (Reporting by Kyle Peterson, editing by Gerald E. McCormick and  Derek Caney )
