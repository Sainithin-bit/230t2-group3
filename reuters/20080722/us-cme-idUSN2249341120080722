 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - CME Group Inc ( CME.O ) on Tuesday posted a quarterly profit that beat Wall Street estimates as lower-than-expected expenses offset weaker volume in interest rate contracts, its biggest business segment. 

 CME shares jumped more than 6 percent to a two-week high as company officials expressed confidence that financial market woes that have hurt trading volume were short-term in nature. "The ongoing credit crisis (has) impacted certain interest rate trading strategies. We view this as a cyclical slow down, rather than a long-term issue," Craig Donohue, CME's chief executive, said on a conference call with analysts. Excluding costs related to CME's 2007 purchase of the Chicago Board of Trade and other items, profit rose to $215 million, or $3.93 per share, from $194 million, or $3.52 per share, a year before. On that basis, analysts on average had expected earnings of $3.85 per share. "We see a slight positive on the modest EPS beat (but) don't expect the beat to meaningfully drive the consensus higher," said Edward Ditmire, analyst with Fox-Pitt Kelton in New York. Revenue rose 71 percent on the year to $563 million, matching analysts' expectations, but was down 10 percent from the first quarter. "Expenses were better than recent guidance had suggested," Richard Repetto, analyst at Sandler O'Neill in New York, said in explaining CME's stronger than expected results. At $213 million, expenses excluding special items were below estimates from CME Group on July 1 that operating expenses would be $218 million to $221 million, Repetto noted. CME said on Tuesday that operating expenses for the full year should be closer to the bottom end of its previous $855 million to $870 million forecast. CME's quarterly futures and options trading volume was previously reported as up 7 percent from 2007, slower growth than the giant Chicago-based exchange has seen in recent years. Turnover in interest rate contracts, CME's largest product line, slipped 3 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier. So far in July, in what is normally a slower trading period, daily volume has averaged about 1 million contracts a day more than in the second quarter, he said. "CME acknowledged investor concerns over the interest rate franchise ... this is incrementally more accepting of the trend than last quarter, where management said growth was not slowing," said Fox-Pitt's Ditmire. The shift in trading mix away from interest rate contracts helped boost CME's average rate per contract, a key measure of margins, to 64.8 cents from 63 cents in the first quarter and 63.9 cents in last year's second quarter. CME's operating margin was 62 percent against 59 percent for the same period in 2007. NYMEX FINANCING COMES THROUGH Separately, CME said it had secured $3.2 billion of financing from Bank of America and UBS for its planned acquisition of NYMEX Holdings Inc, the big energy and metals exchange. CME officials told analysts that the revised terms announced on Friday should help secure NYMEX member and shareholder approval in a vote scheduled for Aug 18. The financial framework of the proposed takeover was left unchanged, but higher payments were announced for NYMEX members along with a much smaller "golden parachute" for top NYMEX officials. "I have received a number of calls ... indicating strong support for the revised agreement," Donohue said. CME shares jumped to $346.54, up $21.01 or 6.5 percent. NYMEX rose 3.2 percent or $2.46 to $79.49. (Editing by Steve Orlofsky)
