 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Washington Mutual Inc, the largest U.S. savings and loan, on Tuesday posted a $3.33 billion second-quarter loss, boosting its reserve for loan losses as the number of soured mortgages soared. 

 The net loss equaled $6.58 per share, reflecting a one-time adjustment related to the Seattle-based thrift's capital issuance in April. Excluding that change, Washington Mutual said it lost $3.34 per share, compared with a profit of $830 million, or 92 cents per share, a year earlier.
