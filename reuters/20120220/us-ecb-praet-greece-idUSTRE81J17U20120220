 GENEVA  (Reuters) - The European Central Bank will do what is necessary in line with its mandate of maintaining price stability if the situation in Greece takes a turn for the worse, ECB Executive Board member Peter Praet said on Monday. 
 Asked whether the ECB had a contingency plan if Greece exited the euro zone, Praet said: "The central bank always does what it feels necessary given its mandate." He did not want to comment further on any specific plan. (Reporting By  Eva Kuehnen  and  Stephanie Nebehay ; Editing by  Andrea Ricci )
