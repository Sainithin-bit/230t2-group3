 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - European Union trade chief Karel De Gucht said on Thursday a WTO trade panel ruling found Boeing had received huge illegal subsidies from the U.S. government, and that such support had caused substantial harm to EU interests. 

 "This WTO panel report clearly shows that Boeing has received huge subsidies in the past and continues to receive significant subsidies today," De Gucht said in a statement. "The United States began this dispute in 2004 and now finds itself with a crystal-clear ruling that exposes its long-running multi-billion dollar subsidization of Boeing through federal and state programs as illegal," he said. "These subsidies have resulted in substantial harm to EU interests, causing Airbus to lose sales, depress its aircraft prices and unfairly lose market share to Boeing." De Gucht called on the United States to work with the European Union on a mutually agreed solution to the six-year battle over state support for the industry's two giants.
