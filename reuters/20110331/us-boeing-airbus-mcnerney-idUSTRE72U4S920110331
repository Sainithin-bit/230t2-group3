 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The United States has won a "dramatic victory" in a dispute with the European Union over government support for aircraft manufacturers, the chairman of Boeing said on Thursday. 

 A new World Trade Organization ruling shows that Boeing has received far less government aid than what was found for Airbus in a previous WTO ruling, Boeing Chairman and President Jim McNerney said at the U.S. Export-Import Bank's annual conference. "This was a dramatic victory for clarifying the rules of engagement for developing countries as they start developing products like aircraft," McNerney said. "We're very hopeful that that will help us with the Chinese, as they start supporting their efforts." (Reporting by  Doug Palmer ; Editing by  Andrea Ricci )
