 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Ally Financial filed for an initial public offering that will allow the U.S. government to sell down its majority stake in the bailed-out auto and mortgage lender. 

 The company filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday to raise up to $100 million, but the IPO ultimately could bring between $6 billion and $7 billion, including common stock and convertible securities, sources previously told Reuters. Filing for a smaller amount initially allows an issuer to evaluate market conditions closer to the time of the IPO, a common practice for big deals. When General Motors Co ( GM.N ) first filed its IPO paperwork with the SEC, it said it expected to raise up to $100 million. Including overallotments, GM ultimately raised $23.1 billion. Ally, formerly known as GMAC, was once a unit of General Motors. The IPO will be the latest in a handful of offerings by government-rescued companies that include GM and insurer American International Group Inc ( AIG.N ), which is preparing to sell more than $10 billion in stock in mid-May. U.S. taxpayers bailed out Ally multiple times in 2008 and 2009, investing more than $17 billion in cash. The U.S. Treasury Department now owns a 73.8 percent stake in the company. Private equity firm Cerberus CBS.UL is another Ally stakeholder, with 8.7 percent. GM owns 4 percent of Ally directly and 5.9 percent through a trust. Ally's filing comes on the same day that the Federal Reserve released the names of other banks and companies that borrowed from its main emergency lending facility during the financial crisis. Citigroup Inc ( C.N ), Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ), JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ) and Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) were listed as the lead underwriters on the offering. The filing did not specify the number of shares in the offering, the price range, or the exchange on which they will trade.
