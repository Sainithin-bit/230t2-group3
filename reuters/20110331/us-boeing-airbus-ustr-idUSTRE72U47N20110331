 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A trade ruling released on Thursday shows Boeing currently receives about $2.7 billion in government subsidies, but that is "dwarfed" by $20 billion European support that Airbus has received over the years, the top U.S. trade official said on Thursday. 

 U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk told reporters the World Trade Organization ruling "vindicated" the longtime U.S. position that any support for Boeing is minuscule compared to European government support for Airbus. Kirk said a previous WTO report show Airbus had consistently received subsidies in the form of low-interest "launch aid loans" and repeated the U.S. demand that European government refrain from loans "of a similar nature" for future Airbus projects.
