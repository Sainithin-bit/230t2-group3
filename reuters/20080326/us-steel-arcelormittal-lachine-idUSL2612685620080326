 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - ArcelorMittal ( ISPA.AS ) ( MT.N ), the world's largest steelmaker, is closing down its Canadian Lachine wire mill and cutting 100 jobs because of falling demand for wire and the rise of the Canadian against the U.S. dollar. 

 The company said in a statement on Wednesday it would move 53 of the total 153 jobs at the Lachine plant to its Saint-Patrick facility. Both plants are near the city of Montreal. "The Lachine and Saint-Patrick wire mills have both been operating at less than 50 percent capacity since the beginning of 2007," said Alain Robitaille, General Manager of ArcelorMittal's Wire Group. "This situation entails high production costs in the North American wire market where supply has been consistently exceeding demand since the early 2000s," he said.
