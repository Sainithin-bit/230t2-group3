 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A senior U.S. lawmaker said on Wednesday that there is a "critical need" to modernize the country's financial services regulations, which have been criticized amid the subprime mortgage crisis and near collapse of investment bank Bear Stearns BSC.N. 

 Sen. Jack Reed, chairman of the Senate securities, insurance and investment subcommittee, said one issue is whether regulators need greater authority. He indicated, however, that he does not favor creating a single financial regulator. "It requires not only reviewing the authority of individual regulators, but also reviewing the way they undertake regulation," Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, told Reuters in an interview. "I think there should be a moment of soul-searching among all the regulators about what they have done in the last several months and years and how they can improve dramatically their regulation." Lawmakers have been grappling with the fallout from the mortgage crisis and have questioned whether there was adequate oversight of the mortgage lenders, financial institutions and credit rating agencies, which have all played a role. Rep. Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat and the chairman of the powerful House Financial Services Committee, has called for the creation of a new agency or the U.S. Federal Reserve to monitor all risk in the financial system after the near implosion of Bear Stearns. Lawmakers have introduced legislation to help families avoid foreclosure and keep their homes. The Federal Reserve has cut interest rates dramatically in an effort to avoid a recession and financial market meltdown. "This is a very serious situation," said Reed. "There is still a huge uncertainty in the market place. As a result, we don't have the luxury of sitting around and waiting until things settle down. We have to get to work." Reed said the first priority would be to get the regulators "to tell us what happened and what they think were the lapses. Do they need more authority? What was the assumption that turned out to be wrong? Are there things we can do?" Asked if there should be a single regulator for financial services like the UK's Financial Services Authority, Reed said; "I don't think so... My experience around here is creating new institutions out of old institutions is not a costless process." REED QUESTIONS OVERSIGHT OF BEAR STEARNS Reed questioned the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's oversight of U.S. investment banks Bear Stearns, Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ), Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEH.N, Merrill Lynch & Co Inc MER.N and Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ). The SEC oversees only these five banks because they have a large broker-dealer component and large securities component, unlike other investment banks. The SEC's supervisory program allows the agency to respond quickly to any financial and operational weakness in the companies. However, the agency has been criticized for not seeing liquidity or capital problems in the investment banks. "I have serious questions," Reed said. "How thoroughly are they looking at the books? Are they stress testing?" Earlier this month, Bear Stearns was forced to seek emergency funding after its clients refused to do business with the investment bank, causing its liquidity position to deteriorate significantly. With support from the Fed and the Treasury Department, Bear Stearns has agreed to be sold to JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ) for about $10 a share. As part of the deal, the Fed agreed to guarantee up to $29 billion of Bear Stearns' assets. Bear stock closed up 2.5 percent at $11.21 on the New York Stock Exchange. JPMorgan fell 4 percent at $44.11. (Editing by Leslie Adler)
