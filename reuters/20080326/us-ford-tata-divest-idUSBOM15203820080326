 MUMBAI  (Reuters) - India's Tata Motors Ltd ( TAMO.BO ) will divest stakes in various units to help finance the deal to buy luxury brands Jaguar and Land Rover from Ford Motor Co ( F.N ), its chief financial officer said on Wednesday. 

 "Tata Motors is also reviewing an undertaking, putting in place a disinvestment program, unlocking value from some of our investments in various subsidiaries," C. Ramakrishnan told a teleconference after the $2.3 billion deal was announced. "That plan is getting finalized and one or two actions are already in place," he said, without elaborating. Tata Motors ( TTM.N ), India's top bus and truck maker, will buy luxury brands Jaguar and Land Rover for about $2.3 billion in cash. "The funding will be done through existing cash resources and new debt facilities which will be raised at Tata Motors level," a company spokesman said in a statement. "We already have committed financing from our banks which along with our existing cash resources is sufficient." (Reporting by Hiral Vora; Editing by  Charlotte Cooper )
