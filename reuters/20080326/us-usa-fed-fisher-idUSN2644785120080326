 WACO, Texas  (Reuters) - Dallas Federal Reserve President Richard Fisher on Wednesday warned about the risk of inflation as policy-makers cut interest rates to protect the economy, and he said the Fed should assume oversight of investment banks. 

 Opening the liquidity "faucet" to stem weakness in the economy stemming from the housing crisis could risk increasing inflation, Fisher told a community forum in Waco, Texas. He was referring to a spate of emergency steps the Fed has taken to prevent the financial system from seizing up. "If we again begin to grow, at a time when inflation is still at a very high base level, then we could (create) conditions for sustainable inflation over the long term," said Fisher, who voted against the last two Fed rate cuts because of his worry over price pressures. "The priority focus should be figuring out new ways to enhance liquidity, reduce the fear that people have as counter-party risk," he said. As well as rate cuts, the Fed has offered to pump billions of dollars directly to U.S. primary dealers to ensure capital markets keep operating, as part of the measures drawn up around the rescue of ailing investment bank Bear Stearns BSC.N. "We recently opened up our window to lend to what are called primary dealers," Fisher said. "I fully expect that in return for that we will get regulatory authority to actually oversee those dealers, to make sure the people we're lending money to are adhering to the principles of good financial behavior," he said. Primary dealers are currently overseen by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has been attacked by some U.S. politicians for having too light a touch. The Fed has slashed interest rates 3 percentage points to 2.25 percent since mid-September to battle a financial crisis sparked by the collapse of the subprime mortgage market that many fear has tipped the economy into recession. Fisher said these problems would prove a temporary setback to confidence but acknowledged the economy was "anemic". "We are slowing down. We are in for a prolonged period of slowdown because of the excess speculation that took place in housing. ... and the fact that liquidity ... is not getting out to the system as regularly as it should," he said. On the other hand, there was no ignoring the rising price pressure and the danger that these become entrenched into expectations for the future. "Consumer price inflation is rising, and the personal consumption expenditure basket is rising to uncomfortable levels," Fisher said. "What we are trying to do ... is condition expectations of where we go, going forward, to make sure that inflation doesn't get out of control. Because we know that there is a lag in monetary policy," he said. "That is the dilemma we are currently faced with. (Reporting by Ros Krasny and  Alister Bull ; Editing by Frank McGurty)
