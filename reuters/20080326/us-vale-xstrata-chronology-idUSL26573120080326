 (Reuters) - Mining group Xstrata XTA.L and suitor Vale ( VALE5.SA ) of Brazil said on Tuesday that long-running takeover talks had collapsed after the two sides failed to reach a deal. 

 Here is a chronology tracing the main events in the bidding for Anglo-Swiss group Xstrata. December 5, 2007 - Xstrata Chief Executive Mick Davis tells an investor presentation that BHP Billiton's ( BHP.AX )( BLT.L ) move to acquire Rio Tinto ( RIO.AX )( RIO.AX ) was likely to lead to another wave of mergers in the sector. December 12 - Xstrata confirms, after a wave of rumors, that it held preliminary talks about possible mergers but says they resulted in no proposals. January 21, 2008 - Vale ( RIO.N ) says it held talks with Xstrata about a takeover, but cautions that any deal would depend on market conditions. January 25 - Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula says he is yet to discuss Vale's possible bid for Xstrata. A senior government official says the government opposes such a move. February 7 - Brazil's state development bank says it sees no reason to oppose Vale's attempt to buy Xstrata, signaling that the bid is unlikely to be blocked by the government. February 12 - The Financial Times says Xstrata and its 35 percent shareholder Glencore rejected a cash-and-shares proposal worth just under 40 pounds a share, which could lead Vale to walk away. Feb 21 - About eight banks are backing Vale's planned bid for Xstrata with an estimated $50 billion financing package, sources say. Feb 29 - Vale's CEO says the firm has reached its limits in Xstrata talks, saying any future deal depended on Xstrata's main shareholder Glencore and its stance over marketing rights. March 3 - Xstrata posts 13 percent rise in 2007 net profit, fuelled by record output, and says it is still scouting for acquisitions during takeover talks with Vale. March 10 - A drop in the share price of Vale relative to Xstrata throws up another obstacle in the way of any deal between the two mining groups, a source says. March 17 - Meetings in Brazil between top brass of Vale, Xstrata and Glencore made little progress toward a takeover, Brazilian media say. March 25 - Vale and Xstrata say talks collapse after failure to reach a deal. (Reporting by  Eric Onstad ; Editing by  Gary Hill )
