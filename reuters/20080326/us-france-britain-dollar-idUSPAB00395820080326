 PARIS  (Reuters) - President Nicolas Sarkozy has questioned whether France and Britain could not work together to put pressure on the United States to strengthen the dollar. 

 Sarkozy starts a 2-day state visit to Britain later on Wednesday and in an interview with the BBC, he said the two countries could combine forces in many areas. "For example, regarding the economy, could we not together press our American friends so that the dollar climbs," Sarkozy said, according to a transcript of the interview released by the Elysee Palace.
