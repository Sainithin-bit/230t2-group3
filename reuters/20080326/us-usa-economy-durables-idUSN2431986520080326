 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Orders for U.S. durable goods should post a slight recovery for February owing to a rise in aircraft orders, according to a Reuters poll, but business investment remains subdued as the economy struggles against the head winds of recession. 

 The durable goods data comes after the Institute for Supply Management already reported the manufacturing sector contracted in February, so economists' optimism is limited to a monthly boost on the back of the aircraft sector. Economists surveyed by Reuters predicted Wednesday's report would show overall orders for long-lasting U.S.-made manufactured goods rose 0.8 percent in February, rebounding from January's fall of 5.1 percent. The 54 estimates ranged from a decline of 1.5 percent to a 3.0 percent rise in durable goods, which tend to be volatile from month to month and can see wide swings in particular due to aircraft orders at industry giant Boeing ( BA.N ). As a gauge of underlying business investment, economists predicted non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft would register a decline of 0.1 percent after a fall of 1.5 percent in January. The durable goods report is due at 8:30 a.m. (1230 GMT) on Wednesday. The following is a selection of economists' forecasts and comments: ACTION ECONOMICS Forecast: +1.5 pct "February durable goods orders are expected to rebound 1.5 percent, while shipments fall 0.5 percent. Inventories are expected to increase 0.1 percent, which would leave the inventory/sales ratio at 1.50 from 1.49. Aircraft orders should be a big boost on the month, given that Boeing orders jumped to 125 planes from 65 planes in January. Aircraft should also provide a boost to shipments, with Boeing shipments rising to 39 planes from 34 planes. But, other data suggest downside risk on the month." BNP PARIBAS Forecast: +1.5 pct "In January, durable goods orders declined 5.1 percent month/month, driven by aircraft. Boeing orders plunged to 65 planes in January after a record 287 planes were ordered in December, causing non-defense aircraft to fall by over 30 percent. In February, Boeing orders rebounded to 125 planes, just above the 119 monthly orders recorded on average over 2008. Stronger aircraft orders will inevitably boost total durable goods, which are forecast to increase by 1.5 percent month/month in February. Despite this rebound, the underlying trend in new durable goods orders should continue to weaken." MERRILL LYNCH Forecast: +3.0 pct "New orders of durable goods probably rebounded in February, rising about 3.0 percent month on month after a sharp 5.1 percent decline in January. Much of the increase will be driven by strong non-defense aircraft orders, as evidenced by the more than 30 percent increase in Boeing's order flow." "The key non-defense capital goods ex aircraft component, which is a proxy for capex, will probably slip 0.1 percent -- taking annualized quarterly momentum to 7.0 percent from 7.3 percent." UBS Forecast: -1.0 pct "Durable goods orders probably fell again in February, consistent with a weakening trend in manufacturing surveys. We expect a fairly broad-based decline, including in the key non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft series ("core" capital goods). The decline in those capital goods orders in January reversed only part of the rise in December. "Although we believe the economy is in recession, we expect the recession to be mild by past standards for the manufacturing sector: the drag from inventories is likely to be much more modest than in past downturns."
