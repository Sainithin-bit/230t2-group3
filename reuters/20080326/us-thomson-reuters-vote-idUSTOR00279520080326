 TORONTO  (Reuters) - Shareholders of electronic publisher Thomson Corp TOC.TOTOC.N have approved its takeover of financial news and data provider Reuters Group Plc RTR.L. 

 About 99 percent of the votes cast on Wednesday were in favor of the deal. The vote in Toronto was a formality as Woodbridge Co Ltd, the investment vehicle of the Thomson family, which owns 70 percent of Thomson's shares, had already said it was behind the transaction.
