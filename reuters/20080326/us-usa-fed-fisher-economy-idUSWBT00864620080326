 WACO, Texas  (Reuters) - Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Richard Fisher said on Wednesday that the U.S. economy could remain "anemic" for longer than originally thought. 

 Consumers are facing some headwinds at present, including rising food prices and high gasoline prices, that could continue to drag on growth for some time, he said. However, Fisher, speaking to reporters after a speech to a local business group, said he is not using the term "recession" to describe the economy. Fisher, one of two dissenters against the Fed's decision in March to slash benchmark interest rates by 75 basis points, said the outcome of that meeting struck "a fairly good balance" in representing policy-makers' different views.
