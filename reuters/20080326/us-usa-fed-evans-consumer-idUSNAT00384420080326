 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. consumer has been remarkably "resilient" to date, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said on Wednesday. 

 Evans, speaking on the economic outlook before the New York Association for Business Economics, also said that given the current employment situation, there will be "challenges" for U.S. consumers on incomes and household wealth based on equity values. The Federal Open Market Committee has lowered its benchmark federal funds rate by 300 basis points since mid-September, to the current 2.25 percent from 5.25 percent. Financial markets currently look for another one-quarter point rate cut in April. Evans said inflationary pressures are still stronger than most central bankers would like to see.
