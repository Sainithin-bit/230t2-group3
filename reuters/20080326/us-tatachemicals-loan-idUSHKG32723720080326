 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - India's Tata Chemicals ( TTCH.BO ) finalized terms for $850 million in loans to help fund its recent $1 billion acquisition of U.S. soda-ash maker General Chemical Industrial Products, a banker involved in the deal said on Wednesday. 

 The financing will consist of $500 million in a seven-year loan at 1.35 percentage points over LIBOR, with the remaining $350 million coming in the form of a six-month bridge loan, said the banker who declined to be identified ahead of a formal announcement from Tata. The loan will be arranged by ABN AMRO AAH.AS, Bank of Nova Scotia ( BNS.TO ), Calyon, HSBC ( HSBA.L ) ( 0005.HK ), Mizuho Financial Group ( 8411.T ), Rabobank RABN.UL, and Standard Chartered ( STAN.L ) ( 2888.HK ), the source said. "It's all done and funded," said the banker, adding the terms had been agreed to last week. Tata Chemical's managing director Homi Khusrokhan told reporters on Tuesday the inorganic chemicals maker had arranged $850 million in financing, but said it would announce details by this week following regulatory approval for the acquisition. Tata Chemicals agreed in January to pay $1 billion to buy General Chemical to give it access to low-cost natural soda ash reserves and to gain a presence in the North American market.
