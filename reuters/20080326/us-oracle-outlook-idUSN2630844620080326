 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Oracle Corp ORCL.O expects current-quarter revenue from new software to increase 10 percent to 20 percent from a year earlier, Chief Financial Officer Safra Catz said on Wednesday. 

 The business software maker also expects fiscal fourth-quarter earnings per share of 43 cents to 44 cents before some costs, Catz told analysts on a conference call following Oracle's third-quarter earnings report. Net income should be 37 cents to 38 cents per share in the fourth quarter, Catz said. (Reporting by  Philipp Gollner  in San Francisco and  Jim Finkle  in Boston, editing by Phil Berlowitz)
