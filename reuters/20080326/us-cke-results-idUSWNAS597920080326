 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - CKE Restaurants Inc CKR.N, parent of the Carl's Jr and Hardee's hamburger chains, on Wednesday posted sharply lower quarterly profit as sales declined and it booked expenses related to interest rate swap agreements. 

 CKE reported fiscal fourth-quarter net income of $98,000, or nil per share, compared with net income of $10.3 million, or 15 cents per share, in the year-earlier period ended January 31. Results from the most recent quarter included a $9.5 million, or 11 cents per share, expense to "mark-to-market" its interest rate swap agreements. (Reporting by  Lisa Baertlein )
