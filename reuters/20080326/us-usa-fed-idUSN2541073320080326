 WACO, Texas  (Reuters) - Two Federal Reserve officials warned on Wednesday that the central bank needs to be wary of a rise in inflation even as it navigates the United States through an economic slowdown. 

 The Fed's main goal now should be to continue boosting liquidity in financial markets rather than relentlessly lowering benchmark interest rates, Dallas Federal Reserve President Richard Fisher said at a community forum in Waco. Fisher, with two dissenting votes so this year against the Fed's aggressive interest rate cuts, has emerged as a leading anti-inflation voice on the Federal Open Market Committee. Given the lag between monetary policy actions and their impact on the economy, Fisher said the Fed risks higher and more lasting inflation once the economic rubber starts to hit the road again. "If we again begin to grow, at a time when inflation is still at a very high base level, then we could (create) conditions for sustainable inflation over the long term," he said. Fisher's comment echoed one earlier from Charles Evans, president of the Chicago Fed, who spoke about the economy to the New York Association for Business Economics. As growth starts to rebound, most likely in the second half of 2008, the Fed needs to be "mindful" of inflationary pressures, especially as core inflation runs at undesirably high levels, Evans said. "We are hearing numerous anecdotes of firms passing on cost increases to their downstream customers, and some indicators of inflation expectations have risen," he added. The FOMC has slashed its benchmark federal funds rate by 3 percentage points since mid-September, to the current 2.25 percent from 5.25 percent, to battle a financial crisis sparked by the collapse of the subprime mortgage market. Financial markets look for another one-quarter point rate cut in April as the Fed faces a possible recession. ANEMIC GROWTH A monthly Chicago Fed index that measures dozens of economic indicators now suggests "little or no economic growth over the last few months," Evans said. Fisher conceded that the economy was "anemic" and could remain so for a longer period of time than first believed. However, he told reporters he would not use the term "recession," and did not agree with pundits such as Harvard economist Martin Feldstein, who said this month that the United States could be facing its worst slowdown since World War Two. Both policy-makers said current economic woes were being driven by a slowdown in consumer spending as Americans grapple with rising costs for staple items such as food and energy at the same time housing prices are falling and the job market has turned sour. Consumers have been "remarkably" resilient, but given the current weak employment situation will face "challenges" on incomes and household wealth, Evans told reporters. FOCUS ON LIQUIDITY Fisher said the "pipes" of the U.S. financial system are currently clogged with "hair and other unmentionable things" as part of the fall-out of the subprime mortgage crisis that blew up in August 2007. "As long as we have inflationary forces ... then the priority focus should be figuring out new ways to enhance liquidity, (and) reduce the fear that people have as counter-party risk," he said. Still, Evans, who is not a voter on the FOMC this year, said the Fed currently needs to mull its moves on interest rates through the prism of troubled financial markets rather than monetary policy orthodoxy, he said. "Adjusting the federal funds rate may not be enough to address the special circumstances we face in financial markets, particularly with regard to liquidity and the smooth functioning of markets," he said. The work now being done by banks to clean up their balance sheets "will eventually reduce strains on the real economy from financial conditions," Evans said, especially when complemented by the Fed's "innovative" string of moves to bolster liquidity.
