 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Sales of new homes in the United States probably deteriorated again in February, according to a Reuters poll, as the beleaguered housing market continues to search for bottom. 

 Economists predicted Wednesday's report would show sales came in at an annual rate of 0.58 million units, down a shade from 0.588 million in January. January marked the lowest rate of sales in nearly 13 years and was down 2.8 percent the previous month. The 49 estimates for February sales ranged from 0.56 million to 0.60 million. The report is due at 10 a.m. on Wednesday. The following is a selection of economists' comments: ACTION ECONOMICS Forecast: 0.58 mln "The overall sales outlook remains bleak as the fall-out from credit market turmoil is expected to further weigh on activity through mid-year." MERRILL LYNCH Forecast 0.574 mln "New-home sales are expected to slip more than 2 percent month-on-month to an annual rate of just 574,000 units -- the weakest pace since February 1995." UBS Forecast: 0.575 mln "New-home sales probably fell again in February, albeit at a less rapid pace than in recent months. As usual, however, the volatility in the report raises the potential for surprise." (Polling by Bangalore Polling Unit) (Reporting by  Burton Frierson ; Editing by Leslie Adler)
