 WACO, Texas  (Reuters) - Dallas Federal Reserve President Richard Fisher said on Wednesday that foreign investment was a good thing for the U.S. economy and an important vote of confidence in its future health. 

 "Personally, as long as they adhere to the laws of my country, and to the regulations of my country and the authorities of my country, I am indifferent as to where money comes from, as long as it does not come from truly evil sources" he told a community forum hosted by the Dallas Fed. Foreign sovereign wealth funds have recently bought major stakes in several big U.S. banks to repair the damage done by the subprime mortgage crisis. Fisher, in response to a question after remarks over lunch, said the money was welcome. "I am grateful that people want to invest in America. It is a vote of confidence. If they didn't want to invest here, I would be really worried," he said. (Reporting by  Ros Krasny  and  Alister Bull ; Editing by Leslie Adler)
