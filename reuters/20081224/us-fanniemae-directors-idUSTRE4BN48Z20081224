 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Fannie Mae, the largest provider of money for U.S. residential mortgages, on Wednesday said its regulator named nine board members, including a former Morgan Stanley executive. 

 The appointment of David Sidwell, who was Morgan Stanley's chief financial officer from March 2004 to October 2007, and eight others comes after the government in September forced the company and rival Freddie Mac into conservatorships under their regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Fannie Mae FNM.P and Freddie Mac FRE.P have lost billions of dollars as the housing slump boosted delinquencies, raising alarm among regulators and lawmakers who are counting on the companies to help stabilize the market for U.S. home mortgages. The other directors are Fannie Mae Chief Executive Officer Herb Allison; Dennis Beresford, former chairman of the Financial Accounting Standards Board; William Thomas Forrester, former CFO of the Progressive Corp.; Brenda J. Gaines, former CEO of Diners Club North America, a subsidiary of Citigroup Inc.; Charlynn Goins, former chairman of New York City Health and Hospitals Corp.; Frederick "Bart" Harvey III, former chairman of the board of trustees of Enterprise Community Partners; Egbert Perry, chairman and CEO of the Integral Group LLC; and Diana Taylor, a former managing director for Wolfensohn & Company. Beresford and Gaines have served as Fannie Mae directors since 2006. Harvey has been a director since August 2008. (Reporting by  Al Yoon ; Editing by Leslie Adler)
