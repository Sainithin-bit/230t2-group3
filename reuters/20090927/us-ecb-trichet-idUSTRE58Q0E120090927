 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said U.S. commitment to a strong dollar is important in keeping currency markets and the global economy stable. 

 Trichet also told Italy's Corriere della Serra newspaper that he welcomed a reference in the Group of 20 summit communique that a sense of normalcy should not lead to complacency. "I consider very important for the stability of the exchange rates and the prosperity of the global economy that (U.S. Federal Reserve) Chairman Ben Bernanke, Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner and President (Barack) Obama underline 'that a strong dollar is in the interest of the US'," he said, according to an interview transcript published on the ECB's Web site on Sunday. "I trust that it is not only true but that it is also very important for the global economic stability." (Reporting by  Krista Hughes )
