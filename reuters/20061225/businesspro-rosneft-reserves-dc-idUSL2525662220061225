 MOSCOW  (Reuters) - Russian state oil company Rosneft 
( ROSN.MM ) said on Monday it had added 862 million barrels of 
new oil reserves in 2006, or 46 percent more than its forecast 
production. 

  Rosneft, which turned into a state champion from a 
mid-sized oil player in 2004 following a forced state auction 
of the key oil unit of bankrupt company YUKOS, already has 
proven reserves of 18.9 billion barrels of oil equivalent.  Its reserves include 14.9 billion barrels of liquids, 
making Rosneft the world's 11th-largest company on the list of 
oil reserves holders, on a par with Mexico's Pemex.  The firm enjoys strong state support and has won a number 
of licences for lucrative deposits in the past years.  The company said new reserves in 2006 were confirmed at its 
Vankor field in East Siberia and deposits developed by the 
former YUKOS unit, Yuganskneftegaz.  Rosneft expects its oil output to reach 80.6 million tonnes 
(1.6 million barrels per day) this year, or 8.2 percent more 
than in 2005. The company plans to raise production by a 
further 11.7 percent to 90 million tonnes (1.8 million bpd) 
next year.
