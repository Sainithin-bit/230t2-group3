 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President-elect Barack Obama is expected to tap New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson as U.S. secretary of commerce, NBC News said on Friday. 

 Richardson, a former United Nations ambassador and energy secretary during President Bill Clinton's administration, had been an early supporter of Obama after dropping his own presidential ambitions.
