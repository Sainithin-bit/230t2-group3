 GENEVA  (Reuters) - Countries negotiating a new global trade pact showed no willingness to budge from their fixed positions in past days, the chairman of agriculture talks at the World Trade Organization (WTO) said on Friday. 

 "Zip, nada, nyet, nul ... They ain't changed their positions," mediator Crawford Falconer told journalists after holding talks that were meant to clear the way for ministers to come to Geneva to seek a breakthrough in the WTO's Doha round. Last weekend, a G20 summit on the global financial crisis called for an outline Doha deal to be reached by the end of the year to ward off protectionism and boost business confidence.
