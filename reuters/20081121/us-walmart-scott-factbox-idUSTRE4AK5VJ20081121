 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc, the world's largest retailer, said Lee Scott will retire as chief executive early next year and will be succeeded by Mike Duke, who heads its international operations. 

 Here is some key information about Lee Scott's tenure. * Scott told the company on November 15 that he would retire as president and CEO as of the close of business on January 31, 2009. Scott will stay on as chairman and be employed through January 31, 2011. * Scott, 59, joined Wal-Mart in 1979 as an assistant director in the logistics division. After serving in various roles he became president and CEO in 2000. * Shares of Wal-Mart traded between $64 and $65.94 on January 14, 2000, the day Wal-Mart said then-CEO and President David Glass would immediately step down and be succeeded by Scott. The shares were trading between $50.50 and $52.45 on Friday when the company announced Scott would step down from the CEO post. * Much of Scott's tenure as CEO was marked by struggles against trendier stores such as Target Corp. Wal-Mart has also faced attacks from union-backed groups that accused it of mistreating employees, offering poor pay and health benefits and driving competitors out of business. * An attempt to sell trendy clothing and higher-end merchandise in recent years failed to draw wealthier shoppers. Wal-Mart's profit took a hit last year when it cut prices to clear out poor-selling merchandise. * A renewed emphasis on low prices has paid off as cost-conscious consumers now flock to its stores for items such as groceries and medicine. Wal-Mart reported a slightly better-than-expected 10 percent rise in third-quarter profit earlier this month, while Target's third-quarter profit fell nearly 24 percent. * During Scott's tenure Wal-Mart began selling generic drugs at low costs, a move that spread to other retailers. Wal-Mart also asked suppliers to meet stricter environmental standards, including reducing the amount of packaging and improving energy efficiency of products sold at its stores. * Beginning February 1, 2009, Scott's annual salary will be $1.1 million. In fiscal 2008, Scott's annual base salary was $1.4 million. Scott will be eligible for an incentive payment for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2009 but will not be entitled to an incentive payment for fiscal 2010 or after that. * Wal-Mart said it would accelerate certain restricted stock grants that are scheduled to vest at age 65 to vest on February 1, 2011 as long as Scott meets certain requirements including extending a non-compete agreement through March 14, 2016. * Scott's unvested stock options, restricted stock and performance shares will continue to vest through January 31, 2011, with several exceptions. Scott will forfeit 25 percent of the 208,508 target performance shares he received on January 22, 2007, 25 percent of the 55,608 target performance shares he received on March 26, 2007, and 50 percent of the 299,496 target performance shares he received on January 21, 2008.
