 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc is looking at multiple options as its share price sinks, including selling businesses, selling shares, or merging with another firm, a person familiar with the matter said. 

 So far discussions regarding its options have been internal, the person said. Citigroup's shares lost more than a quarter of their value on Thursday and half their value this week amid concerns about the bank's capital position. (Reporting by  Dan Wilchins ; Editing by  Gary Hill )
