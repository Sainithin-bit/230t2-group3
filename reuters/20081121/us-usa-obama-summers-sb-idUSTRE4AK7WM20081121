 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President-elect Barack Obama is likely to name former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers as an economic adviser with the expectation that he will eventually be tapped for the Federal Reserve Board, The New York Times reported on Friday. 

 Citing two sources familiar with the Obama transition, the newspaper also said that Summers could perhaps succeed Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, whose term expires in January 2010. (Editing by Leslie Adler)
