 (Reuters) - Ladenburg Thalmann's Dick Bove said he does not see any reason for Citigroup to fail, and maintained his "buy" rating on the stock. 

 The current decline in the stock price is reflecting a series of fears related to loans and security values that cannot be actualized without a severe setback in the economy and a very rapid increase in interest rates, Bove said. "I would be a buyer of this stock," Bove wrote in a note to clients. Citigroup shares lost more than one-quarter of its market value on Thursday as investors questioned the banks ability to handle potential credit losses and write-downs in 2009. The bank has been reeling on concerns that mounting losses from credit cards, mortgages and toxic debt could overwhelm its efforts to slash costs and add deposits. Citigroup has access to U.S. Federal Reserve funds, is working at insuring some of its debt and is reducing its balance sheet faster than any other company in the banking industry, said analyst Bove who believes these steps backstops the bank's liabilities. "It would take a Depression every bit as large and long as the 1930s debacle to shake this company's viability," Bove said. Citigroup shares were trading up 4 percent at $4.94 in after the bell trading. (Reporting by Sweta Singh in Bangalore, Editing by Dinesh Nair)
