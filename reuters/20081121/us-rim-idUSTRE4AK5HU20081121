 TORONTO  (Reuters) - Research In Motion's RIM.TO RIMM.O high-end BlackBerry Bold smartphone is selling "really well," the company's co-CEO said on Thursday, even as an analyst warned RIM would not be immune from the slowing economy. 

 Speaking at an investor conference, Jim Balsillie also reiterated it's unlikely that customers will get rid of their mobile phones to save money during the downturn. (Reporting by Wojtek Dabrowski; editing by Rob Wilson)
