 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - While Citigroup's shares have lost over half 

 their value this week, Citi's credit default swaps are not yet trading at levels that indicate extreme distress, if history is any guide. Citigroup's shares stood at $3.95 midday on Friday, while its credit default swaps traded at 500 basis points, or $500,000 a year for five years for every $10 million of principal protected. The following is a list of where banks' shares and credit default levels stood in the day or hours before regulators shut them down or pushed them to sell themselves this year.
