 (Reuters) - Signs of interest in Tyco International from Schneider Electric have prompted investors to look at the possibility of bids from European conglomerates ABB and Siemens. 

 Here are some facts about Tyco's three main lines of business, its geographic presence, and how it would complement the operations of Europe's main industrial goods companies. SECURITY SOLUTIONS Tyco's security solutions unit provides electronic products and services, from burglar alarm to remote video monitoring, to residential and commercial customers, as well as governments. Tyco holds 11 percent of the $68 billion-plus global electronic security industry market, according to a February 23 presentation posted on the company's website. Its main competitors include Secom, United Technologies (UTC) and Honeywell. Security solutions contributed 49 percent of Tyco's $706 million first-quarter income, and with an operating margin of 16.5 percent, were Tyco's most profitable division. Schneider, which specializes in energy management, sees security as part of an integrated system for large buildings and industrial sites that can save up to 30 percent on their energy bill, according to the company's latest annual report. According to Schneider, its buildings business is No. 4 worldwide in building automation and video security systems, bolstered by its acquisition of Pelco, a developer and manufacturer of video security systems, in 2007. Schneider's buildings business contributed only 4.6 percent to its 2010 earnings before interest, tax and amortization (EBITA) of 2.9 billion euros. With an EBITA margin of 9.6 percent, it was the least profitable of its five business units. Siemens has a building technologies division that also provides security solutions. This division accounted for 13.1 percent of the 3.5 billion euro profit posted by the German's company's industry arm in 2010. ABB also offers security solutions as part of its building automation offering. However, this sits within the Swiss company's low-voltage products division, which is geared toward industrial machines and plants. In 2010, low-voltage products contributed 21.1 percent of ABB's $3.8 billion earnings before interest and tax (EBIT). FIRE PROTECTION Tyco's fire protection division offers prevention and protection products and services, from alarm and sprinkler systems to portable extinguishers. Tyco holds 11 percent of the $32 billion-plus global fire industry market, according to a February 23 presentation posted on the company's website. Its main competitors include Siemens, UTC and Honeywell. Fire protection contributed 12.5 percent of Tyco's $706 million first-quarter income, and with operating margins of 8 percent, was Tyco's least profitable division after its electrical and metal products unit. Fire protection would fit within Schneider's building control portfolio, though the synergies would mostly lie with the electrical components offerings of the two companies. Siemens would almost double its share in the fire industry market by acquiring Tyco. ABB, which is not a significant player, would have to integrate fire protection, most likely in its low-voltage products division. FLOW CONTROL Tyco's flow control unit provides industrial valves and control systems for industries such as oil and gas, power, water, mining, process and construction. Tyco holds 7 percent of the $29 billion-plus global industrial valves and controls market, according to a February 23 presentation posted on the company's website. Its main competitors include Emerson Electric, Cameron and Flowserve. Flow control contributed 14 percent of Tyco's $706 million first-quarter income. Analysts suggest little synergies exist between the unit and Schneider. Were Schneider to buy Tyco, it could be tempted by Swedish lockmaker Assa Abloy's $930 million sale of Cardo Flow Solutions to try to sell Tyco's flow control. ABB and Schneider could integrate the unit within their industrial process offering or also choose to sell it, analysts say. GEOGRAPHIC MIX Tyco generated 49 percent of its $17 billion revenue in 2010 in the U.S., 10 percent in the rest of the Americas, 23 percent in Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and 18 percent in Asia-Pacific. Schneider made 34 percent of its 19.6 billion euros sales in 2010 in Western Europe, 24 percent in Asia-Pacific, 24 percent in North America and 18 percent in the rest of the world. Siemens generated 54.5 percent of its 75.6 billion euro revenue in 2010 in EMEA, 27.2 percent in the Americas -- mostly in the US -- and 18.3 percent in Australasia. ABB generated 39.2 percent of its $31.6 billion revenue in 2010 in Europe, 19.6 percent in the Americas, 28.1 percent in Asia and 13.1 percent in Middle East and Africa.
