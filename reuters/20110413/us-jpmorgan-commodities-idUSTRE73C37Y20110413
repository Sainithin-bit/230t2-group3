 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co made few changes to its commodities trading risk in the first quarter as energy, metals and agricultural markets extended a broad rally from the two previous quarters. 

 JPMorgan's value-at-Risk (VaR) for commodities stood at $13 million in the first quarter, compared with $14 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and $15 million a year ago, the No. 2 U.S. bank said in its earnings report on Wednesday. VaR is an industry measure for how much of a bank's money is at risk on a given day for trading a particular asset class. Commodities posted out-sized gains over the last three quarters, mainly due to supply shocks and strong demand from investors looking for a hedge against a deteriorating dollar. The 19-commodity Reuters-Jefferies CRB index, a key industry benchmark, rose a cumulative 40 percent in the period. (Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)
