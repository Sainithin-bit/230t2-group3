 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Risks to Japan's economy are firmly to the downside with very high uncertainty about the nuclear crisis and power shortages, a senior IMF official said, suggesting further cuts to the country's growth forecast. 

 Recent yen declines may hurt the economy by pushing up import costs, but only for a few months until output starts to recover from last month's devastating earthquake, said Naoyuki Shinohara, deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund. "There's very high uncertainty on Japan's outlook. The forecast we issued is one for the time being, based on the assumption that power shortages and supply chain disruptions will be resolved two to three months from now," Shinohara said. "If power shortages are prolonged or if the situation at the nuclear plant deteriorates, the outlook will change. The current forecast is our main scenario, but the risk is firmly to the downside," he told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday. The IMF on Monday cut Japan's growth forecast to 1.4 percent this year from 1.6 percent projected three months ago. But many private-sector analysts expect the damage to be bigger, with some warning Japan may barely escape a contraction this year. The Bank of Japan is expected to cut its growth forecast for the current fiscal year when it issues a twice-yearly outlook on April 28. It forecast in January that it expected Japan's economy to grow 1.6 percent in the year from April. FISCAL PLAN NEEDED Shinohara, who was Japan's currency tsar before assuming the IMF post, said last month's joint Group of Seven currency intervention in the wake of the quake was an appropriate step to counter sharp yen rises, which were driven by speculative moves. The yen has fallen sharply since then as markets shift their attention to the diverging monetary policy direction of advanced economies, with the BOJ seen sticking to its ultra-loose policy even as other central banks pull back on economic stimulus. Shinohara said it was hard to predict whether yen weakness will continue but said: "What's best is for exchange-rate moves to be stable." He also said he saw no need to worry about the risk of a triple "Japan selling" of the yen, stocks and bonds despite lingering worries about the damage from last month's disaster. Japanese policymakers are battling to contain damage from the 9.0 magnitude earthquake and tsunami that battered its northeast coast last month, crippling a nuclear power plant and disrupting factory output with supply disruptions and power shortages. The BOJ loosened monetary policy days after the quake, and the government is set to compile emergency budgets to support rebuilding efforts, which analysts say may eventually amount to 10 trillion yen ($120 billion) or more in spending. Shinohara said Japan should be able to issue enough bonds to meet reconstruction costs without disrupting markets, although a temporary tax hike could be an option once the economy picks up. "What's most important is for Japan to offer a medium- and long-term roadmap on fiscal reform once there is more clarity on the total cost for reconstruction," he said. The BOJ has responded quickly to the quake and is expected to continue acting flexibly to support the economy, such as expanding asset purchases if necessary, Shinohara said. The central bank cut its economic assessment this month and has expressed its readiness to ease policy further if the quake's damage threatens Japan's return to a moderate economic recovery.
