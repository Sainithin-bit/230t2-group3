 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. bonds and the dollar rose on Wednesday on hopes that President Barack Obama's $4 trillion deficit reduction plan would shore up the United States' credit-worthiness and the dollar's reserve status. 

 Oil jumped 1.5 percent, recovering from two days of losses, after data showed the biggest weekly decline in gasoline inventory since October 1998. Obama set a time-frame of 12 years or less to reach the goal of $4 trillion in U.S. deficit reduction as he warned that steadily rising debt could cost jobs, harm the economy and force Washington to borrow more from other countries such as China. "It's a positive from a credit and currency perspective. It's positive in the sense that the U.S. can (better) meet its obligations," said James Caron, global head of rates research at Morgan Stanley in New York. The yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year government debt fell to the lowest level in a week, while the dollar posted gains versus the yen and euro. As government leaders wrestle over how to tackle United States' long-term fiscal predicament, investors were reticent to commit to stocks and other risky assets on uncertainties over the durability of global economic and profit growth. Wall Street ended flat to slightly higher after struggling much of the session on doubts over corporate profits. An initial rise in U.S. stocks fizzled, despite strong profit growth from JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ), the No. 2 U.S. bank. Analysts questioned whether the results from JPMorgan, the first major Wall Street bank to report this quarter, were a one-time win or a harbinger of others' performance.

"People are getting the sense that no matter what these companies say, the easy money has already been made so it will be tough to see further upward movement," said Rick Fier, vice president at Conifer Securities in New York, which has about $7 billion in assets under administration. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  closed up 0.06 percent at 12,270.99, while the Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was up 0.02 percent at 1,314.41. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  rose 0.61 percent to 2,761.52. World stocks as measured by MSCI .MIWD00000PUS were up 0.3 percent. Earlier, the FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3 , the index of Europe's top shares, closed up 0.7 percent, a day after posting its biggest one-day fall in a month. Bank shares rose, boosted by the JPMorgan results. Japan's Nikkei index  .N225  rose 0.9 percent on the day on thin volume. COMMODITIES STAGE LATE BOUNCE Like stocks, commodities had a roller-coaster session. The price of Brent crude oil ended up more than $1.50 at $122.61 a barrel after a two-day sell-off caused by worries that high prices would crimp demand. U.S. oil prices closed up 0.7 percent at $106.96, erasing mid-afternoon losses. Gold closed up about $3 at $1,456.74 an ounce after earlier rising as high $1,462 on a weaker dollar. The dollar rebounded against the yen after the Japanese government lowered its economic outlook to reflect last month's devastating earthquake and tsunami, its first downgrade in six months. The dollar was up 0.3 percent at 83.83 yen, a day after the greenback recorded its biggest one-day percentage drop in four months. The euro was down 0.3 percent at $1.4437, after earlier hitting a 15-month peak of $1.4521 on the EBS trading platform. Overall sentiment toward the greenback, however, remains largely bearish given expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve will significantly lag global central banks in raising interest rates. In bond trading, U.S. government debt prices rose, erasing earlier losses, despite weaker-than-expected results at a $21 billion auction of 10-year notes.
