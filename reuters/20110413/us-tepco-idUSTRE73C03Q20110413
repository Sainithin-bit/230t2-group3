 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan may cap Tokyo Electric Power's ( 9501.T ) liability to as little as $24 billion for damages stemming from its crippled nuclear plant, the Yomiuri newspaper reported, citing a draft plan being considered by the plant operator and the government. 

 Shares of Tokyo Electric jumped 12 percent while Kansai Electric ( 9503.T ) and other utilities fell as the newspaper said they may be asked to shoulder some of the compensation costs under the draft scheme. The scheme is designed to ease worries in the financial market over the fate of Tokyo Electric, which is the country's largest corporate bond issuer and whose shares are widely held by financial institutions, the newspaper said. Under the plan, Tokyo Electric's liability would be capped at 2 to 3.8 trillion yen ($24-45 billion) and the company, Asia's largest utility, would pay 100 to 200 billion yen annually for 15 years from its profits, the newspaper said. Tokyo Electric was not immediately available for comment. The plan calls for other power firms to contribute to a fund that would shoulder up to 2.7 trillion yen of compensation payouts, with the remaining damages to be handled by the government, the Yomiuri said. The utilities, including Tokyo Electric, would contribute to the fund in proportion to the number of reactors they own. This could come to about 30 to 50 billion yen for each reactor, the newspaper said. The draft plan will likely face hurdles including opposition from shareholders of other utilities such as Kansai Electric ( 9503.T ), which has 11 reactors and could be asked to contribute as much as 550 billion yen under the scheme, the paper said. Shares of Kansai Electric, which provides power to Osaka and its neighboring areas, fell 3.8 percent to 1,785 yen while Chubu Electric ( 9502.T ), which serves Nagoya and its surrounding areas, declined 2.6 percent to 1,870 yen. On March 11 a magnitude 9 earthquake and a massive tsunami tore through Tokyo Electric's Fukushima Daiichi facility, 240 km (150 miles) north of Tokyo, causing radiation leaks in the world's worst nuclear disaster in 25 years.
