 SEOUL  (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co Ltd ( 005930.KS ), the world's top memory chip maker, said on Friday it expected industry oversupply in NAND flash memory chips to continue throughout the second half. 

 Hong Wan-hoon, vice president of Samsung's semiconductor business, also said there was a possibility that the global economic slowdown would reduce electronics demand and hurt the memory chip market. (Reporting by Rhee So-eui; editing by Keiron Henderson)
