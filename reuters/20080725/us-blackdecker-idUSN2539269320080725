 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Black & Decker Corp BDK.N reported on Friday that quarterly profit fell less than expected as a favorable tax rate helped offset effects of the severe U.S. housing slump, which has sliced demand for its power tools, locks and plumbing products. 

 The U.S. manufacturer cut its full-year profit forecast, warning it is starting to see a slowdown in demand from Western Europe and noting that materials costs are rising faster than expected. Net income in the second quarter fell 18.1 percent to $96.7 million, or $1.58 a diluted share, from $118 million, or $1.75 per share, a year earlier. The Towson, Maryland-based company noted the latest profit included 12 cents a share resulted from a lower tax rate. Analysts, on average, expected profit of $1.41 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales were down 3.4 percent to $1.64 billion. "Weak demand in the U.S. and slowing conditions in parts of Western Europe ... resulted in lower sales and earnings," said Nolan Archibald, chairman and chief executive, in a statement. It now looks for full-year profit of $5.25 to $5.45 per share versus its April forecast of $5.25 to $5.65. Analysts, on average, expect $5.34 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Black & Decker shares are down about 14 percent so far this year, in line with the slide in the Dow Jones U.S. durable household products index .DJUSHD.
