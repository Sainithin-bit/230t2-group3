 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Chrysler LLC's financial arm is planning to stop offering vehicle lease options to consumers and would focus on financing retail vehicle purchases, spokesman Bill Porter said on Friday. 

 "We are shifting our strategy to focus on retail products," he said. "Effective August 1 we will no longer offer lease products in the United States." (Reporting by  Poornima Gupta ; editing by Phil Berlowitz)
