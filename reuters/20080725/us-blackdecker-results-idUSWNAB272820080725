 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Tool maker Black & Decker Corp BDK.N said on Friday its quarterly profit fell, hurt by weak demand in the United States and slowing conditions in parts of Western Europe. 

 Net income in the second quarter fell to $96.7 million, or $1.58 a share, compared with $118 million, or $1.75 per share, a year earlier. (Reporting by  Euan Rocha ; Editing by  Derek Caney )
