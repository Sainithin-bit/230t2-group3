 BANGALORE  (Reuters) - Vonage Holdings Corp ( VG.N ) will name a new chief executive as early as next week, The Wall Street Journal said, citing people familiar with the matter. 

 The Web-based phone company said on Thursday it has a letter of commitment from Silver Point Finance LLC to provide up to $215 million in private debt financing, after months of negotiations. Jeffrey Citron, Vonage's chairman and interim chief executive, plans to let someone else manage day-to-day operations, though he will remain involved with the company, the paper said. Vonage was a pioneer in selling Web-based phone services to consumers looking for a cheaper alternative to traditional landline services. But it has been bleeding red ink since its start, and has faced growing competition from Skype, a unit of online auction company eBay Inc ( EBAY.O ), and cable service providers' voice services. Vonage could not be immediately reached for comment. (Reporting by  Ajay Kamalakaran ; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)
