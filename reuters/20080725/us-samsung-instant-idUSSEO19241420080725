 SEOUL  (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co Ltd ( 005930.KS ), the world's top maker of memory chips, posted a 51 percent rise in second-quarter profit as strong earnings in flat screens and handsets made up for sluggish chip results. 

 The South Korean company, also the world's top maker of liquid crystal display (LCD) screens, reported April-June net profit of 2.14 trillion won ($2.12 billion) versus 1.42 trillion won a year ago during a market slump for dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips used mainly in personal computers. The result missed a forecast for 2.30 trillion won from 10 analysts polled by Reuters. Following are some reactions from fund managers and analysts: CHUNG MYONG-HOON, ANALYST, HANWHA SECURITIES "Shares in Samsung are following the movements of the global economy. If constantly high oil prices and credit jitters are factored into the global economy in the second half of the year, demand for technology products will fall. "Samsung, as a leading technology company, is going to see weaker business in its flagship handset and LCD divisions from the second half of the year." - - - - AN SEUNG-HO, ANALYST, KB INVESTMENTS & SECURITIES "Macroeconomic issues, such as weak global demand, are the main risks that all major companies face, not just Samsung Electronics. "In terms of DRAM and NAND, the main question is how fast the demand will recover. As companies cut down on developing new facilities, supplies will decrease in the future, which leaves room for a recovery. "LCD screens on the other hand are a completely different story. Supply will grow for LCDs, so unless there is a dramatic increase in demand, it is safe to say that the LCD market is on a downward spiral." - - - - JAY KIM, ANALYST, HYUNDAI SECURITIES "Earnings came out weaker than expected, and it appears that the second half operating environment will be challenging for Samsung Elec. Recovery in the memory chip sector will not come anytime soon as the macro backdrop remains weak, though it will not get worse from here. The handset unit will probably continue to perform solidly, though I'd say a peak is near."
