 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wachovia Corp WB.N shares fell as much as 10 percent on Friday after a downgrade by a Morgan Keegan & Co analyst, who said the stock's 73 percent rise in seven trading days wasn't justified in light of its credit problems. 

 Analyst Robert Patten cut his rating for Wachovia to "underperform" from "market perform." The downgrade came a day after Wachovia, the fourth-largest U.S. bank, said Chief Financial Officer Thomas Wurtz was resigning and three days after it reported a record second-quarter loss of $8.86 billion. Patten recommended investors buy shares of SunTrust Banks Inc ( STI.N ) and First Horizon National Corp ( FHN.N ). The Southeast regional banks are better positioned in terms of capital and reserves to handle the nation's credit crisis, and have more predictable earnings streams into 2009, he said. The 73 percent increase in Wachovia's share price came from July 15 to July 24, when the 24-member KBW Bank Index .BKX of large U.S. banks rose 32 percent. The gains came as several big U.S. lenders reported quarterly results that were better than feared, or not as bad as feared. Wachovia shares were boosted after Chief Executive Robert Steel said Tuesday the Charlotte, North Carolina bank didn't need to issue common stock or sell assets at fire-sale prices to bolster capital. But the bank increased its forecast for losses in its $122 billion portfolio of option adjustable-rate mortgages to 12 percent from an earlier 7 percent to 8 percent. "Investors have become overly optimistic too soon," Patten wrote. "There are no easy fixes here, and in our opinion restructuring this balance sheet will take time, in what is a difficult and volatile market and would probably not come without more pain for existing shareholders." In early afternoon trading, Wachovia shares were down $1.25, or 8 percent, at $14.44 on the New York Stock Exchange after earlier falling to $14.14. They began the year at $38.03, and bottomed at $7.81 during the day on July 15. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel; editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)
