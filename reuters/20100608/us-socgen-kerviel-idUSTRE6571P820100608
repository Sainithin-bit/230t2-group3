 PARIS  (Reuters) - Jerome Kerviel said his bosses at Societe Generale encouraged him to take risky market positions as judges on the first day of his trial examined his role in a 4.9 billion euro trading loss that threatened to bring down the French bank. 

 The 33-year-old ex-trader, dressed in an elegant, dark suit, began his defense through his lawyer, saying his superiors tolerated breaches in the bank's risk control systems. "The encouragement of my superiors did not slow me down," Kerviel said, speaking in a barely audible voice, answering questions from the presiding judge. "At certain times it was extreme ... Tiring, physically," Kerviel told the hot, cramped courtroom in Paris's Palais de Justice. He said that he worked from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m., bank holidays included, with only a brief break to eat a sandwich at his desk. Kerviel's lawyer presented the man as a pawn in a wider game while Societe Generale's lawyer called for punishment for his actions. The trial comes as Societe Generale struggles to restore investor confidence amid a fragile economic recovery and looming regulation. Kerviel quickly rose through the ranks of "middle-office" and assistant roles before becoming a trader for the bank. He has admitted to building unauthorized trading positions that rocked world markets when Societe Generale revealed the 4.9 billion-euro ($6.6 billion) loss in January 2008. During the largely procedural first day of the trial, Kerviel's lawyer said Societe Generale would have been clearly able to see data showing Kerviel's extraordinary profits of 1.4 billion euros at the end of 2007. Lawyers also read a transcript of a conversation between Kerviel and SocGen's ex-investment bank chief Jean-Pierre Mustier when the scandal broke, in which Mustier reportedly said: "If you won 1.4 billion euros, that means you're very good. What you did was a pain, but it's not a big deal." "PAWN FOR PROFIT" Kerviel, who could face five years in jail and a 375,000-euro fine if found guilty of charges of breach of trust, computer abuse and forgery, said he works as a consultant and makes 2,300 euros a month. Seated on a plastic chair in front of rows of lawyers in black garb, the ex-trader said his annual salary at Societe Generale was 48,000 euros in 2006 with an annual bonus of 60,000 euros. The trial has drawn hundreds of journalists from around the globe. The presiding judge has banned the use of microblogging service Twitter inside the courtroom. Kerviel is one of the most famous symbols of the financial crisis and his trial is seen as important for matters of future regulation and crisis prevention. "The trial will be watched closely around the world because it's a symbol of financial excess and what's going to be done about it," Bradley Simon, senior partner of law firm Simon & Partners LLP, which specializes in white-collar defense, said in a phone interview. The trial also tests the ability of Societe Generale to cast the blame on Kerviel or whether his actions will be seen as "a cultural flaw in our capitalistic system," Simon added. Upon his arrival at court, Kerviel remained silent and allowed his lawyer, Olivier Metzner, to address the media. "We hope that there will be transparency, that the truth will not be obstructed by Societe Generale, like it has been for two years," Metzner said. Kerviel was used as a pawn for profit and then thrown away, he said. CHAIRMAN ABSENT The bank's former chairman, Daniel Bouton, who was forced to step down last year in part due to the handling of the Kerviel scandal, has refused to appear in person at the trial, seeing his written testimony as sufficient, the presiding judge said. Although Kerviel has admitted to building unauthorized trading positions leading up to the loss in 2008, he has said breaches in Societe Generale's risk control system were tolerated, and this has been a key part of his legal defense. Societe Generale has hit back by saying he acted alone and that investigating magistrates had dismissed his claims of tacit complicity from his bosses. The bank said before the trial that it held Kerviel entirely responsible and called for "exemplary punishment." Facing off in the trial are two of Paris' best-known lawyers -- Metzner and Jean Veil. Cigar-smoking barrister Metzner's clients include ex-Panama dictator Manuel Noriega, former Vivendi boss Jean-Marie Messier and former French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin. The trial is due to run until June 25, clashing with Societe Generale's investor day on June 15. Analysts have said the bank's brand has suffered in the wake of the Kerviel scandal, allowing rival BNP Paribas to gain the advantage with domestic retail customers and, at the same time, forcing SocGen to cut down on proprietary trading.
