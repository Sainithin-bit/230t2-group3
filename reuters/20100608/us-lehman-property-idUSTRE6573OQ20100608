 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bankrupt Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEHMQ.PK has asked for permission to make a new $255 million debt investment in a New York building, saying the stake would protect Lehman's earlier investments, which could be wiped out if another party acquired the debt. 

 The investment bank already has a $437 million stake in the building, which is located on a valuable stretch of Park Avenue, according to court documents released on Monday. Lehman, which collapsed in September 2008, has filed a motion in New York bankruptcy court to purchase the B Note of a senior debt facility, using estate funds. "Making a new investment in 237 Park by purchasing the B Note from the seller has significant upside for Lehman Brothers Holdings and represents the best means of protecting LBHI's current investment ... which could potentially be wiped out if a party other than LBHI acquires the B Note and pursues a foreclosure of the B Note," the company wrote in its motion to U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James Peck at the New York bankruptcy court. Lehman had originated some $1.23 billion in loans to finance the purchase of the 21-storey building in May 2007. "LBHI in consultation with the official committee of unsecured creditors will seek to purchase the B Note at the most favorable terms possible," said Lehman. "However acquisition of the B Note even at its par value represents a valuable investment for LBHI and its estate." The documents did not give more details about the possible value. A call to Lehman's attorney at Weil Gotshal was directed to another Lehman representative, who was not immediately available to comment. Broadway Partners owns the building, which occupies the entire block-front on Park Ave between 45th and 46th streets. (Reporting by  Chelsea Emery , editing by Matthew Lewis)
