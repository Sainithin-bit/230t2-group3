 MEXICO CITY  (Reuters) - Mexican broadcaster Televisa will be allowed to buy a stake in cable company TVI only if it agrees to offer its popular free channels to competitors, Mexico's anti-trust agency said on Sunday. 


 The cable company formed by the Televisa ( TV.N )( TLVACPO.MX ) TVI merger would also have to broadcast the free channels of competitors such as TV Azteca. TVAZTCACPO.MX. "Only if it meets these conditions can the transaction go ahead," the Federal Competition Commission, CFC, said in a statement. Televisa said the ruling was excessive. "The conditions imposed by the CFC seem very tough and out of proportion to the purchase of a minority stake in a Monterrey cable company," a source in the company said. Last year, the Mexican press reported that Televisa made a $69 million offer for a 50 percent stake in Monterrey-based Television Internacional (TVI). Televisa, which did not confirm how large the stake is that it wants to buy, said it would carefully study the resolution before deciding on a course of action. Televisa dominates Mexican broadcasting, producing hugely popular "telenovela" soap operas and news programs for its non-cable network. Competitors worry Televisa will keep them out of the cable market by blocking access to these programs. Televisa wants to stretch its reach in the industry as Mexico embraces "triple play," which will allow phone companies to enter the television market, and cable and other media companies to sell phone services. The broadcaster is also trying to buy a $258 million, 49 percent stake in one of Mexico's largest cable operators, Cablemas. The CFC said it was analyzing that deal using the same criteria as it did in the TVI case. Televisa already operates a cable service, Cablevision, which only covers Mexico City. Its SKY direct-to-home satellite television business has a nationwide footprint. They both account for 22 percent of Televisa's total revenue. Cablevision has 500,000 subscribers while SKY ended 2006 with 1.43 million clients. Mexico gave final approval for a triple-play plan late in 2006. The new standard allows for the delivery of high-speed Internet, television and phone services over a single connection and is expected to lower prices for customers.
