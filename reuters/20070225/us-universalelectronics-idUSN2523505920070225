 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Universal Electronics Inc. ( UEIC.O ), a wireless technology developer that makes remote controls for consumer electronics companies, sits on top of a "fast-growing niche," Barron's reported in its February 26 edition. 


 Revenue for the Cypress, California-based company has more than doubled to $236 million last year from $104 million in 2002, while earnings increased at an even quicker rate, excluding stock options and other items, Barron's said. Barron's said the advent of the "electronic home" has put Universal's products in more demand. Among its clients are Sony 6746.T, Motorola MOT.N, Comcast ( CMCSA.O ) and DirectTV.
