 MUMBAI  (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group ( GS.N ), the world's largest investment bank, plans to start doing mutual fund business in India, the Business Standard news paper reported on Sunday, without disclosing the source. 


 It gave no further details and a Goldman spokesman could not be immediately reached for comment. Other global firms like the American International Group ( AIG.N ) and JPMorgan ( JPM.N ) are starting to do asset management business in India, where the mutual fund sector is growing fast. The assets of the Indian mutual fund industry stood at 3.4 trillion rupees ($77.15 billion) at the end of January, up 62 percent from a year earlier, according to the Association of Mutual Funds in India, a lobby group.
