 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Stock investors will look to earnings reports from retailers Federated Department Stores Inc. FD.N and Target Corp. ( TGT.N ) this week as well as new soundings on consumer sentiment as they to try to get a handle on the state of the U.S. economy. 


 The consumer sentiment data is just one piece of the puzzle in a week that is heavy with economic indicators. The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for February is due on Tuesday. A Reuters survey has economists forecasting a reading of 108.9, down a bit from 110.3 in January. On Friday, an update of the Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers for February will be released. The forecast: 93.5 versus 96.9 in January. "It might be interesting to compare the retail earnings and the consumer surveys," said Dan Bandi, chief investment officer for Integrity Asset Management in Independence, Ohio. While the retail earnings give a "backward look" at the economy, the consumer sentiment readings are more "real time," he said. Federated, the parent of Macy's and Bloomingdale's, and the No. 2 U.S. discount chain Target will report earnings on Tuesday. Quarterly results from Gap Inc. ( GPS.N ) and Kohl's Corp. ( KSS.N ) are due on Thursday. The price of oil will be watched closely after it hit a high for the year last week following Iran's defiance of a United Nations deadline to stop uranium enrichment. The West fears Iran will use uranium to make bombs. On Friday, crude oil for April delivery CLJ7 settled at $61.14 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest NYMEX closing price since late December. Gold hit a nine-month high, closer to $700 an ounce. FROM HOMES TO APPLIANCES Wall Street will tune in to Tuesday's data on U.S. existing home sales and Wednesday's report on new home sales, both for January. Consumers' optimism and their ability to take on debt play a major role in home sales. "One of the dark clouds for the stock market has been the housing industry," said Art Nunes, portfolio manager and market strategist for Portland, Oregon-based IMS Capital Management. But Nunes believes a recovery in housing is already under way, with the median price of homes sold actually rising a bit. Last week, worries about rising defaults on subprime mortgages -- home loans to customers with weaker credit histories -- continued to shake the U.S. stock market. For the past week, the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  lost 0.9 percent and the Standard & Poor's 500 index  .SPX  fell 0.3 percent. But the Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  finished the week up 0.8 percent, reflecting strength in semiconductor stocks. In the week ahead, Tuesday's data menu will include durable goods orders for January. Durable goods orders have a strong connection to consumers' willingness to spend because these products include refrigerators, washing machines and other big-ticket items meant to last three years or more. The consensus forecast is for a 2.5 percent drop in overall orders. But the expected decline is only 0.2 percent, excluding transportation. Another look at fourth-quarter gross domestic product is due on Wednesday. GDP is the output of all goods and services within U.S. borders. With consumer spending driving much of the U.S. economy, there is a strong connection between GDP growth and whether consumers are still in the mood to buy. The consensus forecast is for the revised fourth-quarter GDP data to show annual growth of 2.4 percent. An earlier report put the annual rate at 3.5 percent. Within the GDP report is the core personal consumption expenditures price index, or the core PCE price index. Forecast: Up 2.1 percent, steady with the previous reading. Another closely watched piece of economic data this week will be the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index on Wednesday and the Institute for Supply Management's survey of February manufacturing activity on Thursday. The ISM report is expected to show a reading of 50.0, up from 49.3 a month earlier. Personal income and spending data is also due on Thursday. The forecast: Incomes up 0.3 percent in January, compared with December's 0.5 percent increase. Core PCE price index, up 0.2 percent in January, after December's 0.1 percent gain. With the U.S. auto industry in a slump, February's domestic car and truck sales on Thursday will get attention. PLEASE PASS THE KETCHUP This week's earnings calendar includes H.J. Heinz Co. HNZ.N, known for its ketchup, steak sauce and Weight Watchers meals. Quarterly results also will be released by Dell Inc. DELL.O, the world's second-largest personal computer maker; American International Group Inc. ( AIG.N ), the world's largest insurer, and broadcaster CBS Corp. ( CBSa.N ). Reuters Estimates data on fourth-quarter earnings through February 16 shows earnings for Standard & Poor's 500 companies were up 10.7 percent from a year earlier. The data includes reported earnings and estimates for companies yet to report. Last week, strong earnings helped drive the Dow to a record close and the Nasdaq hit a six-year high. But stocks fell later in the week after strong inflation data revived concerns that an interest-rate cut was not coming soon. Still, there are many who think the stock market has built up a big enough head of steam that further gains are likely. "There's too much momentum to have a pullback in the near term," Bandi said. "My guess is that stocks stay pretty strong through the end of the quarter." Steve Goldman, market strategist at Weeden & Co. in Greenwich, Connecticut, said he believes "the market's underpinnings are still in pretty good shape, so it should provide support for stock prices at any modest setback. "Stocks probably will be supported, but it's tougher when you're at new highs to get excited at these levels." (Additional reporting by  Caroline Valetkevitch ) (Wall St Week Ahead runs weekly.
