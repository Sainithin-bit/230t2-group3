 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of German engineering conglomerate Siemens AG ( SIEGn.DE ) have been rising in recent months in spite of negative publicity and scandals as a new chief executive continues his restructuring, Barron's reported in its February 26 edition. 


 Siemens Chief Executive Klaus Kleinfeld has improved the performance of the company and also improved in-house controls to make illegal activity more difficult, Barron's said. This month a Siemens unit in the United States pleaded guilty to a federal criminal charge of obstruction of justice, Barron's said. There is no indication that Kleinfeld will be implicated in any scandal, according to the magazine.
