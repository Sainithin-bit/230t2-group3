 (Reuters) - Debt-laden JA Solar Holdings Co Ltd ( JASO.O ) said it received a warning from the Nasdaq that it could be delisted, making it the second solar company in less than a month to be put on notice by an exchange for failing to meet minimum share-price requirements. 
 The Chinese solar equipment maker failed to meet the exchange's criteria for continued listing as the average closing price of its American Depositary Shares was less than $1.00 over the preceding 30 trading days as of October 11, JA Solar said. Top solar panel maker Suntech Power Holdings Co Ltd STP.N received a similar notice last month from the New York Stock Exchange. JA Solar said it had until April 9 next year to address the stock price issue. The company, like its rivals, has been battling anti-dumping allegations in the United States and Europe, and a steep drop in solar panel prices. JA Solar shares closed at 80 cents on Monday.
