 (Reuters) - Gap Inc ( GPS.N ) is placing each of its divisions under a single global executive, the retailer said on Tuesday, as it recreates its model for its Old Navy unit. 
 The moves come after Gap had hired a number of new executives and revamped its management lineup in recent months under Chief Executive Officer Glenn Murphy. Starting November 5, Steve Sunnucks, who is international chief for the Gap brand, will become global president, while Art Peck, chief of Gap North America, will take over as president of the new innovation, digital strategy and new brands division. Toby Lenk, president of the online division, will leave in February, the company said in a statement. At Banana Republic, Jack Calhoun, president for North America, will become global president. The company had already begun the process at Old Navy, where Stefan Larsson, a former head of global sales at Hennes & Mauritz AB ( HMb.ST ), started earlier this month as global president. The company said CEO Murphy would oversee its Chinese business from now on, while Nancy Green, product leader for Old Navy, will take on a supporting role in China, with responsibility for guiding the product assortment and merchandise there. In September, Gap named Rebekka Bay as creative director and executive vice president for Gap global design and ex-J.C. Penney Co Inc ( JCP.N ) marketing chief Michael Francis as an adviser. Gap shares were up 0.9 percent at $36.60 in morning trading. (Reporting by  Nivedita Bhattacharjee  in Chicago; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Lisa Von Ahn)
