 ST. LOUIS  (Reuters) - Inflation expectations are "quite well anchored," giving the Federal Reserve breathing room for further possible rate cuts, but there is no clear evidence that a recession is at hand, a top Fed policy-maker said on Wednesday. 

 St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President William Poole said the Fed did not have to worry that rate cuts would allow inflation expectations to get out of hand. "Stable inflation expectations give the Federal Reserve a lot of room for maneuver," he told reporters after delivering a speech here. "If the evidence suggests that substantial policy easing is appropriate, I don't think we're going to face a risk of adverse inflation expectation consequences," he said. Poole emphasized that the odds of a U.S. recession "are certainly high enough to worry about, but I don't believe inflation risks are absent either." Oil has hit $100 a barrel and Poole warned higher energy prices could spread, while also noting that the country's employment position was still pretty strong despite a weak reading last month. The rate of U.S. unemployment jumped to 5 percent last month from 4.7 percent in November. "It was a weak number...(but) it was not a report of the sort that we saw in October, November and December 2001. In those three months we lost one million jobs. The report was not of that magnitude," Poole said, referring to the aftermath of the September 11 attacks on the United States. Poole, not a voting member of the Fed's interest rate setting committee this year, retires at the end of March. His successor at the head of the St. Louis Fed has yet to be named. The Fed has slashed its key interest rate a full percentage point since mid-September to 4.25 percent to shield the economy from a housing slump and credit crunch. Investors expect it will lower borrowing costs again at its next meeting, on January 29-30, but opinion is split on whether it will cut 25 or 50 basis points. RECESSION RISKS In earlier remarks to the Financial Planning Association of Missouri and Southern Illinois, Poole said the Fed would continue to watch both recession and inflation risks. "Recession risks are primarily a consequence of financial turmoil, which has threatened to spread housing industry woes to the broader economy," Poole said. "Will housing sector problems push the economy into recession? It is too early to tell right now, but what we can do is to examine the current situation closely and learn from it," he said in his speech, which mainly addressed the needs of better financial education. In conclusion, he struck a broadly optimistic tone in his speech, arguing that U.S. economic fundamentals were sound. "The current financial turmoil will take a while to play itself out. The fundamentals of our economy remain strong, however, and 2008 looks to be a year of rising growth. Economic forecasters expect slow expansion in the first half of the year and a quickening pace in the second half," he said. He also said that the dollar exchange rate would not go "way south" provided that the Fed maintained price stability, but cautioned that "predicting short-term exchange rate moves is a crap shoot." Poole said there was substantial uncertainly in the economic outlook, but the signs do not all point down. "We need to base our policy on the basis of what is happening. We know there are lots of things that might happen," Poole said. "I think it is a mistake ... to say that we clearly and unambiguously have evidence that a recession is at hand."
