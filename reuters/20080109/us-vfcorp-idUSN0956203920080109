 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Clothing company VF Corp ( VFC.N ) said on Wednesday it expected earnings per share to increase 10 percent in 2008, excluding the impact of any new acquisitions. 

 The company, whose brands include Wrangler, North Face, Vans and 7 For All Mankind, said it expected revenue to grow 9 percent this year. Wall Street analysts, on average, expect VF Corp to post 2008 earnings of $6.01 per share on revenue of $8.02 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. VF, which sells jeans that cost from $20 to $200, has cited its diverse portfolio for its good performance at a time when many other apparel manufacturers and retailers are warning of a difficult holiday season due to shoppers cutting back amid a weakened economy. The apparel company also said it expected to increase earnings per share 10 percent to 11 percent a year over the next five years. The company raised its five-year revenue growth target to a range of 8 percent to 10 percent from an earlier forecast of 6 percent to 8 percent, and expects to earn $11 billion in annual revenue by 2012. It expects growth to be driven by international expansion and its direct-to-consumer business. Growth of its existing lines is also expected to be augmented by acquisitions, which it expects to add 2 percent to 3 percent to annual growth over the five-year period. The company also anticipates continuing to pay out about 40 percent of its earnings to shareholders in the form of dividends over the next five years.
