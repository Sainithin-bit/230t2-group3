 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Restaurant chain Ruby Tuesday Inc ( RT.N ) posted a quarterly net loss, versus a year-ago profit, and said it could default on its debt, sending the company's stock down more than 3 percent in after-hours trade. 

 Ruby Tuesday recorded a net loss of $10.4 million, or 20 cents per share, in its fiscal second quarter ended December 4 as the company faced falling same-restaurant sales and remodeling costs. In the year-ago period, it had a net profit of $16.7 million, or 28 cents per share. The company said on Wednesday its remodeling initiative cost it 7 cents per share in the latest quarter. Quarterly revenue fell to $320.9 million from $336.8 million a year ago, as same-restaurant sales fell 10.8 percent at company-owned locations and 8.7 percent at franchise locations. Based on "the uncertainty of sales," Ruby Tuesday said it may become in violation of its debt covenants over the next year. "We are not currently in default but, because of accounting rules, we have reclassified much of our long-term debt as current," the company said in a statement. "We will be working with our lenders to obtain a modification of covenants for future periods and expect a favorable outcome." Ruby Tuesday shares fell to $7 in after-hours trading, after closing down about 6 percent at $7.24 on Nasdaq. For fiscal 2008, the company said it expects earnings of 40 cents to 60 cents per share, and same-restaurant sales to fall 6 percent to 8.5 percent at company-owned restaurants. The full-year outlook includes projected expenses of 16 cents to 18 cents per share related to the remodeling. (Reporting by  Martinne Geller ; Editing by  Andre Grenon ,  Richard Chang )
