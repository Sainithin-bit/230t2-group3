 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Aluminum producer Alcoa Inc said on Wednesday that fourth-quarter net profit rose 76 percent on favorable restructuring and tax benefits, offsetting lower aluminum prices. 

 The results came in ahead of expectations, sending Alcoa shares up 2.4 percent in after-hours trading. Net income increased to $632 million, or 75 cents per share, from $359 million, or 41 cents per share, in the year-ago period. The company recorded a benefit of 38 cents per share in the most recent quarter related to its agreement to sell its packaging and consumer business. Before items, the company earned 36 cents per share. On that basis, analysts, on average, expected 34 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue dropped to $7.39 billion from $7.84 billion due to lower metal prices and the loss of revenue from its soft alloy extrusion business, which is now part of a joint venture. Alcoa said operating income for its alumina business declined partly due to higher freight and energy costs and unfavorable currency rates. "We battled substantially higher material input and energy costs and currency impacts, while simultaneously continuing to execute on the largest capital investment program in our history," said Chairman and Chief Executive Alain Belda. On Monday, Credit Suisse lowered its profit outlook for the company, citing lower aluminum prices, adverse currency and energy price changes and more pronounced weakness in certain downstream markets. Since trading at $2,659 per ton on the London Metal Exchange last November 7, the price of aluminum has slipped and is currently selling for around $2,500 per ton.
