 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - MBIA Inc ( MBI.N ), the world's largest bond insurer, slashed its dividend by 62 percent on Wednesday and said it would sell $1 billion of debt to preserve capital and the "triple-A" ratings it needs to operate normally in a mortgage market under siege. 

 The company also said it would report $737 million of losses in the fourth quarter, largely for securities made up of high-quality residential home equity loans. It also revealed it is cooperating with informal inquiries by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and New York State insurance department into its December disclosures related to mortgage and other debt exposure, and a $500 million infusion from private equity firm Warburg Pincus LLC WP.UL Shares of MBIA fell 55 cents, or 3.9 percent, to close at $13.40, while rival Ambac Financial Group Inc ABK.N shed 17 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $19.25. Both had earlier plummeted more than 20 percent to levels not seen in more than a decade. "People were spooked," said Rob Haines, an analyst at CreditSights Inc. "The talks may have sparked concern the Warburg deal might not go through, or that there are regulatory concerns that investors aren't aware of. With bond insurers, investors will latch onto negative news because it is such an out-of-favor industry." The bond insurers are also facing a new rival, Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway Inc ( BRKa.N ) ( BRKb.N ) said on Wednesday it has begun offering its own bond insurance. PRESERVING TRIPLE-A MBIA said it is cutting its quarterly dividend to 13 cents per share from 34 cents, saving $80 million a year. C. Edward Chaplin, chief financial officer of the Armonk, New York-based company, said in a statement the lowered dividend "significantly enhances our financial flexibility." The debt sale, meanwhile, won approval from Fitch Ratings, which said it would end its threat to take away MBIA's triple-A financial strength rating if the sale went through. It said the sale would "effectively address the existing capital deficiency" and fix potential capital shortfalls related to exposure to lower-quality, subprime home loans. The rating agency threatened to downgrade MBIA last month after the company surprised investors by saying it guaranteed $8.1 billion of particularly risky mortgage securities. "It's good news for MBIA," said Jim Ryan, an equity analyst for Morningstar Inc in Chicago. "Most of the stock's recent decline stemmed from fear it wouldn't be able to raise enough capital to keep the triple-A rating. That issue now seems to be put to bed." Fitch and larger rival Standard & Poor's rated the new MBIA debt "AA," their third-highest grade. Moody's Investors Service rated it an equivalent "Aa2." The debt matures in 2033. MBIA shares have tumbled 81 percent in the last year as rising mortgage defaults left investors worried the company would be unable to cover potential losses easily. Bond insurers guarantee about $2.5 trillion of debt overall. A rating downgrade for MBIA could lead to falling prices on the roughly $673 billion of bonds it insures, leading investors who need triple-A ratings to look elsewhere. BUFFETT Buffett could benefit. Last month, he started Berkshire Hathaway Assurance Corp to insure debt issued by state and local governments. That unit said on Wednesday it won its first mandate, guaranteeing $10 million of New York City debt. Ryan said that even if MBIA and Ambac keep their triple-A ratings for now, they aren't out of the woods with the U.S. housing slump expected to worsen, perhaps beyond 2008. "The main concern has been a lack of reserves to cover increased defaults from insurance of mortgage-related derivatives, primarily CDOs (collateralized debt obligations)," Ryan said. "Elevated claims would eat into future profitability and force them to add reserves, taking away from capital." Warburg Pincus agreed last month to invest $500 million in MBIA stock, receive warrants to buy additional shares, and backstop a $500 million rights offering. Michael Moriarty, deputy superintendent for capital markets at New York's insurance department, said his office is in "close" talks with MBIA, and "will work with financial guarantors ... to facilitate their capital raising efforts." SEC spokesman Kevin Callahan declined to comment.
