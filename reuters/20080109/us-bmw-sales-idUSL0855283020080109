 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - BMW ( BMWG.DE ) kept its title as the world's largest premium carmaker in 2007 as sporty models like the 3 Series cabrio and X5 offroader and the stylish new Mini Clubman lifted group sales by 9.2 percent last year. 

 The 1.5 million vehicles delivered to customers surpassed archrival Mercedes-Benz Cars ( DAIGn.DE ) for the fourth straight year, which reported on Tuesday sales of its models rose 2 percent to 1.286 million units. BMW said on Wednesday group sales in December alone jumped 18.2 percent to 152,721 models. BMW brand sales rose 14.5 percent to 131,732 units, while Mini brand sales swelled 48.6 percent to 20,800 cars. Deliveries of Rolls-Royce limousines rose 16 percent to 189 units. For all of 2007, BMW brand sales rose 7.7 percent to 1.28 million, Mini sales gained 18.5 percent to 222,875 cars, and Rolls-Royce sales gained 25.5 percent to 1,010 units. "Overall, the BMW group is once again the world's leading supplier in the premium automobile segment in terms of volume sales. We are optimistic that we will reach this top position again in 2008," sales and marketing head Stefan Krause said. BMW had forecast 2007 group sales would rise by a high single-digit percentage, mainly following a surge of demand in the second half of the year on the back of planned model launches. Its shares fell 1.6 percent to 41.32 euros by 0946 GMT while the DJ Stoxx European car sector index retreated 1.3 percent. (Editing by Sue Thomas)
