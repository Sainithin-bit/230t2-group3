 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - News Corp NWSa.N chief operating officer said on Wednesday that U.S. economic woes are not having any effect on the media conglomerate's business. 

 "We are seeing no signs of any slowdown in our business," Peter Chernin said at a Citi conference in Phoenix, Arizona, adding that the company is "not unmindful" of wider economic troubles. "Obviously we live in the world, and <Chief Executive> Rupert Murdoch lives in the world, and God knows I'm sure everybody here is buzzing about the economy and where we're headed," he said.
