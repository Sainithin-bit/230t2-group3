 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Airbus has won an order worth $6.9 billion from leasing company AWAS Ltd for as many as 100 planes, The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. 

 The report comes after a year of strong sales. Louis Gallois, chief executive of Airbus's parent, EADS ( EAD.PA ), said earlier this week that the company was at the "peak of the cycle." Rival Boeing Co ( BA.N ) recently posted an industry record 1,413 net plane orders for 2007, worth about $170 billion at list prices. Airbus reports its tally in the next two weeks. The Journal report quoted Airbus executive John Leahy as saying that the upcoming announcement will not include the AWAS deal, which Airbus will book for this year. Representatives from Airbus and AWAS were not immediately available for comment. (Reporting by  Ritsuko Ando ; Editing by Paul Bolding)
