 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - AT&T Inc ( T.N ) said on Tuesday it saw softness in its consumer business, spooking investors who thought telecoms would be sheltered from the U.S. economic slowdown and helping drive the Standard & Poor's 500 stocks index to its worst five-day start to a year ever. 

 Shares of AT&T -- which were among the strongest blue-chip performers in the U.S. market last year, with a 16 percent gain -- fell as much as 10 percent in late trading before recovering to close down 4.78 percent at $39.07. "We're experiencing softness on the consumer side of the house from the economy," AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson told a Citigroup investor conference in a presentation that was broadcast over the Web. Stephenson said the main impact was on home phones and Internet services, while wireless would be the last thing consumers surrender. His comments sparked a new round of recession fears, contributing to a loss of nearly 2 percent in both the Dow Jones Industrial Average  .DJI  and the S&P 500 index  .SPX . The S&P 500 Index lost 25.99 points to end at 1,390.19, capping a 5.32 percent slide over the first five trading sessions of 2008 -- its worst such start on record. The Dow fell 238.42 points to 12,589.07. "Up to now, the telcos have put on a very brave face and have suggested that they haven't really seen any signs of economic weakness. That's really reinforced the idea that telcos are the ideal defenses," said Craig Moffett, analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. "Today's comment by Randall Stephenson is the first crack in that armor and suggests that maybe the old view that telcos are immune to the economy just doesn't hold true anymore." Verizon Communications Inc ( VZ.N ), the second-largest U.S. phone company after AT&T, fell 2.73 percent to $41.75. Qwest Communications International Inc ( Q.N ) dropped 5.82 percent to $6.15, while Sprint Nextel Corp ( S.N ) fell 3.24 percent to $12.53. Cable companies like Comcast Corp ( CMCSA.O ) and Time Warner Cable Inc ( TWC.N ) also fell more than 2 percent. Both companies are now major phone service providers to consumers. The U.S. economy has been under pressure since the summer due to tightening of credit markets, a weakening housing market and poor job data. "It's bad for everybody, maybe, not just telcos," said Tom Watts, analyst at Cowen & Co. "There's been differing opinion on whether we're heading into a recession but this is a sign that we're seeing economic impact and consumer weakness." Some wireless executives at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas said cell phones have become a necessity, even during economic downturns. When asked about economic risks, Sprint Nextel Corp ( S.N ) Chief Technology Officer Barry West said he had not seen any signs of a pullback so far. "I really don't see it," West said in an interview with Reuters at the show. But a Samsung Electronics ( 005930.KS ) executive said on Sunday its carrier customers had seen slowing sales toward the end of the December holiday period. He did not name the carriers and said the reason for the slowdown was not clear. A spokesman for AT&T said on Tuesday Stephenson was talking about what the company saw in December when he referred to consumer softness. "Our forecast has not changed. Consumer is a relatively small part of the business and our overall guidance has not changed," said AT&T spokesman Michael Coe, noting consumers accounted for less than 20 percent of AT&T's revenue.
