 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's Hitachi Ltd ( 6501.T ) said on Tuesday it would expand plasma TV distribution channels in China and cut some in the United States and Europe. 

 Japan's biggest industrial electronics company also said it expected raw materials prices to lower operating profit by 40 billion yen in the year through March 2009, and a stronger yen to lower profit by 60 billion yen. (Reporting by  Mayumi Negishi )
