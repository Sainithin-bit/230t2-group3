 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The chief financial officer of Wal-Mart Stores Inc said on Tuesday that the retailer is being "appropriately conservative" with its fiscal second-quarter forecast. 

 "These are volatile times and we want to make sure that we run our stores conservatively," said Chief Financial Officer Tom Schoewe in an interview with Reuters. Earlier in the day, Wal-Mart forecast earnings per share of 78 to 81 cents for its second quarter. Analysts on average are expecting 81 cents. Schoewe also said the retailer has slowed repurchases of its shares as its stock price has risen. Through Monday, its shares are up 22 percent this year. Schoewe also said that the retailer is "concerned" about the current price of gasoline. "These are high prices," he said. On a recorded call earlier in the day, Wal-Mart executives said higher transportation costs would remain a "potential headwind" for the rest of the year.
