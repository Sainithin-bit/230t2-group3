 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co ( 7201.T ) Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn said on Tuesday the company's operating margin should be at 8 percent in a "neutral" environment free of extreme swings in currency rates and commodity prices. 

 "If the company is well-managed ... the operating margin should be 8 percent," he told a news conference, adding that if currency rates were favorable, Nissan should achieve a higher level and vice versa. (Reporting by  Chang-Ran Kim )
