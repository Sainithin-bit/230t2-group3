 LONDON  (Reuters) - French bank Credit Agricole joined the growing list of lenders asking shareholders for billions of euros in extra cash while a trio of other European banks also revealed new scars from the credit crunch on Tuesday. 

 Agricole, France's biggest retail bank, announced a 5.9 billion euros ($9.1 billion) rights issue due to further writedowns at its Calyon investment banking arm of 1.2 billion euros during the first quarter.  French rival Societe Generale, Belgian-Dutch group Fortis and Britain's Alliance & Leicester also revealed combined writedowns of almost $3 billion as the impact of the U.S. housing market crisis and subsequent credit crunch spread further across Europe. After taking big hits, banks are asking shareholders to rebuild their capital cushion as the threat of further losses looms and banks' ability to rebuild their balance sheet will be hampered by reduced earnings in coming years. Agricole shares were down 6 percent by 5:00 a.m. EDT (0900 GMT), while Alliance & Leicester tumbled 9 percent and SocGen and Fortis were off by more than 1 percent. The DJ European bank index was down 0.7 percent. Speculation about big losses at Agricole and the ousting of Calyon Chief Executive Marc Litzler has gathered pace in recent days, forcing the bank to bring forward headline earnings by two days. Agricole's statement made no mention of Litzler's position, but a banking industry source close to Calyon told Reuters on Monday that media reports of Litzler's departure were "realistic". Agricole said it planned to lower Calyon's risk profile and cut costs at the division. U.S. and European banks have typically taken far bigger writedowns for the first quarter than they did for all of 2007, after markets deteriorated sharply in March and lenders take a more conservative stance to draw a line under losses. UBS, Royal Bank of Scotland and Deutsche Bank have added to multi-billion euro writedowns by warning that earnings prospects are grim this year, especially for investment banking revenue. CUSHION NEEDED SocGen reported a 23 percent fall in first quarter profit after a plunge in its profit from investment banking.  Britain's Alliance & Leicester showed that even without an investment bank arm, big writedowns are possible as lenders suffer from deteriorating economies and weakened housing markets. A&L took a 192 million pound writedown on the value of risky assets it holds in its treasury portfolio, after a 185 million pound hit last year. Higher funding costs due to restricted lending among banks also continue to take a big bite out of its profits and put its dividend in danger.  Capital, the buffer a bank keeps to protect depositors against future shocks, is being rebuilt by banks after being depleted from writedowns and after seeing banks with strong balance sheets being rewarded by investors. Those already tapping shareholders include Switzerland's UBS, Britain's Royal Bank of Scotland and HBOS and Portugal's BPI. SocGen is raising 5.5 billion euros to cover trading losses it unveiled in January, blamed on rogue deals by trader Jerome Kerviel. On top of losses already made, banks are also preparing for a more difficult future. RBS Chief Executive Fred Goodwin said at a conference in New York late on Monday that his bank's capital base had been adequate in past years, but it was "of a time and of an era which have been overtaken by events". "The message ... is our capital base needs to be strong to be able to absorb impacts where things could have turned out much worse than they have," Goodwin said.
