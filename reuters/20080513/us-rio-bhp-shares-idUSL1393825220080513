 LONDON/PARIS  (Reuters) - Shares in miner Rio Tinto ( RIO.L ) rose nearly 4 percent to their day's high on Tuesday on market talk that BHP Billiton ( BLT.L ) was planning to offer 3.8 of its shares for every Rio share in a takeover bid, traders said. 

 BHP declined to comment. At 1419 GMT (10:19 a.m. EDT), Rio shares were up 3.5 percent at 66.42 pounds, making it the top gainer on Britain's FTSE benchmark  .FTSE , which was down 0.2 percent. Over 90 percent of the 30-day daily average volume in Rio had changed hands by 1418 GMT (10:18 a.m. EDT), compared with about 65 percent on the FTSE 100. BHP was up 2.3 percent.
