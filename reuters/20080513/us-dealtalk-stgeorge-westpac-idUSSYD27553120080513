 MELBOURNE  (Reuters) - The largest banking takeover in Australia's corporate history has spurred investors to pile into shares of smaller banks in the hope of a sector shake-out. 

 Westpac Banking Corp Ltd's ( WBC.AX ) $17.6 billion all-share bid for smaller rival St George Bank Ltd SGB.AX would create the country's biggest bank by market value, possibly spurring one of the other major banks to bid for a smaller regional lender. Other scenarios suggested by analysts included the merger of two regional banks, or a rival major attempting to block the St George deal. "It's the infectiousness about the takeover. Regional banks are being watched because of the need for the major banks to reap greater efficiencies in the face of the uncertainties around the world," said Austock senior client adviser Michael Heffernan. Australia's banking sector is governed by the "four pillars" policy, which prevents the four biggest banks -- which account for about 70 percent of total banking assets -- from merging with each other. Fourth-ranked Westpac skirts that restriction with its bid for No.5 St George, but investors are speculating another big bank may be provoked into pursuing a lender with a large regional presence.  The new Labor government is likely to be reluctant to amend the "four pillars" despite challenges from bankers, because it would decrease competition and lead to widespread job cuts. Shares of potential regional targets soared for a second day, though analysts were more skeptical than investors that a deal would emerge. "The view is they are more likely takeover targets," said Tyndall Investment Management fund manager Craig Young. "But the price you would pay is pretty full. With the regionals you are paying a lot for businesses that are less profitable (than St George), from a return on equity perspective." After rallying 7.4 percent on Monday, Bendigo and Adelaide Bank Ltd ( BEN.AX ) surged 7.6 percent on Tuesday to its highest since January 2, while Bank of Queensland ( BOQ.AX ) jumped 5.6 percent on Tuesday, adding to a 5.8 percent rise, to a six-week high. Bendigo and Adelaide Bank emerged from a A$1.6 billion merger last year of Bendigo Bank and Adelaide Bank and has assets around A$50 billion, while Bank of Queensland has about A$28 billion in assets. Bank and insurer Suncorp Metway Ltd ( SUN.AX ), which earlier this year was seen as a potential target for Westpac, fell 2.8 percent, partly because its insurance business is seen as less attractive for a bank to integrate. It is the country's second-biggest home and car insurer, and sixth biggest bank. Australia also has dozens of very small local lenders which would not be worth pursuing for a large bank. St George's size will catapult the combined Westpac into top position by market value. Regional banks with a much smaller market value, smaller market share and asset base would not provide such a boost. "It's more likely that some of the minor banks may decide to get together, or they may decide to look at linkages they can make maybe with the backing of an offshore player," said White Funds Management portfolio manager Angus Gluskie. "St George had the image of a personalized bank and if that disappeared, smaller players could come in and replace that particular offering in the Australian marketplace." Australian banks have mostly dodged the subprime credit woes afflicting global banks, although several have exposure to some troubled local firms. But the credit crunch has pushed up funding costs, particularly for the smaller banks. "The domestic banks might continue to search for alternate growth opportunities," said ABN AMRO analyst Jarrod Martin in a note to clients. National Australia Bank Ltd ( NAB.AX ), the largest by assets, owns UK banks Yorkshire Bank and Clydesdale Bank and is expanding lending to agricultural businesses in the United States. Cash-strapped Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd ( ANZ.AX ) is pursuing acquisitions in Asia. Most analysts do not expect the other major banks to try to enter a bidding war for St George, partly because they are pursuing different growth strategies. St George entered into "no shop" and "no talk" agreements that prevent it from cooperating with another bidder. Competition hurdles and weaker share prices would also hamper a rival bid. "Westpac is in the best position, their scrip is trading at a better premium than the others and they have a decent capital position," said Tyndall's Young. Still, a rival could try to spoil the St George deal by buying up a blocking stake. Analysts at GSJBWere told clients that spending around A$2 billion to buy a 10 percent blocking stake "appears a real option" to ensure that another firm's strategic options would remain intact.
