 (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co ( 7203.T ), Japan's No.3 automaker, announced on Tuesday a new business strategy plan called Nissan GT 2012 -- "G" for growth and "T" for trust -- to run for the five years to March 2013. 

 Some targets under a previous plan have yet to be met after Nissan delayed their completion last year. Following is the gist of the automaker's plans: -- Quality: In addition to focusing on product quality, Nissan said it would continue and accelerate improvements in service, brand and management quality. -- Zero-emission vehicles: As announced earlier, Nissan will introduce an all-electric vehicle in the United States and Japan in 2010 and then mass-market the vehicles to consumers globally in 2012. -- Five percent revenue growth on average over five years, supported by planned launch of 60 all-new models. -- Business expansion: Infiniti, light commercial vehicles and global entry cars -- Market expansion: India, Middle East, Brazil, Russia and China -- Per-share dividend of 42 yen in 2008/09, 44 yen in 2009/10, 46 yen in 2010/11. Chief Executive Officer Carlos Ghosn said dividend plans for the final two years will be announced in 2010. (Reporting by  Chang-Ran Kim ; Editing by  Hugh Lawson )
