 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Just months after moving to Westpac Banking Corp ( WBC.AX ), Gail Kelly, the first woman to run a top-10 company in Australia, has wowed the industry with a bold bid to buy her former employer St George Bank Ltd SGB.AX. 

 If the deal goes through, Kelly could be heading Australia's top bank and third-biggest listed company. "Gail getting into Westpac puts her in a prime seat for taking over St George early on in her stay there," said Peter Vann, head of investment research at Constellation Capital Management. "St George is ripe for a takeover by a larger player and this just seems such a natural fit given the background and the people involved," said Vann, who owns shares in both banks. Westpac, Australia's fourth-largest and oldest bank dating back to 1817, said on Monday it was in talks about an all-scrip offer for fifth-ranked St George, which has a market capitalization of $14 billion.  Under Kelly, a former bank teller and schoolteacher from South Africa, who is now Australia's highest paid business woman, St George more than doubled its assets to over A$100 billion ($94 billion) and more than doubled profits to above A$1 billion. St George, which was a building society until 1992, also emerged as Australia's fastest-growing lender to small businesses, all achieved through organic growth. Kelly, 52, was at St George for five and a half years. Focused on customer service, St George topped customer satisfaction surveys time after time during her tenure. Kelly's innovations also include allowing employees to work at 80 percent of salary for four years, then having the fifth year off also at 80 percent of salary. "What Gail is planning to do (at Westpac) is a threat to the other big banks' market share. Regardless of taking over St George, she's seen some room for improvement at Westpac ... which will potentially chip away at the other big three banks' retail base," said Vann. Kelly, who has four children including triplets, came to Australia in 1997 from South Africa and joined top lender Commonwealth Bank of Australia ( CBA.AX ), where she was head of customer service before being recruited by St George after its Chief Ed O'Neal died of a heart attack. Westpac had searched for around a year to replace its former chief David Morgan, who was with the company 18 years. Kelly was the first Australian bank chief executive to switch to a rival. Kelly taught Latin in Zimbabwe while her husband, pediatrician Allan, served in the Rhodesian army, later teaching at a government high school in South Africa before working as a bank teller at Nedcor Bank. Kelly, who has admitted "I tend not to sleep as much as I perhaps should," was promoted to head of Nedcor's human resources in 1990, five months after her triplets were born. "I thought: 'Can I do this? I've got four children under three, how can I possibly take up a general manager role?' But I decided I would always look back and regret that I hadn't had a go. So I ... never looked back," she has been quoted as saying. "If you don't try, you'll never know if you can do it or not." ($1-A$1.06) (Editing by  Ian Geoghegan )
