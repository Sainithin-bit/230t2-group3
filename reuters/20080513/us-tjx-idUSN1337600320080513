 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - TJX Cos Inc ( TJX.N ) posted higher quarterly profit on Tuesday, but its stock, which had rallied a day earlier, fell more than 4 percent due to a second-quarter forecast range whose high end met, but did not exceed, Wall Street estimates. 

 Nevertheless, the off-price retailer, which should benefit from warmer weather in the second quarter, is likely to beat its own outlook, said one analyst. "I think the stock is unnecessarily down and I think it represents a buying opportunity," said CL King analyst Mark Montagna. "I think they're being conservative and I think they always try to outperform their guidance," he added. The operator of chains including T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, HomeGoods and A.J. Wright said net profit was $193.8 million, or 43 cents per share, in the fiscal first quarter that ended April 26, compared with $162.1 million, or 34 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding a tax benefit, earnings were 41 cents a share, matching the average analyst forecast compiled by Reuters Estimates. The retailer also said operating margins fell to 6.6 percent, from 6.9 percent a year earlier, excluding one-time charges a year ago, and was slightly below the company's expectations. The company, which buys excess merchandise in bulk at below-wholesale prices, said selling, general and administrative expenses were flat. Sales rose 6 percent to $4.36 billion, while sales at stores open at least a year, or comparable-store sales, rose 3 percent. "It's a really tough environment. Comps were (up) only 3 percent. They managed expenses well," said Richard Jaffe, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. TJX executives have said their business is not as adversely affected as other retailers' in the weaker economy as consumers trade down and search out deals to save money, amid rising gasoline and food prices. Nevertheless, cold weather and "challenges of the consumer environment" affected results during the quarter, Chief Executive Carol Meyrowitz. "We maintained our inventory disciplines, which allowed us to mitigate our markdown risks and put us in an excellent position to take advantage of great buying opportunities in the marketplace," Meyrowitz said during a conference call with analysts. The company, which is expanding internationally, forecast second-quarter earnings of 40 cents to 42 cents a share, and a 3 percent rise in same-store sales. For the full year, it stood by its prior forecast for earnings of $2.20 to $2.25 a share, including the benefit of an extra week when compared with the previous year. Analysts on average forecast second-quarter earnings of 42 cents a share and full-year earnings of $2.22 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. TJX shares, which hit a 52-week high of $34.93 in March, fell $1.52, or 4.7 percent, to $30.60 on the New York Stock Exchange in afternoon trading. On Monday, TJX shares rose $1.10. "At this point investors are very focused on larger cap retailers. They've been the most resilient in terms of share price," said analyst Montagna, who has an "accumulate" rating on TJX shares. "Here's a large-cap company, they've done very well and I would expect that to continue." (Additional reporting by  Brad Dorfman , editing by Maureen Bavdek)
