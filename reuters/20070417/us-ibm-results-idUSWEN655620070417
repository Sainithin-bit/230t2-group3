 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp. ( IBM.N ), the world's largest technology services company, said on Tuesday that quarterly profit rose 8 percent on higher sales of software and computer services. 

 Net income rose to $1.84 billion, or $1.21 per share, matching Wall Street estimates. A year earlier, it earned $1.71 billion, or $1.08 per share. Revenue climbed 6.6 percent to $22.03 billion from $20.66 billion a year earlier and topped expectations of $21.9 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Following the earnings report in after-hours trading, IBM shares slipped 91 cents to $96.21 after closing up 1 percent. "The worry going into the quarter was sluggishness (in) server spending, but the fact that IBM pulled off the quarter shows that the diversified portfolio of businesses is working," said Sunil Reddy, senior portfolio manager at Fifth Third Asset Management, which oversees about $21 billion, including IBM shares. The company stood by its January forecast of full-year earnings-per-share growth of 10 percent to 12 percent, adding that growth would likely be around 11 percent. IBM Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge told analysts on a conference call that weakness in the United States was more than offset by strong sales in Asia and in Europe, especially in Germany. IBM paid nearly $5 billion for 13 acquisitions to boost sales of software and services last year, part of a strategy to improve profitability by selling more software-based services. IBM said revenue at its two services businesses, which accounted for more than one-half of total sales in 2006, rose 8 percent in the quarter. Services signings, a key indicator of future revenue, slipped to $11.1 billion from $11.4 billion. Revenue at one services unit, Global Business Services, increased 8.7 percent to $4.2 billion. It was the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year pretax profit growth for the business, reflecting IBM's push to sell more-profitable software-based services. Revenue at the other services unit, Global Technology Services, rose 7 percent to $8.3 billion. The first unit includes consulting and managing of customers' business software, while the other is involved in outsourcing and computer maintenance. First-quarter services deals included a $775 million contract to manage information technology for more than 600 Circuit City CC.N stores. IBM, of Armonk, New York, also signed a $700 million extension of a contract with Germany's Sparkassen Informatik GmbH, which handles information technology for savings banks. Software revenue rose 8.8 percent to $4.25 billion in the first quarter, helped by strong sales of IBM's middleware software for running corporate data networks. Middleware is a layer of software that connects applications or components. Sales of hardware, including microprocessors and servers and storage gear for businesses, rose 2.3 percent to $4.52 billion. The stock closed up 94 cents at $97.12 on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares are down 2.3 percent this year amid investor concern over revenue and profit growth for 2007. The stock trades at about 14 times estimated 2007 earnings per share, compared with an average multiple of about 15 for companies on the Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX , including competitor Hewlett-Packard Co.
