 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Core inflation dipped in March and groundbreaking for new homes rose slightly as the economy demonstrated anew an ability to keep growing without generating surging prices. 

 The Labor Department on Tuesday said its monthly Consumer Price Index climbed 0.6 percent after a 0.4 percent February rise. But core prices, which exclude food and energy, were up only 0.1 percent after larger gains of 0.2 percent in February and 0.3 percent in January. Economist David Sloan of 4CAST Ltd. in New York said gains in core prices now seemed to be on an encouraging downward trend. "We saw slightly disappointing core CPI numbers in January and February and I think this is a correction, which means the trend is fairly stable," he said. Share prices measured by the Dow Jones industrial average gained 52.58 points to close at 12,773.04, partly because investors felt encouraged by the modest core price rise. But the high tech-laden Nasdaq composite index shed 1.38 points to close 2,516.95. Bond prices also gained on hope that moderate core inflation meant U.S. official interest rates were less likely to rise, and could possibly fall, later in the year. The bellwether 10-year U.S. Treasury note jumped 12/32 in price, pushing yields down to 4.69 percent from 4.74 percent late on Monday. Two-year notes US2YT=RR, which are considered especially sensitive to market views on Federal Reserve policy, traded up 4/32 in price, pushing yields down to 4.68 percent. Separately, the Commerce Department said housing starts rose to an annual pace of 1.518 million units in March from a revised 1.506 million unit pace in February. FACTORIES BUSIER Another report from the Federal Reserve said industrial production unexpectedly eased 0.2 percent in March, primarily because utilities output eased after big gains in February that were spurred by cold weather. The manufacturing component of industrial output gained a healthy 0.7 percent after a slight 0.1 percent rise in February, which analysts saw as another sign of the economy's durability. "Manufacturing has been sporadic, and this is a solid sign that we are not turning the corner downwards given the problems in housing," said Kurt Karl, chief U.S. economist at Swiss Re in New York. ENERGY PRICES UP The overall rise in consumer prices was the largest since a matching 0.6 percent surge last April but financial markets focused on the small gain in core prices. Energy costs were the main driver in the overall rise in consumer prices. Gasoline prices jumped 10.6 percent, eclipsing a slim 0.3 percent gain in February. It was the largest increase in gasoline prices since a 17.4 percent gain in September 2005. Fed policy-makers have been wary about the potential for a rise in inflation pressures, maintaining that the core rate has been uncomfortably high so March's slight pickup may be reassuring. The president of the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank, Charles Plosser, said the smaller rise in core prices was helpful but needs to be extended. "The important question is whether it will continue," Plosser told reporters after delivering a speech in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. Analysts say higher energy prices tend not to be passed through into consumers' expectations about inflation. Nonetheless, consumers still must buy food and fuel and that leaves less for spending on other goods. The Labor Department said that during this year's first quarter, overall consumer prices increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.7 percent, nearly twice the 2.5 percent gain for all of 2006. Stiffer energy costs accounted for 41 percent of the overall increase in first-quarter consumer prices, the department said. Two reports on chain stores -- from the International Council of Shopping Centers and UBS Securities and the Johnson Redbook Retail Sales Index -- showed weak sales so far in April.
