 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Several U.S. regional banks reported weak earnings on Tuesday amid struggles with interest-rate pressures and rising loan losses, including those from mortgages. 

 Wells Fargo & Co. ( WFC.N ), the fifth-largest U.S. bank, bucked the trend, boosting profit 11 percent despite its large exposure. Profit also rose 13 percent at Regions Financial Corp. ( RF.N ), the eighth-largest bank. Earnings fell 2 percent at U.S. Bancorp ( USB.N ) and 3 percent at SunTrust Banks Inc. ( STI.N ), respectively the sixth- and seventh-largest banks, and 20 percent at Washington Mutual Inc. ( WM.N ), the largest savings and loan. KeyCorp ( KEY.N ) cut its 2007 profit forecast, sending its shares down 5.8 percent. "It has been a mixed bag," said Mark Batty, an analyst at PNC Wealth Management in Philadelphia. "There have been net interest margin pressures, and loan losses have been increasing, though not to eye-opening levels. Banks with capital markets and asset management exposure have performed better, as have banks that manage costs efficiently." Tuesday's results, on balance, were weaker than those posted Monday by Citigroup Inc. ( C.N ) and Wachovia Corp. WB.N, which have more broadly diversified operations and have emphasized keeping costs down. Shares of Wells Fargo closed down 26 cents, or 0.7 percent, at $35.25; U.S. Bancorp fell 34 cents, or 1 percent, to $34.56; SunTrust rose $2.03, or 2.5 percent, to $83.40, and Regions fell 37 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $34.23. KeyCorp slid $2.22 to $36.36. Washington Mutual fell 60 cents, or 1.5 percent, at $40.13, but rose 2.9 percent after-hours as results topped forecasts. WELLS FARGO, U.S. BANCORP Net income for San Francisco-based Wells Fargo rose to a record $2.24 billion, or 66 cents per share, from $2.02 billion, or 60 cents, a year earlier. Revenue rose 10 percent to $9.44 billion. Analysts, on average, had forecast profit of 65 cents per share on revenue of $9.31 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Wells Fargo's largest investor is Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. ( BRKa.N ) ( BRKb.N ). The bank said commercial lending grew 11 percent, helping offset a $124 million write-off from a decline in the value of some mortgages to higher-risk borrowers. Credit losses rose 65 percent, but analysts and the bank said trends are manageable. Mortgage applications grew 19 percent, suggesting the bank is winning market share. "We are a responsible lender," Chief Financial Officer Howard Atkins said in an interview. "We try to make sure we bring people into loans only if they can afford them." Net income for Minneapolis-based U.S. Bancorp dipped to $1.13 billion, or 63 cents per share, from $1.15 billion, or 63 cents, a year earlier. Analysts, on average, had expected 65 cents. Credit losses increased 54 percent. Net interest margin, the difference between what the bank earns on loans and pays on deposits, fell to 3.51 percent from 3.80 percent a year earlier. Chief Executive Richard Davis said it may fall further, in a "less than favorable environment." Wells Fargo and U.S. Bancorp operate mainly in the western two-thirds of the United States. SUNTRUST, WAMU, REGIONS, KEYCORP At Atlanta-based SunTrust, profit fell to $513.9 million, or $1.44 per share, from $531.5 million, or $1.46. Core earnings excluding items fell short of some analyst forecasts. Mortgage profit plunged 90 percent to $7.5 million, reflecting lower margins on loan sales and higher write-offs for near-prime loans. Shares rose after SunTrust said it is making progress on a $400 million cost-cutting plan. Profit at Seattle-based Washington Mutual fell to $784 million, or 86 cents per share, from $985 million, or 98 cents, topping forecasts by 2 cents per share. Rising profits in retail banking and credit cards offset higher credit costs and a $113 million loss from a home loan unit. Net income for Birmingham, Alabama-based Regions rose to $333 million from $294.7 million, helped by the November purchase of AmSouth Bancorp Inc. Excluding items, profit was 69 cents per share, topping forecasts by 2 cents per share. Cleveland-based KeyCorp said profit rose 21 percent to $350 million, or 87 cents per share, but missed forecasts by 3 cents per share excluding items. KeyCorp projected full-year profit of $2.80 to $2.95 per share, down from a January forecast of $3.00 to $3.10. "It's primarily related to the interest rate environment," Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey Weeden said. (Additional reporting by  Christian Plumb )
