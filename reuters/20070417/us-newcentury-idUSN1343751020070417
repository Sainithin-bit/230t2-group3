 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The government is seeking the appointment of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy trustee for New Century Financial Corp. ( NEWC.PK ) to replace its management and take control of the sale of assets, court papers show. 

 New Century also expects next week to disclose results of an internal probe by its audit committee into why it needed to restate results for the first three quarters of 2006, court papers show. That probe was announced one month before the Irvine, California-based company's April 2 bankruptcy filing. New Century had been the largest independent U.S. provider of home loans to people with poor credit histories before its collapse, which resulted in the firing of 3,200 employees. In a Tuesday filing with the U.S. bankruptcy court in Wilmington, Delaware, U.S. Trustee Kelly Beaudin Stapleton said management's failure "to ensure accurate financial accounting and to institute adequate internal controls constitutes cause mandating the appointment" of a trustee. U.S. bankruptcy law allows the appointment of a trustee "for cause including fraud, dishonesty, incompetence or gross mismanagement," before or after a bankruptcy case begins. Stapleton asked U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Kevin Carey alternatively to appoint an examiner for New Century. An examiner has fewer powers than a trustee but may investigate a debtor's alleged misconduct when it is in the creditors' interest or when the debtor owes more than $5 million. New Century spokeswoman Laura Oberhelman said: "The company strongly disagrees with the motion, because it is unnecessary and potentially disruptive to its efforts to maximize the value of its assets for the benefit of creditors and shareholders." Bonnie Glantz Fatell, who chairs the restructuring practice at Blank Rome LLP and represents New Century's official committee of unsecured creditors, said the committee plans to meet Wednesday to review the motion. "We are very concerned with maximizing asset values and recoveries," she said. "We hope to work out an accommodation with the U.S. Trustee's office to further that goal." FIDUCIARY BREACH? New Century's slide began after it said on February 7 that rising defaults would lead to a fourth-quarter loss and force a restatement of results for the three prior quarters. Stapleton said those disclosures and the possibility that New Century made little or no money in 2006, "clearly reflect that New Century's board of directors and executive officers failed properly to fulfill their fiduciary roles." Current Chief Executive Brad Morrice is one of the company's founders. In a footnote, Stapleton said the results of New Century's internal probe might bear on whether a trustee should be named. A hearing is set for May 15. New Century agreed to sell its loan servicing unit to hedge fund Carrington Capital Management LLC for $133 million and some loans to Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc's ( RBS.L ) Greenwich Capital Financial Products Inc. unit for $47.3 million, pending attempts to find higher bidders. It has yet to disclose a prospective buyer for its main lending business. The company has said federal prosecutors have begun a criminal probe of accounting errors and securities trading. At least 27 class action and other lawsuits have been filed against New Century, its officers and its directors. To view additional stories about the subprime lending crisis, click on nN16195443
