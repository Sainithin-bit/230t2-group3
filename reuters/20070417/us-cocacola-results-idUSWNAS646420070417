 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co. ( KO.N ) posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday, as the continued roll-out of Coke Zero helped boost sales in many countries. 

 Shares were up nearly 3 percent in afternoon trade, as the results proved to many investors that there is growth left in the soft drink business and that Coke is able to capture it. The Atlanta-based company said net income for the first quarter ended March 30 rose 14 percent to $1.26 billion, or 54 cents per share, from $1.11 billion, or 47 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items including a charge from an asset write-off in a Philippine bottler and gains on the sales of an equity interest in a Brazilian bottler, the company earned 56 cents per share. Analysts on average were expecting 53 cents per share on that basis, according to Reuters Estimates. The world's No. 1 beverage company saw strong gains in emerging markets such as Russia, China and Africa, as well as moderate gains in developed markets like Japan and the European Union, which offset an expected decline in North America. Coke, like rival PepsiCo Inc. ( PEP.N ), has suffered amid an industry-wide slowdown in the North American market as health-conscious consumers move away from soft drinks in favor of bottled waters, teas and energy drinks. While Coke Chief Executive E. Neville Isdell acknowledged that weakness on Tuesday, he delivered an optimistic message. "We continue to expect 2007 to be weak," said Isdell on a conference call with analysts. "But we do expect to begin seeing sequential improvement in the second half of the year as we execute against our key goals." Under the leadership of Isdell, who was brought out of retirement in 2004 to help turn the company around, Coke has introduced new products, smoothed relationships with bottlers, and launched a marketing campaign with the tagline "the Coke side of life." "We took away (from the earnings) the impression that the strategies Isdell has been working on appear to be paying off," said Eric Schoenstein, an analyst at Jensen Investment Management in Portland, Oregon, which owns over 1 million Coke shares among its $3 billion in assets. "It just looks like they're able to execute a little better than they had been previously," Schoenstein said. Stifel Nicolaus analyst Mark Swartzberg called Tuesday's results "the best evidence yet that a nearly 3-year turnaround is working and that the company's long-term targets are sound and being achieved." Swartzberg raised his earnings estimates and price target on Coke shares and reiterated his "buy" rating. BY THE NUMBERS Net operating revenue rose 17 percent to $6.10 billion as worldwide unit case volume, a key beverage industry metric, grew 6 percent, helped by strength in Latin America, China, Eastern Europe, South Africa, Nigeria and Russia. "Coke's growth has lagged over the past five years and is now coming back," said Marc Heilweil, president of Spectrum Advisory Services, which owns 132,522 Coke shares. He noted, however, that the company got a little boost this quarter as an earlier Easter holiday this year shifted some sales seen last year in the second quarter to the first. Case volume fell 3 percent in North America, but revenue in the area, which made up about 28 percent of the company's total, rose 2 percent, as Coke raised prices and sold a greater number of more-expensive energy and sports drinks. Volume rose 17 percent in Africa, 7 percent in Latin America, 11 percent in the European Union, and 5 percent in the Pacific region. The Eurasia region, which includes South Asia, the Middle East, Russia and the Balkans, saw its volume rise 16 percent. The results were driven by noncarbonated beverages such as Dasani bottled water, Powerade sports drink and Minute Maid juices, though soft drinks, which fell industry-wide in the U.S. for the past two years, rose 5 percent in the latest quarter, helped by the launch of Coca-Cola Zero, a no-calorie cola which tastes more like "the Real Thing" than Diet Coke. Coke shares have traded in their highest range since July 2004 in recent weeks. Before Tuesday, the stock traded at more than 19 times estimated 2007 earnings, making it the second-costliest stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average  .DJI  on a price-to-earnings basis, though its multiple is only slightly higher than that of rival PepsiCo. Coke shares were up $1.29, or 2.6 percent, to $51.56 on the New York Stock Exchange in late afternoon dealings.
