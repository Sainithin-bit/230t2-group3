 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - General Dynamics Corp. ( GD.N ) on 
Tuesday won a contract to build a new wireless network linking 
the Justice, Homeland Security and Treasury departments, a deal 
valued at around $5 billion by industry analysts. 

  The contract aims to create a secure communications network 
that would allow over 80,000 federal agents to transmit data 
and talk to each other throughout the United States and its 
territories.  General Dynamics. the No. 4 U.S. defense contractor beat 
out No. 1 contractor Lockheed Martin Corp. ( LMT.N ) for the 
highly coveted-contract. The two companies won a contract last 
June to demonstrate their proposals.  Defense contractors like General Dynamics and Lockheed have 
increasingly moved into information technology and other 
government service contracts in recent years, hedging their 
bets against an expected decline in weapons spending in coming 
years.  Vance Hitch, chief information officer for the Justice 
Department, said the Integrated Wireless Network was designed 
to be flexible and evolve along with changes in the wireless 
technology industry.  "Through the program, the IWN partner agencies are 
committed to achieving effective interoperability among federal 
law enforcement and homeland security agents, as well as 
between the federal agencies and the state and local agencies 
with which we partner," Hitch said.  After the September 11, 2001, hijacking attacks, many 
local, state and federal law enforcement agents were unable to 
communicate because they each relied on different networks and 
equipment.  General Dynamics spokesman Rob Doolittle gave no details of 
the contract, but said it would allow the various agencies 
covered by the deal to place task orders.
