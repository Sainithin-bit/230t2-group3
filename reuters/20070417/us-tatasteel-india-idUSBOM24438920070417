 MUMBAI  (Reuters) - India's Tata Steel Ltd. ( TISC.BO ) has approved plans to raise $4.1 billion, including a rights share issue, to partly fund its acquisition of Corus Group Plc, the company said on Tuesday. 

 Tata, which won a bidding battle in January to take over Corus, said the net cost of the purchase would be $12.9 billion. The acquisition, which catapulted Tata to the world's fifth-largest steel producer, is funded by equity of $4.1 billion and $6.14 billion in long-term debt from a consortium of banks. The remaining $2.66 billion has been raised in bridge finance, the company said. To make up its equity contribution, the company said it would raise 36.55 billion rupees ($872 million) through a rights share issue. One rights share will be offered at 300 rupees for every five shares held. It also plans to raise 43.5 billion rupees on rights basis through an offering of convertible preference shares, it said. "This increase in the equity capital will come into effect only in stages during the three financial years 2007/08 to 2009/10, which will therefore ease the burden of servicing," the company said in a statement. Tata Steel said part of its equity contribution for the Corus purchase came from internal funds of $700 million, foreign borrowings of $500 million and a preferential share issue of $640 million to parent Tata Sons Ltd. The company is also looking at a foreign issue of an equity-related instrument for up to $500 million, it said. Tata Steel had not finalized the exact form of the foreign offering, but issuing global depositary receipts could be one of the options, Koushik Chatterjee, vice-president of finance, told reporters. "Taking the whole financing plan, the overall $4.1 billion is being raised... at an effective post tax cost of only about 4.3 percent," N. Soonawala, vice-chairman of Tata Sons, said.
