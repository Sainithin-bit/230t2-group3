 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Mellon Financial Corp. MEL.N, one of the world's top asset managers, said on Tuesday that first-quarter profit jumped 22 percent after an acquisition helped increase assets to more than $1 trillion. 

 Pittsburgh-based Mellon, which will merge with former rival Bank of New York Co. ( BK.N ) this summer to form the world's biggest securities servicing company and one of the largest money managers, topped Wall Street estimates, and its share price climbed 1.8 percent. "We are extremely pleased with our first quarter results," Mellon Chief Financial Officer Michael Bryson told analysts on a conference call. Net income rose to $252 million, or 60 cents a share, including a $9 million aftertax gain from the sale of Mellon's insurance premium financing company, from $207 million, or 50 cents a share, a year ago. The most recent results also included $8 million in merger-related costs and a $12 million litigation reserve charge, totaling about 3 cents per share. Wall Street analysts expected earnings of 58 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Mellon's share price has climbed nearly 23 percent in the last year since the new chief executive, Robert Kelly, began making significant changes like selling off some units and keeping a closer eye on costs. On Tuesday, the stock rose 78 cents to $44.92 on the New York Stock Exchange. Income from continuing operations rose to $243 million, or 58 cents per share, from $193 million, or 47 cents a share. Revenue gained 13 percent to $1.41 billion from $1.24 billion. Gerard Cassidy, an analyst at RBC Capital, called Mellon's results "very strong" saying the company was helped by controlling expenses. Total noninterest expense rose 10 percent to $1.0 billion. Mellon, which competes with companies like State Street Corp. ( STT.N ) and Northern Trust Corp. ( NTRS.O ), passed a milestone when assets under management rose 28 percent to a record $1.03 trillion after it acquired European asset manager Walter Scott & Partners last year. Assets under custody or administration also hit a record, climbing 17 percent to $4.81 trillion. Fees collected for asset and wealth management climbed 31 percent to $609 million, while asset servicing fees rose 12 percent to $252 million. However, Goldman Sachs analysts worried that management fees were weaker than expected, pointing out that performance fees -- collected on hedge fund products -- were $35 million, compared with $58 million a year ago. Mellon's share price is currently trading about 17.30 times expected earnings, close to the sector average of 17.54 times future earnings but far less than other money managers like Eaton Vance Corp. ( EV.N ) and Janus Capital Group Inc. ( JNS.N ) Mellon's merger with Bank of New York is proceeding more quickly than managers initially expected, Mellon's Kelly told analysts, adding that shareholders at both companies will vote on the deal, estimated at $16.5 billion, on May 24.
