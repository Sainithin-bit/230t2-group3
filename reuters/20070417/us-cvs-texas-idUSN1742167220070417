 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott said on Tuesday that he filed a court action against CVS/Caremark Corp. ( CVS.N ), one of the largest U.S. drugstore chains, after finding customer records including personal information in a trash dumpster behind one of the chain's Texas stores. 

 According to the attorney general, CVS violated a 2005 law that requires businesses to protect customer records with sensitive information, including credit and debit card numbers. The office of the attorney general said it has the authority to seek penalties of up to $50,000 per violation. Abbott also charged CVS with violating chapter 35 of the Business and Commerce Code, which requires businesses to develop procedures for retaining and disposing of clients' personal information. The law provides for civil penalties of up to $500 for each abandoned record, he said in a statement.
