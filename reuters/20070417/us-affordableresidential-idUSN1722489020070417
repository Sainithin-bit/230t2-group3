 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Affordable Residential Communities Inc. ( ARC.N ) said on Tuesday it would leave the real estate business and sell its manufactured home community arm, which represents the bulk of its assets, to hedge fund Farallon Capital Management LLC for about $1.8 billion in cash and assumed debt. 

 The agreement sent Affordable shares down more than 6 percent, as dedicated real estate investors were forced to sell their stock, BMO Capital Markets Analyst Paul Adornato said. "I would say that there are clearly two different investor groups in the stock," Adornato said. "No. 1 are traditional real estate investors. Those investors can no longer justify owning the stock, since the company will no longer own and operate real estate." The second group are hedge funds who entered the stock during bad times a few years ago and were pleased when investor Gerald Ford assumed the chairmanship and took control of the company, which will now focus on its insurance operations. "Many of those investors, we believe, will likely stick with management," Adornato said. Affordable Residential said last week it was in talks to sell nearly all of its assets to Farallon. The home parks company, which traditionally made its money by collecting rent on lots at its home parks, said it would retain ownership of its recently acquired NLASCO insurance operations, and it would seek to make acquisitions with the proceeds from the manufactured home deal. The deal marks the latest real estate transaction for Farallon. The company has a stake in Accredited Home Lenders Holding Co. LEND.O, and recently joined with Simon Property Group ( SPG.N ) to buy mall owner Mills Corp. Affordable Residential owns 57,264 lots in parks in 23 states. The NLASCO insurance business, which includes the National Lloyds Insurance and American Summit Insurance companies, provides fire and homeowners insurance to owners of lower-end and manufactured homes, primarily in the southern United States. The transaction is expected to be completed by the end of 2007, subject to shareholder approval. Farallon agreed to offer positions to all of Affordable's manufactured home employees on substantially the same terms. Under the terms of the agreement, Affordable Residential said it would receive about $540 million to $545 million, after covering expenses, taxes, and retained debt and preferred stock. The gross proceeds total $1.8 billion, consisting of cash and assumed debt. Shares of Affordable Residential traded down 78 cents to $11.62 in afternoon activity on the New York Stock Exchange.
