 BOSTON  (Reuters) - EMC Corp. ( EMC.N ), the top maker of corporate data storage equipment, on Tuesday reported higher first-quarter profit, spurred by growth in software sales and its Asia business, sending its shares up 3 percent. 

 Net income rose to $312.6 million, or 15 cents per share, from $272.5 million, or 11 cents a share, a year earlier. EMC said earnings before one-times items were 14 cents a share. On that basis, analysts were expecting 13 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose to $2.98 billion from $2.55 billion, exceeding the analysts' average forecast of $2.94 billion. "Those are pretty solid results," said Morgan Keegan analyst Brian Freed. Software sales climbed 29 percent, while hardware revenue rose 6 percent. Sales in Asia increased nearly 30 percent, outpacing a 16 percent gain in North America. The Hopkinton, Massachusetts-based company's fastest growing unit was its VMware software division, whose programs help companies boost efficiency of corporate data centers, allowing them to save money on hardware, maintenance and other costs. Sales climbed 95 percent from a year earlier to $256 million. EMC said in February that it would sell a 10 percent stake in VMware in an initial public offering that analysts say could become one of the hottest of the year. EMC shares rose to $15.20 in premarket trade from a close of $14.76 on Monday on the New York Stock Exchange.
