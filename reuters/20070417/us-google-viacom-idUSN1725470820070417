 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Google Inc. ( GOOG.O ) is ready to introduce a copyright protection tool that helps media owners to automatically report acts of piracy on its YouTube video site, Chief Executive Eric Schmidt said on Tuesday. 

 Schmidt said the new tools, known as "Claim Your Content" could resolve accusations that the world's largest provider of Web search services is tolerating piracy by consumers to share video on its YouTube site. That complaint is featured in a high-profile lawsuit filed last month by media conglomerate Viacom Inc. VIA.N that seeks more than $1 billion in damages from Google for alleged violations of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). "As that product rolls out, the issue becomes moot," Schmidt said in response to questions from an interviewer's question about how the tool might affect the suit. "We are automating that process to claim that content."
