 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shareholders pressured Citigroup Inc.'s ( C.N ) board on Tuesday to allow major investors to call special shareholder meetings, in a move that could increase pressure on executives to improve the bank's performance. 

 Separately, shareholders failed to win the right to have a say in pay packages for senior Citi employees. At the annual meeting, investors passed a resolution calling on the board to change the banking group's bylaws to allow investors holding a minimum of somewhere around 10 to 25 percent of Citi's shares to call special meetings. If the bylaw change goes through, investors would have one more negotiating chip with management as the largest U.S. bank seeks to turn itself around, investors said. "I think it ups the pressure a little bit, but I don't see it as drastic," said Ralph Cole, a portfolio manager at Ferguson Wellman Capital Management in Portland, Oregon, which owns Citi shares. Citi, under pressure to cut costs and boost revenue, posted stronger-than-expected earnings on Monday. Shareholders at special meetings can put topics up for a vote, such as a proposal for a change in leadership or strategy. Citigroup's management recommended investors vote against the proposal, but the initiative passed with a preliminary tally of 59 percent of shares voting in favor of the proposal. The bank's board of directors must now consider the proposal but does not have to actually embrace it and change the company's bylaws. Giving investors the right to call special meetings is often seen as a sign of good corporate governance, because it can give shareholders more of a voice in running the company, said John Jarrett, director of research at GovernanceMetrics International in New York. Countries including Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom have corporate laws that allow shareholders to call special meetings, Jarrett added. EDS TOO Shareholders of Electronic Data Systems Corp. EDS.N passed a similar resolution on Tuesday, with those holding about 58 pct of the stock voting for the resolution, based on a preliminary vote count. GovernanceMetrics International sees Citi's governance as generally well above average, giving it a score of "9" out of a possible "10." Citi said in its proxy filing that it objected to the resolution because special meetings are expensive and time consuming. The proposal was put forth by William Steiner, an investor holding 1,660 shares. Another proposal seeking to give shareholders the right to vote to approve or deny pay packages for senior Citi officials gained 43 percent of the vote, on a preliminary basis. Investors were seeking an advisory vote on pay packages, rather than a binding vote.
