 LONDON  (Reuters) - U.S. futures pointed to a lower opening on Wall Street on Tuesday as markets pause for breath after a rally which took the Standard & Poor's 500 index to 6-1/2-year highs in the previous session. 

 Investors might also be cautious before key inflation data and a slew of earnings reports. Among the main companies to report this session are Coca-Cola ( KO.N ), Dow Jones & Co. DJ.N, Intel ( INTC.O ), Yahoo ( YHOO.O ) and Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ.N ). Financials will once again be a main focus with numbers due from Mellon Financial MEL.N, State Street ( STT.N ), Northern Trust ( NTRS.O ) and US Bancorp ( USB.N ), one day after the sector helped U.S. stocks to complete their recovery from a late February sell-off. U.S. index futures SPM7 DJM7 NDM7 were 0.2 to 0.3 percent lower as investors turned cautious before U.S. consumer prices, housing and industrial production data due later in the session. "I would say the market ran up a lot yesterday on the back of the Sallie Mae deal which ignited financials and I think probably (there is) a little bit of profit taking combined with a little bit of concern about the inflation numbers," said Jonathan Monk, senior portfolio manager at Aerion Fund Management. On Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  jumped 0.9 percent to 12,720.5 -- not far below its lifetime high of 12,795.9. The S&P 500 Index rallied 1.1 percent to 1,468.5. Student lender SLM Corp. SLM.N, better known as Sallie Mae, said on Monday it accepted a $25 billion takeover bid from two private-investment funds and two big U.S. banks -- JPMorgan Chase & Co. ( JPM.N ) and Bank of America Corp. ( BAC.N ). "Inflation has tended to surprise on the upside more recently. You'd have to be a bit worried about that, especially as the market is getting less sure that there is going to be a rate cut later this year," said Monk. Markets have scaled back expectations of the Federal Reserve cutting rates later this year on the back of recent data but Fed officials remain concerned about price pressures. Consumer price data at 1230 GMT will therefore hog the spotlight, whilst housing starts due at the same time will also attract attention after housing data reinforced worries the troubled sector was a drag on the economy.
