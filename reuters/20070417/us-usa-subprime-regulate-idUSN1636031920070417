 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The mortgage investments that helped fuel a recent U.S. housing boom now have many troubled borrowers trapped in loans that they cannot afford, a top bank regulator will tell Congress in a hearing on Tuesday. 

 While mortgage investments added liquidity to the market in recent years this also has put dangerous distance between the lender and borrower, Sheila Bair, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, is due to tell a Congressional hearing on the subprime mortgage crisis on Tuesday. "While this market-driven process has evolved in remarkable ways over the years, there continue to be challenges in terms of how this process operates in a time of credit distress," Bair will say, according to a copy of her testimony obtained by Reuters.
