 SHANGHAI  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp.'s ( GM.N ) commercial vehicle venture in China expects to increase sales by more than one-fifth this year and aims to maintain its number-one position in the Chinese market's minivan segment, a senior executive said on Tuesday. 

 GM is also in talks with SAIC Motor Corp., its China partner, about possibly manufacturing Wuling brand vehicles in Indonesia, Thomas Drumgoole, vice president of SAIC-GM-Wuling, told Reuters after a business briefing. The venture between GM, SAIC Motor, China's largest car maker, and Wuling Automotive manufactures minivans and mini-trucks, as well as the Chevrolet Spark minicar. GM, which competes with Volkswagen AG ( VOWG.DE ) and others in China, the world's second-largest auto market, said earlier this month that its overall China vehicle sales rose 25 percent during the first quarter. GM also has a passenger car venture with Shanghai Automotive Co. ( 600104.SS ).
