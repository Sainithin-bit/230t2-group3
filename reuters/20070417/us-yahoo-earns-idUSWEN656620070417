 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Internet media company Yahoo Inc. ( YHOO.O ) reported on Tuesday an 11 percent fall in quarterly profit, missing Wall Street estimates, as its new advertising system has yet to contribute significantly to earnings. 

 Shares of the company fell 5 percent in extended trading as investors also expressed concern Yahoo would not soon close the gap with Web search leader Google Inc. ( GOOG.O ). Stifel Nicolaus analyst Scott Devitt said it looked like the impact from Yahoo's new Web advertising system, dubbed Panama, was not showing up. "It looks like they lowered the second quarter (forecast) a little bit," he added. "We would be buying Google on these results. I think it's a market share issue, not a sector issue." Yahoo said net income for the first quarter fell to $142 million, or 10 cents per diluted share, compared with the year-earlier quarter of $160 million, or 11 cents per diluted share. Wall Street analysts, on average, were looking for a profit of 11 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 9 percent to $1.18 billion, excluding traffic acquisition costs -- the revenue cut Yahoo passes back to affiliated Web sites that run its advertising. The company previously cautioned that the first quarter would be the slowest-growing period of the current year. The consensus revenue prediction from Reuters Estimates, excluding traffic acquisition costs, was $1.21 billion, with forecasts ranging from $1.17 billion to $1.24 billion. Yahoo also forecast second-quarter revenue, excluding affiliate payments, of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. Analysts' forecasts fell within a range of $1.22 billion to $1.35 billion. Yahoo shares fell to $29.99 compared with its close of $32.09 before earnings were announced. (Additional reporting by  Michele Gershberg )
