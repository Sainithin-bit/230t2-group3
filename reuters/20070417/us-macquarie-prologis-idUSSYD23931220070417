 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - U.S.-based ProLogis ( PLD.N ), an owner and developer of warehouses and distribution centers, agreed on Tuesday to buy all of the units in its partner, Macquarie ProLogis Trust (MPT) MPR.AX, for A$1.43 per unit. 

 MPT, an Australian-listed industrial property trust, said in a statement the offer valued its total equity at A$1.24 billion ($1.03 billion). Shares in MPT rose 10.6 percent to A$1.41 at 0441 GMT. The offer price was 12 percent higher than MPT's last trading price of A$1.275. The two partners agreed the offer after a deal giving MPR exclusive access to ProLogis development pipeline in North America ended in 2005 as U.S. industrial property prices rose. "Once the exclusive access was no longer available to MPR, it became evident to the board, reinforced by investor feedback, that we needed to review the strategic direction of MPR," MPR independent director Trevor Gerber said in a statement. MPT has a portfolio of warehouse and distribution centers in the United States and Mexico.
