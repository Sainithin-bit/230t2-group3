 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Private equity firm Hellman & Friedman 
LLC, fresh from agreeing a lucrative sale to Google Inc. 
( GOOG.O ), announced on Tuesday the closing of an $8.4 billion 
fund. 

  The Hellman & Friedman Capital Partners VI L.P. (HFCP VI) 
is its sixth fund and it will make investments of $250 million 
to $1 billion, primarily in the United States and Europe.  Hellman & Friedman said it has now raised and managed about 
$16 billion of committed capital since its first partnership in 
1987.  The San Francisco-based firm invests in a number of 
industries including financial services, professional services, 
media and energy.  One investor with Hellman & Friedman is the biggest U.S. 
pension fund, California Public Employees' Retirement System 
(Calpers).  "We have enjoyed a long, mutually beneficial relationship 
with Hellman & Friedman and are delighted to be participants in 
their new fund," Sarah Corrs, a portfolio manager with Calpers, 
said in a statement. "We look forward to working with them in 
the future."  Brian Powers, chief executive of Hellman & Friedman, said 
the new fund's first investment is the pending acquisition of 
staffing services firm Kronos Inc. KRON.O.  Kronos agreed to be acquired last month for about $1.8 
billion. JMI Equity, another private equity firm, will 
participate in the Kronos deal with Hellman & Friedman.
  GLOBAL  Hellman & Friedman has made a number of high-profile 
investments, including a big stake in Nasdaq Stock Market Inc.  ( NDAQ.O ).  Catalina Marketing Corp. POS.N said on Tuesday it agreed 
to be acquired by Hellman & Friedman for about $1.7 billion 
including debt. Catalina concentrates on consumer behavior and 
direct marketing.  And last week, Hellman & Friedman had a big pay day when 
Google announced the acquisition DoubleClick Inc., a top online 
advertising network, for $3.1 billion. DoubleClick has been 
majority-owned by Hellman & Friedman since 2005.  "Over the past few years, we've become a more global 
organization, building a significant presence with our growing 
office in London," Powers said.  "Importantly, we have continued to differentiate Hellman & 
Friedman by partnering with managements of quality portfolio 
companies to provide not only capital, but relevant expertise 
that helps our portfolio companies build value," Powers said.  Private equity deals helped global mergers reach a record 
value of $4.06 trillion in 2006. Private equity firms were 
involved in about $737.4 billion of those deals, also an 
all-time high.
