 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Intel Corp. ( INTC.O ) posted a higher quarterly profit on Tuesday, boosted by a tax item and in line with analyst expectations despite the No. 1 microchip company's bruising price war with rival AMD ( AMD.N ). 

 Intel, which makes processors for about three-quarters of the world's computers, also gave a second-quarter revenue outlook that was below analyst expectations but said gross margin for the year would be higher than its initial forecasts. Intel said that first-quarter net profit was $1.6 billion, or 27 cents per share, compared to $1.36 billion, or 23 cents per share, a year earlier. It said the profit included a tax item that boosted earnings per share by about 5 cents. Revenue fell less than 1 percent to $8.85 billion. Intel was expected to have earned $1.28 billion, or 22 cents per share, on revenue of $8.96 billion, according to the average forecast of Wall Street analysts on Reuters Estimates. That estimate includes $50 million in restructuring costs but not the tax item that boosted earnings. "The first quarter got off to a pretty good start," Chief Financial Officer Andy Bryant told Reuters. "That was primarily because we had a little better luck on pricing and ASPs (average selling prices) were firmer." Intel has been locked in a price war with its smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc., which said last week that quarterly sales would be about 20 percent below expectations due to falling prices and lower unit shipments. Intel said second-quarter revenue would be between $8.2 billion and $8.8 billion, below the $8.86 billion that was the average forecast on Reuters Estimates. "We think second-quarter revenue will be down in line with historical patterns ... so we look at it as a pretty seasonal quarter that builds into a stronger second half," Bryant said. Intel said gross margin in the first quarter was 50.1 percent ahead of its target of 49 percent as lower unit costs and the sale of inventory more than offset the higher costs stemming from upgrading its manufacturing technology. Second-quarter margin would be about 48 percent, but Intel said it expected margins for the full year to be about 51 percent, ahead of the 50 percent it had previously estimated. Intel overhauled its entire line of processors last year in an effort to stop or reverse big market-share gains by AMD, whose chips were widely considered to be more powerful and energy efficient. Shares in Intel rose about 1.4 percent to $21.28 in extended trading after the results were announced. Over the past year, Intel's shares have risen 9 percent while AMD's have fallen 56 percent.
