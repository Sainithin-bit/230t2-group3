 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Time Warner Inc. ( TWX.N ) executives are weighing whether the company should reduce its cable-TV holdings amid competition from the Internet, the Wall Street Journal reported on its Web site on Tuesday. 

 A complete exit from cable TV is the least likely course, the Journal said, citing unnamed sources. The company is more likely to decide to gradually reduce its 84 percent stake in Time Warner Cable Inc., while still maintaining a significant interest, the paper said. Time Warner management will present several alternatives for Time Warner Cable to the board next month as part of an annual strategic review, the paper reported. The Journal also said that some executives were considering whether it should buy a major Internet company.
