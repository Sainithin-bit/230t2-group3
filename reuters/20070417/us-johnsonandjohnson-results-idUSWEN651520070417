 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ.N ) on Tuesday reported quarterly earnings well above forecasts on lower taxes and better-than-expected sales of its array of health-care products, lifting shares almost 3 percent. 

 Excluding special items, J&J said it earned $1.16 per share in the first quarter. Analysts on average expected $1.04 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. "Pharmaceuticals led the way," said Bank of America analyst Glenn Novarro, citing sizzling demand for epilepsy drug Topamax and the company's schizophrenia medicines. Based on improving trends, J&J said it is confident of delivering annual profit, excluding special items, of between  $4.02 and $4.07 per share -- eclipsing Wall Street forecasts of $3.90 per share. J&J shares were up $1.85 at $64.87 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Novarro said the surprisingly good first-quarter showing was due to a tax rate that fell more than two percentage points and sales gains across all three of J&J's product lines: prescription drugs, medical devices and consumer products. J&J said it earned $2.6 billion, or 88 cents per share, on a net basis, compared with $3.3 billion, or $1.10 per share, in the year-earlier period. The net results included a $807 million charge related to the recent acquisition of Conor Medsystems. Company sales rose 15.7 percent to $15 billion, about $500 million above Wall Street projections, helped by favorable foreign exchange factors and J&J's acquisition in December of Pfizer Inc's ( PFE.N ) line of consumer products. Global sales of prescription drugs, which carry profit margins far higher than the company's other product lines, jumped 10.6 percent to $6.2 billion. Sales of Topamax, increasingly also used to treat migraine headaches, jumped 30 percent to $610 million, while antibiotic Levaquin rose 18 percent to $475 million. Combined sales of anti-psychotic drugs, including schizophrenia treatment Risperdal and a recently launched altered form of the medicine called Invega, rose 16 percent to $1.18 billion. Medical device sales rose 6.2 percent to $5.3 billion, as higher sales of contact lenses, surgical and orthopedic products were partially offset by plunging sales of its Cypher stent -- used to prop open coronary arteries that have been cleared of plaque. Global sales of the drug-coated stent fell 27 percent to $530 million, amid concerns that it and rival devices can cause dangerous blood clots long after they are implanted. Company officials cited lower prices and "overall softness" in demand for Cypher. Sales of consumer products jumped 49 percent to $3.5 billion, as the brands acquired from Pfizer were absorbed by J&J and distributed around the world. (Additional reporting by  Lewis Krauskopf )
