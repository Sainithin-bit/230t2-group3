 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co. ( WFC.N ), the fifth-largest U.S. bank, on Tuesday said first-quarter profit rose 11 percent, as loan growth and higher net interest margin offset rising credit losses. 

 Net income for the San Francisco-based company rose to a record $2.24 billion, or 66 cents per share, from $2.02 billion, or 60 cents, a year earlier. Analysts on average forecast profit of 65 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 10 percent to $9.44 billion, topping forecasts for $9.31 billion, while operating expenses rose 9 percent to $5.53 billion. Average loans grew 3 percent from a year earlier. Wells Fargo, the No. 2 U.S. mortgage lender, has so far not been hit as hard as many rivals by the slowing housing market. Although it makes riskier "subprime" loans, it does not make some loans that have proved troublesome, and passes off the credit risks on some loans to investment banking partners. Fee income from mortgage banking rose 90 percent to $790 million, Wells Fargo said. Applications rose 19 percent to $113 billion, and new mortgages rose 3 percent to $68 billion. Net credit losses rose 65 percent to $715 million from a "historically low" $433 million a year earlier, but fell from the fourth quarter's $726 million. Chief Credit Officer Mike Loughlin said home equity losses are rising, and the bank expects "higher-but-manageable losses" throughout 2007 in that portfolio. Net interest margin, meanwhile, rose to 4.95 percent from 4.93 percent in the fourth quarter and 4.85 percent a year earlier. Wells Fargo shares closed Monday at $35.51 on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares are little changed this year, compared with a 2 percent decline in the Philadelphia KBW Bank Index .BKX. MARGIN Profit rose 27 percent to $1.53 billion from retail banking and 13 percent to $598 million from wholesale business banking. At Wells Fargo Financial, which lends to less creditworthy people, profit fell 59 percent to $114 million because of higher credit losses and a year-earlier gain from the sale of a Puerto Rico lending unit. Loans rose 6 percent to $325.5 billion, core deposits rose 13 percent to $296.5 billion, and assets fell 1 percent to $485.9 billion. Billionaire Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. ( BRKa.N ) ( BRKb.N ) has been Wells Fargo's largest investor, owning 7 percent of its shares as of December 31, according to Thomson ShareWatch.
