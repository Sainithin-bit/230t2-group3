 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Off-price retailer TJX Cos. Inc. ( TJX.N ) posted better-than-expected quarterly operating earnings on Tuesday on strength in all its units and predicted full-year earnings that could exceed Wall Street's expectations. 

 The owner of the T.J. Maxx and Marshalls chains also said it took a charge of $118 million, or 25 cents a share, related to a security breach of its computer system and forecast future non-cash charges of $21 million, ending months of uncertainty about the hacking's ultimate financial impact. "Together, these cash and non-cash charges represent our best estimate of all of the losses we expect to incur as a result of the intrusion," said Chief Executive Carol Meyrowitz on a conference call. The charge include 2 cents a share for costs incurred during the quarter and 23 cents a share for a reserve for TJX's exposure to potential losses, including those from pending litigation. Earlier this year TJX said information about 45.7 million credit and debit cards was stolen, along with personal information for 451,000 people, in a data security breach over an 18-month period. Groups representing 300 banks said in April they planned to file a class-action lawsuit against the company. Excluding the charge, TJX earned 38 cents a share in the second quarter ended July 28, topping analysts' average estimate of 36 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Net income was $59.0 million, or 13 cents a share, down 57 percent from $138.2 million, or 29 cents a share, a year earlier. Net sales rose to $4.31 billion from $3.96 billion, as consolidated same-store sales rose 5 percent. OPTIMISTIC OUTLOOK TJX, based in Framingham, Massachusetts, said it expects earnings from continuing operations of 53 to 55 cents a share for the fiscal third quarter, with sales at stores open at least a year up 3 percent to 4 percent. For fiscal 2008, which will end on January 26, TJX said it expects earnings of $1.84 to $1.88 per share, excluding $130 million in charges taken during the first half of the year. That outlook assumes same-store sales growth of 3 to 4 percent and fourth-quarter earnings of 57 to 59 cents per share. Analysts on average have been expecting earnings per share of 55 cents for the third quarter, 59 cents for the fourth quarter and $1.85 for the whole year. Meyrowitz said a number of factors boosted her confidence in the company's performance moving forward, including initiatives to cut costs while improving marketing and merchandising as well as TJX's history of consistent growth, even in weak economies. "We do well in a challenging environment," Meyrowitz said, noting that cash-strapped consumers often look for more bargains. "We are more recession-proof." TJX shares were up 24 cents or 0.9 percent at $27.90 on the New York Stock Exchange. (See  here  for "Shop Talk" -- Reuters' retail and consumer blog) (Reporting by Martinne Geller)
