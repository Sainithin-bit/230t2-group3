 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Global central banks are withdrawing much of the extra cash they have injected into banking systems to calm panicky credit since last Thursday. 

 Below is a list of central bank actions since the credit markets upheaval turned nasty last week. EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK Aug 9 - 94.8 billion euros ($129.8 billion) in a one-day tender on Thursday, the largest amount ever. Aug 10 - 61.05 billion euros ($83.61 billion) in a three-day tender on Friday to cover the weekend, Aug 13 - 47.67 billion euros ($65.29 billion) in one-day money on Monday Aug 14 - 7.7 billion in one-day money on Tuesday. The ECB also added an extra 73.5 billion euros in one-week money more than its estimated liquidity needs for banks during its main refinancing operation. Trichet also issued a statement on Tuesday calling for investors to stay composed composure in face of market volatility and a repricing of risk. The ECB's injections exceed those that it flooded into markets immediately after the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. At that time, 69.3 billion euro in overnight money was allocated on September 12, 2001, followed by 40.5 billion euros the next day. U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE Aug 9 - $24 billion during its regular market operations, only slightly above the usual allocation. Aug 10 - Added $38 billion through three separate repurchase agreements, its biggest single-day cash injection since September 19, 2001. The repos brought down the federal funds rate, the cost of overnight loans between banks, to the Fed's target rate of 5.25 percent. Aug 13 - Added $2 billion of temporary reserves to the banking system through overnight repurchasing agreements. Aug 14 - The Fed took the unusual step of refraining from an open market operation at 9:30 a.m. EDT, when daily operations are usually conducted. In an earlier statement, the Fed said it was evaluating whether or not to conduct an operation at that time and said it stood ready to conduct additional operations later in the day as needed. BANK OF JAPAN Aug 10 - Added 1.0 trillion yen ($8.45 billion) at its regular money market operation on Friday after a slight rise in the benchmark overnight call rate, the highest amount in about six weeks. Traders said the amount was at the higher end of market expectations, but was not a major surprise. Aug 13 - Added 600 billion yen ($5.1 billion) into the banking system in a one-week operation. Aug 14 - Drained 1.6 trillion yen ($13.6 billion) in two operations. BANK OF ENGLAND The Bank of England said banks hit by tough credit conditions could use its emergency lending facility, which is routinely available and priced at 100 basis points above the bank's 5.75 percent policy rate. BANK OF CANADA Aug 9 - Injected C$1.64 billion ($1.55 billion) on Thursday, saying it was in contact with other central banks on the global situation and stood ready to add money as needed. Aug 10 - Injected a total of C$1.685 billion ($1.605 billion) Aug 13 - Injected C$670 million. THE RESERVE BANK OF AUSTRALIA Aug 10 - The RBA added more than twice the usual amount of money into the banking system, injecting A$4.95 billion ($4.19 billion). Aug 14 - The RBA added A$2.6 billion ($2.2 billion) in its regular morning money market operation, slightly higher than average. SWISS NATIONAL BANK Aug 9/10 - The SNB offered banks money at a below-market rate of 2.6 percent on Thursday and Friday, adding a total of 3.1 billion Swiss francs ($2.57 billion). It since has started to drain the extra liquidity. Aug 13/14 - Traders said the SNB drained liquidity as overnight rates remained low after the previous week's liquidity-providing actions. CENTRAL BANKS OF MALAYSIA, INDONESIA, PHILIPPINES Traders said the Asian central banks intervened in foreign exchange markets on Friday to support their currencies by selling U.S. dollars. Malaysia's central bank chief Zeti Akhtar Aziz said on Monday there was sufficient liquidity in its financial system, but that it was monitoring the situation. BANK OF KOREA South Korea's central bank said on Friday it was ready to add funds to markets if needed. CENTRAL BANK OF NORWAY The central bank said Thursday's loan of 45 billion crowns ($7.80 billion) gave ample liquidity to banks and it would continue to ensure orderly operations in the money market.
