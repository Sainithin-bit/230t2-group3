 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A survey of U.S. consumers shows satisfaction with the products and services they buy improving just a little, but it also suggests their spending may remain weak. 

 The American Customer Satisfaction Index, the result of a quarterly survey by the University of Michigan's National Quality Research Center, rose 0.1 percent in the second quarter of 2007 from the first, to 75.3 on a 100-point scale. Findings for the second quarter were released on Tuesday. Compared with the second quarter of 2006, the index is up only 1 percent. "Customer satisfaction is pretty flat and consumer spending is slowing down," Claes Fornell, professor of business administration and founder of the index, said in a statement. Elaborating in a telephone interview, he said that while the overall reading of 75.3 is considered to be high, it is nevertheless clear that the rate of improvement is slowing. "The prediction is that consumer spending will weaken a bit," he said, "When customer satisfaction goes up, consumers are inclined to buy more, and when it goes down, the opposite happens." Customer satisfaction has improved for nine consecutive quarters. But the leveling off in the growth rate at the beginning of 2007 has coincided with a decline in consumer spending. Fornell said the latest survey also showed former leaders like Google, Apple and Toyota stumbling a bit. The industries that are in the survey change from one quarter to the next, but are the same as a year earlier. The latest survey includes automobiles, personal computers, appliances, portals and search engines, and news and information Web sites. Customer satisfaction with automobiles rose 1 percent to a high of 82, driven by greater satisfaction with domestic and European brands. The improvements more than offset declines by nearly all of the Asian manufacturers. Toyota Motor Corp.'s Lexus improved to 87 to lead the industry but Toyota fell 3 percent to 84 and Honda fell 2 percent to 84. Fornell said U.S. automakers are narrowing the gap with Asian companies but are still coming in last. With foreign brands passing domestic brands in sales for the first time last month, he said U.S. companies could have an opportunity if the foreign producers cannot maintain quality as production rises. Overall satisfaction with the personal computer industry fell 3 percent to 75. Apple and Dell each fell 5 percent, although Apple remained the top brand in customer satisfaction. Yahoo rose 4 percent to 79, taking the lead over Google for portals and search engines. Although Google fell by 4 percent from a year ago, it remained the most popular search engine. AOL had the biggest decline in customer satisfaction of any company in the second-quarter survey, down 10 percent. AOL's score of 67 was the lowest in both its industry and the overall second-quarter survey. Fornell said the survey results for specific brands correlate better with stock price and earnings than they do with sales. One reason for that is that sales can be influenced by special promotions such as discounts or rebates. Another reason is that some products are purchased less frequently than others, so there is a lag effect that varies according to industry. A total of 11,312 customers were surveyed in the second quarter. The margin of error was less than 0.1 percent for the overall survey, less than 1 percent for an industry and approximately 2 percent for a particular company.
