 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Two U.S. lawmakers have asked Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ.N ) for records related to a 2004 warning letter it received from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration concerning its Cypher stent as it probes the agency's handling of the matter. 

 U.S. Rep. John Dingell, chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, and U.S. Rep. Bart Stupak, chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, said they asked J&J for the documents as part of an investigation into the FDA's ability to protect the public from risks linked to the products it regulates, according to a August 13 letter to J&J Chairman William Weldon. Dingell and Stupak, both Michigan Democrats, also requested documents from the FDA as part of the probe of circumstances surrounding the April 2004 warning letter to Cordis. The FDA's 2004 warning cited the Cordis unit for violations in its manufacturing practices and quality systems used in the production of the Cypher drug-eluting stent. The letter, also dated August 13, said Cordis was allowed to continue to market the device, a tiny wire mesh device inserted into heart arteries to prop them open, despite numerous violations found during post-approval inspections of its facilities. The agency lifted the warning letter in June 2007 after Cordis addressed its concerns. A Cordis spokesman said the company will cooperate with the House committee's request. The Dingell probe is separate from an investigation into marketing practices involving off-label use of drugs and drug-eluting stents. Rep. Henry Waxman's Oversight and Government Reform Committee is conducting the probe into off-label treatments in which physicians prescribe products for ailments other than those approved by regulators. In March, Waxman sought documents from J&J, Boston Scientific Corp. ( BSX.N ), Eli Lilly and Co. ( LLY.N ), AstraZeneca Plc ( AZN.L ) ( AZN.N ) and Cephalon Inc. CEPH.O in that probe. Shares of J&J rose 27 cents to $61.72 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by Susan Kelly, additional reporting by Kim Dixon, editing by Gerald E. McCormick/Jeffrey Benkoe)
