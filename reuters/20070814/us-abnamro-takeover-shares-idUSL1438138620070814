 LONDON/AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - A Royal Bank of Scotland-led ( RBS.L ) consortium seeking to win a bid battle for ABN AMRO AAH.AS said on Tuesday it had built up a 3.25 percent stake in the Dutch bank and may buy more. 

 With ABN shares trading around 9 percent below the consortium's offer, the purchase will reduce the overall cost of buying ABN. The consortium -- which also includes Spain's Santander ( SAN.MC ) and Belgian-Dutch group Fortis FOR.BR -- said it bought 40.8 million ABN shares on Friday and Monday at an average price of 33.81 euros. RBS and Santander bought the shares as Fortis already owns an ABN stake of about 1 percent. RBS bought 26.2 million shares for 887 million euros ($1.22 billion) and Santander bought 14.6 million shares for 491 million euros, an SEC regulatory filing showed. The trio's combined stake is worth just over 2 billion euros ($2.7 billion). The banks said they may make further purchases of shares, within regulatory limits. By 7:00 a.m. EDT ABN shares were up 1.1 percent at 34.86 euros, outperforming a slightly lower European share market but still below the 38.2 euro per share value of the consortium's offer. The banks are likely to continue buying shares while that discount remains sizeable. Regulations could limit the consortium's stake to 5 percent, but that limit may apply to each bank and regulatory clarity was being sought, sources said. "They are obviously looking to marginally bring down the overall cost of the transaction, it's entirely sensible," said Alex Potter, analyst at Collins Stewart. The consortium is attempting to buy ABN for 71 billion euros, above a rival offer from British rival Barclays ( BARC.L ), currently worth about 63 billion euros or 34 euros per share. ABN shares fell sharply last week amid fears that recent market turmoil might cause financing problems for the consortium, force it to lower its offer or even walk away if the credit market turmoil worsens. The Barclays offer includes a larger proportion of equity. Either bid for ABN would be the biggest ever bank takeover. Barclays received regulatory approval to buy ABN from the Dutch Finance Ministry on Monday. The RBS-led consortium expects a decision from the ministry by mid-September.
