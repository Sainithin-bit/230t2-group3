 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Stock futures pointed to a firmer start on Wall Street on Tuesday, though credit concerns are likely to remain in focus while investors are set to eye earnings updates from retailers and producer prices data. 

 By 6:14 a.m. EDT, September S&P futures were 0.43 percent higher, Dow Jones futures were 0.3 percent higher and Nasdaq 100 futures NDU7 inched up 0.06 percent. "Any news that comes out about the credit situation or another fund being shut down, that's where the market is going to be very nervous, said Steve Previs of Jefferies International. Concerns about subprime mortgage exposure have haunted markets in recent days even as central banks have pumped fresh cash into the global financial system in an attempt to temper fears about a liquidity crisis. UBS ( UBSN.VX ), the world's largest wealth manager, beat forecasts with record second-quarter profits on Tuesday but warned that market turmoil may hit its investment banking business in the second half. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ), the world's largest retailer, on Tuesday reported higher quarterly profit than a year earlier, when it took a charge for selling its German stores. Earnings rose to $3.1 billion , or 76 cents per share, in the second quarter ended July 31, from $2.08, or 50 cents per share, a year earlier. Home Depot Inc. ( HD.N ) reported a lower quarterly profit on Tuesday as the softer U.S. housing market hurt sales. Earnings fell to $1.59 billion, or 81 cents a share, in the second quarter ended on July 29 from $1.86 billion, or 90 cents a share, a year earlier. Another U.S. retailer, TJX Co. Inc ( TJX.N ), is due to report quarterly earnings later in the day. "The retailers are going to be a big factor. People still don't have a handle on what the U.S. consumer is doing and what if any impact the subprime crisis has had on them," said Previs. Data on Monday from the Commerce Department showed retail sales rose more than expected in July as declining gasoline prices helped household budgets. Applied Materials Inc. ( AMAT.O ), the world's top maker of semiconductor manufacturing tools, as well as equipment makers Agilent Technologies Inc. ( A.N ) and Harman International Industries ( HAR.N ) are also among firms due to report results. On Tuesday's macroeconomic agenda, one of the main figures will be the producer price index, which is expected to have risen 0.2 percent in July, according to a Reuters poll. The latest figures on the U.S. trade deficit are also due. The rising price of imported oil is expected to contribute to the June international trade deficit falling deeper into the red, according to a Reuters poll of economists. Weekly chain stores and Redbook data are also scheduled for Tuesday. On Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  slipped 0.02 percent, to end at 13,236.53. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  dipped 0.05 percent to 1,452.92 and the Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  shed 0.10 percent, to close at 2,542.24.
