 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Hedge fund and private equity company Fortress Investment Corp. ( FIG.N ) posted a wider quarterly loss on Tuesday amid higher compensation costs, sending its shares down as much as 10 percent. 

 Fortress, the first U.S. private equity and hedge fund company to go public, reported a net loss of $55 million, or 66 cents per Class A share, for the second quarter, compared with a year-earlier loss of $42 million. At the same time, assets under management swelled to $43.3 billion, up 70 percent from a year earlier and up 20 percent from the end of the first quarter. Investors like pension funds and endowments continue to add hedge funds and private equity funds to their portfolios to help boost returns. The jump in assets helped boost Fortress' revenue to $283 million in the second quarter from $189 million a year earlier. The bulk of revenue was earned on its hedge fund products, where total revenue for liquid funds nearly quadrupled, to $151 million from $38 million. Revenue for Fortress' private equity business fell to $36 million from $96 million a year earlier. The New York-based company cautioned that its quarterly segment revenue will fluctuate dramatically depending on events in its private equity business. "Accordingly, the revenues and profits in any particular quarter should not be expected to be indicative of future results," it said. Fortress said profit-sharing compensation expenses weighed on earnings. The company recently hired former Morgan Stanley U.S. chief investment strategist Henry McVey. Fortress shares were down $1.13 to $19.44 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange after falling as low as $18.43 earlier in the session. Fortress went public in February at $18.50 a share. As an asset manager, Fortress is considered pricey, trading at about 16 times estimated 2008 earnings, while the average multiple for the sector is 15. (Reporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss)
