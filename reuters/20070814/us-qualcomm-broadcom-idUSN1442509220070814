 SANTA ANA, California  (Reuters) - Wireless chip rivals Broadcom Corp ( BRCM.O ) and Qualcomm Inc ( QCOM.O ) faced off in a California court on Tuesday to determine if Qualcomm should be allowed to license Broadcom technology while it appeals a jury's finding in May that it infringed Broadcom patents. 

 The latest proceeding in a bitter legal battle between the companies rivals followed a week of setbacks from Qualcomm, which said on Monday that its lead lawyer had quit. Investors in the companies are keeping a close eye on their courtroom battles as they view the legal spats as negotiating tactics that could lead to an eventual licensing pact, with the legal winner potentially having an advantage in any agreement. Broadcom was seeking an injunction in federal court on Tuesday to bar Qualcomm from supplying its customers with chips that a Santa Ana jury found in May had infringed three technology patents owned by Broadcom. The patents cover video compression for mobile phones, walkie-talkie style wireless technology, and simultaneous communication between different types of networks. Qualcomm has asked U.S. District Judge James Selna to force Broadcom to issue it a compulsory license to use the disputed patents. Qualcomm's attorney Evan Chesler said in court on Tuesday that the company has offered to pay Broadcom a "significant royalty" while it appeals the jury verdict. But Broadcom co-founder Henry Samueli, the first witness in the case, told the judge the grant of a compulsory license to Qualcomm could "dramatically" affect his company's leverage to negotiate a cross-license agreement that would allow it to use some of Qualcomm's patents. Last week, Judge Selna doubled the amount the jury had awarded against Qualcomm in May to $39.3 million and told Qualcomm to pay Broadcom attorneys' fees, citing Qualcomm's willful infringement of the patents. PHASE-OUT In court papers, Broadcom proposed allowing for an 18-month phase-out of the disputed chips to prevent disruption of mobile phone supplies. The phase-out would apply to devices running on a wireless technology known as EV-DO, which is used by the second and third biggest U.S. mobile phone services Verizon Wireless and Sprint Nextel Corp ( S.N ). Verizon Wireless is a venture of Verizon Communications ( VZ.N ) and Vodafone Group Plc ( VOD.L ). In another patent infringement case between Broadcom and Qualcomm, the U.S. International Trade Commission on June 7 banned the U.S. sale of some phones using Qualcomm chips found to infringe a Broadcom patent. Last week, the Bush administration said it would uphold the ban after a 60-day review of the decision. Also last week, in yet another patent case, a federal judge ruled that Qualcomm had waived its rights to enforce two patents asserted against Broadcom because it had concealed documents and patents. Qualcomm said it would appeal. Qualcomm is also involved in a bitter legal dispute with Finland's Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ), the world's biggest mobile phone maker, after they failed to reach an agreement before their technology license agreement expired early in April.
