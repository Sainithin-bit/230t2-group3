 MUMBAI  (Reuters) - Carmaker Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ), which is exploring the sale of its Jaguar and Land Rover brands, has contacted India's Tata Motors ( TAMO.BO ) and Mahindra & Mahindra ( MAHM.BO ) for management meetings, the Economic Times said on Tuesday. 

 Citing industry insiders, the newspaper said the meetings would be followed by detailed due diligence. Ford, the No. 2 U.S. auto maker, said last month it would continue talks with selected suitors for the marques. A source familiar with the matter said in July that Tata and its local rival Mahindra & Mahindra, as well as U.S. buyout firms TPG TPG.UL and Ripplewood, were among those that had expressed interest in a possible bid. A spokesman for Tata Motors said: "We do not wish to comment." Mahindra & Mahindra could not be immediately reached.
