 LONDON  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ), the world's largest retailer, underlined the recovery at its British grocer Asda on Tuesday, saying it had outperformed sales and profit targets in the second quarter of the financial year. 

 Asda's performance along with a strong showing in Brazil, Argentina and China provided a bright spot for Wal-Mart, which cut the group's full-year earnings forecast on Tuesday after reporting a lower-than-expected quarterly profit. Its shares fell to a 12-month low in opening trade. Price cuts and a simplified product mix helped Asda, Britain's largest supermarket group after Tesco Plc ( TSCO.L ), to increase its market share, Wal-Mart said. It saw its like-for-like sales increase in the mid-single digits in the three months to July 31. Its share of the grocery market stood at 11.7 percent in the 12 weeks to July 15. "The progress on customers numbers and market share gain has been steady over the past 18 months, and demonstrates the success of the Asda strategy," Charles Holley, Wal-Mart's finance chief for its international operations said in a recorded call. Chief Executive Lee Scott blamed the Wal-Mart group's disappointing performance on economic pressure on the 176 million customers who shop at its stores worldwide every week. Group sales rose 6.5 percent to $59.01 billion. Wal-Mart's Japanese retail business Seiyu Ltd. 8268.T said it expected to post its sixth consecutive annual loss due to slow sales. Wal-Mart, which now operates in 15 countries outside the United States having signed a deal to enter India last week, said its international sales rose 16 percent to $21.6 billion.
