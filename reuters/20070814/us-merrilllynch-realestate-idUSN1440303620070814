 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Investment bank Merrill Lynch MER.N is growing closer to relocating its headquarters to the Madison Square Garden area of midtown Manhattan from lower Manhattan, according to a published report. 

 Merrill has exchanged documents with Vornado Realty Trust ( VNO.N ) detailing a potential deal to be the anchor tenant at a new office tower it plans to build across from Madison Square Garden, the New York Sun newspaper said on Tuesday. Merrill, which is currently based in the World Financial Center, may relocate to a proposed 2.5 million-square-foot office tower at the site of the Hotel Pennsylvania, the paper said, citing a real estate professional close to the talks.
