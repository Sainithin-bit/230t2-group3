 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) will soon give household product makers a little more information about its shoppers in an expanded pact with Information Resources Inc., but the sales figures are still under wraps, the data provider said on Tuesday. 

 Information Resources already markets data culled from a panel of more than 100,000 households to manufacturers that sell consumer products to the world's largest retailer. That household panel data includes insights on when those shoppers buy items at Wal-Mart or another store, but until now it did not provide any information from Wal-Mart itself. Now, IRI will be able to show manufacturers how the data from thousands of households match up with the way Wal-Mart defines its consumer segments. IRI still will not get access to Wal-Mart's point-of-sale information, which the retailer stopped sharing with data providers a few years ago. In 2006, Wal-Mart said it had created 11 characters to develop strategies for boosting spending among its U.S. shoppers. The characters were designed to help Wal-Mart focus on the kinds of shoppers to whom it caters. Maria, for example, is a mother of three in her 30s who works part time and shops Wal-Mart only selectively, while Phil prefers brand names and doesn't chase fads. IRI said it planned to start offering the data later this year. At the same time, IRI will also provide marketing and merchandising analytics and auditing services for Wal-Mart under their multiyear agreement. Wal-Mart will get such information exclusively to get deeper insights on how displays of products and other efforts may be improving the shopping experience at its stores. IRI had already been doing some similar work for Wal-Mart to help the retailer understand shoppers' behaviors, motivations and needs when it came to health care items. Now, IRI will help Wal-Mart look at in-store displays for consumer packaged goods throughout its thousands of stores. A Wal-Mart spokeswoman was not immediately available to comment on the collaboration. The extension of the partnership came the same day that Wal-Mart reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit and cut its full-year earnings forecast, saying "economic pressures" like higher fuel prices have depleted shoppers' wallets.
