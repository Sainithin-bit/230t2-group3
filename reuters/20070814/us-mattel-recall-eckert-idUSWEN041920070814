 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Mattel Inc., the largest U.S. toy company, said Tuesday it may recall more products as it steps up its lead paint and quality control testing on thousands of toys. 

 "There could be additional recalls," said Mattel Chief Executive Bob Eckert on a call with reporters. "We are testing at a very high level here. No system is perfect. What's important is that parents understand what we're doing to fix those issues." Mattel recalled millions of Chinese-made toys on Tuesday due to hazards from small, powerful magnets and lead paint, its second recall in a month.
