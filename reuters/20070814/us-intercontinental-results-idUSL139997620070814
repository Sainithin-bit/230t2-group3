 LONDON  (Reuters) - The world's largest hotelier InterContinental Hotels Plc reported a 5 percent rise in first-half operating profit on Tuesday, near the bottom of analysts' forecasts, but said the outlook for 2007 was positive. 

 The British-based group, which operates InterContinental, Crowne Plaza and Holiday Inn hotels, said it continued to sign up new hotels and was confident it will exceed its 3-1/2 year target to open 50,000 to 60,000 net new rooms by end-2008. The company, which operates over 3,800 hotels globally, said the world market continues to be driven by the growth of low cost airlines, the Chinese market, Internet usage and by people living longer, and saw no slowdown in these market catalysts. "We are opening a hotel a day somewhere in the world, and are signing 2 hotels a day into our pipeline. Our outlook for the year is positive," said Chief Executive Andrew Cosslett in a conference call after half-year results. He added that a relatively low level of new hotels coming onto the world market is driving up room rates, while it had signed up 54,246 new rooms in the first half to give it a pipeline of 187,487 rooms to add to its 563,676 rooms worldwide. The hotelier, which earns over 70 percent of its profit in the U.S., posted first-half operating profit from continuing operations of 111 million pounds ($225 million), compared to forecasts ranging from 110 million to 119 million pounds and an average of 115 million pounds. It raised its half-year dividend 12 percent to 5.7 pence. The shares dipped 0.2 percent to 10.99 pounds by 4:20 a.m. EDT compared to a FTSE 100 index off 0.6 percent, in a continued slide since hitting a high of 14.48 pounds in mid-May. "There were few surprises with IHG's H1 results, with the underlying outcome close to our and market expectations," said house broker Merrill Lynch, while Citigroup said they were solid results in line with expectations and retained its "hold" rating on the shares. InterContinental shares have dipped 16 percent in the last month as tighter credit markets make a bid for the hotelier less likely. Takeover fever heated up as the Barclay Brothers built up a 10 percent stake by June, and Blackstone agreed a $20 billion deal to take over Hilton Hotels last month. "The market has interpreted that we are less likely to be taken out, but our focus is on the business," Cosslett said. Since April 2003, InterContinental has sold 178 hotels for 3 billion pounds, giving the cash back to shareholders, to become largely a manager or franchiser of hotels to mirror its three big U.S. rivals, Hilton, Starwood and Marriott. InterContinental now only owns 21 hotels worth around 1 billion pounds, with the majority of the value accounted for by its flagship hotels in London, Paris, New York and Hong Kong. Its shares trade on 22.4 times 2007 consensus earnings forecasts, just ahead of Marriott on 21.8, and Starwood on 20.2, according to Reuters Estimates. Hilton trades on 35.8 times after Blackstone bid a 32-times forward multiple. ($1=.4944 Pound)
