 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet called for investors to keep their cool on Tuesday after central banks worldwide slowly withdraw extra cash pumped in to avert financial panic. 

 Yet problems were far from over. Seventeen Canadian investment trusts have asked their banks for help to pay back loans that are due and U.S. investment banks Lehman Brothers LEH.N and Bear Stearns BSC.N were hit by concerns they were heavily exposed to problems in the U.S. mortgage market. Stock markets were very jittery and investors piled into the safety of government bonds on reports that the U.S.-mortgage problems, which have upended continental European credit markets, are now spreading to Canada. "We are still closer to the panic end of the spectrum," said Marco Annunziata, chief economist at UniCredit. "There's still a very high concern that we might be getting closer to a serious credit crunch and a serious financial crisis. This is keeping people almost paralyzed with fear." Trichet did his best to calm the situation. In an unusual statement, the ECB president said markets were nervous and volatility higher as investors build a larger risk premium into the price of securities. But money markets, the arteries of the financial system where banks lend money among themselves, were returning to normal following hefty injections of liquidity, he said. "I call on all parties concerned to continue to keep their composure. This attitude has been welcome and effective in the recent days," Trichet said. Bundesbank President Axel Weber also sought to soothe fears that credit problems in German banks could explode into a wider crisis. U.S.-mortgage derivative losses at an investment fund linked to a small German bank IKB had triggered much of the recent turmoil in Europe. Weber, who sits on the ECB's Governing Council, said checks with banks show that the dangers are limited. "We have confirmed our impression that the increased risks in certain market segments are insulated, and that the profit impact for credit institutions is limited overall." European analysts said these reassurances were important in providing more information to markets, starved of hard news leading to rumors and selling. European and U.S. shares retreated more than 1 percent on the day, following their biggest one-day rally in 15 months on Monday. Asia stock indices were flat to higher, with central banks in that region pulling back the extra money pumped into the banking system to steady nerves and keep markets trading . Analysts viewed the statements by Trichet and Weber as a sign they were significantly more worried than a week ago, but also an attempt to show that economic fundamentals had not changed, despite the severe upheaval in credit markets. Hence analysts saw the injection of ECB cash as temporary -- not necessarily a prelude to the ECB ending its round of interest rate increases. It has laid the groundwork to raise rates to 4.25 percent next month. "The fact they are going out of their way to calm markets makes it easier for them to go ahead with September," said Holger Schmieding, chief European economist at Bank of America. LIQUIDITY DRIP Central banks worldwide spent Tuesday reining in some of the liquidity they have pumped into money markets since last Thursday, when short-term borrowing costs spiked after traders worried about some banks' exposure to problems in the U.S. subprime mortgage market. The liquidity has been provided in the form of short-term loans to banks, which evaporates when the loans are repaid after a day or two. The U.S. Federal Reserve had not conducted any liquidity operations by 1600 GMT, over two hours after it usually does them. Asia's central banks were getting back to business as usual and although investors remained cautious, there was little sign there of the frantic selling of late last week. "The central banks acted quickly to keep the banking system ticking over and that's helped avoid a dramatic liquidity squeeze," said Peter Jolly, head of research at nabCapital. "But people are clearly still nervous, wondering where the next body is buried." The Bank of Japan drained 1.6 trillion yen ($13.6 billion) from the country's banking system in two operations, reversing two days of injections as surplus funds drove down the call rate. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) added A$2.6 billion ($2.2 billion) in its regular operation, a little more than average but modest against Friday's A$4.9 billion injection. The ECB gave an extra dose of 74 billion euros in cash that will sit in the banking system for one week, starting on Wednesday. And it added 7.7 billion euros overnight, to tide the banks over until Wednesday when the one-week refinancing begins. The overnight money amounts to a net 40 billion euros ($54.78 billion) withdrawal of funds, however.
