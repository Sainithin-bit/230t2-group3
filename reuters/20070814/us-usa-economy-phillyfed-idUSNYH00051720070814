 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Forecasters lowered their estimates for U.S. economic growth in the third quarter, while core inflation will remain steady in the fourth quarter from the third quarter, a survey issued by the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank showed on Tuesday. 

 The forecasters surveyed pegged third-quarter growth in U.S. real gross domestic product at an annual rate of 2.5 percent, down from a previous forecast of 2.6 percent. Core inflation, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy, was forecast for the third quarter at an annual rate of 1.9 percent in 2007, while fourth quarter core inflation was also seen at 1.9 percent. The respondents in the Philadelphia Fed's "Survey of Professional Forecasters" include economists at major financial institutions and research firms, universities and business groups.
