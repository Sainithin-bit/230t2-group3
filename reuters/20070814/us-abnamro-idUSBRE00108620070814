 LONDON/AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - A consortium of European banks seeking to win a bid battle for ABN AMRO AAH.AS against Britain's Barclays ( BARC.L ) said on Tuesday it had built up a 3.25 percent stake in the Dutch bank and may buy more. 

 With ABN shares trading around 9 percent below the Royal Bank of Scotland-ld ( RBS.L ) consortium's offer, the purchase will reduce the overall cost of buying ABN. The consortium -- which also includes Spain's Santander ( SAN.MC ) and Belgian-Dutch group Fortis FOR.BR -- said it bought 40.8 million ABN shares on Friday and Monday at an average price of 33.81 euros. RBS and Santander bought the shares as Fortis already owned shares, sources familiar with the matter said. The Fortis stake is likely to have been about 20 million ABN shares, or 1 percent. The trio's combined stake is worth about 2 billion euros ($2.74 billion). The banks said they may make further purchases of shares, within regulatory limits. By 3:50 a.m. EDT ABN shares were up 0.4 percent at 34.62 euros, outperforming a lower European share market but still below the 38.2 euro per share value of the consortium's offer. The banks are likely to continue buying shares while that discount remains sizeable, the sources said. The consortium is attempting to buy ABN for 71 billion euros, above a rival offer, currently worth about 63 billion euros or 34 euros a share, from Barclays. ABN shares fell sharply last week amid fears that recent market turmoil might cause financing problems for the consortium or force it to lower its offer. The Barclays offer includes a larger proportion of equity. Either bid for ABN would be the biggest ever bank takeover. Barclays received regulatory approval to buy ABN from the Dutch Finance Ministry on Monday. The RBS-led consortium expects a decision from the ministry by mid-September.
