 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. billionaire investor Carl Icahn reported on Tuesday that his fund has taken significant stakes in aluminum companies Alcan Inc. AL.TO and Alcoa Inc. ( AA.N ), which had previously held discussions to merge. 

 Icahn Management LP reported in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission its holdings as of June 30, which included a 3.52 million share stake in Alcoa and a 1.18 million share stake in Alcan. The fund also reported its stake in mobile phone maker Motorola Inc. MOT.N, which came to 69.11 million shares when combined with Icahn's individual holdings disclosed in a separate filing. Icahn said in May that he and affiliates owned more than 68 million Motorola shares, or a roughly 3 percent stake. Icahn had failed to win a seat on the board at Motorola in May after a bitter proxy battle with the company. Motorola, which posted its second quarterly loss in a row on July 19, has been losing market share to rivals amid criticism about its product line-up. Icahn Management also reported holding a 3.92 million share stake in Kraft Foods Inc. KFT.N, in which fellow billionaire investor Nelson Peltz has also taken a stake. Further, the fund reported owning 2.37 million shares of retailer Macy's Inc. ( M.N ), 3.78 million shares of packaging maker MeadWestvaco Corp. ( MWV.N ), and 7.94 million shares of business software maker BEA Systems Inc. BEAS.O, which were not reported in the previous quarter's holdings. The fund also reported taking a 1.47 million share stake in Clear Channel Communications Inc. ( CCU.N ), a 1.74 million share stake in Enzon Pharmaceuticals Inc. ( ENZN.O ) and a 3.24 million share stake in contract driller and equipment maker Rowan Cos. Inc. ( RDC.N ) The overall value of Icahn Management's holdings almost doubled from the previous quarter to $4.29 billion as of June 30.
