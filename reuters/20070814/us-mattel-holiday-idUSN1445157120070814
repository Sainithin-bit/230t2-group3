 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Mattel Inc. Chief Executive Robert Eckert said in an exclusive interview that it's "too early to tell" what effect the recall will have on holiday toy sales. 

 Mattel, the largest U.S. toy maker, recalled millions of Chinese-made toys on Tuesday due to hazards from small, powerful magnets and lead paint. The company's second recall this month involves 18.2 million magnetic toys globally, including 9.5 million in the United States. All of the toys have magnetic parts that can be dislodged.
