 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of Facebook ( FB.O ), the No. 1 social network, fell to an all-time low of $25.75 on Tuesday, well below the company's highly anticipated market debut at $38 on May 18. 
 Facebook shares lost 3.8 percent on Tuesday to $25.87, a 32 percent drop from the $38 a share IPO price. The eight-year-old company has shed more than $33 billion in value - several billion more than the market capitalization of Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ), the lead underwriter of Facebook's IPO. Here's a look at Facebook by the numbers: * Amount of personal wealth lost by founder Mark Zuckerberg, since May 18 IPO: About $6 billion * Average daily volume (including first day): 114.48 million shares daily * First day volume: 580.6 million shares * Percentage change from first-day share peak: 42.5 percent (as of Tuesday close) * Shares outstanding: 2.741 billion, which means: * Value at issue price of $38: $104.16 billion * Value at current $25.87 price: $70.91 billion * Market cap loss: $33.25 billion * Current market cap of Time Warner: $32.68 billion (Edited by David Gaffen and Kenneth Barry)
