 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Thomas H. Lee Partners has struck a deal to buy control of Party City in a deal that values North America's largest retailer of party goods at $2.69 billion, the private equity firm said on Tuesday. 
 The retailer's current private equity owners -- Advent International Corp, Berkshire Partners LLC and Weston Presidio -- as well as Party City management will retain minority stakes in the company, THL said. The sale comes more than a year after Party City's owners filed for an initial public offering. The IPO market has been facing challenges from weak global stock markets and Facebook Inc's ( FB.O ) troubled stock sale. Reuters reported last week that Boston-based THL was nearing a deal, worth $2.6 billion and $2.8 billion, to buy Party City after beating out two other private equity suitors -- BC Partners and a consortium of Leonard Green & Partners LP and TPG Capital Management TPG.UL. Party City sells party supplies, decorations and costumes, mainly under its namesake brand and the Halloween City, Factory Card & Party Outlet and Party Packagers names. "Party City leads the $10 billion retail party goods industry in terms of product selection and retail network," said THL Managing Director Todd M. Abbrecht. Bank of America Merrill Lynch ( BAC.N ) and Moelis & Company acted as financial advisors and Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP acted as legal advisor to THL. Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) and Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ) advised Party City. (Reporting By Soyoung Kim and Michael Erman; Editing by Gerald E. McCormick and Lisa Von Ahn)
