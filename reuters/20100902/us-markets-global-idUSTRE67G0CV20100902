 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Stocks and oil rose while U.S. Treasuries fell on Thursday as U.S. data showed the world's largest economy did not appear to be falling back into recession. 

 But investors were looking ahead to Friday's August U.S. employment report for clues on the recovery outlook. The euro rose against the dollar, supported by healthy results at Spanish and French bond auctions and stable global equities. The dollar slipped against other major currencies as the upbeat economic data boosted risk appetite. U.S. Treasury debt prices fell as strength on Wall Street undermined the safe-haven appeal of government debt. A string of grim economic figures last month ignited fears that the U.S. economy could slip back into recession. But Wednesday's rally capped concerns that some deem overblown. "Money seems to be flowing out of bonds and into the stock market," said Ryan Detrick, senior technical strategist at Schaeffer's Investment Research in Cincinnati. "Obviously, tomorrow comes the big news with the employment data. But in the near term, it shows how explosive rallies can be when we get decent economic data, because the market is pricing a double-dip recession." The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  added 50.63 points, or 0.49 percent, to 10,320.10. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  rose 9.81 points, or 0.91 percent, to 1,090.10. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  gained 23.17 points, or 1.06 percent, to close at 2,200.01. About 6.6 billion shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq and the American Stock Exchange, about average for the past month but still way below last year's daily average of 9.65 billion. Volume is typically light in the days just ahead of the Labor Day holiday weekend. The housing and labor markets have long been considered two of the biggest headwinds for the economic recovery. Friday's payrolls report is expected to show about 100,000 jobs were lost in August. World stocks .MIWD00000PUS hit a two-week high as optimism from strong U.S. and Chinese manufacturing data extended into a second day. The FTSEurofirst 300 index  .FTEU3  of top European shares ended flat as investors took a breather after the previous session's jump, while recently hit construction stocks extended their recovery, aided by the positive U.S. data. The benchmark index, which surged 2.9 percent on Wednesday following strong manufacturing data from the United States and China, is still down 2.1 percent from a peak in early August. Markets showed little reaction to Thursday's decision by the European Central Bank to keep interest rates on hold at a record low of 1 percent, as expected, amid tepid economic recovery and persistent concerns about the banking sector. For details, see: Comments from European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet had limited impact on the euro. The euro was up 0.09 percent at $1.2823 from a previous session close of $1.2811, supported by healthy results at Spanish and French bond auctions. France and Spain sold 12.2 billion euros of bonds, with the average yield on the 5-year Bono dropping at auction and the paper easily absorbed as the yield fell after the tender. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar was down 0.13 percent at 84.31 from a previous session close of 84.420. The focus now is on the U.S. Labor Department's widely watched monthly employment report, with analysts predicting non-farm payrolls fell for a third straight month in August. Currency markets are not paying too much attention "to anything but the jobs number tomorrow," said Greg Salvaggio, vice president of trading at Tempus Consulting in Washington. U.S. Treasury debt prices fell as investors took profits from a recent hefty bond rally and ahead of the jobs report. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was down 13/32, its yield at 2.6267 percent. The 2-year U.S. Treasury note was unchanged, its yield at 0.502 percent. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond was down 37/32, with the yield at 3.7124 percent. U.S. crude oil rose 1.56 percent to $75.06 a barrel supported by an oil platform fire in the Gulf of Mexico and Hurricane Earl's possible impact on East Coast refineries. Spot gold prices rose $6.95, or 0.56 percent, to $1250.80. (Additional reporting by  Rodrigo Campos ,  Vivianne Rodrigues  and  Ryan Vlastelica  in New York; Editing by Dan Grebler)
