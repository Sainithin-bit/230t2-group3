 BEIJING  (Reuters) - French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde, the leading candidate to head the International Monetary Fund (IMF), said the eurozone crisis will be the IMF's immediate focus, and she urged Greece to emulate Portugal in seeking to form a coalition government to push through painful reforms. 

 Lagarde made the remarks in Beijing, where she has been meeting Chinese financial and central bank officials to seek their support for her in the race for the IMF leadership. Portugal's prime minister in waiting, Pedro Passos Coelho, has begun formal coalition talks with the rightist CDS-PP party to seek a pact to form a majority government.
