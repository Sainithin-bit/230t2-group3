 BERLIN  (Reuters) - The German government is not involved in talks about a potential sale of carmaker Opel by its current owner General Motors, a German government source told Reuters on Thursday. 

 "This is a corporate matter, in which the German government is not involved," the source said. Two German magazines reported earlier that General Motors was considering putting Opel up for sale again with management losing confidence that the European arm will return to profitability.
