 BERLIN  (Reuters) - All three parties in Germany's ruling coalition back the government's position on Greece, Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said on Thursday after proposing private investors should renew their Greek bondholdings. 

 Schaeuble wrote to the European Central Bank, the International Monetary Fund and his euro zone partners earlier this week and proposed a swap in which private debt holders would trade in their Greek government bonds for new ones, giving Greece an extra seven years to work through its debt. ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet said earlier on Thursday that Greece must avoid any form of restructuring in tackling its debt crisis, in comments apparently underlining his opposition to such pressure. "I am not embarking on a dialogue with a particular minister here," Trichet said at the bank's monthly news conference in Frankfurt, emphasizing: "We are not in favor of restructuring ... and so forth. We exclude all concepts which would not be purely ... without any elements of compulsion." But Schaeuble said after a meeting of the budget committee that there was strong support for his idea from Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative Christian Democrats (CDU), their Bavarian sister party Christian Social Union (CSU) and the Free Democrats (FDP). "As I'm sure you've probably heard, there was an overwhelming agreement in both parliamentary groups (conservatives and Free Democrats) to the broad lines of the government," Schaeuble said. He added: "What's at stake is that additional measures are necessary so that Greece can be spared the necessity of going to the financial markets for financing through 2014." Schaeuble said that not only additional means are needed but also further efforts by Greece. "We are ready, in principle, to make our contribution. But if Greece needs additional time, that cannot mean that the private sector escapes from its responsibility," he said, adding it was important to prevent that from happening. He said it would not be easy to reach an agreement with private creditors but added an agreement is possible and will be reached. "I believe it's no longer a question of 'if' but rather a question of 'how'," he said, referring to the participation of private creditors in Greek aid.
