 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - An involuntary debt restructuring in Greece is 'undesirable' and the IMF-EU program does not contemplate such a step, an IMF spokeswoman said on Thursday amid talks of a new aid package for Greece. 

 "Everybody agrees that any involuntary debt restructuring or credit event would be undesirable," IMF spokeswoman Caroline Atkinson told a news briefing. "What is important is that there should be a sufficient amount of financing on appropriate terms," to fill an expected financing gap, she added.
