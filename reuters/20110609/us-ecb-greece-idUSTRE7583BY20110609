 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Greece must avoid any form of restructuring in tackling its debt crisis, ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet said on Thursday. 

 "We are not in favor of restructuring ... and so forth. We exclude all concepts which would not be purely ... without any elements of compulsion," Trichet told a news conference. "We call for avoiding any credit event and selective default, say. And of course, default." Trichet was questioned repeatedly on the Greek crisis during a news conference to discuss the ECB's decision on Thursday to keep interest rates at 1.25 percent. He also signaled the ECB stood ready to raise rates again next month, despite the crisis engulfing the euro zone's weaker economies. The ECB is caught up in high-stakes maneuvering between financial markets, euro zone governments and the International Monetary Fund over who pays to avoid Greece becoming the euro zone's first state insolvency. Greek government bond yields rose sharply on Wednesday after German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble called for a "substantial contribution" to support Greece from private holders of its debt and suggested extending the maturities of outstanding Greek debt by seven years. Trichet's comments on Thursday appear to underline his opposition to such pressure. "I am not embarking on a dialogue with a particular minister here," Trichet said, later reiterating: "No credit event, no selective default." One idea mooted by EU officials is to get banks to agree voluntarily to buy new Greek debt when the bonds they currently hold mature. Asked if the ECB would roll over its own Greek bondholdings, Trichet replied: "It's certainly not our intention." He also indicated the ECB might not be willing to accept Greek bonds as collateral from banks seeking loans if some form of restructuring made the bonds ineligible under ECB rules. "We have a strong determination to apply our framework and our rules, whatever happens here and there. And we have very clear position in this respect," Trichet said.
