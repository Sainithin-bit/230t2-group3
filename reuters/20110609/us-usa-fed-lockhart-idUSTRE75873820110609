 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - The U.S. economy looks increasingly weaker but there is little the Federal Reserve can do to boost employment further, Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Dennis Lockhart said on Thursday. 

 Speaking at his office in Atlanta, Lockhart said he had recently revised down his forecasts for economic growth this year given a disappointing performance during the first half. However, he said conditions were quite different now than when the Fed launched its second round of bond purchases, the program of quantitative easing designed to stimulate the economy known as QE2. In particular, Lockhart noted that the risk of a damaging spiral of falling prices and wages, which underpinned the Fed's decision to buy an additional $600 billion in Treasury bonds back in November, had largely vanished. "I don't think QE3 will be necessary," Lockhart told Reuters in an interview. "I think we're going to see this modest, moderate but continuing pace of growth that doesn't require further stimulus. Still, Lockhart admitted being less confident in his forecast for improved performance in the second half compared with a few months ago. Part of the impediment to further easing steps comes from the Fed's own success in engineering a rise in inflation that officials say helped prevent a descent into deflation. "We don't have anything remotely like a deflationary risk at the moment, short of a shock of some kind," Lockhart said. In that context, the bar for another round of monetary easing is very high, said Lockhart, saying it would take "a significant deterioration as reflected in the overall economy, a set of deflationary signals and also unemployment numbers that rise dramatically." Still, while the Fed may not be inclined to do more, it could keep borrowing costs at very low levels for a long period of time, Lockhart said. "I could see the case for a pause that keeps a fairly static level of fairly accommodative policy to support a continuing recovery, obviously in the absence of inflation developments. I can see that for some period of time," he said. ROUGH PATCH Though U.S. economy expanded at a subdued 1.8 percent annualized clip in the first quarter, it was expected to pick up in the second quarter. Instead, the weakness has lingered. The latest sign of trouble came from the May employment data released last week. It showed the economy generating just 54,000 jobs last month, and the jobless rate rose again, hitting 9.1 percent. "It's a little early to interpret one month's numbers, so I'm reluctant to say a new trend has developed that is a lower trend on employment," said Lockhart, who is not a voter this year on the Fed's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee. "But certainly it's a disappointing number." Part of the hope for better economic growth in the second half, he said, comes from a sense that many of the current factors creating a drag on growth will fade. In particular, he said the ripple effects of Japan's earthquake and tsunami had a "discernible" impact on U.S. growth, adding that gasoline prices should level off, easing some of the sticker shock to U.S. consumers. Asked about the ongoing budget debate in Congress, Lockhart said it was important to separate the immediate issue of the debt ceiling from the need for a credible long-term fiscal plan to get the budget under control. "It's a very serious policy matter. What is important at the moment is to raise the debt ceiling and develop that (long-term) plan," he said. With regards to Europe, where lingering problems over high sovereign debt levels continue to fester, Lockhart said while the U.S. financial system has little direct exposure to the debt of troubled nations like Greece, it too has an interest in a swift resolution of the problem. A potential default could prove particularly problematic. "Certainly if that were to happen it could contribute to a continued slowdown in Europe which would not be good for the global economy and would not be good for the United States," Lockhart said.
