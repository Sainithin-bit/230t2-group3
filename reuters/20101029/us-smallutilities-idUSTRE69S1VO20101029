 BANGALORE  (Reuters) - U.S. power companies Alliant Energy ( LNT.N ), DPL Inc DPL.N and Calpine ( CPN.N ) followed their larger peers in posting strong profits and indicating a solid finish to the year, as they too reaped the benefits of a hot summer and an improving economy. 

 While a colder winter drove first-quarter earnings of power companies, the warmer-than-normal summer propped the second and third quarters. Out of the about 20 utilities that reported results so far -- including Duke Energy ( DUK.N ), Xcel Energy ( XEL.N ), Southern Co ( SO.N ) and CenterPoint Energy ( CNP.N ) -- almost all have either raised or backed their full-year profit outlook, giving the recovery in the U.S. economy a stamp of approval. According to the Energy Information Administration, July and August heat, especially across the Midwest and Northeast, may push second-half power use in the United States up by 5.2 percent -- a potential wake-up call for the utilities that delayed plans to add new nuclear and coal-fired plants during the recession. The power utility sector sub-index .GSPELEC is up around 15 percent since late-May, just outpacing the broader Dow Jones Industrial Average  .DJI . DEMAND HOTS UP Madison, Wisconsin-based Alliant's adjusted third-quarter profit rose 70 percent, comfortably beating estimates. Revenue was up 7 percent, and the company raised its full-year profit outlook. "Cooling degree days in the service territories of Interstate Power and Light and Wisconsin Power and Light were above normal for the third quarter," Alliant said. Degree days, a measure of departure in the mean daily temperature from 65 degrees Fahrenheit (18 Celsius), are used to reflect demand for energy to heat or cool homes and businesses. Alliant said favorable weather conditions pushed electric margins up by about 11 cents a share in the quarter. Dayton, Ohio-based DPL's profit came in line and revenue rose 27 percent, helping the company back its full-year profit view. "We had a solid quarter driven by sustained hot weather and improved economic conditions, and we remain on track to achieve our 2010 earnings estimates," DPL Chief Executive Paul Barbas said in a statement. Houston-based Calpine had its first profit in four quarters. Larger peer Ameren Corp ( AEE.N ) also reported strong results and raised 2010 view. Factors favorably affecting third-quarter results included higher electricity sales and new utility rates, Ameren said. Favorable temperatures in Texas and New Mexico boosted PNM Resources ( PNM.N ), which is among the smallest U.S. utilities. Despite its profits beating estimates and the company raising its outlook for the year, PNM remained reserved. "We also saw some improvement in weather-normalized load growth in New Mexico; however, we continue to remain cautious about the economy," PNM said. Allete ( ALE.N ), valued at about $1.3 billion, was more bullish though, as its profit breezed past estimates on higher industrial sales. "We are particularly pleased that economic improvement was seen by customers in our service territory compared to what was experienced a year ago," Allete Chief Executive Alan Hodnik said. Profit at Edison International ( EIX.N ) beat estimates, while DTE Energy ( DTE.N ) profit was in line with market estimates. Earnings at Dominion Resource ( D.N ) and Constellation Energy Group CEG.N lagged. (Reporting by Adveith Nair and Krishna N Das; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier)
