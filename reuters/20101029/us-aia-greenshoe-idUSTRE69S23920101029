 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - AIA Group Ltd ( 1299.HK ) said the over-allotment option, representing 15 percent of the total number of its initial public offering shares, was exercised in full on Friday, after a strong trading debut in Hong Kong. 

 The stock surged 17 percent to close at HK$23.05 as investors, chasing exposure to Asia's fast-growing life insurance business, piled into the record offering in the world's hottest IPO market. (Reporting by Alison Leung; Editing by  David Holmes )
