 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc ( CAT.N ), a U.S. heavy equipment maker that has been moving aggressively into the rail business, will announce plans on Friday to open a railcar facility in Indiana, the (Muncie) Star Press newspaper reported on Friday. 

 Citing unnamed sources, the paper said Caterpillar's Progress Rail unit would take over a huge vacant factory in Muncie that has doors in the rear that allow trains to enter and exit. The report did not say whether the plant would be used to service locomotives and other railroad rolling stock or to manufacture new equipment. It said the facility, in east-central Indiana, would eventually employ 650 workers. A spokesman for Peoria, Illinois-based Caterpillar, best known for its yellow construction and mining equipment, declined to comment on the report. Until recently, Progress Rail was focused strictly on repairing and remanufacturing rail equipment made by other manufacturers, including General Electric Co ( GE.N ). But that changed this summer when Caterpillar purchased Electro-Motive Diesel, a locomotive manufacturer spun out of General Motors, for $820 million from the private equity firms Berkshire Partners LLC and Greenbriar Equity Group LLC. EMD's headquarters, engineering facilities and parts-manufacturing operations are located in LaGrange, Illinois, just west of Chicago. But final assembly of the passenger, freight and road-switching locomotives EMD makes is performed at a plant in London, Ontario, Canada. Assembly in Canada has effectively stopped EMD from selling its locomotives to the many regional commuter rail lines in the United States, because the lines often require that the equipment they buy be assembled in the United States. Over the past four years, Caterpillar, which is also a big maker of diesel engines and gas turbines, has spent about $2 billion in the rail sector. It was an industry that was viewed as important but dull until last year, when Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc ( BRKa.N ) ( BRKb.N ) bought Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp for $26 billion. It was Buffett's biggest acquisition in the 44 years he has run Berkshire and one he characterized as "an all-in wager on the economic future of the United States." Locomotives have been an underperforming business for GE lately. Profit at the unit was down 62 percent to $242 million for the first nine months of the year, while revenue fell 27 percent to $2.34 billion. (Reporting by  James B.
