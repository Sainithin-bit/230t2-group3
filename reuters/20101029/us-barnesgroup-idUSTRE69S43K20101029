 (Reuters) - Diversified manufacturer Barnes Group Inc ( B.N ) said it expects a change in the schedule of Boeing Co's ( BA.N ) 787 Dreamliner and 747-8 programs to impact its fourth quarter and the first half of 2011. 

 Barnes, which began life as a metal parts shop in 1857, supplies aerospace components to General Electric Co ( GE.N ), an engine supplier for Boeing. Boeing said in August its 787 program, nearly 3 years behind its original schedule, would be delayed to the middle of the first quarter of 2011. Last month, it said it would delay first delivery of the 747-8 Freighter, its biggest commercial jet, for the third time. The delays have affected the schedule of more than 50 engine sets, Barnes Chief Executive Gregory Milzcik said on a conference call with analysts. The maker of aerospace and industrial components said its aerospace original equipment maker (OEM) sales were roughly flat for the third quarter, but order intake rose 51 percent, pushing the OEM backlog to $362 million. Barnes, which also operates a logistics segment, narrowed its 2010 earnings outlook to $0.95-$1.00 a share, from a prior view of $0.90-$1.10, on 8-10 percent revenue growth. The company said its cautious outlook took into account the possibility of a slowdown in economic recovery and increased pricing pressure. "We continue to believe customers are actively managing costs and maintaining minimum levels of inventory," Milzcik said. "And we would expect these customers to be especially cautious as we close out 2010." NARROW Q3 MISS July-September earnings rose to $15.1 million, or 27 cents a share, just missing analysts expectations of 28 cents. The company, whose peers include aerospace component makers Precision Castparts Corp ( PCP.N ), HEICO Corp ( HEI.N ) and Esterline Technologies Corp ( ESL.N ), posted an 18 percent jump in precision components unit sales to $154 million, helped by strong order rates and demand in North America and Europe. Shares of the Bristol, Connecticut-based company were trading down 2 percent at $17.99 Friday morning on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has gained 23 percent since touching a year-low of $14.97 on August 24. (Reporting by  Soham Chatterjee  in Bangalore; Editing by Jarshad Kakkrakandy)
