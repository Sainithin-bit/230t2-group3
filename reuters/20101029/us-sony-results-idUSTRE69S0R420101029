 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's Sony Corp ( 6758.T ) swung back to a second-quarter profit on improved PC and game businesses, and raised its outlook despite tough price competition and a strong yen. 

 Sony, which competes with Samsung Electronics ( 005930.KS ) and LG Electronics ( 066570.KS ) in televisions, and Nintendo 7974.OS and Microsoft ( MSFT.O ) in games, reported a 68.65 billion yen ($847 million) operating profit for July-September, helped also by cost cuts. The quarterly profit compares with a 32.6 billion yen loss during the same period last year and an estimate for a 35.1 billion yen profit in a poll of five analysts by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. For the full year to March, Sony raised its profit forecast to 200 billion yen from 180 billion yen. The forecast is above an average estimate for a 187.4 billion yen profit from 23 analysts. Continued restructuring helped prop up Sony's TV business, while strong sales of digital SLR cameras, in which it vies with Japan's Canon Inc ( 7751.T ), also supported Sony's earnings. In games, Sony launched its Move motion-based video game controller last month to be used with its PlayStation 3 console, and it has shipped 1 million units of the new product in its first month on the market in the Americas region.
