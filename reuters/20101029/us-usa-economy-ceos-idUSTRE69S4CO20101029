 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - U.S. corporate leaders are breathing a little easier these days, no longer haunted by the specter of a double-dip recession in the world's largest economy. 

 But as they deliver preliminary assessments of the coming year, the picture they paint of the U.S. economy's prospects provides scant comfort to the 14.8 million U.S. workers who are officially unemployed -- and the millions more who are either underemployed or too discouraged to look for work. That's because the consensus in U.S. boardrooms -- based on what executives have said this earnings season -- is that the U.S. economy will continue to grow in 2011, but not fast enough to create a significant number of jobs. "We see no signs of any broad-scale, broad-based double dip," 3M Co ( MMM.N ) Chief Executive Officer George Buckley told analysts on Thursday. But Buckley echoed the comments of many other CEOS when he called the near-term prospects for the U.S. economy "uninspiring" and predicted "an extended period of slow recovery" in the market. That means 2011 will be a lot like 2010 -- in movie terms, more "Groundhog Day" than "Armageddon" -- as lackluster job growth keeps weighing on consumer spending, which accounts for 70 percent of U.S. economic activity. Indeed, the U.S. economy is likely to grow just 2.4 percent next year, according to a Reuters survey of more than 80 U.S. economists conducted in October. That's a hair below this year's estimated growth rate and at least a percentage point slower than the global economy as a whole. 'A LONG SLOG' "I don't believe the U.S. is in a fast-recovery mode," said Doug Baker, CEO of cleaning services company Ecolab ( ECL.N ), which generates about half its $6 billion in annual sales in the United States. "It's recovering but it's going to be several years before we all recognize it as a good economic environment," Baker said, adding that the process would be a "long slog." Legg Mason Inc ( LM.N ) CEO Mark Fetting agreed. The Baltimore-based asset manager supports the U.S. Federal Reserve's resumption of purchases of debt, including U.S. Treasuries, to stimulate the economy by making borrowing cheaper, Fettig said. Not all U.S. corporate leaders agree with the policy. When the Business Council, an influential policy group whose 150 members run America's biggest companies, surveyed those CEOs this month, 70 percent opposed a second round of fiscal stimulus to jump-start economic growth. "Our view is just kind of 'get out of our way and let us do what we do,'" Rockwell Collins ( COL.N ) CEO Clay Jones told Reuters this week. "We're almost being helped to death." More than half opposed any more quantitative easing by the Fed to stimulate the economy by purchasing assets and pouring money into the system. "Companies are awash in cash so there's plenty of liquidity," Southwest Airlines Co ( LUV.N ) CEO Gary Kelly told Reuters this week. "We don't need more money." The Business Council survey found executives pessimistic about the prospects for the U.S. economy next year. Only a third of the CEOs said they believed their own industries would improve over the next six months -- down from two-thirds back in May, when the group last polled them. (For a graphic on the survey click on  r.reuters.com/ruj92q  ) The group said its survey did not indicate the U.S. economy was headed back into a recession, but its members did believe 2011 would be similar to 2010 in terms of economic growth and that unemployment would stay around 9.1 percent through at least June. "The momentum in the U.S. and global economy evident in recent surveys has subsided," JPMorgan Chase ( JPM.N ) CEO and Business Council Vice Chairman Jamie Dimon wrote in an introduction to the survey. Of course, financial results to date have been pretty good, providing an encouraging counterpoint to the gloom-and-doom camp. European companies are matching and beating profit expectations at a rate unseen since 2006. Meanwhile, results from nearly four-fifths of the top U.S. companies that have reported so far have topped estimates, matching the record set a year ago. But expectations are what matter, and those are depressed. When the Business Council asked its members about prospects for corporate profits, they said they expected them to slow in 2011 as the overseas growth that helped offset lingering weakness in Europe and North America moderates. "The consensus shows that economic, financial and environmental conditions are more risky and less predictable than ever before," Dimon wrote. "An overwhelming majority believes the potential of devastating economic loss or reputational damage is at an all-time high." LOOKING OVERSEAS Caterpillar Inc ( CAT.N ) and other U.S. companies that generate a big chunk of their sales overseas are likely to keep relying on growth there, given the weak rebound at home. Caterpillar, the world's largest maker of earth-moving equipment, expects its sales next year to rebound to pre-recession levels as the world economy grows by more than 3.5 percent. Developing nations will be driving that growth. Caterpillar sees China's economy growing 9.5 percent next year, India's 8.5 and Indonesia's 6 percent. The United States? Just 3 percent growth, Caterpillar forecasts. While that's actually on the high end, as far as predictions go, the Peoria, Illinois-based company acknowledges it won't be enough to generate significant job growth. For companies like Procter & Gamble Co ( PG.N ), the world's largest household products maker, that's likely to mean another year of headwinds. Yet CEO Bob McDonald is philosophical. "The way I look at an economic recovery from a recession is that it's always uneven," he said. "You have a couple of months where things look good; you have a month where things drop backwards. My expectation is the global economy will continue to improve, that we will continue to see the kind of growth we have seen in developing markets." (Reporting by James B.
