 SAN FRANCISCO/PARIS  (Reuters) - Second-tier oil majors disappointed investors by failing to match the strong profit growth of larger peers, with Chevron Corp ( CVX.N ) short of estimates and Total ( TOTF.PA ) simply matching expectations. 

 The impact on Chevron's results of a weakened U.S. dollar, which fell 7 percent against a basket of currencies in the third quarter .DXY, was a big part of its profit shortfall. While refining earnings were far better than last year, both companies are wrestling with refinery issues. Total said weeks of strikes, which ended Friday, cost it 100 million euros ($139 million), while Chevron painted a bleak picture of fuel demand and overcapacity for years to come. "In the refining sector, we continue to see pretty tepid demand growth," said Mike Wirth, Chevron's executive vice president for global downstream. "Some parts of the world are certainly showing decent demand growth, others are not." He was confident about long-term prospects for Asia, where Chevron has major refining interests, but he said Asia was not uniform, with demand weak in Japan, the Philippines, Thailand and South Korea, but strong in Singapore, Vietnam and China. Asia's top oil refiner, Sinopec ( 0386.HK ), reported a 15 percent rise in profit on Thursday. Chevron reported on Friday a 1.6 percent decline in third-quarter net income from the same quarter a year before, when profits were boosted by asset sales. "This was definitely a disappointing result," Argus Research analyst Phil Weiss said, pointing to higher U.S. costs resulting largely from the Gulf of Mexico drilling moratorium that followed BP Plc's ( BP.L ) disastrous well blowout. Shares of Chevron, having outperformed those of many rivals so far in 2010, took a big hit on Friday, falling 2.2 percent, while Total shares ended slightly lower. Stripping out one-offs, Total's profit rose 32 percent, in line with the average estimates. Analysts at Simmons & Co in Houston welcomed its "logical" decision to start paying dividends every quarter, in line with peers. The largest non-government-controlled oil company by market value, Exxon Mobil Corp ( XOM.N ), reported a 55 percent jump in net income on Thursday, while its nearest rival, Royal Dutch Shell Plc ( RDSa.L ), reported an 18 percent rise, which would have been higher but for non-cash charges. Analysts at Bernstein said Shell made the other results look "slightly disappointing." Chevron and Total are the third- and fourth-largest private-sector oil majors by market value. BP is due to report its third-quarter results on November 2. PRODUCTION RISES Oil prices were around 12 percent higher in the third quarter compared with the same period last year, while U.S. and European gas prices also rose sharply. Total's production grew 4.3 percent to 2.34 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in the quarter, powered by higher gas output, as crude production fell. Chevron said production rose 1 percent in the quarter to 2.74 million boepd, but confirmed it was on track to hit its 2010 target for average output of 2.78 million boepd. Total, Europe's largest refiner, said refining margins rose 37 percent in the quarter versus the same period of 2009. Higher crude processing margins also benefited Finnish refiner Neste Oil ( NES1V.HE ), which reported a 49 percent rise in net income. As of Thursday, shares of Chevron had gained 10 percent in 2010, while the Chicago Board Options Exchange's oil company index .OIX -- which includes BP's battered shares -- was down 1 percent. Total shares have lost 13 percent so far this year.
