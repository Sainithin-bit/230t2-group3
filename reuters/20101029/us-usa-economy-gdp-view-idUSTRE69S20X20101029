 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. economic growth edged up as expected in the third quarter but not enough to chip away at high unemployment or change perceptions of more monetary easing from the Federal Reserve next week. 

 COMMENTS: HUGH JOHNSON, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, HUGH JOHNSON ADVISORS LLC, ALBANY, NEW YORK: "The overall number was clearly in line with expectations and so there's not any big surprise in the number, particularly ahead of the election and the FOMC meeting. I don't think this will be a big mover today. There were some modest surprises: international trade subtracted from the overall numbers significantly...maybe because economies of many of our major western trading nations are slowing, particularly Europe. Personal spending was a little bit stronger than had been expected, and we had a very sharp decline in housing, largely because of the expiration of the tax incentives in the quarter. "The bottom line is when I look at this report I come away with the feeling there's no significant surprise. The economy is recovering, but recovering at an anemic pace, and this certainly will help the Fed in its deliberations on Tuesday." PETER BOOCKVAR, EQUITY STRATEGIST, MILLER TABAK + CO, NEW YORK "Bottom line, growth was ordinary in Q3 after an ordinary growth rate of 1.7 percent in Q2 and unfortunately is not expected to get much better in Q4. The economy is still growing but below its potential." IAN LYNGEN, SENIOR GOVERNMENT BOND STRATEGIST, CRT CAPITAL GROUP, STAMFORD CONNECTICUT "There are a couple things that we're pointing out: This GDP release is a bit more bullish for the Treasury market than the headline suggests because we have core PCE the second lowest since 1962. Inventory rebuild accounted for 1.4 percent of the 2 percent growth in real GDP -- take away inventory and it's a notably softer quarter." "Admittedly, personal consumption did increase 2.6 percent, which is slightly above the consensus of 2.5 percent." "Overall, headline on the strong side but the details are a bit more troubling for this nascent recovery." ROBERT PAVLIK, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST AT BANYAN PARTNERS LLC IN NEW YORK: "It was right on target and futures have improved somewhat. The deflator came in a little higher than expected, but that's not the worst thing that could happen. The sales index was a below, but that's also not a huge negative. "Overall I think its a good report, but I don't know how much we're going to get out of it. The market is overhung by concerns of QE2. How much is going to come down? How big of an impact will it have? How much has been priced into the market? That's what people are focusing on." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stock index futures briefly pare losses after the GDP report. BONDS: Long-dated U.S. Treasury debt prices rise after the report. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar pares gains versus the euro after the data, extends losses versus the yen.
