 BANGALORE  (Reuters) - Analysts cheered Microsoft Corp's ( MSFT.O ) quarterly results on Friday, a day after the company squarely beat Wall Street expectations, and said the company should continue to gain as a new cycle of PC enterprise spending rolls in. 

 At least four brokerages raised their price target on the stock on expectations that the company would reap from enterprise adoption of Windows 7 and its latest suite of Office products. "Strong fiscal first-quarter results across metrics in a seasonally soft quarter are emblematic that Microsoft is finally feeling the positive impact of the enterprise upgrade cycle. In our view this will be a multi-year tailwind," UBS analyst Brent Thill said in a note to clients. In the first quarter, Microsoft's Office unit was the biggest engine, contributing $3.4 billion to profit, while the Windows unit contributed $3.3 billion. BofA Merrill Lynch said it expects to see continued strength in the Microsoft Business Division (MBD) unit, which produces the Office suite of products, for another three to four quarters, given the pattern in the last two cycles. The company launched Office 2010 in June. The analysts added that the upcoming Xbox Kinect extension and Windows Phone 7 should boost sales and make up for the lack of a formidable tablet from its stable, going into the holiday season. Microsoft, whose operating system runs on more than 90 percent of the world's personal computers, has not been able to match growth rates from its hey-day 1990s. Its stock is down 20 percent from 10 years ago. Microsoft shares have underperformed due to macro concerns, impact from Apple's iPad, and sustainability of growth in fiscal 2011, BofA Merrill analyst Kash Rangan said. "However, Windows 7 corporate PC refresh and Office 2010 alongside Win 7 tablets in 2011 continue to be catalysts and offer levers that could offset negative impact from iPad if any," he added. The company's stock trades at price to earnings multiple of 10.8 as opposed to rival Apple's P/E ratio of 15.9, according to Starmine data. The stock was up 2 percent at $26.77 in midday trading on Nasdaq. It touched a high of $27.20 earlier in the day.
