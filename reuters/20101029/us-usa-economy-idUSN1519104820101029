 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. economic growth edged up as predicted in the third quarter but not enough to chip away at high unemployment or change expectations of more monetary easing from the Federal Reserve next week. 

 Gross domestic product expanded at a 2.0 percent annual rate as consumer spending rose at its fastest pace in four years, the Commerce Department said on Friday. While consumer spending quickened and business investment continued to expand, much of the rise in demand was met by overseas production and domestic goods continued to pile up in warehouses, suggesting tepid growth in the fourth quarter. "We need stronger growth to bring down the unemployment rate and we are unlikely to see that until the second half of next year," said Gus Faucher, director of macroeconomics at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. Details of the report, which showed core inflation running at its second-lowest level since 1962, reinforced expectations the Fed will pump more money into the economy at its November 2-3 meeting to push interest rates down further and ward off deflationary pressures. Analysts look for the U.S. central bank to announce a new round of bond purchases of about $100 billion a month when its meeting concludes on Wednesday. The anemic growth pace, which matched analysts' forecasts, and prospects of looser monetary policy ignited a rally in U.S. government debt prices, while the dollar fell to within spitting distance of a 15-year low against the yen. Stocks on Wall Street ended little changed. The economy exited recession in June 2009 but growth braked abruptly in the second quarter of this year, coming in at a meager 1.7 percent rate. With unemployment at 9.6 percent, Americans are nervous about the future. Their worries are expected to lead to a shift in the country's political landscape in Tuesday's congressional elections, with Republicans wresting control of the House of Representatives from Democrats and gaining seats in the Senate. A report next Friday is expected to show U.S. employment grew in October for the first time in four months, but at a pace way too sluggish to register for the 14.8 million unemployed. President Barack Obama, whose policies have been attacked by Republicans, on Friday called for both parties to join hands to find ways to help the economy. "Our mission is to accelerate that recovery and encourage more rapid growth so that businesses can continue to prosper and we can get the millions of Americans who are still looking for jobs back to work," he said. Analysts, however, expect post-election legislative gridlock to frustrate Obama's efforts. JOBS SHORTAGE Economists say an economic growth pace of at least 3.5 percent over several quarters, driven by solid domestic demand and exports, is needed to bring down high unemployment. A pick-up in consumer spending gave the economy a lift in the third quarter. Consumer spending, which accounts for 70 percent of U.S. economic activity, increased at a 2.6 percent rate after rising 2.2 percent in the prior period. The third-quarter gain was the largest since the fourth quarter of 2006 and added 1.79 percentage points to GDP growth. Spending, however, could soften. A separate report showed consumer sentiment weakened a touch in October, dropping to its lowest level in nearly a year. Output in the third quarter was also supported by a big rise in business inventories. Excluding inventories, the economy expanded at a 0.6 percent pace, slowing from 0.9 percent in the second quarter. The rise in inventories against the backdrop of high unemployment raises the possibility that companies are restocking shelves more quickly than consumers are willing to empty them, which could limit fourth-quarter growth. "This mix between inventories and final demand at least right now looks unfavorable," said Brian Jones, senior economist at Societe Generale in New York. "There are two ways for that gap to be closed. The first is you have a production slowdown that reins in inventories ... (or) you need a pick-up in demand to close that gap." Although the build-up in inventories suggests slower production ahead, a report on manufacturing activity in the U.S. Midwest region showed production rising. The GDP report showed business spending continued to rise in the July-September quarter, but the pace slowed from the prior period, with notable moderation in investment in equipment and software after three quarters of robust growth. Growth was also held back as imports outpaced exports. But the trade gap narrowed somewhat during the quarter, weighing less heavily on the economy than in the prior three months. Residential construction was also a drag on output in the third quarter as a tax credit for home buyers ended, while government spending made a modest contribution. The report showed the Fed's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index, excluding food and energy, rose at an annual rate of 0.8 percent in the third quarter. That was the smallest increase since the fourth quarter of 2008 and the second-lowest reading since the fourth quarter of 1962. Fed officials have signaled concern that low inflation could ultimately turn into pernicious deflation if the recovery does not strengthen. (Editing by Dan Grebler)
