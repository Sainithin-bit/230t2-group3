 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Standard & Poor's stripped General Electric Co of its top-tier "AAA" credit rating on Thursday, citing concerns about its hefty finance arm. 

 Shares of the U.S. conglomerate rallied about 10 percent as investors took heart in the fact that the agency lowered GE's rating and that of GE Capital by just one notch and set its outlook at "stable," meaning that it is unlikely that there will be further changes in the next six months to two years. GE ended 2008 with $523.76 billion in outstanding short- and long-term debt, making it one of the largest corporate issuers. Below are some questions and answers about the downgrade: WHAT DOES S&P'S DOWNGRADE TO "AA-PLUS" MEAN FOR GE? Lowering the company's credit rating could make it more expensive for the world's largest maker of jet engines and electricity-producing turbines to raise money by selling bonds. But investors have been expecting a downgrade for some time and GE's bonds have not been trading at the levels that would be typical of "AAA" rated debt. "From a funding cost perspective, their bonds were trading significantly cheaper than even an 'AA-plus,' so this should not create new pressures," said Wayne Titche, co-manager of the AHA Diversified Equity Fund at AMBS Investments in Grand Rapids, Michigan, whose company invests in both GE stock and its bonds. The Fairfield, Connecticut-based company also retains the ability to sell "AAA" rated bond through the U.S. government's Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program. As of March 10, GE had raised $40 billion of the $45 billion it had targeted to raise on debt markets in 2009. WHAT IS THE NEXT STEP FOR GE'S CREDIT RATING? While S&P's outlook on GE is now stable, Moody's Investors Service, which also applies its top rating to the company, continues to review the company for possible downgrade. "We would anticipate a similar outcome," from the rival service's review, Deutsche Bank analyst Nigel Coe wrote in a note to investors. Moody's put GE on review on January 28 and typically the company tries to complete its reviews within 90 days. WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF GE'S RATING WERE CUT FURTHER? GE said on Thursday that S&P's move "will have no impact on our funding or operations." Its credit ratings would have to be cut much further -- another three notches to single-A range, to change GE's funding requirements, according to filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. A cut to "single-A" range could put the company on the hook for $8.2 billion in collateral related to certain investment contracts. A more dramatic downgrade to the "triple-B" range would require it to post another $2.9 billion. WHAT ABOUT COMMERCIAL PAPER? S&P held GE's short-term rating steady at "A-1-plus," its top level, which should not change GE's status in the commercial paper market, which companies use for short-term borrowing. Like most commercial paper issuers, GE was challenged last fall when that market briefly locked up. Since then it has worked to cut back its reliance on commercial paper, and now has about $60 billion of it outstanding, down from $88 billion in the third quarter, which ended in September.
