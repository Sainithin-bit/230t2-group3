 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Independent stores and local businesses are closing up shop across the United States as the recession hits American cities' main streets, the National League of Cities reported on Thursday. 

 Calling the trend a "retail meltdown," the group said that in three out of five cities at least one local retailer has shut down in the past year. At the same time, 64 percent of city officials said their towns' retail sales are down and more than 70 percent say poor sales and closed stores are hurting other local businesses and hindering start-ups. The Commerce Department earlier reported that retail sales excluding gasoline fell 0.4 percent nation-wide in February. Also, about 80 percent of those polled said the retail slowdown was having a negative impact on the regional economy. The league warned that many cities have become reliant on sales taxes over the last year to keep their governments and social programs afloat. To bring in more taxes, many cities in had encouraged large retail development. As stores close, they must find new funding sources. Also on Thursday, the Rockefeller Institute of Government reported that state tax revenue tumbled 3.6 percent in last year's fourth quarter from a year before, and sales taxes, which fell 5.9 percent, made up the bulk of the decline. Recent radical drops in consumer spending and confidence have been blamed for problems in the national economy, ranging from a general slowdown in growth to the declining automobile sector. The survey of 1,670 random municipal officials across the country was conducted in January and February. (additional reporting by Karen Pierog in Chicago; Editing by Tom Hals)
