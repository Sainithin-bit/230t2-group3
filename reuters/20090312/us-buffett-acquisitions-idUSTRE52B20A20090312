 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett said he sees buying opportunities in the United States for his company, Berkshire Hathaway Inc ( BRKa.N )( BRKb.N ), as prices fall and bidders drop out, Bloomberg reported. 

 "The way things are going, there's a lot of things that may be happening in the United States," Buffett told Bloomberg Television in an interview. "The odds favor" a domestic deal for Berkshire, he said, even though he added: "I could get a call tomorrow about some company in the UK or Germany." "I'm open for business, but it's got to be the best business in town," Buffett said. "I wanted a possible kicker." he said on Berkshire's investments on Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) and General Electric Co ( GE.N ), while adding he did not know if Berkshire would make money by exercising the warrants in either company. "I think the odds are reasonably good we do them. Maybe we'll do it on one and not the other, but in the end I was satisfied with the preferred I was getting," Buffett said. Berkshire was awarded warrants to by Goldman shares at $115 per share as part of a September 23 deal. On October 1 the company was awarded options to buy GE common stock at $22.25 per share. Goldman shares closed at $92.39 on Wednesday while GE shares closed at $8.49. Buffett expressed his confidence on GE and its Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Immelt. "They've got the earnings power to work things through," Buffett said. Immelt is "a terrific manager that has a business that has lots of tough sledding ahead." GE shares slumped last week on worries that its finance arm GE Capital does not have adequate reserves to cope with an expected rise in delinquencies on its loans.
