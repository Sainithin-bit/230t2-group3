 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Sales at U.S. retailers fell by a smaller-than-expected margin in February after a surprise gain the prior month, as a rise in gasoline prices limited the impact of slumping vehicle sales, a government report showed on Thursday. 

 The number of U.S. workers filing new claims for jobless benefits rose 9,000 last week and so-called continued claims notched a fresh record as a year-long U.S. recession continued to slam the labor market, data on Thursday showed. KEY POINTS: RETAIL SALES: * The Commerce Department said total retail sales eased 0.1 percent after rising by a revised 1.8 percent in January, previously reported as a 1.0 percent increase. * Excluding motor vehicles and parts, sales increased 0.7 percent in February, compared to a 1.6 percent advance the previous month. * Vehicle sales plunged 4.3 percent, after a surprise 3.1 percent rise the prior month. * Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast February retail sales falling by 0.5 percent. * Excluding motor vehicles, sales had been predicted to ease by 0.2 percent. * Gasoline sales climbed 3.4 percent, the biggest rise since November 2007, after increasing by 2.8 percent in January. Sales of building materials dipped 0.2 percent in February after slipping 1.3 percent in the prior month. JOBLESS CLAIMS: * The Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment insurance benefits increased to a seasonally adjusted 654,000 in the week ended March 7 from a revised 645,000 the week before. * Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast 645,000 new claims versus a previously reported count of 639,000 the week before. COMMENTS: DAVID SLOAN, ECONOMIST, 4CAST LTD, NEW YORK: "(Retail sales) were stronger than expected, particularly with the upward revisions to January. We'd seen that the chain store data had exceeded expectations, so we were looking for some improvement. The numbers are quite surprising though, consumer spending may even manage an increase in the first quarter, or if they decline, they won't decline by very much unless we get a very weak March. Obviously there have been a lot of negatives but with gasoline prices having fallen, real disposable income has increased and that is giving the consumer some cushion. Given that gasoline prices are probably going to stabilize, I think real disposable income will be difficult to sustain, so I'm not sure the consumer has necessarily seen a bottom yet, but definitely they are encouraging figures. "The jobless numbers were pretty bad. There was a very high figure on initial claims two weeks ago that was probably distorted because of the Presidents Day holiday but the underlying trend in both initial and continuing claims is continuing to deteriorate." BULENT BAYGUN, HEAD, U.S. INTEREST RATE STRATEGY, BNP PARIBAS, NEW YORK: "In any downturn you will always, almost invariably, get some better than expected numbers because the forecasts constantly keep being revised downwards." DAN FARETTA, SENIOR MARKET STRATEGIST, LIND-WALDOCK, CHICAGO: "The retail sales are better than expected. Hard to say what the reasoning is. I think we're starting to see the bottom in the numbers, just because they've been down for so long. The numbers have been so bad for so long that this is good news, and good news in this market is a positive thing. I think you'll see a little bounce in the market on this - it won't get a lot of credit for the bounce - but I think you'll see it. "The jobless figure was about in line, and that's the same thing as the retail numbers. For the past couple of months they've been down a lot, and we might now start to see a bottom in them. They're starting to flatline and come in with estimates. Hopefully this is a bottom and we'll start to see some turnaround. I think in the coming months we'll see some numbers that are worse than expected, but it looks like its slowing down." PIERRE ELLIS, SENIOR GLOBAL ECONOMIST, DECISION ECONOMICS, NEW  YORK: RETAIL SALES: "We are hitting bedrock levels on consumer spending. We are seeing a faint upward drift in consumer spending and an eventual end to the consumer recession." JOBLESS CLAIMS: "It confirms the labour market is deteriorating further in March. Layoffs are stepping up further and we are seeing there is no corresponding pickup in new hiring. This is very bad momentum into this downturn. The GDP is being marked down with each week of numbers rolling in." MICHAEL WOOLFOLK, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST, THE BANK OF NEW YORK-MELLON: "The data was vastly better than we expected. There's stability in these numbers, particularly when you strip out autos and gas. So clearly the consumer is not completely knocked out. The difficulty, though, is we still need jobs growth and credit markets to thaw out before we can have a normal recovery, and we don't have that yet. Still, for today, if anything, I think this will feed into the decline in risk aversion and will contribute to dollar softness against the euro and sterling." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: S&P 500 index futures turn positive after retail sales data. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices pare gains. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar trims losses versus yen.
