 BEIJING  (Reuters) - Chinese urban consumers are slightly more confident about their future incomes, encouraging them to want to spend a little more and save less, according to a quarterly central bank survey released on Thursday. 

 The index measuring consumer confidence in income increases climbed to 17.7 percent in the first quarter, up 4.5 percentage points from the last three months of 2008, the survey found. The central bank said that 29.6 percent of those polled thought consuming more was a good idea, up 3.5 percentage points from the fourth quarter. The proportion of those who thought that bank deposits were the best place to put their money fell 7.3 percentage points to 37.5 percent, in part because current interest rates were so low, the central bank said. The survey, which was published on the People's Bank of China website (www.pbc.gov.cn), was conducted in the middle of February in 50 big, medium and small cities across the country.
