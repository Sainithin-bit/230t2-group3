 (Reuters) - Nokia Siemens Networks has held talks with Nortel over some of the businesses the struggling Canadian firm plans to sell, but no decisions have been made on either side, a source familiar with the talks said on Thursday. 

 Nokia Siemens Networks has bought a few smaller companies since it started operations in 2007 and has not ruled out further acquisitions that were consistent with its focus on profitability and cash flow. Barry French, head of communications at Nokia Siemens Networks, refused to comment on what he called "market rumors and speculation." Nortel also declined comment. Ailing telecom equipment maker Nortel Networks Corp, which filed for bankruptcy protection earlier this year, is looking to break itself up by selling off major divisions, the Globe and Mail reported on Thursday. In January, the company filed for bankruptcy protection in Canada, the United States and elsewhere, in a bid to try to restructure while keeping creditors at bay.
