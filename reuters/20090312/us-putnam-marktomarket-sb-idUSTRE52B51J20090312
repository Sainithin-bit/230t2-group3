 BOSTON  (Reuters) - The head of a prominent U.S. mutual fund firm urged policymakers to relax accounting rules that require companies to value often illiquid securities, arguing the move could boost ailing markets. 

 "The suspension of mark-to-market accounting would really help the markets," Robert Reynolds, chief executive of Putnam Investments, told a group of bankers and business people on Thursday. Reynolds is the latest high-profile executive to speak out against an accounting rule that many financial company chiefs say has caused their share prices to drop dramatically. He made his comments as lawmakers in Washington held a hearing related to mark-to-market accounting. Boston-based Putnam invests $96 billion and is a unit of Canadian insurer Great West Lifeco Inc ( GWO.TO ). If the mark-to-market rule, in place for only a few years, were altered, many banks and financial companies would be able to revalue their so-called toxic assets. Financial executives have been lobbying to repeal the rule. Reynolds said the rule had hurt companies' balance sheets at a time where the country needs to restore confidence in the financial system to give markets a shot in the arm. Representative Paul Kanjorski, whose House of Representatives Financial Services subcommittee was holding the hearing, said on Thursday the time to change the rule was next quarter and that modifications would be in the best interests of all. Reynolds, who took the top job at Putnam in 2008 after a long career at mutual fund firm Fidelity Investments, said some financial firms that collapsed recently would still be in business if the mark-to-market rule had been less strict. "Balance sheets are getting artificially hit when they should not be," he said at the breakfast meeting. He also urged the government to stop propping up ailing companies that have no viability. "I really hope they won't keep zombie companies on life support," Reynolds said in prepared remarks. Asked specifically whether taxpayer money should be used to keep supporting American International Group Inc ( AIG.N ) or U.S. carmakers, he said: "Let them go, absent a plan of how to get out of this situation. And coming back every quarter and asking for money is not a plan." Reynolds spoke out in favor of nationalizing U.S. banks, a controversial measure that could wipe out equity and debt holders. He said any nationalization should be short, and a plan should be in place to reprivatize. Putnam Investments is one of a large number of institutional investors in Citigroup Inc ( C.N ), one of the nation's biggest ailing banks. (Reporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss; editing by John Wallace)
