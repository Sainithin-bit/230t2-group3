 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp's ( BAC.N ) top executive defended Thursday the bank's spending on sports marketing activities at a time when such deals are under fire as wasteful. 

 Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis, speaking to the Chief Executive Officers Club of Boston, said the multimillion-dollar sports marketing deals at Bank of America are worth the investment because they generate sales and profits. "I was never inclined to pump big sums of money into sports marketing until I saw the facts and the numbers," he said. "In general terms, for every dollar we spend on sports marketing, we get $10 in revenue and $3 in earnings. This is not wasted money." Bank of America does not disclose how much it spends on sponsorships, but revenue generated by such deals comes from the sales of sports-themed consumer banking products, as well as providing financial services to sports leagues and teams. The bank spent $120 million to $125 million in 2007 on U.S. sponsorships including sports deals, according to IEG, a unit of ad giant WPP Plc ( WPP.L ) that tracks such spending. That was the last year IEG provided estimates for individual companies. The value of North American sports industry, including franchise values, athlete endorsements and broadcast rights, was estimated at $225 billion in 2006 by Street & Smith's SportsBusiness Journal. Bonuses, perks and other spending by banks that were long considered acceptable have grown politically untenable as the U.S. government pumps hundreds of billions of dollars of taxpayer money to help revive the banking system.
