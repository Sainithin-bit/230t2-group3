 SAO PAULO  (Reuters) - Top finance officials from leading economies have reached consensus on the need for coordinated action to fight the global financial crisis, Australia's top finance official said on Saturday. 

 "I think there is a consensus on the need for coordinated and decisive action globally, going to first of all fiscal policy," Australian Treasurer Wayne Swan told Reuters on the sidelines of a meeting of the Group of 20 countries that covers the world's biggest economies. "It's very important that those countries which have the capacity to stimulate their economy do so." Swan said in an interview there was also agreement on the need for a further loosening of monetary policy "in different parts of the world."
