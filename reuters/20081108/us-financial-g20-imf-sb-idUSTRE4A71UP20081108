 SAO PAULO  (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund wants next weekend's G20 leaders' summit in Washington to discuss additional monetary and fiscal policy response to the global financial crisis. 

 In a letter dated November 6 to the heads of government of the Group of 20, which includes advanced and big emerging economies, IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn also said the G20 leaders must be willing to ensure that the IMF is adequately funded to help alleviate the global credit crunch. "Additional monetary and fiscal policy responses need to be on the agenda," Strauss-Kahn said in the letter, which was obtained by Reuters on Saturday. "There is scope for fiscal expansion in many advanced and some emerging market economies; and with inflation declining, some central banks have scope for further monetary easing," it added.
