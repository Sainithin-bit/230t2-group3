 HANOI  (Reuters) - Vietnam will cut retail petrol and diesel prices by up to 7.2 percent later on Saturday, state-run online newspapers reported, citing the Finance Ministry. 

 Retail prices for the popular 92-octane petrol would be cut 6.7 percent to 14,000 dong (84.8 U.S. cents) from 15,000 dong now, the VNExpress site (www.vnexpress.net) said without giving an exact timing for the price reduction. Prices of diesel with 0.25 percent sulphur would also be cut 7.2 percent to 12,950 dong per liter, from 13,950 dong now. ($1=16,501 dong) (Reporting by  Ho Binh Minh ; Editing by  Tomasz Janowski )
