 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Movie rental chain Blockbuster Inc. BBI.N is in talks to sell pieces of its international operations including its Taiwan arm, Chief Executive John Antioco said on Tuesday. 

 "We've had ongoing discussions, some of which have been recent," Antioco said at the Reuters Media Summit. He said Blockbuster has had approaches from private equity firms for parts of the international business, but he did not name the firms or specify which countries. "There have been private equity firms that have looked at some of our international assets," he said. "I think most likely there's no one that would want to buy all of our international operations." Antioco confirmed an approach for its Taiwan arm from Webs-TV Digital International, which was reported last week in a local technology trade publication. "We have had discussions with people in Taiwan that filed a regulatory document indicating that they were attempting to buy Blockbuster Taiwan, and that very well may be what happens," Antioco said. Dallas-based Blockbuster has about 2,600 stores outside the United States, including the United Kingdom, Brazil and Canada, which account for about 25 percent of the company's revenue. The company has no plans to shutter its UK business despite struggling in an increasingly cutthroat online rental market. Blockbuster has recently installed new management to help turn the unit around. "I think we can do some things better there," Antioco said. "I don't believe any kind of exit, absent a sale, is imminent for the UK."
