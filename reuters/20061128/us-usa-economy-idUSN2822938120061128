 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - New orders for U.S.-made durable goods registered their sharpest fall in six years last month and consumer confidence fell in November, reports showed on Tuesday, lending support to views the Federal Reserve will trim interest rates next year. 

 Separate data on a surprising rise in October sales of existing homes somewhat tempered the signs of economic weakness, while comments by Fed chairman Ben Bernanke reinforced the view the Fed sees more risk from inflation creeping higher than growth slowing. The reports may signal the economy is growing at a rate below its full potential, which the Fed has hoped would lessen inflation pressures, analysts said. "The economy is unfolding in a way that is perhaps slightly on the weak side, but it is taking some of the pressure out of the system, some of the overheating that we saw that was causing a lot of concern at the Federal Reserve," said Brian Bethune, U.S. economist for Global Insight in Lexington, Massachusetts. The weaker-than-expected report on durable goods orders led financial markets to bet more heavily on interest-rate cuts next year, but the housing data and Bernanke's hawkish remarks led traders to scale those bets back. Speaking at a luncheon in New York, Bernanke said measures of core inflation, which strip out volatile food and energy costs, should ease gradually. He said, however, that risks to that forecast were still to the upside -- remarks analysts saw suggesting little scope for near-term rate cuts. Bernanke also said the slowdown in the U.S. housing market had so far had little spillover effect on the rest of the economy and he said housing might already be stabilizing. A report from the  National Association of Realtors, which showed a surprise rise in existing home sales to a 6.24 million-unit annual rate in October, supported that view. It was the first increase since February and bucked expectations on Wall Street for a further slowdown. "The improvement in the existing home sales is the key since the housing market is seen as the major negative for the U.S. economy," said Brian Dolan, director of research for Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey. BOTTOM IN SIGHT? The pickup in home resales came on the back of falling prices. The industry group said the median home price dropped 3.5 percent from year-ago levels, the largest decline since records began in 1968. While that spurred sales, inventories of homes for sale still rose 1.9 percent from September to 3.85 million units. A separate report showed U.S. consumer confidence fell unexpectedly in November as Americans grew more pessimistic about the job market. The Conference Board said its index of consumer sentiment slid to 102.9 this month from 105.1 in October. It was the lowest reading since August. "Despite this retreat in confidence, the overall level of confidence remains favorable and continues to suggest that the economy will expand throughout the first half of next year," said Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board Consumer Research Center. Orders for durables goods -- big-ticket items like cars, refrigerators and aircraft, expected to last three years or longer -- fell 8.3 percent last month, the biggest drop since July 2000, the Commerce Department said. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected orders to drop, but by just 4.6 percent. The decline was propelled by a 21.7 percent fall in transportation orders, as non-defense aircraft orders plummeted 44.5 percent after a 198.2 percent surge in September. But even excluding transportation, orders declined by 1.7 percent, with manufacturing, fabricated metal and computers and electronics orders all sliding. Analysts had expected to see a slight rise in orders outside of transportation. "The numbers look weaker than the Fed has been counting on in terms of maintaining stability to the economy," said Pierre Ellis, a senior economist at Decision Economics in New York. A proxy for business spending, orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, also took an unexpected dive, off 5.1 percent. Analysts were anticipating a 0.3 percent rise in that category.
