 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - ServiceMaster Co. ( SVM.N ), which has faced higher costs while struggling to retain customers, said on Tuesday it was considering putting itself up for sale, sending shares up more than 10 percent. 

 The lawn care and pest control company's solid cash flow and low operating costs have attracted the interest of private equity firms in recent weeks, according to industry sources. The company, which has a market value of about $3.5 billion, said it was exploring strategic alternatives and had hired Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs as financial advisers and Sidley Austin as legal adviser. CL King & Associates analyst Jim Barrett said financial buyers could be interested in at least parts of the company, while a rival like Scotts Miracle-Gro Co. ( SMG.N ) could also emerge as a buyer of some segments. "If ServiceMaster were sold today, we think it would command a modest premium," Barrett wrote in a research note. "If we are approximately correct on ServiceMaster's takeout value, shareholders would be better off waiting, hoping that the new management team can ignite growth at the company, especially since shareholders receive a 4 percent dividend for waiting," Barrett said. ServiceMaster said at an investor conference on Tuesday that it would focus more on retaining customers and employees, and would emphasize direct-mail marketing for its core brands, which include TruGreen Lawn Care, American Home Shield appliance warranties, and Terminix pest control. Executives said the company generates strong cash flow, has low requirements for capital expenditures and faces little risk from new technology or global competition. They said improved sales methods and new services like a termite inspection service would help drive growth. "We have had a challenging year in 2006 but we are not at all discouraged," Chief Financial Officer Ernie Mrozek told investors and analysts. Mrozek cited declines in telemarketing, adverse weather, weak housing market and a weak termite season, for hurting 2006 results, and said the company also saw higher costs for fuel, health care and interest expenses. Asked if the company would consider breaking up its portfolio of brands, Chief Executive J. Patrick Spainhour said: "The board is open to looking at any alternatives out there." Spainhour also said ServiceMaster's corporate culture -- which counts "Honoring God" among its objectives -- would not be a barrier to a sale. The Downers Grove, Illinois-based company, which plans to relocate its headquarters to Memphis, Tennessee, said it expects to report high-single-digit revenue growth and low-double-digit earnings-per-share growth in 2007. It said it would pursue a transaction if it delivered more value to shareholders than its updated business plan. "We're not asking you to sit and give us the time to make these things happen," said Spainhour, who took over as CEO in June. "These things are happening now." ServiceMaster shares rose $1.21 to $13.11 in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, after earlier reaching its highest level in more than a year. The stock has jumped 35 percent since July, when it touched a 52-week low of $9.66. In August, ServiceMaster said it would increase its share buyback in the second half of the year for a full-year total of about $150 million of stock. In October it sold its American Residential Services unit to Caxton-Iseman Capital Inc. and Royal Palm Capital Partners Inc. for about $100 million. Earlier this month it reported lower quarterly profit, citing higher raw material costs, hot summer weather and higher claims in its American Home Shield business.
