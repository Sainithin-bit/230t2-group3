 (Corrects to add dropped word "growth" in fifth paragraph)
 NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc. ( PFE.N ) said on Tuesday it would cut its U.S. sales force by about 20 percent, or some 2,200 jobs, as part of a comprehensive cost-cutting program. 

 The world's No. 1 drugmaker said it will present its long-term outlook and additional actions for transforming the company in January. The job cuts are coming from all levels of Pfizer's sales organization from senior management to field representatives, Pfizer spokesman Paul Fitzhenry said. Pfizer said in mid-October that it would review every aspect of its operations. Its cost-cutting efforts are aimed at producing annual savings of $4 billion a year by 2008, the company said. Hampered by declining sales of its older medicines and a failure to launch many new drugs, the company has said it expects to record no profit growth in 2006 and does not anticipate revenue growth until 2009. There are currently about 11,000 positions in its U.S. sales organization and Pfizer said it would still be able to maintain sales support for all of its major product lines.
