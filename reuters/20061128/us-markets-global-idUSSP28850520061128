 LONDON  (Reuters) - Confidence in the strength of the European economy lifted the euro to a record high against the yen on Tuesday, with European stocks also outperforming as energy stocks rallied on oil above $60 a barrel. 

 Euro zone government bonds also rose, helped by dovish comments from a Federal Reserve official, slower than expected money supply growth and the strength in the single currency. The euro's rally has seen it rise as much as 5.5 percent against the greenback since mid-October, but European policymakers were mostly sanguine about the gains and the possible impact of the region's export-dependent economy. Speaking at a European Union finance ministers meeting, Austrian finance minister Karl-Heinz Grasser said the euro's strength was "nothing special at all", while Eurogroup chairman Jean-Claude Juncker said the current euro exchange rate was not a cause for concern. "The general thinking is clearly they (ministers) have come out and said, quite rightly, the exchange rate is a reflection of a stronger European economy," said Jeremy Hodges, head of FX sales at Lloyds TSB. "I also think the U.S. are not going to be that unhappy about it either as a weaker dollar helps them generally with the deficit despite rhetoric about a strong dollar policy," he added. The OECD in its half-yearly global outlook said strong growth in the euro zone warranted interest rates continuing to rise, possibly for longer than markets expect. In comparison, U.S. growth was revised lower and could lead to a cut in interest rate, the Paris-based think tank said. By 1014 GMT, the euro was slightly firmer at $1.3152  EUR= , not far from Monday's 20-month high around $1.3180, and trading at 152.95 yen EURJPY=, a fresh record peak. The dollar nudged higher against the yen to 116.25  JPY= . EUROPEAN STOCKS OUTPERFORM European stocks managed to shrug off the threat to earnings from a stronger euro and a poor performance from offshore markets overnight to edge higher in morning trade. The FTSEurofirst 300 Index  .FTEU3  rose 0.1 percent to 1,430.5 points, having tumbled 1.5 percent the previous session. The index was boosted by oil stocks including Total ( TOTF.PA ) and BP ( BP.L ) which rose as forecasts for cold weather in the U.S. Northeast combined with warnings from Saudi Arabia about further possible cuts to production to support oil above $60 a barrel. Wall Street suffered its worst fall in six months on Monday, which spilled over into Asian markets overnight. Japan's Nikkei average  .N225  closed 0.2 percent weaker at 15,855.3 points, off its lows, while MSCI's index of Asian stocks outside Japan .MSCIAPJ fell 1.7 percent. Early signs the key retail holiday season has not started well in the United States have rattled some investors already concerned about a slump in the U.S. housing market spilling over into spending. BONDS FIRM Dallas Federal Reserve President Richard Fisher voiced his concern over the housing market in an interview with Germany's Handelsblatt newspaper, saying it was a "very serious problem". His comments supported euro zone government bonds as markets continued to speculate whether or not the Fed's next move will be a cut in interest rates. Softer-than-forecast M3 money supply data from the euro zone also lent support to bunds. The December Bund future FGBLZ6 rose 12 ticks to 118.30, while the yield on 10-year bonds EU10YT=RR dipped to 3.71 percent.
