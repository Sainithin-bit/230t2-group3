 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Boeing Co. ( BA.N ) won its second multibillion-dollar order in as many weeks on Tuesday, as German airline Air Berlin ( AB1.DE ) said it would buy 60 of its 737 jets, worth about $4.2 billion at list prices. 

 The deal comes on top of 15 orders for 737s that Air Berlin picked up in August when it acquired rival German carrier DBA, and a further 10 737s from a previous Air Berlin order. Overall, Germany's No. 2 airline is now set to receive 85 of the single-aisle jets, worth about $5.7 billion at list prices. The order is the largest ever for 737s from Germany, and comes a week after Boeing received a $5.5 billion order for 25 passenger and freighter aircraft from Korean Air Co.  ( 003490.KS ). The recent run of orders extends Boeing's lead over European rival Airbus, which has been struggling with an array of design and production problems on its commercial jets. Not including the new Air Berlin order, the U.S. planemaker has 822 firm orders on its books so far this year, ahead of Airbus with 619. Boeing is staging a comeback after being beaten by Airbus, which is majority owned by EADS ( EAD.PA ), in annual plane orders for the past five years. Boeing may yet break its own record order figure of 1,002 last year. The 737-800 Next Generation aircraft are to be delivered between 2007 and 2014. Air Berlin's DBA unit is to receive 25 of the planes. Air Berlin's most recent plane orders were with Airbus in 2004, when it ordered 10 A320 jets. The return to Boeing stems from Air Berlin's acquisition of DBA, which already had Boeing 737s on order. The carrier said it plans to maintain both Airbus and Boeing planes in its fleet, which currently numbers 62 aircraft. (Additional reporting by  Chris Reiter  and  Eva Kuehnen )
