 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Reckson Associates Realty Corp. RA.N has asked potential suitor, a partnership of Carl Icahn and Macklowe Associates, to pick up the pace in making a definitive bid for the New York office building owner. 

 In a letter to the entities controlled by Icahn and Harry and William Macklowe, Reckson said by Wednesday it wanted more information concerning the bidder's proposed financing for its $4.6 billion offer, including commitment letters for funding, Reckson said in a filing on Tuesday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The Icahn/Macklowe group has until Friday to submit a definitive proposal for Reckson, according to the filing. About two weeks ago the Icahn/Macklowe group offered in a nonbinding bid to buy Reckson for $49 per share. The offer came about a week before Reckson shareholders were scheduled to vote on a definitive offer from rival real estate investment trust SL Green Realty Corp. ( SLG.N ). SL Green has agreed to buy Reckson in a cash-and-stock deal worth roughly $4.01 billion, or about $46.02 per share, based on an SL Green share price of $138.03. Shares of Reckson on Tuesday were off about 7 cents, and traded at $48.89, while SL Green share were up more than 2 percent, or $3.13 per share.
