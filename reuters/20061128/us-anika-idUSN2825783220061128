 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Anika Therapeutics Inc. ( ANIK.O ) said on Tuesday it received conditional approval from U.S. health regulators for its injectable filler for facial wrinkles. 

 The company said it expects final approval from the Food and Drug Administration by the end of this year, sending Anika shares more than 30 percent higher. Anika did not specify what conditions the FDA had set before the agency will give its outright approval for the sale of the cosmetic tissue augmentation treatment. But the conditions were likely not particularly onerous given the company's confidence that final approval will come within the next month. The soft tissue filler, based on chemically modified hyaluronic acid, would also be used to treat scars and for lip augmentation, Anika said. "This approval is an important step toward commercialization of a family of dermal filler products worldwide," Anika Chief Executive Charles Sherwood said in a statement. Anika said it expects to file amendments with the FDA and European regulators to enhance product features prior to launch of the wrinkle treatment. Sale of the enhanced version is expected to begin in mid-2007, the company said. Anika shares jumped $3.73 to $15.29 on Nasdaq, where it was among the day's top percentage gainers. The annual global market for cosmetic fillers has been estimated at $400 million to $500 million, Anika said.
