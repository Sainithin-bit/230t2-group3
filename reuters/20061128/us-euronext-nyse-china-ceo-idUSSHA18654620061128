 SHANGHAI  (Reuters) - NYSE Group Inc. Chief Executive John Thain said on Tuesday he was confident that shareholders of pan-European bourse Euronext would approve its planned merger with the New York Stock Exchange. 

 "Yes, I'm confident," Thain told reporters at the CEIBS business school in Shanghai, his first stop during a four-day China trip, when asked if he felt he would win support from Euronext shareholders. Thain said he believed European regulators would approve the merger soon after shareholders of both companies voted for it. Paris-based Euronext said last week it would ask shareholders to vote on a proposed merger with NYSE Group, parent company of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). An extraordinary meeting for the vote will be held on December 19. Euronext management in June accepted a $10 billion takeover proposal by NYSE, a deal both firms say is a merger of equals. "A new company will be created, which will be called NYSE-Euronext," said Thain, former president of Wall Street investment bank Goldman Sachs. "That (new company) will be the parent company of two main branches of companies -- one branch will be NYSE Group, which will have the New York Stock Exchange, and the other one is Euronext NV," he said. Last week, the French market watchdog said it and a group of European regulators would publish their conclusions on the planned tie-up by the start of December. There has been concern in Europe that strict U.S. accounting and governance rules such as the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley law could be extended to Euronext markets through the merger. However, Thain said there should be no problem for current regulators continuing to supervise the two exchanges. "Regulatory structure will be maintained," said Thain. "The U.S. market will continue to be regulated by the SEC (Securities and Exchanges Commission) ... Euronext will also continue to be regulated by its current French and Dutch regulators," he said. Thain noted that the creation of the new NYSE-Euronext will become "the first truly global market place", which will bring benefits to listed companies as well their investors. CHINA MISSION Thain said he was on a mission to attract more listings from Chinese companies to the world's largest stock market. He said he would meet a number of Chinese companies planning overseas listings during his trip. He will fly to Beijing on Wednesday to meet local regulators to negotiate setting up a NYSE office in China, according to officials with Thain. "I am optimistic that we can get permission soon," he said. No foreign bourse has been allowed to establish an office in the mainland yet, partly because Beijing wants Chinese companies to list domestically first so local investors get the benefit of fast economic growth. None of the three biggest state banks in China, including top lender Industrial & Commercial Bank, which raised about US$22 billion in the world's largest-ever initial public offering in October, chose to list in New York. Thain said he did not think these Chinese banks were not qualified to list on NYSE but new U.S. securities regulations, such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, may have deterred them. Thain said he would like to see the likes of China's top property lender Construction Bank listing in New York. In the meantime, Thain said he believed stock exchange industry consolidation would also happen in Asia, but he said it didn't necessarily mean by takeovers as it could also be by cooperation agreements. "Globalisation will reach Asia, and I believe there will be a small number of global market players," he said. "NYSE and Euronext combine the largest market in U.S. dollars and the largest market in euros, and it makes sense to have an Asia piece to that," he said.
