 LONDON  (Reuters) - British bid-target ITV ( ITV.L ) has poached BBC Chairman Michael Grade as its new executive chairman, a major coup for the ailing commercial broadcaster and a heavy blow to the British Broadcasting Corporation. 

 Analysts said the charismatic 63-year-old was one of very few people who could rejuvenate Britain's biggest commercial TV group, which has lost audience, advertisers and its chief executive in the last year. Earlier this month, cable operator NTL NTLI.O said it was considering making a bid for ITV, before its rival UK pay-TV firm BSkyB ( BSY.L ) stepped in and blocked the move by buying a 17.9 percent stake for almost one billion pounds. NTL's biggest shareholder Richard Branson has appealed to the media regulator and the UK government to intervene, saying the move by James Murdoch's BSkyB was bad for competition. Analysts at Numis said they expected the bid speculation to evaporate and described Grade's appointment as a potential masterstroke. ITV shares rose 1.1 percent by 1022 GMT on Tuesday to 113-3/4 pence each. "My first priority at ITV will be to support the team in accelerating the improvement in programing performance for our viewers and advertisers," Grade, who was named executive chairman, said in a statement. The BBC said it was disappointed to be losing its chairman and said the announcement was a surprise. Jeff Randall, a former BBC business editor, who broke the story in the Daily Telegraph, said there was "carnage" at the BBC following the news and described one former colleague as saying that senior management was "incandescent with rage". Grade was appointed as BBC chairman in 2004 for a four-year contract, joining the renowned broadcaster at a time of turmoil following its furious row with the government over the corporation's reporting in the run-up to the Iraq war. In addition to improving morale, Grade was also tasked with the difficult job of negotiating with the government over increasing the license fee -- a tax on Britain's television-owning households. The department of Culture, Media and Sport is set to make an announcement by the end of this year on BBC funding. "The timing of Michael Grade's departure to ITV could hardly be worse for the BBC," Robert Peston, BBC News' business editor, was quoted on the company's Web site as saying. "As one member of the BBC board of governors put it to me, it's a mess." CHALLENGES Grade will face similar challenges when he joins ITV. The company has been without a boss since former chief executive Charles Allen said he would step down in August. ITV, home to "Coronation Street" and "The X Factor", has seen its share price drop 13 percent this year along with audience figures and advertising revenue in the face of competition from the Internet and digital channels. The search to replace Allen was dogged by a string of possible candidates publicly ruling themselves out, prompting speculation and damaging headlines that filling the high-profile role was proving difficult. ITV shares have struggled to make headway so far this year, while the benchmark FTSE 100 index  .FTSE  has gained about 7 percent. Analysts say it could enjoy a reversal in fortunes with Grade's arrival, however. "He knows the TV business inside out," Charles Stanley analyst Tom Gidley Kitchen told Reuters. "Knowing what the BBC is doing is a help, there are no qualifications he doesn't have. "He's been a safe pair of hands (at the BBC) and it's a real coup for ITV. They've got a huge turnaround to do but he has the authority to make changes. He must be far and away the best qualified person to do that job." Grade, who will follow in the footsteps of his uncle Lew Grade, a founder of ITV, was known for his emphasis on ratings when he previously ran publicly owned broadcaster Channel 4. Under the terms of the deal, Grade will succeed current ITV Chairman Peter Burt with a view to staying for three years. Within that time, he will work with the board to appoint a chief executive with Grade then stepping back from day-to-day management, to become non-executive chairman. John Cresswell, the interim Chief Executive Officer will become Chief Operating Officer and Finance Director.
