 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Palm Inc. PALM.O cut its 
second-quarter profit and revenue forecasts on Monday, blaming 
a delay in shipping its new Treo 750 smartphone in the United 
States. 

  The company's shares fell 4.6 percent in extended trading 
following the announcement.  Sunnyvale, California-based Palm now expects to start 
shipping the Treo 750 in the United States early in the fiscal 
third quarter instead of the current quarter when it expected 
the device would help boost sales. Palm's second quarter ends 
on Friday.  It blamed the lower forecasts mainly on a delay by a U.S. 
cellphone carrier in ensuring the Treo 750 is compatible with 
the carrier's network. It declined to name the carrier.  "There are many, many steps and myriad attributes about the 
certification process," Palm spokeswoman Marlene Somsak said. 
"The phones have to be super well-tuned to the network."  Spokespersons for Cingular Wireless and Verizon Wireless, 
two of the largest U.S. cellphone carriers, declined to say 
whether they plan to offer the Treo 750 on their networks.  But Palm said the launch of a version of the device in 
Europe "is doing quite well" and forecast international revenue 
in the second quarter should be strong.  The Treo 750 runs on Microsoft Corp.'s ( MSFT.O ) operating 
system, while another new model, the Treo 680, uses Palm's 
operating system. The Treo 750 has a microprocessor made by 
Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. ( 005930.KS ) while the Treo 680's 
processor is made by Intel Corp. ( INTC.O ), Somsak said. The 
delay does not affect the 680 model, she added.  Palm now expects to report net income for its fiscal second 
quarter of 10 cents to 11 cents per share -- down from an 
earlier forecast of 15 cents to 18 cents per share.  Earnings before certain items are seen at 15 cents to 16 
cents per share, compared with a September forecast of 20 cents 
to 23 cents per share, Palm said. Analysts, on average, were 
expecting earnings per share before items of 22 cents, 
according to Reuters Estimates.  Palm said it expects to report revenue of $390 million to 
$395 million, down from its earlier forecast of $430 million to 
$450 million and below Wall Street's view of $442.3 million.  The company said it expects to report detailed quarterly 
results on December 19.  Palm shares fell to $14.67 in extended trading after being 
as low as $13.90. It ended regular trading on Nasdaq down 3.4 
percent at $15.37, giving it a market value of about $1.6 
billion.
