 LONDON  (Reuters) - A strong dollar is in America's interest, U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said on Tuesday as the greenback continued its slide against major currencies. 

 "A strong dollar is clearly in our nation's interest and I feel very good today about the strength of the U.S. economy," Paulson told reporters traveling with him during a short trip to London. "We have a healthy economy that is making a successful transition from a rate of growth that earlier in the year was not sustainable to one that is sustainable." Earlier, Paulson told a business conference in London the U.S. wanted more foreign exchange flexibility from China.
