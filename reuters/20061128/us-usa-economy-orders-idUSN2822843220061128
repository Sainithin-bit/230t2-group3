 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Government data and a report from a major U.S. manufacturer on Tuesday showed slowing demand for big-ticket equipment, but investors took the news in stride as some said sales growth overseas could offset the domestic slowdown. 

 Orders for durable goods, items meant to last three years or longer, were down 8.3 percent in October, deeper than the 4.6 percent decline forecast by analysts polled by Reuters. A falloff in plane orders contributed to the sharpest drop in those orders since 2000. Diversified manufacturer Emerson Electric Co. ( EMR.N ) told investors that it was racking up new orders at a slower pace over the past three months. "It's just an indication that the manufacturing sector is slowing," said Daniel Meckstroth, chief economist at the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI, an Arlington, Virginia-based trade group. Meckstroth noted the drop followed a stronger-than-expected 7.8 percent rise in September, and said much of the decline reflected the effects of the softening U.S. housing market and troubles at the domestic auto sector. "We're getting these cross-currents, where the housing sector is down, the autos sector is down, the high-tech sector is not growing as rapidly as it was," Meckstroth said. "This sudden change is primarily occurring on the consumer side of the equation." MUTED REACTION Investor reaction to the orders news was muted, with the Standard & Poor's Capital Goods Industry Group Index .GSPIC off just 0.3 percent at midday. That left it up 9.6 percent for the year, behind the 12.6 percent advance in the broader S&P 500 index.  .SPX . One reason for the reaction could be that diversified manufacturers like Emerson, as well as General Electric Co. ( GE.N ), United Technologies Corp. ( UTX.N ) and Honeywell International Inc. ( HON.N ) now generate much of their sales overseas, investors said. GE, selling into rapidly industrializing markets including China and India, expects to book about 45 percent of its projected $163 billion in 2006 revenue abroad. That could offset the domestic slowdown, said Ted Parrish, a principal at Kennesaw, Georgia-based Henssler Financial Group, which manages about $1.2 billion and holds GE stock. He said the slowing durable goods orders would "affect GE's short-cycle businesses, but not their long-cycle businesses." "Their international sales momentum should be enough to offset that," Parrish said. Emerson Electric, a $20.1 billion maker of products ranging from industrial cooling systems to closet organizers, said its order growth rate has slowed. Orders for the three months ended in October were up 5 percent, down from 5 to 10 percent for the three months ended in September. In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the St. Louis-based company noted that 1 percent of its growth in orders during the most recent three-month period was related to favorable currency exchange rates. Not all manufacturers are reporting slowing orders. SPX Corp. ( SPW.N ), a $4.29 billion maker of cooling towers and automotive diagnostic tools, said its orders have held up. "Across all of the markets that we serve ... we continue to see steady demand," Chris Kearney, president and chief executive officer of Charlotte, North Carolina-based SPX told investors. "We're probably seeing longer lead times in our short-cycle businesses than we probably ever have."
