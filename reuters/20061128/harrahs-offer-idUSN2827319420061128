 PHILADELPHIA  Nov 28 (Reuters) - A group led by Penn
National Gaming Inc. ( PENN.O ) and hedge fund D.E. Shaw is
considering making a cash and stock offer for casino company
Harrah's Entertainment Inc. HET.N, a source familiar with the
situation said on Tuesday.  Lehman Brothers LEH.N and Wachovia  Corp. WB.N would
provide financing and have some equity in the company if a deal
went ahead, the source said.  CNBC first reported the news of the possible Penn National
bid. Terms of the potential offer were not immediately
available.  Talk of a new offer for Harrah's comes almost two months
after private equity firms Apollo Management and Texas Pacific
Group offered to buy the casino operator for about $15 billion.
The two firms have since raised their offer to about $15.5
billion.  Penn National, which owns and operates horse-racing parks
and casinos, has a market capitalization of $3.3 billion. That
is a fraction of the $14.2 billion market capitalization of
Harrah's, which owns or manages more than 40 casinos under the
Harrah's, Caesars and Horseshoe brand names.  Harrah's, which has said only that a committee of
non-management directors is reviewing the original bid,
declined comment on Tuesday.  A representative for Penn did not immediately return a call
seeking comment. D.E. Shaw declined comment. Representatives
for Wachovia and Lehman were not immediately available.  Shares of Penn National closed at $38.16, down 58 cents, or
1.5 percent. Shares of Harrah's closed at $78.46, up $1.91 or
2.5 percent.
