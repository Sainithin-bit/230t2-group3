 MOSCOW  (Reuters) - Beverage giant Coca-Cola Co. ( KO.N ) on Tuesday denied market rumors that it plans to buy its largest bottler Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. (CEE) ( CCE.N ). 

 "We have no intention to buy CEE," Coca-Cola Chief Executive Neville Isdell told reporters in Moscow. Earlier in November weekly financial newspaper Barron's quoted an analyst as saying that the probability of the deal was growing.
