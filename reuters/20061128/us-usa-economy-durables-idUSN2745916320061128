 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - New orders for U.S.-made durable goods tumbled a larger-than-expected 8.3 percent in October on a big drop in civilian aircraft, but durable goods orders also fell when transportation was stripped from the total, a government report showed on Tuesday. 

 The biggest drop since July 2000 in orders for durable goods -- big-ticket items expected to last three years or longer -- was propelled by a 21.7 percent fall in transportation orders, the Commerce Department said. But even excluding transportation orders, durables declined 1.7 percent as manufacturing, fabricated metal, and computers and electronics orders all slid. Analysts polled by Reuters were expecting durables orders to drop 4.6 percent overall on a decline in aircraft orders for the month, but to rise 0.2 percent when transportation orders were stripped out. Nondefense aircraft and parts orders fell 44.5 percent in October after a 198.2 percent surge the previous month. When defense orders were excluded, durables orders fell 6.4 percent, well short of the 0.3 percent rise expected by analysts. It was the biggest decline in that category since a matching drop in September 2002. A proxy for business spending, non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, also took an unexpected dive, slipping 5.1 percent. Analysts were anticipating a 0.3 percent rise that category. Unfilled orders for manufactured durable goods have risen 17 of the last 18 months and climbed to the highest level on record in October.
