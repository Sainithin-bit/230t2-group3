 BOSTON  (Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp. ( IBM.N ) said on Tuesday that it agreed to buy privately held software maker Vallent Corp. to boost its line of software offerings. 

 IBM did not disclose financial terms of the deal, which it said it expects to close by the end of the first quarter of 2007. Bellevue, Washington-based Vallent sells software that wireless service providers use to monitor performance of their networks. It has about 200 customers and some 400 employees. IBM of Armonk, New York, is the world's second-largest software maker after Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT.O ).
