 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp. ( XOM.N ) said Tuesday it had not yet decided whether it will appeal a decision by Alaska's natural resources commissioner that could wrest control of a Alaska North Slope oilfield from the company. 

 Exxon spokeswoman Susan Reeves said the company was still reviewing the details of the Monday decision by Alaska Natural Resources Commissioner Mike Menge to declare Exxon in default on development of the Point Thomson field. "This is a major setback for the natural gas pipeline project since the Point Thomson field would supply gas to the pipeline," Reeves said. Menge, in a move supported by departing Alaska Gov. Frank Murkowski, said on Monday the latest development plan submitted by Exxon for the 106,000-acre field did not commit the company to pumping oil or gas from Point Thomson, according to the Anchorage Daily News. Exxon has 30 days to appeal the default ruling to the Alaska Superior Court. Critics have long charged Exxon with "warehousing" the Point Thomson field since 1977. The critics claim Alaska is losing out on tax income for as long as the field remains undeveloped. Reeves said Exxon has complied with all of the agreements it has with Alaska on Point Thomson as well as all government regulations. "Exxon is disappointed the state did not agree to the modified plan for development," Reeves said. Incoming Gov. Sarah Palin praised Murkowski's administration for the action, according to Anchorage paper. Point Thomson holds about a quarter of the North Slope's total known reserves of 35 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and an estimated 300 million barrels of oil, the Daily News reported. Menge's action does not terminate Exxon's leases immediately, but if upheld, the leases could eventually be voided and offered for sale. Exxon would be eligible to bid, if it loses any appeal.
