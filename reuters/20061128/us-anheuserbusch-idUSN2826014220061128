 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc. ( BUD.N ) said on Tuesday it expects its international beer operations to post lower profit this year, hurt by a U.K. shift in sales from bars and restaurants to less profitable sales through retailers. 

 The company had previously forecast flat profit from its international business. Still, the largest U.S. beer brewer stood by other financial forecasts for the year and its long-term earnings target and its stock rose 1.2 percent, rebounding somewhat from a steady decline earlier in the month. At a meeting with analysts on Tuesday, Anheuser-Busch also said it planned a significant increase in share repurchases in 2007, after pension contributions cut into cash available for repurchases in 2006. The company said it would spend more on marketing in 2007 to try to boost beer sales volume. The company also plans to add more sales representatives in urban markets in 2007 to help promote its products, especially smaller craft beers, as well as imports, categories which are popular in many U.S. cities. In the past year, the company bought Rolling Rock brands from Belgium's InBev INTB.BR for $82 million and also reached a deal to be the exclusive importer and distributor of Grolsch NV's GROLc.AS beers as of 2007. Anheuser-Busch, whose Bud Light is the top-selling brand in the United States, controls about half the domestic beer market. But its dominance is being challenged by imported light beers such as Heineken Premium Light and Corona Light. The U.S. beer market overall has also been hurt by consumers buying more spirits instead of beer. All those factors could make it difficult for the company to make planned price increases stick next year, said Charles Norton, portfolio manager of the Vice Fund, which owned 15,000 Anheuser-Busch shares as of October 31. "I think it's going to be tough, just because that market is so competitive between Bud and Miller and Coors and where consumers are choosing beer, they are going for an import or craft beers," Norton said. Aside from expectations that international profits would be somewhat lower, the company stood by its forecast for key financial measures for the year, including a 1.3 percent to 1.7 percent increase in revenue per barrel and a cost of goods sold per barrel up just less than 3 percent. The company also stood by its long-term target of 7 percent to 10 percent earnings per share growth. Anheuser-Busch also told investors it expects growth in revenue per barrel to be slightly higher in 2007. The company said lower energy prices should help costs increase less in 2007 than in 2006. Last month the St. Louis, Missouri-based company posted better-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by price increases instituted in some markets over the summer. The company, which last year cut prices amid sluggish growth in the United States, said last month that it plans to raise prices again on most of the beer it sells early next year. Anheuser-Busch shares rose 55 cents to $46.69 on Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange. Before Tuesday's gain, the stock traded at about 16 times estimated 2007 earnings, above fellow brewer Molson Coors Brewing Co.'s ( TAP.N ) 14.6 multiple but below that of spirits company Brown-Forman Corp. ( BFa.N ), which had a multiple of 19.7. (Additional reporting by  Martinne Geller )
