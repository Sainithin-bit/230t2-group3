 LONDON  (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said on Tuesday trade protectionism was on the rise despite strong global prosperity and warned it was a potentially dangerous trend. 

 "We cannot allow protectionist elements to stifle our growth, limit our opportunities, and dictate the terms of our engagement with the world," Paulson said in prepared remarks for delivery to the Confederation of British Industry's annual conference. "Giving in to protectionist sentiment would send a terrible signal," Paulson said during a joint appearance with British Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown. The U.S. Treasury chief, who was in London on a quick one-day stop, said that developed nations must beware of sending a signal that they were unwilling to help poorer countries develop their economies. Paulson, who recently authored a joint appeal with Brown to restart the Doha round of free-trade talks, said achieving a successful outcome remained the United States' top trade priority. He said U.S. elections earlier this month which resulted in Democrat-controlled U.S. House of Representatives and Senate made no difference to the U.S. commitment toward reopening the Doha trade talks. The Doha talks broke down in July, primarily due to differences over farm trade. Paulson said while reducing agricultural subsidies was important, it was just as vital to find ways to boost trade in manufacturing and services. Paulson said countries that opened their borders to trade almost invariably achieved increased prosperity. "Despite the known benefits of trade, the protectionist sentiment that is rising in our two nations and elsewhere around the world is predicated on a false assumption that trade harms our economies," Paulson said.
