 ROCHESTER, New York  (Reuters) - U.S. inflation looks set to remain high and interest rates may not be high enough to quell it, Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Plosser said on Tuesday. 

 While lower energy prices have curbed consumer price rises since the Fed stopped raising rates in August, the pace of U.S. economic expansion slowed sharply in the third quarter. But the level of core prices -- which exclude volatile food and energy components -- remains a concern for policy-makers. "There is a significant possibility that inflation rates will remain above those consistent with price stability for some time," Plosser said in a speech at a seminar here. The core inflation rate, measured by the core personal consumption expenditures index, was likely to remain above 2 percent "through at least 2007," which was higher than Plosser's view of price stability. As a result, he said the Fed would have to remain vigilant about those risks. "There remains some risk that policy is not yet firm enough to ensure a return to price stability over a reasonable time horizon," Plosser he said. "We need to remain vigilant and recognize that maintaining the current stance of policy, or even firming further, may be in the best interests of the economy's long-run performance," he added. Plosser's remarks on monetary policy were largely in line with views expressed in his first policy speech in early October. The U.S. Treasuries market largely brushed off his comments, as bond prices rose on weak economic data and strong demand for new two-year debt supply. The Fed in August halted a two-year-long campaign to raise rates gradually, leaving its key overnight federal funds rate target steady at 5.25 percent at its two subsequent meetings while warning it remains on high alert over inflation. The market consensus is for the Fed to hold rates steady again at its next policy meeting on December 12 and many market participants expect the Fed to begin easing policy sometime next year. MARKET EXPECTATIONS Asked about market expectations for a rate cut, Plosser later said: "Markets are going to do what they will do ... I'm not too worried about that," reiterating the Fed would take steps to keep inflation in check. While inflation readings in the past few months looked more encouraging, "we should not read too much into these figures" because the recent rise in headline figures were mainly due to an increase in oil prices, he said. Plosser assumed his post in August and is not a voting member on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee this year. He will have his first vote in 2008. The Philly Fed president said the U.S. economy was "in pretty good shape" despite recent slowing and growth will return near trend next year. Any fallout on consumer spending from a housing slump would be limited because declines in house prices were largely being offset by a strong stock market and strong income growth. Plosser said he, along with others, had downgraded his view on growth, which he now sees at close to 3 percent rather than 3.5 percent. "When I say that growth should return to trend in 2007, I am expecting that growth will be near 3 percent," he said. "Note that this means that it should not surprise or concern us to see growth slowing from its pace of the last few years." Asked later about the China's massive U.S. Treasury holdings, Plosser said: "I don't see this as a major financial crisis or an issue". There have been some calls within China to shift some of the country's reserves, the world's largest at more than $1 trillion, away from dollar assets. A decline in the dollar, which has accelerated since last  week, could potentially erode the value of such holdings. On global imbalances and the U.S. current account deficit, Plosser said: "I don't believe the decline in the dollar will have a big effect on inflation." U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said in London on Tuesday that there had been a fair amount of tension between Beijing and Washington over economic policy and that the United States needs greater foreign exchange flexibility from China. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke will accompany Paulson and other Cabinet officials to Beijing in mid-December.
