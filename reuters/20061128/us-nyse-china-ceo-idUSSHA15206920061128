 SHANGHAI  (Reuters) - NYSE Group Inc. NYX.N Chief Executive John Thain said on Tuesday he was confident that shareholders of pan-European bourse Euronext ENXT.PA would approve its planned merger with the New York Stock Exchange. 

 "Yes, I'm confident," Thain told reporters at the CEIBS business school in Shanghai, his first stop during a four-day China trip. Thain added that he believed European regulators would approve the merger soon after shareholders of both companies voted for it. Last week, Paris-based Euronext said it would ask its shareholders to vote on a proposed merger with NYSE Group, parent company of the New York Stock Exchange. An extraordinary shareholder meeting for the vote will be held on December 19. Euronext in June accepted a $10 billion takeover proposal by NYSE, a deal which both firms say is a merger of equals.
