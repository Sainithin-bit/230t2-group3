 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Motorola Inc. MOT.N said on Monday 
that a Florida court declared a mistrial in a $10-billion 
misappropriation case brought against it by SPS Technologies 
Corp. as the jury could not agree on a verdict. 

  SPS, a now-defunct Florida company, had accused Motorola, 
the world's No. 2 cell phone maker, of misappropriating trade 
secrets related to a vehicle-tracking technology system, 
according to Motorola.  Motorola lawyer George Selby said Motorola had discussed 
forming a venture with SPS and other companies in 2000 related 
to the vehicle-tracking system, but that the venture was never 
consummated because it did not make business sense.  Broward County Florida Circuit Court Judge Leroy Moe 
declared a mistrial after the jury became deadlocked on the 
question of whether Motorola had misappropriated trade secrets, 
Selby said.  He said Motorola tried to come to a settlement with SPS. 
Reuters was not able to reach representatives for SPS.
