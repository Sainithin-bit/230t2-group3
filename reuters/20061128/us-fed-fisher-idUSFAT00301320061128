 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Lower oil prices and a U.S. commercial property boom will help offset the serious problem of a cooling housing market, Dallas Federal Reserve President Richard Fisher said in an interview published on Tuesday. 

 German financial daily Handelsblatt also quoted Fisher as saying he was personally satisfied with current U.S. interest rates of 5.25 percent and thought they were about right. But it was better to err on the upside than the downside. "If I am wrong, then better to go in the direction of combating inflation because of the great damage that it causes," he told the newspaper. The interview was conducted last week during a visit to Germany. Handelsblatt said Fisher, who is not a member of the Federal Reserve's rate-setting committee this year, described the downturn in the housing market as a "very serious problem" which had been exacerbated by keeping rates too low for too long. But he thought the U.S. economy would rebound in the fourth quarter from the slow annual growth of 1.6 percent in the third quarter, the paper said. "There are counterforces (to the housing downturn) like the lower oil prices and the boom in commercial property," Fisher said. Handelsblatt quoted Fisher as saying lower energy prices also meant companies were talking less about passing higher costs on to consumers, and inflation pressures were lower than they were six months ago. The Fed halted a two-year campaign of tightening credit costs in August and has kept rates on hold amid a slowing in the housing market, which had fueled rapid consumer spending. A Reuters poll of 60 economists last week found the median expectation was for the Fed to cut benchmark rates to 5.0 percent by mid-2007, even though the housing slowdown may be nearing a trough. The Fed was also trying to gauge how long it would take for past interest rate rises to fully impact on the economy, Fisher said.
