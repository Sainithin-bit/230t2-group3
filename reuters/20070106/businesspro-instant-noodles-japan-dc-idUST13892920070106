 TOKYO  (Reuters) - The Japanese inventor of instant noodles, 
a snack that has sold billions of servings worldwide since its 
launch, died on Friday at the age of 96, according to an 
official at Nissin Food Products Co. ( 2897.T ), the company he 
founded. 

  Born in Taiwan in 1910 while it was under Japanese 
occupation, Momofuku Ando ran clothing and other companies in 
Taipei and Osaka early in his career.  He was inspired to develop the world's first instant noodle 
product after coming across a long line of people waiting to 
buy fresh "ramen" noodles from a black market stall during the 
food shortages after World War Two, Japanese media said.  After his Chicken Ramen product became hugely popular in 
1958, despite a luxury price-tag of 35 yen, he went on to bring 
out the Cup Noodle in 1971.  Providing the instant noodles in a waterproof styrofoam 
container that could be used to cook them using just hot water 
proved a stroke of marketing genius that made the product a hit 
with time-pressed people around the world.  Ando remained in the public eye until recently -- appearing 
on television in 2005 to promote a version of the Cup Noodle 
adapted for astronauts to eat aboard the space shuttle 
Discovery.  Often seen devouring servings of the dish he invented, Ando 
opened a museum devoted to instant noodles in Osaka in 1999. 
Ando is survived by his wife, Masako.
