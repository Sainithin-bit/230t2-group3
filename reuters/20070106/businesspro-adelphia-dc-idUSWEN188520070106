 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Adelphia Communications Corp. 
ADELQ.PK said on Friday that a U.S. court had confirmed its 
bankruptcy reorganization plan, paving the way for a 
transaction that will make cable operator Time Warner Cable a 
public company. 

  Adelphia is partially using a 16 percent stake in Time 
Warner Cable worth nearly $6 billion to pay its creditors as 
part of a 2005 deal for Adelphia's cable assets.  Once the shares are distributed, Time Warner is expected to 
register them with the New York Stock Exchange, a move analysts 
expect will lead to its becoming a publicly traded company by 
the end of January.  Judge Robert Gerber approved Adelphia's bankruptcy plan on 
Wednesday at the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of 
New York, after four and a half years of wrangling with 
creditors and several amended plans.  On Friday, Adelphia said the court had entered its 
confirmation order and that it expects the reorganization plan 
to become effective on January 17, unless an additional stay is 
granted by an appellate court.  Adelphia began bankruptcy proceedings in 2002 after one of 
the largest accounting scandals in U.S. corporate history. It 
was the fifth-largest U.S. cable operator with about 5 million 
subscribers.  Time Warner Cable is part of media company Time Warner Inc 
( TWX.N ).  (Additional reporting by  Scott Hillis  in San Francisco)
