 MUMBAI  (Reuters) - The Bombay Stock Exchange Ltd. (BSE) has 
shortlisted London, Nasdaq, Deutsche Borse, New York and 
Singapore stock exchanges for the proposed sale of a 26 percent 
stake, the Business Standard newspaper reported on Saturday. 

  The newspaper, quoting sources, said that at its board 
meeting on Friday the exchange also decided to privately place 
some equity with domestic institutions, and banks which do not 
have their own broking outfits.  When contacted, BSE Managing Director and Chief Executive 
Officer Rajnikant Patel declined comment.  "There has been speculation on this ever since the plan for 
a stake sale was first mooted. It would not be right for me to 
make any comments at this point," he told Reuters.  The paper said that the exchange would be offering the 
stake to a maximum of three strategic investors.  Last month the Reserve Bank of India had said that foreign 
investment of up to 49 percent would be allowed in stock 
exchanges, depositories and clearing corporations. This would 
include a foreign direct investment of 26 percent and 23 
percent sold to foreign institutional investors.  Markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India 
had said in November last year "that no person shall, directly 
or indirectly, acquire or hold more than five per cent in the 
paid up equity capital of a recognized stock exchange."  BSE has set itself a deadline of May 2007 to reduce the 
stake held by brokers by offering 26 percent to strategic 
investors and another 25 percent through an initial public 
offering.
