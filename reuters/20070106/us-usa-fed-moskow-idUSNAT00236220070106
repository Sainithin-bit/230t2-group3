 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Chicago Federal Reserve President Michael Moskow on Friday said monthly jobs growth, recently averaging about 160,000 per month, was solid given current evolutionary trends in the overall U.S. labor market. 

 "By the old standard, that would be just average but given the current trends in the labor force, we view such growth as quite solid," Moskow said in a speech to the Labor and Employment Relations Association annual meeting. Moskow repeated a previous comment that falling labor force participation, partly reflecting an aging population, makes a number of about 100,000 per month an appropriate level for sustainable jobs growth, down from 150,000 during the 1990s and early 2000s. This change "has important implications for our view of recent labor market conditions," he said. The Labor Department said earlier on Friday that U.S. employers added 167,000 workers to their payrolls last month, an unexpectedly strong jobs creation figure that had financial markets reassessing the outlook for interest-rate policy. Moskow, a voting member of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee this year, did not address the current economy in his remarks, which were focused on ways in which changing labor trends can impact policy. "Monetary policy could go off track if we don't recognize the impact of such structural changes on the economy, and the benchmarks we use to evaluate the incoming data," he said. Moskow warned that trends such as a slower pace of work force growth "imply slower growth in potential output" compared with the heyday of the baby boom generation. An evolution in hiring practices -- including a more efficient job-search process, a shift to just-in-time hiring and greater use of temporary staff -- have helped pull down the natural jobless rate, Moskow said. The natural rate of unemployment, the level below which wage inflation pressures start to build, was once seen at 6 percent, but is now pegged by most economists near 5 percent. The current U.S. jobless rate is 4.5 percent. "If wages rise faster than productivity for a prolonged period, the resulting persistent increases in unit labor costs can fuel inflation," Moskow said. Still, Moskow said the shift to more variable, performance-based pay can both reduce wage rigidity and enhance economic performance. "This may lessen inflation persistence by reducing the tendency for current wage increases to become locked into firms' labor costs," he said.
