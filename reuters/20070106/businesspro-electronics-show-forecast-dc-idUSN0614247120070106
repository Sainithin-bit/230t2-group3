 LAS VEGAS  (Reuters) - U.S. consumer electronics sales are 
expected to hit a record $155 billion in 2007, fueled by 
consumers' fascination with video games, digital music, and 
flat-screen displays, an industry group said on Saturday. 

  Wholesale sales of consumer electronics -- including 
everything from iPods and audio cables to mobile phones and 
personal computers -- will grow about 8 percent, up from $145 
billion in 2006, when sales climbed 13 percent, the Consumer 
Electronics Association said in its annual report on the eve of 
the 2007 Consumer Electronics Show.  Big-screen televisions will continue be the star in the 
market, CEA said, as consumers take advantage of falling prices 
to upgrade to plasma and LCD TVs. CEA said display technologies 
will account for $26 billion in revenues for 2007, when some 19 
million of those two types of flat panel TVs will ship.  "The TV market is setting all-time revenue records," said 
Todd Thibodeaux, a vice president at CEA. "(Traditional) 
CRT-based sets are giving way to flat panel displays. The 
successful ongoing transition to digital television is driving 
demand."  Consumer electronics makers have benefited from the rapid 
change to digital media, a technological step that made it 
simpler to move audio and video to myriad devices. A rise to 
$150 billion would represent a 50 percent increase from 2003, 
when the flat panel market was still in its infancy and overall 
growth was limited by a decline in stand-alone audio products.  Those stand-alone devices, such as CD players and cassette 
tape decks, were nudged aside in the advent of digital music 
players, such as Apple Computer Inc.'s ( AAPL.O ) top-selling 
iPod and competing models by Sandisk Corp. ( SNDK.O ), Microsoft 
Corp. ( MSFT.O ) and others.  Pocket-sized digital music players, many of which also can 
display snapshots, movies or TV shows, will remain in high 
demand in 2007, CEA said, noting that 41 million MP3 players 
are expected to ship in 2007, up from 34 million in 2006.  "It continues to ship at large volumes and 2007 will be no 
different as the market shifts into a replacement mode," said 
Thibodeaux. "Many consumers will be replacing their 
first-generation players with new players offering video 
playback capability."  Next generation video game consoles, digital cameras, 
personal computers, portable navigation and global positioning 
system (GPS) devices, are among the other products expected to 
sell well in 2007, CEA said.  The Consumer Electronics Association's estimates cover 
factory-to-dealer shipments, or wholesale figures. While the 
2007 growth outlook represents a slowdown from last year, CEA 
noted that its original projection for 2006 was 8 percent.  "Consumers started the year investing in innovative 
consumer electronics products and seemingly never stopped," 
said Thibodeaux of CEA. "With the 2007 forecast, we see the 
consumer love affair with technology continuing at a healthy 
clip."
