 LONDON  (Reuters) - British Airways Plc BAY.L has reached 
an agreement with its four main trade unions on a package of 
reforms to tackle its 2.1 billion pound ($4.1 billion) pension 
deficit, the airline confirmed on Saturday. 

  The deal, struck late on Friday, will be recommended by the 
unions to the workforce to end months of negotiations and 
should lift the threat of industrial action at the airline.  BA has agreed to make a one-off contribution of 800 million 
pounds into the pension fund subject to acceptance of benefit 
changes.  The airline said together with a one-off employee saving of 
400 million pounds and changes to future benefits, the New 
Airways Pension Scheme (NAPS) pension deficit will be reduced 
by more than half to 900 million pounds.  Its annual contributions will be around 280 million pounds 
for the next decade.  "Together with the NAPS trustees and staff, we have found a 
shared solution that helps secure the pensions of our 33,500 
NAPS members and removes a major blocker to future investment 
in British Airways," BA Chief Executive Willie Walsh said in an 
emailed statement.  "This brings the NAPS deficit and ongoing contributions to 
a level which is affordable by British Airways and effectively 
tackles one of the most fundamental issues we face," Walsh 
said.  Further details of the proposed pension arrangements will 
be released following communications to employees on Monday, BA 
said.  It agreed a funding plan to clear the NAPS deficit with the 
pension scheme trustees in 2006, subject to members accepting 
changes to future benefits.  BA said in November it had agreed to make a one-off 
injection of 800 million pounds and pay up to 50 million pounds 
a year for three years to tackle its pension deficit, but still 
had to negotiate the deal with unions.  The airline last year proposed raising the retirement age 
of its 2,500 pilots to 60 from 55 and raise the retirement age 
for other staff to 65.
