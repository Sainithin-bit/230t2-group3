 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Tellabs Inc.( TLAB.O ), which makes equipment for telecommunications networks, cut its forecast for fourth quarter revenue on Friday, citing uncertainty in North America concerning the effect of industry consolidation. 

 Tellabs said it expected fourth-quarter revenue of $455 million to $470 million, with net income per share of 5 cents to 7 cents. Earnings excluding special items are expected to be 10 cents to 12 cents per share. That falls short of the company's previous forecast of revenue at $525 million to $550 million and compares with the average of analysts' estimates of $534 million, as compiled by Reuters Estimates. Analysts had also expected earnings per share of 14 cents, before special items. The company said its preliminary estimates were driven by lower-than-expected revenue from some large North American customers, an unfavorable shift in product mix, revenue deferrals related to a new product launch, and a lower effective tax. "Uncertainty surrounding telecom industry consolidation led to lower than expected revenue in North America," Tellabs Chief Executive Krish Prabhu said. But the company expects the factors hampering revenue would be temporary and that it will continue to see growing demand for equipment that enables high-speed Internet connections. Some of the largest U.S. telecoms providers have merged their businesses to better offer new services and compete with the voice, video and data provided by cable or Internet operators. The consolidation has prompted some of their equipment suppliers into an acquisition mode to gain greater negotiating clout, while putting pressure on others regarding pricing and the timing of orders. Last month, No. 1 U.S. telecoms company AT&T Inc. ( T.N ) closed its $86 billion purchase of local carrier BellSouth Corp.
