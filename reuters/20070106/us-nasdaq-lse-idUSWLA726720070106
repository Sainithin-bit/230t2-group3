 LONDON  (Reuters) - Nasdaq Stock Market Inc ( NDAQ.O ) said it had made no decision about what it would do with its 28.75 percent stake in London Stock Exchange Group Plc ( LSE.L ) if its hostile bid for the UK company falls through. 

 "No decisions have been made about its (Nasdaq's) strategy for its LSE shares in the event of a lapsed bid," Nasdaq said in a statement on Friday. "Nasdaq's options include selling all or a portion of its stake and/or competing directly in the London market (either on its own or in co-operation with another party)," it added. January 27 is the last date that either side can announce any new information on the bid situation, while February 10 is the final date for acceptances by shareholders. Last month, the LSE urged shareholders to reject the 2.7 billion pound ($5.3 billion) hostile bid from the largest U.S. electronic stock market, saying it substantially undervalued the company in relation to its peers. Although UK takeover rules prevent Nasdaq revising its offer unless a rival bid is tabled or LSE management performs a u-turn and recommends the bid, Nasdaq also sought to play down media speculation that it might be prepared to up its offer. "No comments attributed to it with respect to an increase in its offers should be interpreted as indicative of Nasdaq's intentions. Nasdaq's position remains as set out in the announcement on November 20, 2006," the U.S. exchange said. On that date, Nasdaq made its second offer since March for the LSE, saying it would pay 1,243 per share in cash for the rest of the exchange. LSE shares closed at 1,283p on Friday, down 4 pence or 0.3 percent.
