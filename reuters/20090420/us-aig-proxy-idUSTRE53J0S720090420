 (Reuters) - American International Group Inc ( AIG.N ) has delayed filing its annual proxy statement as it weighs a potential reshuffle of its board, the Wall Street Journal said, citing a person familiar with the matter. 

 The insurer would like to expand and reshuffle its 11-member board, the person told the paper. "We are in ongoing discussions regarding several issues and as a result have not yet filed our proxy statement," the paper cited AIG as saying in a statement. "We intend to reschedule our annual meeting and will announce the new date in due course." AIG could not be immediately reached for comment by Reuters.
