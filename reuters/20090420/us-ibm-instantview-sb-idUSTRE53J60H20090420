 NEW YORK/BOSTON  (Reuters) - IBM reported a bigger-than-expected fall in quarterly sales, showing that even one of the healthier U.S. technology companies is getting hurt by a slowdown in corporate spending. 

 Shares in the firm slid more than 3 percent in after-hours trade. COMMENTARY: JAMES BREHM, ANALYST, FROST & SULLIVAN "One of the things that stands out when I look at IBM's announcement were the 16 services deals greater than $100 million. Services is really bringing those guys along...I think it's a better day to be at IBM than it is at Oracle." TIM GHRISKEY, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, SOLARIS ASSET MANAGEMENT "It's good. I was wondering why the market was starting to rally, now I see why. Ahead of pace for 2010 roadmap of $10 to $11 per share. This is a very good quarter, well above expectations. "Not quite sure where the light revenues are coming from, but I'd say that's a secondary issue, especially since they reaffirmed guidance above the consensus. The market in the after-hours is reacting very positively to it. Their long term outlook is very good. "The consensus for 2010, which admittedly is very far out, is $9.78 and they are going to do $10 to $11. Revenues were impacted by a strong dollar. Understandable, certainly explainable...but it's going to take a while to verify that. "Tax rate did help some, it was a full percentage point less than last year in the first quarter. Over $12 billion in cash on hand, this is a company that can do a major acquisition. Strong free cash flow, strong balance sheet. So this is a very good quarter and it should certainly help the markets tomorrow." ZACH ROSENSTOCK, ANALYST, WAYNE HUMMER WEALTH MANAGEMENT "It looks like people aren't too happy with what they are seeing. For me the thing that's upsetting is revenues, down 11 percent. "It's echoing some of the things we've seen from other companies, saying revenues aren't that good but earnings are really strong. "They reiterated guidance...but people really want to see the revenues pick up. For a while, (better-than-expected earnings) was driven by top-line growth, now you are getting it from profit margins or adjustments here and there." PETER MISEK, ANALYST, CANACCORD ADAMS "It's kind of as expected. They beat on EPS. They reiterated on guidance. I didn't expect them to miss on revenue by that much, which is probably why the stock is trading off. "Short-term bookings look a little weaker than everybody had hoped. That probably means that the next quarter will be mixed. The long-term guide looks solid." (Reporting by  Jim Finkle ,  Bill Rigby  and  Gabriel Madway , Compiled by Edwin Chan)
