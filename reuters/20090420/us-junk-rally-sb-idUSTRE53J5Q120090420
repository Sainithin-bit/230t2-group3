 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. junk bonds are posting their best start to a year since 1991 as hopes that the worst of a global financial crisis may be over entice investors back into riskier bonds. 

 Boosted by a 7.1 percent gain in April to date, junk bonds have posted a 12.5 percent year-to-date total return, by far the best performance of any major category of U.S. bonds, according to Merrill Lynch data. Though signs of economic recovery remain tentative at best, hopes that the slump is at least leveling off have bolstered demand for junk bonds, helping them recover from their worst performance on record in 2008. "Investors are looking at a somewhat less risky landscape than certainly they were at the end of 2008," said Christopher Garman, founder of Garman Research in Orinda, California. Junk, or high-yield bonds, which are rated below investment grade, usually post their best gains after a market meltdown as investors snap up deeply discounted bonds in anticipation of a recovery. In 1991, a year after the bankruptcy of junk bond powerhouse Drexel Burnham Lambert, high-yield bonds clawed their way back to a 39 percent gain. ECONOMIC WORRIES LINGER Some strategists are skeptical that the market is on a similar winning streak, however. "We think the market has gotten ahead of itself," said Kingman Penniman, president of high-yield research firm KDP Investment Advisors. "Even if we hit bottom, we're not going to get a major bounce economically." While some investors remain cautious on junk bonds, cash has returned to the market since December when the Federal Reserve slashed benchmark U.S. interest rates to as low as zero, encouraging investors into risky assets in a search for yield. The trend accelerated when economic data began to look less dire, adding fuel to a stock rally, especially in many small-cap companies that issue junk bonds. "When the Fed cut rates to zero and basically said that they would do whatever it took to get money flowing again, that was the point in our view that the Armageddon scenario was pretty well off the table," said Garman. Fears of a financial system meltdown triggered a 26 percent loss in junk bonds last year, pushing average yields to a record 22.7 percent. At those yields, the market was priced for a Depression-like scenario, leaving room for gains even if the economy remained weak. "Even though the economy and fundamentals are really very poor, it hasn't been as problematic as some people might have thought, myself included," said Citigroup high-yield strategist John Fenn. INSTITUTIONS STILL SIDELINED Though defaults are rising, the market impact has been relatively small because most bonds defaulting this year were already trading at steep discounts. "There really wasn't lot of downside associated with any particular default," Fenn said. High-yield bonds could still suffer a sell-off, even a nasty one, but over the next two years, their returns should be quite good, said Martin Fridson, chief executive officer of Fridson Investment Advisors. "You have a lot of institutional money still on the sidelines, and that creates tremendous upside," Fridson said. "The big institutional funds that are earmarked for investment in this category have not come in in any major way yet." Small investors have not been reticent. Over the past month alone, individual investors have pumped $4 billion into high-yield mutual funds, according to AMG Data Services. The cash is helping fuel a resurgence in high-yield bond issuance, which has topped $5.4 billion month to date, more than double the $2.3 billion sold in all of March, according to KDP Investment Advisors. Though it may be difficult to call the market bottom, "I think people are probably wrong to put too much emphasis on timing," Fridson said. Given that the current yield on the high-yield market is still more than 12.5 percent, "you're getting paid pretty well in terms of current income while you're waiting," he said.
