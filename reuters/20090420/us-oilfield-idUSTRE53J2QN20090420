 NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Oilfield services company Halliburton Co ( HAL.N ) posted a drop in quarterly profit on Monday and gave a weak outlook as energy companies cut spending, though the profit topped forecasts and its shares rose. 

 U.S. natural gas prices have sunk to a more than six-year low recently, and crude oil prices are down by two-thirds from their highs last year, prompting energy companies to scrap some projects and slow spending on others. "There can be no certainty on when the decline in activity will bottom out," Halliburton Chief Executive Dave Lesar told analysts on a conference call. "This downturn so far is worse than previous cycles in terms of the speed of the decline." He said both U.S. and international margins would probably continue to weaken. Smaller peer Weatherford International Ltd ( WFT.N ) also saw its profits sink from a year earlier, even though revenue climbed as its Latin American business nearly doubled. Low energy prices have led to the idling of about one-third of the U.S. rigs drilling for gas and oil in the past year, and analysts expect more to stop working in the coming weeks as gas prices remain low. But analysts at Barclays Capital said Halliburton's North American results were not as bad as expected. "They did not decline as much as we thought in the collapsing rig count environment in the first quarter," Barclays said in a note to investors. "The company's willingness to discount aggressively and packaging of product lines contributed to this." Shares of Halliburton were up 2 percent in afternoon trading at $19.15, while Weatherford shares were 3.4 percent lower at $14.25, recovering from an early 8 percent drop. Weatherford Chief Executive Bernard Duroc-Danner said on a conference call he sees margins bottoming out this quarter or next, making the second half of 2009 look relatively better. The company, which completed its redomestication to Switzerland in February, now plans to spend $1.4 billion on capital expenditure, or $200 million more than previously planned. About 85 percent of the total is outside North America, where it has been permanently reducing its presence. EARNINGS HIT Halliburton's first-quarter net profit fell to $378 million, or 42 cents per share, from $575 million, or 64 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue fell 3 percent to $3.9 billion. Excluding a $28 million charge for cutting jobs, the second-largest oilfield services company behind Schlumberger Ltd ( SLB.N ) earned 44 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates, topping analysts' average forecast of 41 cents. Schlumberger is due to report earnings on Friday. Last week, Nigeria's justice minister said he would prosecute any state officials found to have taken bribes from Halliburton's KBR ( KBR.N ) unit, which has been split off into a separate company. KBR pleaded guilty in February to charges that it paid $180 million in bribes in the country to obtain rights to build an energy facility. Weatherford's first-quarter earnings fell to $165 million, or 23 cents a share, from $264 million, or 38 cents per share. Excluding a charge from an investigation, costs to exit sanctioned countries and job cuts, Weatherford's profit of 27 cents a share fell short of the average forecast of 29 cents. A boost in Weatherford's Mexico contracts helped lift its revenue by 3 percent to $2.26 billion in the quarter.
