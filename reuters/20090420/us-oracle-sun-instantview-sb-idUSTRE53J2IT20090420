 (Adds additional comment) 

 NEW YORK, April 20  (Reuters) - Business software maker Oracle Corp on Monday offered to pay more than $7 billion to acquire Sun Microsystems Inc in a surprise offer that came two weeks after the collapse of takeover talks between Sun and International Business Machines Corp. The Oracle offer of $9.50 a share in cash was at a 42 percent premium to the high-end server maker's closing stock price on Friday. The following is reaction from industry analysts and investors: ROBERT JAKOBSEN, JYSKE, COPENHAGEN, DENMARK "I'm initially a little bit surprised. It could make sense. "The deal would strengthen Oracle's position against IBM. Oracle has done a good job on acquisitions it has done earlier." "It makes sense also historically, Oracle has been more succesful commercializing software than Sun." DAVE ROVELLI, MANAGING DIRECTOR, US EQUITY TRADING CANACCORD ADAMS, NEW YORK "Right now the markets are more focused on what happened with Bank of America, but obviously its good to have mergers. Its show there are companies out there looking for a good investment. "The market is not going to trade up off this. Its more concerned with the Bank of America earnings and Goldman Sachs reiterated its sell rating on Citi with $1.50 price target. "It's definitely a positive but tech is up so much, it's the number one sector besides financial in this rally. The semiconductor index from November 21 to this week is up 58 percent of its lows. I don't think you should look at it as a negative if it doesn't give it a lift, futures are down (S&P 500) 12 points which is a pretty big move. Put it this way if the market's down at the open, if tech's down, it wont be as down as much as it would have been." (Reporting by Ed Krudy in New York and  Tarmo Virki  in Helsinki)
