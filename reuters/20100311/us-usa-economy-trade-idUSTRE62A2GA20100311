 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit narrowed unexpectedly in January as oil imports fell to their lowest since February 1999, a government report showed on Thursday. 

 The trade gap shrank 6.6 percent to $37.3 billion, the Commerce Department said. U.S. exports declined, but not as much as the oil-led drop in imports. Analysts had expected the deficit to widen to $41.0 billion from $39.9 billion in December, which was revised down from a previously reported $40.2 billion. Average prices for imported oil hit $73.89 per barrel, the highest since October 2008, while the quantity of imported crude oil fell to an 11-year low.
