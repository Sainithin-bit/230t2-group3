 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Northrop Grumman Corp's ( NOC.N ) decision not to bid in a multibillion-dollar U.S. aerial tanker competition was a setback for the ambitions of its partner, EADS ( EAD.PA ), but the European company still hopes to boost U.S. revenue to $10 billion by 2020. 

 "This in no way diminishes our interest in the U.S. market," EADS North America Chief Executive Sean O'Keefe told Reuters on Thursday. EADS is continuing to look for mid-sized acquisitions, especially in the defense services industry, and will compete aggressively for new U.S. contracts, including much-needed replacement of aging Coast Guard aircraft, O'Keefe said. Examples include the Army's armed helicopter program, expected to be worth between $5 billion to $6 billion for 350 helicopters. EADS would be the prime contractor, under its proposal, teamed with Lockheed Martin Corp ( LMT.N ). O'Keefe, a former Navy secretary hired in October to help EADS expand its U.S. footprint, expects services to account for at least 25 percent of its U.S. revenue, which reached nearly $1.4 billion last year excluding Airbus. He said EADS had already dramatically increased its standing with the U.S. military by winning the last tanker competition with Northrop, and through its successful work on the Army's UH-72 helicopters, as well as programs for the Coast Guard, Navy, National Guard and U.S. Border Patrol. These days, U.S. military officials think of EADS as "real players," O'Keefe said. "That's quite an accomplishment. It's not just a leap of faith that we could do something because we say we can. We have demonstrated a capability to do so and perform on contracts." The Pentagon canceled the 2008 tanker deal with Northrop and EADS after government auditors upheld a Boeing Co ( BA.N ) protest. EADS' hopes of winning the contract again were dashed on Monday when Northrop said the team would not submit a bid. Paul Nisbet of JSA Research said EADS could face an uphill battle with its expansion plans, given less-than-rosy forecasts for U.S. defense spending, losses linked to the delayed A400M transport plane, and possible future issues with its A380 jumbo jet. He said he also remained skeptical about the Army's armed helicopter program, the one big new contract EADS has its sights on, given moves by Defense Secretary Robert Gates to quash or delay any new programs. U.S. EXPANSION O'Keefe acknowledged the challenges that EADS faced on the A400M program but said they were no different than those the U.S. government had seen on many major weapons programs, especially those structured as fixed-price development deals. He firmly rejected any characterization of aid from European governments for the A400M as subsidies or launch aid. EADS was still planning to market the A400M to the U.S. military, O'Keefe said, and said the company, with $60 billion of revenue globally, had many other capabilities that it was only just beginning to introduce to the U.S. market. He said the company was focusing heavily on expanding its role in providing a broad range of defense services, including after-market maintenance of fixed-wing aircraft, and helicopters, as well as radar equipment and electronics. O'Keefe said EADS and Northrop officials were "on exactly the same page" late last week in determining that the Air Force's terms for the latest tanker competition, valued at up to $50 billion, favored Boeing's smaller 767-based tanker. He said Northrop made the decision not to "continue the journey" based on its assessment of the costs and risks. EADS, which had seen the tanker deal as a way to move some commercial operations to the United States, had a different view on the risks it was willing to accept, he said. But EADS had no way to find another U.S.-based partner in the short time before bids were due on May 10. While EADS has expanded its capabilities to serve as a prime contractor for the U.S. government, it still lacked the expertise with such a large contract to justify a solo bid at this point, O'Keefe said. He said EADS remained committed to continuing to expand its presence in the U.S. market and had no plans to close its engineering center in Alabama or other U.S. facilities. If anything, the tanker episode had strengthened EADS resolve in the U.S. market. "We're not going anywhere." O'Keefe acknowledged that he moved into his job with EADS at a difficult time but said he was up to the challenge. O'Keefe is no stranger to difficult assignments, having arrived to lead the Navy in 1992 in the wake of the Tailhook sexual assault scandal. He took over as NASA administrator in 2001, tasked with cleaning up a near $5 billion cost overrun on the international space station, and then had to deal with safety and management lapses blamed for the 2003 loss of the shuttle Columbia. "I look back to the stuff that I've done, and keep thinking, what's next?" he said, laughing. "A lot of friends of mine said, 'Tell me where you're going next so I can ... stay away from there because you seem to really draw these.'"
