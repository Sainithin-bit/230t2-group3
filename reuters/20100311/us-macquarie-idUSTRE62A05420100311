 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Macquarie Group Ltd ( MQG.AX ), Australia's largest investment bank, wants to add more bankers in the United States to advise energy, industrial and technology companies, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday, citing an interview with a top company executive. 

 Tim Bishop, chief executive officer of Macquarie Capital's U.S. division, told Bloomberg in an interview that the bank has "eyes and ears open" for opportunities in the United States. Bishop said that Macquarie wants to make a business out of advising mid-sized companies -- those with market value under $5 billion -- on mergers as well as stock and bond offerings. "There really is an opportunity for a traditional investment bank in the U.S. that is focused largely on the mid market, not trying to be everything to everybody, where we think in a relative sense there's more limited competition," Bloomberg quoted the executive as saying. Macquarie has almost 300 bankers in the United States, according to the report. It said that Bishop declined to specify how many more bankers may be added.
