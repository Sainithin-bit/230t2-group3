 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Global stocks rebounded and oil edged higher on Thursday on renewed optimism over the U.S. economy, overcoming a scare that interest rates may be heading higher because of an inflation spike in China. 

 The benchmark S&P 500 climbed to a 17-month closing high in a late-day rally sparked by rising retail and banking shares, including a 5.6 percent jump in Citigroup Inc ( C.N ). Shares worldwide had been under water for most of the day after the spurt in Chinese inflation to 16-month highs sparked concerns China may tighten monetary policy sooner rather than later to curb economic growth and inflation. Oil settled 2 cents higher but remained under pressure from the inflation scare and worries in other markets that the U.S. Federal Reserve might signal the end of its zero-rate policy next week at a meeting of Fed policy-makers. Benchmark costs for banks borrowing dollars around the globe rose to a 3-1/2 month high as next week's meeting of the Federal Open Markets Committee loomed. Citigroup Chief Executive Vikram Pandit told investors that the bank is on track to return to sustained profitability and that local consumer lending was the biggest driver of performance of Citi Holdings in 2009. The KBW bank index .BKX rose 1.7 percent to a fresh 16-month high. Retailers posted big gains, led by a 2.4 percent rise in online retailer Amazon.com ( AMZN.O ), a day ahead of the U.S. Department of Commerce's monthly retail sales data. The S&P retail index .RLX added 0.8 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  closed up 44.51 points, or 0.42 percent, at 10,611.84. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  climbed 4.60 points, or 0.40 percent, at 1,150.21. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was up 9.51 points, or 0.40 percent, at 2,368.46. The dollar traded little changed versus major currencies after mixed data on U.S. trade and jobless claims failed to give investors direction. The U.S. trade gap narrowed unexpectedly in January as oil imports fell, while the number of U.S. workers filing new applications for unemployment insurance was slightly more than expected last week, hinting at a slow labor market recovery. "The dollar is really struggling to find direction and I think investors are likely to shift their focus to tomorrow's retail sales number," said John Doyle, foreign-exchange strategist at Tempus Consulting in Washington. The U.S. Dollar Index .DXY was down 0.22 percent at 80.268. The euro was up 0.16 percent at $1.3681, and against the yen the dollar was up 0.03 percent at 90.54. U.S. crude for April settled up 2 cents at $82.11 a barrel and later climbed as high as $82.38. London ICE April Brent fell 20 cents to settle at $80.28 a barrel. "There's a lot of uncertainty on what the next market move will be. It's consolidating at this point," said Andy Lebow, broker at MF Global in New York. Most U.S. government debt posted narrow price losses, but the sale of $13 billion worth of 30-year bonds concluded the Treasury's third auction this week and calmed concerns about a sated appetite for U.S. debt. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was down 1/32 in price to yield 3.72 percent. Spot gold prices turned around to trade $1.50 higher at $1,109.30 an ounce.
