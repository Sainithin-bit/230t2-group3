 OMAHA, Nebraska  (Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Saturday said he would like family-owned German businesses to consider his Berkshire Hathaway Inc ( BRKa.N ) ( BRKb.N ) insurance and investment company as a suitor when they are ready to sell. 

 "We want more family owners of German businesses ... who, when they feel some need to monetize their business, think Berkshire Hathaway," Buffett said at the company's annual meeting. "We want to be on their radar screen." Buffett said he is leaving later this month for a four-country European trip, in which he will look for potential acquisitions. Berkshire has about 76 operating units, Buffett said. Most operate primarily in the United States. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel, editing by Jackie Frank)
