 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - German chemicals company BASF 
BASF.DE has felt the repercussions of a financial crisis 
mostly in North America and expects the global market for 
chemicals to grow by 2.8 percent this year, its chief executive 
told a German weekly. 

  "We have been feeling the effects primarily in North 
America, in the automotive, construction and furniture 
industries...anywhere major purchases are involved," Juergen 
Hambrecht told WirtschaftsWoche in comments published on 
Saturday.  Hambrecht also said he expects an average oil price of $90 
per barrel and the dollar to be on average at 1.50 euros.  "The oil price is exaggerated right now. Too much oil is 
being produced," Hambrecht said, adding that a decline in world 
economy and slower growth rates will result in a lower oil 
price.  BASF, the world's biggest chemicals company by sales, 
benefits from global high oil prices through its oil and gas 
exploration activities.  (Reporting by  Nicola Leske )
