 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Darden Restaurants Inc ( DRI.N ) reported a nearly 30 percent drop in quarterly net earnings on Tuesday as fewer customers hurt sales and food and acquisition costs rose. 

 The parent of the Olive Garden and Red Lobster restaurant chains also scaled back its profit growth target for the year because a weak U.S. dollar is making imported products more expensive to buy. Its shares fell 7.5 percent in extended trade. "We were unable to meet our expectations for earnings growth," Chief Executive Clarence Otis said in a statement. Second-quarter net income slid to $43.5 million, or 30 cents per share, in the second quarter ended November 25, from $61.7 million, or 41 cents per share, a year ago. The company, which has more than 1,700 full-service restaurants, said costs from its acquisition of RARE Hospitality and a legal settlement reduced earnings by 12 cents a share in the most recent period. Darden completed its roughly $1.2 billion acquisition of RARE Hospitality International Inc during the quarter. Many full-service restaurant chains have struggled this year as consumers spend less on meals outside the home because of higher gas and food prices and a lackluster housing market. In addition, restaurant companies have been hit hard by a sharp run-up in prices on key commodities such as milk and wheat. Total sales from continuing operations rose 17 percent to $1.52 billion, helped by the addition of RARE chains LongHorn and The Capital Grille. WEAK TRAFFIC, HIGH COSTS Same-store sales, a key retail measure that tracks sales at restaurants open at least 16 months, rose 3.2 percent at Olive Garden and climbed 0.1 percent at Red Lobster, mainly due to higher menu prices. Customer traffic fell at Red Lobster in each of the three months of the quarter and was flat to slightly down at Olive Garden. LongHorn same-store sales were down 2.5 percent for the period as customer traffic dropped. Operating profit fell at both Olive Garden and Red Lobster, in part due to higher food, beverage and labor costs, the Orlando, Florida company said. For fiscal 2008, Darden still expects same-store sales to rise between 2 percent and 4 percent for the year. Earnings per share are expected to increase between 7 percent and 9 percent, excluding acquisition costs. That's down from a previous view of 10 percent to 12 percent. Darden blamed the impact that the weaker dollar is having on commodities and the price of imported products for the lowered view. Including acquisition costs, earnings per share are expected to rise between 2 percent and 4 percent. Darden also owns the smaller Bahama Breeze and Smokey Bones restaurant chains, though Smokey Bones is expected to be sold to an affiliate of Sun Capital Partners within the next 30 days. Darden shares fell to $33.60 in extended trade after closing at $36.34, up 1.3 percent, on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by  Nichola Groom ; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)
