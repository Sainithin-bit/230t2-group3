 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Financial Accounting Foundation, which oversees U.S. financial accounting rule makers, plans to propose an overhaul that would allow the Financial Accounting Standards Board to act faster and boost the power of its chairman. 

 The proposal is expected to be unveiled as early as Tuesday, said FAF spokeswoman Christine Klimek. Under the proposal, FASB's size would be reduced to five members from seven and the chairman would have the power to make decisions about what goes on the board's agenda, said Klimek. FAF is responsible for the oversight and administration of FASB as well as the Governmental Accounting Standards Board. News of the FASB proposal was reported in Tuesday editions of the New York Times. Under the proposal, FASB also will require specific backgrounds for its members -- with at least one from investing, another from auditing, another who specializes in preparing financial statements and an academic. It currently has no formal rule about the backgrounds of its members, though they have generally fallen into one of those categories. FASB has been criticized in the past for skewing too heavily toward those with an auditing and preparing background. Giving the chairman power to decide what goes on the board's agenda may also speed up the board's process, as currently an agenda decision requires a vote by the entire board. The proposal will be made available for public comment, Klimek said. The FAF trustees will then vote on the proposal, possibly at an already scheduled February 26 meeting, she said.
