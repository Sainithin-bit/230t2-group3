 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - Dutch food group Ahold's ( AHLN.AS ) former U.S. unit chief has agreed to pay $8 million to Ahold in a settlement related to the food group's $1.43 billion accounting scandal in 2003, Ahold said on Tuesday. 

 Former U.S. Foodservice Chief Executive James Miller and Ahold will end pending litigation and the settlement did not imply acknowledgement of liability by Miller, Ahold said. Ahold sold its catering supply business U.S. Foodservice earlier this year. (Reporting by  Foo Yun Chee )
