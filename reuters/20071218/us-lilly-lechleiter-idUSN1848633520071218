 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The slated new chief executive of Eli Lilly and Co ( LLY.N ) on Tuesday said his scientific training and previous experience as a company chemist will help the Indianapolis drugmaker "bring new molecules forward" and maintain its research prowess. 

 John Lechleiter, who is scheduled to take the baton on April 1 from longtime CEO Sidney Taurel, has also headed regulatory affairs and the company's far-flung pharmaceuticals operations on his 28-year climb to the top at Lilly. "My experience equips me to meet the company's biggest challenge, which is to bring new molecules forward," Lechleiter said in an interview, noting that he intends to give his scientists the breathing space needed for invention. "As CEO, I will be careful to allow scientific leaders to carry out their functions without me trying to serve as their surrogate," said Lechleiter. Lilly intends to remain focused on the areas of diabetes, neuroscience, cardiovascular medicine and osteoporosis, but is also taking a bigger interest in multiple sclerosis and other diseases, Lechleiter said.
