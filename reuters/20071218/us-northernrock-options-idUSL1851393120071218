 (Reuters) - Britain offered to guarantee more of Northern Rock's NRK.L liabilities, deepening its involvement in the troubled mortgage bank as the government battles to find a private sector buyer. 

 Facing growing speculation it could be forced to nationalize the country's fifth-largest mortgage lender, the government extended its guarantees to include virtually all Northern Rock's senior debt obligations, a move aimed at providing stability and at protecting the bank's credit ratings. The auction process for Northern Rock has been thrown into doubt in recent weeks, but at least two high-profile suitors remain, including preferred bidder Virgin and investment group Olivant. The following are options ahead for Northern Rock. A solution could involve a combination of these options: NATIONALISATION The government could take over the running of the bank and assume responsibility for all its assets. This is now seen as an increasingly serious option. It had been seen as a long shot as it could create a lasting problem for the government on a similar scale to the past nationalization of Railtrack. But financial bookmaker Cantor Index now rates the chance of temporary or permanent public ownership at 4/5. "As the credit crisis deepens, despite central bank intervention, public ownership ... looks like an 'odds-on' shot to many," said David Buik at Cantor. Nationalization could take several forms, including closing the bank to new business and running off the mortgage book over several years to shrink the balance sheet. It could release more value for shareholders than other options, but it would take a long time and require extended government financing support. PRIVATE SALE Regarded by Northern Rock and others as the preferred option. A consortium led by Virgin wants to take a majority stake, install new management and keep the company listed. It has been in "accelerated" talks after initially being picked as the preferred bidder. Cantor rates Virgin's chances of victory at 9/4. Rival Olivant would parachute in a new executive team, keep Northern Rock as a going concern and keep it listed. Several of the bank's biggest shareholders support its proposal, and Cantor rates its odds at 7/4. U.S. buyout firms JC Flowers and Cerberus have withdrawn from the process but could still return if the auction stumbles. Cantor rates Flowers at 5-1 and Cerberus at 10-1. Each suitor would be expected to immediately repay 10 billion to 15 billion pounds to the government and the rest of Northern Rock's loan within three years. ADMINISTRATION Putting the bank into administration is an option, but this would leave nothing for shareholders and could cause more political fallout with thousands of lost jobs. Deposits would also probably be frozen for a period of time and the process is long and involved. The government would probably be repaid slowly as mortgages are paid back. BREAK-UP The bank could be broken into various assets, such as tranches of mortgages and customer deposits, which could each be sold to the highest bidder. This could attract interest from several of the parties that are rumored to have lodged interest, such as Dutch bank ING  ( ING.AS ). (Compiled by Steve Slater; Editing by  Elizabeth Fullerton )
