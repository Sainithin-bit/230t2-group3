 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ) is cautious about the near-term outlook for its business, the company's chief financial officer said on a conference call for reporters on Tuesday. 

 Goldman Sachs CFO David Viniar said the subprime market is closer to reaching a bottom, but is not there yet. Viniar said there will be many leveraged buyouts in 2008, but not the "mega public-to-private" deals seens in prior years. (Reporting by  Joseph A.
