 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Electronics retailer Best Buy Co ( BBY.N ) said on Tuesday that its fourth-quarter earnings will be pressured by a calendar shift that added selling days to the third quarter as well as an extra week in the year-earlier fourth period. 

 "Earnings will be constrained by the loss of the 53rd week from last year and the shift of the holiday shopping week into Q3 of this year," Jim Muehlbauer, finance chief for U.S. operations, said during a conference call. Best Buy, which posted higher-than-expected third-quarter results, also said it expects a "strong finish" to the holiday selling season but cautioned that its gross profit rate would fall modestly in the fourth quarter.
