 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ) Chief Financial Officer David Viniar said on Tuesday redemptions from some poorly performing hedge funds would accelerate in the new fiscal year. 

 The disclosure represents more bad news for an asset management business that, in contrast to its high-flying parent company, was hit hard by market turmoil this year. Further redemptions could drag on management and incentive fees and weigh on first-quarter results. "Redemptions across our (quantitative) funds in the fourth quarter were around $3 billion, and close to half of that was in Global Alpha," Viniar told analysts on a conference call to discuss fourth-quarter earnings. "And we expect redemptions in the first quarter will be even greater." For years Global Alpha was one of the fastest growing funds in the market, but last year the flagship offering lost 12 percent of its value. This year, the fund lost about $6 billion, or 60 percent of assets, to trading losses and then withdrawals, bringing its value down to $10 billion. Meanwhile the Global Equity Opportunities fund, a long-short fund where trades are directed by computers, plunged 30 percent in value during the August market swoon. The decline prompted Goldman to orchestrate a $3 billion capital infusion, roughly doubling the fund's assets. Viniar on the conference call said Global Equity Opportunities again fell in value during the fourth quarter, though it still gained on the year. Overall in the fourth quarter, Goldman Sachs asset management revenue rose 25 percent to $1.17 billion. Assets under management swelled by $72 billion or 9 percent from the third quarter to $868 billion. More than half of those inflows were in money market funds. About $16 billion represented new money put into fixed income and equity funds. Despite its fund difficulties, Goldman's asset management arm generated $4.49 billion of net revenue over the fiscal year, reflecting higher management and other fees. Assets under management rose by $192 billion, or 28 percent, from a year earlier. Quarterly results were partly offset by "significantly lower" incentive fees, the bank said, reflecting the poor performance of the Global Alpha fund. Goldman recently launched a distressed debt fund and a credit markets fund, and next month will introduce a long-short equity fund with more than $6 billion in assets. The bank says the new funds represent an effort to offer a broader choice of actively managed investments. (Reporting by Joseph A. Giannone; Editing by Tim Dobbyn/ Dave Zimmerman)
