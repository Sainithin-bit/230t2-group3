 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co ( LLY.N ) said on Tuesday chief executive Sidney Taurel will retire on March 31, turning the reins over to Chief Operating Officer John Lechleiter as the drugmaker prepares for tough times ahead. 

 The appointment of Lechleiter, 54, comes ahead of looming patent expirations on three of Lilly's top drugs. The CEO-designate earlier this month said the company will face "its biggest challenge" ever as the drugs contend with cheaper generics, but he said new Lilly products would help offset lost revenue. "My experience equips me to meet the company's biggest challenge, which is to bring new molecules forward," Lechleiter said in an interview on Tuesday. He said he intends to give Lilly scientists the breathing space needed for invention. The 58-year-old Taurel's retirement and the selection of Lechleiter to succeed him had been widely expected since Lechleiter was promoted to COO in October 2005 and assumed ever greater responsibility and a higher profile with the Indianapolis-based company. Lechleiter came to Lilly in 1979 as an organic chemist and over the next 15 years took a number of senior executive roles in research and development, including stints in England and Europe. In 2004, the year before he became Taurel's top deputy, he was named head of Lilly's pharmaceutical operations. Lechleiter said Lilly's future success could hinge in part on its ability to create medicines tailored for the genetic makeup of patients, a discipline Lilly calls "tailored therapeutics." "We want to make sure the right patients get the right dose of the right medicine at the right time," Lechleiter said. Lehman Brothers analyst Tony Butler predicted Lechleiter will continue Lilly's pattern of forging partnerships with other drugmakers -- the kinds of deals that have brought it the widely used impotence treatment Cialis, and Byetta for diabetes -- while coaxing important new drugs from Lilly's laboratories. HIS FORTE "Understanding how to make a drug and how to deal with regulators have been his forte and will serve him well as CEO," said Butler, who noted Lechleiter headed regulatory affairs for Lilly in the mid-1990s before taking charge of pharmaceutical operations. "Over the last decade, Lilly has been one of the most innovative companies, producing novel drugs and not losing sight about the importance of research, and that's what John brings to the table," Butler said. Taurel joined Lilly as a marketing associate in 1971 and took the helm of the company in July 1998. He has been chairman since early 1999. He will continue as board chairman until the end of 2008, Lilly said. Under Taurel, Lilly has been recognized for its research, developing medicines that have become blockbuster products, including schizophrenia treatment Zyprexa, anti-depressant Cymbalta and chemotherapy agent Gemzar. But Lechleiter acknowledged in an earlier Reuters interview this month that it will be difficult for Lilly to make up the revenue shortfall when those three drugs face patent expirations between 2010 and 2012. "There's no question we will face the biggest challenge of our history at the beginning of the next decade, but we're confident we can meet that challenge based on new products being launched before and during that period," he said. Toward that end, Lechleiter said Lilly aims to launch two new drugs per year, on average, beginning in 2011, increasing to three per year by 2014. It aims to move at least 10 additional drugs into late-stage studies by 2011. The company also has financial strength to license or buy more drugs, said Lechleiter. At a Lilly meeting with investors and analysts in New York on December 6, Taurel remained largely out of the spotlight, allowing Lechleiter to take the lead in describing company strategy. Lilly shares traded up almost 1 percent to $53.67 in late-afternoon trading Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange, in line with gains for the drug sector.
