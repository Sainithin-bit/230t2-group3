 KANSAS CITY, Missouri  (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, on the second day of a tour seeking to build support for a mortgage relief plan, said on Tuesday it was not a bailout for people who made bad decisions. 

 "Foreclosures are very costly to lenders and investors as well as harmful to homeowners," Paulson said in an interview on Fox News Channel. "There's no bailout with government money, none whatsoever." Earlier this month, Paulson unveiled a proposal that would temporarily freeze low introductory or "teaser" rates on subprime mortgage loans for five years so that some borrowers would not face the loss of their homes when their loans reset at higher rates. The Bush administration proposal has met skepticism, with some critics warning it may make lenders wary about future lending because they see the government stepping in to change terms. Others say people should bear the consequences of bad decisions. At a meeting with about 200 community members, including bankers, housing counselors and activists, Paulson defended Treasury's role in helping broker the mortgage relief plan by saying that it was only intended to bring market participants together, not to interfere with normal market processes. "The role of government is to prevent a market failure," Paulson said. "We don't want to do things that would cut off funds (from lenders) in the future." Kansas City was the second stop in a coast-to-coast swing Paulson is undertaking this week to discuss the program. He was in Florida on Monday and will travel to California later on Tuesday. NEW FED RULES In a move to avoid a repeat of the loose lending standards that have put many Americans at risk of losing their homes, the Federal Reserve Board on Tuesday proposed new protections for subprime borrowers Under the proposal, U.S. lenders would have to determine borrowers can afford a mortgage before making the loan. In addition, borrowers will get details on their brokers' compensation and be billed monthly for annual charges like property tax and insurance. Paulson told Fox that a wave of interest-rate resets coming in the next two years required action, but unlike in the past, it was more difficult for lenders and mortgage holders to negotiate new loan terms, since many mortgages have been split up and sold as securities around the world. "So what the industry has done is come up with some streamlined procedures to fast-track these modifications to approximate what would have happened under normal market conditions if there was more time," he said. Addressing the community forum, Paulson described the weak housing sector as the biggest single risk to the national economy now, but: "We think and believe we are going to continue to grow." He said "rampant appreciation" in housing markets had created conditions for the current housing slump. "This downturn was inevitable," Paulson said. (Editing by  Neil Stempleman )
