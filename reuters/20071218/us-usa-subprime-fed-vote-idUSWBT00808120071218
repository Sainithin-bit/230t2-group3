 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve, under pressure from Congress to more fully deploy its consumer protection powers, on Tuesday proposed toughening lending practices to mortgage borrowers with poor credit histories. 

 The Fed's Board of Governors voted 5-0 to issue the rules that would apply to all mortgage lenders, including those not regulated by the U.S. central bank. The public will be allowed 90 days to comment on the proposed changes to the rules implementing the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act. (Reporting by  John Poirier ; Editing by Neil Stemplemanx)
