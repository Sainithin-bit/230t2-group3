 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Sprint Nextel Corp ( S.N ) on Tuesday named former Embarq Corp EQ.N Chief Executive Dan Hesse as its president and CEO, effective immediately. 

 Hesse, 54, succeeds Gary Forsee, who resigned in October after the No. 3 U.S. mobile service provider had posted more than a year of customer losses. Hesse had been chairman and CEO of Embarq since its inception in 2006. Prior to Embarq, he served as CEO of Sprint's Local Telecommunications Division for a year before the spin-off that created Embarq. (Reporting by  Tiffany Wu ; editing by John Wallace)
