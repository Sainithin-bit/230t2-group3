 JOHANNESBURG  (Reuters) - Africa's top media group, Naspers Ltd ( NPNJn.J ), said on Tuesday it would buy UK Internet auction firm Tradus TRDS.L for 946 million pounds ($1.90 billion) to extend its reach into central and eastern Europe. 

 South Africa-based Naspers' shares tumbled as much as 11 percent as investors worried the group was paying too much, while Tradus' stock rose nearly 12 percent after the announcement. The directors of Tradus, which operates online trading platforms and related Internet services across 11 European countries, said they would recommend the offer to shareholders. "My initial reaction is that the price being offered for Tradus seems very steep, being at multiples similar to that offered for similar Chinese businesses, which poses huge investment risk," Yasmine Ganief, a Cape Town-based analyst at Old Mutual Investment Group said. "At the same time, I like the fact that they are getting increased exposure to Eastern Europe, especially Poland, which offers good investment prospects in a fast-growing economy." Tradus, formerly QXL Ricardo Plc, runs auction sites in Poland and Switzerland, Russia, Bulgaria and Romania. Under the deal, Naspers will pay 18 pounds for each Tradus share, representing a 19 percent premium to the mid-market closing share price of 1,510 pence on November 6, the day before Tradus said it had received an approach that could lead to an offer. Naspers said the deal amounts to about 13.2 billion rand. Naspers would use existing resources and bridge funding of 700 million pounds by Citigroup ( C.N ) for the offer, it said. "We think its a reasonable, fair price if you look at the prospects going forwards. It's normal to pay a premium of 15-30 percent in these kind of deals," Cape Town-based Naspers' Chief Financial Officer Steve Pacak told Reuters. "We see the reach it provides us into eastern European emerging markets, with high economic growth and high Internet penetration as very appealing. Media growth is not in print, its in Internet and that's where we want to be going into." Apart from Africa, Naspers owns stakes in firms in Brazil, Russia, India and China and targets emerging markets and beef up its Internet and electronic media business, Pacak said. Naspers owns roughly one-third of China's Tencent Holdings Ltd ( 0700.HK ), a market leader in Internet, mobile and telecoms value-added services and online advertising. Naspers said apart from the investment in Tencent and Kalahari, an African e-tailer, other Naspers platforms have not yet generated transaction income, but mainly relied on revenue from advertising and value-added communication services. Naspers said Tradus would provide transaction income. NASPERS SHARES TUMBLE Naspers shares were the biggest blue-chip faller, trading 9.1 percent lower at 164.55 rand against a 0.9 percent decline on the Top-40 index  .JTOPI  at 8:42 a.m. EST. "It seems a little bit expensive. People feel they may be over-paying and that's why it took a smack," one trader said. Tradus' shares rose 11.48 percent to 1,806 pence in London. Tradus shares jumped 10 percent on November 7 after the approach was announced and an analyst said at the time a buy-out figure of 21.62 pounds per share was reasonable for fast-growing Tradus, which in October beat expectations for the first half with a 165 percent rise in pretax profit to 3.68 million pounds. Naspers began investing in Internet firms in 1997 and as has units in Africa and India, and is about to take a controlling stake in Gadu Gadu S.A., an Internet business in eastern Europe. In Russia, Naspers is developing Mail.ru into a market leader. Naspers, which owns the continent's biggest pay-TV network, DStv and South Africa's top-selling newspaper the Sun, will hold a conference call on the Tradus deal on Wednesday at 9:00 a.m. EST.
