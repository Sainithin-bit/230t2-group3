 JOHANNESBURG  (Reuters) - Africa's largest media firm Naspers Ltd ( NPNJn.J ) will buy British-based Internet auction company Tradus (QXL Ricardo Plc) TRDS.L for 946 million pounds ($1.90 billion), the company said on Tuesday. 

 The deal, which South Africa's Naspers said amounts to about 13.2 billion rand, will see it pay 18 pounds for each share of Tradus, which represents a 19 percent premium to the mid-market closing price of 1,510 pence per Tradus share on November 6. The directors of Tradus said they considered the offer to be fair and would recommend it for acceptance by its shareholders. (Reporting by James Macharia)
