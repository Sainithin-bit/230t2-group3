 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Pepsi Bottling Group Inc. PBG.N said on Tuesday that fourth-quarter net income rose, helped by better pricing and volume growth. 


 Net income increased to $133 million, or 55 cents per share, from $74 million, or 30 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding a 22 cent-per-share gain from the reversal of tax reserves, the largest bottler of PepsiCo Inc. ( PEP.N ) drinks earned 33 cents per share. Analysts, on average, were expecting 32 cents per share excluding items, according to Reuters Estimates. The latest results also included 5 cents per share in stock option expenses, the company said. Net revenue rose to $3.77 billion from $3.66 billion a year ago, helped by a 3 percent increase in pricing and a 2 percent increase in sales volume. The company affirmed its 2007 forecast, saying it expected full-year earnings of $1.92 to $2 per share, excluding the potential impact of an accounting change. Analysts, on average, are expecting $1.97 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Like other bottlers, Pepsi Bottling is struggling with higher costs for raw materials such as aluminum, sweetener and drink concentrate.
