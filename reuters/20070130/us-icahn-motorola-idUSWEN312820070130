 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. billionaire investor Carl Icahn wants Motorola Inc MOT.N to return more of its $12 billion in cash to shareholders and take on more debt, according to a report on CNBC on Tuesday. 


 Motorola said earlier in the day that Icahn would seek a seat on its board and has taken a 1.4 percent stake in the world's second biggest handset maker. Icahn is only seeking a board seat at Motorola for himself, CNBC said citing a telephone interview it had with Icahn. The financier believes Motorola should take on a buyback possibly in the form of Dutch tender, for as much as one-third of its market capitalization, according to the cable channel.
