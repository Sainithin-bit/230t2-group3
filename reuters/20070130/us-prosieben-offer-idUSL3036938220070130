 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - KKR and Permira PERM.UL launched a public offer on Tuesday to the remaining holders of shares in German broadcaster ProSiebenSat.1 PSMG_p.DE after agreeing to buy the majority from German Media Partners in December. 


 The private-equity firms offered 22.45 euros per listed, preference share -- slightly below the 22.46 euros per preference share they had said they were likely to offer -- and 28.71 euros per common, voting share. The offer runs until midnight on March 19. KKR and Permira said the 22.45 euros it was offering per preference share represented the volume-weighted average price in the three months before it announced it would make a public offer in December. ProSieben preference shares rose 1.6 percent to 25.97 euros by 0822 GMT against a flat German mid-cap index .MDAXI. German Media Partners, an investor group around U.S. billionaire Haim Saban, agreed in December to sell its stake of 88 percent of common shares and 13 percent of preference shares in Germany's biggest commercial broadcaster to KKR and Permira. The deal valued ProSiebenSat.1 at 5.6 billion euros ($7.2 billion), a valuation that is barely changed by Tuesday's slightly lower offer. KKR and Permira said its public offer was conditional on the German Media Partners deal closing. The other 12 percent of ProSiebenSat.1's voting shares are held by German publisher Axel Springer ( SPRGn.DE ), which was forced to abandon its own takeover bid for ProSiebenSat.1 last year by antitrust authorities. Springer has said it is considering its options and may sell its stake, hold it or increase it. The company had no immediate update on its plans on Tuesday.
