 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Motorola Inc. MOT.N said on Tuesday that billionaire investor Carl Icahn will seek a seat on the board and has taken a 1.4 percent stake in the company, pushing the cell phone maker's shares up more than 6 percent. 


 Icahn is known for pressuring management to improve performance in companies he holds. His presence on Motorola's board could prompt more aggressive measures from the No. 2 mobile phone maker to contend with flagging profits and operating margins, analysts said. "Just given (Icahn's) background, people could see that as a catalyst," said Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Walkley. "A lot of people believe Motorola has a lot of value that could be unlocked." Motorola said it received a notice of nomination from Icahn entities owning about 33.529 million shares of the company's outstanding stock. The company said it had no additional information on Icahn's intentions and it was reviewing the notice. Motorola has not set a date for its 2007 shareholders meeting. Officials at Icahn's office were not immediately available. "I think any time you can bring someone like that onto the board, it's going to be a win for Motorola," said Shawn Campbell, principal in Campbell Asset Management of Chicago, which owns Motorola shares. "Certainly Carl Icahn is somebody who's going to mix it up." Pressure on Motorola Chief Executive Ed Zander has grown as the company reported earlier this month a sharp drop in profit due to price cuts for its flagship Razr phone and tough competition in emerging markets. Motorola said it plans to cut 3,500 jobs in a bid to restore operating margins to double-digit percentage levels. But investors are looking for the company to produce a revenue-boosting successor to the Razr and fend off its larger rival Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ). RIPE FOR CHANGE If Icahn makes in onto the board, he would likely try to work with Zander and management, rather than against them, to push for change, analysts said. But some see Motorola as ripe for a structural shake-up. "If you break up the company, it's worth an awful lot more than it's trading right now," said JP Morgan's Ehud Gelblum, who rates the share at "overweight." In a recent note to clients, Gelblum said the share was highly attractive from "a private equity/sum-of-parts/break-up point of view," even though there was no evidence its management was pursuing any of those strategies. Motorola shares have slipped 26 percent off their most recent high of $26.30 in mid-October, just before it reported third-quarter revenue that missed Wall Street forecasts. That compares with a 4.5 percent rise on the Standard & Poor's 500 Index in the same period. The Icahn news will likely boost Motorola shares in the near term as investors wait for his next move, analysts said. "It doesn't always necessarily end up being change, but investors always wonder what kind of change he's going to force," said Prudential Equity analyst Inder Singh. In recent months, Icahn has put a spotlight on such companies as home builder WCI Communities Inc. WCI.N, where he increased his holdings, and building materials maker Temple-Inland Inc. TIN.N, saying he may urge management to divest one or more businesses there. Last year, Icahn led a call for a breakup of media conglomerate Time Warner Inc. ( TWX.N ) to wrest more returns for shareholders. While the company remained intact, it sped up existing strategic plans and instituted a $20 billion share buyback. Motorola shares gained $1.18 to $19.49 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Additional reporting by  Scott Malone  in Boston and  Tiffany Wu  in New York)
