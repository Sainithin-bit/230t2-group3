 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co. ( PG.N ) and its smaller rival Colgate-Palmolive Co. ( CL.N ) posted slightly better-than-expected quarterly sales and profits on Tuesday and signaled that their businesses look good for the rest of 2007. 


 Investors were pleased with Colgate's results, sending its shares up 1 percent in afternoon trading. Shares of P&G fell less than a percent as the company raised its sales and profit outlook for the fiscal year but its profit forecasts suggested that it may fall short of analysts' lofty expectations. P&G, which makes everything from Tide detergent to Folgers coffee, posted a 12 percent rise in fiscal second-quarter profit. Earnings of 84 cents per share matched analysts' average forecast, according to Reuters Estimates, but beat P&G's own forecast of 81 cents to 83 cents a share. Colgate, best known for its namesake toothpaste, posted an 11 percent rise in fourth-quarter profit. Excluding certain special items, it earned 78 cents per share, topping analysts' average forecast by a penny. Colgate stood by its earlier projection, calling for double-digit earnings per share growth in 2007. It also forecast the same growth for the current quarter and said that "excellent" trends should continue throughout 2007. "I think they are both very cognizant of managing expectations and kind of managing their growth," said Morningstar analyst Lauren DeSanto. TOOTHPASTE RIVALS Colgate and P&G are currently going head-to-head in the toothpaste aisle, with Colgate hawking its Colgate Total toothpaste with ads featuring Brooke Shields to compete against one of P&G's new products, Crest Pro-Health toothpaste. P&G Chief Executive A.G. Lafley said on a conference call that early consumer reaction to Pro-Health is positive and that he expects both Crest and Colgate to continue to grow. "I think this is the first chapter in a multi-chapter book and we're going to be talking about Pro-Health for a long time," Lafley said. Colgate, the No. 1 toothpaste brand in the U.S. market, announced a new entry in the toothpaste contest: Total Advanced Clean, which will debut in late February. Cincinnati-based P&G's sales, driven by Gillette razors, beat Wall Street expectations. Sales rose 8 percent to $19.73 billion, while analysts' average forecast was $19.61 billion. JP Morgan analyst John Faucher, who rates Colgate "overweight" and P&G "neutral," said P&G's 5 percent growth in organic sales, which exclude mergers and the impact of foreign exchange, might disappoint the market. P&G had forecast 4 percent to 7 percent growth, while Faucher had expected 6 percent growth and said he thinks the consensus was at 7 percent to 8 percent. Sales at Colgate, which also makes Hill's Science Diet pet food and Irish Spring soap, rose 10.5 percent to $3.21 billion, coming in ahead of the average forecast of $3.12 billion. P&G expects to earn $2.99 per share to $3.03 per share this year, including dilution from the acquisition of Gillette. It now expects dilution to be toward the lower end of its previous forecast of 12 to 18 cents per share. Analysts, on average, had expected P&G to earn $3.03 per share this year. For its fiscal third quarter, which ends in March, P&G expects to earn 72 to 74 cents per share, while analysts were expecting 74 cents. P&G expects organic sales, or sales excluding acquisitions and the impact of foreign exchange to rise 5 to 6 percent this year, versus its prior forecast of 4 to 6 percent. Total sales should rise 10 to 12 percent, it said. P&G forecast third-quarter organic sales growth of 5 to 7 percent and total sales growth of 7 to 9 percent. P&G shares closed down 29 cents, or 0.5 percent, at $64.59 on the New York Stock Exchange while shares of Colgate hit a new high of $67.55 before closing at $67.42, up 71 cents, or 1.1 percent. Shares of P&G, a component of the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI , rose 3.7 percent during the October-December quarter, while shares of Colgate advanced 5.1 percent.
