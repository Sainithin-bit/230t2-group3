 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co. ( PG.N ) posted a 12 percent rise in quarterly profit on Tuesday, driven by strong sales of Gillette razors, and raised its sales and profit outlook for the fiscal year based on the quarter's results and current expectations. 


 P&G, best known for products such as Tide detergent and Pampers diapers, earned $2.86 billion, or 84 cents per share in the fiscal second quarter, compared to a profit of $2.55 billion, or 72 cents per share, a year earlier. In December, Cincinnati-based P&G said it expected to earn 81 cents to 83 cents a share in the quarter. Analysts, on average, expected a profit of 84 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 8 percent to $19.73 billion, topping analysts' average revenue forecast of $19.61 billion. Looking ahead, P&G now expects "organic" sales, which exclude mergers and the impact of foreign exchange, to rise 5 percent to 6 percent this year, versus its prior expectations of 4 percent to 6 percent growth. Total sales should rise 10 percent to 12 percent, P&G said. P&G expects to earn $2.99 to $3.03 per share this year, including dilution from the acquisition of Gillette, which it now expects to be toward the lower end of the previous forecast of 12 cents to 18 cents per share. Analysts, on average, had expected P&G to earn $3.03 per share this year. For the current fiscal third quarter, which ends in March, P&G forecast organic sales growth of 5 percent to 7 percent, and total sales growth of 7 percent to 9 percent. P&G expects to earn 72 cents to 74 cents this quarter, while analysts were expecting the company to earn 74 cents per share. Shares of P&G rose 3.7 percent during the quarter, while shares of smaller rival Colgate-Palmolive Co. ( CL.N ), whose products include its namesake toothpaste, advanced 5.1 percent.
