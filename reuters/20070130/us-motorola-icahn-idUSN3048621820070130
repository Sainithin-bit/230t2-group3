 NEW YORK/BOSTON  (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Carl Icahn said on Tuesday he will seek a seat on Motorola Inc.'s MOT.N board and has taken a stake in the mobile phone maker, aiming to convince it to do a big share buyback. 


 The news sent Motorola's shares up 7 percent as investors hoped pressure from Icahn would boost the performance of the No. 2 cell phone maker, which has seen a sharp drop in profit due to price cuts for its flagship Razr phone and tough competition in emerging markets. Icahn said in a telephone interview that he wants Motorola to take on more debt and return more cash to shareholders in the form of a share repurchase. "I think they should do a big buyback," Icahn told Reuters. "They said their stock is very cheap and I happen to agree. I'm buying their stock and they should be buying their stock." Motorola stock has slipped almost 26 percent from its most recent high of $26.30 in mid-October, just before it posted third-quarter revenue that missed forecasts. That compares with a 4.6 percent rise on the Standard & Poor's 500 Index. The company said it received a board nomination notice from Icahn entities owning about 33.529 million shares or 1.4 percent of its stock. Icahn, who said he started buying Motorola shares on Friday, estimated his holdings at 40 million shares on Tuesday afternoon. He said he may call off efforts to get on Motorola's board if it does a huge buyback. Motorola has yet to set a date for its 2007 shareholders meeting and said the board would review Icahn's move. Icahn suggested a buyback in the form of a Dutch tender of up to a third of Motorola's market capitalization, according to a report on CNBC citing an interview with Icahn. This implies a buyback of $15.66 billion based on Motorola's Tuesday close. Motorola has bought back $4.7 billion worth of shares since May 2005 and has another $3.8 billion worth to buy by July 2009 under its current program. It has $11.3 billion of cash on its books and said earlier this month that it expects its $4.4 billion of debt to remain about the same for 2007. "It's not too hard to argue that they have more cash than they need," said one Motorola investor, Shawn Campbell, principal in Campbell Asset Management of Chicago. "At the face of it, taking a significant chunk of that cash and buying back shares is probably not a bad idea." PROFIT PRESSURE Pressure on Motorola Chief Executive Ed Zander has grown as investors look for a revenue-boosting successor to the Razr to fend off Motorola's larger rival Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ). Motorola has said it plans to cut 3,500 jobs in a bid to restore operating margins to double-digit percentage levels. Icahn is known for pressuring management to increase buybacks and to improve performance in companies he holds. Last year he criticized media company Time Warner Inc.'s ( TWX.N ) buyback program and pushed it to break up. Time Warner remained intact but instituted a $20 billion share buyback. Some analysts said Icahn's presence on Motorola's board may prompt more aggressive measures to boost profit margins. Others say Motorola is ripe for a structural shake-up. "If you break up the company, it's worth an awful lot more than it's trading right now," said JP Morgan's Ehud Gelblum, who rates the share at "overweight." In a recent note to clients, Gelblum said the share was highly attractive from "a private equity/sum-of-parts/break-up point of view," even though there was no evidence its management was pursuing any of those strategies. The Icahn news will likely boost Motorola shares in the near term as investors wait for his next move, analysts said. Motorola stock rose $1.27 to close at $19.58 on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday. (Additional reporting by  Sinead Carew  and  Tiffany Wu  in New York and  Scott Malone  in Boston)
