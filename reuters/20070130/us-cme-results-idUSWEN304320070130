 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings Inc. CME.N said on Tuesday that quarterly profit rose 33 percent on strong derivatives volume and an increase in electronic trading, but results missed analysts' estimates. 


 The parent of the largest U.S. futures exchange said fourth-quarter net income rose to $102.6 million, or $2.91 per share, from $76.3 million, or $2.18 a share, a year earlier. Net revenue advanced 26 percent to $281.3 million from $222.5 million. Analysts on average expected earnings of $2.98 a share on revenue of $286.5 million, according to Reuters Estimates. CME previously reported that average daily volume for the fourth quarter, at 5.3 million contracts, was up 29 percent on the year. Futures and options volume growth on Globex, CME's electronic trading platform, outpaced that for traditional open-outcry trading. However, CME's rate per contract, a key measure of margins, was 65.5 cents for the fourth quarter, up from 64.1 cents in the previous quarter but down 3 percent from a year earlier. Clearing and transaction fees rose 25 percent to $220 million, slightly short of the pace of total derivatives volume growth. Capital spending increased to $29 million from $25 million a year earlier. CME's working capital rose by some $73 million to $1.3 billion. Pretax margin rose to 59 percent from 55 percent. The exchange is in the process of taking over the Chicago Board of Trade BOT.N, the No. 2 U.S. futures mart. CME said it still expected that transaction to close at midyear, pending shareholder and regulatory approval. CME shares ended on Monday at $575.85, down $13.01 or 2.2 percent, but have risen 13 percent since the start of the year and hit a record of $596.26 on Wednesday.
