 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks edged higher on Tuesday as a 5 percent jump in oil prices lifted shares of major energy companies and Motorola Inc. MOT.N gained after investor Carl Icahn said he will seek a seat on the board. 


 But skittishness ahead of the Federal Reserve's interest-rate decision on Wednesday limited gains. U.S. crude oil futures prices shot up more than $2.50 a barrel on colder temperatures and a supply cut expected this week from OPEC producers. The rally prompted investors to buy shares of major energy companies such as Exxon Mobil Corp. ( XOM.N ), which rose 1.5 percent to $74.28 and gave the biggest boost to the S&P 500 index. "Everyone's been on the sidelines ahead of the Fed decision," said Mike O'Hare, head of U.S. equity cash sales and trading for JP Morgan Chase & Co. in New York. "The price of crude is huge monkey wrench," he added. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was up 16.03 points, or 0.13 percent, at 12,506.81. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was up 5.45 points, or 0.38 percent, at 1,426.07. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was up 3.48 points, or 0.14 percent, at 2,444.57. Higher oil prices, while boosting shares of energy companies, are a burden on the broader market because they mean increased costs for businesses and consumers. Crude oil for March delivery CLH7 shot up $2.59 to $56.60 a barrel. Chevron Corp. ( CVX.N ) shares rose 1.9 percent to $72.87 on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares of Motorola, the No. 2 cell phone maker, surged 6.7 percent to $19.53 in the largest daily jump in six months. On the Nasdaq, Starbucks Corp. ( SBUX.O ) rose 0.7 percent to $34.80 after JP Morgan raised its rating on the coffee-shop chain's stock, saying the company has long-term earnings growth potential of more than 20 percent.  Among declining stocks, 3M Co. ( MMM.N ) posted a weaker-than-expected quarterly profit and cautioned 2007 earnings could fall below estimates. Its stock fell 5 percent to $75.01, making it the biggest loser in the Dow. (Additional reporting by  Amanda Cooper )
