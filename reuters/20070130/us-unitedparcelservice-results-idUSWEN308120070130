 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc. ( UPS.N ) on Tuesday provided a full-year outlook for 2007 below analysts' forecasts, citing a slowing U.S. economy, and its shares fell 3 percent. 


 The package deliver company reported fourth-quarter results that met analyst expectations, citing a boost from peak season retail sales and strong growth in its international business. It reported fourth-quarter net income of $1.13 billion, or $1.04 a share, compared with $1.05 billion, or 95 cents a share, a year earlier. The figure met Wall Street's expected earnings per share for the quarter, according to Reuters Estimates. "The fourth quarter was no surprise one way or another, but the outlook for 2007 is a tad disappointing," said Morgan Keegan analyst Art Hatfield. "But given the current U.S. economic environment, they're probably being prudent with their outlook." Like its main rival, FedEx Corp. ( FDX.N ), UPS is often seen as a bellwether for U.S. economic health. UPS said it expected full-year 2007 earnings per share to rise by 6 percent to 10 percent, or within a range of $4.10 to $4.25, despite what Chief Financial Officer Scott Davis described in a statement as a "slowing U.S. economy." But UPS' outlook fell short of full-year earnings per share of $4.26 predicted by analysts. "I would rather see double-digit growth for the year, but given the state of the economy I will take 6 percent to 10 percent," said Peter Smith, an analyst at Morningstar. SLOW START UPS said it expected first-quarter earnings in a range of 91 cents to 98 cents a share, below analyst forecasts of $1 a share. UPS CFO Scott Davis told Reuters that the company based its expectations for 2007 on predictions the U.S. economy will strengthen later in the year. Davis also said the company expects its strongest growth this year to come from Asia. For the fourth quarter, UPS reported revenue of $12.6 billion, compared with $12 billion a year earlier. This was below revenue of $12.85 billion predicted by analysts for the quarter. UPS said net income as a percentage of revenue improved to 8.9 percent, compared with 8.8 percent a year earlier. Morningstar's Smith said that although the quarter had matched expectations, he would like to see better margins. "The operating margin is something that continues to plague UPS' results," he said. "It's beginning to look like they are going after market share rather than profitability." UPS said its holiday peak season saw the number of packages rise to 22 million on two days and more than 20 million on seven days, compared with five days in 2005. UPS said revenue at its international unit grew nearly 10 percent to $2.44 billion from $2.22 billion a year earlier. Revenue at the company's supply chain and freight business rose to $2.06 billion from $1.91 billion, despite a "general softening" in the less-than-truckload market. Less-than-truckload operators consolidate smaller loads into a single truck. Like the whole trucking sector, these companies have been hard hit by slowing U.S. economic growth. CFO Davis said UPS Freight, its less-than-truckload unit acquired in 2005, will target market share of 1 percent this year and for the next few years. UPS shares were down $2.25, or 3 percent, at $71.40 in late morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange but up from an earlier low of $70.38.
