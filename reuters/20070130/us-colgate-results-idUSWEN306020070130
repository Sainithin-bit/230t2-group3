 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Colgate-Palmolive Co. ( CL.N ) posted an 11 percent rise in fourth-quarter profit on Tuesday, benefiting from its focus on profitable areas such as oral care, personal care and pet food, and said its "excellent" trends should continue throughout 2007. 


 Earnings at the maker of Colgate toothpaste and Palmolive dish detergent increased to $401.2. million, or 73 cents per share, from $361.2 million, or 65 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding restructuring charges and a gain on the sale of the Canadian bleach business to Clorox Co. ( CLX.N ), Colgate earned 78 cents per share, topping the analysts' average forecast by a penny, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales increased 10.5 percent to $3.21 billion, coming in ahead of the analysts' average revenue forecast of $3.12 billion. Colgate's "excellent" sales and profit trends should continue through 2007, President and Chief Operating Officer Ian Cook, who is set to become chief executive later this year, said in a statement. In 2004, Colgate unveiled a restructuring plan that included cutting 12 percent of its work force and closing one-third of its factories. It said last year that savings from the program could come in slightly above its original expectations. Shares of Colgate, which also makes Ajax cleanser and Hill's Science Diet pet food, rose 5.1 percent during the quarter, outpacing shares of rival Procter & Gamble Co. ( PG.N ), which advanced 3.7 percent.
