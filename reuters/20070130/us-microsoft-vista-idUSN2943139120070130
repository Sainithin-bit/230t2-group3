 NEW YORK/LONDON  (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. rolled out Windows Vista in 70 countries on Tuesday, delivering a PC operating system able to better manage the explosion of digital media and enhance Internet security. 


 The world's biggest software maker called Vista, which required a $6 billion investment, the most important release of its dominant operating system since Windows 95 more than 10 years ago. Shoppers then waited hours to be among the first to run the new software. But no queues were evident at a Manhattan Best Buy on Tuesday. A smattering of shoppers were far outnumbered by reporters, blue-shirted store employees and aides accompanying Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer to a kickoff event there. Because only about 15 percent of existing computers have memory and graphics cards powerful enough to run premium versions of Vista, most users will have to buy a new computer if they want to upgrade. "I use it for work and my wife uses it for work. I'm going to see how this one works today and, if my wife likes it, I'm going to get another one tomorrow," said shopper Frank Solano, who bought a Sony Corp. notebook preloaded with Vista. Others were unaware of the hype. "I just came in looking for something else," said Giovanni Vrioni, as he browsed for a new PC mouse, adding he was happy with the PC he bought a few years ago. U.S. research firm IDC said it did not expect a significant boost in PC shipments due to Vista. "While more robust, stable and secure than Windows XP, we believe there aren't killer application-like features in Vista the way there were for Windows 95, which resulted in the proliferation of multi-tasking capabilities" IDC said in a statement. Microsoft's Netherlands chief, Theo Rinsema, at a separate launch event, said Microsoft would be "very content" if it could push PC sales up by 5 percent to 10 percent during the first six months after the Vista launch. GATES LAUNCHES VISTA IN LONDON Most analysts agree that Vista is not the dramatic leap in technology that was seen in past Windows releases. The most obvious change is the new look. Vista's "Aero" interface uses 3-D graphics to create translucent windows that appear to float above the background screen. Other changes are more subtle, such as improved security, search bars to help users find information more easily and a new multimedia platform for digital video, music and pictures. Apple Inc. calls Vista a copycat version of its Mac OS X Tiger operating system, which introduced many of the new features. The iPod maker plans to introduce a new operating system of its own later this year. Nonetheless, research reports say Vista will be installed on more than 100 million PCs worldwide. "Vista will be successful. It's been a long time since Microsoft introduced a new operating system. There are a lot of nice features that people will like," said Morningstar analyst Toan Tran. Windows runs on more than 95 percent of the world's computers and the long-delayed new version is the first major release of a new Microsoft operating system since it introduced Windows XP in 2001. Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates flew to London to drum up publicity for Vista, appearing at an event at the British Library. Vista has been criticized for being anti-competitive and for violating European Union practices. He strayed from the technology of the product to proclaim Vista's capabilities would be used to put online Leonardo da Vinci's famous Codex Arundel and Codex Leicester notebooks, making available the artist's drawings, mirror writing and theories to the public. The Codex Arundel is held at the library, while Gates owns the Codex Leicester after he paid $30 million for the manuscript in 1994. "We have just begun to see what we can do," Gates said.
