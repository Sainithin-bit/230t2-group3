 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s ( WMT.N ) Japanese unit, Seiyu Ltd. 8268.T, on Tuesday said it would fall deeper into the red for 2006 than it first estimated, with the supermarket chain struggling to boost sales in a tough market. 


 Seiyu will mark its fifth straight year of losses despite investments of more than $1 billion by Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, which owns 53 percent of Seiyu and sees it as a key to expanding in the Japanese market. "They still have yet to turn a profit, and it's unclear when they will be able to do so," said Kazunori Tsuda, senior retail analyst at the Daiwa Institute of Research. "Mind you, it's a very tough market and Seiyu has a very weak store portfolio," he said. Seiyu estimated its group net loss at 55.8 billion yen ($459 million), wider than its earlier projection of a 54.5 billion yen loss for the year ended December but in line with analysts' forecasts. Same-store sales rose 0.6 percent in 2006, the first annual rise in 15 years, but company spokesman Yasuhisa Nezu said that was still below the company's target. Seiyu also is mainly a supermarket chain and unlike other Japanese retailers such as Aeon Co. Ltd. ( 8267.T ) it does not have finance or specialty store operations to offset sluggish sales. Wal-Mart Vice Chairman Michael Duke told a Japanese business daily that the company might look for more acquisition opportunities in Japan. But spokeswoman Amy Wyatt said on Monday that Wal-Mart was more focused on expanding business at the Seiyu chain. Before the announcement, Seiyu shares closed up 2.6 percent at 195 yen, outperforming a 0.11 percent rise in the Nikkei average  .N225 .
