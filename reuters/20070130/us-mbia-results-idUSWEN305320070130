 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - MBIA Inc. ( MBI.N ), the world's largest bond insurer, on Tuesday said fourth-quarter fell, as insurance revenues declined. 


 Net income for Armonk, New York-based MBIA fell to $181 million, or $1.32 per share, from $182.7 million, or $1.34 a share a year earlier. Net income from continuing operations fell to $178.5 million, or $1.30 per share, from $184.1 million, or $1.36. MBIA on Monday said it agreed to pay $75 million to settle a two-year-old federal and state investigation focused on a 1998 reinsurance transaction.
