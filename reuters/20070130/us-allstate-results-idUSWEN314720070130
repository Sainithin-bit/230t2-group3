 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Allstate Corp. ( ALL.N ), the largest publicly traded home insurer in the United States, said on Tuesday that fourth quarter earnings rose 16.5 percent, helped by low catastrophe losses, but missed analysts' estimates. 


 Net earnings were $1.21 billion, or $1.93 a share, compared with $1.04 billion, or $1.59 a share, in the year-earlier quarter, when three hurricanes cost the insurer $5 billion in claims. Operating earnings for the Northbrook, Illinois-based property and casualty insurer were also $1.12 billion, or $1.78 a share. Analysts, who use operating earnings as their yardstick in rating insurers, expected the company to earn $1.84 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. In the year earlier fourth quarter, Allstate earned $975 million, or $1.49 before investment gains and losses. In aftermarket trading, Allstate fell to $63.74 from its close of $64 a share on the New York Stock Exchange. In 2006, Allstate posted a gain of about 20 percent, beating the Standard & Poor's 500  .SPX  by about 6 percent. Analysts, while raising estimates for the company, have also downgraded it, saying the property casualty cycle is getting more competitive, particularly in auto insurance, where Allstate is putting increased advertising dollars. But car insurers have been reporting good earnings in the fourth quarter. Safeco Corp. SAF.N said its net income rose about 13.5 percent, while auto insurer Progressive Corp. ( PGR.N ) profit was up 42 percent.
