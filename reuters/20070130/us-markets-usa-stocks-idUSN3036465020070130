 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed higher on Tuesday as a 5.5 percent jump in oil prices triggered a rally in energy shares, but caution before a Federal Reserve's interest-rate decision on Wednesday capped gains. 


 U.S. crude oil for March delivery settled at $56.97 a barrel, up $2.96. Shares of Exxon Mobil Corp. gained 1.6 percent to $74.39. Based on the latest available data, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 32.53 points, or 0.26 percent, to end unofficially at 12,523.31, while the Standard & Poor's 500 Index gained 8.20 points, or 0.58 percent, to finish unofficially at 1,428.82. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 7.55 points, or 0.31 percent, to close unofficially at 2,448.64.
