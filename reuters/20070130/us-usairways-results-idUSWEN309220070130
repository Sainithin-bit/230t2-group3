 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - The prospect of imminent airline industry consolidation faded on Tuesday as US Airways Group ( LCC.N ) reported no headway in its bid to take over bankrupt rival Delta Air Lines DALRQ.PK. 


 US Airways Chief Executive Doug Parker said his airline's nearly $10 billion bid for Delta is firm and that he has no intention of extending the February 1 deadline for Delta's official committee of creditors to respond. "We have given a deadline of February first (to) the official committee," Parker said on a conference call with analysts and reporters. "They know exactly what they have to do, and they know if they don't do it, our proposal is gone." Investors had hoped a US Airways-Delta deal would lead to more takeovers in the sector, which would cut competition and give surviving carriers an opportunity to raise fares. Airline shares dropped across the board, even after US Airways and discount rival JetBlue Airways Corp. ( JBLU.O ) reported quarterly profits, as oil prices jumped, heralding higher costs. Parker dismissed as "speculation" reports that the airline would increase its $9.7 billion bid for Delta. He said recent talk that US Airways has increased its offer by $1 billion is inaccurate and that he has not asked US Airways' board to increase the bid. Delta's management has resisted US Airways, saying that Delta is worth more as a stand-alone company and that a merger presents serious antitrust violations. Delta said on Tuesday it had lined up six major Wall Street banks for $2.5 billion in financing when it exits bankruptcy. Delta claimed that support by the banks -- including JPMorgan Chase & Co. ( JPM.N ) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. ( GS.N ) -- indicated Wall Street approval of its plan to exit bankruptcy as a stand-alone carrier. PROFITS FOR US AIRWAYS AND JETBLUE Parker made his comments after US Airways reported a quarterly profit, reversing a year-ago loss. US Airways also reported a profitable 2006, its first full year since the 2005 merger of US Airways and America West. JetBlue also reported a fourth-quarter profit, as both airlines benefited from strong travel demand and higher ticket prices. "All the work they've done in turning those airlines around is starting to pay dividends," said Calyon Securities analyst Ray Neidl. But shares of both airlines dropped in the face of surging crude oil prices. US Airways' stock fell $1.78 or 3.3 percent to $52.65 on the New York Stock Exchange. JetBlue shares fell 68 cents, or 4.7 percent, to $13.82 on Nasdaq. Crude oil, a barometer for airline's jet fuel costs -- which vies with labor as their biggest expense -- rose sharply on Tuesday. U.S. crude futures CLc1 were up 5.3 percent to $56.87 in mid-afternoon trade. US Airways, the No. 7 U.S. airline, reported fourth-quarter net income of $12 million, or 13 cents per share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $261 million, or $3.27 per share. The year-ago loss was made worse by a large fuel-hedge loss and some merger costs. Excluding special items, US Airways' profit was 91 cents per share, topping Wall Street's average forecast of 80 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. JetBlue, the No. 8 U.S. carrier by passenger traffic, also posted a quarterly profit, but forecast a loss in the first quarter on rising costs. The seven-year-old airline has reined in growth by delaying deliveries of some aircraft and selling others. It has also raised fares at the expense of filling seats as it seeks to improve earnings. These efforts helped JetBlue return to profit in the fourth quarter, reporting net earnings of $17 million, or 10 cents per share, compared with a loss of $42 million, or 25 cents per share, a year ago. Analysts expected a profit of 11 cents, on average, according to Reuters Estimates. Despite the improvement, JetBlue forecast a loss in the first quarter, expecting a pretax margin of negative 4 percent to negative 2 percent. It said unit costs were expected to rise 6 percent to 8 percent. Analysts had expected a profit of 9 cents per share. (Additional reporting by  Chris Reiter  and  Bill Rigby  in New York)
