 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oilfield services company Smith International Inc. SII.N said on Tuesday that its fourth-quarter profit rose significantly on strong performance at its Eastern Hemisphere operations. 


 Income in the fourth-quarter climbed to $143 million, or 71 cents a share, from $88.6 million or 44 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. Analysts polled by Reuters Estimates had on average expected a profit of 71 cents a share from the Houston-based company. Revenue in the period rose to $2 billion from $1.53 billion a year ago. Eastern Hemisphere operations revenue grew 40 percent over a year earlier due to continuing expansion in drilling activity, the company said.
